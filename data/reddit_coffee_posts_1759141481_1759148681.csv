Our team (Mobius) has been obsessing over a fundamental challenge in distributed robotics: the sheer impossibility of manually correlating multi-agent logs and telemetry during intermittent failures.

You all know the drill. A robot fails. You spend the next day and a half stitching together the timestamped logs from the main compute unit, the lidar, the motor controllers, and the external sensor array, trying to figure out which specific state estimate error on Agent B happened 15ms before the catastrophic motor command on Agent A.

# The Scale Problem

As systems get more complex (more sensors, more autonomy, more agents), the volume of data becomes less a resource and more a liability. Manual correlation methods and basic grep searches just don't scale when you're dealing with terabytes and non-deterministic logic.

# Our Approach: Statistical Anomaly Detection

We've been building a tool that uses machine learning to apply statistical anomaly detection across all synchronized data streams. The idea isn't to rely on hard-coded error flags, but to train the AI on ""normal"" operational telemetry, allowing it to flag subtle deviations in the system's multivariate state space.

We believe that by shifting from ""what broke"" (which is usually obvious) to ""what subtle deviation caused the break"" (which is usually hidden), we can cut the root cause analysis time by orders of magnitude.



# What's Your Current Workflow?

We're genuinely curious: How does your team currently handle log correlation for your most complex, intermittent bugs?

Are you primarily relying on:

1. Dedicated Visualization Tools (e.g., RViz replay, custom dash tools)?
2. Heavy Scripting/Data Science (Python/Pandas scripts to align timestamps)?
3. Sheer Engineering Intuition and lots of coffee?

We'd love to hear if you think this problem is still a major pain point and if an AI-driven, data-centric approach is the right way to tackle the next generation of robotics complexity.",1,1759147524.0,growmybusiness,0,1.0,False

Wow. I‚Äôve been using these monitors for 3 days and I feel like I‚Äôve hit the ceiling, like this is endgame, as they say around here. I haven‚Äôt tried anything better in IEMs and‚Ä¶ could there be something superior? Surely, but at what price?

The cable is terrible; the ear hook doesn‚Äôt fit well, and I don‚Äôt have big ears ‚Äî they‚Äôre normal-sized. Besides, it feels fragile, as if it belonged to a much cheaper segment of earphones.

There, I‚Äôve gotten that negative critique off my chest. Let‚Äôs move on to the sound, and no, I‚Äôm not going to talk about video games this time. I also listen to music. In fact, I analyze my IEMs for many hours with my FLAC files or high-quality audio.

On D'Angelo‚Äôs¬†*Unshaken*¬†(okay, it‚Äôs the Red Dead Redemption 2 soundtrack), the naturalness and roughness of the singer‚Äôs voice is fabulous. A deep voice that deserves to show all its detail and rawness is rendered with a resolution that truly left me speechless.

With Paco de Luc√≠a‚Äôs¬†*Entre Dos Aguas*, the strumming of the Spanish guitar is simply a sensation I‚Äôm savoring in full detail right now. Percussion elements like the flamenco caj√≥n sound with proper body, well-present, and holographically placed in the soundstage.

On¬†*Vampires*¬†by The Midnight, I can appreciate, at high volume and without any distortion, how its planar driver reproduces electronic music with precision, offering a detailed, bright listening experience, with vocals free of sibilance, a saxophone sounding transparently in an enormously wide stage, and background bass hitting with impact, control, and body.

Guys, I‚Äôm in love. I‚Äôve had three planar over-ear headphones, and I think these are the best I‚Äôve ever tried.

I‚Äôve hit the mark with exactly what I need and how I wanted to hear things. I hope they‚Äôre up to par for video games too (I‚Äôm sure they are).

And now today, it's three months. In mere hours, he will have drawn his last breath next to me while he ""napped,"" having been so tired, now understood with clarity that his heart all but blew up. 

I am lucky that I had 23 years. ""Lucky,"" HAHAHAHAHA!!!!! Yeah, _they're going to have to invent a new word_. Today, I wish with every cell in my body that I had the gift/curse he did, which was perfect memory. Pick a date, any date, and he could tell you everything about it. What the weather was like, what you were wearing, every detail of a conversation, the scent you were wearing, what you made for dinner, what songs you were singing (the one that means the most to me). Very few people have it: Hyperthymesia/HSAM. It made all disagreements with him absolutely maddening, because I would KNOW he was right, but my Celtic blood would not allow me to gracefully bow out, and I would try to convince the man there was some nuance he missed. But he didn't. Ever. But I did. I am only human. Just little ol' me. I want so much to have it so I can remember every second, every detail, carve them in marble or diamond or something that will last not just my entire life, but the Ages. Even the very last minutes, where I turned and saw he was gone, when I lost not just my love, but my own heart, my mind, and half of my soul. 

There is no negotiating reality anymore. Just as it was pointless to argue with the man who could tell you how you wore your hair on April 13, 2017. ""Acceptance"" is a bullshit word. Forgive my French. It doesn't apply. This is not something we accept, this is something we endure, we survive. I'm making it by scrubbing my memory every day, every night when I cling to the edge of my mattress so I don't feel the emptiness to my right, when I start the day in a house indecently silent, void of the sound of his size 14 feet, the shouted instructions to the dogs, the instruments of daily life like plates and glasses being put away, the jingle of the car keys as he escaped ""quietly"" to get me coffee because he knew by my slow start that I would need something extra to begin the day, to be my best. HE WAS MY BEST. 

He wanted no services, no wakes, no public displays of mourning. He wanted to be cremated and then IMMEDIATELY be released into the sea, which I did, down to the letter. He didn't tell me what he DID want, but it was okay, because I knew. He had so many gifts, but chief among them was an ear for music that was prodigious. He could catch snippets of ""borrowed"" musical phrasing across genres. To me, it became part of the ordinary, though he was anything but. When he died, he took music with him. I asked that there be no singing, no songs, because I wasn't ready. And I asked that in lieu of flowers or tributes, that those who chose to do so please send me a song. One that they knew he loved or one that reminded them of him. I've waited three months to complete the list. The only one that was missing was mine. And of ALL THINGS, it played on Friday, when I was attempting to drive home from picking up his death certificate, so distraught that I drove 35 minutes in the opposite direction of the house, yelling at Google maps that it was wrong, pleading to let me ""just go home,"" and the song came on the radio. I **NEVER** listen to the radio, but I had that morning for whatever reason, rather than a playlist from Amazon Music, which is what I always, _always_ do.  

You will never know this man, the center of my being. You have all missed out. I'm sorry you didn't have the opportunity to meet him. He would have loved _each and every one of you_, especially because you're in pain, would have done anything to help you, would have given his last dollar if you just asked for it, and would have done so with a smile, happy to have improved your day. So I want to share him with you, with the world, in the best and only way I can. I thought there might be duplicates when I received the songs from people online, many of whom I have never and probably never will meet in person. There wasn't a single repeat. Every track unique, just like him. So I am sharing who he was, what he meant, the music that surrounded him, flowed from him, and that I need to play because he is here, he is listening, and he is singing. Music was his language. I can't deny the song that he ""played"" for me on the radio on the way home on Friday. I had been waiting. And he spoke. And it was perfect.

I've been deep into the home-brewing game for about seven years now, and I thought I'd share what I've learned about espresso machines. Trust me, choosing the right one can be overwhelming with all the options out there.

First off, let's break down the main types:

Manual/Lever Machines
These are the old-school ones where you physically pull the lever to create pressure. I started with one of these, and while they're great for understanding the basics, they require serious skill. You're literally the barista, controlling every aspect of the shot.

Semi-Automatic Machines
These are probably what you're picturing when you think ""espresso machine."" You grind the coffee, tamp it, and press a button for the water to flow through. I currently use one I got from https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine and it's perfect for daily use. The learning curve isn't too steep, but you still get to feel like a real barista.

Automatic Machines
These do most of the work for you. Just add beans and water, press a button, and you're good to go. They're great if you want consistent results without much fuss. Some even have built-in grinders.

Super-Automatic Machines
The fancy ones! They do everything - grinding, tamping, brewing, and even milk frothing. I saw some amazing models at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine that literally just need you to press one button for a perfect latte. They're pricier but worth it if you want cafe-quality drinks without the learning curve.

Pod/Capsule Machines
These use pre-packaged coffee pods. While they're super convenient, I personally think they're limiting in terms of coffee selection and quality. Plus, not great for the environment.

Here's what to consider when choosing:
- Your budget (prices range from $100 to several thousand)
- Counter space (some are huge!)
- How much time you want to spend making coffee
- Whether you want to learn barista skills
- How many drinks you'll make daily

it's been great! over the last year i've had a lot of anxiety flare ups and insomnia, often focused on the feeling of my heartbeat, which then made me anxious, which made my heart pound more. had an ecg and everything is normal on that front, likely just anxiety and perhaps low iron symptoms. quitting caffeine has markedly improved this. my random bursts of physical anxiety involving heart racing have dropped dramatically.

i was also diagnosed with very low iron levels a few months ago, and have been on the appropriate treatment for that, too. i did see that caffeine could interfere with iron absorption, so at first i tried adjusting timings, before admitting that i should probably just give it up entirely (this was also due to the heart palpitations and anxiety). haven't had my bloodwork review but i do overall feel more 'awake', like what i was envisioning when i first started taking the iron supps. it's hard to say how significant giving up caffeine was in this process, but at the very least, cutting it out gave me some peace of mind that i wasn't interfering with my treatment. 

i did have some pretty nasty headaches for the first couple weeks, like the kind i would get if i accidentally forgot to drink coffee. freaked me out that they lasted that long, and that they felt like a pressure/tightness, but they did go away! overall i'm very happy with my decision, and have been enjoying lots of naturally caffeine free herbal teas :3",1,1759146884.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

But then it turned into bigger things. Concert tickets I bought for both of us. Uber rides when we went out. Even groceries a couple times. Every time he swears he‚Äôll pay me back. He never does.

I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up without sounding like a jerk. I don‚Äôt want to ruin the friendship but I‚Äôm starting to feel used. Part of me wants to just send him a total with a Venmo request. Part of me thinks if I do that he‚Äôll just ghost me.

1ntfwo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1ntfwo0/groovebox_for_a_non_musician_with_zero_edm_culture/,Groovebox for a non musician with zero EDM culture,"TLDR; I have zero electronic music culture, know next to nothing about it, but I have sounds and rhythms in my head, and I want them out.

‚Äî‚Äî

Call me a -very- late bloomer, but I want to try and make synthetic/electronic music at 46.¬†

It is a weird ¬´out of nowhere¬ª itch that is getting itchier, and that I would like to scratch.

I grew up in the  90s as a big punk/metal listener, with a heavy side of classic hip-hop.

I -badly- played the guitar in my teens/twenties, then let it fade, had a couple percussion phases with djembes, darboukas, etc, but never really been a musician, and trully I never was that much into music.

But I realised I constantly ¬´finger drum¬ª on whatever is laying around the kitchen counter while waiting for my coffee, hum melodies and beats while walking in the forest with the dog, and start to wonder‚Ä¶ what if.¬†

(I sometimes daydream about purchasing a hang drum, though. I think it would really be the perfect instrument for me, but that will be for another mid-life crisis episode üòÇ)

The magic of algorythms has made me more and more exposed to electronic music lately, and I am starting to realize how diverse and awesome it can be.

Almost never went ¬´clubbing¬ª, never went to a rave (that a whole other subject, but I am regretting it more and more üòÖ).

So, I have zero electronic music culture, know next to nothing about it, but I have sounds and rhythms in my head, and I want them out.

I remember I fiddled with an Ableton Live demo a decade ago, but I am pretty sure it is a wrong approach for me at the moment. I am a graphic designer, I am in front of a screen most of my working time, and Live felt like trying to understand a 3D software.

I have just discovered the concept of ¬´groovebox¬ª, that seems to be the nice cross between a real instrument and a DAW, and feel like this could be it. Some kind of standalone tool to vibe, try stuff, and have fun.

But there seem to be dozens, and the reviews I skimmed are either too basic or quickly too technical. They seem to range from very simple ones, with a couple pads to quicky put a beat together, to very complicated and expensive ones that seem to be able to sample, make drums, basses, melodies, etc. Learning curve, workflows and abilities seem to be vastly different, too.

Elektron Digitakt seem quite often recommended, as does Roland MC-707, the Novation Circuit Tracks/Rhythm (which?) seems more beginner friendly. But I have the feeling that Syntakt could be what I need, or Model:Samples/Cycles (again, which?) and I could buy the Teenage Enginnering products just based on how phenomenal they look‚Ä¶¬† ü•∞

So, as you can see, I am quite lost, have zero idea regarding what I am looking for, or even what I should be looking for.

I do not mind paying for something really good, as I do not want a ¬´toy¬ª that I would get bored from in 2 weeks. Ideally I do not want a too steep learning curve either, or tons of technical abilities I would never use. ¬´Relatively¬ª easy to learn, and ¬´relatively¬ª easy to use would be best. And fun. I reallisticaly never be a real musician, and probably will never attempt to produce very sophisticated and polished tracks. As I do not have enough musical culture, I also do not know if this or that tool would be better to make this or that kind of music, what kind of drums, synth, effects, filters, how many tracks, etc. I ¬´think¬ª I would be more interested in creating/manipulating drums and sounds and rhythms than sampling, but‚Ä¶ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So, with all that laid out, what would you recommend I do for this weird mid-life crisis?¬†

I have a coworker who in the last 6 months has become a good friend, we live 5 mins away from eachother so hang out quite a bit outside work. Recently i have started to notice more that i will have told her something that i do/i enjoy/i have done/i want to do etc. And i find her repeating these things to others in conversation as if they are her experiences. She will tell others she enjoys these things despite never doing them. Like for example i am very interested in history/local history and regularly take trips or go on hikes/tours of historical sites around the country and have done for years. Naturally ill tell my friend about it. But she will then tell others that this is a hobby of hers and recommed places to visit despite never having shown any interest in it or visited any of these places with me. Its really strange. Ive also noticed that she constantly subtly trys to ""one up"" me. For example ive complained that my team leader in work is so so slow to answer my emails (he is known around the office for slow replies or not replying at all) every time i complain about this to her she will say ""he alwaaays replies to me so fast"" hes not even her team lead...! Even today i was on the phone before work saying i will have to chase a contractor as he hasnt got back to me yet about arraging a date for works etc etc and immediately she said ""oh hes been up my arse"" which is slang for he is in constant contact. like ok girl ?!?! Its like constant recently and its getting really annoying.. does anyone have any idea why someone does this ? She will also tell white lies to me occasionally. Like lies that make no sense to lie about. For example we were planning to head to the city centre, i suggested taking a train from our nearest station as the carpark there is free. She said no its not free, bith me and my other friend both got clampled in that carpark.. i have been parking there for the past 10 years anytime i go to the city and have never been clamped..i just let it go bc i didnt want to argue. I looked it up on the county council website after our call and guess what.. IT IS FREE. So shes clearly lying.. but for what reason?!?!?! She can be a really nice person - offering to get me coffees offering to drive to places were going etc but this behaviour really puts me off.  For info she is 7 years older than me and we are both female. Im not sure if it is out of some sort of insecurity or is she just narcissistic. ",4,1759146363.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

A perfect day would be a dream ‚Äî peace and safety everywhere. What a beautiful day to go out and enjoy life, with people all around also enjoying their day.

I sat in a local coffee shop enjoying the morning. I had just tipped the lovely waitress; she said, ‚ÄúThank you, miss.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre very welcome,‚Äù in my masculine voice. She smiled warmly and went on tending to other customers.

I snapped out of my daydream, sipping my coffee in my hoodie and black beanie, my long hair pushing out at the sides.

It was September 29th, 2027. Our country ‚Äî once the United Kingdom, a proud nation making progress toward an inclusive society ‚Äî had descended into chaos. It was no longer safe to be trans. Groups were shut down, bans were everywhere, and hate lurked on every corner. Policing had almost disappeared, and only a couple of well-guarded social media outlets remained.

I asked myself, *How has it come to this?* Just a few years ago, before everything changed, a local woman lost her teenage child to suicide. I knew her child ‚Äî they were trans-femme ‚Äî and she had reached out to me for help. Of course I helped, connecting her with the local GIC and support that still existed at the time.

Her mother was a TERF, a prominent local figure and strong campaigner against the trans community. I still remember the look in her eyes the night we spoke ‚Äî anger fighting with grief, a flicker of something human she quickly buried.

>

In my private thoughts, I felt for this woman who had lost her daughter. I wished she had educated herself, supported her child. If she had made other choices, I would have reached out my hand to help. We could have been friends.

I am not your enemy and never will be. I want to be your friend. I just want to live my life and be happy.

Another sip of coffee, and my mind wandered again, drifting off to escape.

A loud bang jolted me out of my daydream.  
The waitress slammed the lock.  
The coffee shop fell silent.

Then shouting.  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the tranny whore ‚Äî get her!‚Äù

My body froze. My heart raced. Air caught in my throat.  
Move.  
Run.

I burst through the fire escape.  
Cold air.  
Footsteps behind me.  
Faces waiting in the alley.  
No exit.

Spit hits my cheek.  
A fist.  
Another.  
My hoodie yanked.  
Fabric tearing.  
Hands everywhere.  
The smell of sweat, beer, metal.

‚ÄúStop! Please stop!‚Äù My voice breaks.

The pain comes in bursts ‚Äî white light, black spots.  
Bottles smash near my feet.  
A stone cuts my thigh.  
Someone kicks.  
Someone laughs.  
I taste blood.

Naked.  
Shaking.  
Everything slows.

I look up.  
The crowd parts.  
She steps forward.  
The mother.  
Brick in her trembling hand.  
Her eyes flicker ‚Äî anger, grief, something unspoken.  
She raises her arm.

I can‚Äôt breathe.  
Can‚Äôt speak.  
But I reach out anyway.  
One last time.  
Toward her.

And now my song has ended.

Many years passed. The mother, tired and old, weakened with time. On her last day, she crossed over peacefully in her sleep.

She awakened.  
Not to darkness, but to a soft golden glow spilling across an endless horizon.  
The air shimmered like morning sunlight through mist, warm and cool all at once.  
A gentle breeze carried scents she had forgotten ‚Äî her child‚Äôs shampoo, wildflowers after rain.  
The weight she had carried for decades slid from her shoulders, leaving her lighter than breath.

Ahead stood two figures, radiant and whole.  
Her daughter and I, in our perfect forms, our faces serene, our hands outstretched.  
No blood, no bruises, only light in our eyes.

‚ÄúYou are forgiven,‚Äù we said together. ‚ÄúWelcome home.‚Äù

She stepped closer, hesitant at first.  
Then her hands lifted, trembling, and she reached toward ours.  
The moment our palms touched, the light surged, flooding her with understanding ‚Äî  
every cruelty, every regret, every chance lost ‚Äî  
and with it, a profound release.

There was no shame, no punishment.  
Only belonging.  
Only love.  
And at last, she understood.",1,1759145826.0,MtF,0,1.0,False

It seemed like a great fit for my skills and what I was looking for, so when they made me an offer with a 25% salary increase, I accepted immediately. Two days after I signed the offer, I got a call from HR and one of the VPs. They informed me that their 'fully remote' policy means I must work from my home address only. No working from a nearby coffee shop, the library, or even my partner's house across the country. They said they monitor IP addresses and VPN usage daily to enforce this policy.

 Honestly, I was speechless. I understand the legalities around taxes or securing sensitive data, but to advertise a remote job and then pull this after I signed is a huge deception. The whole point of wanting a remote job is the flexibility, otherwise I'd just work from an office, you know? But this is where it got really wild. The HR person called me again and had the audacity to tell me it was my fault for not clarifying their exact definition of ""fully remote"" during the interviews. She then admitted she intentionally didn't bring it up because several other candidates had withdrawn their applications upon learning about this policy, and she ""didn't want that to happen with me.'""So, of course, I rescinded my acceptance. 

When I did, the same HR person told me this was a 'learning experience for both of us' and that she ""hopes I learned my lesson"" and 'won't string other companies along in the future."" String them along? I'm still stunned by the audacity of them hiding a deal-breaking piece of information, admitting they did it on purpose, and then trying to pin it on me.

Solving the 1st layer was easy, then I was stuck on the 2nd layer for a loong time, trying to figure out the corners and then the 3rd layer cross... Then I finally figured out that the best way is to solve the 2nd layer corners and the 3rd cross simultaneously. When I could reliably (albeit it still takes a while, it's probably the most time consuming part for me), get the cross on top, those last 4 corners were just... staring at me and laughing in my face. Every time I'd try and do anything with them, I would mess the whole thing up.

Then, that's the part where I had just a tiny bit of help. I read a comment about conjugators. Specifically the 3 part one (not sure if that's what it's actually called), where you do 3 moves to move a piece, then move the entire layer, and do it backwards? In the beginning I could never do it right, I messed up every time and I thought I just don't understand how conjugators work, so I forgot about it. Then yesterday I was showing it to my husband, who knows how to solve it using the wide-known algorithms from google, and I was telling him about conjugators, and somehow I did it correctly, and there it was. A nice, pretty, correctly aligned corner. Then I did it again and fucked up the whole thing and went to cry in the corner.

Today, during morning coffee, I managed to repeat all the steps, got two corners in correctly, and then the other two were... in the correct spot, but orientated wrong. Just... sitting there. Wanted to smash it with a hammer.

Then... I did a move that I do when solving the 1st layer corners, thinking ""this surely won't work but what the hell"" and IT WORKED.

So now I can say I solved the cube (almost) entirely by myself. Not sure if this impresses anyone here, but at least I managed to impress my dad.

**Key Points**

* **The Pentagon‚Äôs equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials has investors wondering where the Trump administration might invest next.**
* **The federal government needs to invest in additional miners to diversify the rare-earth supply chain, Energy Fuels CEO Mark Chalmers said.**
* **The MP deal could serve as a blueprint for interventions in other critical mineral markets like lithium, executives, analysts and lobbyists say.**

The Trump administration needs to strike multiple deals with U.S. miners to secure the nation‚Äôs supply chain against China, said Mark Chalmers, CEO of¬†[Energy Fuels](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UUUU/), a miner focused on uranium and rare earth minerals.

The Pentagon decision to take an¬†[equity stake](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/10/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rare-earth-magnet-maker-mp-materials.html)¬†in¬†[MP Materials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MP/), the largest U.S. rare earth miner, in July and support the company with a price floor surprised many in the industry, Chalmers told CNBC.

But it was a necessary step that the White House should now follow with more deals to diversify the U.S. supply chain and reduce the risk that would come with backing a single national champion, the CEO said.

‚ÄúOne company doesn‚Äôt fix it,‚Äù Chalmers said of the MP Materials deal. ‚ÄúYou have to have multiple deals to ensure that you don‚Äôt just have the company risk, because all companies aren‚Äôt going to deliver.‚Äù

The White House is ‚Äúnot ruling out other deals with equity stakes or price floors as we did with MP Materials, but that doesn‚Äôt mean every initiative we take would be in the shape of the MP deal,‚Äù a Trump administration official told CNBC.

Rare earths are key inputs in weapons platforms such as the F-35 warplane as well as consumer products like electric vehicles and smartphones. The U.S. is almost entirely dependent on China, which supplied 70% of rare earth imports in 2023, according to the¬†[U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf).¬†

China has manipulated the market by suppressing prices to drive Western competition from the market, said Ryan Castilloux, founder of Adamas Intelligence, a critical mineral market research firm. The MP deal demonstrated that the U.S. is willing to break with free market ideals and push back against China by mimicking its model of strategic capitalism when necessary, Castilloux said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen just how disadvantaged the free market view is versus a long term, industrial policy driven market ‚Äî and something needed to give,‚Äù Castilloux, an expert on critical minerals, told CNBC.

# Possible rare earth targets

Energy Fuels‚Äô stock has surged nearly 200% since the MP deal on July 10, as investors speculate that it could be a deal target for the Trump administration. **Critical mineral miner**¬†[**NioCorp Developments**](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NB-CA/)¬†**is also up almost 200%**,¬†[Ramaco Resources](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/METC/)¬†has gained 140%, and¬†[USA Rare Earth](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/undefined/)¬†is up more than 70%.

MP Materials will likely need more heavy rare earths as it develops a second facility to make magnets under the Defense Department deal, Castilloux said. Heavy rare earths are needed to produce magnets that can withstand high temperatures in EV motors and defense industry applications, he said.

Headquartered in Denver, Energy Fuels is the largest uranium miner in the U.S. and is forming a rare earth operation through mines it has acquired around the world. Its operation will produce heavy rare earths, Chalmers said.

Energy Fuels is focused on ‚Äúproviding a product that is attractive to the U.S government‚Äù and complements the strengths of MP Materials, the CEO said.

‚ÄúThe government cannot bet on one horse ‚Äî it just doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù Chalmers said. ‚ÄúWe spend a lot of time in D.C. making sure they understand the merits of our strategy,‚Äù he said.

# Trump eyes lithium

Other critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and graphite are ripe for federal investment to smooth out volatile price fluctuations that undermine U.S. miners, said Rich Nolan, CEO of the National Mining Association. Those minerals are all used in batteries, among other applications.

The Trump administration has¬†[proposed an equity stake¬†](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/lithium-americas-lac-equity-stake-trump-stock.html)in¬†[Lithium Americas](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/), as the Canadian company renegotiates the terms of a $2.2 billion loan from the Department of Energy for its Thacker Pass mine in northern Nevada. The mine is expected to become one of the largest sources of lithium in North America, with the first phase of the project scheduled to start operations in late 2027.

Lithium Americas stock surged more than 90% this week on news of the potential government stake.

[Albemarle](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ALB/)¬†CEO Kent Masters told CNBC that something ‚Äúin the ballpark‚Äù of the MP deal could apply to the lithium sector. Albemarle, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, is one of the largest lithium producers in the world.

‚ÄúWhat you want to do is move the market such that private industry can invest behind it,‚Äù Masters told CNBC in July, pointing to¬†[Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/)‚Äôs¬†[offtake agreement](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/15/apple-mp-materials-magnets-rare-earths.html)¬†with MP just days after the Defense Department deal.

# Scandium Canada pushes forward with patented aluminium-scandium alloys for 3D printing

[Scandium Canada pushes forward with patented aluminium-scandium alloys for 3D printing](https://www.alcircle.com/news/scandium-canada-pushes-forward-with-patented-aluminium-scandium-alloys-for-3d-printing-115654)

https://preview.redd.it/hai1hndq83sf1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e2572e9bfee37f795ace1dd29263f3ad4d2b9c1

Scandium Canada Ltd, an advanced materials company focused on scandium alloys, has reported new data showing that its scandium-modified AA535 and AA7075 alloys deliver an economically viable technological advancement in the field of aluminium-scandium (Al-Sc) alloys for additive manufacturing. The findings, based on laser powder-bed fusion (L-PBF) printed samples, demonstrate that the alloys significantly reduce cracking in high-strength aluminium ‚Äì a major barrier in metal 3D printing.

The company highlighted that these alloys unlock a path towards lightweight, high-performance, and cost-effective components for aerospace, automotive, and advanced engineering. ‚ÄúScandium Canada‚Äôs proprietary alloys directly address the critical need for printable, high-strength, and lightweight metals in sectors such as aerospace, automotive, and advanced manufacturing,‚Äù said Dr Luc Duchesne, Head of Scandium+ and Chief Science Officer.

**Strengthening intellectual property portfolio**

This breakthrough builds on a provisional patent filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in September 2024 for alloy powders tailored to additive manufacturing. The patent ‚ÄúAluminium[¬†Alloy Powders for Additive Manufacturing](https://www.alcircle.com/news/innovative-aluminium-scandium-alloys-for-3d-printing-scandium-canada-ltd-moves-forward-with-patent-112054?srsltid=AfmBOopLRION65yjbmSDdhEBMt028BJXwx7S40SqAW_ZS1j0j-J3VgPe): Methods of Producing the Same and Uses Thereof‚Äù marked an earlier milestone in Scandium Canada‚Äôs IP expansion.

[a pinch of Scandium makes stuff ...\\""Better!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1ntff42/video/d818dn9cb3sf1/player)

More recently, on 17 September 2025, the company secured an international patent application under the PCT, strengthening its protection and commercial readiness. Both steps underline a long-term strategy of building a competitive edge in high-value materials.

**Scandium+ commercialisation drive**

The company has also established Scandium+, a dedicated division to accelerate market adoption. Its goals include deploying scandium where demand is strongest and advancing alloys such as AA7075/Sc/Zr and AA535/Sc/Zr/Ce. Notably, the alloys reduce scandium requirements without compromising strength, improving sustainability and lowering costs ‚Äì crucial for scaling 3D printing applications.

Mechanical tests show tensile strengths of 330‚Äì380 MPa in the as-built state, rising by up to 25 per cent after heat treatment, achieving relative densities above 99%, indicating excellent print quality and industrial reliability.

With a study under way with Productique Quebec to identify near-term commercial opportunities across more than 140 potential applications, Scandium Canada is positioning itself as a front-runner in advanced alloys. Its work with McMaster University reinforces Canada‚Äôs reputation in materials innovation.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

**IMHO ‚Äî** The U.S. critical minerals chessboard is shifting fast. **Titanium in the 1950s became mainstream only after government intervention, and we‚Äôre seeing a similar playbook today across multiple strategic metals.** The Pentagon‚Äôs scandium buy from Rio Tinto may have lit the spark, but Elk Creek‚Äôs value proposition runs far deeper: niobium for high-strength steels and hypersonics, titanium & TiCl‚ÇÑ for jets and armor, scandium for alloys, and REEs as the vertical integration lever. **NioCorp is uniquely positioned as the** ***only U.S. project capable of delivering all four in one package***\*\*.\*\*

The upcoming **October drill results** could be the most important near-term catalyst, with real potential to re-rate the entire deposit ‚Äî especially if TREO tonnage scales toward the 1,000,000t mark. That data feeds directly into the **Q4 DFS update**, which will finalize capex, opex, NPV, the RailVeyor plan, and lock in proven & probable reserves. **This is when the market, lenders, and offtake partners recalibrate their models ‚Äî a rerating event in every sense!**

Layer in the **Munich conference visibility**, **November scandium/alloy announcements**, and the looming **EXIM/DFC FID**, plus chatter of potential U.S. government or defense-prime stakes ‚Äî and you‚Äôve got a stacked ignition sequence.

**Elk Creek isn‚Äôt just a mine; it‚Äôs a multi-metal U.S. independence hub, answering four critical supply gaps at once.** The tape may move on daily news, but the chessboard is clear: **catalysts are lining up, and Q4 could be the quarter NioCorp gets fully re-priced. üöÄ**

# NioCorp ‚Äîis shaping into ~""The Flagship U.S. critical minerals hub!""~

# With drilling results due mid-October, Scandium alloy news in November, and a Q4 DFS into EXIM/DFC financing, the ignition sequence is stacked. üöÄ

# How to Use a Blog to Video Converter to Automate Your Social Media Content

## Key Takeaways

- **Boost Engagement:** Repurposing blog posts into videos dramatically increases engagement and reach on social media platforms that prioritize video content.
- **Automate Content Creation:** An AI-powered [blog to video converter](https://blogshorts.com/blog-to-shorts) saves significant time and effort by automating the video creation process, allowing for a consistent posting schedule.
- **How AI Works:** [Text to video AI](https://blogshorts.com) technology analyzes your article, automatically selects relevant visuals, and generates a complete video with captions, music, and a voiceover.
- **Simple Process:** The conversion process is straightforward: select a suitable blog post, prepare the text, generate the video with an AI tool, customize it with your branding, and share it on your social channels.

***

In today's fast-paced digital world, video is king. Everyone wants to watch short, snappy videos. But for content creators, bloggers, and marketers, making videos takes a lot of time, money, and effort. If you feel like you're always trying to catch up, you're not alone. The pressure to create amazing video content is huge.

What if you could turn your amazing blog posts into cool videos without a camera or complicated software? That‚Äôs where a **[blog to video converter](https://blogshorts.com/blog-to-shorts)** comes in. This powerful tool is a game-changer. It uses something called **content repurposing AI** to magically transform your written words into engaging videos. This means you can take an article you‚Äôve already written and turn it into a video for TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube in just a few minutes.

This post is your ultimate guide. We will show you exactly how to **convert articles to videos** and put your social media content on autopilot. Get ready to save time and reach more people than ever before.

## The Power of Video: Why Repurpose Your Articles?

Turning your blog posts into videos isn‚Äôt just about saving time; it‚Äôs one of the smartest moves you can make for your brand. Video content gets way more attention online. People love to watch, like, and share videos. By repurposing your articles, you unlock a whole new way to connect with your audience.

### Boost Engagement and Reach with Video

Have you ever noticed how many videos pop up on your social media feeds? That‚Äôs not an accident. Social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube love video. Their computer programs, or algorithms, are designed to show users more video content because it keeps them on the platform longer.

When you post a video, these platforms are more likely to show it to a larger audience. This means more likes, more comments, and more shares. A blog post might get a few clicks, but a video made from that same post could go viral. It‚Äôs a simple way to get more eyes on your hard work.

### Automate Social Media Content Creation

Creating new content every single day is exhausting. You have to think of new ideas, write them out, find pictures, and post everything. It‚Äôs a full-time job! Using a blog to video converter helps you **[automate social media content](https://blogshorts.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-ai-video-generators-automate-your-content-creation-in-2024)**.

Think about it: you already have a library of great blog posts. Each one is a treasure chest of ideas. Instead of letting them sit there, you can turn each one into a short video. This gives you a steady stream of fresh content for your social media channels without having to start from scratch every time. You can plan your content for weeks or even months in advance, giving you a consistent online presence that keeps your audience coming back for more. This is the core of smart video content automation.

### Grow Your Brand with an AI Video Marketing Tool

Every business and creator wants to grow their brand. To do that, you need to be seen and remembered. An **[AI video marketing tool](https://blogshorts.com/blog/from-blog-to-viral)** helps you do just that. Tools like a **blog to video converter** make it easy to create professional-looking videos that build your brand's identity.

You can add your logo, use your brand colors, and choose a consistent style for all your videos. This makes your content instantly recognizable. When people see your videos, they‚Äôll know they‚Äôre from you. This builds trust and authority. By consistently sharing valuable information in a video format, you position yourself as an expert and grow a loyal following. It‚Äôs a powerful strategy for long-term growth.

## What is a Text to Video AI and How Does it Work?

So, how does a blog post magically become a video? It‚Äôs all thanks to a very smart technology called **text to video AI**. This technology is like having a robot video editor that reads your article and builds a video based on what it says. It‚Äôs a sophisticated process, but it‚Äôs surprisingly easy to understand.

Platforms like [BlogShorts.com](https://blogshorts.com) use this advanced AI to do all the heavy lifting for you. It analyzes your words and automatically creates a dynamic short video, complete with visuals, captions, and a voiceover. Here is a simple breakdown of how this amazing technology works from start to finish.

- **Step 1: Text Analysis:** First, the AI needs to understand your blog post. It uses something called Natural Language Processing (NLP), which is a way for computers to read and understand human language. The AI scans your text to identify the main topics, important keywords, and the overall feeling or tone of your article. Is it a happy post? A serious one? The AI figures this out to choose the right visuals and music.

- **Step 2: Visual Selection:** Once the AI knows what your article is about, it starts looking for pictures and video clips to match. These tools are connected to huge libraries with millions of high-quality stock videos and images. The AI picks out visuals that are relevant to your text. For example, if you write about ""delicious coffee,"" the AI will find clips of people enjoying coffee or close-ups of coffee beans. This ensures your video is visually interesting and helps tell your story. Many modern tools, including [faceless video generators](https://blogshorts.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-faceless-video-creation-for-introverts-and-automated-content), excel at finding compelling visuals that don't require you to be on camera.

- **Step 3: Video Generation:** This is where everything comes together. The AI acts like a video director and editor. It takes the visuals it selected and arranges them in a sequence that makes sense. Then, it adds other important elements:
    - **Text Overlays:** It pulls key sentences from your blog and displays them as captions on the screen. This is great for people who watch videos without sound.
    - **Transitions:** It adds smooth effects between scenes to make the video flow nicely.
    - **Music:** The AI chooses background music that matches the mood of your article.
    - **AI Voiceover:** Many tools can even create a voiceover for your video. Using text-to-speech technology, a realistic AI voice reads your script aloud, making your video feel like a mini-documentary.

In essence, these platforms act as a dedicated **blog video creator**. They handle the entire technical and creative process, transforming a simple text document into a ready-to-share video in just a few minutes. It's an end-to-end automated video creation workflow designed for maximum efficiency.

## The Best AI Content Repurposing Tool Options for 2024

Choosing the right **AI content repurposing tool** is key to making your video creation journey a success. The market is full of options, each with its own strengths. However, an all-in-one platform that handles the entire process smoothly is often the best choice for busy creators.

[BlogShorts.com](https://blogshorts.com/blog/ai-generated-short-videos) is designed specifically for this. It excels as a blog-to-AI shorts video generator, focusing on creating the engaging, short-form content that dominates social media. It combines text analysis, visual selection, captions, music, and voiceovers into one seamless workflow, making it incredibly easy to turn your articles into shareable TikToks, Reels, and Shorts.

While BlogShorts.com provides a comprehensive solution, it‚Äôs helpful to understand the landscape of tools available. Here are some other notable players and the features they are known for:

- **Lumen5:** A popular tool known for turning blog posts into videos. It has a user-friendly interface and a large media library, making it easy for beginners to get started. It also offers many templates designed for different social media platforms.

- **Pictory:** This is a versatile AI tool that can create videos from many different sources, not just blog posts. It‚Äôs particularly good at creating short ""highlight reels"" from longer content. It also features automatic captioning and a wide variety of realistic AI voices.

- **HeyGen:** This tool specializes in creating videos with realistic AI avatars. You can choose a digital spokesperson to present the information from your blog post. This is great for creators who want a ""human"" touch without having to be on camera themselves. It's a powerful tool for explainer videos and corporate content.

- **Synthesia:** Similar to HeyGen, Synthesia is a leader in AI avatar technology. It is known for its high-quality, lifelike presenters and supports a huge number of languages, making it a strong choice for global brands and educational content creators.

- **VEED.io:** VEED is more than just a converter; it's a full online video editor. It has a feature to turn blogs into videos, but its main strength is its powerful editing suite. This is a good option if you want to generate a video and then make very detailed manual edits.

### Special Tools: The Article to Reel Generator

For creators focused entirely on short-form vertical video, there are specialized tools worth noting. Platforms like Munch and Opus Clip are excellent examples of an **[article to reel generator](https://blogshorts.com/blog-to-reels)**. Their primary function is to analyze longer content (like a podcast or a detailed blog) and automatically pull out the most interesting, shareable moments.

They then reformat these clips into vertical videos, add engaging captions, and suggest trending sounds, making them perfect for TikTok and Instagram Reels. Their ability to function as a **text to short video AI** makes them very popular for maximizing the reach of existing content on these fast-growing platforms.

While specialized tools are great, a platform like BlogShorts.com offers the best of both worlds‚Äîit‚Äôs designed for short-form video but gives you the flexibility and control to create exactly what you need from any text source.

## A Practical Guide: How to Convert Your First Article to Video

Ready to make your first video? It‚Äôs easier than you think. Let's walk through the simple, step-by-step process of turning one of your blog posts into an awesome short video using an **AI content repurposing tool**.

### Step 1: Select the Right Blog Post

Not all blog posts are created equal for video. Start by choosing one that will translate well into a visual format. Here‚Äôs what to look for:

- **Well-Structured Posts:** Articles with clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points are perfect. The AI can easily understand the structure and break it down into scenes. Listicles (""Top 5 Ways to..."") and how-to guides work great.
- **Strong Key Points:** Pick a post with clear, powerful messages that can be turned into bold text captions.
- **Evergreen Content:** Choose an article that will stay relevant for a long time. This is called ""evergreen content."" For example, a post about ""How to Save Money"" is better than one about a specific, temporary event. This way, your video will keep getting views for months or even years.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Text for the AI

While you can often just paste your blog post URL into a tool like BlogShorts.com, taking a few minutes to prepare your text can lead to even better results.

Copy the main points of your article into a separate document. Try to shorten your sentences and make the language more conversational, as if you were speaking to someone. This will become the script for your video. A good script helps the AI create a more focused and engaging video. You don't need to include every single word from the blog; just focus on the most important information.

### Step 3: Generate the Video

Now for the fun part! It‚Äôs time to let the AI do its magic.

In your chosen **blog to video converter**, you will typically have an option to either paste your blog's URL or your prepared script. Once you input your content, you simply click ""Generate."" The AI will get to work. In just a minute or two, it will analyze your text, find matching video clips, add captions and music, and present you with a first draft of your video.

### Step 4: Customize and Edit

The first draft the AI creates is usually very good, but the real magic comes from adding your personal touch. This is where you make the video truly yours. Here are the things you should customize:

- **Branding:** Add your logo. Change the colors and fonts of the captions to match your brand‚Äôs style. This helps with brand recognition.
- **Visuals:** Watch the video and see if you like all the clips the AI chose. If one doesn't feel right, you can easily swap it out for another one from the media library.
- **Timing:** You can adjust how long each scene stays on the screen. If a sentence is longer, you might want to give people more time to read it.
- **Audio:** Listen to the background music. Does it fit the vibe of your video? If not, browse the music library and pick a different track. If you‚Äôre using an AI voiceover, you can often change the voice, the speed, or the accent.

### Step 5: Export and Share

Once you are happy with all your edits, it‚Äôs time to finish up. Click the export or download button. Your video will be processed and ready to save to your computer.

Before you post, remember that different platforms have different rules. A video for TikTok or Instagram Reels should be vertical and usually under 60 seconds. A YouTube Short has similar requirements. Make sure you export your video in the right format for the platform you plan to use. Now, all that's left to do is upload your new video and watch the likes and comments roll in!

***

1ntfa9l,https://i.redd.it/awjvdwxe83sf1.jpeg,First ever pour-over attempt ‚òï,"So I finally tried making a pour-over today and yup, what a difference. I used Hermit‚Äôs Original Blend (usually have it as espresso), but this time it felt like a whole new coffee. Smooth, balanced, and honestly so much more layered, I could actually feel everything in the cup instead of the quick punch I get from espresso.

Didn‚Äôt expect it to be this calming either, the whole process was kind of therapeutic after a long day at work at Hospital. Definitely see myself doing this more often.

Anyone else remember their first pour-over and how it compared to espresso?

1ntfa7w,https://discord.gg/mkQ5Ap8sAv,Do you enjoy Lorna Shore? Do you enjoy Sleep Token? I'm looking for like-minded people if there is any/I'm not hopeful. I'm going a while and this is where I'll be chilling.,"I just wanted to make an updated post about the Discord server. I will be online on Reddit with my chat request open till Friday, and then I'm going to go away for a while.

However, I thought I would share some updates since my last post that I deleted, and I thought I should address some new updates about myself and the Discord server.

Here is the Discord server invite link; however, this link doesn't need to be clicked right away because you're interested right away. You should check the first pinned posts for a further explanation of the Discord server's rules than what the Disboard social link can provide on my Reddit profile. 

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLIg-7ZIdT4WaAAD4629BXLVXrJQG5tf

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha. 

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety. 

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me. 

Which I should also state, while I understand that the format seems confusing when I say I'm looking for friendship and other connections? I just can't be honest if I can expose my heart to someone right now, right away, and I can't say that's off the table right now. I opened my heart this month actually, simply and truthfully honest with the Redditors reading this. I'm just not in the mood to open my heart again; I just want to be friends, and if the connection builds, then that's not off the table. I'm just being honest with the Redditors here.

I've other ideas that might work for the Discord server and for people's creative outlets. 

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's spooky season and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.

Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?' 

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety. 

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary. 

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing. 

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night. 

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

With friends as well, maybe it's just me being a weirdo autistic woman, but I think it's cute to pinch your friends' energy drinks if your friends drink energy drinks? I just think that is cute, and if you can't tell by the few posts I've made here, I'm VERY autistic, and I know I am, haha. 

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile. 

That's also what I imply when I state that, given that, I'm just chilling/vibing inside the Discord server, tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break. 

However, with that being stated, I hope people can feel safe and relaxed in a stress-free Discord server where the people that are very introverted and have social anxiety have a toxic-free place to be themselves/chat with others when the vibe/mood is right for their liking. With the hopes of the cute animal pictures/videos of pets, or whatever backyard birds are outside, if anyone has any memes that correspond to the Discord server, it could help someone crack a smile through the darkness, and then that is good enough for me, and I would feel a sense of relief/enjoyment within myself if that goal were to happen.

I don't know, yeah, how many people vibe with this; however, wouldn't it be cute as friends to match the Sleep Token sticker and Lorna Shore sticker on our phone cases? I think that is adorable/cute, simply and truthfully. I would hopefully one day/this could maybe and might happen to match a lot of Sleep Token and Lorna Shore stickers with my online friends; that would be cool/awesome.

I‚Äôm 34 and it honestly feels like my life is just‚Ä¶ falling apart. Not piece by piece, but all at once.

I‚Äôm in the middle of a divorce. Seven years. No kids but we had a life together. And now it‚Äôs just gone. The house feels empty in a way that‚Äôs hard to explain. Every corner reminds me of her. Photos on the walls, mugs in the cupboard, the smell of coffee in the morning. It feels like living in a museum of my own failure. I keep walking around and touching things just to convince myself it‚Äôs still real but it‚Äôs not.

Friends don‚Äôt know how to deal with me. Some disappear. Some try to be there but don‚Äôt really get it. My parents keep telling me to stay strong and that time heals everything. But right now time feels like a cruel joke.

And then my job. I lost it last week. Just like that. I thought I had at least one stable thing left. Turns out I was wrong. Now I wake up in the morning and stare at the ceiling for hours. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I‚Äôm not sleeping well. I‚Äôm not eating properly. I don‚Äôt even reply to messages anymore because I don‚Äôt have the energy. I feel‚Ä¶ broken.

I‚Äôm not going to lie, sometimes I wish I could just disappear. Not die, but just vanish for a while. Maybe wake up somewhere else. Somewhere I don‚Äôt know. Somewhere it‚Äôs quiet. Somewhere I don‚Äôt have to explain myself.

I feel like I‚Äôve lost who I was. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm building toward now. I used to have a plan. Now I just have this empty, heavy space in my chest.

I'll be going away for a while though and this is where I'll be.,"I just wanted to make an updated post about the Discord server. I will be online on Reddit with my chat request open till Friday, and then I'm going to go away for a while.

However, I thought I would share some updates since my last post that I deleted, and I thought I should address some new updates about myself and the Discord server.

Here is the Discord server invite link; however, this link doesn't need to be clicked right away because you're interested right away. You should check the first pinned posts for a further explanation of the Discord server's rules than what the Disboard social link can provide on my Reddit profile.

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha. 

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety. 

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me. 

Which I should also state, while I understand that the format seems confusing when I say I'm looking for friendship and other connections? I just can't be honest if I can expose my heart to someone right now, right away, and I can't say that's off the table right now.

I've other ideas that might work for the Discord server and for people's creative outlets. 

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe.

1ntf48o,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ntf48o/the_grand_challenge/,The Grand Challenge,"The Grand Council stared in awe at the sight of the result. The Grand Challenge, a series of challenges designed by the founders many hundreds of thousands of years ago as a test for membership. The benefits of entry far outweighed the drawbacks, and generally, only one of these objectives had to be completed. The challenge was to acquire a number of randomly chosen planets, and exploit them, terraform them or mine them for a specific resource. Each planet had a unique challenge to overcome, a unique biome to inhabit or a unique resource the galaxy wanted to exploit.



Each time a challenge is completed, the empire that acquires whatever is there, will have, by mandate, the protection of the Galactic council for the duration of their membership. Along with this, they will have exclusive monopoly on the unique acquisition from this challenge, if they so choose, and tax free for the sale and distribution of that resource or tech, for one hundred years. Only one such challenge has to be completed for an empire to become incredibly wealthy or technologically advanced during these challenges. Only ONE actually has to be completed to earn membership.



They completed every last one.



They now have an almost complete monopoly on resource production on XXXXX unique planets. And they're about to become the most absurdly powerful empire in the Twelve Galaxies. We sat in the room desperately trying to make sense of the footage we were looking at. Its always too easy for competitors to fake their own footage, so we learned very early on to send our own auditors to record our own evidence. I hear that guy is now in therapy.



I understood why...



The first planet was known as Navaria, a world in the outer reaches of Imperial space that most of the galaxy ignored. This is for good reason. Although it is a fantastic source of nuclear fuel especially for growing colonies, it had been mostly abandoned due to the radiation level, and the local insectoids. Non sapient of course, so they are considered a free-for-all. Many empires had set up shop on the planet before to take advantage of the wealth of radioactive materials, uranium, plutonium, a naturally forming form of radium crystal.



The locals made every attempt a bloodbath for both the occupiers and the natives. The world itself would have been a boon for the galactic economy and made it easier to set up colonies, but the cost of fighting a nearly unlimited enemy force that seemed to evolve and scale according to the mining operations was just too great. The damn humans however, seemed to take it more as a challenge than anything else. They seemed to revel in it.



The humans have figured out that the planet's highly toxic oceans are a source of iron, copper, nickel and other industry critical materials, like their predecessors did. The humans however were the first to actually take advantage of this fact, and started to fill in spots of land after levelling mountains and cliffs for materials, and started building bases within isolated man-made islands. The dredging started in force, and humans managed to create continent sized factories that used exclusively local materials to sustain their operations.



This meant they had the economical option, as the only resource that needed to be shipped in was food and water supplies, as they simple dredged and sifted through the ocean beds for mineral rich silt. Shortly after they acquired a reasonable foothold, they began attacks against the natives, destroying nests with long range artillery pieces or heavy ballistic missiles, again, all made from local components. For the first time, the occupiers were winning the fight against the insectoid locals.



The first shipments of Radium Crystal and refined nuclear material started filtering through, dropping the price of colony startup projects within weeks. The sheer quantity of fuel was absurd. Then we saw it. The first nuclear attack against a nest! What were the humans thinking!? A large concentration of nests surrounded a considerable crust-deep deposit of uraninite ore, and their response was to use nuclear bombs to clear the nests, then use heavy cargo trains to transport the material from mines.



Insanity... But, who were we to argue with the results? Prices for colony projects and nuclear reactor components crashed almost overnight, allowing fledgling empires to expand faster and safer. the Council of course stepped in and supplied the humans with a¬† limitation on what they could export to the market to stop the economic impact. The humans just shrugged and carried on. When the Kukimbi attempted to exploit this planet... the entire expedition team was slaughtered by the natives. These humans seemed to be comfortable being there in a constant state of war against them.¬†



The next planet was Olegai, a world located within the borders of my home empire, the Saranai. A world of swampy marshes and toxic undergrowth dominated by massive trees and dangerous wildlife known as 'pentapods', strange five-legged abominations that could often reach sixty units in height. We long gave up attempting to access that world as dealing with the wildlife proved far too dangerous and unnecessary.



The problem is Olegai is saturated in plant life that produces certain types of mineral-based bacterial colonies. These bacterial colonies could be constituted and farmed to create an almost limitless supply of almost any mineral or metal one can think of, allowing anyone who controls the method of production to have access to a limitless eco-friendly starship industry. The humans figured out how not only to deal with the natives - really big guns - but also to cultivate strains of bacteria we never thought possible.¬†



By filling in swamplands with concrete and rockfill, they were able to create a stable land to build a massive factory, and used some kind of strange machine to plant, harvest and distribute the varying trees and plants that contained these bacterial colonies. These same machines that slammed seeds into the ground to plant trees, would also very precisely harvest the bacteria growths and plant matter that grew from them. The humans developed machines to sort spoiled or rotten organic material and recycle it for fuel or nutrients to feed the plants.



The bacteria farms were fields of glass domes dug into the ground that cultivated the bacteria that produced minerals during the decay process and almost immediately went into smelters the second they were ready. They even figured out a way to use the fruits and vegetables, even some of the mushrooms to use as a fertilizer when cultivating the bacteria to give a bigger harvest. With this, they very quickly built a rather large starship construction industry in orbit of the planet we thought was previously uninhabitable.



When the Cussavo attempted to work with this planet, the expedition failed in the first day. not for lack of trying, but instead because the bacteria nearly killed them all. Nobody bothered to work with the planet after that.



Magmatia was next. A world of lava oceans, fractured crusts, constant volcanic eruptions and tectonic shifts. And giant mineral-eating worms made of an almost impenetrable shell of tungsten, calcite, and compressed carbon known as 'Carbalite', which are immune to heat and are basically bulletproof. This planet would be easily exploitable for massive quantities of rare resources for mass starship building, if it weren't for the giant worms.



The humans seemed to have a trump card thanks to the extraction of nuclear fuel from Navaria. They just nuked the worms. Apparently even the worms that eat molten rock, are not immune to being obliterated by nuclear weaponry. Humans colonized and exploited this planet ten times faster than the others by a long shot. But what truly made it terrifying was the fact humans figured out a way to synthetically produce this 'Carbalite' substance, and not only use it for their industries, but also use it as starship armour.



They extracted the raw magma from the planets crust, used Calcite to react with it to produce ingots and plates, then smelted the result with steel and tungsten to create an alloy that was resistant to heat to such an extent, human warships equipped with this armour plating became practically invulnerable to laser weaponry. Within the space of a year of Magmatia being conquered, human warship fleets and ships could effectively ignore threats of invasion from half the galaxy at large. The armour plating by itself - as it turns out they figured out a way to use nanites to make it self-regenerating too, cutting their maintenance costs by eighty percent.



Cryonis was the next one they conquered. An ice planet rich in ammonia, lithium and water ice, critical components in the manufacturing of fuel for fusion reactors the galaxy over. The problem with this planet - as the Imdakano found out - was that it was so absurdly cold, that machines built on the planet would freeze solid and stop working. It was so cold, production lines, pumps and fuel lines would freeze over. If their operators didn't freeze first anyway. Humans found a way out of it.



They used Heating Towers that burned imported fuel cells to heat small locations, then used concrete and ice to pave over the oceans to expand. The factory would quickly grow, then the humans imported nuclear reactors. We wondered why. Turns out they didn't use them only for energy supply, they used the excess energy and heat from the reactors, in some strange new tech they had called Radiator Coils. These coils held heat so efficiently, they could be used to heat the entire facility without melting the foundation or ice underfoot.



The reactors would heat the coils, the coils would carry that heat for MILES at a time and maintain that heat so long as the reactors kept working, which the humans used to keep the factory working. In a matter of days the price of reactor fuel plummeted and a new age of trade began as the humans started to flood the market with what they labelled as 'cheap gas'.



Ocanim was an ocean world known for impossible depths and deep chasms that reached far into the planet's crust. A solid ocean of water with caves that stretched kilometres below the surface, and a massive wealth of biology that begged for exploitation. Galactic interest in this planet was located not in terms of its resources, but rather the food source. This planet was the prime ground for the galaxy's appetite for fish food, seafood and shellfish. Thousands of different species of fish saturated every part of the oceans.



The problem was the pressure. Fish didn't exist above certain depths due to storms and violent ocean surfaces so the only way to harvest any fish was to go underwater. The humans apparently had oceans on their home planet, as it didn't take them more than a week to start building submersibles in numbers that could catch fish of almost any size. The humans also solved the logistic issue of getting them off the planet. using the new Carbalite resource they could now mass produce - they built a Space Elevator.



They would also use the lightning storms around the elevator thanks to the planet's atmosphere to power everything. The storms would strike the elevator and they used strange rods to harvest the gigajoules of energy that would come from it. They quickly figured out a way to control the food industry with their production of not only fresh fish, but the introduction of a new dish the galaxy fell in love with - Sushi.



Corundium, what we considered an impossible place to ever set up industrial production, was the next planet they conquered. A planet of sulphur, methane and toxic acid rain that melted metal and armour. What did they do? They used the oceans of liquid methane gas that saturated the planet's surface and pumped it all into fuel generators. These gas generators produced a gas that mixed with the atmosphere and somewhat neutralised the acid rain near their facilities, while at the same time used the excess power for a shield system that covered their industries.



Powerful fuel rockets would transport massive blocks of sulphur rock off-world for market distribution that many empires needed for disposal of toxic material or garbage disposal via the use of a powerful industrial acid. Sulphur was the main catalyst for making this acidic compound the galaxy used to deal with their garbage. The best part? They did all this autonomously. No human ever set foot on the planet, and all production is automated using the simplest, stupidest system that we had ever seen.



Tenedium was their next port of call, a dark planet with a thick, anomalous atmosphere that blocked all sunlight and created an atmosphere that caused strange, random occurrences. Gravitational anomalies, random millisecond duration black holes that would swallow equipment and personnel, random points that would teleport users to random places, to name a few.



The reason this planet was so interesting? Anyone who controlled this world could effectively unravel the secrets of the universe. This planet could, if you could find a way to prevent catastrophic destruction, be used for comprehensive study of physics, maths and other subjects. This planet's entire being seems to be a microbiome of a galaxy in its own right. Time and space warp in odd ways, physics misbehaves, as if the planet is a 'glitch' in the universe. Its primary export would be raw data for scientists to comb over to unravel the mysteries of the universe.



Well you get the idea of this report by now... They figured out how to create technology that was hardy enough to defy the laws of the planet's 'glitchy' physics. Something called a 'Universe Engine' apparently. Something they built that could project a field of 'unreality' that somehow managed to stabilise the bases they used to work with. Then they would store all the raw data on databanks and computer drives, then send millions of copies out of the planet's surface via large cargo rockets.



The only caveat is that humanity is actively sharing this tech and data with anyone and everyone, even if they never asked for it.



Secretia is a planet that apparently humans REALLY liked. The galaxy had long since used the star system and its gravity enriched Gas Giant Frozetia as a dumping ground for derelict craft, broken ships or unsalvageable wreckage for millennia. Humans found the place, cleaned it up and started reverse engineering basically everything that they could get their meaty digits on. Toxic wastelands, oceans of frozen crude oil, lakes of reactor antifreeze and boiling mountains of slagged metal are what defined this planet.



Among that ancient debris, starships, vehicles, shuttles, equipment, tech, databanks, anything you could ask for. The humans exploited it all. Using their new heating tech, they were able to thaw out the frozen plateaus, using a¬† derelict mega freighter from ancient times as a base. The star system quickly became a wealth of knowledge for humans as they started to pick apart millions of ships and reverse engineer the tech. As we quickly realised, humans had this incredible aptitude for the task.



They suddenly gained leaps and bounds in their starship tech and colony tech, and quickly started outpacing the twelve galaxies at large. From being slightly behind the curve, to being so far ahead they became legitimately terrifying to be around.



Next, Lignumia. A so-called Paradise World. One of the big things about this planet is the fact it, by all definitions, is a paradise world, whose entire existence in some way has the capacity to support any and all life in extreme comfort. Its biggest export? A titanium-tough wood grown from trees that, when processed and hardened, makes the universe's best wood products. Can even be used for some starship hulls because of its strength and durability. Problem is, it can't be mass produced without damaging or outright destroying the planet's ecosphere.



Humans figured out a way to do that. Apparently they have this on their home planet. The conditions have to be precisely controlled but they found a way to grow massive forests of the wood, adjusting conditions so that local wildlife wouldn't use selective trees for nesting grounds. The trees free of wildlife would then be cut down and the healthy trees harvested for seeds to grow the next generation. This gave the humans an almost too easy monopoly on the wood production used in luxury yachts, and furniture, apparently.



Finally, at the time of this meeting, Circa and Cubus - homes of THE RING and THE CUBE. Circa and Cubus are the two strangest places in the universe, not just because of what they are, but how they are. Circa is a semi-circle ringworld that surrounds a central blue giant star. Inset into it like a gemstone in a ring, is Cubus, a planet sized super entity shaped like a cube. Cubus - appears to be some kind of sapient computer AI, and circa appears to be some kind of energy distribution array for it.



Chamberlain banged his gavel, getting us out of our daze of data staring.



""ENOUGH! I get it! I get it! So they passed! But why are they near THAT system? We didn't add that to the challenge quota! What are they doing at the CUBE?"" She bellowed angrily.



""No idea. Scouts say they are importing vast quantities of resources to the cube world and are mass producing huge quantities of infrastructure for some reason. They aren't telling us anything we don't already know. They're just saying 'eh, we can get it working again' and carrying on as if nothing was happening. Besides, the star system is in their borders so... I don't really see why they can't have it."" I replied in kind from my seat.



""Lets face it the humans, as brilliant as they are, are very simple creatures. If they get the CUBE working again they will probably just use it to make the perfect recipe for pizza or the best cup of coffee ever. We should know this by now."" The Councillor from the Suruuk said plainly.



We all nodded in agreement. ""Now as for what we need to do about their export situation, I think we nee-"" The Kalvake Councillor started talking, then mid-sentence, popped out of existence.



We all stared in wonder. The other two councillors stared in wonder then began to panic. Shortly after one of them stood up to run away, he too popped out of reality and vanished. The last one screamed and hyperventilated, shortly before she too, disappeared.



""What the hell was THAT!?"" I asked.



""What is going o-!""



The Chamberlain was cut off mid statement as she vanished from her podium. The metal surfaces started to glow. The room started to get bright. Then one by one, everyone present from janitorial staff to the high council popped out of existence.



The world went bright, like a light shining In my eyes, then I too popped out of existence. When my eyes opened, I was in a room, solid white, everything, floors, ceiling, walls, just a white expanse of empty nothing. Once I could feel my feet again, I stood up and looked around me.



""HELLO!?""



My voice echoed for eternity in this liminal space. Then an entity... No. A human, popped into existence in front of me. ""Heyo! You bellowed?""



""A human? What is this place? Who are you - why are we here?"" I yelled insistently.



""Welcome to Limbo Version Two. Here's the short version, you know THE CUBE right? Cubus and Circa? We fed Cubus all the data we got from Tenedium and fed it resources from all the places we had been to. Turns out Cubus wasn't a planet, it was God. And uhh‚Ä¶ Yeah. It asked us if we wanted to ascend. And we thought it meant something completely different, so we said 'Hell yeah!' and uhh‚Ä¶ yeah. So the universe was erased, and you are now here. Waiting to start your own universe as the next God of it.""



I blinked. I then slapped my face with my hand. ""Oh dear... You mean to tell me you thought GOD was doing something completely different? I'm going to guess allowing your 'short people' to grow slightly taller or something, or jump slightly higher so you could see on a ledge without a ladder."" I said.



""Well yeah, of course we thought he meant that. Ladders are so... troublesome. It's easier to just jump higher isn't it?""



I slapped my face again, a lot harder, leaving a palm-shaped mark. ""And you said 'yes' because it never occurred to you that 'ascension' didn't mean anything else? AND THEN YOU ACCIDENTALLY ASCENDED THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE TO GODHOOD!?""



The human sheepishly tucked his hand behind his neck and stared at the floor. ""Oops... Sorry...""



""You know what, never mind. I am part of godhood now. I shall create my own universe. And it shall have none of you crazy humans in it! Maybe we can ascend to godhood properly next time!"" I bellowed.



""Sorry..."" He kept apologetically shuffling and vanished.



And so I did. I created my own universe, exactly like the old one, without the crazy humans.



It lasted a really, REALLY long time... And it was really boring‚Ä¶

My¬†phone¬†immediately¬†vibrated.¬†It¬†was¬†from¬†Ethan:¬†

City¬†Hospital,¬†ER.¬†Come¬†quick.¬†

My¬†heart¬†pounding,¬†I¬†spun¬†around¬†and¬†fled¬†before¬†they¬†could¬†discover¬†me.¬†

Two¬†minutes¬†later,¬†however,¬†Ethan¬†retracted¬†the¬†message,¬†a¬†flicker of¬†what¬†seemed¬†like¬†regret.¬†

I¬†pretended¬†I¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†seen¬†anything¬†and¬†didn‚Äôt¬†reply.¬†

In¬†truth,¬†I¬†had seen¬†all¬†of¬†this¬†coming.¬†

While¬†Ethan¬†was¬†in¬†the¬†shower,¬†I¬†had¬†accidentally¬†discovered¬†an¬†encrypted¬†photo¬†album¬†on¬†his¬†phone¬†named¬†‚ÄúGame¬†Progress.‚Äù¬†

Inside¬†were¬†96¬†videos.¬†

Not¬†one¬†more,¬†not¬†one¬†less.¬†Exactly¬†the¬†number¬†of¬†times¬†I¬†had¬†been pranked.¬†

The¬†password¬†was¬†Sophia‚Äôs¬†birthday.¬†

He¬†had¬†once¬†lied¬†to¬†me,¬†saying¬†it¬†was¬†the¬†date¬†we¬†first¬†met.¬†

Instead,¬†he¬†was¬†at¬†Sophia‚Äôs¬†mansion,¬†celebrating¬†her¬†birthday,¬†and¬†didn‚Äôt¬†show¬†up¬†until¬†late¬†into¬†the¬†night.¬†

Ethan¬†carefully¬†wrapped¬†a¬†scarf¬†around¬†my¬†neck,¬†the¬†gesture¬†so¬†tender¬†it¬†felt¬†almost sacred.¬†

A¬†dull¬†ache¬†spread¬†through¬†my¬†heart¬†as¬†I¬†opened¬†my¬†messaging¬†app.¬†

Pinned¬†at¬†the¬†top¬†was¬†his¬†chat¬†with¬†Sophia,¬†where¬†he¬†reported¬†the¬†progress¬†of¬†his¬†pranks¬†daily,¬†a¬†dense¬†and¬†endless¬†scroll:¬†

15:36¬†

And¬†for¬†Ethan,¬†I¬†had¬†turned¬†down¬†every¬†opportunity¬†to¬†study¬†abroad,¬†choosing¬†to¬†stay¬†in¬†New¬†York.¬†

My¬†father¬†was¬†thrilled¬†to hear¬†my¬†words.¬†‚ÄúMy¬†dear¬†daughter,¬†you‚Äôve¬†finally¬†seen¬†the¬†light!‚Äù¬†

I¬†held¬†back¬†my¬†tears¬†and¬†managed¬†a¬†soft¬†‚ÄúMm.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDad,¬†when¬†I¬†leave,¬†help¬†me¬†stage¬†a¬†plane¬†crash.‚Äù¬†

Ethan¬†Carter¬†faked¬†amnesia¬†for¬†three¬†years¬†to¬†win¬†me¬†over.¬†

I¬†fell¬†for¬†it.¬†Completely.¬†

I¬†was¬†standing¬†outside his¬†door,¬†positive¬†pregnancy¬†test¬†in¬†my¬†hand.¬†

Then¬†I¬†heard¬†her¬†voice,¬†the¬†woman¬†who¬†always¬†hated¬†me.¬†

‚ÄúThank¬†you¬†for¬†this¬†little¬†amnesia¬†game.¬†99¬†pranks¬†on¬†Anna.‚Äù¬†

So,¬†I¬†died¬†in¬†a¬†plane¬†crash.¬†

They¬†say¬†he¬†went¬†mad,¬†tearing¬†through¬†the¬†burning¬†wreckage¬†himself.¬†

All¬†he¬†found¬†was¬†a single¬†ring.¬†

1¬†Chapter¬†1¬†

My¬†nails¬†dug¬†deep¬†into¬†my¬†palms.¬†

That¬†was¬†the¬†diamond¬†necklace¬†my¬†grandmother¬†had¬†left¬†me.¬†Ethan had¬†told¬†me¬†he‚Äôd¬†accidentally¬†lost¬†it¬†during¬†the¬†move.¬†

That¬†day,¬†I¬†searched¬†in¬†the¬†torrential¬†rain¬†for¬†seven¬†whole¬†hours¬†and¬†ended¬†up¬†with¬†a¬†104‚Äìdegree¬†fever,¬†

‚ÄúThe¬†best¬†one¬†was¬†the¬†day¬†of¬†her¬†thesis¬†defense!¬†Ethan¬†lied¬†and¬†said¬†he¬†was¬†drunk¬†at¬†a¬†bar¬†and¬†getting¬†jumped‚Äù¬†

I¬†bit¬†down¬†hard¬†on¬†my¬†lower¬†lip.¬†

That¬†time,¬†I¬†had¬†abandoned¬†the¬†graduation¬†defense¬†I¬†had¬†prepared¬†for¬†half¬†a¬†year¬†to¬†find¬†him,¬†and¬†the¬†consequence¬†was having¬†to¬†delay¬†my¬†graduation.¬†

My¬†phone¬†immediately¬†vibrated.¬†It¬†was¬†from¬†Ethan:¬†

City¬†Hospital,¬†ER.¬†Come¬†quick.¬†

My¬†heart¬†pounding,¬†I¬†spun¬†around¬†and¬†fled¬†before¬†they¬†could¬†discover¬†me.¬†

Two¬†minutes¬†later,¬†however,¬†Ethan¬†retracted¬†the¬†message,¬†a¬†flicker of¬†what¬†seemed¬†like¬†regret.¬†

I¬†pretended¬†I¬†hadn‚Äôt¬†seen¬†anything¬†and¬†didn‚Äôt¬†reply.¬†

In¬†truth,¬†I¬†had seen¬†all¬†of¬†this¬†coming.¬†

While¬†Ethan¬†was¬†in¬†the¬†shower,¬†I¬†had¬†accidentally¬†discovered¬†an¬†encrypted¬†photo¬†album¬†on¬†his¬†phone¬†named¬†‚ÄúGame¬†Progress.‚Äù¬†

Inside¬†were¬†96¬†videos.¬†

Not¬†one¬†more,¬†not¬†one¬†less.¬†Exactly¬†the¬†number¬†of¬†times¬†I¬†had¬†been pranked.¬†

The¬†password¬†was¬†Sophia‚Äôs¬†birthday.¬†

He¬†had¬†once¬†lied¬†to¬†me,¬†saying¬†it¬†was¬†the¬†date¬†we¬†first¬†met.¬†

On¬†that¬†day¬†last¬†year,¬†I¬†waited¬†for¬†him¬†in¬†the¬†heavy¬†snow¬†for¬†three¬†hours,¬†wanting¬†to¬†spend¬†Christmas¬†Eve¬†together.¬†

Instead,¬†he¬†was¬†at¬†Sophia‚Äôs¬†mansion,¬†celebrating¬†her¬†birthday,¬†and¬†didn‚Äôt¬†show¬†up¬†until¬†late¬†into¬†the¬†night.¬†

Ethan¬†carefully¬†wrapped¬†a¬†scarf¬†around¬†my¬†neck,¬†the¬†gesture¬†so¬†tender¬†it¬†felt¬†almost sacred.¬†

A¬†dull¬†ache¬†spread¬†through¬†my¬†heart¬†as¬†I¬†opened¬†my¬†messaging¬†app.¬†

Pinned¬†at¬†the¬†top¬†was¬†his¬†chat¬†with¬†Sophia,¬†where¬†he¬†reported¬†the¬†progress¬†of¬†his¬†pranks¬†daily,¬†a¬†dense¬†and¬†endless¬†scroll:¬†

Intentionally¬†told¬†her¬†the¬†wrong¬†time¬†for¬†her¬†competition,¬†two¬†hours¬†late.¬†The¬†way¬†she¬†sprinted¬†over¬†in¬†her¬†pajamas¬†was¬†hilarious.¬†

The¬†last¬†message¬†was¬†from¬†the¬†day¬†of¬†the¬†alumni¬†reunion.¬†

When¬†Sophia¬†‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù¬†knocked¬†over¬†a¬†cup¬†of¬†scalding¬†coffee,¬†Ethan¬†had¬†reflexively¬†shielded¬†me.¬†

I¬†dialed¬†my¬†father‚Äôs¬†number¬†and¬†told¬†him¬†I¬†wanted¬†to¬†move¬†to¬†Montreal¬†with¬†him.¬†

Ever¬†since¬†my¬†mother¬†passed¬†away¬†five¬†years¬†ago,¬†he¬†had¬†been¬†living¬†in¬†the¬†city¬†where¬†they¬†fell¬†in¬†love,¬†guarding¬†their¬†memories.¬†

And¬†for¬†Ethan,¬†I¬†had¬†turned¬†down¬†every¬†opportunity¬†to¬†study¬†abroad,¬†choosing¬†to¬†stay¬†in¬†New¬†York.¬†

I¬†once¬†thought¬†I¬†could¬†melt¬†his¬†icy¬†heart,¬†but¬†I¬†forgot¬†that¬†when¬†ice¬†melts,¬†all¬†that‚Äôs¬†left¬†is¬†a¬†bone‚Äìchilling¬†cold.¬†

My¬†all‚Äìconsuming¬†love¬†was¬†nothing¬†but¬†a¬†prank,¬†and¬†I¬†was¬†just¬†a¬†tool¬†for¬†him¬†to¬†pursue¬†his¬†one¬†true¬†love.¬†

My¬†father¬†was¬†thrilled¬†to hear¬†my¬†words.¬†‚ÄúMy¬†dear¬†daughter,¬†you‚Äôve¬†finally¬†seen¬†the¬†light!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDad,¬†when¬†I¬†leave,¬†help¬†me¬†stage¬†a¬†plane¬†crash.‚Äù¬†

Though¬†he¬†didn‚Äôt¬†understand,¬†he¬†still agreed.¬†

A¬†plane¬†crash.¬†That¬†would¬†be¬†my¬†final¬†gift¬†to¬†Ethan.¬†

The¬†name¬†Anna¬†Jenkins‚ÄìI¬†would¬†make¬†him¬†spend¬†a¬†lifetime¬†atoning¬†for¬†it.¬†

I¬†deleted¬†all¬†our¬†photos¬†together¬†from¬†my¬†phone.¬†While¬†packing¬†my¬†things¬†at¬†home,¬†a¬†leather‚Äìbound¬†diary¬†slipped¬†out¬†of¬†Ethan‚Äôs¬†safe.¬†

On¬†its¬†dark¬†green¬†cover¬†was¬†the¬†embossed phoenix¬†totem¬†from¬†the¬†game¬†Ashes¬†of¬†Empire‚Äìthe first¬†version¬†of¬†the¬†logo¬†I¬†had¬†designed¬†

No alert sound follows, just like it hasn't for the past 29 months. Nothing ever changes, not even the coffee maker ever breaks.

**The Setup**

It was 2 AM. I was finishing a campaign build for a client and, in my half-asleep haze, went to set the daily budget. The intended number: **$100/day.**  
  
What I actually typed: **$1/day.**

No double-check. No second thought. Just hit Save and shut the laptop like a pro who thought his work was flawless.

**The Next Morning Disaster Check**

Coffee in hand, I open the dashboard expecting to see the usual early traction. Instead, I see:

* **Impressions:** 14
* **Clicks:** 0
* **Spend:** $1 (of course)

Then came the email from the client: ***‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶is the campaign live?‚Äù***

That sinking feeling? Yeah, it hit like a truck.   
  
My brain instantly retraced the steps, and sure enough; there it was. Budget = $1/day. Rookie mistake dressed up as professional advertising.

**The Plot Twist**

Here‚Äôs the part I still can‚Äôt wrap my head around. Out of those 14 lonely impressions, **one person D'Md the client directly about a bulk order.**

Not a casual inquiry. Not a ‚Äúmaybe later.‚Äù A serious, qualified lead who wanted to purchase in volume.

In other words, my $1 mistake somehow stumbled its way into hyper-targeting the perfect prospect.

**The Aftermath**

Naturally, the client is now obsessed with this so-called **‚Äú$1 strategy.‚Äù** I‚Äôve heard everything from:

* *‚ÄúShould we scale this?‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúWhat if $1/day is the sweet spot?‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúCan you test this again?‚Äù*

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm sitting there trying to look like I meant to do this all along, when in reality, it was nothing more than sleep deprivation + sloppy budget entry.

**Key Takeaway (Accidental as it May Be)**

* **Even screw-ups have data in them.** That single D'M doesn‚Äôt mean $1/day is the new growth hack, but it does say something about how unpredictable reach can be.
* **Clients love a good story.** The ‚Äú$1 miracle lead‚Äù has now become part of how they tell *their* story, which oddly boosts trust.
* **Always triple-check budgets.** Sleepy brain + ad platform = chaos.

**Ending Note...**

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend $1 campaigns as a real strategy (unless you‚Äôre running micro-tests for fun). But it‚Äôs a reminder that sometimes even your worst mistakes can hand you results you never planned for.

And yes, I‚Äôm still pretending it was all part of my master plan.",7,1759143831.0,FacebookAds,4,1.0,False
1ntf0k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1ntf0k0/fixed_my_chaotic_periods_w_primal_queen/,Fixed my chaotic periods w/ Primal Queen,"My periods were so random I called it tampon roulette.

45 days. 23 days. 40 days. 31 days. Spent more on pregnancy tests than coffee (and I REALLY love coffee). Had emergency tampons stashed everywhere like a doomsday prepper.

**Already tried:** birth control (mood swings from hell), vitex (nothing), seed cycling (tasty but useless), acupuncture ($800 poorer), every supplement at Whole Foods (my pee was very expensive)

Stumbled into organ supplements while researching ancestral diets. Primal Queen caught my eye because it has reproductive organs (ovaries, uterus) not just liver like the others. Figured why not, already tried weirder things.

**The timeline that made me cry (happy tears):**

-Week 2: Felt weird, almost quit

-Day 34: Period showed up (normal was 45-60 days!)

1ntevtb,https://www.reddit.com/r/woocommerce_USA/comments/1ntevtb/top_ways_to_upsell_with_woocommerce_product_addons/,Top Ways to Upsell with WooCommerce Product Add-Ons,"https://preview.redd.it/qgog52n733sf1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3810a668d717938f274d9c3b449db45c674475cb

Upselling is one of the easiest ways to grow your WooCommerce store‚Äôs revenue without spending more on traffic. By presenting customers with premium upgrades, complementary products, or customization options at the right time, you can boost average order value (AOV) while actually improving the shopping experience.

With the [PH Product Add-Ons](https://www.pluginhive.com/product/woocommerce-product-addons/) for WooCommerce plugin, you can make this happen seamlessly. It lets you enhance product pages with extra services, personalization, and smart upsell opportunities all in one place.

**Why Use Product Add-Ons for Upselling?**

WooCommerce on its own is solid, but it doesn‚Äôt give you advanced personalization or easy upsell options. That‚Äôs where [Product Add-Ons](https://www.pluginhive.com/product/woocommerce-product-addons/) shine:

* Flexible fields (dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, file uploads, text inputs, etc.)
* Dynamic pricing (fixed fees, percentages, per-word, per-quantity, etc.)
* Conditional logic (show add-ons only when relevant)
* Reusable groups (apply the same upsells to multiple products)
* Clear price display (customers always see what they‚Äôre paying for)

Essentially, this plugin turns a basic WooCommerce store into a personalized, revenue-boosting shopping experience.

**Top Ways to Upsell with WooCommerce Product Add-Ons**

Here are some practical ways to use add-ons to increase order value:

**1.Offer Premium Upgrades**

Use radio buttons or dropdowns to let customers choose between standard and premium versions of a product.

Example: Coffee mug with ‚ÄúStandard Finish‚Äù or ‚ÄúPremium Gloss (+$5).‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/nltvh8k933sf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db21782d863eddfabdf2485cb35eda9f730307c1

Customers upgrade instantly without leaving the product page.

**2. Bundle Complementary Items**

With checkbox fields, you can showcase add-ons like¬†[gift wrapping](https://www.pluginhive.com/woocommerce-product-addon-to-offer-gift-wrapping/), product protection, or accessories.

Example: Jewellery store offering ‚ÄúGift Box (+$5)‚Äù or ‚ÄúExtended Warranty (+$10).‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/nu8vehhb33sf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8164b53d09698a02ea908e2bd4cddaebc1c7c1a

Small, meaningful add-ons that boost AOV.

**3. Charge for Customizations**

Add text fields, colour pickers, or file uploads to offer¬†[personalization](https://www.pluginhive.com/woocommerce-engraved-product-personalization/). Customers love paying extra for custom touches.

Example: Clothing store upselling ‚ÄúCustom Embroidery (+$8)‚Äù or logo printing.

https://preview.redd.it/58yz04qo33sf1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ccd16e0d18701f2f3cac126015731c7cb276a31

Personalization = emotional value = higher willingness to pay.

**4. Use Conditional Add-Ons**

The plugin‚Äôs conditional logic lets you show add-ons only when relevant.

Example: If ‚ÄúGift Wrap‚Äù is selected, show ‚ÄúChoose Wrapping Paper‚Äù or ‚ÄúUpload Your Own Design.

https://preview.redd.it/7h9mjdjz33sf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53d55774c3d03af088008398b6873c653981daaa

https://preview.redd.it/67c68vls33sf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ae71de141268751969c14773f448f231a0fe114

Keeps upselling natural instead of overwhelming.

**5. Create Bundled / Time-Sensitive Offers**

With addon groups, you can combine multiple extras into a single upsell package.

Example: Electronics store offering a ‚ÄúPremium Bundle: Fast Shipping + Warranty + Screen Protector (+$20).‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/d402j2la43sf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d4e4723cbfed5e514d84911b966119484fe9a8f

Add urgency by marking it as a limited-time deal.

**6. Upsell with Dynamic Pricing**

The Addon supports dynamic pricing, meaning you can increase add-on costs based on quantity or input length.

Example: Bakery charging ‚Äú$1 per word‚Äù for cake messages or offering tiered cupcake personalization deals.

https://i.redd.it/bfaopk6k33sf1.gif

Incentivizes customers to buy more while paying extra.

**Real-World Example: Upselling in Action**

Imagine you run a WooCommerce store selling custom mugs and gifts. Customers expect personalization, upgrades, and bundles, but managing all that manually is messy.

With [PH Product Add-Ons](https://www.pluginhive.com/product/woocommerce-product-addons/):

* Customers type in names, messages, or upload designs directly on the product page.
* You upsell premium finishes, gift wrapping, or accessories.
* Conditional add-ons keep things simple (like showing greeting card options only if ‚ÄúGift Wrap‚Äù is chosen).
* Reusable add-ons save time when applying across multiple categories.

Results: Customers get a tailored shopping experience, and you get a steady boost in revenue.

**Best Practices for Maximizing Upsells**

* Offer relevant options only (don‚Äôt upsell random products).
* Keep it simple (3‚Äì5 high-value add-ons is ideal).
* Make it interactive (colours, uploads, custom text).
* Track performance and refine (drop what doesn‚Äôt work).
* Focus on value, not pressure (upsells should feel helpful).

**Final Thoughts**

Upselling with product add-ons is an easy way to grow your WooCommerce store and give customers a better shopping experience. Offering upgrades, personalization, or bundles can boost sales and make your products feel more valuable.

Both of us for modeling since we have agency, flight 3,5 hours distance. The week before I was at my hometown. Then I went sick. Got healthy again. But I was so anxious about the trip. I keep imaging I will forget my passport or something else important. Oversleep so I loose my flight or something happening when Im there. Another factor is that my hometown is a remoted place. I used insurance so I got money back for the flight. Stayed one more week just to relax. Started to feel terrible. Deceided I wanted to go but the time went to short for the agency so it was pointless. I have been to this place before. So I went super miserable the rest of my holiday. Then my coworker friend told me I can join her to her country wich is only 2 hours flight. Also early flight. I didnt dare to buy ticket. I woke up 4 today, in case. I packed yesterday. Only 4 days trip. But I was a week today, I got up, showered, but faced I might have been to late. I would arrive 1 hour before departure, I think it would have worked out, but I didnt take the chance to spend money like that. Instead of going back to sleep I went out to have a coffee and breakfeast. But now I want to send her a message and ask if I can come tomorrow. Or take a trip on my own. I cant find peace. I managed to get up, but not go catch the train to airport. Im tired of ending up not going and I dont know why I became like this. Im just miserable about myself. Im scared to go abroad, because I feel like a target. Or prices on trains increasing a lot. Im not even poor. I also have this strange thing, Im satisfied of that one moment I deceide to not, I can enjoy just staying in my city, but few minutes later I just feel terrible. But staying makes me keep being super restless. No peace.

Im still here, wondering what to do this week. Say to my boss that I want to skipt the rest of my holiday, just book a flight somewhere (but we know it might be the same problem again). 
Send a message to my friend if its ok to come tomorrow.

Most of them ended up in the trash, and every time I changed my phone number or LinkedIn, I had to reprint.

Last year, I switched to a digital business card through a startup called [Swopi](https://shop.swopi.co/). Honestly, it changed everything about the way I network:

* **One card for life.** I carry a single Swopi NFC/QR card, and it instantly shares my profile.
* **Dynamic updates.** If I change jobs or phone numbers, I just update my Swopi profile once...no more reprints.
* **Eco-friendly.** No paper waste, no boxes of unused cards.
* **Better results.** My callback rates roughly tripled because people actually save my contact to their phone.
* **Business cards always with me.** If I forget the card (happens), I simply pull up my phone with Swopi app and share my card with QR code on the phone display. 

Now I don‚Äôt even think about printing cards anymore. Swopi works at conferences, sales meetings, even random coffee shop conversations.

Every weekend my husband (42M) and I (40F) like to grab a cup of coffee at a cafe near our home and walk a loop around the adjacent lake. It's early so we usually encounter the walker/jogger crowd so it's not creepy and desolate but still peaceful. :)

ANYWAY, this past weekend we were doing our usual, walking the path, when I realized this woman was walking on a collision course toward us. We were walking on the right side of the path so she'd be on the left side from her perspective, walking directly toward us. I am not even sure which of us was correct in that respect but, either way, a collision was imminent. My husband was either on his phone or looking at something else (I'm not sure) and didn't notice anything happening. I wrapped my arm around his waist and pulled him toward me and she passed by him, just barely. He didn't even realize what happened until I told him about it.

He started in with ""well what would she have done if I didn't move? I should have just stood my ground and pretended to be on my phone, oblivious. She'd have to go around."" and so on. I said ""I don't know what she would have done, I'm just glad we didn't collide."" and I thought that was it because we continued walking but about 20-30 seconds later he said again that he should have just stood there, what would she have done, really. I said I don't know. Quiet again for half a minute or so and he started again. At that point I said ""Does the whole walk have to be about that stupid lady?!"" kind of harsh. He said he should be able to talk to me about things that frustrate him. I said I don't understand why he gets so hung up on that kind of thing, it was a 2 second interaction.

We were both silent the rest of the walk and then went home. Later he said he didn't want us to be fighting but he felt unsupported and felt like I should have listened and been there for him. Then he went for a run and we agreed to drop it, and we have. It's just that normally we each present our side and talk it out and come to agreement so I'm still slightly irritated.

fwiw, my side is that I find it irritating that he will complain about a small problem the entire time we're doing whatever it is so that the entire thing is about the problem. For example, say someone cut us in line waiting for a table at a restaurant. He'll talk about that the entire meal. And the lake is this thing we do to get fresh air and release anxiety and we're only going to be there for a little while. So maybe I was harsh in my delivery but that's where it was coming from.

I get that he only talked about it for a few minutes before I cut him off. I get that he struggles (as do I) with anxiety and frustration and rumination. I am largely very supportive when it comes to being a listening ear.

Pretty pls!,"Hello everyone :) I am posting in this group again because on my last post, i had some really helpful suggestions (thank you!). Now i am at my finalising stage and believe i have created a decent itinerary even though i know it is a little jam packed. We have hired a 4x4 and we will be here during the second week of October (yay exciting)

**Notes & questions:**

1) I am a little sad we are not going to make it to Stuglagil Canyon - so if you find anywhere i can/should reduce something so i can make it there, let me know. I highly doubt it, as i believe the only way to make it there is by adding a day or 2 to our trip which we cant do :( 

2) The lagoons aren't booked yet - i am in two minds on if its packing too much into the days or if i should just choose one (i cant even decide that). Which one would you do?

3) The areas we are staying in are:  
Reykjavik (2 nights)  
Vik (2 nights)  
Jokulslaron (2 nights)  
Hella (1 night)   
Total of 7 days because the first day is a write off - we land late afternoon/night.

4) For day 2 and 3, i have separate itineraries breaking down where to go - i have attached a pic for this too. I am not going to lie, i input the places that interested us and got Chat GPT to help us plan a route. Let me know if it sounds ridiculous. Ps i think i am going to remove a few things from Chat GPT's day 3 route.

5) Braud & Co is something i have seen everywhere on social media so i do want to try it. Oh and Black Crust pizza. Sorry if this is really touristy of me, but i cant help but want to try these places after people speaking highly of them.

6) Where it says ""colourful park"", its just a prompt to remember where we are going as i recently saw the national park with beautiful red's and orange autumn colours on a facebook post - dont judge, as this could have been photoshopped and i fell for it :P

7) The buggy tour with Katla Track on day 4 goes for 3 hours - so we will be done by 12.30pm.

8) The tour with Local Guide on day 6 is for about 5 hours - so we will be done by 2.30pm approx.

9) I have bookmarked websites [umferdin.is](http://umferdin.is), [road.is](http://road.is), [vedur.is](http://vedur.is) and [safe.is](http://safe.is) to assist with the weather, road closures and safety alerts (i am actually really scared after reading some posts here). While i will be checking these frequently, can you please let me know if any of these roads on these routes in my itinerary are ones that frequently close - i.e ring road (route 1) is known for being quite dangerous for driving or the road is constantly closed. I guess im asking not only for our safety, but to have some back up plans on where to go/what to do. These 2 tours i have booked have a 48 cancellation policy too, so i can try and be as prepped possible -- yes i know the iceland weather can have a mind of its own and i am ready for any unfortunate last min cancellations.

10) I think i have blabbed on enough now - i have attached a pic of the itinerary. Lastly, please be nice to me - for all i know this itinerary could be crap as no matter how confident i am with it :) Thank you!

*A heavy metal fan discovers the soul of American Country music while navigating love, illegal work, and identity in the wild heart of Wyoming.*

By Brent Antonson  
March 7, 2025 ‚Äî 5 min read

In 1994, a girlfriend from Saskatchewan‚Äîwhere the wind is strong and the beer is warm‚Äîintroduced me to American Country music. I was a Canadian road hound, obsessed with Metallica and Iron Maiden, convinced country music was just pickup trucks and heartbreak on repeat.

But over a few weeks, the genre cracked me wide open. What I once mocked as twangy wallpaper turned out to be rich with storytelling, soul, wit, and longing. Country music had *narrative*. It had *teeth*. It had the kind of raw, lived-in truth that heavy metal only screamed about. And once it hooked me, I didn‚Äôt let go.

Two years later, I was living in a $23-a-night motel in Laramie, Wyoming, working illegally at a gas station and wrenching under cars for $4 an hour. My girlfriend passed on under-the-table waitress work, worried about getting deported. I, on the other hand, couldn‚Äôt imagine being forced out of the country I‚Äôd adopted like a second skin. I‚Äôd driven all 48 lower states. I knew America better than most Americans.

And I was *free*. Broke, tired, uncertain‚Äîbut free.

One night, after a shift in ‚ÄúOld Blue‚Äù‚Äîa Dodge pickup with a black body and a single blue door‚ÄîI came back to the motel and found she‚Äôd spent $60 of our money on a coffee maker. My paycheck was $40. Something snapped. Not in anger, but in clarity. My version of love was drifting into the rearview.

That‚Äôs when I met the cowboys. At a local bar, six of them‚Äîreal-deal cowboys‚Äîasked me to help them drive 100 head of cattle to Denver over six weeks. I hadn‚Äôt been on a horse in years. It would‚Äôve changed my life. But when I asked her if I could go, she said what she always said: *‚ÄúAbsolutely not.‚Äù*

Eventually we moved in with Jerry, the gas station owner, a man whose fascination with firearms bordered on biblical. My girlfriend hated it‚Äîhated the guns, hated the house, hated the job. But I loved it. I shoveled snow for the locals. I pumped gas with pride. I was *alive*. If I‚Äôd done the same thing in Canada, I‚Äôd have been suicidal. In Wyoming, it was freedom. Any road could be the next chapter.

When things fell apart, I took my father‚Äôs offer and flew to Estonia, newly freed from Soviet rule. My girlfriend went home. I spent six months driving buses for Christian missionaries. They preached the Gospel. I played cassette tapes‚ÄîOzzy, GNR, and one odd addition: Garth Brooks.

One night, during a snowstorm, alone in the van, I played ‚ÄúMuch Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old).‚Äù And that‚Äôs when it happened. Garth sang:  
*‚Äú...a worn-out tape of Chris LeDoux‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Wait‚Äî*who the hell was Chris LeDoux*?

Nobody I knew had heard of him. Not in Wyoming, not in Oklahoma, not even Nashville. And yet here was this *rodeo champion* who moonlighted as a country musician. Not the other way around. He wasn‚Äôt made by Nashville. He *made himself*. Bon Jovi even cut a track with him. I downloaded everything I could. The music? Pure dirt, sweat, and poetry.

An eight-second bull ride‚Äîthat desperate, glorious attempt to stay mounted before the crash‚Äîbecame a metaphor. Not just for rodeo, but for life. It‚Äôs all eight seconds. Hold on, get thrown, get up, ride again.

Chris LeDoux would die young, taken by cancer. But in a frozen van outside Tallinn, Estonia, Garth gave me a gift: the song that led me to LeDoux. A single lyric that steered me toward the cowboy spirit, even while others preached salvation in the back rows of the van.

So here‚Äôs to the unsung legends. To the cowboy poets who ride the line between freedom and oblivion. And to Garth‚Äîfor writing a line that found me, halfway across the world, in a snowstorm, still trying to figure out what home really meant.",1,1759142827.0,WRXingaround,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to make an updated post about the Discord server. I will be online on Reddit with my chat request open till Friday, and then I'm going to go away for a while.

However, I thought I would share some updates since my last post that I deleted, and I thought I should address some new updates about myself and the Discord server.

Here is the Discord server invite link; however, this link doesn't need to be clicked right away because you're interested right away. You should check the first pinned posts for a further explanation of the Discord server's rules than what the Disboard social link can provide on my Reddit profile. 

https://discord.com/invite/ZQNkZaHeps

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha. 

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety. 

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me. 

Which I should also state, while I understand that the format seems confusing when I say I'm looking for friendship and other connections? I just can't be honest if I can expose my heart to someone right now, right away, and I can't say that's off the table right now. I opened my heart this month actually, simply and truthfully honest with the Redditors reading this. I'm just not in the mood to open my heart again; I just want to be friends, and if the connection builds, then that's not off the table. I'm just being honest with the Redditors here.

I've other ideas that might work for the Discord server and for people's creative outlets. 

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's spooky season and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.

Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?' 

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety. 

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary. 

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing. 

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night. 

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

With friends as well, maybe it's just me being a weirdo autistic woman, but I think it's cute to pinch your friends' energy drinks if your friends drink energy drinks? I just think that is cute, and if you can't tell by the few posts I've made here, I'm VERY autistic, and I know I am, haha. 

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile. 

That's also what I imply when I state that, given that, I'm just chilling/vibing inside the Discord server, tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break. 

However, with that being stated, I hope people can feel safe and relaxed in a stress-free Discord server where the people that are very introverted and have social anxiety have a toxic-free place to be themselves/chat with others when the vibe/mood is right for their liking. With the hopes of the cute animal pictures/videos of pets, or whatever backyard birds are outside, if anyone has any memes that correspond to the Discord server, it could help someone crack a smile through the darkness, and then that is good enough for me, and I would feel a sense of relief/enjoyment within myself if that goal were to happen.

I don't know, yeah, how many people vibe with this; however, wouldn't it be cute as friends to match the Sleep Token sticker and Lorna Shore sticker on our phone cases? I think that is adorable/cute, simply and truthfully. I would hopefully one day/this could maybe and might happen to match a lot of Sleep Token and Lorna Shore stickers with my online friends; that would be cool/awesome.

As a small but not insignificant preamble I had a seizure caused by a low blood sugar ( I am type 1 diabetic). This really fucked with my body for a few days and caused some general anxiety along with memory loss. 
My roommate is significantly younger than me but we enjoy each others company and I hope I have always provided a space for her to mature and grow. I learned recently she went through my room while I was not at home and came across a bunch of dime bags. I had just ordered a bunch of charms for a bracelet and they had come individually packaged in said bags. In finding these she immediately assumed I was abusing drugs-specifically cocaine- which everyone in my life knows that as a young adult I socially dabbled but I have long outgrown that lifestyle.  
Instead of approaching me with the concern she went to my friends and my boyfriend expressing anger and  attention for immediate intervention. My boyfriend and best friends immediately reached out to me in concern and confusion. 
Now it seems my roommate had gone off the rails with this drug abuse assumption. I recently proposed the idea that I‚Äôd like to live alone - not anything against her just personal preference- and she did not take it well. I feel this why things got worse. She sent my peers photos of these empty plastic bags scattered all around the house and on the floor, accusing me of leaving them there after partaking. She‚Äôs also stuck to a story that I leave large amounts of cocaine on our coffee table and I am ‚Äútoo social to not be addicted to drugs‚Äù. She‚Äôs reached out to my family and everyone close to me in a rather maniacal way and proposed the event of my memory loss from my seizure to be why I can‚Äôt take accountability or remember my actions. Also keeping in mind she never approached or talked with me first. All the close people in my life at first expressed concern but obviously there are no factors to back up her lies. Yet I‚Äôm still stuck in this sickening feeling that she‚Äôs created this narrative for me and who‚Äôs to believe the so called ‚Äú drug addict‚Äù. I deeply appreciate the support everyone has given me but I‚Äôm starting to feel as if I‚Äôm spiralling and my peers are questioning what is true.

1ntekhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Critical_Video_4609/comments/1ntekhi/how_to_take_calcium_supplements_for_best/,How to Take Calcium Supplements for Best Absorption,"Calcium is one of the most important minerals for our body. It supports strong bones, healthy teeth, and proper muscle function. Many people take calcium supplements, but the real question is‚Äîare you getting the maximum benefit? The way and time you take your supplement can affect how well your body absorbs it. Let‚Äôs look at some simple tips to make your calcium supplement more effective.

**1. Choose the Right Type of Calcium**

Not all calcium supplements are the same. The two main forms are:

* **Calcium carbonate** ‚Äì best absorbed when taken with food.
* **Calcium citrate** ‚Äì can be taken with or without food, easier to digest for people with low stomach acid.

Knowing which type you have helps you plan when and how to take it.

**2. Take Small Doses, Not All at Once**

Your body absorbs calcium better in smaller amounts. The general rule is **no more than 500‚Äì600 mg at a time**. If your daily dose is higher, split it into two or three smaller doses throughout the day.

**3. Pair with Vitamin D**

Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium more efficiently. Many supplements already contain vitamin D, but if yours doesn‚Äôt, try to get some sunlight exposure or include vitamin D‚Äìrich foods in your diet.

**4. Avoid Certain Foods and Drinks at the Same Time**

Some foods and beverages reduce calcium absorption. It‚Äôs best to avoid taking your supplement with:

* Coffee or tea (caffeine reduces absorption)
* Foods high in oxalates (like spinach)
* High-sodium foods (increase calcium loss in urine)

Instead, take calcium with a balanced meal for better absorption.

**5. Don‚Äôt Forget Consistency**

Like most nutrients, calcium works best when taken regularly. Make it a part of your daily routine. You can set a reminder or link it with another habit, like brushing your teeth in the morning or having dinner at night.

# Conclusion

Taking calcium supplements the right way ensures your body gets the maximum benefit. Choose the right type, take smaller doses, pair with vitamin D, and avoid absorption blockers. Most importantly, be consistent. Strong bones and better health come from smart habits‚Äîstart today!",1,1759142266.0,u_Critical_Video_4609,0,1.0,False

I've bundled all of my self-made subliminals and my playlist just to test it. (60 subs) I went up to 100+

Here's what I experienced:

Day 1 - At first I started having body shakes as it was too much for my body to handle. I added hand and feet beauty subliminals to test if I am gonna felt tingles and I did. I also tried to watch my German lessons but I couldn't keep up much. The first day went okey but when I woke up after listening 8 hours at night I felt like I haven't slept at all. I did not check my results.

Day 2 - It was a lil bit easier but messier where I constantly had a headache and random body pains. I felt my eyes burning, my tooth hurting, I felt like I was lost in the subliminal and I could not react on time to things.  
I still did not check my results except my eye color. I also struggled to hit my daily 10k steps goal.

Day 3 - Today - Where I am ending my bundling experience due to not being able to study German for 3 days, wanting to vomit (feeling sick) and feeling extremely tired from subliminals. Did I experience a glow up? I look like I've been in a roller coaster for 24 hours while I could not study anything. My room looks messy and I probably need 5 cups of coffee.

In conclusion I did not experience results or seen any good sides of it except I felt like I was slapped by my subliminals and I do not recommend anyone to bundle 60 subliminals like I did.

Stay safe and probably the safest way to manifest is the easiest one. Our subconscious is unlimited but our bodies cannot keep up with our subconscious mind which results as feeling extremely drained. I am glad it did not trigger my depression and I am ending this to protect my mental health because I feel like it's getting riskier.

Ye I ain't doing this sh\*t again. 2x or 1x is the best way to listen that's it.

I also do not see any changes. I still wanted to give it a try because it sounded like it's a big deal but nope. Keep in mind this is my experience if it works for you it works.

Hey, friends! üôå

Ever feel like life‚Äôs moving at light speed while you‚Äôre still stuck in neutral? Yeah, me too. With AI shaping our futures faster than we can say ""machine learning,"" it‚Äôs clear: **if we don‚Äôt upskill, we‚Äôre gonna get left in the dust**. üöÄ

Let‚Äôs face it, there‚Äôs a *ton* of opportunities out there, and we've got to arm ourselves with the right skills. Here‚Äôs why you should start investing in your future NOW, or risk waving goodbye to your AI earnings... üò±

### Why Upskilling is a Game-Changer

- **Stay Relevant**: Industries are changing. Have you seen how quickly AI is being adopted in everything from marketing to healthcare? Keeping up means knowing what‚Äôs current.
- **Boost Earnings**: A little investment in education can pay off big time. Studies show that those who learn new skills often see a boost in their paycheck. üí∞
- **Control Your Future**: The more you know, the more opportunities you can create for yourself. Want to transition to a new career? Upskilling gives you that power!

Imagine being the go-to AI guru in your team‚Äîeveryone looking to you for insights. Pretty sweet, right? üí™

### What You Can Do Right Now

Okay, but where do you even start? Here‚Äôs a simple action plan you can follow:

1. **Identify Gaps**: What skills are in demand in your field? Chat with peers, browse job boards. *What are companies looking for?*
2. **Pick a Course**: There‚Äôs a wealth of resources out there! Check out this awesome program I stumbled upon (https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). Seriously, it‚Äôs like finding gold! üíé
3. **Set Time Aside**: Carve out a little ‚Äòyou-time‚Äô each day or week. Maybe even make a weekly coffee date with yourself to learn something new.
4. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Don‚Äôt just coast through the courses. Apply what you learn‚Äîtackle small projects, collaborate with friends, or even post your experiences! You‚Äôll be amazed at how much you can grow. üå±

### A Little Humor to Lighten the Mood 

If you don‚Äôt start learning today, tomorrow you might find yourself at a family dinner, being asked for tech advice by your grandma‚Ä¶ and she‚Äôs using a flip phone! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Remember

We‚Äôre all on this wild ride together, and the growth mindset is key. Challenge yourself and embrace the chaos that comes with new learning. **Because if you don‚Äôt evolve, you may very well end up nostalgic for the days when your biggest concern was how to make your phone battery last.**

So, let's chat ‚Äî what skills are you thinking about tackling? What‚Äôs holding you back? Let‚Äôs keep this convo flowing and inspire one another to step up our game! üèÜ",1,1759142166.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

But I need some advice. The more I look at the parrot the more I like it, but I don't know if bigger plushies are seen as too 'much'?

I've interrailed through Sweden before, so I'm familiar with how it works there, but this will be my first time doing it in Norway.

- Apparently, Norwegian trains don't have a true first class but a ""comfort"" area where there's free coffee and stuff. Is this true for both the major operators (Vy and SJ) and if so, what exactly does that area entail?

- I will probably be travelling on a first class pass. I believe I read in some forum that this entitles you to a free reservation in the comfort area. Can anybody confirm this?

- My main planned journeys into/in/out of Norway are G√∂teborg - Oslo, Oslo - Trondheim and Trondheim - Storlien.

If you do, I would love to get to know you. I'm going to go away for a while and this is where I'll be chilling if you would like to chat.","
I just wanted to make an updated post about the Discord server. I will be online on Reddit with my chat request open till Friday, and then I'm going to go away for a while.

However, I thought I would share some updates since my last post that I deleted, and I thought I should address some new updates about myself and the Discord server.

Here is the Discord server invite link; however, this link doesn't need to be clicked right away because you're interested right away. You should check the first pinned posts for a further explanation of the Discord server's rules than what the Disboard social link can provide on my Reddit profile. 

https://discord.com/invite/ZQNkZaHeps

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLIg-7ZIdT4WaAAD4629BXLVXrJQG5tf

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha. 

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety. 

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me. 

Which I should also state, while I understand that the format seems confusing when I say I'm looking for friendship and other connections? I just can't be honest if I can expose my heart to someone right now, right away, and I can't say that's off the table right now. I opened my heart this month actually, simply and truthfully honest with the Redditors reading this. I'm just not in the mood to open my heart again; I just want to be friends, and if the connection builds, then that's not off the table. I'm just being honest with the Redditors here.

I've other ideas that might work for the Discord server and for people's creative outlets. 

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's spooky season and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.

Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?' 

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety. 

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary. 

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing. 

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night. 

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

With friends as well, maybe it's just me being a weirdo autistic woman, but I think it's cute to pinch your friends' energy drinks if your friends drink energy drinks? I just think that is cute, and if you can't tell by the few posts I've made here, I'm VERY autistic, and I know I am, haha. 

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile. 

That's also what I imply when I state that, given that, I'm just chilling/vibing inside the Discord server, tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break. 

However, with that being stated, I hope people can feel safe and relaxed in a stress-free Discord server where the people that are very introverted and have social anxiety have a toxic-free place to be themselves/chat with others when the vibe/mood is right for their liking. With the hopes of the cute animal pictures/videos of pets, or whatever backyard birds are outside, if anyone has any memes that correspond to the Discord server, it could help someone crack a smile through the darkness, and then that is good enough for me, and I would feel a sense of relief/enjoyment within myself if that goal were to happen.

I don't know, yeah, how many people vibe with this; however, wouldn't it be cute as friends to match the Sleep Token sticker and Lorna Shore sticker on our phone cases? I think that is adorable/cute, simply and truthfully. I would hopefully one day/this could maybe and might happen to match a lot of Sleep Token and Lorna Shore stickers with my online friends; that would be cool/awesome.

However, I'm off to go play some Skyrim at 5 something a.m.

I‚Äôm a young writer who just saw a long-time dream turn into reality. My very first book, In the Asking, I Changed, is finally out. It‚Äôs a journey through psychology, philosophy, and those restless questions that never quite leave us. The kind of questions that keep you awake at night, make your coffee go cold, or quietly change the direction of your life.

This book is personal, but it‚Äôs also for anyone who‚Äôs ever wondered about who they are, what they‚Äôre chasing, or why the act of questioning itself can transform us.

I put together a short trailer here: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPLUCyVE1zm/?igsh=ZjQwcmJvdXU0M3Bz 

If it resonates, I‚Äôd be truly grateful if you‚Äôd check it out and maybe even get a copy. As a first-time author still finding her way, every reader means the world.",2,1759141554.0,Indiabooks,0,1.0,False

I just wanted to make an updated post about the Discord server. I will be online on Reddit with my chat request open till Friday, and then I'm going to go away for a while.

However, I thought I would share some updates since my last post that I deleted, and I thought I should address some new updates about myself and the Discord server.

Here is the Discord server invite link; however, this link doesn't need to be clicked right away because you're interested right away. You should check the first pinned posts for a further explanation of the Discord server's rules than what the Disboard social link can provide on my Reddit profile.

You just might think, ""You really think this Discord server is okay for people with social anxiety with 60 people in the Discord server"" (I'm sure the Discord server will either rise or decrease when I say this, haha.) However, what makes you think 60 people in the Discord server are chatting up a storm? That's so inaccurately false, haha. 

Yeah, well, this Discord server is heavily music-based, which means people with social anxiety will only check the notifications for the hashtags that are related to the music hashtags and will only text in the general text when the energy/vibes are right. Which is what is happening in the Discord server; nobody barely texts in the general chat hashtags, and obviously that makes sense, it being a Discord server that is heavily catering to the NEETs, introverts, and people with social anxiety. 

That's how I am as well; I chat when I feel the energy, I'm feeling a break from the social anxiety, and I'm feeling chatty. I will say, speaking of social anxiety, introduction posts aren't required to chat/post amongst the Discord server members. However, if you feel the need to make an introduction post, then you can do that by doing what you normally post as an introduction post, as you would here on this subreddit.

Speaking of social anxiety, we're looking to help cure some of the sadness with cute cat pictures. Who here has cat pictures or cat videos that can help with the pet hashtag on the Discord server? If you don't have cats, then whatever pets you have or own work; that even includes if you have a pet gecko or salamander. You can also add to the spook factor if you get a lot of crows or ravens in your backyard for added vibes/coolness to the Discord server as well. I'm just trying to make this a non-toxic space for all and also trying to make friends that vibe with me. 

Which I should also state, while I understand that the format seems confusing when I say I'm looking for friendship and other connections? I just can't be honest if I can expose my heart to someone right now, right away, and I can't say that's off the table right now. I opened my heart this month actually, simply and truthfully honest with the Redditors reading this. I'm just not in the mood to open my heart again; I just want to be friends, and if the connection builds, then that's not off the table. I'm just being honest with the Redditors here.

I've other ideas that might work for the Discord server and for people's creative outlets. 

Examples could be.

Jerry handmade inspired bracelets but without using the Sleep Token logo! However, we do have safety measures for everyone to follow to feel safe. Redditors that join this Discord server for this purpose must be able to show proof either by a piece of paper of their PayPal and the item next to the item or, if the person doesn't have proof of reviews from a retail website where you can sell your goods, by the item itself.

An example of that would be eBay reviews. I'm also trying to see if I can have a friend help me with getting animated flamingo stickers for Sleep Token vibes, and I will have to see what can be done for Lorna Shore. I'm not certain what animated emotes can be used for Lorna Shore. Maybe someone could chime in with ideas!

I'm also allowing people in the introduction post to post if they feel comfortable posting about looking for people to play video games with. I know Discord automatically has a connection feature for Steam and PlayStation profiles, but that doesn't help others/give a cue to Discord users to know if you want people to play with you or not.

I also don't think Nintendo will be interested in allowing a Discord connection option, which sucks.

Who knows, maybe it's a copyright issue with Nintendo why there can't be a Discord connection option to share your Nintendo code for others to add; that's such a shame/bummer!

Which I wanted to bring up about gaming, since it's spooky season and Redditors are probably wondering. Since my last posts, it's obvious enough that I'm seeking an 85 percent connection and spent the majority of that time online only rather than in person because of personal conflicts with the living conditions that I'm in right now that will change in a year or possibly in two years, and you can read more in the second pinned post, as that would explain it in more detail than bringing this post out way longer than it is right now haha. However, let's talk about what I'm talking about with friends and doing something on the arrival of Halloween.

Obviously, microphones can be muted; of course, I will mute mine. I can tell you right now I can't multitask, as you've gathered from my previous posts that were previously deleted after being uploaded for a while. I can't multitask, and I get easily distracted if I try multitasking. I also don't think anybody wants to hear their friend go, 'Uh...wait, let me open a browser tab, and let me look this up, and oh wait, I need to go back on what my friend said. What was that?' 

Uh...then figures out what to say afterwards, while getting back on track, which is no thanks, and I don't expect anyone to get on the microphone anyways with social anxiety. 

However, I'm looking to see if a friend on Halloween could start a screen share on Discord or even start a YouTube stream with either a Silent Hill game or a Devil May Cry game, and as is obviously no surprise, my other favorite franchise is SEGA, and I mean, how obvious is that? It would be nice to sip on a coffee and text about whatever you feel like texting about, and we don't have to text about every single cutscene that hits the game unless you find that completely necessary. 

We don't really have to do that, and I don't find that necessary unless the other person thinks that's necessary. We can just get virtually cozy and text about whatever while I enjoy the stream, and yeah, we can both agree on a game that you would enjoy double screen sharing. 

We could even take a break, screen share on Discord my YT music shuffle playlist that I created, and just relax on Discord listening to music for an hour or longer than an hour, maybe an hour and a half, or maybe music/texting about whatever you feel like the topic should be for the evening/night. 

That would be fine, and also for game streams. I normally enjoy watching for three or four hours on screen share or YT stream, whereas music playlist shuffle screen sharing with my friends for an hour or near/close to an hour and a half is perfect because I end up dozing off and falling asleep because I'm so relaxed, LMFAO. My ex-friend/ex-partner did this with me until he didn't like doing that with me anymore, and yeah, we used to do this a lot, and this is something that almost happened once. I was so relaxed with the shuffle playlist stream/chatting away that I ended up getting very sleepy/tired and dozed off for a few minutes, haha.

With friends as well, maybe it's just me being a weirdo autistic woman, but I think it's cute to pinch your friends' energy drinks if your friends drink energy drinks? I just think that is cute, and if you can't tell by the few posts I've made here, I'm VERY autistic, and I know I am, haha. 

The friends that I've curiously asked how autistic I sound in the past in text messages have always replied, ""You sound very autistic, and it's very noticeable in your text messages."" However, I do understand how mentally and emotionally draining it is for a non-neurodivergent to deal with someone very autistic, and you can read more on my pinned posts, but this is what happened to my ex-friend/ex-partner: he couldn't deal with my very autistic needs and partner. He thought he would be okay dating someone very autistic but found out a month later that this friendship/relationship was something he didn't want to continue doing. However, back on the energy drinks.

What my friend will do is go to the gas station and send me a picture of what energy drinks are at the gas station, and I select one. I'm a huge fan of Celsius even though SOME of their products taste nasty, and there are some Celsius products that taste cool/awesome though! Alani is another favorite of mine for energy drinks, and after we pick out energy drinks, we would either start screen sharing music or a video game for a while. I just think that's fun, and if you think this is weird or too strange. Well, I can't tell you how many times that my autistic self was/were way too overwhelming for people to deal with.

Which I should make a loud and clear statement here: just because there are 60 people in the Discord server (I don't look at the number often, so this could be inaccurate right now.) I only have about 8 contacts on my friend lists; that's because I don't and I will never individually message someone on the Discord server unless the person starts the conversation first, rather than from the posts the Redditor read on my posts or a comment the Redditor read on my profile. 

That's also what I imply when I state that, given that, I'm just chilling/vibing inside the Discord server, tending to the Discord server, occasionally texting with friends inside the Discord server (which is almost always Lorna Shore news and posting cat pictures or videos.) and seeing if anyone new messages me when joining the Discord server if there is an interest in friendship. I just wait for the friendship to come to me, as I'm getting tired of looking for friendship, and I'm finding that I'm getting that autistic burnout and feeling overstimulated by everything/needing a break. 

However, with that being stated, I hope people can feel safe and relaxed in a stress-free Discord server where the people that are very introverted and have social anxiety have a toxic-free place to be themselves/chat with others when the vibe/mood is right for their liking. With the hopes of the cute animal pictures/videos of pets, or whatever backyard birds are outside, if anyone has any memes that correspond to the Discord server, it could help someone crack a smile through the darkness, and then that is good enough for me, and I would feel a sense of relief/enjoyment within myself if that goal were to happen.

I don't know, yeah, how many people vibe with this; however, wouldn't it be cute as friends to match the Sleep Token sticker and Lorna Shore sticker on our phone cases? I think that is adorable/cute, simply and truthfully. I would hopefully one day/this could maybe and might happen to match a lot of Sleep Token and Lorna Shore stickers with my online friends; that would be cool/awesome.

However, I'm off to go play some Skyrim at 5 something a.m.",1,1759141525.0,FindLoveWorldwide,1,1.0,False
1nted7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1nted7i/symptoms_getting_worse/,Symptoms Getting Worse,"Hey, i‚Äôm 22M (smoker). I wrote in this sub a while back about dizziness i was experiencing these last 2 months. I think the first episode triggered was from a coffee and cigarettes i was having in the morning and hasnt stopped ever since. I did some blood work tests and they all are fine, nothing there explains it so i went to the ENT and they suspect of Menieres or inner ear vestibular issues and prescribed me b-complex and betahistine 16 mg twice a day. I went to neurologist as well and she prescribed me cinarizine. I dont know if its good or bad I did this but i havent taken cinarizine because i made some research and I didnt like the side effects. The neurologist said that they didnt think it was sth to do with her. Now take into account that im in a country where public healthcare is not the best, and they dont really care that much. I did an audiogram and apparently my right ear had some problems, i can feel ringing and pressure on it sometimes. After a nap yesterday it feels blocked even now. Now if i rememeber correctly i used to smoke 5 ciggs a day when i started meds , i cut coz i was worried. After two weeks of meds i felt better and started smoking like usual. Now it feels like symptoms got worse. Dizziness is not as present but the ear ringing and fullness is all day, and my eyes dont feel focused , i cant see far where i would normally see. I used to get this eyes unfocusing even before but it was with episodes now its all day. Im going into week 4 of betahistine, and idk how to feel abt this. Should i consult the doctor again, maybe go to a private one. Im also in question if its vestibular migraines as well, i got some flare ups when i was angered or when i laughed too hard. Should i try to take cinarizine. Would it be right to suspect for a neck problem as well. Ive had neck pain more than i usually have( i have to work in front of a computer all day)Ive quit coffe for 5 weeks now because it makes me horrible. 

I know its a long read but im really confused, should i do a ct scan as well, like they havent given me a diagnosis. Thanks in advance! ",1,1759141502.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
