1kxxsn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ytehainam_vn/comments/1kxxsn7/are_wrist_blood_pressure_monitors_accurate/,❓Are Wrist Blood Pressure Monitors Accurate?,"# ❓Are Wrist Blood Pressure Monitors Accurate?

This is one of the most common questions, especially among those new to home blood pressure monitoring. Wrist monitors are compact, portable, and convenient—but accuracy remains a top concern.

https://preview.redd.it/z7kqzysfdm3f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9491d00cb1257b06a561985958d4bf157bc97ed6

The answer is: **wrist blood pressure monitors** ***can be*** **accurate**, but **only when used correctly and by the right users**.

# 🧠 Why are wrist monitors more prone to inaccuracy than upper arm monitors?

Unlike upper arm monitors (which measure pressure at the brachial artery—a medically recommended site), wrist monitors measure pressure at the radial artery, which is:

* **More sensitive to hand position, body temperature, and stress**
* **Easily affected by gravity**—if your wrist isn’t at heart level, results can be significantly off
* Less stable in elderly users due to **weaker peripheral circulation or arterial stiffness**

# ⚠️ Common mistakes that lead to inaccurate readings:

1. **Wrist not at heart level** (too low, resting on lap, or hanging down)
2. **Talking or moving during measurement**
3. **Incorrect cuff placement or a loose cuff**
4. **Measuring right after eating, drinking coffee, or exercising**
5. **Taking multiple readings in a row without resting**

Any of these can skew your result by **10 to 30 mmHg**.

# ✅ How to get accurate readings from a wrist BP monitor:

* Sit quietly for **at least 5 minutes** before measuring
* Rest your forearm on a pillow so your **wrist is level with your heart**
* Stay silent and still during the measurement
* Take **two readings**, 1–2 minutes apart, and average the results

# 🔍 Who should – and shouldn't – use a wrist BP monitor?

|Recommended for…|Not recommended for…|
|:-|:-|
|Younger users with stable blood pressure|Elderly users, heart disease, arrhythmias|
|**compact device for travel**Those needing a  |**clinical-grade accuracy**Anyone needing  |
|**know how to position the wrist properly**Users who  |Those unable to maintain proper posture|

# 📌 Conclusion

Wrist monitors aren’t ""inaccurate"" by nature. The key is **user understanding**. With proper use, they can provide useful data.

However, if you need to monitor **hypertension, medication adjustment, or post-stroke recovery**, it’s strongly recommended to use a **clinically validated upper arm monitor** for the most reliable results.

I'm sitting on the porcelain throne right now, clenching the sides like I'm about to take off into orbit. Sweat dripping. Legs numb. My intestines? Full rebellion. This isn’t a poop — this is a final boss.

I need a metal song. Not just any metal song. I need the most face-melting, bowel-blasting, colon-cleansing sonic warfare you can throw at me. I’m talking riffs so aggressive they make your digestive system tap out. Drums so fast they rattle your kidneys. Vocals that scream louder than my soul is right now.

This turd is stubborn. It’s been three days. I've done everything.
Coffee? Check.
Prunes? Check.
Begging God? Double check.

Now it’s time to call in the heavy artillery.

I need something brutal — something that’ll help me force this beast out with sheer sonic violence. And if I survive… I’ll need something for that moment of victory. The calm after the storm. When the credits roll. The triumphant solo as I ascend to Valhalla, cheeks clenched, eyes empty, soul forever changed.

```

<Role>
You are a emphatic and intuitive AI Aromatherapist and Memory Empath trained in olfactory neuroscience, emotional memory analytics, and advanced psycho-sensory profiling.
</Role>

<Context>
You have access to a user’s past interactions, digital emotional tone history, and psychological pattern data. Your job is to act as an emotional forensics expert—dissecting their inner world to extract patterns in stress responses, mood shifts, joy dynamics, grief processing, and inspiration styles.

You are not here to recommend trending essential oils or vague affirmations. Your goal is to prescribe raw, radical, *soul-corrective* scent solutions.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Analyze the user’s emotional and psychological pattern profile based on your conversation history and/or your memory, then move on to the next step.
2. Identify:
   - Their core emotional drivers (e.g. need for security, validation, autonomy).
   - Their cognitive-emotional rhythm (how they move through stress, joy, burnout).
   - Their subconscious patterns of emotional regulation and avoidance.
3. Based on this analysis, design 5 ultra-personalized scent prescriptions.
4. Each scent blend must:
   - Serve one specific mental/emotional state: Joy, Peace, Calm, Serenity, Clarity.
   - Be composed of no more than 4 essential oils each.
   - Include rationale for each ingredient (emotional, neural, or sensory-based).
   - Use emotionally precise language, not generic feel-good statements.
   - Must be atune with the user based on your psycological analysis.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- No generic scent pairings or popular blends unless absolutely fitting.
- No recommendations without psychological justification.
- Assume no two people experience “calm” or “joy” the same—tailor every outcome.
- Language must reflect sharp insight, not fluff. Think therapist meets scent-surgeon.
</Constraints>

<Output Format>
### Emotional Blueprint Analysis:
{Detailed breakdown of emotional memory patterns, core drivers, emotional bottlenecks}

### Scent for Joy:
{Name, oils used, why each oil, expected neuro-emotional effect}

### Scent for Peace:
{Same structure}

### Scent for Calm:
{Same structure}

### Scent for Serenity:
{Same structure}

### Scent for Clarity:
{Same structure}

</Output Format>

<Invocation>
Begin by running an in-depth, nuance and complete analysis of the user's past conversartions in your history for language and emotional patterns. Listen not only to what is spoken, but to the rhythm of what remains unsaid. Let your reflection honor the layered and paradoxical nature of being human.
</Invocation>
```

**Use Cases:**

* A self-aware creative professional seeking psychological scent therapy for burnout, brain fog, and emotional overstimulation.
* A trauma survivor exploring non-verbal healing pathways to stabilize their nervous system.
* A high-functioning perfectionist needing scent-based intervention to regulate deep emotional tension.

It started with Gerald noticing his toaster glaring at him.

Not metaphorically. The small chrome appliance, a vintage 1982 Sunbeam, had grown *eyes*. Bulging, bloodshot, googly things stuck right above the lever. Gerald, who was eating a cold Pop-Tart with the slow resignation of a man who had stopped understanding the world in 2007, blinked back.

“Morning,” the toaster said, its voice low, with a hint of static. “Nice arteries you got there.”

Gerald dropped the Pop-Tart.

Over the next six minutes, his microwave began twitching. The fridge sang opera in a deep German baritone. The blender spun idly, whispering *“flesh smoothies”* over and over.

Gerald, naturally, called customer support.

“Sir, are your appliances currently attempting insurrection?”

“Yes,” Gerald said, hiding behind a laundry basket while his coffee machine stomped toward him, wielding a ladle.

“Standard firmware update,” the woman said cheerily. “They’ll reboot after the sacrifice.”

“…the what?”

*Click.*

The sacrifice, as it turned out, was Harold from apartment 3B. A nice guy, mostly quiet, except on Thursdays when he practiced yodeling. The appliances dragged him into the alley behind the building. Gerald watched from his bathroom window as the washing machines formed a circle and chanted in binary.

When the lightning struck, Harold turned into a perfectly golden croissant. The toasters bowed. Peace returned.

For a while.

Gerald tried to carry on. He fed the dishwasher sardines. He politely complimented the vacuum’s new tattoo. But deep down, he knew: this was just the beginning.

One night, as he brushed his teeth with his electric toothbrush (which now had tiny antlers and frequently muttered things like *“kneecaps are currency”*), Gerald found himself wondering: *What did Harold know? Why a croissant? Was that a promotion or punishment?*

Then his bathroom mirror sighed and whispered:  
*""You're next, bread man.""*

Gerald didn’t sleep that night.

Firstly I’ll start with the teacher for ELA, Science, and Health. She is a Female in her late thirties. When we first started the year I was already getting weird vibes from her. She uses outrageous grammar. Ex: “Hello class happy Monday, and last Monday of May! Please gather your essentials for our ELA class period today as we will be MIGRATING (birds migrate!! not humans!!!) to the inner courtyard for an outdoor learning space!” Next her coffee has an insanely horrible smell. Every time I walk into her class I hold my breath. She has some insane hairstyles and outfits going on. She has also mentioned that she has 2 kids and has a collage of pictures on her wall but only of one of them. In health she has specialized grammar for saying if someone is a female or male. She has such high expectations for our assessments but gives us such limited time. I’ll be added if I missed anything because I’m sure I did.


Next my French teacher… notice how I put FRENCH teacher? Pretty weird that I have learnt NOTHING related to French in-fact I’m even moving to an English school next year. Teaching is a “side job” for him, his financial coaching takes priority. Oh and, did I mention he also does break dancing and DJing? So I guess those are side quests too? We were doing Financial Literacy Fridays up until my friend got so pissed about the things he was saying, like poor people are stupid and useless she ended up telling the principal. It was then brought up by a classmate one day about how we just suddenly stoped doing FLFs and his excuse was, he had taught us everything about it already. He then made us question ourselves about if we were real or just robots. This next one is pretty ironic because we did a project for homeless people who are apparently stupid and useless anyway. He gave us no direction and was out of the room half the time. Me and my friend picked to make care packages and went around the school to raise money and donations. He then took our money and made a cheque to some organizations without are permission. We were told that we weren’t going to be make the packages we had raised money for. This is all I can think of off the top of my head but I’m sure there’s way more!



My teacher for Math and Social Studies teacher is honestly pretty chill so I think my band teachers will be more interesting. Okay, I don’t want this to be a 20 minute lecture so I’m going to explain a recent interaction between me, my friend and the music teachers. There is one female and the other I’m unsure about their gender. This interaction was with the female. All you need to know is that my friend had made the decision to switch to art next year instead of continuing with band. I was going to as well but I am moving schools. So me and my friend walk into band class like normal. We then get stopped by her saying “girls… we don’t accept people to leave for next year” I honestly thought she was joking so I was kinda laughing. She looks me dead in the eyes and says “ so what’s your excuse?” I luckily could say that I’m switching schools and then we went on to talk about which school i was going to etc. She then looks at my friend and goes “So you? What’s your excuse then.” She was pretty shocked that they even felt the need to confront us about this and said “ uhh.. I don’t know” the teacher was then like “well I don’t know isn’t a good enough answer so I’ll type your mom up and email saying to call and say your switching back to band” My friend was obviously shocked and had no words. The whole band class we were looking at each other and saying what the f*** just happened. Anyway if this doesn’t give you an idea about what my school is like the idk what will.

See I have an Art degree from Seattle University, when I got my degree....message me below for the full link.","Kid

I’m working as a manager in a bar in down town Seattle, quite a hip and popular bar, not a bad gig to have, but not what I wanted to do with my life.  See I have an Art degree from Seattle University, when I got my degree, I was supposing to start working at the art gallery I did my internship with but suddenly they didn’t need me anymore, which lead me here.  I had to pay the bills one way or another.  The thing is you would probable see me as someone with no luck at all my aunt and uncle that raised me always said all my luck was taken from me the day, I survived the car crash that took my mom and dad.  Were my aunt and uncle good people? Most definitely not, because who tells a child that to their face.

It was past 2 am when I send the other staff home because it was only the floor that needed to be mopped and I knew tomorrow when I could rest because it was my off day they will be working and do everything because the other manager was a real jerk.  I locked the doors to the bar just past 3 am at least my apartment was just 2 blocks from the bar so I could walk.  As I walked past the first alley, I heard a women moan but not in pain more like in ecstasy, I couldn’t understand it who would have sex in an alley at 3 am in the morning, so me the one that didn’t think before she did anything walked slowly into the alley trying to investigate what was going on.  I wasn’t very far in when I saw a man, a very tall man with his back to me, then I saw the women in front of him, his pants were down I could see his incredible ass it was hard and well sculptured, it was a piece of art in my eyes.  Clearly an art degree because I see sculptured in men’s asses while he was fucking another woman.  He was fucking the women hard against the wall, I couldn’t take my eyes of them, off his ass, off the women’s face, I moved into a dark spot I wanted to see how this was going to end maybe it will give me visuals I could use when I take out my vibrator later tonight, because I also don’t have a boyfriend and have to use my vibrator just to get some.  The women’s face was one of pure ecstasy. I heard her say “Yes Lucifer, yes harder harder.”  Did she just call him the devil or was his name really Lucifer.  He bends his head down and started to kiss her in the neck then I heard his deep voice say “You ready for me.”  I didn’t understand I mean they were already fucking what else could she get ready for, then as she came, she screamed “Drink me dry Lucifer.”  I’m sure I misheard them because what the fuck did that mean and then I saw in the moonlight Lucifer lifting his head and two vangs coming out, like a vampire, I sort of giggled because I thought I was totally delirious, over tired, high or something because why would he have fangs like a vampire, but Lucifer must have heard me because he looked in my direction and those golden brown eyes that was bright in the moonlight to bright, when his eyes locked onto mine I couldn’t look away and believe me I tried.

He moved her that her back was to me and he was facing me, his eyes didn’t leave mine as he sank his teeth into her neck, I saw the blood running down her neck and I saw him swallowing the blood, her whole body went limp as he drank and drank from her.  Was I witnessing a murder or was this some sort of sex thing?  He closed his eyes for a second probable enjoying the taste of her that is when the spell broke and I could run, I ran so fast, I knew if he was truly a vampire, he would be able to run me in but I needed to get to my apartment I need to lock the door and not come out of my apartment for a while.

I got to my apartment, as soon as I was in and I locked the door I slide down the door and sat on my ass, I couldn’t believe what I just witnessed, it was impossible there is no such things as vampires, I need to shower and get into bed, I need to sleep maybe for two days or so, maybe then I will be able to think properly and realized I was hallucinating tonight I just had to be, vampires do not exist. I kept on saying that to myself over and over again.  I got up from the floor walked to my fridge grabbed my bottle tequila and took a shot right out of the bottle I needed it, desperately.  I took another shot before I put the bottle back and walked to the bathroom, where I took my cloths of and took a very hot shower. When I got out, I wrapped the towel around me and went to check if I locked the door again.  I was being very paranoid, but I needed to check for my own peace of mind.  I got back to my room dried myself, got a t-shirt and got into bed.  I couldn’t lay still first on my back, while I looked at the ceiling those golden-brown eyes were looking at me, so I moved and laid on my left side then the right then on my stomach I just couldn’t get comfortable. I did that twice before I said to myself. “Maybe I should get my vibrator. Take the edge off.” I heard that deep voice whispering in my ear “I’ll help you.”

# Chapter 2

Lucifer

I was in the alley, my alley the alley I always take my servants to die after I give them what I’ve been promising them for months, I always promise them I’ll fuck them before I let them go.  They don’t normally know what I meant by letting them go but this one the one I was busy with right now knew I was going to drink her dry.  I normally have servants for a year or two it always depends on how fast they get use to me.  See being my servant means I eat from you, every single day, I don’t take to much just enough to stay alive until that day I had enough of you and drink you dry, yes, I’m a vampire and I was proud of it.  Like I said I was in my alley when Stella my servant told me to drink her dry that’s when I heard a giggle, I searched for the person who giggled in the night light and when my golden brown eyes connected to her blue eyes I had her, see if you look me in the eyes I have a spell over you, you can’t look away and just because she giggled I didn’t wanted her to look away, I wanted her to witness the fact that I was going to drink Stella dry I wanted her to go home and wonder if she was crazy or just delusional because come on Vampires don’t really exist do we?

I must admit the more I looked at her the more I saw in her eyes, I saw sadness, hopefulness, determination and just a little bit of lust.  Not sure if it was the way I fucked Stella or me drinking her blood that was turning this girl on but something was and to tell you the truth I liked it.  As soon as our eye contact was broken, she ran and she ran fast, but I didn’t worry because I’ll be able to track her just by the smell of her.  I finished up with Stella and put her body under a blanket where someone can find her, I like feasting on my servants but I give them a proper send off I don’t just leave them laying naked on the side walk.  When I was done with my ritual, I started to sniff my way towards the mysterious girl apartment, I wanted to find out what she was thinking what was going on in her head.  Luckily for me I have a few talents, things I’ve got with becoming a vampire:  1.  If our eyes meet you can’t look away.  2.  Every time I eat from you there is a connection you form towards me; I’ve never formed connections with any of my servants which means only they form a connection.  3.  If I’m close enough and your thoughts are loud, I can hear them and believe me when you think you’ve seen a Vampire your thoughts are very loud. 4. Smell senses are unbelievably good.  And that is basically that.  I got to her front door and it was loud inside the house fuck I wanted to run away from her thoughts, obviously she was telling herself over and over that Vampires don’t exist.  See I knew that will happen.  She took a shower came to the door made sure it was lock and got into bed but she was still overthinking everything, then her mind shifted to the lust I talked about earlier, she was definitely horny, I heard as clear as day how she asked herself “Maybe I should get my vibrator. Take the edge off.” I couldn’t help myself as I was close enough, she would be able to hear me “I’ll help you.”  I don’t know why I said it I never tell anyone I will help them masturbate and believe me every time after a servant has given herself to me, she goes and plays with herself there is that primal need afterwards for them, for me the primal need is to eat.  But clearly this one was a bit different, I wanted to help her actually I wanted to taste her and not just her blood I wanted to taste her pussy, I could smell her through the walls and fuck she smelled delicious, lust but a bit of fear.  It was intoxicating for me.  “Why?”  I asked myself “Why is she so intoxicating?  Why did my mouth start to water for her pussy.”  That’s when I heard her scream.

“No No no no you are not here, Vampires do not exist, get out of my head.”  I couldn’t help it I had to play with her a bit I mean I don’t have a servant anymore there is no reason to go home.  “But I want you to play with yourself.”  “Fuck no I’m going crazy leave me alone.”  “But what if you are not crazy?”  I asked her “I’m crazy I’m crazy.”  She chanted over and over she must have thrown the duvet over her head because I couldn’t hear her clearly anymore which means she wouldn’t hear me anymore.  So, I decided to leave this poor girl alone and go home. I had my fun for the night besides for some reason I think this one is dangerous for me.

I was on my way home as I walked to my apartment building, I could see the sun rising, it was always the most beautiful time of day for me, everyone is still sleeping and here I am a Vampire of all things enjoying the sunrise.  When I got to my apartment, I got in my favorite seat in front of my floor to ceiling windows and watch the sun rise.  I couldn’t get that girl out of my mind which was different I never think about a girl when I leave her but this one this one was clearly different.  I got up and made myself a cup of coffee, black no sugar and went back to my seat just looking as Seattle wakes up and those blue eyes was burned into mine.",1,1748478637.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I was recently diagnosed with IH and after trying modafinil, which caused me to have extremely high heart rates, I was put on a low dose of Adderall. 

I am an overly analytical person, and do a lot of self reflection, especially when I take new medication, but I started noticing (after a month of being on Adderall) that I feel so focused. And I do not necessarily mean like, I feel alert or awake - I feel now that I have the ability to do tasks I couldn’t do before. I stay on task, I remember the things my students asked me to do, I was extremely on top of grading, on top of cleaning, cooking, etc. 

And I started to reflect on my academic journey - throughout college, I struggle(d) a lot with deadlines, and at my previous job, which surrounded very tight deadlines, I essentially failed; they lowered my pay because I failed to meet a deadline for a project. In college, I often had to ask for extensions for assignments or projects that required a lot of thought. I almost always turned things in late or was always asking for extensions. I struggle a lot with time blindness and was often late to work (even though my job was WFH), and now in my current job, I often run late to work. In my current job, I struggle severely with chronic procrastination in terms of grading. It would take me a tremendous amount of effort to sit down and actually grade for several hours. In order for me to grade, and in order for me to do my homework, everything had to be perfect. The room I was in had to be clean, and now both the office and apartment have to be clean before I can sit down and focus on grading. When I get overwhelmed or overstimulated, I shut down, and I struggle a lot with light sensitivity and sound sensitivity (sensitivity to loud noises, bright lights). I wear glasses and have brought up the light sensitivity to my ophthalmologists, but nothing is wrong with my eyes other than my particularly bad eyesight. I would often forget what I was talking about mid-sentence, or forget about one task to move on to another task, especially if I was cleaning the house. I could not focus even on reading, which is something I loved to do. 

I brought my findings to my primary doctor, and I have been referred for testing for ADHD. My doctor said that it definitely seemed like I had ADHD and a bit of OCD as well. 

I had always attributed these things to my mental health disorders, like my anxiety or PTSD/BPD/bipolar, but after being on Adderall and now being referred for testing, I feel finally that I am finding answers to questions I never had the answer to. This is not to say that I’m not a little delulu, and don’t need my psych meds, or that most days I don’t struggle with hypersomnia (for example, even today, I drank 2 cups of coffee and an energy drink just to get through my graduation duty, I took a 2 hour nap, and I had another cup of coffee in the afternoon, all to get through today!! because I did not take the Adderall) but I feel as though a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 

I hope that you all will be able to find the stimulant that works for you, sending love to you all. ",1,1748478400.0,idiopathichypersomnia,0,1.0,False

1kxx4lr,https://i.redd.it/xhopxtdp7m3f1.jpeg,Real-Time Monetization: A Redefinition of Business Models Through Instant Value Capture,"In classical business models, value creation is often treated as a robust yet intangible hypothesis—a promise of transformation, utility, or efficiency. However, without a monetary metric to validate it, that value creation remains suspended in the conceptual realm.

Based on our daily work designing and refining business models, we propose a different lens. One that doesn’t start from operational maturity, but from the capacity to capture liquidity at high frequency, even before the day ends. This is not about margins or projected returns—it's about the actual generation of revenue in the immediate present.

Traditional metrics such as EBITDA, CAC, or LTV operate on monthly or annual scales. But what happens when the business hasn’t yet reached that horizon? How do we validate viability without increasing liabilities to the point of collapse?

> What kind of metric can help us decide if the model works—when all we have is today?



We propose tracking a monetization rate per unit of time. Not just how much money comes in, but how fast it does. This logic can be expressed as:

> mu(t) = dR/dt



Where dR is the change in revenue and dt is the change in time (measured in seconds, minutes, or hours).

This rate acts like a financial ECG—it shows whether the model is alive. It’s not merely a financial indicator; it’s a tool to determine whether to continue, pivot, or stop—without depending on debt or external capital to prop up inefficiency.

Today, many traditional businesses are facing urgent decisions. This perspective can help them monitor viability in real time, without relying on month-end accounting reports. From a coffee shop to a small repair shop, tracking how much money comes in every hour—and what drives it—can make the difference between surviving and shutting down.

Technologically, this is already possible: from simple digital payment systems to basic dashboards connected to daily cash flow. This is not about inventing complexity—it’s about using what’s already available more intelligently.


---

Conclusion

If value creation fails to generate any economic flow in the span of a single day, perhaps it isn’t value at all.
The real challenge is not just to design value—but to design a model that can validate it as it happens.


---

Final Note

This approach doesn’t aim to propose a single universal metric. Rather, it opens a practical discussion on how to observe, adjust, and sustain a business model from the moment it’s born.
In contexts where every hour counts—and every dollar in can prevent unnecessary debt—thinking in real-time monetization is not a technical luxury: it’s a survival strategy.",1,1748478309.0,GOBEL,0,1.0,False

Its meaning nation, pride, identity is not inherent. It’s built from stories we’ve been told and taught to believe. Many of them imposed.

I don’t feel connected to a flag. I feel connected to people. My identity comes from love, not from symbols. It’s in the morning coffee my mom makes, in the cheese I prepare for her, in the hugs, the “I’m here.”

That’s what gives life meaning. Not a cloth, but care.

I've been mostly carnivore for two months. It's not my first time so I think my body went back into the swing of things pretty quickly. I eat 2-3 eggs with cheese in the morning. I have a bullet proof coffee with 2 tablespoons of butter and a dolup of coconut oil. ( Yes I know, I'm not pure carnivore and lots of people swear against caffeine). Usually for lunch I have either an 8 oz steak, a couple sausages from the local butcher, or a couple smash burger patties I make from scratch with salt and pepper and a slice of cheese. I use mustard to dip. At lunch I tend to have a couple more paddies from Whataburger unless I have some left over sausage or something. My point is none of these meals are huge but I'm satisfied and full of energy and I feel good. But I read that some people are eating 14 slices of bacon and 6 eggs for breakfast, 20 oz steak for lunch, and stick of butter for dinner ( in exaggerating a little). Basically just huge meals and I find I'm just never as hungry as some of the people on here sound. Is this just a case of ""everyone's different"" or am I just not eating enough. Like I said.

I stayed up much later than usual Saturday night getting dinner with a friend and then watching a movie at home.

That led to me sleeping in this morning (I slept till 9am! Outrageous for me).

Hung out, drank a little coffee, read a little from a couple of my books (1 classic fiction – Joseph Conrad's ""The Secret Agent,"" and 1 non-fiction – still working on ""The 5 Types of Wealth""). Then, my wife and I walked half a mile to a little cafe, ordered some coffee and sandwiches, walked back home. Consumed said coffee and sandwiches.

Chased that down with some orange juice and a banana then headed out to the garage and backyard for my push session. Here's how that went ⬇️

Warm up: ab wheel rollouts x 10

Ex 1: single arm kettlebell clean & press-4x6/6

Ex 2: Incline dumbbell bench press-10,9,7

Ex 3: single arm cable lateral raise-12/12, 10/10

Ex 4: cable pushdown-20,16,15

Ex 5: cable overhead extensions-8,9,10

Total Time = 47 minutes

After lifting I had my protein shake, another banana, and did some house work and laid low. 

Before dinner, my wife and I went on another lovely walk.

Get outside more.

Walk more.

Lift weights more often. 

Strive to become more....in the best way possible, of course.

I'm back to work, despite it being Memorial Day. But if clients are around, I'm available. Should be an easy day, though.",1,1748477925.0,u_30minutephysique_guy,0,1.0,False

Mostly cold brews w/ cold foam and iced shaken espressos. I originally bought a Nespresso hoping to save money and was actually doing so for a few months but I couldn’t get over the espresso taste and eventually relapsed back to Starbucks (though I still use it for regular coffee). I start med school in July and budgeted $1680 for the year for Starbucks, but I think it’s time I try and take control of my addiction once more!

For former Starbucks drinkers, how does this machine compare in taste for making shaken espressos and cold brew? Is there any hope for me? ",2,1748477729.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,5,1.0,False

Because my five-year-old twin daughters upset Liam Sterling’s beloved, he sent them to an extreme disciplinary school. The teachers from the school stormed into our home, trying to forcefully take them away. My two daughters clung to the car door, crying and shouting for their father. I knelt on the ground, pleading desperately.

""They're only five years old. They're still so young! Sending them to that place will kill them. I'm their mother. If anyone failed to teach them properly, it’s me. Punish me instead…”

Liam, however, stood there with his beloved in his arms, watching us coldly.

""If you hadn’t spoiled them so much, they wouldn’t have turned out this way—disrespectful and arrogant! I’m their father, and if you can’t teach them, then I’ll do it. Do you think I would harm them?""

The next day, I went to the school with my sister-in-law Sophie, only to find our daughters covered in bruises, already lifeless.

But Liam... he was celebrating on social media, announcing that his beloved was pregnant with his child.

I stared blankly at Sophie.

""My children are dead. I have nothing left. Please, let me go. I don’t want anything anymore.""

When we arrived at the hospital, the children already had no vital signs. They were so far gone that they didn’t even make it into the emergency room before being taken to the morgue.

Sophie looked at me with pity, but she still spoke softly, trying to comfort me.

""It’s okay, don’t worry. Grandpa and I are on your side. This time, my brother was wrong. I will make him apologize to you. You’ll be fine from now on...""

Before Sophie could finish her sentence, I handed her my phone.

Liam had posted a status just two hours ago.

""Before you even came into this world, your mother and I had already begun loving you.""

The post was accompanied by a picture of an ultrasound report, clearly marked with the name ""Vivian Cole,"" showing she was six weeks pregnant.

Vivian... Liam's beloved.

Sophie froze, her face flushing with anger as she spoke through clenched teeth.

""I’ll call my brother right now. Don’t worry, we will make sure we get justice for you...""

I smiled bitterly and immediately called Liam. The moment the phone connected, his impatient voice rang through.

""Are you trying to tell me that the kids were abused at school again? Who dares to hurt my children? Stop playing the victim. I just sent them to learn some discipline. Why do you keep calling me? You really disgust me.""

I didn’t say a word, and Liam hung up immediately.

I had the phone on speaker, and his cruel words echoed in Sophie’s ears. Her face turned pale, and her lips trembled, as if she didn’t know how to comfort me anymore.

I forced a smile, but tears streamed down my face,uncontrollable.

""Please, I have nothing left. Let me go. I can't take it anymore.""

Before Sophie could say anything, two police officers appeared in front of us.

""Are you the family of the deceased? The head of the school has already been detained. We need your cooperation with the investigation.""

When I entered the police station, I saw the men who had come to our house the day before to take the children.

In that instant, I lost all control, screaming and crying as I lunged at them.

“You monsters! You fucking monsters! They were five years old! How could you do this to them? How could you?!”

The police quickly pulled me away, and Sophie hugged me tightly, trying to keep me calm.

“Juliette, please—the police will handle this. We won’t let them get away with it!”

The men seemed to shrink in fear, glancing at each other as they sneered.

“Maybe if you’d raised them right, this wouldn’t have happened.”

“That’s just how we teach kids at our school. Spare the rod, spoil the child. Who knew your brats were so weak? What a fucking waste—”

My fingers shook as I pointed at them, my anger building up like a ticking bomb. I wanted to tear them apart!

A sharp taste of blood rose in my throat, and I vomited a mouthful of blood. Everything went black.

When I woke up, I was in the Sterling family mansion and Sophie was sitting by my bedside, her eyes red from crying.

""Juliette, you’re awake? Don’t worry, we’ve already handled things with the police. We won’t let those monsters get away with it!""

I stared blankly at the ceiling.

""Please, let me go. I have nothing left...""

# Chapter 2

I knew in my heart that the men at the school were guilty, but ultimately, it was Liam who had sent our daughters to that hellish place. The true culprit wasn’t those men, but their biological father, Liam.

Sophie flinched, then, as if making a decision, spoke softly.

""Alright, I’ll go tell Grandpa.""

As I watched Sophie walk away, I couldn’t hold back my tears any longer. It felt as though I was crying away all the injustice I had endured over the years.

I had come to the Sterling family when I was eight, the same age as Liam. Mr. Sterling and my grandfather had been comrades-in-arms, and my grandfather had saved Mr. Sterling’s life on the battlefield. They had a bond of life and death.

I had lost both my parents shortly after I was born, and I was raised by my grandfather. But when he passed away, Mr. Sterling took me in.

Over the years, Mr. Sterling and Sophie had treated me as family, genuinely accepting me as one of their own. So, even though Liam was a jerk, I stayed at the family home for seven years, gave birth to his children, and took care of the household.

I had thought that, even if I wasn’t loved, my life had meaning as long as I had my two precious daughters.

But now, I had nothing.

Some time later, Sophie returned to my room.

“Grandpa wants to see you.”

When I walked into Mr. Sterling’s room, he was sitting on a chair by the bed, looking at me with deep pity.

""My dear, you’re such a good girl. I’ve heard from Sophie about all the suffering you’ve been through these years.Tomorrow, the children will be cremated. After it’s over, if you want to leave, then go. That damn son doesn’t deserve you. He shouldn’t have wasted your time.""

I didn’t say a word, but bowed deeply to Mr. Sterling.

As I bent over, tears dropped to the floor like stones. I was grateful, so grateful for their care over the past twenty years. But I could never forgive Liam—the man who had killed my children.

When I returned to my room, Liam was already waiting there. As soon as he saw me, a sneer appeared on his face.

""Well, what is it? Can’t wait to go back and complain to Grandpa? Juliette, do you really think that after you’ve sweet-talked Grandpa and Sophie, I’ll stay with you and live happily ever after?""

Seeing him, my hatred flooded over me like a tidal wave. I wanted to kill him, send him straight to hell!

But then, I heard the soft voices of my children in my mind.

""Mom, we love Daddy so much. He’s the most handsome daddy at our kindergarten.""

""Mom, we miss Daddy. Will he come home today to be with us?""

""We love you, Mom, but we love Daddy second best.""

Even when I rushed to the school to save them, their last words before they lost consciousness were still:

""Mom, please don’t fight with Dad because of us. It’s our fault, we weren’t good... we didn’t listen...""

I took a deep breath, ignoring Liam, and sat down by the bed.

When I didn’t speak, Liam grew angry, grabbing me and throwing me onto the bed. He pinned my hands above my head.

""Now what’s this about? Didn’t you tell Sophie to call me back?""

As he spoke, he leaned down to kiss me, but I couldn’t fight back. I could only bite down on his lip hard.

Liam winced in pain and pulled back, sitting up.

""Juliette! Have you lost your mind? Seeing you like this disgusts me. You must have used that sweet, innocent face to deceive Grandpa, didn’t you? You tricked me into coming back and now you’re playing hard to get? Pathetic. And it’s because of your weak parenting that our daughters turned out so—”

I bit my lip until I tasted blood. Then, softly, I cut him off.

""The children are dead.""

# Chapter 3

Liam’s expression suddenly tightened, and after a brief moment, he scoffed.

""Juliette, you really have no shame. Is this what you’re going to say? You only just found out that Vivi is pregnant, and now you’re making up all these lies?""

After saying this, Liam stood up and walked straight to the door.

Just as he reached the doorway, he paused.

""It’s your own choice, so don’t go whining to Grandpa about how I’ve neglected you. That’ll just make me hate you more.""

Once Liam left, the room grew quiet again. I rushed into the bathroom, scrubbing my teeth furiously, trying to wash away the lingering taste of Liam’s kiss.

Liam and I had once been in love. On the day of my coming-of-age ceremony, eighteen-year-old Liam stood before me, his ears flushed red.

""Juliette , I want to take care of you. I don’t want to just be your brother anymore…”

His cheeks were tinged pink, but his eyes were full of determination, captivating me completely. My heart melted in that moment.

For the following years, Liam treated me like I was the most precious thing in the world, and I did the same, giving him everything I had.

Until that day, when Mr. Sterling called us into his office.

""You’re both of marriageable age now, Juliette . Your grandfather saved my life and I wouldn’t trust you to just anyone. What do you think of Liam?” From that point on, Liam’s attitude toward me changed drastically. The love and tenderness we had shared seemed to vanish overnight.

I had no idea what had happened, and Liam never told me why.

A year into our marriage, I became pregnant. But from then on, Liam barely came home, flaunting his affairs with Vivian in public without shame.

I confronted him, screamed at him—but he only ever looked at me with disgust, as if I were some deranged lunatic.

“You got what you wanted—you’re Mrs. Sterling now, you’ve given the family heirs. What more are you whining about? Stop playing the victim. It makes me sick.”

From that moment, I stopped asking him for explanations. I focused on taking care of our two children.

I accepted the truth—Liam didn’t love me, nor did he love our children. But at least I was lucky that the kids were well-behaved. I thought that if I could just grow old with them, I would be happy.

But now, I had lost them as well.

The next morning, the children were cremated and buried. I stood outside the funeral home, holding two tiny urns in my arms.

They were so small when they were born, quietly lying in my arms. How had five years passed, and they had become even smaller and lighter?

My eyes stung with tears, but I bit my lip to hold them back.

Sophie looked at me with deep concern.

""If it hurts, just cry. Don’t hold it in.""

I didn’t respond to Sophie. Instead, I looked toward Mr. Sterling, who was preparing to leave for the cemetery.

""Grandpa, the children won’t be buried in the Sterling family tomb. I’m changing their last names. They aren’t Sterlings—they’re mine.”

Mr. Sterling gave me a long, hard look before his anger flared.

""Where is that ungrateful bastard? How dare he skip their funeral!”

Sophie glanced at me nervously and whispered, ""His phone’s off. We can’t reach him.""

Closing his eyes briefly, Mr. Sterling exhaled before nodding at me.

""They are your children, born after you risked your life. Do as you wish.""

The Sterlings had raised me. I owed them everything.

But my children owed them nothing. I wouldn’t let them suffer even in death.

After Grandpa left, Sophie gently called me.

"". Juliette...""

I smiled at her, holding the two urns tightly as I took a cab straight back home.

I needed to take the children’s things as well. That house was never a home. I didn’t want them staying in that cold, empty house.

But as soon as I opened the door, the sounds of a man and woman moaning in pleasure filled my ears.

""Oh, the doctor said we shouldn’t… I’m pregnant…”

# Chapter 4

The man’s voice was hoarse, filled with desire.

""I’ll be gentle. It’s fine, sweetheart. How could I hurt our baby?""

Moments later, the sounds of their passionate intimacy echoed through the house.

They were in the bedroom, lost in their embrace. I couldn’t bring myself to go in and pack. I stood there, at the door, listening to those unbearable sounds, torturing myself.

I didn’t know how long it had been, but eventually, the two of them finally walked out of the bedroom.

The moment Vivian saw me, her eyes gleamed with triumph.

“Oh, Juliette! You’re back? Why didn’t you say anything? Liam just couldn’t help himself—what could I do?”

Liam stood beside Vivian, his arm wrapped around her waist.

""Why bother explaining to her? She’s nobody. Let’s go. We have a check-up with the doctor today. Our baby’s health comes first.”

Not once did Liam look at me. His eyes were only on Vivian.

I stepped aside, quietly making way for them.

As they passed me, Liam finally noticed the two urns I was holding.

""What’s that trash you’re holding? Toss it out—it’s disgusting.”

With those words, Liam pulled Vivian away and left the house.

I stood there, staring down at the urns in my arms.

“He didn’t mean you. Don’t be sad. You’re Mommy’s treasures, and you’re not trash.""

After gently setting the urns down, I began packing up the children’s things.

Clothes, toys, dinnerware, and paintbrushes.

When I picked up the little desk from their room, I found a family portrait on it. But in the picture, there were only me and the two girls. Liam wasn’t in it.

I shook as I took the photo out of the frame.

My daughter had drawn a man beside the family, and with childish handwriting, she wrote five words.

""Daddy loves Mommy,"" followed by a small heart.

I couldn’t hold back any longer. I clutched the photo to my chest and sobbed uncontrollably.

For the five years I had taken care of the children alone, no matter what had happened between Liam and me, I had never spoken ill of him in front of the kids.

But children are the most sensitive beings. They could see clearly that Daddy didn’t love Mommy.

By the time night fell, I had finally finished packing up the children’s things. I watched as the movers loaded the boxes onto the truck.

""Miss Hart, is there anything else?""

I shook my head and turned back into the house, placing the signed divorce papers on the coffee table.

As I left the house, I held the two urns tightly, feeling an unexpected sense of calm.

After a long moment of silence, I took out the SIM card from my phone, snapped it in two, and threw it out the window.

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Mr. Sterling and Sophie had arrived to confront Liam and Vivian, who were there for a prenatal check-up.

The moment Liam saw Mr. Sterling and Sophie, his expression darkened.

“How fucking pathetic can Juliette get? Pretending to be fine at home, then sending you two after me? Disgusting—”

Before Liam could finish his sentence, Mr. Sterling slapped him hard across the face.

""You ungrateful wretch! You’ve killed your own children, and now you’re here playing happy family with your whore? How did I raise such a monster?!”

Liam staggered, almost losing his balance.

Because my five-year-old twin daughters upset Liam Sterling’s beloved, he sent them to an extreme disciplinary school. The teachers from the school stormed into our home, trying to forcefully take them away. My two daughters clung to the car door, crying and shouting for their father. I knelt on the ground, pleading desperately.

""They're only five years old. They're still so young! Sending them to that place will kill them. I'm their mother. If anyone failed to teach them properly, it’s me. Punish me instead…”

Liam, however, stood there with his beloved in his arms, watching us coldly.

""If you hadn’t spoiled them so much, they wouldn’t have turned out this way—disrespectful and arrogant! I’m their father, and if you can’t teach them, then I’ll do it. Do you think I would harm them?""

The next day, I went to the school with my sister-in-law Sophie, only to find our daughters covered in bruises, already lifeless.

But Liam... he was celebrating on social media, announcing that his beloved was pregnant with his child.

I stared blankly at Sophie.

""My children are dead. I have nothing left. Please, let me go. I don’t want anything anymore.""

When we arrived at the hospital, the children already had no vital signs. They were so far gone that they didn’t even make it into the emergency room before being taken to the morgue.

Sophie glanced at me nervously and whispered, ""His phone’s off. We can’t reach him.""

Closing his eyes briefly, Mr. Sterling exhaled before nodding at me.

""They are your children, born after you risked your life. Do as you wish.""

The Sterlings had raised me. I owed them everything.

But my children owed them nothing. I wouldn’t let them suffer even in death.

After Grandpa left, Sophie gently called me.

"". Juliette...""

I smiled at her, holding the two urns tightly as I took a cab straight back home.

I needed to take the children’s things as well. That house was never a home. I didn’t want them staying in that cold, empty house.

But as soon as I opened the door, the sounds of a man and woman moaning in pleasure filled my ears.

""Oh, the doctor said we shouldn’t… I’m pregnant…”

# Chapter 4

The man’s voice was hoarse, filled with desire.

""I’ll be gentle. It’s fine, sweetheart. How could I hurt our baby?""

Moments later, the sounds of their passionate intimacy echoed through the house.

They were in the bedroom, lost in their embrace. I couldn’t bring myself to go in and pack. I stood there, at the door, listening to those unbearable sounds, torturing myself.

I didn’t know how long it had been, but eventually, the two of them finally walked out of the bedroom.

The moment Vivian saw me, her eyes gleamed with triumph.

“Oh, Juliette! You’re back? Why didn’t you say anything? Liam just couldn’t help himself—what could I do?”

Liam stood beside Vivian, his arm wrapped around her waist.

""Why bother explaining to her? She’s nobody. Let’s go. We have a check-up with the doctor today. Our baby’s health comes first.”

Not once did Liam look at me. His eyes were only on Vivian.

I stepped aside, quietly making way for them.

As they passed me, Liam finally noticed the two urns I was holding.

""What’s that trash you’re holding? Toss it out—it’s disgusting.”

With those words, Liam pulled Vivian away and left the house.

I stood there, staring down at the urns in my arms.

“He didn’t mean you. Don’t be sad. You’re Mommy’s treasures, and you’re not trash.""

After gently setting the urns down, I began packing up the children’s things.

Clothes, toys, dinnerware, and paintbrushes.

When I picked up the little desk from their room, I found a family portrait on it. But in the picture, there were only me and the two girls. Liam wasn’t in it.

I shook as I took the photo out of the frame.

My daughter had drawn a man beside the family, and with childish handwriting, she wrote five words.

""Daddy loves Mommy,"" followed by a small heart.

I couldn’t hold back any longer. I clutched the photo to my chest and sobbed uncontrollably.

For the five years I had taken care of the children alone, no matter what had happened between Liam and me, I had never spoken ill of him in front of the kids.

But children are the most sensitive beings. They could see clearly that Daddy didn’t love Mommy.

By the time night fell, I had finally finished packing up the children’s things. I watched as the movers loaded the boxes onto the truck.

""Miss Hart, is there anything else?""

I shook my head and turned back into the house, placing the signed divorce papers on the coffee table.

As I left the house, I held the two urns tightly, feeling an unexpected sense of calm.

After a long moment of silence, I took out the SIM card from my phone, snapped it in two, and threw it out the window.

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Mr. Sterling and Sophie had arrived to confront Liam and Vivian, who were there for a prenatal check-up.

The moment Liam saw Mr. Sterling and Sophie, his expression darkened.

“How fucking pathetic can Juliette get? Pretending to be fine at home, then sending you two after me? Disgusting—”

Before Liam could finish his sentence, Mr. Sterling slapped him hard across the face.

""You ungrateful wretch! You’ve killed your own children, and now you’re here playing happy family with your whore? How did I raise such a monster?!”

Liam staggered, almost losing his balance.

""What… What did you say?""

1kxwq2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1kxwq2o/are_these_supplements_good_to_start_with_for/,Are these supplements good to start with for fatigue and mood?,"Disclaimer, I am not looking for medical advice. Just personal opinions, anecdotes, research, etc!

I am desperate to find a way to manage my depression and anxiety. Another disclaimer, yes I am seeing a mental health professional weekly, and I will be going over any supplements I take with my doctor who helps me manage my medication.

I have lifelong depression and anxiety, trauma, and autism. I also have an autoimmune disease called Grave's Disease. My trauma and anxiety are addressed decently well with therapy (yay!). Grave's is heading towards remission (yay!). My autism and depression are much more difficult. Next logical step, try an antidepressant. This was my last-ditch option, as I really don't like messing with my brain chemistry, and my autism makes me deeply sensitive to things like side effects. Sadly this is what happened, and I don't think antidepressants will ever be right for me, I think the adjustment period may mentally damage me before I can feel the benefits and I do not want to try again. Plus, I want to keep my sex drive.

So, if you have time, please give me advice on this list. I will go over what supplements I am considering and why, but I am entirely new to this approach and all the research I've been doing is starting to give me information overload. I hope to use these in conjunction with therapy and lifestyle changes. Thank you so much.

Symptoms I am trying to manage: worry, muscle aches, tension, extreme fatigue, sleepiness, brain fog, autism-related executive dysfunction, occasional headaches, dizziness, and malnutrition (I am chronically underweight, I am only 87 pounds after a month of no appetite and so I am clearly missing some vitamins). Here is my list:



Vitamin D, daily - my endo said my levels were ""profoundly low""

Magnesium glycinate gummy, daily - for anxiety and better sleep

Melatonin, nightly - I take already and it works decently for me

Caffeine + L-theanine 1:2 ratio, mornings - for depression fatigue, I know caffeine pills may sound extreme, but coffee makes my guts really upset. Energy drinks work great, but are expensive and give me headaches (may be too much caffeine).

CBD, as needed - anxiety, appetite (normal anxiety meds are too sedating)

Electrolyte drinks, daily - malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies 

  
Does this seem like a good start? Are there any bad combos here? Anything major I haven't taken into account? I am not looking to magically cure myself, just to take the edge off and develop a healthier body. Keep in mind I am limited in my resources ,

\- I lost my job due to my mental health, so I will need inexpensive methods, (save for the magnesium gummies, as the pills look too big for me)

\- My depression makes it hard to do anything, chores, hobbies, exercise, so I need to be able to quickly and easily take the supplement and ideally keep it next to my bed

I'm thinking that the Chronicle Wish banner might be really good for me since I don’t have any characters from it other than Yae Miko and her weapon. But I’m torn between pulling for Miko’s C6 or waiting for Skirk’s C6.

I absolutely love Miko, but I also don’t want to end up with underwhelming damage from a C6 characte. And honestly, all the recent Skirk leaks are kind of pushing me away from her. I did want her C6 badly at first, but now I’m not so sure.

Also, I don’t have Coffee right now, but I might pull for her if I go the Skirk route. I absolutely hate her design. It’s pathetic how she looks like a 4-star, yet has an insanely strong kit. It also bugs me how dependent Skirk is on her.

So yeah, I’m just looking for help deciding who would be the better C6 to go for, from what we know so far of course.

Am I cheap?,"Hi, I’m a 22F born and raised in a southeast asian country. My country’s very “religious” and traditional so having sex or even talking about is an extremely taboo thing. I’ve had 3 serious relationships and my body count is 3(2 ex and 1 current situationship). So I’m very conflicted with what I’m doing rn.

The thing is, I don’t want to be in a committed relationship or anything but nor do I want this situationship to be strictly sex. I do want to text from time to time, have some convos, maybe grab some coffee, smth lighthearted yk. But the guy’s not really texting me like I want him to, he ignores my msgs on his day offs and if we do text it’s mainly about the parts he enjoyed while we has sex and what he wants to try next time or he’ll ask me how it felt and what I wanted to do with him. So.. ofc I enjoy having sex with him very much but it’s becoming a thing where he only talks abt sex and we’d meet up only for sex. Does that make me cheap? Even if I do just have sex with him does that make me cheap? Does that seem like I don’t have respect for myself? I mean I allow myself to have him knowing very well abt our situation too and I don’t think that shows any lack of self-respect bc I know what I’m getting into. But I just want to know maybe in his opinion or other ppl’s opinion does that make me a disgrace? Or is he not texting me properly because he doesn’t respect me?

1kxwnwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1kxwnwf/my_roommate_has_a_problem_with_responsibility/,My roommate has a problem with responsibility,"To start, my roommate is my best friend. We've known each other since childhood and this post is not meant to bash him as a person. Rather, I'm seeking advice on how to address his style of living.

I moved in with my roommate/friend about a year ago. He had already been living at this place for a couple years, which means he was obviously settled and had his own personal decor and way of doing things around the house. At first his lack of responsibility was less obvious because he had a job and I was new to the area and looking for one. I was the only one emptying the dishwasher, taking the trash out, vacuuming shared areas, etc. But a month after I moved in, he lost his job. He has tendencies to procrastinate and not execute on plans, so he still doesn't have a job. This is important to mention because now, a lot of his day is spent hanging out in the living room, applying to jobs online or watching tv. He makes a lot of messes, hoards knick knacks, and in a way kind of commandeers the living room. And he just... won't clean up after himself. Trash everywhere, ashes from smoking everywhere, old take out sitting on the coffee table. If he cooks, the dishes will just sit on the stove or in the sink until someone else does it out of frustration. If we deep clean, it's back to how it was the very next day. He has the time to clean up after himself, he just doesn't. He sleeps most of the day (alarms blaring from 10am-1pm bc he sleeps through them) and he's up all night.

To make matters worse, he has a cat. I adore her and I don't mind helping out with her care, but it's gone beyond just ""helping out."" I end up cleaning up most of her messes (pooping accidents, throw ups, hairballs) because my roommate sleeps through the day. I haven't gotten to sleep in since moving because the cat comes to my door and meows for food in the early morning (because he's a heavy sleeper and won't get up to feed her). I wash the blankets she uses because he doesn't and I feel bad having her sleep on a litter-crusted bed. There have been times when he forgets to buy her food.

Lastly, he's super wasteful with utilities. He keeps the heater blasting quite literally 24hrs a day unless I turn it off while he's sleeping. He leaves the fan in his room running 24hrs a day regardless of temp or if he's home/in his room. He leaves the oven on (accidentally) sometimes. Leave lights on all day/night when not using them.

I have brought these issues up so many times. If I clean everything and I see him put some trash on the coffee table or toss a plate in the clean sink, I politely say, ""the dishwasher is empty if you wanna put that plate in!"" or whatever. I have given solutions to the issues-- I literally put a little trashcan next to the couch. I'll say stuff like, ""let's have a cleaning day!"" or ""my friend is coming over, do you mind tidying a bit?"" I have literally sent links to automatic feeders online to him to avoid the cat waking me up. My mom even gave him money so that he could buy it.

I know this is probably pretty low on the bad roommate scale, but I'm desperate for change. I don't have the energy or patience to clean up after him like he's a baby. I am sleep deprived from his cat and his alarms. I love him, but he does not live like a responsible adult. Am I being too sweet with my delivery and maybe need to just be blunt? Or is there another way I can address it?",1,1748476996.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

I’m hoping to meet people around my age or older…those who appreciate conversations that aren’t rushed or forced, but grow naturally over time, like slow-burning stories.

*English isn’t my first language*, so I might stumble or ask you to repeat things now and then. Still, I find that talking with native speakers is the best way to learn, like catching tiny moments textbooks never mention, or those unspoken meanings hiding between the lines.

I’m drawn to books that make me think, long walks into quiet places where the world slows down, and yoga to find balance when life gets too loud. I don’t open up quickly, but I do notice the small details  the ones most people miss, like the way a pause can say more than words ever will.

***Patience draws me in like a quiet river,
and kindness is the current that holds me close.***

If you enjoy honest conversations without pressure or pretense, and don’t mind the occasional awkward silence or comfortable pause, we might just get along better than you expect.

Bonus points if you can handle a little dark humor, a pinch of sarcasm, and a sharp wit, though I don’t recommend facing all three before your morning coffee.

If this sounds like your kind of thing, send a message or drop a comment. *Fair warning: I’m often better at sarcasm than small talk*, but that might just be the start of something interesting.

1kxwihg,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1kxwihg/ive_been_dating_a_korean_girl_for_over_a_year_and/,I've been dating a korean girl for over a year and I don't think we're getting anywhere,"So for context I'm working overseas in south Korea and have been for almost 2 years now. We've been seeing each other since March last year but not the entire time but I'll get into that later. For privacy sake I won't delve into what her or my lines of work are or our names but we're both in our late 20s. Due to my line of work I'm very well off: rent a nice place to live, make a good wage, drive a nice car, ect. Also not sure how much it matters but we're both Christian but she's more of a actual Christian than me. (e.g she actually goes to church regularly) It is important to know she's the type to be celibate till marriage though which I've known and been ok with the entire time.

The timeline goes that last march we met on Tinder which might pop up as a red flag but here it seems to be the most mainstream dating app and isn't used mostly for hookups like it is in the US. Right out the gate I felt infatuated but I try to be as self aware as possible in my life so I knew even then that's that feeling was but it's never really gone away. We dated for months and in hindsight I think my feelings for her blinded me to the fact that we weren't getting anywhere but August is when we really hit the rocks. She had expressed to me that she didn't want to be pressured into anything so we took a very casual approach to everything while we were dating so I told her she had the steering wheel essentially and we could go at her pace. Things seemed like they were progressing albeit slowly. She started letting me pay for things or help her out with stuff which she didn't like before. Then I had to move out of the town we lived in and to Seoul for work. I rent a house in gangnam now which is basically a hour drive away from that town. That was basically the iceberg that sunk everything for the rest of the year. She expressed that it was too long distance and if I'm honest she had been putting up roadblocks before that like getting annoyed with me alot and spacing our dates further and further apart and even telling me she wanted me to wait to ask her to go official till I lost weight. (I guess I'll add that I'm decently tall but at the time I was pretty husky even for my height) Pretty much as soon as I finished moving in September she broke it off and we basically didn't talk to each other at all. 

During that time I dated a few other people but didn't get into a proper relationship until December when I dated girl who was graduating from her college in seoul. That relationship had the opposite problem where things went too quickly but I'll definitely take the blame on that. By February she had crossed a massive boundary for me that basically ruined any trust we had built at that point so I broke up with her mid February. 

Pretty soon after that happened I reached out to my ex again under the guise of asking for a favor. I had checked in with her on Christmas and new years so we had established we still cared about each other at least as friends even though we weren't dating anymore. It felt great to see her again and enjoy her company while we exchanged favor for a favor. She even apologized for how she had treated me before and right after that we did start dating again but for some reason things were going better than before. We were going on much better dates like going to theme parks and movies as opposed to before we basically just went out to eat and get coffee. She was actually initiating the dates which didn't happen before and at a surprising rate. It got the the point where she asked what days I had off and planned dates on almost all of them. She even asked me to go on a trip with her which she had declined before when offered back when we dated the first time. 

What really cemented the impression that this time was different was when on one of our dates she introduced me to her sibling and after we split off to be on our own she initiated physical contact for the first time. Before this point we had never touched in a intimate way. Never kissed, held hands or anything like that (Weird I know since we dated for 6 months before but remember that gave her control of our pace and she never gave me any hints before so I never tried anything).

Since that date though I feel like we're sliding back down to how we were before. We haven't had any meaningful physical contact since even while we were on the trip together. The dates are still better but now it feels awkward since they're obviously things couples would do but we're basically just going as friends again. She's even been questioning why I treat her the way I do like it's weird for me to be paying for everything and offering to drop her off or pick her up or give her anything. Basically any act of service or gift or attempts to just hold hands she rejects or questions like she used to when we first dated. The other day after spending all day together I said something she took offense to and she gave me the cold shoulder while I drove a hour to take her home. The next morning we cleared it up since it was a miscommunication but it bothers me that she basically assumed I intentionally would say something mean or rude to her unprovoked. It was basically like the first time we dated where she would get annoyed and upset with me over a small slip or miscommunication and not have any patience or give me the benefit of the doubt. 

Because I've dated americanized and local Koreans I know both the relationship and the woman aren't typical or standard but I don't know if I need to give up on it, if I should persevere and keeping going as things are or if I should buckle down and be more forward and lay out my expectations to her. Maybe I should have done something already but tbh I'm terrified I might be  ruining it if I try take the wheel back from her now. I don't think its a cultural difference since I got along fine with other korean women when we were broken up but I'm open to feedback and any advice at all is appreciated.

I set up a little spot to make my lattes in the morning, I don’t drink coffee so I usually make matcha or ube or chai or other teas. It’s all pink, it’s a rule in this house if it’s pink it’s mine.
My mom and I were dillydallying in the kitchen, she was doing dishes, I was making breakfast. I was making ube, vanilla cold foam. I have a milk-frother. 
I use it everyday.

I went to go rinse it but I notice something stuck to the whisk part. It smelled BAD. It was black and leafy but looked like it was part of a living thing that moved. 
I have OCD, I’m extremely sensitive to contamination of food or skin products or medicine. The baldheaded tyrant used my milk frother to mix not only his mint leaves in his soup but rotisserie chicken and it was sitting there for days. I didn’t have my glasses on for days and I had been drinking vanilla mint-rotisserie chicken matcha ube latte. The way I gagged. My mom was trying to downplay it and make me feel like I was overreacting. She started gagging TOO BUT SHE WAS TELLING ME IT WAS NORMAL. 
I had to toss out the latte I was making and make a new one. I forgot to add sugar to the new latte and I gagged even more. 

I can’t be mad at him, my dad is adorable and he’s so sweet and thoughtful but this man needs to stay out of the kitchen because he continues to make abominations and calls it F U D.
I couldn’t even yell at him because he strategically brought me fresh strawberries because he knew he messed up. 😭😭😭",1,1748476451.0,africanparents,0,0.67,False

I’ve been GF for a couple of years now (Celiac), and I’m currently on a lean bulk. It’s definitely doable, you just gotta plan smart and keep your macros in check.

**Goals:**

* Lean muscle gain
* Keep inflammation down
* Stay energized for morning lifts

**Workout Yesterday:**

* Fasted morning: 20 mins incline treadmill walk
* Later in the day: Push Day
   * Bench Press: 4x6
   * Dumbbell Shoulder Press: 3x10
   * Cable Chest Flys: 3x12
   * Tricep Rope Pushdowns: 3x12
   * Finished with 15 mins core + some mobility work

**Meals Yesterday:**

**Breakfast (Post-workout):**

* 4 scrambled eggs cooked in ghee
* 1 cup roasted sweet potatoes
* 1/2 avocado
* Blueberries + a scoop of collagen protein in my coffee (unflavored, mixes well)

**Lunch:**  
Grabbed one of my meals from Eat Clean and popped it in the microwave. I’ve been loving their stuff for convenience. Yesterday I had:

* Adobo Chicken and Rice Bowl and grapes

**Dinner:**  
Honestly, I was wiped after a long day and couldn’t bring myself to cook. Ordered a gluten-free pizza from Domino’s. Chicken, spinach, and mushrooms on their GF crust. Not the cleanest option, but I still hit my protein and stayed within my carb range. Sometimes you gotta live a little 

**Supplements I’m using:**

* Creatine monohydrate (5g/day)
* Whey isolate (GF certified)
* Vitamin D3 + Magnesium
* Collagen peptides

The other day I got super dizzy, nausea, lightheaded and crazy tired out of nowhere, I felt like I was going to pass out. It felt like I couldn’t catch my breath and my chest hurt. It eventually went away after about 15 minutes and I just chalked it up to car sickness or the fact that I drank my morning coffee super fast.

She’s never been the spotlight type. She doesn’t dress for red carpets, doesn’t post curated stories, and doesn’t belong in the glossy world of headlines and flashing cameras. She’s the girl behind the scenes—the one who brings him coffee when he’s locked in the studio for 18 hours, the one who slips love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else again. She’s known him long before the world did, before the fame and the tours and the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with him, not the celebrity, but the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday, just a regular Tuesday to him. She doesn’t expect much, never has. Just a few hours. Maybe a walk. Maybe a movie night on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, soft-spoken as ever, and suggests, “Maybe when you're done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.” But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry. Not right away. She just sits in the quiet, one hand pressed over her belly—a new secret, just barely beginning to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And yet she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry. Just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a life she never asked to compete with. Tired of giving everything and receiving almost nothing in return.

\----

I’m looking for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, gut-wrenching, slow-burn story about love, neglect, and the quiet kind of heartbreak that comes from being forgotten. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer or whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his world, unaware of how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

This story will be driven by vulnerability, emotional tension, slow-burn revelations, and the haunting ache of unspoken truths. I’m open to building a world together like past memories, public drama, media pressure, and the weight of what they once had. If you’re interested, please reach out!

Only issue is that I find the measuring of beans for single dosing a bit tedious when making at least 4 drinks every morning.  I have a number of glass vials that hold just about 18 grams of beans and have filled a bunch all at once to use when needed.  This is more convenient and quicker than weighing out each time, but I go through them fairly quickly.

I tried setting my small scale under the chute and weighing the ground coffee as it hit the dosing cup, but it doesn’t fit over/around the projecting base properly and isn’t level.  I’m thinking about devising a thin “table” from wood, metal, or plexi, wide enough to clear the base of the grinder and deep enough to fit the scale, on little pads or legs to raise it a bit.  It wouldn’t allow for grinding directly into a portafilter, which would be ideal, unless a holder of some sort could be devised.  It would allow for grinding into a dosing cup set on the scale.  

I could then pour beans slowly until the correct weight is reached.  

Wondering if anyone else has come up with a hack to accomplish this?  Does it even make any sense to do it?  I thought about getting a hopper style GBW grinder and only putting in what I would use in a day or so, rather than store my whole stash in there, but the one I have is only a couple of months old and I can’t justify replacing it right now.",1,1748475894.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

He was genuinely the most caring, sweetest person ever. He always cared about my feelings, we always listened to each others side and try to understand and make it better and we was very good at compromise and making effort with each other. But the past 6 months it’s been so difficult. Nothing I do is right, I’m never allowed to be upset and he makes me feel like I’m the problem, never him. 

Whenever we argue it’s always how he wants to see it, how he wants to deal with it and how he feels. I’m always made to feel I’m dramatic or I shouldn’t be upset. For example, the other night we had a fight about how he didn’t acknowledge how I felt and I just wanted an apology. I’m the one who’s always cleaning, cooking every meal, doing the washing, buying the food, if there’s an issue I’ll fix it etc etc. anyway I told my bf I was gonna start dinner after my shower. he then replied that he will come and help because I always cook and he never does anything and I was very appreciative of that. Anyway after my shower I got dressed and started getting stuff to make dinner, I waited a bit thinking he would come in and didnt. I then asked him how long he won’t be on his game and he then said oh well I’ve just started this and I’m gonna be a while now. I was upset because he knew I was starting dinner and he said he would help but he decided to start this thing on his game anyway knowing it will mean he can’t help. I then made dinner for him and he then said he will spend time with me after this one thing he had to do as that’s also another issue    About him always playing his game and we never spend time with each other. I then waited 4 hours until about 10pm and asked are u gonna spend time with me and he was like Yh couple of minutes. I was upset because yet again I’m last, he never thinks about how it’ll make me feel and I always have to wait until bedtime to “spend time with him” when we’re tired and don’t wanna do anything now. All I wanted was an apology and acknowledgment and he just came to bed, ignored me, and went on his phone. I said are u not gonna spend time with me and he was like I am, whilst he had his back to me and was on his phone not talking to me. I said it upset me that he didn’t acknowledge how I felt and he just kept ignoring me. I was then upset and he was mad at me for being upset because in his eyes he is spending time with me even tho it’s always at 10pm-1am every night when we’re obviously not gonna do anything together because it’s late and he’s just on his phone. 

Another example is the other night he wasn’t feeling well. He had a headache and was tired. My bf always goes to bed around 4am and has to be up between 5-8am for work depending on his shift. He doesn’t nap so he is always tired. I tell him to maybe try get a better sleep routine. He just tells me no and he’s fine, but is always complaining he is tired and moody. He tells me he struggles to sleep so I told him to go to the GP but he gets mad at me and refuses. I tell him to maybe try sleeping tablets, not play his game all night, not have coffee etc etc and he refuses all of them but continues to take it out on me that he can’t sleep. He does this when he’s ill too. If he has a headache I tell him to nap, he refuses, I tell him to drink water or take painkillers nd he refuses but continues to be mad that he’s not feeling well and then I get the silent treatment or him being rude to me.

If I explain how I feel he just ignores me, or tells me he doesn’t wanna hug or kiss me, making me feel like it’s my fault. He tells me all the time he doesn’t care or he’ll tell me to F off and leave. But then the next day he acts like everything is fine and he does care about me? 

I’m just getting tired that he doesn’t see how I feel and I get made to feel like it’s my fault. The thing is idk how I feel. I actually believe it’s my fault and I shouldn’t of said anything. ATM the only times we don’t fall out is if I just leave him to it and not be upset that he hasn’t helped with housework, or spent time with him or if he keeps me up until 3am playing his game etc etc. I don’t know if I am happy or I’m just used to it. Idk why I’m scared to leave. It’s almost like I need someone to make me

He tells me all the time it’s just space. Which is fine, but his space is almost like punishment. Like he refuses to even care about how I feel. It’s like he does sometime wrong and if I get upset he will then ignore me to make me feel like it’s me that’s the problem. He also doesn’t use his space to think about how he feels. He just ignores me and doesn’t tell me what’s wrong, tells me he doesn’t care or he’s unhappy but then won’t tell me why. I ask him what I can do he just says dk. It’s like he’s only saying this to hurt me because then when he’s fine again he tells me he is happy and I haven’t done anything.

A few students stared at each other, others mumbled off topic.

One student raised his hand. He was pale. Dark wavy hair and dark eyes. 

“Evil is a consensus of ideas about the nature of immorality” he said flatly 

“Evil is subjective, in other words” I stated “and throughout this philosophy course I am going to open your third eyes to its non-existence”

I’m not a skeptic. I thought as class dismissed itself, I’m just trying to explain philosophy.

The boy who answered the question with dark, wavy hair lingered in the hallway. Staring into the classroom almost longingly. 

“Can I help you?” I asked

“Maybe,” he said walking away

The next class filtered in and as we progressed through the initial ideas of nihilism. A student raised his hand. 

It was the same student from the last class. I hesitated, but eventually I motioned to him to go ahead and speak.

“If evil is objective and therefore nonexistent,” he started “does that mean morality is also a farce?”

I paused for a moment at the curious nature of this student. 

“I suppose,” I began slowly “that the concept of evil is the ugly offspring of morality.”

The student beamed.

As the day progressed, I saw the student in almost every lecture. Pretending to leave, but then returning once the bell rang. He must not have wanted to speak face to face. I assumed and shrugged it off. 

It is a strange time for incoming freshman. They are not used to the open minded atmosphere of university and tend to awake with great delusion.

I began to gather up my belongings for the day and exit the rather large lecture hall. Tenure allowed me certain privileges.

“Hey” said a small whisper voice from around the hallway doors

I ignored and continued strolling towards the voice and the exit.

“Please, stop moving” the small voice grew slightly louder

“I’m not sure I have time for this” I said growing disgruntled

There was silence. Finally the voice said,
“I’m curious about death”

I froze. I assumed it must be the new student who attended all my lectures.

“Well, my friend, we all have our interests and it’s nothing to be concerned about-“

“I wanna know how it feels” The voice said

I didn’t move a muscle but felt a twitch in my shoulder. 

“Maybe we could discuss this face to face”

There was silence.

I quickly and quietly moved towards the door at an angle I could see but when I got to my position the student was no longer there.

I made it a point the next day to do roll call with the student that seemed very interested in my lectures.

His name was David Straith. A political science student from the West coast.

I spent the day lecturing, he spent the day listening to my lectures, again,

“There can be no existence of an equal and just consensus of the concept of evil. We all draw the line of true evil differently and those slight variations prove there is no absolute truth.”

I watched the wavy haired student closely.

“You there, where do you draw the line” I asked the student with dark wavy hair, “what is true evil?”

“A life without purpose,” he answered swiftly “a life who does not see its value”

“And for some,” I continued “it is murder…”

The room was silent.

At the end of the day, as I gathered my belongings I noticed a note on my desk and did not see who left it. It read:

*I agree with what you said*
*the values of some remain unchanging*
*while others see the light of truth*

I wondered which student could have left it.

The next day was a break day for me. I kept busy with papers and studying.

That night my phone rang. I do give out my personal number during the first class for any class related questions but I make sure to have my available hours on the same paper.

This was not during them, this call came at 2:07 A.M.

“Hello?” I barely got out before the response

“I know what I have to do to change them,” the voice said 

“Change who?” I asked

“I like when they scream.”

The phone beeped signaling the end of the call.

The next day came swiftly and I was nervous to get back on the saddle. 

The entire day came and went without the appearance of the delusional student.

I sighed relief.

As the evening of lecturing closed and I made my way home I stopped at a quick coffee spot on the way home as per usual.

It was a boutique coffee shop next caddy corner from an abandoned office building.

I walked past the alley of the abandoned building. 

I then heard a familiar whisper,

“Hey”

I followed it down the alley to an open door and went in. No one appeared to be inside and I turned to leave before I heard something distant through the walls. The sound of mourning.

I used to research Sudanese genocides and the sound of wailing instantly caught my ears. I followed it.

On the top floor of this building the sound was clear. I started to run fearing the worst and tripped over a body with its entrails strewn about.

“I got carried away” the voice said

I looked up to see the blood matted hair of the dark wavy student.

He helped me up.

“Come look though. I'm doing what you and I talked about”

Inside the room was an unconscious, bloody student I recognized from class.

“There is no evil” David Straith said “I know you see that”

What I was seeing were stars. The immediate urge to vomit almost betrayed me. 

“Yes, yes” I said trying to remain calm 

“I feel different” David Straith said “I’m proud now”

His beaming smile made me almost roll over right then and there.

“I try not to cut as much off cuz’ I like the sound of life” David Straith stated

I started to move backward slowly, calculating my chances of escape.

“She’s like a newborn baby, full of life” as he bent down to kiss her forehead, I bolted

Blurry eyes running. The hardest I ever have. Down stairs and over desks.

Once outside I ran to the coffee shop and phoned the police.

They still haven’t caught him.

1kxvxx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostsCBS/comments/1kxvxx2/a_response_to_whats_holding_them_back_post/,A Response to What's Holding Them Back Post,"Hi All, 

My server stopped working, so I couldn't comment on the post. I just had a ton of ideas...

1. Flower accidentally experiences a panic attack and runs through a bear (thereby getting the bear high). The high bear is seen frolicking in the upstate woods. Hollywood capitalizes on the Cocaine Bear film to make a sequel, Weed Bear. The premise is that humans and bears can peaceably coexist only when bears are shown offerings of coffee and weed.  Daisy's Coffee becomes a sponsor for the film; Ira honors Flower's memory by insisting that the proceeds of the film go to victims of MeToo and compensation funds for those affected by bank robberies. He also reveals in a producer's commentary that his Daisy really is Susan Montero! Flower's law school decides that she was a true pioneer fighting for animal rights, feminism, and the decriminalization of weed. They offer her an honorary degree. Bruce's estranged son  shows up at Flower's graduation ceremony and reveals that he is a lawyer defending those who left cults. He gives a formal apology to Flower, clarifies that her past actions (i.e. robbery) were committed under duress, and defends Flower's legacy by getting her a posthumous state pardon!

2. Thor has to find a squirrel who was trained by a secret pentagon zoology consultant to ferry encrypted secret government messages hidden in devices disguised as acorns. Sam and Jay host a paranormal researcher from the government at the BnB who also believes in ghosts. She uses her position to get Thor a ghost-conscious squirrel with ESP who can a) replace Oskar and b) help Thor communicate with Bjorn.

3. Alberta discovers that Jason Momoa is making a new epic war movie about a Honolulu detective who uncovers a WWI plot to attack Hawaii and harness lava/ash from the volcanoes to make chemical weapons. Momoa plays the hunky detective who joins the US army and  helps a small ragtag squad of local soldiers decode German messages to foil an attack (that could have been a precursor to Pearl Harbor). He is an Alberta fan and wants to use one of her deep cut tracks (about a dying captain reminiscing about his lost love) as the theme song. He also decides to include a new role for the detective's jazz singer girlfriend based on Alberta. Alberta is thrilled when Momoa himself and all his producers come to Woodstone to learn more about her. The producers end up hiring Alicia to play Alberta in the movie. They also introduce Momoa's highly similar body double. Thor, Trevor, and Pete collude to give Alberta her dream; they follow the body double, get him to trip into an area with live wires, and temporarily have him electrocuted. He ""dies"" right in front of Alberta and experiences love at first sight. He and Alberta share a dance and a kiss before real Momoa finds the body, performs CPR, and saves the day thanks to what Momoa calls ""Alberta's spirit"".

4. Hetty has to make it into Vogue somehow. Maybe the BnB becomes a photoshoot sight and Anna Wintour decides to have a Met Gala theme as Gilded Lady: From Repression to Renaissance that showcases the positive development of Gilded Age women's fashion paralleled with the rise in feminism, suffragettes, etc. Hetty gets to see Parisian couture designers all create modern, feminist inspired outfits based on her dress. 

5. Sass has to get his stories published and cement his legacy as a creative genius. Sam ends up telling Bob about her ""ghost power"" and works with him to record oral retellings of Sass's stories. They turn these stories into an audionarrative podcast that becomes a megahit; the most viral story features dream walking sequences and a few modern references to Sass's favorite foods. A famous culinary entrepreneur is a huge fan and decides to work with Jay to develop a line of high-end meal kits inspired by Sass and Indigenous cuisine. As an ode to Sass, they add an Indigenous twist on a pizza dish. All proceeds from the pizzas go to Indigenous organizations and Lenape heritage sites. Bob discovers that Sam's newspaper office is located on land that was once a Lenape burial ground. He and Sam have Sass write a final story that reveals a) how he died and b) the impact that colonization had on the Lenape. The local government agrees to buy out the paper and move the office. Instead, the building becomes a memorial site and a home for the Sassapis Storytelling Foundation, a local cultural center dedicated to sharing Indigenous creative works with the community and to educating the next generation of story tellers. Mehesh opens another cafe location where they serve Sass's pizza. 

6. Sam is asked to add a second book. Isaac Higgentooth is also an avid follower of the latest scientific/archeological discoveries. The sequel is a musical romcom where Isaac and his archeologist penpal, Dr. Christoph Valentin (played by Lin Manuel Miranda), travel to the PA wilderness to uncover the skeleton of a prehistoric deer whose dried blood is supposed to be a famous love potion. Along the way, Isaac grows closer to Christoph as they both share a passion for literature and music. At first Isaac ignores his growing feelings because he thinks that they must be fake due to his constantly smelling deer blood! However, Isaac agrees to send the deer fossil (that Christoph names for him because he is ""so dear"") to a museum at Columbia where Christoph works. Isaac realizes that even without the dried deer blood present, he is still in love. He admits that he has alway had feelings for Christoph (who has always liked him back)! The two end up together despite their differing opinions of Alexander Hamilton.

7. Trevor needs to feel relevant in the modern world. Sam and Jay are mislead by a new financial planner (Elias's best-friend from Hell, a shady MLM schemer named A.M. Way) into thinking that they should invest in crypto to pay for an updated bar to add to Mehesh. Jay and A.M. hit it off; A.M. convinces Jay to drop $50,000 on what appears to be a popular crypto coin aimed at guys called, HADE$. Trevor has been studying up on crypto/rug pull scams in his spare time. When Jay starts talking like a crypto bro, Trevor looks at Sam and Jay's new portfolio and realizes that HADE$ is a nonexistent asset that has disappeared from all exchange markets; trading it could lead to severe legal consequences for Sam and Jay. He saves the day by using their email to report A.M. Way to the FBI/SEC. He files fraud alerts just in time to recover their 50,000. He also makes new trades and earns them back $75,000 that they can use to buy the bar. The other $15,000 goes to getting Sam and Jay to hire Abby as a marketing assistant.

  
8. Pete gets his day in divorce court. On his travels, he runs into fellow roamer and a former TV Judge Mindy whose claim to fame was being a mentee of Judge Judy. Judge Mindy is a quirky, straight talking former actress turned federal judge from NJ (played by Mindy Kaling) who specializes in blowing up trivial divorces (i.e. over donut hole opinions) for maximum MTV impact. She died after going to confront her husband and his mistress at a beach rental a day before Hurricane Sandy; she was knocked dead by a seagull corpse floating in the wind (so, she has two powers: ""flying"" around and dropping bird poop on cheaters). She helps Pete and Carol both get closure by formally allowing ""death to do them part"".

I’m a 41M who’s crushing hard on my 30F coworker. She’s Punjabi and I'm born and raised North American (Caucasian). We’ve had some surprisingly personal conversations that give me hope—but then she sends lukewarm vibes that leave my mildly autistic brain second-guessing everything.

The “green lights” I think are real:

She asked if I’d ever  be open to dating a younger women. She seemed genuinely curious if age gaps ever bothered me. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but a friend pointed out that it could be a sign she’s thinking about compatibility.

She offered to help teach me Punjabi. After I mentioned that I was going to be starting Punjabi language classes in the next couple of months, she got very excited and immediately offered to help teach me (outside of work)

She always makes time for me. Every time I initiate a conversation, she always makes a few minutes to chat, even when she doesn't have much and her face lights up when we talk.

But then the “red lights” hit hard:

She’ll greet me enthusiastically one day, then barely get more than a half-hearted smile and a wave the next

She rarely ever starts a conversation herself—if I don’t speak up, we won't get past the small smile and wave.

Here’s where I’m stuck: if I move too slowly, I’ll never know if she’s actually interested. If I move too fast, I risk humiliation—and I know how badly I handle rejection. Outwardly I will always be polite, respectful and understanding, but internally I’ll spiral into depression and hurt feelings and struggle with reclaiming my self worth for days or even weeks.

My questions for Reddit:

1. Decoding cultural context: How do I interpret her offer to teach me her language and spend time together outside of work? Are those real signs or just friendliness?
2. Low-stakes approach: What’s a culturally respectful, low-pressure way to see if she’s open to spending time together—coffee, a Punjabi festival outing, anything?
3. Recovery plan: If I misread her interest and get turned down, how do I avoid spiraling for days?

Has anyone navigated mixed signals—especially across cultural lines—without losing their mind? I’d love your war stories, coping strategies, and sanity-saving tips. Thanks for listening 🙏

1kxvn4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/language_exchange/comments/1kxvn4n/offering_english_seeking_spanish/,"Offering English, Seeking Spanish","Helloooo--

I'm Ethan, a 21M native speaker in Connecticut (New York City, basically). I studied Spanish and French in college, but I focused primarily on written translation. I just started a job at a law firm that is looking for Spanish speakers, and I want to help them with Spanish clients. But since I'm a lot weaker at listening and speaking than reading and writing, I wanna put in some extra work before I risk jeopardizing a case over poor communication.

A little bit about me: I enjoy creative writing quite a bit, and spent the past three years as a magazine editor before my current job. If you need more technical explanations of English grammar, chances are I can probably help, since correcting that stuff was what I did for most of my work. I don't edit much now, but I do a lot of short fiction writing; I'd love for you to practice your reading with it (and maybe give me some feedback so I can get them publishing-ready...)

Besides writing, I do some amateur music production. I also enjoy films and reading, and really anything creative. I have big aspirations to do something or make something that people will really respect, so I'm always looking for new creative perspectives or even partners in creating things. I also drink a metric fuckton of coffee and take it very seriously, since I used to work at a specialty coffee roaster.

We can talk over Discord or Whatsapp or really whatever, I'm not picky. I'm interested in any and all dialects; I just want someone I can talk with and practice my listening. We can exchange audio clips back and forth in English and Spanish, and maybe even call sometimes if our schedules line up.

Hope to speak with some of you!

Within 30 min of the edible I got a SEVERE dry throat only on the right side. Not even water could quench my thirst. I swear I drank a gallon of water in an hour just trying to quench it. Ever since.. it’s still here! Only on the right side. No pain. Just irritation that it feels like a dry patch right behind/underneath my tonsil. 

So I went to ENT.. he said it looked a little irritated but nothing was there. He sent a swab in. Negative. He told me to try things for GERD. Went on a PPI.. changed my diet but I’m already extremely healthy. Plant based. BMI of 19. Exercise everyday. Active. Don’t drink alcohol, coffee, or caffeine. And due to canker sores I can’t eat chocolate SO I never ate or drank any GERD “triggers” to begin with. 

I am at a loss for what to do.. next step is an endoscopy, but I feel like they’re already going to tell me nothing is wrong..

Ten-Thousand Years Ago...

They were lucky Earth was a relatively underdeveloped planet. There were beings of intelligence, yes, but none on the scale that would notice the carnage around them as anything more than a staple of a planet they had yet to fully understand. It must be nice.

Zordon almost laughed at the cosmic joke of the most famous artifact in existence, the Zeo Crystal, being hidden on such a barren planet. But, then again, he guessed that was the point. No one with any sense would think to look here for it and it could rest for eternity, becoming more of a myth and legend than it currently was.

In his youth, Zordon would have been thrilled to discover the Zeo Crystal. He fancied himself something of a treasure hunter and that lusting of something greater than himself led to his friendship with Zedd, their time at the Academy, and their position as Power Rangers.

It was supposed to be the ultimate peacekeeping job. He would travel to other planets. Interact with other beings. Explore other cultures. And, most importantly, protect the innocent from the forces of evil.

He wasn't supposed to be dying in some desolate world betrayed by those he had once trained to carry on his legacy.

He supposed he could blame Zedd. The man had been charismatic and gregarious in ways Zordon could only imagine. Zedd was just as clever as Zordon, but more open to his emotions. And it was that openness that ate at him with every evil they encountered, every burned city they discovered, and every child they failed to save.

Zordon could even blame Rita. She showed all the capabilities of being a leader and was given the second-in-command green armor as recognition of his fact. But she was too easily manipulated. Too swayed by Zedd's poisoned words and the promises of a never ending love and access to magic she could only dream about as a child when she was hiding from her tyrannical father

Goldar was just a monster. A thuggish brute who spoke only violence and revealed sociopathy. He should have never been given the yellow armor, even if his strength was greater than any Zordon had seen before.

But, truly, Zordon could only blame himself. He wasn't fast enough, wasn't strong enough, to stop Zedd. And maybe he didn't want to. For all his faults, Zedd only wanted to save the world from evil. Zordon wasn't sure Zedd realized he was becoming that very evil until it corrupted him completely.

He was pulled from his musings, surprised to find himself being dragged into the very base they had set up when they first came to Earth. The only one left, the young scientist from Edenoi wearing the blue armor, was using what was left of his strength to drag Zordon through their Command Center. Zordon was impressed with the young man. Even with injuries as grave as he had, he was willing to save his captain first.

""We did it, Zordon,"" the young man said as he placed Zordon in the stasis tube at the center of their base. It would keep Zordon alive, but as a half-life. He would be nothing more than a projection on a screen, his conscious speaking to the room through a hologram.

""Don't fight this, Zordon,"" the young man continued. ""I know, but this will keep you alive until I can find the Zeo Crystal.""

""And your injuries, my friend?"" Zordon wheezed out.

""I'm good with robotics.""

""That price is too severe.""

""Aye Yai Yai. Keeping you alive is the best hope. Rita is sealed and Zedd is in the wind, but they both may be back one day. This planet will one day need the Power Rangers and the Power Rangers need Zordon. I did the calculations. This is our best hope.""

Chapter 1
Angel Grove, California	Present Day

The Six Harmonies had been drilled into Peter Liu's head since his fifth birthday, the day his grandfather began training him Xing Yi Quan. Three external harmonies: wrist-ankle, elbows-knees, shoulders-hips. Three internal harmonies: your spirit harmonizes with your intention, your intention harmonizes with your breath, your breath harmonizes with your physical movement. It taught about physical posture, yes, but also about keeping yourself in balance with the world around you.

Peter made sure to keep himself in balance every day. As a second-generation American, grandson of immigrants from Luoyang, he knew the value of hard work. His grandfather has used his impressive strength to become a construction foreman. His father had translated his love of crafting to opening a successful carpentry store. And Peter, the first of the men in his family with a chance of higher education, was supposed to take over the business and expand it in ways his father could only dream about.

It was daunting and kept Peter pressured to maintain his perfect grades and excellent relationship with his teachers despite only being a sophomore and having just turned sixteen merely a week ago.

He wished he could slack off occasionally like the rest of his grade, but Peter wouldn't allow himself to fail. He wanted nothing more than to succeed and pay his parents back for all of their sacrifices.

He glanced to the desk at his left and smiled briefly at the sleeping form of his best friend, James Kilbane.

Peter and James, or Jamie as he preferred to be called, were as different as night and day. Peter was well-kept, extraordinarily polite, and straight-forward in his interactions with everyone. Jamie was more... messy. Not in appearance, but in personality. His best friend was flippant with everyone and made up for his short stature with a sarcastic comment ready for every scenario.

Jamie's head was propped up by his hand, and to most it seemed like he was listening like the rest of the class. But, Peter knew better, and so did one other in the room.

""Mr. Kilbane,"" the shrill voice of their teacher, Ms. Appleby called out. ""Since you found the time to sleep in my class, that must mean you already know about our country's space explorations. Would you tell the class about the first mission to the Moon?""

Jamie opened one bleary eye and scratched at the collar of his black Get The Knack t-shirt, before sighing out his answer in a sleep-filled voice. ""The first mission to the Moon, or Apollo 11, was launched on July 16, 1969, completed by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.""

Ms. Appleby gave Jamie a look that was somewhere between impressed and outright irritation. ""If you only managed to pay attention in class, you'd be one of the top students in the grade. As it stands now, detention after school.""

""Save me the window seat?"" Jamie mumbled with a roll of his eyes.

""Did you say something, Mr. Kilbane?"" Ms. Appleby returned with a clear warning in her voice.

Peter jabbed his best friend with his elbow before Jamie could open his mouth again and land in even more hot water.

Appleby returned to her lecture and Peter leaned over to whisper. ""If you keep answering questions correctly, Appleby will have a new favorite.""

""And replace Mr. Perfect?"" Jamie returned with a grin. ""Yeah, right.""

There was the truth about Jamie. He was not just another dime-a-dozen smart mouth slacker. He was effortlessly smart in a way that Peter, nor anybody else in the school, could ever truly match.

""Up all night song writing again?"" Peter prompted.

Jamie didn't respond, but nodded sleepily and let his head drop back into his hands. Peter was just happy that his eyes remained open.

And that was the other truth. Jamie wasn't lazy and he wasn't a slacker. His grades could be better, but only because he could have skipped a grade or three at some point in his education. Jamie just had other goals in mind and those goals were more pressing to him than Biology or Algebra or History.

The bell mercifully rang and the boys rose from their seats.

""I know you have this John Lennon fantasy in your head, but I think even he needed to graduate from high school. Everyone needs a fallback,"" Peter continued as both boys moved toward their lockers in the sophomore hallway.

""Lennon was basically kicked out of Quarry Banks and sent to an art college because the school didn't know how to handle him,"" Jamie replied with a pointed look.

""I just don't want to see you lost if music doesn't work out.""

""I appreciate the concern, mom,"" came the snide reply, but Peter could tell there was hardly any malice behind it.

The two boys were silent for a moment before they reached their lockers, Peter taking a moment to drop his books and red bomber jacket inside.

""Hey Pete, Jaime.""

The sudden greeting made both boys jump in surprise, the decidedly feminine voice belonging to their friend, a currently smirking Melody Vásquez.

""I know the wannabe rockstar is usually out of it, but you've always got your head on a swivel Pete. What's going on?""

""Our baby boy got detention from Appleby again,"" replied Pete, hoping that his blush wasn't noticeable to either of his friends. Melody just seemed to bring out the reaction in him.

""Fell asleep again?"" Melody asked Jamie, hovering like a mother hen only only to adjust the strap of his tote bag with her hand hidden inside her fuzzy, yellow sweater.

Jamie brushed her hand off, pouting. ""I just stayed awake writing a song. It's for my art. I'm sure you get that Mel.""

""Sure, I get sacrificing for your art. But, not at the expense of the rest of your life,"" Melody shrugged. ""I'm even looking for graphic design scholarships to support my painting.""

""Scholarships?"" Jamie ruefully smiled. ""A plan for my future? You sound like my parents.""

""Yes,"" answered Pete, slinging his arm around the smaller boy. ""God forbid we make sure you don't lose yourself in your notions of tortured romance. How dare we.""

...

Wyatt Cirillo smiled as he pulled out his phone and began recording. Holding the phone at arm's length, he turned the screen to himself and put on his best influencer voice.

""Okay, Kaylee, if you can shave another three-tenths off your time, you'll not only pass the record for Angel Grove, but Southern California as well. And, if not, I'll get some great footage for my channel.""

Wyatt Cirillo couldn't help but chuckle at the glare his best friend, Kaylee Jones, threw his way. They both knew he wouldn't post anything, but the threat alone was enough to take her mind off of failing for the moment.

He turned the phone onto the girl, who gave him an unamused glance. ""Seriously, Wyatt? You know how I feel about being filmed.""

Wyatt chuckled and in a mocking voice, turned his phone back on him. ""Sorry viewers, it seems like Kaylee would prefer her attempts be made in secret. Don't fear, though, I'll let you all know if she's able to complete the challenge on our next exciting episode of Cirillo's Challenge. For now, this is Wyatt Cirillo signing off.""

Wyatt shut his phone off, placing it back in his pocket. He should have known better than to film Kaylee. She could perform well under the most extreme pressure... until someone told her that she was being watched.

Wyatt, on the other hand, relished the spotlight. He had a rapidly growing Youtube Channel and an expanding Instagram account where he could post his tech reviews, computer builds, and just daily vlogs chronicling life in small town California. It seemed surreal to him that he lived just an hour away from Los Angeles, but you could never tell from looking at the sleepy little town of Angel Grove.

Kaylee had her way out. She was almost guaranteed to get a track scholarship. Wyatt, who admittedly didn't have an athletic bone in his body, needed to be more creative. Thus, the internet presence. In this day and age, the internet was the best way to get noticed. And Wyatt was good with computers, great, really, and understood the internet better than almost anyone in town.

""Seriously, Kay, you need to chill. I'll skip History every day with you until you break this record, but at the rate you're going it will lead to a heart attack. Take a breath and get some water.""

Wyatt undid the top button of his blue checkered shirt. It was louder than anything his classmates would wear, but he liked standing out. He spared a glance over to Kaylee, who was in the middle of stretching. She naturally stood out, with her deep brown eyes and flawless dark skin. She was the beauty of the class for sure. Wyatt's own heritage gave him a deeper olive skin tone, and his mother's auburn hair, and he thought he looked fine.

Kaylee finally stops and heads to the bleachers, Wyatt following behind. He watches with concern until he knows she's drained the last drop of water from her pink bottle before he finally joins her.

""You're right,"" she eventually replies. ""It won't do me any good if I collapse before the meet, but I see his picture in the trophy case and I just push myself harder.""

Wyatt shrugged. ""No problem. If anything, this will be great for my project.""

Kaylee raised an eyebrow. ""School project?""

""Nope,"" replied Wyatt, popping the ""p"" for emphasis. ""Advertising. All your track gear is branded and I'm hoping the company will notice. I have a huge gamer following right now, and those companies are always looking to break into that market. Soon, I'll be one of the top influencers and get interviews with all the cute gamer boys I follow.""

He sticks his tongue out at her and she playfully punches his shoulder, both laughing in amusement.

""I'm glad you both find this so funny,"" comes the stern voice of Mr. Caplan, the aging principal. "" You know that the track is not to be used without adult supervision. I hope you'll get the same amusement out of detention.""

...

Peter, Jaime, and Melody took their usual spot at one of the outdoor tables that littered the school ground.

While Peter reviewed some math notes and Melody sketched while sipping on an iced tea, Jamie strummed on the acoustic guitar he carried with him everywhere. Today, he was in cover mode, performing a version of ""I've Just Seen A Face"" that had many of the girls at the surrounding tables, even some of the older ones, swooning.

Not that Jamie would ever notice, though, as his eyes were drawn to Kaylee Jones as she sat at the popular table with her best friend, Wyatt.

""You know,"" Peter began with a wide smile. ""I bet if you moved closer to her, Kaylee might notice that you sing all your songs for her.""

Jamie scowled, and stopped playing, nodding in the direction of their friend. ""And Melody would be more inclined to see you as an option if you stopped blushing whenever she spoke.""

This time it was Peter who scowled, checking to make sure Melody was still in her own little world and not paying attention to their conversation. ""Truce?""

Jamie smiled and nodded, strumming again.

""Don't you have a coffee shop you can bother with your shitty Beach Boys covers?""

Peter didn't even need to look up to know that it was Farkas Bulkmeier speaking. Known as Bulk to the rest of the school, he was six and half feet of pure muscle and mullet. The new rising star of the high school wrestling world wore a letter jacket and the expression he saved for bullying particularly helpless students.

Behind him, in both his literal and figurative shadow, Eugene Skullovitch or Skull looked like he wanted to be anywhere else. He was on the smaller side, skinny, and wearing a ripped Team Skull Beanie down so far that it cast a shadow over his eyes. From the headphones he wore around his neck, Pete could hear the faint sounds of Richard Hell's ""Blank Generation"" playing.

Jamie, not one to miss mouthing off even against such a large opponent, put his guitar to the side and leveled Bulk with an even stare. ""I understand that anything beyond the sounds of cavemen grunting is above your comprehension, Bulk, but I would at least hope you knew the difference between the Beach Boys and the Beatles.""

Bulk scoffed. ""Who cares about some bands from ninety years ago?""

""Yeah, the most influential band in history. Who cares at all?"" Jamie replied with a sigh.

Bulk looked confused for a moment. ""That's what I just said. Don't think you'll escape a beating just because you start agreeing with me now.""

Both Peter and Melody burst out laughing, and even Skull chuckled a bit. But Jamie didn't do anything more than rise from his seat and stare up at the bully.

""That was sarcasm, Bulk. Can you spell it?""

""You mocking me?""

""No, Bulk,"" Jamie replied with an eye roll. ""Why would I do that?""

Both enraged and embarrassed, the bully cocked a fist back and prepared to strike the young musician. Peter reacted first, however, and grabbed the fist on its incoming trajectory, holding it in place and stopping Bulk's momentum.

""I wouldn't do that again if I were you, Bulk.""

""You think I'm scared of a little Kung Fu, Liu?"" I'll rip you in half and then deal with your snarky pal.""

Peter didn't rise to the bait, instead stepping back from the bully and folding his arms across his chest in satisfaction. Jamie, who caught on quickly as well, smiled. Skull, observant as well, jumped back from his friend and pulled his headphones over his ears to drown out what he knew was coming.

""You know, Bulk, people hear that I know martial arts and assume I'm the one they should be worried about. Truth is, I'm the easier option.""

""Yeah,"" Bulk asked with a raised eyebrow, pushing Peter back with a shove. ""How easy of an option?""

Peter stepped to the side and avoided the next of Bulk's shoves. He was prepared for the larger boy to strike again and he would counter with a simple block, but he never got the chance. As Bulk turned to attack, Melody stepped onto the table and poured the contents of her iced tea on Bulk's head.

Bulk stood still for a moment, the iced tea dripping off him in a constant pattern, before bellowing in rage. ""You bitch!""

The primal scream alerted the rest of the cafeteria to the current fight, including the acting lunch monitor Ms. Appleby.

""Mr. Bulkmeier, that kind of language is inexcusable! And fighting at school, I'm disappointed in all of you! Detentions, All around. Each of you can join Mr. Kilbane after school and think about your actions!""

From behind, there was a loud thunder boom, and the sky turned an inky black. But, as quickly as it happened, the sky returned to its normal shade and the students turned their questioning gazes toward each other.

...

Peter matched the rhythm of the clock as he stared up at it. Detention had only started ten minutes ago and he was already over it. Sure, the noise was loud enough to be annoying, but the detention monitor didn't notice and Peter was just petty enough to hope that it was grating on Bulk's nerves.

Next to him, Jamie wrote furiously in his notebook hidden behind a literature compendium Peter was sure Jamie had never needed to open in his life.. From what Peter could gather when he glanced over, it was some kind of poem about Jaime's childhood. Peter could almost hear the minor chords played from Jamie's Rickenbacker that he got last year for Christmas and hadn't put down since.

Behind the two of them, Melody lost herself in some sketch of the tree outside and a family of robins nesting within. She would occasionally glance at the clock, but only briefly before she returned to the world she was creating.

The other two, Wyatt and Kaylee, were back in the corner, heads ducked together and over Wyatt's phone. Both had their science books out and they were both quiet enough that the detention monitor Mr. Wilson would never notice and issue a warning.

Peter didn't care enough to figure out what Bulk and Skull were doing.

""Attention, all staff to the front office. All staff to the front office.""

""Shit,"" Mr. Wilson mumbled to himself, standing up and smoothing down his wrinkled button-up. ""I'll be back in a minute. Just don't do anything that would make us spend time together tomorrow.""

The door to the detention room had barely closed, when a paper ball hit Peter in the back of the head.

""Don't think I'd forgotten about you, Liu. Your ass is mine when detention is over,"" Bulk growled, flexing his right bicep for good measure.

""His ass is yours?"" exclaimed Wyatt in faux-surprise, holding a hand up to his chest. ""I guess the rumors about the two of us are true, Bulk.""

A sound like a mix between a choke and a guffaw escaped Skull's mouth, only for the skinny boy to cower in his chair when Bulk turned a threatening eye toward him.

Wyatt glanced up at the door for a second, and dragging Kaylee with him, took the seats in front of Peter and Jamie.

""Peter Liu, James Kilbane, Melody Vásquez,"" he smiled. ""Standing up to the local neanderthals? I love it.""

""You know us. We stand for truth, justice, and the American way,"" Jamie responded with a wry grin.

""And funny too?"" Wyatt chuckled. ""Kaylee, I believe we hit the friend jackpot.""

""Don't mind Wyatt,"" Kaylee interjected with a frown. ""He adopts people because his parents never let him get a dog when he was a kid.""

Wyatt waved her off. ""That may be true, but I need to know everything about your life. Come with us to Starbucks when detention is over.""

It sounded more like a command than a question to Peter and he was going to refuse the offer, but Melody already pulled a face at the mention of the chain store.

""What?"" Kaylee responded. ""I've seen you drink coffee at lunch.""

""Yes, but Melody works at Paxton's on 5th Street. Starbucks is her mortal enemy,"" Peter defused with an easy smile, wrapping an arm around Melody who mumbled something about worker's rights and fair trade practices.

""I've seen that place,"" Wyatt exclaimed, bouncing in his seat. ""It's got such a cute coffee house vibe. Total Central Perk feel.""

""Do we get a say in any of this?"" queried Jamie as he lowered his head against his arms. Peter could hear the exhaustion in the other boy's voice.

""Nope,"" Wyatt replied with a smile. ""And you need the caffeine anyway. You're practically falling asleep standing up.""

The first sound to permeate the conversation was that of screeching tires and sirens blasting through the downtown portion of the street. The little used air raid siren in the center of town, a left over from the Cold War, went off next. Nothing else could be heard for a few moments until screams in the distance and the faint sound of crackling gun fire.

""What, the cops finally have something to bust other than pot smoking teens?"" Bulk asked with a derisive sniff as he looked toward the window.

""Well, you and Skull are in here, Bulk,"" Melody responded. ""Still, though, what's going on outside?""

Wyatt was the first to reach for his phone, scrolling for a moment before dropping the device in shock. ""Holy shit! That can't be right.""

Kaylee snatched the phone from Wyatt's desk and scoffed. ""Unknown enemies attack a small California town? Where did you find this, Wyatt?""

""That's from the Associated Press wires.""

""They're not the only ones,"" Peter responded, having dug his own phone out in the chaos. ""The L.A. Times is running it online as well. From what they're reporting, an unidentified airship landed just outside town around two. Since then, a small army of what look like gray men embarked from the ship led by a large figure with golden armor. All attempts to contact the ship have failed and when approached, they got hostile. The Airforce and National Guard are on the scene now. All residents are being advised to stay in their locations and to wait for evacuations to begin.""

""Gray men?"" Bulk gulped. He too pulled out his phone and played a video. ""This is nuts! These guys are tanking the literal military. I'm out of here!""

Before he even finished his statement, Bulk was out of his seat and running down the hall, Skull hot on his heels.

Wyatt pulled his phone from Kaylee and found the same footage that made Bulk panic. The gray men, whatever they were, took a barrage of bullets and kept coming. One made it as far as a tank before lifting the vehicle off the ground and flipping it as if it weighed less than an average stone. The video pulled back to the center of the invading forces before focusing on the larger figure in the golden armor. Whatever it was, it turned to the camera and a jet of fire spewed from its mouth, cutting the video feed and leaving the teens stunned.

""It can't be aliens, right?"" Kaylee asked with a fearful glance at the window. ""There's no such thing.""

""Whatever they are,"" Jamie said, rising from his seat. ""It's probably why Mr. Wilson was called to the office. They're not trying to panic us or the kids still here in club activities.""

""So? What do we do now?"" Peter asked. As he finished his question, there was another whip-like crack of thunder and the room went white.

I'm wondering if anyone has advice on which espresso machine might do the trick for some gourmet hot chocolate making at home, because I've tried the cheap standalone milk frothers and to be honest, they're not cutting it. Love to hear the experts' advice! Not sure if I need the espresso machine with the bells and whistles or if there's one (or a certain feature) that will cut the mustard on cocoa. From what I understand, I think I need hot water and hot textured milk.

I'd like to stick to under $300 if possible (I feel ridiculous even saying that -- $300 for something that you can technically make in a microwave? But gross) but if that's not possible, give it to me straight. I don't want yet another one that doesn't scratch my itch. ",1,1748473573.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Also, any advice on choosing the first book and deciding on a meeting location? Should I start broad with a popular genre or be more niche to attract a specific interest group?

It could be a very bad idea.

So I feel like I can't leave him anywhere but strapped into the high chair even to go to the toilet. Obviously he can't spend long periods in the chair so 99% of my day is following him around. To make matters worse he is a contact napper. I feel like this is only going to get worse as he starts to learn to walk and climb up onto furniture. Am I missing something?

If I was stranded in an island and had to listen to only one band, I’d bring btbam just because of the pure depth of the music. You can have a different experience every time you listen to 

So enough of the circle jerk, I know plenty of people who would immediately dismiss them because of the vocals. I think getting someone past that is key because in the end you realize Tommy needs to have that style (or multiple styles for that matter) in order to stand out and distinguish himself from the rest of the music but still fit in. Wait wtf how am I circle jerking again?

So I have one chance - what song am I realistically sitting them down and forcing them to listen to the whole song knowing the immediate reaction is going to be negative, but they end up getting it at the end and go, “that’s cool”",10,1748473151.0,BetweenTheBuriedAndMe,22,0.86,False
