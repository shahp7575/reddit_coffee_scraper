1mw3btg,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1mw3btg/4night_westfjords_northern_iceland_2_nights/,4-Night Westfjords & Northern Iceland & 2 Nights Reykjavik Itinerary (late August),"Hello everyone, I've been reading a lot of itineraries posted on this sub and have created an itinerary for an upcoming trip to Iceland. This trip is focus on hiking and photography.

I have some questions about my itinerary. 

Thank you in advance.

**Questions:**

1. late August I'm assuming most of the puffins will be gone. Is Látrabjarg still worth the trek without puffins? 

2. Which town is better for 2 nights Patreksfjörður or Bildudalur?

3. I feel as if I should spend more time in and around Ísafjörður. Is it a difficult drive from Látrabjarg Cliff to Ísafjörður? I'm considering spending the night in Ísafjörður on day 03.

4. Should I skip Akureyri and spend more time around Ísafjörður? I know 2 1/2 days in Westfjords is not enough. I'm considering modifying my itinerary to eliminate the Akureyri segment and spend more time in Westfjords.

5. Driving times, I've added 35% to the times given on Google Map. I've read on some posts I should double the driving times given by Google Map.

It's a time when sisters pray for their brothers’ well-being, and in return, brothers promise to protect and cherish their sisters.

If your brother or sister loves curating elegant spaces, gifting them something that enhances their **home décor** is a thoughtful and timeless choice. Instead of the usual sweets and accessories, why not surprise them with something that reflects their personality and adds charm to their living space? Whether they adore minimalist design, boho accents, or vintage-inspired aesthetics, these handpicked ideas offer a blend of style and sentiment. Here are **10 unique Bhai Dooj gift ideas**—each chic, meaningful, and perfect for elevating interiors.

# 1. Designer Table Lamps for Bedroom

https://preview.redd.it/lhepij41ebkf1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c662f937274175dee325e9702c99dd99053761c

Nothing transforms a bedroom's ambiance like soft, warm lighting. Consider gifting a sleek, sculpted [**table lamp for the bedroom**](https://www.whisperinghomes.com/lamps/table-lamp) with a statement base—perhaps in ceramic or marble with a fabric shade. It adds both functionality and charm, ideal for cozy late-night chats or reading sessions.

# 2. Artistic Decorative Vases

https://preview.redd.it/jol1wl42ebkf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d62e7fe404f281340ea83d7aa9cfd006343ad217

A stunning [**decorative vase**](https://www.whisperinghomes.com/home-decor-products/vases) can become the focal point of any room. Opt for handcrafted glass or brass vases in vibrant colors, unusual shapes, or metallic finishes. Fill with fresh blooms or minimalist branches for an instant style upgrade.

# 3. Elegant Wall Décor

Wall art brings personality to any space. For something personal, choose customizable wall décor—such as painted metal panels, mixed-media prints, or woven wall baskets. Even a chic monogram or framed sibling photo can add heartfelt value and visual intrigue.

# 4. Charming Candle Holders



Candle holders evoke mood and warmth. Look for brass or glass holders with intricate detailing, or modern geometric styles with matte finishes. Pair with scented or decorative candles for a glowing, relaxing ambiance during celebratory evenings.

# 5. Fresh & Artistic Flower Bouquet

https://preview.redd.it/42uzu3a3ebkf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6b088a3357ed6da93ee0f2451eb3eddd812da01

Nothing brightens a space quite like a well-arranged [**flower bouquet**](https://www.whisperinghomes.com/dry-grass-flowers/flower-bunch). Whether it’s a bunch of roses, tulips, or seasonal blooms, flowers add instant charm and warmth. You can elevate the gift further by choosing an arrangement in a stylish vase—creating a dual-purpose décor item that looks beautiful on dining tables, coffee corners, or bedside consoles.



# 6. Cozy Set of Dried Flowers

Dried flower arrangements are timeless and maintenance-free. A delicate bouquet of pampas grasses, sola flowers, or dried stems suits both modern and rustic interiors. It's a gift that blooms indefinitely and adds natural texture to any room.

# 7. Elegant Picture Lights



https://preview.redd.it/f6wux9n4fbkf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=63d4c64d16133f5c6d0e8930ab28b4d4ccd3e692

For siblings who love galleries or showcasing memories, a [**picture light**](https://www.whisperinghomes.com/picture-wall-lights) is perfect. These wall-mounted lights spotlight cherished photos or artwork—adding depth and sophistication to their display.

# 8. Heartfelt Handmade Cards

https://preview.redd.it/3pqf54h4ebkf1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f24484a2c75cc6200c042c748b2fc2297b1fd922

Sometimes, the most meaningful gift is a simple, heartfelt message. A beautifully crafted [**handmade card**](https://www.whisperinghomes.com/dry-grass-flowers/flower-bunch/dried-flower-handmade-cards) expressing your love and memories shared with your sibling adds a personal touch to any Bhai Dooj gift. Pair it with a small décor piece like a candle holder or **dried flower** bouquet to create a thoughtful keepsake they’ll treasure forever.

# 9. Statement Centerpiece Bowl

An artful bowl or tray can anchor dining tables or entryways. Choose a brass curli bowl, stoneware dish, or contemporary tray with ethnic motifs. Leave empty or let them style it with potpourri, floating candles, or decorative orbs.

# 10. Personalized Wall Basket Décor

https://preview.redd.it/rzkqoz65ebkf1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdc99a97addfed23f572497efa61c2cf3a40934e

* **Functional Beauty** – Gifts like picture lights and candle holders don’t just look good—they serve a purpose.  
* **Effortlessly Stylish** – Items like dried flowers and wall baskets add flair without requiring upkeep.  
* **Personal & Memorable** – Custom or meaningful décor pieces create lasting emotional resonance.  

# How to Pick the Perfect Décor Gift

1. **Know Their Aesthetic**: Are they minimalist, boho, traditional, or modern? Choose décor that complements their style.  
2. **Think of the Space**: Does their home need soft lighting, wall accents, or a romantic glow? Select accordingly.  
3. **Add a Personal Twist**: Engrave their initials on a vase, choose their favorite tone, or include a note explaining why it reminds you of them.  
4. **Pack Thoughtfully**: Beautiful presentations (ribbons, gift wrapping, a handwritten card) make décor gifts feel even more special.  

# Wrapping Up

1mw36up,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mw36up,Lofoten Long Crossing / Norway – most adventurous thru-hike of our life (Review and tips),"**Lofoten Long Crossing – most adventurous thru-hike of our life**

After the Corfu Trail and the GR221, it was about time to level up our long-distance hiking game.  
My wife and I both had company holidays during the first two weeks of August, which seemed to be the perfect period for the Lofoten Long Crossing. 11 Stages, 15-18km every day, 500-+1000m change in elevation per day, extreme landscape.  
To get there, a bit of planning needed to be done – we took the train to the next airport, flew to Oslo, caught another plane to Bodø, stayed there for one night, and took the first ferry to Moskenes on the Lofoten archipelago the next morning.  
At 11:00, the ferry docked and we were ready to hike from south to north.

Our first five days were self-supported, which added 3.5 kg of food to our backpacks. We tried to stay as light as possible and really only took what seemed necessary (I used every single item in my backpack except the gloves – detailed list will follow).  
Backpacks weighed around 13–15 kg at most, but got lighter day by day. Luckily, you don’t need to bring a lot of water since it’s available everywhere.

The first day already made pretty clear that we were not supposed to underestimate what was ahead of us. We hadn’t expected the terrain to be as steep as it was in some sections (even as Austrians, used to big mountains). The trails are not marked and not well maintained (or not maintained at all) – it’s the perfect adventure.

Nevertheless, we quickly adapted to the difficulties of the trail, developed our trail legs and found our pace. There are stunning views literally around every corner. At first you can’t even comprehend what’s going on… spiky steep peaks, crystal-clear lakes, hardly any vegetation or wildlife at all – just plain rock, grass, bushes and moss.

We were lucky with the weather for the first two days, but unfortunately a bad weather period with rain and strong winds was about to start. After the 4th day of hiking we were forced to take two days off and pitched our tent at a campsite (Ramberg) because the rain was crazy and winds reached up to 70 km/h, which made it unsafe to continue.

After the break, we skipped the sections we had lost, because one of them required a lot of road walking anyway, so it wasn’t too bad.  
Back on the trail it still rained for a couple of hours per day, but we got used to it and also had sunny periods. *Embrace the wet* became our mantra.  
The rain also turned the trail into a boggy mess. Sometimes we were ankle-deep in mud for kilometre after kilometre… but still, you get used to it because everything else is so stunning, and by this point we had developed a huge sense of adventure.

We hiked for another three days, camped at the most beautiful locations, but also had to seek shelter from a storm in a small forest – otherwise our tent would have been ripped apart.  
Day 9 on trail brought heavy rain and winds again. At some point the trail turned into a little creek. We looked at each other and we both knew it was over. We hiked 10 km out to the next road and cell phone reception, booked an apartment on the shore, and hitchhiked 25 km into the next town, where we stayed 3 nights until it was time to get home.

 

* Were we disappointed not to finish? – Yes.
* Did we discuss our decision several times? – Yes.
* Was it the most adventurous thing we’ve ever done together? – 100%
* Would I recommend doing it? To each and everyone!

 

There is one thing you can’t control – and that’s the weather. Weather is king!

We are not regretting a single minute on the trail and it did something to us, I can´t fully name yet but it´s good!

 

 

**Tips for the Long Crossing:**

* Due to rainy, boggy and wet conditions I would **NOT** recommend trail runners. Boots were the better choice.
* Bring a water filter – even tho the water is clear, there is sheep poo everywhere.
* Real Turmat freeze-dried meals are really good, we tried them all. Try Rendeer Stew
* Use a pack liner – rain covers will NOT keep the inside of your backpack dry after several hours or days of rain.
* Keep your camp clothes as dry as possible and bring warm enough layers. Putting on the puffy at the end of the day felt amazing every single time.
* Talk to other hikers about the trail – we got plenty of useful information.
* Eat stockfish.
* Bring all your tent stakes and pitch your tent well – high winds can occur anytime.
* Eat a lot and bring sweets for mental support.
* Your rain jacket will not stay dry – embrace it.
* Norwegian people are really, really friendly. Ask and they will help you (for example, we were allowed to dry our tent in the basement of a campsite).
* Most ferries are free if you’re a pedestrian… and I love boat rides.
* Besides the popular trails there are not many people. Solitude is beautiful.
* Hiking poles were essential for us, especially on boggy terrain and descents.
* Plan more days than there are stages… rest days or forced breaks need to be taken into account.
* Hitchhike roadsections – we hitchhiked 4 times and every single time someone picked us up in less than 5 minutes.
* Avoid walking on the E10 or on bridges – it’s busy and not pleasant without a pedestrian walk.
* Stop and turn around every once in a while – the views change so quickly.
* Don’t get intimidated by other hikers who may be faster or handle difficult terrain better. It’s your hike, it’s your pace.
* There is a ferry from Svolvær to Skutvik and a fast boat to Bodø if you need to return from the northern part to the airport in Bodo.
* Make sure to visit the little café in Vindstad run by volunteers… real trail angels.
* Be kind to each other / your hiking partner – we both had a bad days eventually! Support is everything!
* Wind is your friend when it comes to drying your shoes and tent
* Clif Bars are the best
* Be careful when cooking after a long demanding day on the trail. Your concentration is low, I spilled my boiling water and in a desperate attempt to catch it, I burned a hole in my puffy
* Bring patches to fix your cloths
* Don’t trust the internet, not even me because for you the hike could be different as well.
* No bugs – zero mosquitos. Even tho one hiker told us about one stage where it was terrible.
* Put all your camp cloths and sleeping stuff (earplugs etc.) in the foot box of your sleeping bag, so you don´t have to gather everything together
* Use drybags
* No need for a headlamp in summer. It will not get completely dark
* Bring rain pants not just a rain jacket
* Norway is expensive
* Eat cloudberries – never tested anything close to it and they all along the trail, as well as blueberries.
* Aeropress makes good coffee and is not too heavy for the trail
* Keep your eyes open for sea eagles, they are beautiful
* A straight section of 2km on the map with no change in altitude can take you 2.5h (Forsfjord – Vindstad)
* Merino does the trick
* The MT100 Puffy Jacket from Decathlon is the best bang for your buck
* Prepare your own breakfast to safe money, get enough calories and something tasty in the morning (oatmeal, milkpowder, dried fruit, nuts, chocolate…)
* Switch your phone to flightmode – safes you battery and does not distract you from the beauty and the people around you
* Resupply is easily possible in Ramberg, Leknes and Svolvaer
* Get the reis app for public transport
* Get multiple weather forecast apps just to realize none of the is correct
* Make a lighterpack list even if you are not ultralight in any way, it just helps to get an overview and will help you to sort out. Lighter packs make a safer hike.
* We carried an Garmin Inreach Mini 2…the SOS button provides kind of a safer feeling
* Get a cheap and light foam mat. They are great for breaks, to put under your inflatable mat to give it some protection from the ground or just to lay out stuff on it and have a dry place. There is one from Decathlon that is 5€ and 150g.
* Make friends
* Have fun

How should I prep ""Season"" it before the first grind?","TL;DR: First manual grinder (Timemore C3s). Plan = wipe -> 15g fine + 15g coarse seasoning grind -> discard. Enough ""seasoning"" prep before first real brew?

Hey everyone,

Just got my very first manual grinder - the talk of the town and lord itself, the Timemore C3s.
Excited? 100%. Prepared? Maybe not quite. I just want to make sure I set it up properly before using it.

Since it’s factory-made with metal burrs, I assume there could be machining residue, oils, or other stuff left over from production. I’d rather play it safe than end up with off-flavors (or worse) in my first cup.

Here’s the plan I came up with after some digging:

Step 1: Disassemble and wipe with a dry brush/microfiber cloth (no water or at most a lightly damp cloth).

Step 2: Run two 15g grinds with cheap beans one at the finest setting, one at the coarsest and discard them.

Step 3: Brush it out again, then start for real.

My questions for the community:

Has anyone seen any instructions manual or videos on this?

Is 30g of seasoning beans enough, or should I run more (50–100g total)?

Any other words of wisdom to help the newbie?

Thanks in advance. May your next cup be smooth, flavorful, and worthy of the coffee gods 🙏☕",2,1755757010.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

The proprietor was frantically assisting a customer at the counter, taking orders over the phone, and simultaneously receiving a barrage of WhatsApp and instagram messages.

When he didn't receive a response quickly enough, one man actually left the store.

"" I'm not sure why, but I was struck hard by that moment. For this, big brands have chatbots and teams, but small business owners? ""

Every day they lose sales and are drowning. I kept thinking about it that night. So I got to work building.

In summary, following several restless nights and more coffee than I'd like to acknowledge, I developed a tool that enables small and medium-sized retailers to automate their customer chats.

Here's how it works:

Shop owners upload their own info (like product details, prices, FAQs).

The chatbot replies their way, based on that knowledge and tune set by owners.

Every chat is designed to actually convert into a sale, not just give robotic answers.

There’s a simple dashboard where they can track conversations, see analytics, and even jump in + edit chats if bot messes up.

Best part: it keeps learning from past convos, so it gets smarter over time.

To be honest, I'm still very new to this. But one store owner told me: ""I really did sleep well last night. Your bot even answered customers' questions for me and made a sale.""
That was honestly one of the best times I've ever had building something.

There are a few things I would like to ask this
group:

How do you balance building and marketing when you're just starting out?

Did you use any clever tricks to get your first 1000 users?

Still figuring things out, so any advice or experience you can share would mean a lot.

I've just built a new cycling app that creates great road routes with a single click. The goal? Fun, scenic rides — not just the shortest point A to point B.



**Here's how it works:**

1. Choose your distance (10–300 km) and whether it’s a loop or point-to-point.

2. (Optional) Pick a target elevation gain.

3. (Optional) Add sightseeing stops.

4. (Optional) Include natural springs to refill your bottles.



Hit ""Get Route"" — and the magic happens. You get a custom route, ready to ride.

It's free for now. If you like it, you can buy me a coffee, send brutally honest feedback, or even help out.



**Why it's different from Komoot or Strava**

The secret is the algorithm and the data. I've got 10+ years of experience in advanced algorithms, and over the past year I've been collecting, cleaning, and enhancing cycling data.

The result? Routes optimized specifically for road cyclists: less traffic, smoother tarmac, better scenery.



**The idea came from two frustrations:**

1. Planning routes is a time sink — especially checking traffic, road quality, and sights for a safe, pleasant ride.

2. I love discovering hidden gems while riding. But too often, they're just 100 meters off the path and I miss them. This app helps find them before I do.



If that sounds familiar, you'll probably love it too.

And if you find a critical bug, please report it — you'll be my hero.



**The future roadmap:**

\- Gravel & MTB support

\- Direct export to Garmin, Strava, and Komoot (GPX download already available)

\- Mobile apps

\- Your ideas here — what would you like to see?



**Try it out and tell me what you think:**

merely a viewpoint from an outsider to these incidents from my past. 

My Brother stole my car and tried again later but I stopped him. I was 24, he 19.

The similar backstory at the end occurred when I was 12. 

They told me I was selfish my entire life. What are your thoughts?



1st Car Theft Incident:

My Brother and I shared a 2 Bedroom Dwelling. 

One Saturday morning my Brother, His Girlfriend, and I made a pancake breakfast together and watched a movie in pj's. 

After breakfast I said I was going for a run, I left my wallet and keys in my room.

As I am returning from my jog roughly 2 hours later, I see my own car coming down the street and turn into my driveway 2-3 house lengths in front of me. 

(My brother has his own separate running, driving, capable vehicle. I gave it to him 3 months before this happened.)

I run into the driveway and watch my brother climbing out of the driver seat of my car, and make his way to open the passenger side for his girlfriend. 

Passenger door is open, girlfriend is mid-climb out. His right hand is on the door handle and my car keys in his left.

I grab my set of keys from his clutch and scream at the top of my lungs-

""GIVE ME MY CAR KEYS! YOU, (insert key yank and retrieval here),

DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO DRIVE MY CAR!!!""

I put the key fob up to eye level- his and my line of eye sight- and smack my own key ring twice with my right hand against the left.

""THAT'S NOT YOURS, YOU DON'T TOUCH IT!!""

(For clarity the car was purchased thru my credit union solely in my name, no co-sign, no financial down payment from anyone, not a 'passed-down' car. I bought myself a car with my name, my credit, my paycheck.)

I rushed inside, grabbed a shirt and my wallet, and drove off in my car- no other words or exchanges from me or him.  

Went and rented another apartment, and was moved out in 2 days.

Between the incident and move out I saw him twice. 

\-On the night it happened he said I should have waited until I calmed down and then come to him as a man instead of yelling at him. 

\-On the morning I moved out- He tried to stare a hole into my friends and me while we carried my belongings, the living room furniture, the TV, the food in the pantry out. He wouldn't speak, just starred at us and tried to get in the way of my friends twice. 

Once I left he sent me a text saying I was a coward that wouldn't face him.

  
2nd Car Theft Attempt Incident:

Fast forward about 8 months.

(For context: Our Dad was a daily smoker and drank coffee to suppress his appetite. If either my sister or I didn't text him and remind him to buy dinner for himself and my brother- it didn't happen. When living together, If I didn't feed my brother, or he couldn't pillage my leftovers, he went to my Dad's house across the street to rummage for food. My father has a capias warrant out during this specific window of time.)

After work, and before I headed to my apartment, I texted my Dad and asked if he or my brother had eaten, to which he said no. 

I stopped and picked them up some food, and gave my Dad a heads up I would drop it off. 

Pulled into the driveway, armed up the food, walked into my Dads. Hello, here's your dinner, goodbye, ect. (We don't have a loving relationship, a day of kindness is Dad allowing me to make eye contact.)

Quick in and out. 

I leave the house and walk out onto the driveway and see my drivers door open with a foot hanging out onto the pavement. My brother is sitting in the driver's seat. 

""Food is inside with Dad, Noah."" 

A quiet voice calls back ""I'm driving this.""

""Noah, I gotta go. Get out, come on.""

Calm voice answers ""Give me the keys, I'm driving this car.""

""Noah, get out of my car. I'm tired, I wanna go home. Your food's inside.""

He's white knuckling my steering wheel at 10 and 2, staring thru the windshield intently, left leg hanging out of the still open drivers door.

""No, I'm driving this. You can give me the keys so....... give me the keys.""

I pull my phone out and call my Dad twice. 

First time- I tell him what is happening, to which he tells me my car MUST be blocking my brothers in. After I explain that isn't the case and that I will not be letting this matter go, He begrudgingly mumbles over speakerphone for my brother to ""Stop"".

I hang up.

No movement.

""Come on.""

""NO!""

Call Dad back.

""... Dad, he will be getting out of my car. Either you get him out or I will have to get somebody here that will. It's not optional. I'm trying to give you the courtesy of calling you to handle this first.""

That is the most calm and polite way I can tell my Dad and my eavesdropping side-eyeing brother that I will be putting my foot down and am about to call the cops on him for the first time. 

Dad comes out into the driveway. Stares at me. Stares at my brother. 

I say ""Noah, get out of MY car.""

""NO! I get to DRIVE THIS!"".

My Dad is terrified of the police.  

""Dad, I am extending a courtesy to you that is about to expire. Get him out of my car.""

An awkward pause ensues and then silence is broken.

Dad- ""Noah, get out of that car.""

Never has my Dad stood up for me. 

Noah drops his mouth, shares a few glances back and fourth between me and my father, exhales deeply while exiting, slams my car door.

He stared at me like a swing would ensue and muttered a bunch of crap while he walked inside. My Dad stared at the ground, and I climbed into my car and left. 

The year or two after this happened I would cross paths with him at holidays or birthdays. 

He, nor my Dad, would ever address me directly, unless it was a random insult from across the room.  

He would try to find my car keys, wallet, something to steal and hide from me.

The last attempt he made was trying to stick his hand into my dress pants pocket to get my keys at Thanksgiving Dinner at my Aunts house. I smacked his hand in front of the room.

""Get your hand out of my pocket, you do NOT touch my car keys.""

""You can't hit me!""



Lastly- My first asserted purchase went similarly but ended worse. 



On my 12th Birthday my Aunt and Grandma blessed me with enough money to purchase a Silver Mongoose from Walmart.

My younger brothers, 8 and 5 years younger respectively, would steal anything not tied down from me. 

My Mom and Dad would say I should be happy to ""share"" with them.

""We bought all your stuff, everything you have is ours so you can share with your brothers. Until you buy your own stuff you have to share.""

My brother saw my new bike in the driveway and started screaming and yelling that he wanted to ride it. 

I said ""No.""

My Mom said ""No, you can share that with your brother.""

I said ""No. You said I had to share everything with him because you bought it. You said I had to share with him until I buy my own stuff. I bought that with my own birthday money. He's not riding it.""

I went out into the yard to get away from my Mom and her crocodile tears. I got on my new bike and started pedaling down the driveway. 

My shirt was yanked from behind and I fell into the grass, my bike pinning me to the ground, sideways under me.

I looked up to see my Dad pulling my bike from between my legs. He kicked grass at me, and proceeded to ride my bike up and down the driveway taunting me. 

""Loooook, I'm riding YOUR bike!!! HA HA HA HA HA!!""

""Dad, I bought that bike with my money.""

""I don't give a flying F#@K who paid for it! I own EVERYTHING you have!""

He proceeded to make grand gestures for my brothers to come and take their turns. 

My father and brothers rode my brand new bike on my birthday up and down the driveway in front of me while my Mom made me stand there and ""share"". 

My Dad punched me in the chest passing me and smirking

""Nothing's F@%king Yours"".

  


In the years that proceeded the car theft Incident My father and brothers proceeded to try and take my life. 



After that I changed my legal name, went no contact, and moved from Ohio to Texas alone to start over fresh. I don't talk to these people and never will again. 



  
Earlier this year I got 2 message requests from my brother, both of which I did not respond to. He said many things in the messages. The highlights are that he addressed me as ""GUY"" which is not my name, not a nickname ever been given to me. Didn't use my name, didn't call me anything I once answered to. Just ""GUY"". He called me a Coward yet again, said that our Dad was selfish and only did what served himself. He said he was drunk and missed me. He said I was waiting for an apology that he was now willing to give. He said nothing that stings.

I'm not sure what this kid wants from me, but since he was born he has insisted on standing beside me like a silent shadow anywhere I went, poking my sides, eating my food, stealing my favorite shirts, wearing my underwear, using my toothbrush if given the chance, and screaming that it isn't fair I get to live my life and he doesn't. 

He told me many times he was ""better at being me"" than I was. That more people thought he was funnier, taller, acted older, sang better, drove better. He said the only reason people could tell  us apart was because I had braces and he hadn't, to which he would then proceed to scream and try and strike or scratch me with his long nails. 

  
Part of my journey in healing has been to release these and other incidents from my life. Their attitudes were not mine to have to carry and I am tired of keeping this bottled inside of my mind.

Now I’m ok with black coffee most days, but the milk+ sugar craving still pokes me. I feel mess every day, setting up for Keto again.

On keto I had real benefits: body/neck pain and headaches basically vanished, mind felt calmer (I live alone, going through a separation), fasting sugar dropped from \~120 to around 75, A1c went down, sugar cravings disappeared, energy stayed steady for long hours, I could walk far without feeling dead. I even did OMAD for 4+ months — doable, but not easy.

I also messed up a bunch. Ate too much meat sometimes. Other times I stuffed myself with “keto-friendly” veg just to kill hunger and probably pushed carbs up. When I pushed protein high I felt extra body heat. I was sloppy with electrolytes too. After switching back to carbs I could feel the old stuff return — unrest, no peace, more irritation.

Now I want to go full keto again and keep carbs under 50 g/day, not just for weight loss but for how I feel overall.

I signed up to a writing course where I refined some of my work and now all I see in front of me is a collection of really deep, dark and depressing essays that stir up my victim complex sometimes when I read them. My teacher said its good material but I can't ascertain how truthful she's being.

Can I truly have a collection of essays that is this depressing? See an excerpt below and let me know your (brutally honest) thoughts. I guess I also feel a little deflated because I approached an agent who hasn't replied 3 months later. I know I know, its only one agent…

Pulpy excerpt 

It’s 3 am, and I’ve just discovered that my boyfriend has been sending inappropriate texts to his ex. I want to say that I missed the signs, that I was a victim of circumstance, but instead, I’m contemplating something more insidious: Was I secondarily liable for not confronting my reality in its entirety? If there truly is no smoke without fire, then when had I lit a match?

Every few months, I’d ask him: ""Why did you and her really break up?"" On the sofa, in bed, on sparse grass at the park, each time he said ""because I moved from Africa to Europe”, my spirit rejected it like bubbling stomach acid to oily takeaway. Familiar, unsettling. It’s almost as though I enjoyed provoking my body to react, indulging in the sensation of fear, and waiting for his scripted response to prompt
my scripted understanding of what happened. Everyone played their part.

His ex stole eight years of his life, and they supposedly ended things because of a European study visa and a sea that stretched out between them. This didn’t sit right with me because it suggested unfinished business. I know how deeply we both felt and loved, seismically so, so I struggled to see a reality where he wouldn’t fight for her until they both had bruises. I didn’t see any sign of his battle scars. Parts of their story felt wiped but my ego quietened me, basking in
the light of, “I’m special to him, that's why I can't imagine this reality"", shapeshifting to,
“everyone has a past, do I need to know?”, dimming to “what isn’t he telling me?”, and fizzling out with a bang for a cycle redo with “how are they so cleanly untangled? where are the roots?”

Yet, at the right time of the morning, when I dug deep enough into the soil, I’d feel
their stubborn, fibrous tendrils, sip my coffee, and listen to the birds.

But I’d earned this, and besides, intuition is formed of just the mind. Touch, his touch, was undeniable. His large, calloused hands had lived and their experienced embrace soothed me. I couldn’t trust the veiled subconscious that once had me checking locked doors and off stoves multiple times a night. Years of false starts triggered by survival mode, chemical imbalance, and the restructuring of my brain to complex PTSD eroded my trust in intuition. In mine. I couldn’t distinguish it from plain old insanity. Where does reality lie when yours has been permanently altered? 

And maybe as a result, here we are, in our
bedroom, circling each other in assessment.
The room smells of the cherry blossom candle he bought me, sickly sweet for our standoff. Our shadows dance on the wall while the faint smell of burnt rice cuts through the air.
“I won’t get angry, I promise,” I lie to him, softening my jaw. I notice hesitant body language and slow contemplation before he invites me to look at his screen. That’s when a coy confession dripping in self-pity joins us, first on his phone, then from his mouth.

“Thank you for showing me”, whether I’m whispering this to him or myself is unclear.
I don’t want to be here, going through this again. What is it about my molecules that demands this outcome? Why couldn’t I have walked this hallway to find the bolt latched in relief? Without a word, I stand to head to the balcony, looking back on our room and him, his head sunk in his lap. His shadow, a flickering boulder. 

I collapse on our balcony chairs, the metal cool
against my thighs through my pajamas. I'm immediately aware of a dirty white rag stuffed
between some piping up above. We live in a German Altbau with curved, ornate, high ceilings. Little carved cherubs are poised and laughing at me from above. I wonder who left this rag behind, what made them forget, and how I’d missed it after years of living here. I go from this to our brittle, decaying flowers and contemplate how much control we have over any of it: our intuition, what we notice, what happens to us, perishing.",2,1755756111.0,writers,4,1.0,False

To all the people I interacted with today, thank you. Even the ""bitey”one that made me cry. 


1. I asked you questions and brought you humor because I wanted to scratch the surface and ease your mind. 
You met me with a hug and a smile. Thank you for the dumb dad joke. 

2. I held the door because I saw that your hand were full and your small son was tired and cranky. 
You seemed so relieved to not have to fight him  or shift the weight of the baby in your arms. You have a beautiful smile. I see you, I know it’s thankless, but you’re doing it. 

3. I stopped traffic to let you cross the street. 
You smiled on the sidewalk and said thank you. I really appreciated that. You looked surprised when I told you to have a nice day. 

4. I left a plate of food next to you on the bench. 
Youre drunk and passed out. You didn’t say anything, you should take a shower when you can, maybe next time I’ll leave quarters for the harbor showers. I think I have a pair of hiking boots that will fit you. I’ll leave them here with your name on them. 

5. We sent pictures back and forth today and discussed deep feelings. You told me how much you missed your twin flame. 
I admire your love and admiration for them. It was nice to relate to someone who understands what it’s like to feel lost without the person they love. I see you. Thank you for seeing me and sharing. You have beautiful eyes and a creative soul. 

6. I shared pictures with you and you with me, we laughed , made dinner plans and then you stood me up to spend time with your boyfriend, I get it. I don’t blame you. 

7. We shared pictures and memes, I offered you dinner, and you declined respectfully, thank you for being there for me today. I was having a rough evening and you lightened it up a lot. 

8. I sent pictures and poked a couple jokes at ya, offered to bring you dinner and told I might be asleep but that my door was open if you needed anything. 
You scolded me about me needing validation from you and said you understood why my ex treated me the way he did. 
I was hurt. I didn’t like being misunderstood. I wondered if people have treated you that way or made you feel bad for wanting their attention. I hurt for you because of what you might have gone through to feel that way, I hurt for me because I cared. 
I think I will leave you alone until you are less “bitey” I hope you know that you deserve to be loved, but I cannot lose any more faith in humanity right now,  maybe you’ll check in when it hurts you less to be cared for. Sorry you felt like I was crossing boundaries, I was only trying to relate to you. I didn’t mean to press. 

9. Lastly, we check in fewer. These days, but I still love your smile. Can’t wait to have coffee with you on Saturday. You said you got me a gift, funny, I got one for you too, lol but I’m waiting to surprise you when I see you. I love your smile. I also can’t wait to see what you’ve been painting.

This news immediately skyrockets to the top of the trending charts across the virtual realm. Su Wei nonchalantly adjusts her black-framed glasses and observes the photos in the article with a stoic expression.

The images, though slightly blurred, still reveal a man and a woman sharing an affectionate kiss by a window. The male protagonist, in particular, draws attention—it’s her husband, Fu Yan’an, the heir to one of Rivertown’s most influential families. A man who wields immense power over the city’s economic affairs.

It’s almost comical. They’ve been married for two years, and Fu Yan’an has never set foot in Rivertown. Even during their marriage registration, he remained absent, sending his lawyer to complete the formalities with Su Wei, exchanging their documents. She is aware that Fu Yan’an has always been reluctant about this union. He only agreed to marry her due to a favor her grandfather once did for Fu Yan’an’s wife, who then insisted he marry Su Wei to provide her with a carefree life.

Initially, she held some hopes for their marriage. However, over the past two years, Fu Yan’an has been entangled in numerous scandals with various minor celebrities…

Su Wei’s lips curl as she takes out her phone, finding Fu Yan’an’s number. This marks the first time in two years that she has dialed his number.

The call is answered promptly.

“Hello, it’s Su Wei.”

“Su Wei? Which Su Wei?”

The male voice on the other end is deep and resonant, its icy tone strangely alluring. Su Wei can’t help but chuckle, clutching her phone tightly.

It appears he doesn’t even remember his wife’s name.

“I’m the other half of your marriage certificate.”

“Is that so? What do you want?”

The man’s voice turns even colder.

Su Wei adjusts her glasses and calmly states, “Let’s get a divorce.”

A moment of silence follows on the call, and then Fu Yan’an questions, “Have you thought it through?”

“Absolutely.”

“Any conditions you want to set?”

“No need! Mr. Fu, I’m not interested in your wealth. Moreover, I have no desire to share a single carrot with anyone. I’ve already prepared the divorce agreement. I’ll leave without a claim.”

Su Wei delivers her message in one breath and promptly hangs up. To them, it’s as if they are complete strangers. From this day forward, they’ll go their separate ways, leaving behind all connections!

Su Wei ascends to her apartment, taking off her black-framed glasses, revealing a strikingly beautiful face. She places the divorce agreement she prepared earlier on the coffee table and swiftly collects her meticulously packed luggage.

1mw2lp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mw2lp9/nf_how_to_light_an_eyeball/,[NF] How to Light an Eyeball,"At work they asked me to light a closeup photo of a person’s eyeball. They weren’t getting enough detail or color out of it. I told them I knew what to do.  


I got a lot of kind feedback when I posted that photo to my Instagram page. Someone reached out  and asked how I knew how to do that — if I had done a lot of macro work. 
It’s been three times now, and I can describe each time. The first time, you sat across from me on a patio after work and we ate sandwiches and drank wine. I wrote a poem and it wasn’t about you, but a few lines were. You had asked me a question and I didn’t hear it because it broke me out of a trance. There was an umbrella above us. The sun was to my left. You leaned back from the umbrella  and the warm sunset hit you hard across the right side of your face. It hit the white part of your eye at a ninety degree angle and your dark eye lit up like an abstract water color painting. I never knew they were such a vivid brown with gradations of darker and lighter brown throughout. I could almost see it swirling like a cup of black coffee that had milk splashed into it.  


The second time you were laying on my chest on my couch. The sun was beaming in through the window at sunset. The light comes in really nicely to my house and I admired it from time to time, but it was never as beautiful as when you pushed yourself up from my chest and looked down at  me. You perfectly rose into the sunset and it hit the left side of your face, scooping into the white behind your pupil and burning me with the galaxy of pine bark you kept hidden in the dark. I did not hear what you asked me, and I never had the words for a poem.  


The third time we were drinking wine on a patio again. You had said you didn’t like the way I was looking at you — and I apologized. I looked away, and to my left a man was closing an umbrella. When he closed it I was hit in the face with the sun, so I looked back at you. You were still looking  at me. You looked angry. You may have been angry. Things like that were hidden in the same  darkness you kept the color of your eyes in. The sun made the right side of your face this deep burnt sienna. The shadow made the left side a cold blue. It hit perfectly that your right eye came alive again, as if it were glowing from within. As if laser beams were going to shoot forth and vaporize me right there at the table. I would’ve welcomed it, because if you had asked me to stop looking at you again, I would have not been able to.  


When I was a kid I would stare at the sun in car rides. The sun would burn itself into my vision and I  would see this color-changing circle for twenty minutes after. If when I turned my head from you there was a color-changing image of you in my vision for me to continue to look upon for twenty minutes I might’ve been able to bring myself to do it. But it doesn’t happen like that. So I wrote this poem.  


I was in my Instagram messages watching a vertical line blink at me. I knew I couldn’t write all of that because it was a secret I hadn’t even told you about.  


Blink. Blink. Blink.  


“Just experience.”

For a long time, I felt like meditation wasn’t for me. I couldn’t sit still for even 5 minutes without getting restless or reaching for my phone. Every “30-minute guided meditation” just made me feel like I was failing.

But in the last few weeks, I started really small and noticed huge changes. Here’s what worked for me (with a low attention span):

* **Started with 2–3 minutes max** (literally set a timer). I’d just focus on my breath or the sounds in the room. Once I stopped trying to “empty my mind,” it felt easier.
* **Habit stacking**: I tied it to things I was already doing. Example: before my morning coffee, I sit down and take 3–4 slow breaths. Before sleep, I do a quick body scan lying in bed.
* **Micro-mindfulness in daily life**: Instead of sitting cross-legged in silence, I practiced while walking, showering, or drinking tea. Just focusing fully on the moment.
* **Guided audios on YouTube/Headspace:** My brain likes structure. A voice telling me what to do kept me from wandering off.
* **Increased slowly**: In every few weeks/days of 2–3 minutes, I naturally stretched it to 5–10 without forcing myself. Some days it’s longer, some days it’s shorter, but consistency is what matters.

👉 **The result**: I don’t feel like I’ve “mastered” meditation, but I’m noticeably less reactive in stressful situations. I catch myself pausing instead of spiraling. And my focus during work has improved; I can actually stick with tasks longer before reaching for distractions.

Just wanted to share because I know a lot of people think meditation is only for the super-disciplined. Curious to know if anyone else here started mindfulness with micro-sessions instead of the traditional “sit for 20–30 minutes”?",2,1755755073.0,Ayurveda,0,1.0,False

You met me with a hug and a smile. Thank you for the dumb dad joke. 

2. I held the door because I saw that your hand were full and your small son was tired and cranky. 
You seemed so relieved to not have to fight him  or shift the weight of the baby in your arms. You have a beautiful smile. I see you, I know it’s thankless, but you’re doing it. 

3. I stopped traffic to let you cross the street. 
You smiled on the sidewalk and said thank you. I really appreciated that. You looked surprised when I told you to have a nice day. 

4. I left a plate of food next to you on the bench. 
Youre drunk and passed out. You didn’t say anything, you should take a shower when you can, maybe next time I’ll leave quarters for the harbor showers. I think I have a pair of hiking boots that will fit you. I’ll leave them here with your name on them. 

5. We sent pictures back and forth today and discussed deep feelings. You told me how much you missed your twin flame. 
I admire your love and admiration for them. It was nice to relate to someone who understands what it’s like to feel lost without the person they love. I see you. Thank you for seeing me and sharing. You have beautiful eyes and a creative soul. 

6. I shared pictures with you and you with me, we laughed , made dinner plans and then you stood me up to spend time with your boyfriend, I get it. I don’t blame you. 

7. We shared pictures and memes, I offered you dinner, and you declined respectfully, thank you for being there for me today. I was having a rough evening and you lightened it up a lot. 

8. I sent pictures and poked a couple jokes at ya, offered to bring you dinner and told I might be asleep but that my door was open if you needed anything. 
You scolded me about me needing validation from you and said you understood why my ex treated me the way he did. 
I was hurt. I didn’t like being misunderstood. I wondered if people have treated you that way or made you feel bad for wanting their attention. I hurt for you because of what you might have gone through to feel that way, I hurt for me because I cared. 
I think I will leave you alone until you are less “bitey” I hope you know that you deserve to be loved, but I cannot lose any more faith in humanity right now,  maybe you’ll check in when it hurts you less to be cared for. Sorry you felt like I was crossing boundaries, I was only trying to relate to you. I didn’t mean to press. 

9. Lastly, we check in fewer. These days, but I still love your smile. Can’t wait to have coffee with you on Saturday. You said you got me a gift, funny, I got one for you too, lol but I’m waiting to surprise you when I see you. I love your smile. I also can’t wait to see what you’ve been painting. 

Each of you shared something with me today. Thank you. I am still learning. I’m still healing. Slowly, you’ve all helped me get closer to remembering who I am. I love you all ",2,1755754908.0,UnsentTexts,2,1.0,False

1mw2iwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreakFreakersonwrites/comments/1mw2iwd/wanderlust_part_5/,Wanderlust part 5,"Monday morning came just as Elias had said it would. The Wyoming sun beat down on the *Wanderlust*, but inside, in the belly of the ship, it was cool and dim. Elias was a silhouette against a flickering work light, his hands deep inside a control panel, covered in grease. The familiar smell of ozone and burnt wiring was a comfort. The ship needed a lot of work, but he was home. He was a simple man, and this was his simple life. His crew was on leave, enjoying their break, leaving him to the quiet solitude of his work.

A small tremor ran through the deck plates, and a moment later, a figure appeared at the bottom of the landing ramp. It was a young woman, her face a striking blend of exhaustion and fierce determination. Her clothes were clean, professional, and completely out of place against the ship's grimy hull. She had a microphone in one hand, her eyes fixed on Elias.

""Captain Vance?"" she called out, her voice clear and carrying. ""I'm with the World News Collective. My name is Maya. I was told you were taking questions.""

Elias pulled his hands out of the panel, leaving a pair of oily handprints on his jumpsuit. He looked at her, his expression unreadable. He had no interest in being a celebrity. He just wanted to fix his ship and go fishing.

""Yeah,"" he grunted. ""I'm taking questions. But my rules."" He gestured around the ship, at the exposed wiring and the tools scattered everywhere. ""The ship's got to get fixed. This is my 'office hours.'""

Maya, the fire in her eyes unwavering, stood her ground. ""I understand, sir. We've read the transcripts. The world is waiting for your next words.""

Elias just looked at her, then down at his hands, then at the wrench next to his foot. He had a job to do, and he was tired of all the talk. His offer from the meeting, made as a test of integrity, now presented itself again.

He sighed, picking up the wrench. ""Well, you wanna talk?"" he said. ""Get over here.""

He held out the wrench to her, the metal a dull gray against his greasy palm. He was offering her a choice: an interview or a lesson. A story or the truth.

""You said you'd answer my questions,"" she said, her grip on the microphone tightening.

""I will,"" he said. ""We'll talk. But you gotta help. I'm busy.""

  
""You pick, little lady,"" he said, his voice a low rumble. ""You want a story? Get your hands dirty."" He gestured to the humming camera drone she had sent into the ship's cramped space. ""Oh, your camera drone? It's okay to be out, unless you just want audio.""

Maya stood still for a long moment, the hum of the ship's damaged systems a constant, grinding rhythm. This was not the interview she had prepared for. It was not the story she was trained to get. Her job was to observe, to report, to stand apart. But the man in front of her, the reluctant hero of humanity, was not playing by her rules. He was offering her a choice between a hollow spectacle and an honest, messy truth.

The ""fire in her eyes"" that had been a reporter's drive suddenly became the simple fire of curiosity. She made her decision. She lowered the microphone, placing it carefully on a crate. Then, with a firm resolve, she reached for the wrench.

Elias watched her, a ghost of a smile touching his lips. He said nothing, but a look of approval passed through his tired eyes. He turned back to the control panel, motioning for her to hand him a screwdriver from the floor.

""First rule of working with old ships,"" he said, his voice now taking on the patient tone of a teacher. ""You don't force it. You listen to it. She'll tell ya what she needs.""

Maya handed him the screwdriver. She had no questions yet. She just watched and listened. The microphone was gone. The camera drone still hummed, capturing the simple, unscripted moment. A woman and an old man, side by side, working on a battered ship. The greatest story in the universe was finally being told, not in a press conference or a treaty, but in the quiet, honest labor of a Tuesday morning.

""You pick, little lady,"" he said, his voice a low rumble. ""You want a story? Get your hands dirty."" He gestured to the humming camera drone she had sent into the ship's cramped space. ""Oh, your camera drone? It's okay to be out, unless you just want audio.""

A woman and an old man, side by side, working on a battered ship. The greatest story in the universe was finally being told, not in a press conference or a treaty, but in the quiet, honest labor of a Tuesday morning.

Elias ran a hand along a battered bulkhead, the metal warm beneath his greasy palm. He wasn't talking to Maya as a reporter; he was talking to her as a fellow crewmate, now that she had a wrench in her hand.

""She's seen us through a lot,"" he said, his voice a low, fond murmur. ""She's hauled so much."" He paused, looking down at his worn boots. ""Best thing... those kids. The second best... the look on the faces of everyone when we dropped 'em off and left."" He chuckled, a deep, rattling sound that shook with humor.

Maya's hands, still clean from her previous life, stilled on the wrench. She had been sent to get a story, a quote, a headline. But she was getting something else entirely. She was getting the unvarnished truth of a man who found pride not in fame, but in a simple, good deed. She watched him chuckle, a man who had changed the course of galactic history, and realized his greatest satisfaction came from leaving others dumbfounded by a simple act of decency.

She put the wrench down and picked up the microphone, but she didn't turn it on. She was just holding it, looking at Elias, a new kind of fire in her eyes. It was no longer the ambition of a reporter. It was the awe of a student. The story wasn't just about a man's actions; it was about the quiet dignity of a good person. She had her story, and it was a thousand times more profound than anything she could have imagined.

""Ask away,"" he repeated, not looking up from his work.

Maya put the wrench down and picked up the microphone again, but this time she held it differently. It wasn't a tool for a broadcast; it was a tool for listening. The fire in her eyes was no longer that of a reporter chasing a story, but of a student seeking a truth.

""The world sees you as a hero,"" she said, her voice now softer, more direct. ""They're calling you a philosopher and a diplomat. Do you... do you ever feel the weight of what you did?""

  
""Soldiers, police, firefighters, first responders, those are heroes,"" he said plainly, his voice resonating with a deep, personal respect. ""A diplomat? Nah, I can still throw hands if needed, and a philosopher? Nah, I'm none of that.""

He looked at Maya, his smile warm and genuine, a stark contrast to the grease and grime on his face. ""I was a farmer, lucked up into this ship, decided to make my fortune. I go to our colonies, make my rounds, make some credits, have a good cold beer and a cigar, come home, rinse and repeat.""

He took a moment to look around at his ship, his home, a look of profound contentment on his face. ""Nah, I'm nothin' more than... well, just me.""

Maya stood in the oil-scented air of the engine room, her professional detachment shattered. The world had built him up as a towering figure of galactic importance, a symbol of humanity's better nature. But he had just boiled it all down to the simple, humble truth of a man's life. He wasn't a symbol. He was just a guy. His actions, the very things that had captivated the galaxy, were to him no more than a simple, honest part of his life's routine. He had just given her the final piece of the puzzle, the most important piece of all: he was nothing special, and in that, he was everything.

""Have you seen the videos?"" he asked, his voice softening. ""Of the kids gettin' to meet alien kids?""

He chuckled, a warm, genuine sound that echoed in the quiet space of the *Wanderlust*.

""Star Trek.""

Maya looked at him, and for the first time since she had walked onto the ship, she was speechless. She had spent weeks trying to understand the galactic politics, the philosophical implications, the military strategies. She had been searching for the grand narrative, the reason for it all.

And here it was, in the words of a simple man: the ultimate reason was the children. Not the survival of humanity, not the acquisition of knowledge or power, but the simple, joyous connection of two different species meeting for the first time as friends. The grand, galactic adventure was just a means to a beautiful, human end. The universe wasn't something to conquer or dominate, but something to explore, hand in hand, with the next generation. The cameras hummed, and the story was finally complete.

  
""So, Maya, right?"" he said, his voice a low rumble.

Maya's gaze, which had been fixed on the profound truth of his last words, shifted to him. The fire in her eyes, once a symbol of her ambition, was now a symbol of her understanding. She had come to him with questions about a galactic hero, a philosopher-king who had single-handedly changed the course of interstellar relations. She had come prepared to ask about treaties, politics, and the future of humanity.

But he was none of those things. He was just a man. He had just answered the most complex question in the universe with a simple answer: it's not about being a hero; it's about being ""just me.""

""Yeah,"" she said, her voice barely a whisper. ""Maya.""

""You have anything else you wanna ask? You have your story, gonna love to see the edit, but total access. Ask me what's really on your mind.""

He took a slow drink of water, watching her. The silence in the engine room was a heavy, expectant thing. The grease on her hands felt like a badge of honor. She had listened to his stories, watched him work, and had gotten a simple, honest truth. Now, he was giving her the chance to go deeper. To ask the questions no one else had the courage to.

Maya looked down at the hand-held recorder, then at the camera drone hovering silently in the corner. Her mind raced not with headlines, but with the quiet, profound moments he had shared. She put the recorder on a metal crate. She had her story. Now she was here for something else.

""Captain,"" she began, her voice a little shaky, but full of the fire that had brought her here. ""You've talked about a lot of things. But you never mentioned your family. Your wife, your kids... why not?""

  
""Lost 'em,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, painful rasp that was barely a whisper. ""Wife to cancer. My son, lost him to a wreck. Wasn't his. He ran in... ship collapsed on him. But he saved three people.""

Elias looked at Maya, his eyes holding a depth of sorrow that no galactic-wide broadcast could ever capture. A single, profound truth filled the greasy air of the engine room.

""That boy, David, my son... he's my hero.""

Maya's hand, still covered in grease, dropped from the recorder. The fire in her eyes, once a symbol of her ambition, was replaced by a quiet, profound empathy. She had come to find a story about a hero who saved the galaxy, but she had found a father who had been given a reason to believe in heroism in the first place. The grand, galactic tale of first contact, the reason for the aliens' arrival, the philosophy of ""pack bonds,"" all of it had just been explained in a single, heartbreaking truth. It wasn't just about saving the kids. It was about a man, a farmer, doing what he believed his son would have done.

She had her story. And it was the best one she would ever tell.

  
""Now, go. Future's out there, girl. Go grab it and make it a good one."" He smiled, a genuine, warm smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes, and gave a simple wave.

Maya stood there for a long moment, the hand with the recorder now holding a piece of a story that would change the world. He had given her not just a scoop, but a purpose. A mission to tell a story that wasn't about power or politics, but about love and loss, and the quiet, unwavering decency of a single human being. She had come to report on a man who had changed the world, and she was leaving with the knowledge that she, too, was now a part of his story. She waved back, her own smile a mix of tears and profound gratitude.

And with that, the freighter captain turned back to his ship, the hero of humanity getting back to work on the quiet task of getting his ship fixed.

# World News Collective Special Broadcast: The Heart of Humanity



**ANCHOR (V.O., somber and thoughtful):** Tonight, we bring you a story that has reshaped our understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe. It began with a battered freighter, a daring rescue, and a simple question posed to the vastness of the cosmos. It continued with an unprecedented act of trust and an alien fleet appearing in our skies. And it culminates now, in the quiet words of a man who never asked to be a hero.

*(The broadcast cuts to sweeping visuals of the Wanderlust in space, then transitions to the chaotic scenes of the Council fleet's arrival over Earth. News snippets and expert commentary from the past few weeks flash across the screen, recapping the initial shock and the unfolding revelations.)*

**ANCHOR (V.O.):** For weeks, the world has debated the meaning of first contact, the significance of the human archives, and the enigmatic figure at the center of it all: Captain Elias Vance. Today, one of our own had the opportunity to meet this extraordinary man, not in a sterile conference room, but in the heart of his ship, amidst the grease and the quiet hum of honest labor.

*(The screen transitions to raw, slightly shaky footage from Maya's camera drone. It shows the interior of the Wanderlust's engine room, dimly lit and cluttered. Elias, his back to the camera, is working on a panel. Maya enters the frame, holding a microphone, her initial nervousness palpable.)*

**MAYA (on-screen, her voice a little hesitant at first):** Captain Vance? I'm Maya, with the World News Collective. I was told you were taking questions.

*(The footage shows Elias turning, his weathered face etched with weariness but his eyes holding a steady gaze. The exchange about the wrench and getting her hands dirty is shown, the raw audio clear and unfiltered.)*

**ANCHOR (V.O.):** What followed was not a formal interview, but a series of quiet conversations, punctuated by the clang of tools and the scent of engine oil. Captain Vance spoke not of galactic politics or diplomatic strategy, but of simple truths, of a ""pack bond"" that extends beyond our species, and of a fundamental human desire to ""do what's right.""

*(Snippets of their conversation are played over more drone footage: Elias talking about the kids, his chuckle at their bewildered saviors, his explanation of the human archives, and his casual dismissal of his heroic status.)*

**MAYA (on-screen, her voice softening):** The world sees you as a hero. They're calling you a philosopher and a diplomat. Do you... do you ever feel the weight of what you did?

**ELIAS (on-screen, his voice plain and honest):** Soldiers, police, firefighters, first responders, those are heroes... Nah, I'm nothin' more than... well, just me.

*(The broadcast cuts back to Maya, now in a studio setting, her expression deeply moved.)*

**MAYA (live):** He is ""just him."" A farmer who found his way to the stars, a man who acted on instinct and compassion, a captain who cares more about a cold beer and a working ship than galactic accolades. We asked him about the weight of his actions, and he simply shrugged it off. He sees himself not as a hero, but as a man who did what felt right.

*(A brief pause, Maya's voice catching slightly.)*

**MAYA (live):** But then... then I asked him about his family.

*(The broadcast cuts back to the raw footage, the atmosphere in the engine room suddenly heavy and still. Elias's voice is a bare whisper as he speaks of his wife and his son, David.)*

**ELIAS (on-screen, his voice filled with grief and pride):** Lost 'em... That boy, David, my son... he's my hero.

*(The broadcast returns to Maya in the studio, tears welling in her eyes.)*

**MAYA (live, her voice trembling):** In that moment, surrounded by the grease and the tools of his ordinary life, Captain Elias Vance revealed the true heart of humanity. It is not in grand speeches or political maneuvering, but in the quiet love for our families, in the simple desire to help those in need, and in the enduring strength we find in loss.

*(The final moments of the drone footage are shown: Elias smiling gently, waving, and turning back to his work.)*

**MAYA (live):** He told me to go. To take the future and make it a good one. And that is what we must do. We must honor the accidental diplomat, the unassuming philosopher, the grieving father who showed the galaxy what it means to be human.

*(The broadcast concludes with a lingering shot of the Wanderlust bathed in the glow of Earth's dawn.)*

**INT.** ***WANDERLUST*** **- DAY**

Elias sits in his worn command chair, a fresh mug of coffee in his hand, watching the flickering image on the main screen. He sees Maya's face, her earnest delivery, the raw footage from his ship. He sees the images of the alien fleets, the news reports, the experts pontificating.

He takes a slow sip of his coffee, a faint smile playing on his lips. He hadn't asked for any of this. He was just a man, missing his family, fixing his ship, and trying to do right by the galaxy that had suddenly become his neighbor.

He watches Maya's tearful conclusion, her heartfelt plea for humanity to live up to the image he had inadvertently presented. He snorts softly. Teenagers. Wild and unpredictable, but with a good heart underneath it all. Just like humanity.

He sets down his mug, the clink echoing in the quiet bridge. He looks out at the familiar blue marble of Earth hanging in the void. The future was out there, alright. And it looked like it was going to be one hell of a ride. He just hoped he had enough beer and cigars for it.",1,1755754814.0,FreakFreakersonwrites,0,1.0,False

I tried Flonase on a qtip for the itchy ears and it’s instant relief. I was scratching my inner ears so much I was getting small abscesses and bleeding from doing it in my sleep. It’s a game changer.
For the migraines I do a combo of hot coffee, Benadryl, advil and magnesium and my headaches are less intense and something I can sleep off.
For the hot flashes I started walking at intervals during the day. 3-4 15 min walks as I am disabled and have mobility issues. The exercise has oddly enough helped regulate the hot flashes and make them less. I still take 2 showers a day to be safe but another game changer.
Lastly the mood changes. I had taken trileptal in my 20s for seizures and when they came back I was put back on it. I have had the most stable moods I’ve ever had in my life.

I’m about to be 31, Jordanian, living just outside Amman on a farm with a gorgeous, spacious house. (Yes, plenty of space for family BBQs, kids running around, and morning coffee with a view 🌳☕).

About me:
	•	A realist but optimistic — I see life as it is, but I always believe in better days ahead.
	•	Sarcasm is my second language, so expect laughter and playful comebacks.
	•	Family is everything. Whoever doesn’t respect their parents won’t have خير for others (الي ما اله خير لا أهله ما الهم خير لغيرهم).
	•	I’m an incredible cook (not just eggs 🍳).
	•	A traveler, curious soul, and coffee lover.
	•	A cigar aficionado (no worries, not daily). I don’t mind if you enjoy shisha sometimes, but definitely not vape, iQOS, or cigarettes.
	•	I’m a well-dressed man and I value elegance — I’d love my wife to also be tasteful, elegant, and well-dressed.
	•	Kind, caring, and a bit old-school when it comes to values.

What I’m looking for:
	•	A woman who’s serious about marriage and family.
	•	Strong yet feminine, respectful, and full of love.
	•	Someone who accepts my daughter (she doesn’t live with me, but she’s part of my life — and must always be respected if she did).
	•	A partner who lives by قناعة — contentment. Whether we’re rich or poor, الحمدلله always.
	•	I value traditional family roles — I’ll be the man who provides, protects, and takes care of you and the home. In return, what I need is simple: a loving wife who supports me, respects me, and builds her own family with me.

I’ve built my life — home, work, vision. What I’m missing is the right woman to share it all with: a partner to build a marriage filled with love, respect, and laughter.

If this speaks to you, I’d love to hear from you 🌹",3,1755754589.0,marriajo,0,1.0,False

I’d like to meet some friendly people while I’m there – just conversations, maybe sharing a coffee or a meal. I’m into cars, travel, and photography, and I work in IT.

1mw2f66,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreakFreakersonwrites/comments/1mw2f66/wanderlust_part_4/,Wanderlust part 4,"""Okay, that oughta do it,"" the comms officer grunted, wiping a smear of grease from his brow. The jury-rigged comms array, held together with more prayer than technology, finally sputtered to life with a weak but steady signal. The *Wanderlust* was a mess, its hull pockmarked from the run, the engines rattling like a loose bucket of bolts. Captain Elias Vance just grinned, leaning back in his chair. ""Bout time. I'm ready to see some green grass and a cold one.""

""Five seconds to jump,"" the nav officer called out. The crew braced themselves, and with a familiar, gut-lurching groan, the *Wanderlust* warped back into the Sol system.

But something was wrong.

The viewscreen, usually filled with the slow, predictable ballet of cargo ships and terrestrial satellites, was a spectacle of impossible grace. Sleek, crystalline vessels, far more elegant than anything humanity had ever built, floated in silent formation near the moon. They were joined by human ships that were clearly new—their designs were a strange, geometric fusion of human engineering and alien aesthetics. A vast, glowing orbital platform hung in place where a simple space station used to be. The sky was filled with a constant, silent, purposeful traffic.

The crew stared in stunned, disbelieving silence. ""What... what in the hell is that?"" a mechanic stammered.

The newly repaired comms array, now functioning at full capacity, was flooded with a cacophony of chatter. It wasn't the usual private chatter between freighters and ports. It was an endless loop of news reports and official diplomatic channels, each one more baffling than the last.

""...unprecedented partnership between the Galactic Council and Humanity...""

""...the full release of the human archives, a gift from Captain Elias Vance...""

""...a testament to the courage of a freighter crew who acted with no thought of reward...""

The crew looked at Elias, then at the viewscreen, then back at Elias. His name. The *Wanderlust*. Their ship. Everything the aliens were saying pointed back to them.

""Boss,"" the nav officer whispered, his voice trembling. ""Did... did we miss something?""

Elias took the synth-cigar out of his mouth, his jaw slack. He looked around the bridge at his crew, all of them staring at him with a mixture of confusion and profound shock. They had left Earth a few weeks ago as a simple freighter crew. They had returned as accidental galactic heroes.

Elias took the synth-cigar out of his mouth, his jaw slack. He looked around the bridge at his crew, all of them staring at him with a mixture of confusion and profound shock. They had left Earth a few weeks ago as a simple freighter crew. They had returned as accidental galactic heroes.

  
The *Wanderlust*, a vessel of patched-up metal and scuff marks, descended from the heavens with a groan that rattled its every bolt. It didn't land on a sterile, polished tarmac. It landed with a thud in a wide-open field on the outskirts of Harmony, Wyoming, not far from Elias Vance's small homestead. A cloud of dust billowed up, momentarily obscuring the sight of the most famous ship in the galaxy touching down in a quiet, rural town.

But the field wasn't quiet. It was a cacophony of organized chaos. World governments had a few weeks to prepare for this exact scenario, and they had. The field was lined with official vehicles and armored transports. Cameras from every major news network were trained on the ship. Standing in a designated zone, a crowd of figures waited with a mix of impatience and awe.

As the landing ramp of the *Wanderlust* hissed open, a few of the townsfolk, who had gathered at the edge of the field, broke through the perimeter, their faces a mixture of local curiosity and profound relief. ""Elias!"" a woman yelled. ""You're back!""

Elias and his crew, still in their grease-stained uniforms, stumbled down the ramp, squinting in the afternoon sun. They looked exactly as they had left: tired, disheveled, and completely unprepared for what awaited them.

A human diplomat, a stern-faced man in a perfectly tailored suit, marched forward, his face a storm of conflicting emotions. ""Captain Vance,"" he said, his voice barely controlled, ""Do you have any idea what you've done? We have been operating on a razor's edge for weeks! What in the hell were you thinking?""

At the same moment, the Kryll and Sylvan diplomats, who had been waiting patiently in the distance, moved forward, a look of serene reverence on their faces. The Kryll's translator hummed. ""Captain Vance. We offer you the immense gratitude of the Galactic Council. Your actions have changed the course of inter-species relations.""

Elias looked at the angry human, then at the grateful aliens, then back at his ship. He was a simple freighter captain, and in a single moment, his two worlds had collided with the force of a supernova.

Without a moment to rest or even to change his clothes, Elias Vance was escorted, along with his baffled crew, to a hastily constructed mobile command unit. He was being pulled from the grime of his work and into a meeting that would decide the fate of his species.

  
The mobile command unit was a sterile, high-tech box, its white walls and polished floors a stark contrast to the grime of the *Wanderlust*'s bridge. Seated around a gleaming conference table were the most powerful people on the planet: grim-faced generals, smooth-talking politicians, and high-strung diplomats. In the center, alone, sat Captain Elias Vance, his weathered face and work-stained uniform making him look like a visitor from a different era. The alien diplomats, the Kryll and the Sylvan, observed silently from a far corner, their presence a constant, alien reminder of the stakes.

The human diplomat who had greeted him in the field leaned forward. ""Captain Vance, we need to understand your actions. This is a matter of global security.""

Elias just folded his hands on the table, a glint of defiance in his eyes. ""What was I thinking?"" he said, his voice a low rumble. He waited until the entire room was seated, all eyes fixed on him. ""Well, I thought a few things, and I'll tell y'all once this is being broadcast to everyone, or I'll shut the hell up for the next 50 years and go fishin'.""

A furious murmur swept through the room. ""That is out of the question!"" a general snapped. ""This is classified information!""

""Then I ain't sayin' a word,"" Elias said, leaning back in his chair. He was a rock, an immovable force of pure, unyielding integrity. He simply sat there and waited.

The human diplomats looked at each other in a panicked, silent debate. They were trapped. They could not risk alienating the man who, by a single, personal act, had become the linchpin of their relationship with the galaxy. The Kryll and the Sylvan watched with a look of dawning comprehension. This was it. This was the ""no-lie"" rule in action, the ""pack bond"" in a new, political form. The simple, raw honesty that had so baffled them now held the entire room hostage.

After a long, tense moment, the lead diplomat sighed, a look of profound defeat on his face. He gestured to a tech. ""Broadcast it. Everything. Now.""

Across the world, televisions and personal devices flickered to life. The face of an old, exhausted freighter captain filled every screen. The first man to officially address the entire planet, and the galaxy, was about to explain exactly what he was thinking.

The world was silent. Billions of people, from bustling city centers to remote villages, were glued to screens, watching as a simple freighter captain, in a stained uniform, began to speak to the galaxy.

""Y'all, I was asked by a very angry man what was I thinking?"" Elias said, his voice a gravelly rumble that was now heard across a thousand languages. ""Well... *Star Trek*,"" and he grinned. The reference landed with an audible intake of breath from every human watching. ""Wasn't perfect, there were wars, issues, but all those races we imagined? Look around. They're here now.""

He leaned forward, his grin fading into a look of solemn truth. ""Did I think when we saved those kids? Yep. I thought about how my own kin, humanity, would react if we just let it happen. And why not? We don't know 'em, right? If that's what you feel, screw you. Grow up. We ain't alone. And if we got to make a first impression, I tried to make it the one we wanna make.""

His gaze seemed to look through the cameras, into the eyes of every person watching. ""Now the archives? And why? Why not? Everything's there. Good, bad, ugly, beautiful. And by doing this, they know what we are, and those more greasy leaders can't try and sugarcoat us. Nope. Honestly and a handshake have worked for eons. It took lawyers and politicians to screw it up."" He smiled. ""Humans, aliens, look around. A simple act, and now look around. Was this worth it?""

He stood, his voice gaining a new, thunderous weight. ""Damn right it was. And if the *Wanderlust* had been blown outta the sky after we unloaded those kids?"" His voice dropped, becoming a low, powerful hammer of a whisper. ""**Well that wouldn't have mattered either. Kids were safe.**""

He looked to everyone in the room and across the world. The silence was absolute. ""Now, any questions? I'll answer 'em one at a time, though. And only with a cold beer and a good cigar.""

  
The air in the mobile command unit was so thick with silence it felt like a physical weight. On every screen across the world, billions of people sat in stunned silence. Elias Vance, the freighter captain, had just given the greatest speech in human history, one that perfectly encapsulated the chaotic, contradictory, and deeply emotional nature of his species. The governments, the military, the diplomats—they were all rendered speechless.

A young aide, looking terrified, scurried from the side of the room. He placed a cold bottle of beer and a lit cigar on the table in front of Elias. The glass was beaded with condensation. The cigar gave off a simple, earthy aroma. The room's high-tech polish was now completely secondary to these two simple, ancient human items.

Elias took a long, slow sip of the beer, a look of profound satisfaction on his face. He then picked up the cigar and took a puff, the smoke curling around his head like a halo. He looked at the assembled representatives, his gaze steady and patient.

The first to speak was not a human, but the Kryll diplomat. It leaned forward, its crystalline form shifting to a new, respectful posture.

""Captain Vance,"" the Kryll's voice hummed, its tone now filled with a genuine, unquantifiable curiosity. ""You spoke of a 'handshake' and of a philosophy that has worked for 'eons.' You also mentioned that lawyers and politicians have 'screwed it up.' Is honesty and a handshake truly more binding to a human than a formal treaty?""

  
""Between people,"" he said, taking a sip of his beer. ""Handshakes work. Now when we're talking... billions... trillions? That's when we have to have folks we choose to make the right choices, make the right treaties."" He chuckled, a dry, rattling sound. ""On the *Wanderlust*, we have one rule: don't be a dick. Those raiders were being dicks. I just did what I thought was right.""

He took a puff of his cigar, the smoke a thin gray ribbon in the air. ""And when y'all found us and asked 'why?'... that's a very... human question. So I figured, show y'all everything. But I'm sidetracking. This is gonna take time, but look—we're here together. No treaty, no paperwork signed, and we're already better for it.""

The human leaders in the room shifted uncomfortably. Their entire professional lives were dedicated to the very paperwork Elias had dismissed so casually. They looked at the aliens, who were observing with a look that was now a mixture of professional interest and personal fascination. The Kryll's crystalline form shifted slightly, its internal lights dimming as it processed this new, elegant data. The Sylvan's form seemed to hum, absorbing the emotional honesty of his words.

The Kryll delegate then spoke, its voice a soft hum. ""Captain Vance, we understand your point. You operate on a simple, consistent moral code. This is what you call... the 'don't be a dick' rule?""

Elias took a long drag from his cigar. ""Yeah. It's an unwritten rule, but it works for us."" He grinned. ""What's the next question?""

The Sylvan, whose form seemed to radiate a new warmth, now addressed him. ""We have seen your history. We have seen your wars. We have seen your suffering. But you have told us you have gotten your heads 'out of your asses.' What do you mean by this? What has changed?""

  
""We've grown up a bit. We aren't kids running blind anymore. We're more like a bunch of teenagers now, wanting to experience everything we can. Are we a little wild? Yeah. Are we gonna make mistakes? Oh, Lords, yes. But 300 years ago, your fleet showing up, it wouldn't have been good. We have our past, but we look at it. We teach all of it now, so we can learn to be better.""

The Sylvan diplomat’s leafy form seemed to unfurl, a gesture of profound understanding. The metaphor resonated deeply. They were seeing a species in a state of adolescence—a difficult, chaotic, and beautiful period of growth. They were not a completed project, but a work in progress, and their open acknowledgment of that fact was a greater sign of maturity than any treaty could have been.

The Kryll diplomat’s internal light pulsed rapidly. It had a new data point. The **rate of moral evolution**. A species capable of such rapid, intentional change was unlike anything in the galactic records. The humans' willingness to expose their painful history to their young, and to an entire galaxy, was the key to this unprecedented growth.

The human government officials in the room exchanged bewildered glances. Elias had just given them a universal identity—a rebellious, well-meaning teenager on the cusp of adulthood. It was simple, honest, and completely disarming. He had, once again, outmaneuvered them by simply telling the truth.

An older human diplomat, a woman who had spent decades in fragile negotiations, finally broke the silence. She looked at Elias with a mixture of respect and professional frustration.

""Captain Vance,"" she began, her voice steady. ""We understand your perspective. But a teenager is still volatile. How can we, and the rest of the galaxy, be sure that the mistakes you will inevitably make won't result in a catastrophic loss of life?""

  
""Because we're better than that,"" Elias said, taking a sip of his beer and looking at the older diplomat. ""We haven't fought each other in 500 years, and we still have college football, and you know that's almost a religion in some places, and we haven't popped off.""

A few of the human officials looked at each other, trying to stifle a smile. The Sylvan and Kryll envoys, however, were analyzing his statement with a new kind of interest. They'd read about the ancient rituals of football in the archives—the tribal loyalties, the fierce competition, the passionate displays of emotion. That a species could channel such powerful, primal urges into a non-lethal contest and maintain a lasting peace was a powerful data point.

Elias laughed, a sound of genuine, weary amusement. ""Look, how do we all not act up, humans and aliens? Our better nature. Our desire for that *Star Trek* universe. We will stumble, they will stumble, but mark my words, if they stumble, we help. They are here helping. Look at our sky is blue, and yeah, it's been blue for years now, but the microplastics the Sylvans are cleaning out for us. So be doom and gloom if you want. I'll stand on the side of beings doing better than their base urges.""

He set his empty beer bottle on the table with a firm, final click. The simple, unvarnished truth of his words hung in the air. He had just delivered his closing argument. Humanity wasn't a finished product, but a species that consciously chose to rise above its past. He wasn't a diplomat, a politician, or a general. He was a witness to his own species' progress, and he believed in it completely.

  
He took a final, contemplative puff from his cigar, the scent of the simple earthiness filling the sterile air of the command unit. He held their attention completely, every leader, every general, every alien diplomat.

""Now we've been in the black for over 6 months. I got at least 3 weeks of repairs, and I'm takin' a couple days to go campin'. Crews got lives, so some downtime for 'em. Now, I'll be back umm... Monday, on my ship, workin'.""

He pointed the cigar at the assembled group.

""Y'all wanna come visit, that's fine. If you show up and I hand you a wrench, well, we'll visit while ya work.""

He snuffed out the cigar in a small tray, the last wisp of smoke spiraling towards the ceiling. He turned, and without another word, walked out, leaving a room full of the most powerful beings in the galaxy in stunned, disbelieving silence.

The human leaders stared at the empty space where he had been. The man who just handed them the keys to the stars had left them for a camping trip. The Sylvan diplomat’s head tilted slightly, an elegant gesture of dawning understanding. The Kryll's internal lights pulsed rapidly, a final, profound data point entering its logic matrix: human diplomacy was not an abstract concept. It was a physical act. A shared responsibility. A wrench in your hand and a beer with a friend.

And with that, the Galactic Council's journey to understand humanity was no longer a mission of data analysis or political strategy. It had become a lesson in honest labor and the quiet, hard-earned dignity of a man named Elias. The future of the universe would be built on the deck of a freighter, one weld at a time.

The small campfire crackled, its light casting dancing shadows against the backdrop of pine trees. The cool night air of the Wyoming wilderness carried the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth. Elias Vance sat on a weathered log, a tin cup of coffee in his hand, gazing into the flames. He was a million miles away from the command unit and the chaos he had left behind.

He heard the rustle of leaves, a sound far too gentle to be any animal he knew. He looked up. From the shadowed treeline, the Sylvan diplomat emerged. Its form, a graceful cascade of living wood and soft light, seemed to absorb the starlight and glow faintly. It did not speak. It simply moved with a quiet dignity, its presence a silent question.

Elias just looked at him, and without a trace of surprise, he nodded. A simple gesture of welcome. The Sylvan, in turn, bowed its head slightly. It had come, as invited, not to a sterile meeting, but to a human ritual of quiet rest.

The Sylvan walked to the edge of the fire's light and knelt, a being of galactic renown now a silent companion to a man and his campfire. There was no need for words. The hum of the universe was in the rustle of leaves, and the weight of their new relationship was in the simple warmth of the fire. The shared silence was a treaty more profound than any document could ever be.

  
Elias took a slow sip of his coffee, his gaze fixed on the endless stars above. He gestured with the tin cup to the vast expanse. ""Out there is the adventure, the future, and here is a comfort, just nature."" He looked at the Sylvan, a genuine curiosity in his eyes. ""So how does Earth feel to you?""

The Sylvan was silent for a long moment, its soft inner light pulsing in rhythm with the gentle sway of the trees. It was a being of a different kind of life, one that felt the world as a complex tapestry of energy and biological presence.

""It feels... wild,"" the Sylvan's voice resonated, a soft, melodic hum that seemed to come from the very air itself. ""The life here is not as organized as on many worlds. It is chaotic and unpredictable. The emotional energy of your kind is immense, a powerful storm of joy and sorrow that thrums across the surface. I can feel the life of the soil, the breath of the wind through your trees, the rushing of the water in your rivers.""

The Sylvan knelt fully, its roots gently touching the earth. ""It feels... alive. In a way I have not felt anywhere else. There is a sadness to it, a memory of your struggles, but there is also a fierce hope. It feels like a place that has been through a great deal, but is still very, very young.""

The Sylvan lifted its head, looking at Elias, its light growing brighter. ""It feels, Captain, like a home that has been fought for.""

  
""Oh, it has,"" Elias said, his voice quiet but firm as he looked at the glowing Sylvan. ""It's been mistreated, burned, dumped on. But it's ours, and we got better at being shepherds for this world, so yeah, we might have fought each other for Earth, but now we try to do better.""

The Sylvan was silent, its inner light pulsing gently. It was the final piece of the puzzle, a perfect and beautiful answer. Elias had not just handed them archives and a philosophy; he had given them a story of a species that was imperfect, but was trying. The Sylvan could feel it—the deep, ancient scars of Earth, but also the fierce, protective love of the beings who now called it home.

The Galactic Council had sent them to find a reason, a motivation, an answer to the unquantifiable. They had found it in a man by a campfire, a simple man who loved his world and his crew so much he was willing to risk everything to protect them. The adventure of the stars was vast, but the truth of humanity was in the dirt beneath his boots and the warmth of the small fire between them. The great conversation was over. They had their answer.",1,1755754454.0,FreakFreakersonwrites,0,1.0,False

20:04; 06/09/2023; Ankara, Turkey. 

*Aryan and Meena both were RAW agents working in Turkey together for a data collecting mission. Aryan was the mission leader and Meena was an intel provider for him. Aryan and Meena were sitting outside in an open cafe keeping their eyes on the target which was right in front of them. Hotel GreenWorld.*

Aryan: “Well, We're fucked. Really really badly. It's a woman.” *He wears his earpiece and pulls out his morse code device.*

Meena: *She takes a peek at the woman in the red dress going into the restaurant.* “What?? You're sitting in front of one. Half of this planet is woman. Even the abomination called Cold Brew you're drinking is made by a woman. Then why can't a woman be an informer to our enemies?”

Aryan: “Hey…  are you stupid or on your periods?? She's a woman. Our plan was that we know they'll go into the bathroom for the information Exchange. And my plan was to steal the USB from them and leave. Now there's a woman and I can't go into the women's bathroom now.” *He uses his morse device to send a Mission abort request but he was stopped midway by Meena.*

Meena: “Haha…  darling. Don't fucking make that Period joke. That's sexiest and I'm going to cut off your dick again if I hear that. Understood?? Now Don't worry. I'm a woman. And I'll go and steal that drive. So put your coder down and trust in me. You're not the only spy here. I'm too. And I'm a better spy than you.” *Meena now stared at Aryan as she took the coder from his hands.*

Aryan: “Hey… Give me that back. I have to tell the intel department that she's a woman. And, you really think it's that easy?? You just go in there and come out with her stuff?? You're half the size of that woman & and this is your first mission. I'm more experienced and I'll decide.”

Meena: “Ohh.. Now I have to do it. You… you're really a narcissist. You think I can't do that because I'm a woman???
You know this is the problem with you and this department.""

Meena: You guys think women are liabilities you have to keep safe. And that's why your first mission was in Afghanistan and mine is in this dumbfuck land of Turkey. And don't forget we're pretending to be a couple for this mission. So now fucking smile,  I'm going into that restaurant. And I'll come back with that necklace. If I don't consider myself dead and be a male widow.” *Meena left and all Aryan could do was to stare at this form, she was never this angry during his teasing. But now she was in walking death for him.*

*After an hour she comes back. With a USB in her hands she waves at Aryan from a distance. He was getting more worried and gestured to her to come with him before that woman or her companions came to find us. After leaving that place both went to their room and plugged in the USB. And the videos of Drug Trade, Human Trafficking & Weapons Smuggling were clearly identified. Afterwards Aryan announced this to RAW headquarters and gave them all the intel regarding the incident and then the RAW person asked for Meena to talk to.*

RawS: “Hello Ms. Meena.   As we all know, your findings in this investigation by you two has given us many positives . We suspect these Turkish drones are being smuggled to Pakistan and these are kurds being trafficked. Now these concepts are really dangerous. And a woman working in foreign country as a spy on these things is not always a good idea. We are ready to send in the male equivalent of you. But this ultimate decision is in Aryan’s hands. You two can contact us when the decision is made.”

*The Chief hangs the phone. And now Aryan handed Meena a black coffee and came to the bed.*

Aryan: “You're a really good agent, Meena. You really did a lot of good things in this mission. But sorry because I don't think we'll be safe now. So I prefer that a man is standing behind me during a fight. Yet… if you want I'll let you be with me on this mission but the choice is yours. So choose wisely.",0,1755754380.0,india,0,0.27,False

Repetition is a constant with all gangstalkers.. not because it's tactical but because they are morons. you however are not. You will have to dumb yourself down to their level and fight their repetitiveness with your own countermeasures in the same likeness.  you are responsible for your brains programming not them. They can barely wipe their asses.. mainly because they dont.  They just sit and play sex games with you like you're some fuck avatar for them to sex traffic and neurologically rape.  do not let them  convince you that you are obligated to their system or at fault for it's torture methods.  if you weren't worth it they wouldn't waste the time. show them how worthless they are by shoving your value up their unwiped asses.
damn im dramatic as hell sometimes. but it's worth it. practice these,
you have only you to thank for it's success once you have come out of this a survivor. hopefully this will serve as a tactical mantra for you.

1mw2dm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1mw2dm2/getting_away_from_my_parents_is_even_more_hellish/,Getting away from my parents is even more hellish than expected.,"hoping this post fits the sub. Past 24 hours have been hell. 

I (18) have been working on a plan to escape my parents house for a while. My boyfriends parents, who live about 6 hours away, offered to let me move in. rent-free so I can focus on college without trying to juggle a job and classes. I'm also physically disabled with untreated mental health issues + very likely undiagnosed neurodivergent, which makes both school and working more difficult. 

I'm moving this Sunday. The original plan was mid-September, but recent events have made it need to happen ASAP. A big reason is my sibling (16) has a ton of health issues and can only eat select foods right now, and they need meal replacement shakes as well. Our parents, now, haven't grocery shopped in like a month in a half, so I'm having to eat less and less so my sibling has more of the foods they can eat. Our parents might go to the store once in a while for a couple of things or let my sibling and I walk to a convenience store near the house, but no real grocery shopping. It's not a money thing either. They can buy themselves alcohol or fast food and go out on date nights no problem. 

  
I told my mom about the move on Monday night. I waited to tell anyone because I knew how everyone would react. And what did my mom do? IMMEDIATELY tell my grandma and aunts. She also told my dad as soon as he got home from work. 

Tuesday morning I was cornered for information in the hallway while half awake. I was just up to pee and was going back to bed. My dad also used the same tone you would use to talk to a toddler that's in trouble, and said something about how if I didnt tell him things ""his plans go in to place"". Didnt elaborate on his ""plans"". He's hardly even looked at me since. 

  
Later that day, my aunt ""randomly"" made a gc and sent a text saying she would love to get coffee or dinner with my mom, grandma, and I. I had a hunch that this was related to my plans to move, but my mom (who orchestrated the whole thing) refused to tell me the reason we were going. I was essentially publicly humiliated in a Starbucks. It started normally, with them asking questions about my boyfriend, since my aunt and grandma didn't know I had a boyfriend (I don't like talking about my dating life and my family has a need to know everything about everything). Ended up with them giving me every reason they think I'm immature and stupid and selfish for moving. I didn't change my mind about going and they all lost it. They're convinced waiting to tell them means I don't care about my family. My aunt thinks if I go through with moving I should only be *allowed* to take things I bought myself...in her words, if I go through with a decision they don't support they don't want it to be comfortable for me at all. At one point she threatened to have everyone in the Starbucks vote on if my decision is a good one. She also called me a child for willingly relying on my boyfriend and his family financially and went on to talk about how she can work full time while doing college and raising a kid so I should be able to work and do college too. My mom thinks me moving is a way to self destruct (ironic, since I'm partially doing it to protect my mental health).

  
Today my mom tried to convince me to talk to a therapist about the move to get a ""professional, unbiased opinion"". I refused because this is a manipulation tactic. She should've gotten me help for obvious mental health issues YEARS ago, but couldn't be bothered. She only bothered to try when I decided to do something she disapproves of.",1,1755754309.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

There are a few PHP groups at this hospital, and each one seems to have patients with different issues. The people in my group are struggling with issues like suicidality, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. There's a different group for people dealing with things like psychosis and schizophrenia, and another one for people struggling with addiction. The program is generally decent, but the mid-morning activity therapy can be hit or miss, depending on the therapist. 

Yesterday's music therapist brought in essential oils and coffee filters, dabbing the filters with the oils and passing them around for us to smell. Over half the people in my group left the room because the smells were so strong. One girl couldn't stop coughing, and a couple other people complained about having headaches. The therapist described the different scents and then passed them around to us. She said they could be very calming. I'm overly agreeable and I can't stand awkward silence, so I offered that scent was a very primal sense, so it could affect us on a deep level. The therapist then started telling us about how her oils come from doTERRA because their oils are the purist, and then she talked to us about where we could buy doTERRA oils.

Both times we've had this therapist she's left early, once half an hour early in a one hour session, and another time 15 minutes early. She's also had us listen to pop songs and read the lyrics. This time she brought in ""Fireflies"" by Owl City, and just asked us what we thought about the song and lyrics. Frankly, it was an idiotic waste of time. I've seen better music therapists have us share our own music and explain what it meant to us, but this therapist wasn't interested in investing that much effort.

I know MLMs target vulnerable populations, but going after mental patients who are in crisis seems like a new low. Most participants in these PHP programs just transitioned out of being inpatient. I was familiar with MLMs because a girl I knew got sucked into Arbonne and through researching that I discovered this subreddit and YouTubers like Munecat, so when this incident happened I couldn't believe I was getting my first MLM presentation at a fucking mental hospital.",7,1755753843.0,antiMLM,3,1.0,False

has anyone ever been asked anything about subs wanting to be a human toilet or similar? like to actually physically defecate or urinate in someone’s mouth or in something for them? i have so many questions. is this even legal? i have one guy that’s been interested for MONTHS, calls me goddess and worships me in every message, is quite persistent but never once has been rude, sends me regular coffee contributions but nothing serious over the time we’ve spoken. i am simply confused on where to go with this.. i understand this an actual popular niche that people participate in willingly but is this something that can be pursued? should i even want to pursue this person hasn’t really wanted anything else, there have been touches of want/need for financial blackmail and findom included in our conversations. i actively participate in the findom community and utilise this niche in and for my content and conversations but blackmail and human toilets are new to me. the first few months i was just sussing out whether or not it was just someone trolling, but it is not and he’s rather serious.

is this too dangerous of a territory or a good weird little niche to utilise to make money with little or no harm done? am i putting myself in a hole at all by entertaining him and these interests?",2,1755753809.0,CreatorsAdvice,2,0.75,False

20:04; 06/09/2023; Ankara, Turkey. 

*Aryan and Meena both were RAW agents working in Turkey together for a data collecting mission. Aryan was the mission leader and Meena was an intel provider for him. Aryan and Meena were sitting outside in an open cafe keeping their eyes on the target which was right in front of them. Hotel GreenWorld.*

Aryan: “Well, We're fucked. Really really badly. It's a woman.” *He wears his earpiece and pulls out his morse code device.*

Meena: *She takes a peek at the woman in the red dress going into the restaurant.* “What?? You're sitting in front of one. Half of this planet is woman. Even the abomination called Cold Brew you're drinking is made by a woman. Then why can't a woman be an informer to our enemies?”

Aryan: “Hey…  are you stupid or on your periods?? She's a woman. Our plan was that we know they'll go into the bathroom for the information Exchange. And my plan was to steal the USB from them and leave. Now there's a woman and I can't go into the women's bathroom now.” *He uses his morse device to send a Mission abort request but he was stopped midway by Meena.*

Meena: “Haha…  darling. Don't fucking make that Period joke. That's sexiest and I'm going to cut off your dick again if I hear that. Understood?? Now Don't worry. I'm a woman. And I'll go and steal that drive. So put your coder down and trust in me. You're not the only spy here. I'm too. And I'm a better spy than you.” *Meena now stared at Aryan as she took the coder from his hands.*

Aryan: “Hey… Give me that back. I have to tell the intel department that she's a woman. And, you really think it's that easy?? You just go in there and come out with her stuff?? You're half the size of that woman & and this is your first mission. I'm more experienced and I'll decide.”

Meena: “Ohh.. Now I have to do it. You… you're really a narcissist. You think I can't do that because I'm a woman???
You know this is the problem with you and this department.""

Meena: You guys think women are liabilities you have to keep safe. And that's why your first mission was in Afghanistan and mine is in this dumbfuck land of Turkey. And don't forget we're pretending to be a couple for this mission. So now fucking smile,  I'm going into that restaurant. And I'll come back with that necklace. If I don't consider myself dead and be a male widow.” *Meena left and all Aryan could do was to stare at this form, she was never this angry during his teasing. But now she was in walking death for him.*

*After an hour she comes back. With a USB in her hands she waves at Aryan from a distance. He was getting more worried and gestured to her to come with him before that woman or her companions came to find us. After leaving that place both went to their room and plugged in the USB. And the videos of Drug Trade, Human Trafficking & Weapons Smuggling were clearly identified. Afterwards Aryan announced this to RAW headquarters and gave them all the intel regarding the incident and then the RAW person asked for Meena to talk to.*

RawS: “Hello Ms. Meena.   As we all know, your findings in this investigation by you two has given us many positives . We suspect these Turkish drones are being smuggled to Pakistan and these are kurds being trafficked. Now these concepts are really dangerous. And a woman working in foreign country as a spy on these things is not always a good idea. We are ready to send in the male equivalent of you. But this ultimate decision is in Aryan’s hands. You two can contact us when the decision is made.”

*The Chief hangs the phone. And now Aryan handed Meena a black coffee and came to the bed.*

Aryan: “You're a really good agent, Meena. You really did a lot of good things in this mission. But sorry because I don't think we'll be safe now. So I prefer that a man is standing behind me during a fight. Yet… if you want I'll let you be with me on this mission but the choice is yours.

1mw24df,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mw24df,Talon Squadron: Wings of the First - Chapters 2 & 3,"# Chapters 2 & 3 — Holding Pattern & Break Contact

We’re posting a bit sooner than we said before AND doubling up this week with two chapters released together:

After their first patrol ended under unusual orders, Talon Squadron finds themselves grounded, watching and waiting while Command keeps its cards close. Instead of returning to Concord Station, the Wing’s central hub, Talon had been ordered to remain forward-deployed on Gagarin.

The official reason was “joint operations readiness” — maintaining a visible JSEDC presence alongside UC forces already entrenched in the Alpha Centauri system. Unofficially, Kaelen suspected Command wanted Talon close to the heart of the UC’s core worlds. If something rattled the core, Talon would be in position to respond within minutes.

But waiting never lasts long in the 1st Expeditionary Wing…

\----------------------------------

# Chapter 2 – Holding Pattern

  
Kaelen “Ironhand” Varrick didn’t like waiting.

Talon Squadron’s Raptors sat in a neat line along Bay Three of Gagarin’s primary flight hangar, landing struts locked, thruster housings still wicking off faint curls of coolant vapor. The recent patrol had ended early, and no one in Command had offered a reason. That, more than the unexplained spike in Sector Four, was what itched at the back of his mind.

He stood at the base of his ship’s boarding ladder, helmet clipped to his hip. The coolant cycle was nearly finished, residual white vapor coiling lazily from the recessed vents over the landing gear before dissipating into the filtered hangar air.

“Tell me again why we’re not chasing this thing?”

Lieutenant Rina “Falcon” Tessaro leaned on the ladder rail beside him, still in her flightsuit. Her tone was conversational, but the edge was there.

Kaelen shrugged. “Because Command says so.”

“That’s not an answer,” she said.

Across the bay, Wildcat was holding court, animatedly recounting a maneuver from the patrol to a pair of Viper Squadron pilots. Halo was in the ordnance prep area of her ship, going over a sensor calibration with a ground tech. Sureshot leaned against a cargo crate, arms folded, watching the others with that faint, knowing smirk of his.

Dre De Champ strode past in his crisp officer’s jacket, data slate tucked under one arm. He slowed just enough to glance at Wildcat mid-gesture and shook his head with an exaggerated roll of his eyes.  
“Careful, Renn. If talking counted as flight hours, you’d be leading the Wing by now.”

A ripple of quiet laughter spread from the Viper pilots. Wildcat flushed, but his grin never faded. Dre kept moving without breaking stride, disappearing toward the command offices.

Kaelen glanced across the hangar at the wide viewport overlooking Gagarin’s apron. This wasn’t Concord Station (the JSEDC's Headquarters), and that was half the point. Officially, the Dauntless II, along with Talon and Viper squadrons were here for joint readiness drills with UC forces — training rotations close to the core. Unofficially, Kaelen suspected Command wanted their two sharpest squadrons parked in Alpha Centauri, close enough to the spotlight to reassure the UC brass of their investment, but still within striking distance if frontier trouble bled inward. Gagarin’s staging facilities made it easy to hide a scramble order under the cover of “routine drills.”

The sound of boots on deck drew Kaelen’s attention. Commander Hale, the Dauntless II’s air wing coordinator, approached with a data slate in hand, the JSEDC insignia gleaming on his shoulder patch.

“Your squadron’s on standby until further notice,” Hale said. “Maintain ten-minute launch readiness.”

Kaelen kept his voice neutral. “Sector Four?”

“Not your concern,” Hale replied flatly. Which, Kaelen thought, meant it was definitely his concern.

The squadron mess hall on Gagarin wasn’t much to look at — steel panel walls, exposed conduit, and a single viewport with a hazy view of the spaceport’s east landing apron. The coffee tasted like reactor coolant, and the seats were just comfortable enough to keep people from standing.

Wildcat was retelling his maneuver again, Falcon half-listening while scanning the room. Halo sat with a portable sensor drone in pieces before her, fine tools laid out in neat rows. Sureshot was chewing through a protein bar with the patience of a man waiting for something to happen.

Kaelen set his mug down at the table. “Command’s locking down all comm traffic to the Wing.”

Halo looked up sharply. “Locking down?”

“As in encrypted-only channels,” Kaelen said. “No open chatter, no outbound without clearance.”

Falcon leaned in. “Why are they being so weird?!”

Kaelen didn’t answer. He took another sip of the bitter coffee and let the silence hang.

The launch alarm came just after oh-nine-hundred.  
Red strobes flashed across the mess hall bulkhead. Overhead, the intercom barked orders, voices sharp.

Kaelen was already moving. The squadron filed into the hangar, helmets in hand. Ground crews scrambled, clearing fueling umbilicals and rolling ordnance carts back behind safety lines. Vapor vented from coolant exhausts in thick white plumes, billowing around the Raptors’ landing gear as systems cycled to launch-ready.

Hale’s voice hit over the encrypted channel.  
“Talon Squadron, scramble. This is not a drill.”

Kaelen took the ladder two rungs at a time, ducked through the ordnance bay, crossed the narrow living space, and slid into the cockpit. Restraints locked. Systems hummed alive, HUD blooming to life.

“Launch vector?” he asked over comms.

“Sector Four,” Hale replied.

And this time, no one was holding them back.

\----------------------------------

# Chapter 3 – Break Contact

  
The Raptors of Talon Squadron rose on pillars of light.  
  
VTOL thrusters flared, white-hot against the dark grey deck, as each fighter lifted clear of its berth. Kaelen’s SH-RPT-160 vibrated through his seat harness, the inertial dampers compensating just enough to keep the launch forces tolerable.

Coolant vapor streamed off the landing gear as the gear retracted. One last vent cycle hissed out over the aft struts before the ship locked into flight mode.

“Form up on me,” Kaelen ordered, voice level.

The hangar mouth dropped away beneath them, and the high walls of the launch corridor gave way to open sky. Gagarin’s pale-blue atmosphere stretched to the horizon. Kaelen angled his nose upward, feeling the familiar push in his chest as acceleration built. The Raptors surged in unison, their drives screaming into the thin air before breaking into the silence of vacuum.

The black of space wrapped around them, broken only by the faint glint of starlight and the dim blue curve of Gagarin below. Kaelen’s HUD tagged their destination: Sector Four — two thousand kilometers ahead, low orbit.

“Falcon, take Sureshot high,” Kaelen said. “Wildcat, stay on my wing. Halo, you’re our eyes.”

“Copy,” Falcon replied, already pulling into a climbing arc with Sureshot trailing.

Halo’s voice was calm but tight. “Contact resolved — one primary, small displacement, running low power. Could be a stealth-configured hull.”

Kaelen adjusted his vector. “Bearing?”

“Zero-four-nine, positive lock.”

The faint glimmer of a ship materialized on his HUD — a lean silhouette against the black, half-hidden by shadow. Whoever they were, they weren’t broadcasting transponder codes.

“Talon Lead, Dauntless,” the command channel cracked to life. “You are cleared to intercept and identify. Rules of engagement: hold fire unless fired upon.”

Kaelen’s jaw flexed. “Understood.”

The gap closed fast. Kaelen could make out the vessel’s heat signature now, a residual shimmer where drives had recently throttled down. The shape was wrong for any civilian courier — more angular, with recessed engine cowls and ventral hardpoints.

Halo’s sensors chirped. “Lead, I’m getting a weapons lock on us — light missile tracking. They’re painting us but not firing.”

“Not yet,” Kaelen muttered.

The comms lit with an unexpected voice — clipped, confident, almost amused.  
“You’re a long way from the rest of your Wing, Talon Squadron.”

Falcon broke in. “Unidentified vessel, state your name and intent.”

A short laugh. “Names are currency, Lieutenant. And I don’t hand mine out for free.”

Kaelen felt the tension coil. “Squadron, defensive spread. Assume they’re testing us.”

The contact flared drives and banked hard, breaking away from their intercept vector.

“Lead, he’s running!” Wildcat shouted.

“Then let’s see if he can outfly a Raptor,” Kaelen said, shoving the throttle forward.

The chase slammed into full burn. Kaelen’s fighter knifed through the dark, drive wake trailing like a comet’s tail. The target’s profile danced across his HUD, weaving and rolling to bleed pursuit vectors.

For the briefest moment, Kaelen considered calling in Viper Squadron. Their newly deployed Wraiths were blisteringly fast — interceptors built to close gaps like this in seconds. But the thought of handing Falcon and his Talons bragging rights to Rylen Thorne and his Wraith jockeys? Not a chance. This was still *their* fight.

He grinned under his helmet. “We’ll manage just fine.”

Halo’s tone shifted — that rare mix of urgency and certainty. “Lead, second contact just lit up behind us — bigger displacement, multiple launch signatures!”

Falcon’s voice sharpened over comms. “We’ve got company.”

Kaelen’s gut went cold. Whoever the first pilot was, he wasn’t alone. This wasn’t a simple intercept.

“Break formation,” Kaelen ordered, his voice low but cutting through the channel. “All Talons — break contact, disengage toward rally point Bravo. We’ll regroup and re-engage on my mark.”

Somewhere behind them, the second contact’s drives roared to life, and Kaelen knew they’d just stumbled into something planned — and it wasn’t meant to end in a clean intercept.",2,1755753445.0,StarhawkIndustries,0,1.0,False

A sunrise on a new day — surely that is heaven. A sunset on any day but one — surely that is hell. 


In the mornings I pull the two-by-fours off of my windows and I rip the garbage bags that sat behind them off as well. I let the morning sunrise come into the room and I admire it softly. 


In the evenings, around six pm, sometimes later, I put it all back up. I make sure I am not outside during the sunset and I make sure my entire house is blacked out. There is the cerulean of blue hour, there is the orange of a new day, there is the yellow-white of noon, and then there is night time. I have banished a sunset from my existence. 


In fact I just bought one plane ticket, one-way to Juneau, Alaska. I went there once for work and the sun never rose nor did it set. It was always deep blue no matter the time of day. I would stand, boats bobbing away in the lake, and I would drink coffee and sigh heavily. What a relief it will be when I die there, never having seen a sunset again. 


The last sunset I ever saw was two Januarys ago and I surely would like to keep it that way. The phone call came in a blacked out room. I put on my clothes and set out immediately for Mesa. 


I got in the car as sunset was beginning and through my drive the sun lowered and lowered itself. It warmed up as it fell and I saw the deepest red I’d ever seen. The most beautiful, cursive, Neapolitan sky god has ever made. You were not there, but I saw you all over it. God could not come up with such a design unless he had someone as smart as you to suggest it. I think God was happy to have the help that day, and he may have even been able to learn some things from you if not for his ego. 
You don’t believe in God, I know. So how did you make that sunset?



When I arrived in Mesa it was finished and the night took its shift. 



I saw my mother, my brother, and my aunt standing outside the house. 



I went inside and saw you on the floor. 



So how did you make that sunset?

1mw21k4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeInc2/comments/1mw21k4/political_strategy_guide/,POLITICAL STRATEGY GUIDE,"
Noticed a lot of people seem to prefer turning off politics (in settings), however, meddling in foreign elections can be quite fun in the later stages of the game! Whether you are exploring M&A’s, cost-cutting options or just looking for something else to do, politics can be an exciting challenge to take on, especially, if you have an abundance of cash! Most of this is pretty common sense, but there are some nuisances and strategy + luck involved! 

                              -Mayor Elections-

Politics are centered on the Mayor Elections. Mayors will have a lean towards the: left (liberal), middle (moderate), and right (conservative) on the attributes below.  

Based on the attribute spectrum, mayors will push the laws or repeals below to the assembly.

- Socialism vs Capitalism = Anti-Trust Laws
- Small vs Big Government = Taxes
- Environmentalism vs Economic Freedom = Green Laws
- Equality vs Traditional = Gender Equality Law

Mayor elections influence
-  The What?  - Which laws or repeals are introduced to assembly first.
- The When? - The frequency of assembly elections 
- The How? - Final say on the laws that are ultimately enacted

If the mayors have a strong slant towards one end of the spectrum for all or most of the attributes, this will impact how frequently laws / repeals are introduced to the assembly. These are “activist” mayors that will start introducing laws or repeals very quickly.  Generally, the assembly tends to reach the majority votes needed to pass a bill thru the assembly, especially without donating.

Occasionally, Mayors will refuse to sign or block a law and it’s sent back to the assembly for a rare supermajority poll. [I’ve seen a blocked bill overridden via a supermajority vote only once.] Usually, it’s a moderate mayor that will initially block a law or repeal.

###Most importantly, target Mayors = 
- Right-Wing
- Activist (strong slant on most attributes)
- Capitalist & Traditionalist Attributes

[Quick note: Psyops don’t appear to work. I have not seen any evidence that competing coffee companies ever pay fines in the game - so I never advocate trying to install a left-wing mayor to sabotage another company into paying fines.]

                                -Terms / Cycles-

Mayor elections are cyclical. Most cities have elections every 4-years but others have 5 or 6 year terms.  A news update will appear 37-weeks from the election date (when polls close). The start / close dates & the terms (in years) are posted for every city below.

The election kick-off is your signal to start donating towards favorable candidates. Pay attention to the polls during those weeks and after donating.  

The game starts off with mayor elections in Chicago, Madrid & Seattle in 2023. The 2030-2031 elections are critical and are one of the most important periods for politics in the game. Despite the varying terms (cycles), every city will happen to have an election, back to back to back, during those years. By this time you should also have a good amount of cash to spend on these elections.

###Most importantly, target the: 
- Start Date (37-weeks from Election Date)
- 2030-2031 election seasons.

#-Donations-

Political donations can significantly influence the results of the elections. While amount is important, the frequency of donations are even more important. Donating $5M weekly will result in better polls than $15M every three weeks. You can donate multiple times to any candidate in increments of $5M. 

###Most importantly, target the donation: 
-  Frequency > $ Amount

#-Polls-

Incumbents are generally favored in most elections. [I’ve noticed that moderates tend to face off against other moderates while activist tend to illicit activists from the other end of the spectrum.] Though, the entire process is pretty random, and polls are completely refreshed if the start date is repeated (save the week before the kick-off dates). 

If the preferred candidate is in first or second place according to the polls it’s usually best to only donate to the preferred candidate. If the preferred candidate is in third place, it’s best to still mostly donate to the preferred candidate but also with light donations to other candidates. 

This is where you can donate to a, low polling, left-wing mayor to pull more votes away from the top two candidates. This will decrease the poll numbers  for every candidate, but provide an opening for the third place person to jump ahead due to slimmer margins.  Once in second place, only donate to the preferred choice. 

If there is a >20% difference between the 1st & 2nd place candidate, according to the polls, it’s going to be extremely challenging to defeat the 1st place candidate. Conversely, if your preferred candidate has a 20% margin, you won’t have to donate much, if anything, to be successful. 

###Most importantly, polls show favorable mayor in:
- 1st or 2nd place = donate to preferred mayor only
- <3rd place = donate to multiple candidates 

Polling margins =
- <5%  = Toss up
- 5% - 10% = Close 
- 10% - 20%= Comfortable
- >>20% = Safe

#-Assembly Elections-


This is usually the last chance to stop a law. Just like mayor elections, you can donate multiple times a week in increments of $5M. These law elections are random but will happen more frequently with an activist mayor. The voting results also typically favor the political leanings of the mayor. 

Once 51 votes are in it’s usually all but settled, but if a mayor blocks a law, the law is sent back for supermajority vote, which are not very successful. 

Just because a bill is voted down does not mean it goes away. There is a strong chance that the bill will be reintroduced to the assembly at some point so watch the news for political alerts. Usually, cities will work their way up towards the most damaging Anti-trust ($1.2-$2.5B+ Fine) and Gender Equality ($1M+ Fine) laws but that’s not always true. 

###Most importantly:
- pay attention to the news especially when Anti-Trust or Gender Equality laws or repeals are mentioned. ",1,1755753183.0,CoffeInc2,0,1.0,False

But the more I pushed, the more anxious and scattered I felt.

Recently I started shifting to “less, but with intention.” Each week I add one simple practice, like:

* Drinking water before coffee in the morning
* Taking 3 mindful breaths before starting work
* Putting my phone down for 10 minutes before bed

These little shifts made my days feel calmer and more meaningful, even though on paper I was “doing less.”

I came across a short weekly newsletter called The Quiet Hustle that shares practical mindset shifts and micro-habits like this. It’s not about hustle culture, it’s about calm, clarity, and steady progress. It reminded me that simple living isn’t about doing nothing, it’s about doing the right things, more gently.

Lurked on main, first time active!

I'm posting in search of an accountability partner (or partners) to work alongside through the early stages of channel set-up. I'll be making content on the craft, design and commentary side of things, and would love to work with folks in the same or similar areas.

It looks I'll have from early September until the end of October to commit almost solely to getting a channel started. Going about it with others would be way more fun and likely to succeed, so here we are.

I'm very organized when it comes to accountability partnerships or groups, and happy to provide the structure for meetings, goals and challenges to get us started if that's easiest. That said, I'm ideally looking for partners(s) who have the time, discipline and good nature to show up regularly and communicate consistently, as I'm not looking to chase anyone down or sit in an empty discord chat room waiting to see if they'll show. Three check-ins a month (every ten days) would be an great place to start for me (happy to adjust for the right fit!), with specific goals laid out to work on in the interim and quick online check-ins every so often to stay on track. If that sounds like a lot, let me assure you I'm actually very easy going in real life, having a written structure just makes things a million times easier when it comes to getting something started! 

In a perfect world, it would be great to have other partners in Canada! We can have a little e-coffee to get a feel for whether the partnership will work out or not before making any further plans.

Opening Scene: Ethos is behind the counter, looking way too serious for someone scanning cough drops. He’s wearing his samurai gi under a Fo’ Real Meds vest like it’s the most natural uniform combo in the world. Peacekeeper’s at the register next to him, aggressively chewing gum like he’s on a battlefield.

First Customer: A random old lady waddles up and asks, “Do you sell herbal supplements that prevent mind control from the government?” Ethos, dead serious: “Yes, ma’am. It’s called turning off the television.” Peacekeeper leans in: “Also available in gummies.”

Breakroom Banter: The breakroom has a coffee machine that hisses like a dying dragon, and the fridge is permanently sticky. Ethos is in the middle of drinking his black coffee (“The Monk’s Sip”) when Peacekeeper busts in with a crate of random overstock items, saying, “Corporate said we gotta upsell these or else they send them to the dumpster.” Ethos looks inside. It’s… nothing but inflatable thermometers. Ethos: “…For what illness?” Peacekeeper: “Confidence.”

Running Gag: Every time Ethos tries to have a quiet, philosophical moment about “honor in the workplace,” an intercom announcement interrupts: “Attention Fo’ Real Meds shoppers… whoever keeps hiding live crabs in the cold medicine aisle—stop.”

Climactic Scene: A Karen storms in, demanding a refund for medicine she already used. Peacekeeper is ready to duel verbally, but Ethos steps in, doing an overly dramatic samurai bow: “Madam, the remedy you seek… is humility.” Karen: “WHAT does that mean?!” Peacekeeper: “It means no refund.”",1,1755752553.0,story,0,1.0,False
1mw1udw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TraditionalExtent363/comments/1mw1udw/reusable_chopsticks_straws_stylish_accessories/,Reusable Chopsticks & Straws: Stylish Accessories for a Sustainable Lifestyle,"In today’s world, more people are choosing eco-friendly habits that not only reduce waste but also look stylish in daily life. Among the most popular choices are reusable chopsticks and reusable straws. These accessories are no longer just functional—they have become sustainable dining essentials for eco-conscious families and travelers across Canada, USA, and Europe.  


At u10sils, we focus on creating durable, reusable dining accessories like [stainless steel chopsticks, stainless steel straws, and Tritan straws](https://u10sils.com/collections/accessories) (available in both clear and black). These products are designed to make sustainable living easy, whether you’re at home, at work, or enjoying a meal on the go.  


Why Switch to Reusable Chopsticks & Straws?  


The shift from disposable to reusable is more than just a lifestyle trend—it’s about protecting the planet. Plastic waste is one of the biggest contributors to pollution. By choosing reusable dining accessories, you:  


* Reduce single-use plastic consumption 
* Save money by reusing instead of buying disposables
* Make eco-conscious living part of your everyday routine

For families and individuals in West Coast regions like BC, Portland, and California, reusable accessories are not only practical but also a reflection of sustainable values.

Reusable Chopsticks: Tradition Meets Sustainability  
1. A Modern Take on a Timeless Tool  


Chopsticks have been used for centuries, but reusable stainless steel chopsticks take them to a new level of convenience. Unlike wooden or plastic versions, they are:

* Durable and long-lasting 
* Easy to clean
* Resistant to staining and odors

2. Perfect for Travel & Daily Use  


Whether you’re eating sushi at home or enjoying takeout in the office, reusable chopsticks are lightweight, portable, and easy to carry in a cutlery case.  


3. Stylish Dining Experience  


Many people are now choosing chopsticks as part of a modern dining accessory set. At u10sils, our designs bring both functionality and elegance to your table.

Stainless Steel Straws: Strong, Sleek & Sustainable  
1. Why Stainless Steel?  


Plastic straws are among the most harmful single-use items. Stainless steel straws are a smarter choice because they are:

* Durable (won’t break or bend) 
* Reusable (can last for years)
* Stylish (sleek design that matches any dining setup)

2. Easy to Carry Anywhere  


Perfect for iced coffee, smoothies, or cocktails, these straws fit into travel pouches and are ideal for anyone who wants an eco-friendly option while dining out in Canada, the USA, or Europe.

3. Eco-Conscious Lifestyle Choice  


For families aiming to reduce plastic, stainless steel straws are a small but powerful step towards sustainability.

Tritan Straws: Clear & Black Options for Everyday Dining  
1. What is Tritan?  


Tritan is a BPA-free, durable material that’s safe for food and drink use. Unlike plastic straws, Tritan straws don’t degrade easily and are dishwasher-safe.

2. Clear & Black Designs  


At u10sils, we offer both clear Tritan straws for a sleek, minimal look and black Tritan straws for those who want a bold dining accessory.

3. Everyday Practicality  


Tritan straws are lightweight, making them perfect for kids, travel, and everyday drinks. They are also a great alternative for people who prefer something different from stainless steel.

Accessories That Match Your Lifestyle  


Reusable accessories aren’t just about sustainability—they also match today’s modern lifestyle. Whether you’re packing a lunchbox, hosting a dinner party, or traveling through Europe or the West Coast, these accessories are:

* Convenient 
* Stylish 
* Designed for everyday use

At u10sils, our mission is to make sustainable dining practical and fashionable.

The Bigger Impact of Small Changes  


When you choose reusable chopsticks and straws, you’re making a small change that creates a big impact:

* Less plastic in oceans and landfills 
* Reduced carbon footprint
* More conscious consumption 

For eco-conscious families in Canada, USA, and Europe, these accessories represent a lifestyle choice that goes beyond dining—it’s about creating a sustainable future.

1mw1p76,https://i.redd.it/nd7k3kr50bkf1.jpeg,Parry's Cake Day (posting this here too since this is my first time I finished writing a story based on their lore.),"Parry finally got to his house after a tiring day of taking on multiple jobs like almost every day. He feels fortunate that he got inside even when it's so dark in the area where his nearest house is located. It is quite isolated but it was the nearest from his last work. Only he knows the place so far so it is quiet and lonely.  
He did bring home a piece of a cake he made that is his favorite, chilled cookies and cream, from the cake factory. He just dropped by just to revisit it. He didn't even realize it was his cake day until they told him it was. He placed the cake on the table in front of the living room couch and sat on the couch. He's all alone in this house.  
He sat silently, contemplating about how long he's been... existing. Everyday has been feeling the same despite not always doing the same kind of work. Hours upon hours of work, day after day, it never seems to end. Just to earn a lot for... what? There is not even a way to put all of what he has in one place. He's been thinking if all of the things he's done have been worth the time. Although it feels like he's only been wasting time.

The cake is melting, he's only been staring at it as he is in deep thought. The cookie crumbles slowly fall down the melty slopes of cream and frosting. Covering some like a slow avalanche. The piece of cake is looking less like a cake and more a crumbling mess.  
Oh, whoops, he was suppose to eat the cake. He snaps out of his thoughts and finally starts eating it before it melts into a puddle. The cake is now out of shape, even if he refreezes it that won't put it back together as well as it was newly baked. He may have added a bit too much sugar that it tastes a bit more sweeter than he preferred. Still edible at room temperature at least, he can't complain about that.

As the cake was finished. He lays down on the couch. Feeling drowsy but still a bit hesitant to fall asleep right away. He is unsure if he'll have another vivid nightmare again. Wondering why he's been getting them more recently. He does miss that he used to have more fun dreams before. Those that he felt like were memories from a distant past, a different life even.  
Maybe it was from hearing a lot about how others described how things were like before in Robloxia in the previous decades. Maybe it really was a previous life that he is unsure how it ended, or even why the reason why he went back as what he is right now. He does wish of going back to that time and find out what he felt was missing. But he knows that won't be possible nor could not be the same if he tried.

He closes his eyes, hoping to get at least a dreamless sleep instead, trying to not think about anything too much. He was about to fall into a deep sleep until the doorbell. He falls off the couch but quickly helped himself back up with the coffee table. There is a warm light that may be from a fire shining from the windows besides the door. As he walks towards the door the light leaves and fading footsteps are heard. He opens the door and he cannot see whoever or whatever that was anymore. On the doorstep there was a greeting card standing upright and a present box. He quickly picks it up after seeing that the surrounding is safe and immediately closes and locks the door.

He's surprised that someone else also remembered his cake day. Also a bit scared that someone else knows of the house and quickly left. Or could they have been mistaken with the address and accidentally left the greeting card and the present?

He inspects the greeting card, the words are written with red crayons and a cake slice with a candle was drawn. At a corner, ""From: Tip "" is written, which he does not remember who that is as the name is unfamiliar. He opens the greeting card carefully. It really is addressed to him.

Hi Parry!  
Happy Cake Day to you :3  
You've been working quite a lot lately. You must be very tired and hungry from all that. I wanted to give you something else but all I can get and make right now is S'mores. I am still trying to learn how to make other things and there is a lot of places I want you to see too! That is if you want to and you're not too busy.  
You probably don't recognize my name but I am the one who has some of your horses. I'd actually like to give them back to you them since I almost got obliterated from an incident so it's probably safer if you get them back from me \^ \^;  
I'm sorry if I can't show myself for now so I'll leave you this card I made and S'mores in the gift box.  
I hope we finally get so see each other again someday! :D  
\-----

He remembers someone that he had entrusted with some of his horses before. He hasn't visited his other horse from another place a long while either. They are probably doing fine even if he had been gone for a long time, hopefully. Although it'll be more work again since there wouldn't be enough space for the horses to be given back to him.  
He tries to recall anything else about who he gave his other horse to but nothing else comes up. It's strange how he can't remember much about who the person he had trusted before and they even know where this isolated place is.

Before he spirals again he decides to open the present box. Inside there is the S'mores. They still feel warm and fresh, they look and smell nice as well. A bite of it gives a taste of a nice roasted fluffy marshmallow between the tasty graham crackers and sweet chocolate. It's actually not been long since he last ate S'mores but the gifted ones does tastes more like the nights of peaceful camping in the woods underneath the stars.  
It calms him, he is very grateful of the gift. Whoever Tip is really didn't have to do all this but he is happy he has a friend that cares, even if it the way they reached out was startling. He ate the rest of the S'mores happily.

He went to his bed so that he can sleep more comfortably. Maybe this time he'll have a new dream again. If not then maybe he could face the nightmares head on. It's best to sleep as tomorrow is going to be another day. He'll be needing a lot of energy for tomorrow's work and finding who ever Tip truly is. He falls asleep, waiting for the dream to come and the sun to rise.

I finally tried writing and finished a story. Hooray!

Btw his cake day is August 20 in my time zone and I did just realized it was his cake day late at night so I just continued writing this today instead. My own birthday is actually in August 31 so it's near too. Not sure if I'll do something for it but sure I'll try to think of what to do for this subreddit.

By the fourth or fifth day, something clicked. I caught myself looking for small positives during the day because I knew I’d have to write something down later. Suddenly, things I would’ve ignored, like a stranger holding the door or catching a nice sunset, stood out more.

It wasn’t a huge shift, but it made my days feel lighter. That simple act of noticing changed how I moved through the day. Funny how something that takes 2 minutes at night can rewire how you see the world.",2,1755751886.0,positivepsychology,1,1.0,False
1mw1mmp,https://i.redd.it/ygr99iz3wakf1.jpeg,A short story about Parry because it was his Cake Day,"   Parry finally got to his house after a tiring day of taking on multiple jobs like almost every day. He feels fortunate that he got inside even when it's so dark in the area where his nearest house is located. It is quite isolated but it was the nearest from his last work. Only he knows the place so far so it is quiet and lonely.  
   He did bring home a piece of a cake he made that is his favorite, chilled cookies and cream, from the cake factory. He just dropped by just to revisit it. He didn't even realize it was his cake day until they told him it was. He placed the cake on the table in front of the living room couch and sat on the couch. He's all alone in this house.  
   He sat silently, contemplating about how long he's been... existing. Everyday has been feeling the same despite not always doing the same kind of work. Hours upon hours of work, day after day, it never seems to end. Just to earn a lot for... what? There is not even a way to put all of what he has in one place. He's been thinking if all of the things he's done have been worth the time. Although it feels like he's only been wasting time.

  
   The cake is melting, he's only been staring at it as he is in deep thought. The cookie crumbles slowly fall down the melty slopes of cream and frosting. Covering some like a slow avalanche. The piece of cake is looking less like a cake and more a crumbling mess.  
   Oh, whoops, he was suppose to eat the cake. He snaps out of his thoughts and finally starts eating it before it melts into a puddle. The cake is now out of shape, even if he refreezes it that won't put it back together as well as it was newly baked. He may have added a bit too much sugar that it tastes a bit more sweeter than he preferred. Still edible at room temperature at least, he can't complain about that.

  
   As the cake was finished. He lays down on the couch. Feeling drowsy but still a bit hesitant to fall asleep right away. He is unsure if he'll have another vivid nightmare again. Wondering why he's been getting them more recently. He does miss that he used to have more fun dreams before. Those that he felt like were memories from a distant past, a different life even.   
   Maybe it was from hearing a lot about how others described how things were like before in Robloxia in the previous decades. Maybe it really was a previous life that he is unsure how it ended, or even why the reason why he went back as what he is right now. He does wish of going back to that time and find out what he felt was missing. But he knows that won't be possible nor could not be the same if he tried.

  
   He closes his eyes, hoping to get at least a dreamless sleep instead, trying to not think about anything too much. He was about to fall into a deep sleep until the doorbell. He falls off the couch but quickly helped himself back up with the coffee table. There is a warm light that may be from a fire shining from the windows besides the door. As he walks towards the door the light leaves and fading footsteps are heard. He opens the door and he cannot see whoever or whatever that was anymore. On the doorstep there was a greeting card standing upright and a present box. He quickly picks it up after seeing that the surrounding is safe and immediately closes and locks the door.

  
   He's surprised that someone else also remembered his cake day. Also a bit scared that someone else knows of the house and quickly left. Or could they have been mistaken with the address and accidentally left the greeting card and the present? 

  
He inspects the greeting card, the words are written with red crayons and a cake slice with a candle was drawn. At a corner, ""From: Tip "" is written, which he does not remember who that is as the name is unfamiliar. He opens the greeting card carefully. It really is addressed to him.

  
*-----*  
Hi Parry!  
Happy Cake Day to you :3  
You've been working quite a lot lately. You must be very tired and hungry from all that. I wanted to give you something else but all I can get and make right now is S'mores. I am still trying to learn how to make other things and there is a lot of places I want you to see too! That is if you want to and you're not too busy.  
You probably don't recognize my name but I am the one who has some of your horses. I'd actually like to give them back to you them since I almost got obliterated from an incident so it's probably safer if you get them back from me \^ \^;  
I'm sorry if I can't show myself for now so I'll leave you this card I made and S'mores in the gift box.   
I hope we finally get so see each other again someday! :D  
\-----

  
  He remembers someone that he had entrusted with some of his horses before. He hasn't visited his other horse from another place a long while either. They are probably doing fine even if he had been gone for a long time, hopefully. Although it'll be more work again since there wouldn't be enough space for the horses to be given back to him.  
  He tries to recall anything else about who he gave his other horse to but nothing else comes up. It's strange how he can't remember much about who the person he had trusted before and they even know where this isolated place is.

  
   Before he spirals again he decides to open the present box. Inside there is the S'mores. They still feel warm and fresh, they look and smell nice as well. A bite of it gives a taste of a nice roasted fluffy marshmallow between the tasty graham crackers and sweet chocolate. It's actually not been long since he last ate S'mores but the gifted ones does tastes more like the nights of peaceful camping in the woods underneath the stars.   
  It calms him, he is very grateful of the gift. Whoever Tip is really didn't have to do all this but he is happy he has a friend that cares, even if it the way they reached out was startling. He ate the rest of the S'mores happily.

  
  He went to his bed so that he can sleep more comfortably. Maybe this time he'll have a new dream again. If not then maybe he could face the nightmares head on. It's best to sleep as tomorrow is going to be another day. He'll be needing a lot of energy for tomorrow's work and finding who ever Tip truly is. He falls asleep, waiting for the dream to come and the sun to rise.

I finally tried writing and finished a story. Hooray!

Btw his cake day is August 20 in my time zone and I did just realized it was his cake day late at night so I just continued writing this today instead. My own birthday is actually in August 31 so it's near too. Not sure if I'll do something for it but sure I'll try to think of what to do for this subreddit.

Logical Conclusions

“You're certain it's the same ship?” Oltuck quietly demanded. Alnure just gave a mild grin. 

“Yes Director, *I'm* certain. The station’s V.I. is certain. The sensor techs are certain. The drone maintenance members are certain, and even the signal operators are certain. It's the same ship, not a… *‘new’* build.” The smaller Drakken woman said. Oltuck looked at the holograms. The ship that crashed and the one jumping around the system. He looked back and forth between the two spinning images, and shook his head. 

“You're certain?” He asked again. Alnure snorted with humor. 

“Yes. We're certain.” She whispered. The red iridescent Drakken looked back at the two holograms again in disbelief. He was mostly wondering what they had done to the poor thing. 

The original, as battle damaged as it was, had still held the beautiful grace and charm to it. Sleek and deadly. The humans had clearly taken one of their primitive and brutalist submersible ships and made a space ship using the forebearer engine. 

While Oltuck doubted the power of the Forebearers, evidence of their existence wasn't debated. They did in fact exist. But the amount of physical evidence was… not great. The issue was that objects from the Forebearers were almost all space borne. There was almost no evidence of them having lived on planets. The obvious glaring issue with that assessment was that, if they had lived long enough ago, anything that was built on a planet was long gone due to natural processes. 

And so any unknown derelict ship floating around in empty space was inevitably claimed as a Forebearers ship, even if it wasn't.

However, there was a small handful of partials and pieces of Forebearer ships that had been positively identified as belonging to the enigmatic species. But it was a very small amount.

One of the big things that always frustrated researchers was that Forebearer ships also tended not to be fully intact. Space may be empty but float around in it for long enough and that *‘empty’* starts to feel very crowded. 

Almost all potential Forebearer ships had some sign of battle damage and almost always the ship’s power plant and engine were all destroyed. Sometimes that destruction looked like what killed the ship. Sometimes it looked like a stray asteroid had taken the ship’s systems. And yet even partial Forebearer ships were considered a valuable find. A salvage crew might never need to work for the rest of their lives if they even found the cockpit of one. 

The ship that fell into earth's ocean had been almost completely intact. In fact the only battle damage on it was very clearly on the front and top of the ship. Whoever had been flying her when she was taken out had done so charging their attackers. Oltuck spared a moment to think of the brave honored soul who looked their death in the face. 

Had the research team properly identified it when it was falling they might have been able to retrieve it before the humans got there. 

Had it been reported to the Drakken oligarchy it might have declared it a stellar emergency and a full scale invasion to retrieve the ship might have been launched. 

Okay, maybe that was a little much. But at minimum a strike team would have been sent to retrieve it from wherever the humans had been keeping it.

“Why wasn't it retrieved? The oligarchy would have approved a retrieval mission surely.” Oltuck asked. Alnure looked at him and smiled. 

“Sixty years ago, who was in charge of the oligarchy?” The black scaled female asked. Oltuck thought about it for a moment counting back the past six Council leaders…

“Ohzarin.” He said, realizing. 

Ohzarin. The Drakken leader who was both a supporter of non-interference and a patron of Sciences. He'd poured billions of his own credits into research and development of, well, everything. 

“Yes.” Alnure said with a grim smile. Taking her data slate and bringing up a picture of two messages. The first was a long detailed report about the event and the research team's recommendations on potential retrieval. The second was a very simple note that read, *‘Leave it. Let's see what happens. -Ohzarin’.*

“And later leaders didn't override this?” Oltuck asked exasperated. 

“That assumes later leaders even knew.” Alnure said. “This entire facility and her sister station are top secret already. Only a handful of oligarchy leaders have ever known this place even exists. And this event is even more so. ‘*I’* wasn't informed about it until the humans started FTL jumping around their system.” she said. Oltuck took in a deep breath. Then exhaled.

“What have the humans been doing when they jump around?” he asked.

“Unknown for certain but we believe it's been for basic research purposes as they have mostly been jumping to other planets in their system, from what we can gather they are testing their systems, seeing what the ship’s actual limits are, even testing some of their weapons in space.” Alnure answered. The bigger male Drakken nodded in understanding. Then he spoke.

“I am going to require your help and access to all the research material that this station has on the humans. It's time I start doing some reading.”

Lieutenant Jeremy Lock stood in the observation room looking into the brightly lit interrogation cell through the one way mirror. The kid - he couldn't help but call the man that, with how young he looked - sat in a chair at the metal table. The kid looked terrified, but not panicked. Something that Lieutenant Lock found to be a good sign. 

The kid wore dark blue jeans and a dark grey hoody with an olive green t-shirt underneath. He had black hair cut short with some length on top, a strong nose, and a sharp jawline. It was the kid’s eyes however that were the first thing someone noticed about him, a bright blue - almost grey- and somehow seemed to glow. 

The door to the observation room swung open and Lieutenant Avery Jenkins walked through in her dress blues uniform, she held a coffee cup in each hand and she stepped to stand next to Lock. 

“Four cream five sugar.” she said, disgusted, handing him one of the coffees. He took it with a smile. 

“Thanks.” he said, taking a sip of the bitter sweetness. Looking at it for a second before he smiled.

“Don’t know why you'd ruin perfectly good coffee like that.” Jenkins said, taking a sip of her own coffee that was the same color as the operation that the two naval officers were part of. 

Black. 

“Because someone has to make sure that sugar stays on the Navy's procurement budget.” he said with a chuckle. Jenkins simply snorted in response, taking another sip. She looked at the young man in the interrogation room. 

“Damn, he's hot.” she said casually. Lock gave her a glance with a smirk and a raised eyebrow. Jenkins was the poster child for a female officer. At least in looks. Light brown hair, slender athletic body and a face that would look good on a recruitment poster.  

“You talking about the coffee or our detainee?” he asked with a low chuckle. Jenkins shrugged. 

“Depends, off the record, he looks exactly like my type.” she said with a smile. “On the record I was merely making a comment about my coffee.” she said and the two shared a chuckle, and both took a sip of their drinks.

“Have you heard about how they retrieved him?” Jenkins asked, motioning towards the kid in the interrogation room. 

“No.” Lock said with a furrowed brow and questioning in his voice. The other Lieutenant snorted with derision.

“Apparently someone along the line didn't get the memo that it was supposed to be a quiet snatch and grab.” Jenkins said, breathing in with a sigh. Lock gave a hum that was filled with annoyance, frustration and disbelief.

“Yeah,” Jenkins continued. “Five SEALS kicked down the door of an apartment thinking they were going to be capturing some terrorist cell leader.” Jenkins said with pursed lips. 

“Oh.” Lock said with actual surprise. 

“Thank god the SEAL team lead had his head on. Otherwise this could have been really bad.” Jenkins said, taking another sip of her coffee. 

“Gonna be a show to figure out who fucked that one up.” Lock said with a humorless grunt. Jenkins snorted and shook her head with disbelief.

Their attention was grabbed by the door of the interrogation room being opened and an Ensign in summer whites stepped into the room with a folder in hand and his service hat in the other. 

The heavily muffled sound from the room was echoed by a speaker in the observation room. The two Lieutenants watched quietly as the Ensign pulled the other chair out and sat down across from the detainee. 

There was a length of silence in the interrogation room as the Ensign opened the folder and looked through the papers inside, the tension in the room growing with every second the silence stretched on. 

Then finally he closed the folder, set it down, and leaned forward with his arms crossed on the table.

“So, Mr….” the Ensign started, paused, casually lifting the corner of the folder to look at the paper inside. 

“Percival Lynch.” the Ensign said dramatically as he looked back up at the young man.

“Perseus.” The kid said. The Ensign stopped, clearly thrown off by the response.

“What?” the young officer asked.

“My name is Perseus, not Percival.” he said and the interrogator stared at him blankly.

“Percival is a knight of the round table, Perseus slayed Medusa.” the kid shrugged. The Ensign gave a slow single nod and then looked back at the folder.

“Mr. Percy Lynch. Do you know why you're here?” the Ensign asked, trying to take back control of the situation. 

On the other side of the mirror, Lieutenant Jenkins was trying to suppress a giggle.

“That isn't actually his name is it?” She managed to ask, still desperately trying to get a hold of herself. Lock smirked.

“Did you not read his file? That is indeed his legal name.” Lock said with his own chuckle. 

“I started, then I got caught up on his dossier of work and got a little distracted.” Jenkins said, still grinning broadly but with her giggling under control. Lock hummed a teasing understanding.

“He has a way with words doesn't he?” the male Lieutenant said with a knowing grin. Jenkins was about to respond when the door to the interrogation room opened. Both Lieutenants turned and looked before snapping to attention with a salute.

“As you were.” The man who had stepped through the door said. He had a shiny stainless steel mug in one hand as he walked in.

“Captain?” Lock’s voice was filled with curiosity that asked multiple questions. 

Captain Herald Maddock was a tall, broad shouldered man with regulation cut dark hair and eyes the same color. He and Lock could have been brothers with how similar the two men looked, with Lock having only a couple of inches of height on the captain.   

“Wanted to come get a measure of the newest *'unnecessary liability’* asset.” Maddock said, his words quoting something that neither Lieutenant was privy to, as he turned to look into the interrogation room. A small smile was playing at the corner of his lips. 

“Ah,” Jenkins said uncertainly. “Well the interrogation has really only just started so you haven’t missed much.” the woman said with a professional air that sounded cold. Maddock nodded approval taking a sip from his mug.

“Perfect.” he said with a smile. The three stood in silence listening to the interrogation continue. 

The questions from the Ensign were benign, meant to establish a baseline understanding of the person being interrogated. It was very text book and mildly boring. A few minutes of this passed with the young man seemingly not committing to a solid answer on anything. Then the interrogator asked a question that wasn't just mundane probing. 

“Tell me, Percy, you seem to be a man who likes to tell stories.” the Ensign stated. Percy gave a slow nod. 

“You do any writing?” the Ensign asked, the folder open in front of him but held in his hands in a manner so that Percy couldn't see its contents. 

“Yeah.” The young man looked at the Ensign with a sudden intensity, and it was clear that he understood this wasn't just a random question.

“Have you ever written anything in the military science fiction genre?” the Ensign asked casually as if he hadn't noticed the sudden intense stare.  

“Only once.” Percy said, his tone neutral. The interrogator seemed to freeze at that. 

“Oops.” Jenkins smiled quietly. 

“Interesting.” the Ensign said, trying to recover. “What was it about?” he said, clearly avoiding eye contact with the young man. Percy didn’t speak for several heart beats. And then said something so quietly that if it hadn't been for the sound enhancement microphones in the room the trio in the observation room might have missed it. 

“I was right.” Percy said, almost under his breath, a big smile slowly creeping across his face. The Ensign, either not having heard or still trying to maintain control, did not react. 

“Holy fuck I was right?!” Percy said loud enough to be heard by the interrogator. “You fuckers actually did find something at Shag Harbour!?” Percy said loudly, almost coming out of his seat in excitement. 

“And that's your cue.” the Captain said with  a calm smile. “Go give that poor junior officer some support.” Maddock said with a nod. 

“Yes sir.” Lieutenant Jenkins said with a salute before briskly walking off. As the door to the observation room closed behind the woman, Captain Maddock turned to Lieutenant Lock.

“Does she hate me or is that just her normal attitude?” Maddock asked. 

“No captain, she's just attracted to authority figures.” Lock said, taking a sip of his coffee.

“Oh.” the Captain said, watching as Jenkins entered the interrogation room. There were several heart beats before Maddock spoke.

“Unresolved issues or just a personal thing?” Maddock asked.

“Personal thing sir. No underlying issues.” Lock said. The captain merely nodded. 

“Well, the Admiral is gonna want to be the one to play tour guide. So I should probably go and ensure that he gets to.” Maddock said awkwardly. “Have a good day.”

“You as well sir.” Lock said, smiling to himself. Jenkins was gonna kill him for the rumor that he'd just started. But also, she'd only put four sugars in his coffee.

\------

“Hello.” Captain Maddock said, holding out his hand to shake. The young man looked at it for a half second as if the concept of shaking hands was a foreign idea before taking it. The young man had a firm handshake that had confidence that Maddock could feel. 

“Do you prefer Percy or Percival?” Maddock asked. The captain saw the expression of mischief flash across Lieutenant Jenkins face just before the young man spoke.

“I prefer Percy, but my full name isn’t Percival, it's Perseus.” the young man said with an awkward smile. Maddock only looked at him with confusion.

“Percival was a knight of the round table. Perseus killed Medusa.” Percy said. The captain nodded with raised eyebrows and for a second he wondered about…. A lot of things, now that he was thinking on such matters.

He gave the young man a nod.

“Percy then.” Maddock said. “Welcome, I’m Captain Herald Maddock. I think me and you are going to be getting to know each other very well soon enough, so if you would-” Maddock abruptly stopped mid sentence as he felt the buzz of his phone at his hip. He grabbed it, looking at the screen with a mild irritation, then sighed.

“Never mind.” the Captain said, then looked at Jenkins. 

“Unfortunately I have to take care of a certain matter. If you could, the Admiral would like a word with our friend here.” Maddock said, giving the Lieutenant a nod. Jenkins gave a crisp salute.

“Aye sir, I will escort the asset to the Admiral’s office sir.” she said with perfect navy inflection. Maddock nodded.

“Make it so.” The captain said with a humorous grin as he shook his head.

“Gods I love this job.” He said as he walked away.

\------

Percy followed the woman down the hallway of the building, his eyes scanning bare walls with supporting struts every twenty feet with a door between. Despite the lack of any form of decor, the building didn’t feel empty. Perhaps due to the narrow hallways, perhaps due to the general noise that could be heard from doors. Coloured lines that seemed baked into the linoleum on the floor gave a hint to how expansive this place must have been.

Percy wasn’t exactly sure why he was here. He had a few ideas, thoughts, and wild ass guesses. But none that he considered logical. Nor ones that he thought were probable. Each new idea making him go through the events that brought him here. 

He was a ‘*writer*’. He preferred the title as opposed to ‘*author*’. Not because he had anything against the title, but because he considered authors as more in line with traditional publishing. None of the stories he had written had ever been put to print. No, he was part of that new age of writing, posting it online on forums and his personal blog. Because of this he did not consider himself famous. He didn't even really make money from the stories themselves. He had people give him donations, but nowhere near enough to make a living off of writing. 

In fact the most attention he'd ever gotten for one of his stories was when he’d dipped his toes into the sci-fi genre. That had gotten good traction, but for every comment he'd gotten about how someone loved the story, he’d gotten another that told him that his understanding of science was at the level of a toddler.  

Those had stung. He'd done a lot of research and he knew that what he had written wasn't entirely accurate but he'd tried. And while he knew he shouldn't take what people say on the internet too seriously, to be told something he'd spent so much time writing was stupid had been demoralizing. 

Now it seemed that particular story might have landed him in hot water. Yesterday morning, he had woken up prepared to relax and do some writing. It was his day off from his day job and he knew that he could probably get another chapter in an ongoing series done. 

Then his door had been kicked in. Yelling. A lot of yelling. Guns pointed in his face. Hands grabbing him and then zip ties around his wrists. They’d even thrown a bag over his face for good measure. 

The experience had been an odd one to say the absolute very least. While he’d been terrified through the whole ordeal, his biggest worry as they'd thrown him into the back of a van hadn't been what was going on or what they were going to do with him, but how he was going to explain to the building manager that the door frame to his apartment being broken wasn’t his fault. He’d been thrown onto a plane at one point, which he was kind of miffed about as his first time ever flying had been with his hands zip tied behind his back. Not even a window seat. It was after the plane landed that he’d finally been given some water and something to eat. He was pretty sure he'd fallen asleep a couple of times. The only reason he knew that it’d been more than twenty four hours was because he had overheard some of the military personnel talking about it. But, through the whole thing, the thing that had actually caused the most panic and anxiety was the fact that he wasn't sure what had happened to his apartment. 

He didn't live in the best neighborhood, but he also lived on the fourth floor of an apartment complex that took some effort to get to. So he was only mildly worried about theft. Would he get charged for the door frame, and possibly the door, being broken? Would the building manager think he’d been arrested or kidnapped? The answer to that would determine how long he could be away before his unit went back onto the market. 

He had been hoping to get some answers but hadn't found the appropriate moment to ask about it.

The woman, Lieutenant Jenkins, walking in front of him stopped suddenly and he almost ran into her. They had stopped at a door near the end of the hallway. The door was clearly a reinforced metal door with a faux wood panel over top and looked like any other door they had passed with the one exception that a bright blue line on the floor stopped in front of it.

Jenkins knocked and then entered without waiting. Beyond the door, as Percy followed, was what looked like a waiting room for a doctor's office. Complete with a mildly annoyed looking woman sitting behind a desk typing rapidly on a keyboard. 

She wore a similar uniform to Jenkins and the two gave each other a nod. 

“We’re here at the request of the Admiral.” Jenkins said with a smile. The other woman didn't smile back but looked at Jenkins then at Percy. Nodded, and she picked up an old grey corded phone, pressed one button and a moment later she spoke into it. 

“Your expected guest is here.” Pause. “Aye sir.” she placed the phone back down and motioned to the door behind the desk. Jenkins nodded and followed the directions. 

The door was much like the others, but had on it a black metal plaque with a brass frame. The name engraved and filled in white read ‘Admiral Arthur Ebbner’.

They walked through and Percy looked around the room. One wall was dominated by a framed American flag. It hadn't been the first indication he’d gotten that he wasn't in his native country of Canada, but it was the first flag he'd seen that had confirmed it fully. The opposite wall was dominated by a large window with the blinds drawn. In front of Percy was a large desk with a man behind it who stood with a stern but friendly smile on his mustached face. Jenkins halted with machine precision and gave a salute that could only be described as professional.

The man behind the desk returned it and then spoke in a baritone voice that radiated authority. 

“At ease Lieutenant.” he said and turned to Percy.

“Hello, you must be Percy Lynch. I am Admiral Arthur Ebbner.” the Admiral said.

The best way to describe Admiral Ebbner was with the word square. The man had a square head and he was built like someone had put clothing on a brick. Even the thick pushbroom mustache and bushy eyebrows were essentially just rectangles of thick hair on his face. And he was tall. He looked like he was somewhere in the height of six foot eight. And Percy was looking up at the man as the Admiral held his hand out to shake. Percy, uncertain, extended his and watched as his own hand kind of just disappeared in the bigger man's grasp.

Letting go the Admiral motioned with the same hand to a chair that was in front of the desk. Percy nodded and sat down. 

“Thank you Lieutenant, you're dismissed.” the Admiral said. Jenkins saluted and did an about face before leaving the room closing the door behind her. Once the door was closed the Admiral sat down and looked at Percy with his friendly smile.   

“You probably have a lot of questions. But I think you already have the answer to a lot of them.” the Admiral said. Percy pursed his lips and gave a non-committal shrug. Ebbner only chuckled. 

“I would love to hear what you think is going on.” the Admiral said, leaning back in his chair. Percy worked his jaw in uncertainty.

“Well,” he started. “I think it's about a story I wrote, like what, two years ago? About how an alien space ship crashed into Shag Harbour, and how humanity used it to unlock space travel to the rest of the galaxy.” Percy said. The Admiral nodded, smiled, and motioned for Percy to continue. 

“I’m guessing I hit it right on the nose and you guys are wondering how I know, and who my source is?” Percy said. The Admiral laughed. 

“Oh no, boy we are beyond that point.” Ebbner chuckled. “When you first posted that story our system flagged it. And we had people watching you for the last two years.” The Admiral raised a hand to stop any protests. 

“It quickly became apparent that you didn't know anything but some in the project weren't convinced.” he said as if it was an apology.

“After the initial scare that our operation had been compromised, after we realized that you didn't know anything we thought perhaps this was a ‘Daily Telegraph Alarm’. You ever heard of that one?” the Admiral asked. Percy nodded.

“If you mean the D-day one from the second world war, where all the code names for the beaches and even the operation names appeared in a newspaper crossword before the invasion, then yeah.” Percy said, and Ebbner gave a nod. 

“I figured you'd heard of that. Based on your writing it seems like the thing you'd know about.” the Admiral said. Percy felt his face turn red.

“You’ve … uh, you've read my work?” Percy stammered out. The big man nodded. 

“Actually I quite enjoy your work. I had my granddaughters help me make an account for the forum you post on so I could follow you.” the Admiral smiled. Percy felt his face heat up and he looked uncomfortable and awkward.

“However, that's not why you're here. Or at least not the whole reason.” the Admiral stood from his chair and came around to the front of the desk and leaned against it as he crossed his arms.

“You see, Percy, you didn't just get the part about Shag Harbour right. You got so many other things correct that your story ended up on the desk of the director of Central Intelligence. It was so bad that we actually thought we had a leak at the highest level of government.” the Admiral said. 

“I couldn't have gotten that much right. I made up some names.” Percy said with a nervous anxious smile. The Admiral laughed.

“That you did indeed.” his laugh faded to a broad smile. “But some of those names were dead on, and you know what really freaked us out? It was the speech given by the character you had as the Director of Navy Operations, to the Secretary of Defense and the President.” the Admiral said with a conspiratorial smile. Percy paled as he thought back to the story he'd written years ago trying to remember exactly what he’d typed up, but he knew the scene. He’d only written one scene that matched. 

The Admiral stood and walked over to the window blinds. 

“It’s almost word for word the actual real life argument made. To be clear, in reality it was a letter but it is still very chilling to think how close you actually were. Quote ‘*We have spent decades trying to figure out how it functions. We've collected all the data we can, with every sensor, tool, and prod we have. We have no idea exactly how it works. We know how to power it on, and even how to use it. But not how to recreate it. Our technology is not yet at the point where we could do such a thing. As of now we have two options. We can put it in storage and let the scientists play with it every time we come up with a new tool to scan it with or, as proposed, we could use it and go see if we can find and ask the manufacturer themselves’*.” the Admiral said, pulling on the cord for the blinds. They went up with a swoosh and the window appeared. Percy stood his eyes growing wide as he saw the massive ship sitting in the covered dry dock.

“Holy fuck.” Percy whispered. The ship looked like a submarine, a long cylinder with rounded ends, and a classic dorsal sail. And that's where the similarities ended. It was white like the space shuttle, it looked like it might have been painted but he had no idea and it had two ‘wings’ near the back where the stern panels would have been. And where the antenna and periscope would have been sticking out on the sail there was a bulbous shape that looked like tinted glass.

“SVBN-001” the Admiral said with pride as he stood next to Percy. “Shes been on a couple of shake down cruises, ten in total. We visited each of the planets, Pluto included. And one that went out of system just beyond the gravitational pull of the sun. We’re preparing for her first true voyage out of the system to explore. She leaves in one week.” the big man said with a sigh of satisfaction. 

Percy was trying to wrap his head around the reality of the situation and he was finding it hard. He was trying desperately to figure out if this was some elaborate joke or trick but he couldn't find any obvious deception. 

His mind kept coming back to a very important question.

“So why am I here?” Percy asked, tearing his eyes away from the window and looking at the Admiral. The big man smiled.

“I’m certain you've already come to some logical conclusions.” Ebbner said with a smile. Percy pursed his lips and his eyebrows rose on his face. The Admiral’s grin grew wider. 

“We want to offer you a spot on the crew as a situation advisor.” Ebbner said with a cocked head. “You wanna go to space?” the Admiral smirked.

Percy’s eyes narrowed looking at him. 

“That didn’t answer my question. Why me? Me specifically? Why?” Percy asked, suspicious. Admiral Ebbner chuckled.

“You got me. You weren't the first choice. We actually had a different man who was slated for the position, he was actually here for almost a year. Unfortunately he broke his femur about four days ago and the Operation director didn't look too hard at who I had shortlisted to take his place.” He said. Percy stared at the Admiral in disbelief. 

“What in god’s name is wrong with you?” the younger man hissed wide eyed. “I’m not military. I’m not even a scientist, hell man, I don’t even have a degree, I dropped outta fuckin’ college man.” Percy said almost panicked. The Admiral only smiled at him.

“I had you short listed, and many of the people involved agree with me that you are actually, despite what you might think, a very good choice for this mission.” The Admiral said grinning.

“Your people are fucking yes men if that’s the case, what in god’s name would make them think a civilian was a good choice?” Percy mocked, wide eyed and slightly terrified.

“Because you took a wild guess and it was right. We analyzed your body of work and you want to know what every one of our experts say?” Ebbner asked. Percy inhaled deeply with nervous energy.

“All of them say that you have the most realistic outlook on situations. There are things that they are certain you would have had to do detailed research on and if you didn't that your guesses are so accurate as to be downright incredible. Your breadth of work is varied and on so many different topics that you have shown you have a wide pool of knowledge.” the Admiral said confidently with a wide mustached grin.

“My writing is fiction! This is real! And all my stories are-” Percy breathed deeply, cutting himself off before he started yelling and then exhaled, trying desperately to calm himself. The Admiral simply stood there with a raised eyebrow waiting for the young man to continue. When Percy spoke again his voice was back to nearly a whisper. 

“I work part time at a toy store when I'm not working at the burger joint for god's sake. I can’t afford to just disappear for … however long.” he said waving at the ship on the other side of the window. 

“Four months.” the Admiral said.

“Four months. I can't afford to disappear for four months.” Percy said emphatically.

“You won't need to worry about that. The US navy will be taking you on as a paid contracted advisor.” Ebbner said. 

“And my family? I only call them once in a blue moon but they're gonna wonder where I am.” the younger man said.

“You have a week. You can contact them and let them know that you won't be reachable for the next four months.” the big man said with a smile.

“What happens if I die on this thing, or pick up a space plague that turns me into a squid for the rest of my miserable life?"" Percy asked, trying desperately to keep control of his emotions.

“Your family will be informed that you died while aiding the US government in its time of need and that the circumstances of such are classified.” the older man said. 

“I’m not even American.” Percy wanted to shout but kept it as a hiss. 

“Technically this is a limited NATO project, we did dredge this thing up off your country's coast after all. Your government actually knows about this project. The reason it's a US Navy ship is because we're footing the bill. Your government also approved of us picking you up.” the Admiral said this time his smile faltering. 

“WHAT!?” Percy did yell this time stepping towards the Admiral. He immediately stopped, took a step back and breathed in deeply, holding it for a few seconds and then exhaling. He did this several times before he spoke again.

“What happens if I say no?” Percy asked.

“To you? Nothing.” the Admiral said. “We let you go.” The big man waved a hand dismissively. “Oh, we’ll make you sign a non-disclosure agreement and you won't be able to talk about what you know and will be monitored until the day you die or until this is made public, whichever comes first.” the big man said with a smile.

“And if I decide to go public and ignore the NDA? What happens? Assassination? Prison? Smear campaign?” Percy asked, looking up at the big man. The Admiral raised an eyebrow and smirked.

“A young man with no connection to the US government, starts telling everyone that the US has an interstellar ship and that ‘He's seen it’. Pull the other card.” Ebbner said.

“Point.” Percy said, looking back to the ship. There was silence for a moment as Percy shook his head still in disbelief.

“What's her name?” Percy asked calmly as if he was asking for the time, and he could hear the smile in the Admiral's voice.

“Prometheus.” The big man said. Percy looked over to him. 

“When was that name chosen?” Percy asked, not liking the smirk on the Admiral's face.

“Five years ago.” Ebbner said with a grin. 

Percy sighed with resignation. 

“You guys didn't name it after some senator or a state?” Percy asked. The big man shook his head.

“There was a lot of debate. The kind where people jump across tables to try and strangle the other person kind of debates. At the end of the day however, it was decided that humanity's first FTL ship was too important to name it after a person or place.” Ebbner said. “It needed to mean something, to have a name that would be looked at and thought fondly of.” The admiral sighed in satisfaction. Then looked at Percy. 

“What was your reason for naming her that in your story?” the big man asked. 

“The song ‘Fire in the Sky' by Kristoph Klover. It's the first word in the song. I was looking for songs about space as inspiration and just stumbled upon it. And the name, thematically speaking, fit really well, especially with how they… or I guess ‘*we’* came into possession of it, so…” The young man shrugged. 

“Huh.” was Ebbner’s only response. They stood there looking at the ship for a quiet moment.

“So, do you want the position?” The Admiral asked. Percy let out a sigh that quickly turned into a giggling laugh. 

“Hell yeah! Are you kidding me!? I wanted to fuckin’ go the moment you showed it to me!” Percy almost shouted the excitement and anxiety overwhelming him. His wide eyes weren't that of terror any more, but of absolute delight and readiness.

“Good. We only have a week, which unfortunately means that we have almost no time to get you fitted and ready. So unfortunately we won't be able to send you home to pack. Don’t worry, you will be issued some clothes. But we also have to take you through a crash course of training, and get you fitted out with gear. And while you've essentially been evaluated from a distance already, will have to do a psych eval as well. Any questions?” the Admiral asked with a large smile. Percy thought for a second, there was one last question he had but he thought there had to be something more important to ask. But he just couldn't get it out of his head.

“Yeah. About my apartment…”

Initially it ended ok, but it got messy after he came by to drop off the rest of my stuff after I moved out and found out the girl he told me not to worry about had moved in with him not even a month later. I was upset of course but I didn’t freak out on him but he totally shut me out and ignored the text I sent him a year later to let him know I was over any hard feelings and offered friendship. 

Well, fast forward to now, he sends me a long ass text saying he was sorry and hopes I’m doing well and will always have nothing but love for me. I was so happy to hear from him. I suggested we meet for a coffee or something and he agreed. I see him this weekend. 

I’m in a new relationship, happy and doing well. I’m strangely excited to see him. Like… I don’t know. It’s a lot of feelings. My current boyfriend said he is totally fine with it, and encourages me to see him and get whatever I need. I’m not really sure what exactly it is I need. I guess I’m just looking forward to knowing that massive chapter of my life doesn’t have to end on a sour note. 

Part of me is excited to just see him again. There’s no romantic feelings, he was my best friend for so long. It’s so weird. It makes me so happy to know he came around to being open to it. I really truly just feel so confused and excited and happy and sad all at once. 

My game plan is to go through all my old journals from when I was about to breakup with him to remind myself of what it was really like and not be looking back with rose colored glasses. Not that I’m worried about falling for him again, but to really be grounded in how far I have come and be ready to share with him how I really felt towards the end.

So, I’m in this weird headspace right now. I’ve been prepping for CAT like it’s my whole personality (RCs over coffee, DI sets in the middle of the night, QA haunting my dreams). But suddenly I caught myself thinking — what if I actually crack it? Then what?
 
I don’t mean in the sense of “oh yay, MBA life” but more like — is it really going to give me the clarity I think I’ll get? Or will I just be on a different kind of hamster wheel, still figuring out who I am and what I want?
 
At the same time, if I don’t make it, then what? Do I reattempt? Do I pivot to something else? Do I just keep trying random things until something sticks? It’s like either way, the future feels like fog.
 
I know CAT is supposed to “open doors,” but right now it feels like I’m standing in a corridor with a million doors and no idea which one I even want to open.

I have probation for non-dui reckless driving in Georgia (yes this is \*very\* unusual and I got screwed)  - Being on probation I do have to stay drug free and get random drug tests -  I also live so far away from the county I was sentenced in that I have to pay $170 to get these tests done at testing facilities near me. This has been a huge issue as I was advised it'd only be $60-$70; and it's a giant financial hurdle on top of everything else. 

All my other tests (this is my 3rd) have been negative and totally kosher but I had to take this last test in the afternoon and the results are showing it's on cusp of being ""diluted"" (I was gravity 1.001 and cut off is 1.003) though my creatine was ""acceptable"" on the test notes. 

Everything else in range and negative. 

I already sent it in advising I'd eat the $170 again to retest if the officer needs me to - but I am freaking out I'm going to be in trouble and they'll place a warrant for my arrest as a violation - and I don't know what to do. I don't feel supported or safe in this.

 In the 60 days I've been on probation I've been switched to 5 different officers - all without warning or my knowledge and I only found out because I called the corporate office to try to talk to someone because I didn't know who to reach out to to send this test to. I think that pissed the office off but it's been difficult to get all my conditions put in and confirmed received (all are done within 50 days and I've had to submit them to 3 different officers with no answer). Not bashing the company or any of the officers in saying this, I know they are overwhelmed and busy. It's a big reason why I just want to get through this without any issue. I don't want to be a problem and I want to get through this so I can move on with my life.  

 I don't do drugs which is clear, I have no intention of drinking until this is all over - so I'm not trying to cheat the system. This isn't me trying to hide anything - I'm just so anxious I'm going to be in trouble for no reason again (like this anxiety is BAD, it's not normal and now I can't afford a therapist) -  I'm panicking over drinking too much water or the large coffee I had before my test (no I didn't have any electrolyte or vitamins that day, I don't normally need them but I'm gonna take them moving forward, if I'm not thrown in jail forever) - I feel so stupid because in a normal world, being hydrated and drinking water is suppose to be a good thing.

I was given some steroids to manage it temporarily while we did more testing. I have an endo appointment on Mon (thank god) but had a follow up today with my pcp. As we were going over things she asked if my meds had changed at all in any way, including shape. They did in fact change shape!
