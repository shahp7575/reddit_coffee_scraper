I’m really stuck between the df54 and df64 (gen2). 

From what I’ve gathered, many say that the df54’s grind quality is the same as the more expensive df64. The df64 is just faster, upgradable, and larger. 

Personally, I like the fact that the df54 is smaller and takes up less room. I also like that it’s quieter since sometimes I like to make coffee at night and I live with roommates. I also really do not mind waiting on the grinder to run a bit longer.

I’m just concerned that the df54 won’t produce the same grind results as the df64, so I want to hear people’s opinions. The df64 seems to be the “go to” grinder now for most people, but if there isn’t a significant increase in grind quality, I’m not sure I can justify spending the extra $200 at the moment. The upgradable burrs are also a plus, but many seem to think that feature will be coming to the df54 soon as well.

1jjn1lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1jjn1lh/parents_pressuring_me_to_reconsider_awful_rishta/,Parents pressuring me to reconsider awful rishta,"I (28F) have been in the arranged marriage process since Nov 2023, and until recently, my parents were open and understanding. They’ve supported my career choices, never forced me into marriage, and respected my opinions. But one particular rishta (proposal) has turned everything upside down.

# Meeting the Guy – A Disaster

I met this guy in Nov 2024. Initially, I wasn’t keen, so I kept away, but my parents insisted I at least meet him. So I did. And it was awful.

* He sat facing away from me the entire time, barely making eye contact.
* Personality-wise, we are polar opposites. He’s into his business, doesn’t eat out, doesn’t travel. Meanwhile, I love my personal time, budget traveling, and hanging out with friends.
* When I asked about his social life, he said he only meets his school friends, which was endearing. But since he studied engineering in a metro city and later prepped for UPSC in Delhi, I asked if he made friends there. He said he had a roommate in college, but that’s about it and lost contact since he didn’t *“socially drink.”* I didn’t push further, but I was upfront that I regularly meet school friends, ex-colleagues, and others.
* When I asked if he drinks (out of curiosity, no judgment), he got offended, saying, *“I don’t even drink tea or coffee, how can you ask me that?”* I apologized because I was nervous, but the reaction itself felt extreme.
* He also asked how decision-making works in a nuclear family. I openly shared that my parents value my opinions and involve me in decisions. When I asked how it worked in his family, he just laughed mockingly and said, ‘We’re a happy family.’ It was so confusing and vague.

# The Whole Meeting Was Just… Off

He didn’t say a single word to my parents, which is weird because my parents are super friendly and treat first meetings as casual chats. It was too awkward. Afterward, both sides said no. I felt relieved and moved on.

* His mother didn’t eat anything, citing a fast (which in our culture is kinda an indirect rejection).
* His father was decent and level-headed man, he even enquired how I go about freelancing, how do I make it work, how do I price and invoice. I really appreciated such questions and interests.
* The guy himself was tactful but distant, saying, *“it's up to you what you want to do but one non-negotiable is he will never move or let his partner move away from their base for work or any purpose”* I appreciated his honesty and though ""oh well it's clear mismatch""
* His family was constantly checking things about us, which felt condescending.
* Later, the guy also asked very condescendingly if our house was rented (if it was, we'd tell), but they have been background checking us all the time, so it felt very deliberate **(In aftermath made me question whether my dad unknowingly gave off an insecure vibe as despite knowing this he wants to give a second chance).**

# But Now, After 5 Months… My Parents Are Losing It

Fast forward to now (March 2025), the guy's father has re-approached enquiring if we are still interested, and my dad got our horoscopes matched again, and apparently, we have 30.5/36 matches. Suddenly, it’s like that awkward, belittling meeting never happened, and my dad is emotionally blackmailing me to reconsider. It's shocking and disappointing at the same time, as my father and I always had sound dialogue, always finding a middle ground. But this time, none of my reasons matter.

He keeps saying:

* *“You should forget the first impression and give them another chance.”*
* *“You won’t get a better match.”*
* *“I’ve been looking daily, but there are no good grooms.”* (not true)
* *“You’ll never have to work or struggle if you marry into this family.”* (which is ironic, because my parents always supported my career and made their own)
* *“You have to compromise in any marriage, be it arranged or love.”*

I get compromise. But why compromise on fundamental compatibility? Moving to a town with zero job opportunities, where my lifestyle doesn’t fit at all, isn’t *adjusting*—it’s suffocating.

# Now My Dad is “Done With Me” (Apparently)

Today, in frustration, he threw the **classic dad line**: *“Fine, I’ll stop looking for grooms for you!”* expecting me to beg him to continue. Instead, I just said, *“Okay.”* And now he’s sulking ( I am shook by my calmness too, usually I get emotional). But, I am grappling with how one prospect can make me disappoint them this royally?

Reddit, how do I handle this? Personally, I want to escape home, get an in-office job and go the out of sight, out of mind way. But, I am open to any constructive advice here.

TLDR: My parents were open-minded, but now they’re caught up in astrology + a prospect who re-approached after 5 months. Leading to a lot of emotional pressure and unreasonable negotiation. How do I navigate this? Anyone else dealt with this?",1,1742918979.0,Arrangedmarriage,1,1.0,False

Here's the Mail Organizer Hack You Need!,"Ever feel like your kitchen counter is drowning in letters, flyers, and junk mail? You’re not alone. An average American household receives over 848 pieces of junk mail a year—that’s about 16 per week! It’s no wonder bills, postcards, and coupons pile up faster than you can say, “Where’d I put my keys?”

The good news? A clutter-free counter isn’t a pipe dream. With the best mail organizer system and a few easy-to-follow tips, you can banish that paper mountain forever. Below are seven practical ways to keep your mail in check so you can finally reclaim your space.

# 1. Sort Immediately (The “Divide and Conquer” Rule)

* Make It a Habit: As soon as the mail comes in, sort it. Don’t let envelopes linger unopened and unfiled.
* Easy Categories: Create simple labels like “Bills,” “Invitations,” “To Shred,” and “Review Later.”
* Speed Counts: The longer mail sits untouched, the more likely it becomes a chaotic pile.

Why It Works: Quick sorting prevents avalanche-style buildups. It’s a small daily habit that leads to major clutter wins.

# 2. Be Ruthless with Junk Mail

* Trash It Fast: Credit card offers, random flyers—if you don’t need it, it goes out immediately.
* Keep a Shredder Handy: Sensitive documents like pre-approved loans or financial statements can go straight into the shredder, removing any privacy worries.
* Opt Out: Reduce your junk mail by unsubscribing from unwanted lists. Fewer flyers mean less to sort through.

Pro Tip: Keep a small recycling bin or shredder next to your preferred sorting spot. That way, junk never has a chance to pile up.

# 3. Pick the Right Organizer for Your Budget

No two homes are alike—nor are two budgets. Whether you’re a bargain hunter or want a premium feel, here are three top-rated favorites:

(a) Budget: Pag Desktop Mail Organizer (\~$10–$12)

✔ Durable & Compact: Metal mesh frame with waterproof coating.

✔ 12 Compartments: Perfect for sorting bills, letters, and random papers.

✔ Great for Small Spaces: Sits neatly on desks or counters.

📌 *Best for: Basic organization on a budget.*

(b) Mid-Range: Amazon Basics 3-Tier Metal Document Organizer (\~$20–$25)

✔ Stackable Trays: Perfect for sorting urgent vs. non-urgent mail.

✔ Space-Saving Design: Keeps counters clear and mail visible.

✔ Sturdy & Dependable: Made of metal mesh for long-term use.

📌 *Best for: Households with frequent incoming mail.*

(c) Premium: Safco Mesh Desk Organizer with File Drawer (\~$40–$50)

✔ All-in-One Organizer: Multiple compartments + a drawer for extra storage.

✔ Heavy-Duty Build: Handles large stacks without bending.

✔ Professional Look: Works great in home offices.

📌 *Best for: People who want* *ultimate* *organization.*

How to Choose: Factor in how much mail you typically handle. If it’s a ton, that extra drawer in the Safco organizer might be your best friend.

# 4. Get Vertical with a Wall-Mounted Organizer

* Save Counter Space: If you’re short on surface area, a mail organizer for the wall keeps envelopes neatly at eye level.
* Multiple Compartments: Separate bills, invitations, and coupons instantly.
* Bonus Hooks: Some wall organizers include hooks for keys—talk about a clutter-busting double win!

Why It Works: By hanging your system on the wall, you’ll never forget to file or check your mail as soon as you walk in.

# 5. Schedule “Mail Time”

* Consistency is Key: Whether it’s first thing in the morning or right before bed, set a daily or weekly “mail hour.”
* Treat It Like a Routine: Just like brushing your teeth—quick, habitual, and non-negotiable.
* Faster Decisions: Knowing you have a dedicated time slot makes you less likely to procrastinate.

Life Hack: Pair your mail-sorting routine with an existing habit—like brewing your morning coffee or winding down after dinner.

# 6. Use the “Urgent vs. Non-Urgent” Trick

* Separate Immediately: If a letter needs action ASAP (like a bill due in a few days), file it where you can’t miss it.
* Non-Urgent Pile: A separate tray or folder can hold items that can wait—magazines, newsletters, or event invites with no immediate deadline.
* Stay on Track: You’ll stop missing important deadlines (or rummaging through piles at 11 PM).

Pro Tip: Combine this with your organizer of choice so urgent mail is always top-of-stack.

# 7. Maintain & Revisit

* Weekly Refresh: Set aside 10–15 minutes to clear out your organizer. Shred or recycle old mail that’s out of date.
* Monthly Deep Clean: Remove everything from your organizer. File away or toss what you don’t need anymore.
* Stay Flexible: If you find yourself hoarding coupons you never use or letting non-urgent mail pile up, tweak your categories or routines.

End Goal: A mail system that works automatically for you, so the paper never gets out of hand again.

# Final Thoughts

A cluttered counter or desk full of mail doesn’t have to be your reality. By pairing a best mail organizer system (like a desktop tray, wall-mounted rack, or multi-drawer mesh unit) With simple habits—immediate sorting, regular maintenance, and ruthless decluttering—you’ll keep your counters free and your stress levels low.

It’s time to let those 848 pieces of junk mail know who’s boss. Pick your organizer, set your routine, and watch the paper piles disappear for good. Because you deserve a home that’s organized, calm, and 100% yours.

I'm a developer and recently built a lightweight web tool to format, validate, and convert JSON into TypeScript, Python, Java, or C# models. I made it because I was tired of all the online tools filled with ads, popups, and trackers.

I added a small \[Buy Me a Coffee\] link on the site, mostly out of curiosity. To my surprise, a few coffees came in within the first few days.

I'm hosting a scam awareness panel for artists at a local convention.   

The panel is primarily for artists that sell niche items, fan art, keychains, plushies, coffee cups, prints etc.  Most of these artists sell both online and in person, so I'm breaking scams down into those two categories, online and in person.     

When naming scams if you are replying please leave out the exclamation point so the automod does not go crazy.   

For online, I'm covering  Artist or NFT,  Advance fee, and Fake check.  

For in person scams... I'm having trouble thinking of anything.   

Theft is a problem at conventions, but really artists are aware, and that's not really a scam.   Im looking for unexpected things like Fake check.  I actually know a lot of artists and getting scammed at a convention seems to be really rare in person.   I think its because things like fan art does not have a high resale value, and you are at risk of getting caught if you are there in person, so high risk, low profit, but any feedback especially about in person scams would be really appreciated.

What worries me more is when it looks clear (or at least seems to), because I’m not sure if it’s safe to drink. It often has a faint smell of chlorine or some other chemical, and when I boil it in the kettle, it leaves behind the residue you can see in the photo.
So my question is: is Cork’s tap water actually safe to drink?",5,1742918369.0,cork,1,1.0,False

Slow morning and breakfast
Our favorite song is on repeat
Slowly moving backwards
Coffee spilled, I'm on my knees

Feverdreams of what was
Slightly mad, I'm gonna be
Falling for a soft heart
In my arms, you're meant to see

Touching skin and leaving scars

Silent, standing in the fog

I’ve tried veggies that don’t have strong flavors - like cauliflower or pumpkin purée (which yes technically fruit, but nutritionally more like a veggie so I’m counting it lol). But these + fruits are still drowning out the coffee flavor. 

Alternatively, I’m cool with it tasting like peanut butter instead 😅

I'm a 37 AuDHD woman from Spain (so excuse me if i make a mistake with my English!)

Got my ADHD diagnosis January 2024, and Autism last summer, (there are also a lot of probabilities of having high capacities, haven't been tested yet but i'm... 95% sure of it). I'm still... trying to understand, to accept all that comes with it. I'm grieving.

I'm also going through a Big Burnout right now, this month has been a nightmare, exhausted, depressed, bad thoughts... ALL of it. Everyday.

... The thing is that i'm starting to think that ADHD meds (i take Elvanse, so stimulants) are only making things worse, my autism is taking all aspects of my life (for the worse), and i can't control my emotions at all.

At first meds were like wow, is this what people feel like normally? active, focused, even hopeful?! And the best part was my binge eating disappeared and food noise too, that's been so liberating omg i could cry...
BUT meds last 3/4 hours in my system and then big CRASH 💥 aaaaand the day is ended, i need bed time and silence and i start with the bad thoughts, crying... lots of despair and sadness. 
I've tried several dosis, taking half in the morning and half in the aftern but here i am. Things have gotten so bad, and i scared.

context: i am so sensitive to any stimulant, coffee makes me so anxious 

So my question is:

• as an AuDHD person, if you take meds (stimulants) for your ADHD, have you noticed your autistic traits controlling your life?

- what's your experience with ADHD meds and is it worthy???

I really need some advice or read your experiences, cause idk anymore. I'm pretty lost and feel hopeless.

For context, I am not a Drip employee. I am close to the staff and know very well of what goes on behind the scenes. 

For the past three weeks, a couple of the staff has reported having checks bounce due to the owner (Akera Sellers) having insufficient funds in his holdings account. This has caused employees earnings to be delayed by several days or just having to be paid through cash app or zelle. 

Along with that, Akera as of Tuesday March 25th, 2025, has cancelled the employees healthcare and dental benefits. They already do not receive scheduled breaks, pto, or vacation time. To make matters worse they have been working without air conditioning for 4 weeks. The employees have expressed to me that they “feel like they are working for free.” 

How is this the case when Drip makes over 1 million dollars in revenue annually? Most days are so busy at Drip that there is a line out the door and customers can’t find a place to sit. During days like this the staff cannot even make time sit down and eat a meal.

Drip is a staple in the Five Points community and acts as a third place for many of the regulars. The Baristas and kitchen staff work incredibly hard to keep the establishment afloat. Yet Akera does not seem to appreciate or respect the work they put in. There is so much more that needs to discussed concerning his poor management and total disregard for the staff’s well being.

I need help from the community to put some pressure on the owner and assist the staff in securing some proper benefits. If you love Drip as much as I do and would hate to see its downfall please provide any feedback, resources, or recommendations for protecting the employees!

I had, had a couple extra cups of coffees the day before (6-7 cups). I went for a walk because I was feeling uneasy and light headed and suddenly had palpitations, diziness and couldn’t continue so I decided to go to the hospital.

They did blood tests on me showing that I had dehydration and concluded that I was having anxeity. My close family friend is a doctor so I decided to live with him for a couple days. While over there, I went to my physician and she did another blood test everything was normal and said I could just be having a virus. 

The next couple weeks I kept having headaches and weakness. It had been around 3 weeks and the cold was gone but the headaches, in particular the diziness while walking and higher heart rate were still persistent. 

I went to the cardiologist he did an ultrasound and EKG and suggested that everything looks structurally alright. I was also told to go to the Neurologist, she did a neurological exam said everything was normal and suggested that I get an MRI done for the headaches and dizziness. 

Fast forward after the MRI, everything looks normal however I still don’t feel completely fine. There is a slight kind of pressure in my ears and I feel dizzy after walking and standing for long periods of time. This is also accompanied by higher heart rate while walking (150 bpm walking and near 100 when sitting) while lying down however the heart rate is much lower in the 70s and high 60s. 

I also went to the ENT to get my ears checked due to the pressure but it looked alright. When lying down I feel alright but when standing or walking for extended periods of time, even sitting for that matter feels really uncomfortable and dizzy. 

At this point I am very confused, it’s been over a month and I don’t feel normal. Very much like shit when walking or standing. My question to the people on this sub is HOW CAN I GET DIAGNOSED FOR POTS? I’m 100 percent sure my problem has something to do with circulation because after hearing my symptoms my ENT doctor suggested the same thing. 

This is causing me to become very anxious and the dizziness is just really getting in my way sometimes. I ask for your help and suggestions.  

I would like to get over this naturally if possible, walking a lot does trigger diziness and headaches, what exercises can I do, or foods that I can eat that have helped you deal with your problems? ",2,1742917538.0,POTS,4,0.67,False
1jjmg84,https://www.reddit.com/r/ICSE/comments/1jjmg84/opinion_icse_cant_effectively_have_competency/,Opinion: ICSE can't effectively have competency focused questions,"I'm not here to talk about the petition, the unfair exams, or any of the other topics that have been floating around since our exams finally ended yesterday. I'm here to discuss a deeper, more systemic question - *can ICSE actually execute the CFQ plan?*

My answer to this is, no, it can't. And I'm going to try to explain.

For years, ICSE and CBSE have been two competing boards, with both having different edges over each other. I've been in both, and my personal pick is ICSE - I feel that its strong English curriculum + segregated Science subjects leads to an in-depth understanding of the material. It's difficult, no doubt, but I also found it to be much more engaging and intellectually stimulating.

But neither ICSE and CBSE have strayed from their central ground - these are Indian boards geared for Indian futures. Both these boards have always had rote-learning galore, even though ICSE features it slightly less, in my opinion. They follow a similar model, which is what leads to the intense competition.

But not to go off on a tangent - my main point is that ICSE, despite all its arguments contrary to this, is a rote-learning system. Students memorize as much as they can of their textbooks for their exams - this has never been attempted to be changed. ICSE has always been shifty, at best, in acknowledging this, but if you ignore the larger entity and get into ICSE schools, you see that this is how students prepare, till today.

Now onto the concept of Competency Focused Questions. What do these even entail? As the name suggests, it aims to evaluate students' deeper understanding of the material, beyond the memorization. It aims to test critical thinking and analysis skills rather than memorization skills. And ICSE has decided to adopt them.

On the surface, it's all well and good and even seems like a step in the right direction for the Indian education system. But do you know what I think? I think it falls through.

You see, if you're incorporating these only 25%, or even 75% - you are not mitigating the fact that students are STILL mugging up their textbooks for their exam. Until that number reaches 100%, students still aim for ""50/60/70 toh mil hi jaayenge ratta maarke, baaki dekh lenge"". And they would be absolutely correct.

The truth is, the CFQs I saw this year were not based fully on competency. The student still had to mug up 5 different things and then analyze it and connect it to something else to come to the correct answer. That is not competency - that is increasing the difficulty level. That cannot be the way to approach a deeper understanding of the material.

What that does is create a threshold - only a student with interest and out-of-syllabi knowledge of a subject, especially in Science, is given the opportunity to answer these questions correctly. Competency is not meant to be more difficult, but more intellectual. I myself have looked at pages I didn't understand and instead of trying to understand them, I've memorized them and blurted them out onto the paper. That isn't supposed to fly under competency, but it does.

To give you the most basic understanding of what this truly means, it means that the student should be able to have the book open in front of them and still need some time to answer the question. It's based on connection and critical thinking, and true competency would allow the student to sacrifice the memorization for the same.

The truth is, no board runs from its rote learning the way ICSE does. It's almost afraid of how much it relies on the same, when it's actually *completely okay*. Being honest about benefits ICSE more - students know exactly what they're signing up for, therefore eliminating the students who come from CBSE to ICSE thinking it's some less expensive IB variant. It's not. It's a sharper CBSE variant and that's totally okay. CBSE sends kids for entrances - while ICSE does too, it's also perfectly equipped to start creating the next batch of intelligent children going to mid ranked Indian universities (by mid ranked, I don't mean average but rather the non STEM focused universities that are cropping up - destined to be below IITs but doing something entirely different). ICSE has the opportunity to open doors for its students, instead, it's out here raising the threshold for its exams making it less desirable to attend due to the increased difficulty level with no change in the system.

CFQs daalo ya nahi, bacche ratta hi maar rahe hai. You will not be able to change that with an abrupt change in the exam pattern which makes it more difficult rather than more analytical. The point of competency is to make it more equitable, instead, students who don't want to do that subject for the rest of their life are suffering.

Also - please stop with the story type questions under the pretense of CFQs. If it's not relevant to the question that the figure in your diagram is practicing for Olympics, don't add it. Don't add the figure also. Please don't put pictures of coffee in a question that is not gaining anything from the same. But this is just a pet peeve because I feel like they use these long, winding stories to just get to the same, direct, ratta-maaro question and then claim that they've done something different. If Vineet drinks coffee every morning, good for Vineet, but ultimately you're asking me for something straight out of my textbook.

In return, I have asked for a plan of what he imagines this year would look like to give me some peace of mind that we were heading in the right direction. Our therapist told us to just try to “head in the right direction” and eventually something will click. I do believe that but I run on the anxious side so in order to cope with the uncertainty, it would be really nice to have some things that are a little more “certain”. I’m open to what those are. Open to brainstorming with him; open to him brainstorming alone or with other people but I’d just like to see some activities other than just applying for every job under the sun. So for example, are there networking events he could attend, are there old coworkers he could have a (virtual) coffee with to catch up, are there courses he could take to target a certain job? I’m open but just tired of him trying the same things again and again, expecting different results in this job market. 

The suggestion of a plan was first proposed a couple months ago in a couples therapy session. Making a plan did not sound like something he wanted to do so the therapist recommended that we keep searching for something that felt more or less good to both of us. Nothing really came of that though perhaps due to how infrequent we meet with our therapist. It’s quite expensive. 

Yesterday I told him that I could really use a heart to heart and to his credit it went well and I felt heard. I explained that it would make me feel really good to see that he was trying different approaches. First it might actually work (no guarantees, would be great though) and secondly, it would give me peace of mind knowing that he is exhausting more of his options. So today I asked him if he had thought about what he might do and he has no answer for me. I acknowledge that I might not have given him enough time since we talked yesterday and I know my “request” is rather vague. But it’s intentionally vague. I don’t think it’s fair to dictate exactly how he switches up his approach, I would just be happy to see something different happen. 

He responded “no I haven’t thought about it” and it’s really starting to communicate to me how unseriously he takes my wishes. Without all the context, it might seem like I’m not giving him enough time but yesterday wasn’t the first time I’ve asked for that. I wasn’t expecting him to have overhauled his entire job hunting approach in a day, but I thought he might have had some initial thoughts and even if he didn’t, a response that acknowledged he didn’t get to it yet but intends to have more time to think about it later this week or whenever seems like a respectful response. Even a response that says he isn’t going to do it and explaining why would be welcomed as long as we could have a conversation about it. 

I’m trying to determine if I’m being unfair or unreasonable? I’m scared about our livelihood. He was the main breadwinner and while we are making things work, his unemployment can’t last forever. Is my anxiety getting the best of me and I need to focus on my own self care and trust that he will figure something out? Or is my anxiety trying to tell me or us something such as “do something different” or he cares about you until you ask him to do something he doesn’t want to do and then with no discussion or no consideration, he just does whatever he pleases. If it’s the latter and he is disregarding me, then it feels existential like I should ask myself if this is the relationship I want to be in. He takes care of a decent amount of things around the house and does plenty of the childcare for our son so I don’t have complaints about that but help?

Last night, my mom gets a phone call from my grandma saying that she's very sick.

Right after dinner, she started having bad stomach cramps, thew up a few times, and was feeling feverish and shaky.

She apparently complained about the pain being upper and to the right which lead my mom to think it's her gallbladder, and told her she needs to go to the hospital.

My uncle was supposed to take her, but let me tell you, both him and my grandma are totally dysfunctional. Anytime something like this happens where someone needs to get help, it's a huge problem.

My uncle usually throws a fit for one reason or another and refuses to take anyone anywhere, and my grandma does the same thing too.

Just as an example, about 2 years before my grandpa died, he was doing some yard work, fell, and broke his arm.

He needed to go to the hospital, but neither my grandma or uncle would take him because my grandma was ""polishing the tables"", and my uncle simply just refused.

So with a broken arm, my grandpa drove himself to the hospital...

So now you know what we're dealing with here.

My grandma called my mom today, and she's still sick, so she wanted my mom to take her to the hospital.

My grandma thinks it's food poisoning, but I don't think food poisoning would have you throwing up for 15 hours straight.

So now my mom is exposed to this.

I asked my mom to be careful and wear a mask, but she gets offended when you ask her to do so.

So I know she's not taking any safety precautions, and took a coffee and snacks with her, so she's going to be eating and drinking around my grandma while she throws up...

I don't know what's going on as of now, for all I know it could be her gallbladder, but I honestly think it's noro.

My grandma went out to eat on Saturday, and my uncle didn't. He's fine, and she's still in the incubation period for it.

To me the symptoms sound like noro, so for now, I'm treating it as such.

If it is, I know my mom is going to get it, and bring it here, and spread it everywhere like she always does.

Focused on myself, doing better now, but still a little hung up on my ex. Tried Hinge briefly but found no good matches. Don’t get hit on as much now due to a hectic master’s schedule and spending most of my time with friends/family. I have some questions at the end—-


Posting from this throwaway account since my main is quite famous 😬 can’t really post on any other sub with such low karma. I know this isn’t the right sub to ask for some CONCRETE advice but I’m giving it a shot since this sub 
knows about the dating pool (of course).

I had a horrible break-up 2 years ago (together 1.5 years). Went no contact on and off (off being more than on) with him, since I was the dumpee and still in love with him. I couldn’t move on easily (still got some lingering feelings). I was of stern belief that I would never entertain or talk to any other guy until and unless I was over him (to prevent hurting myself and also others). But it isn’t happening and my friends think it’s because I haven’t put myself out there. I’m a decent woman, doing my masters (in arts) from a tier-1 city. Not much of a hardcore party person, live with a small loving family of 4. THIS IS NOT me bragging but - a LOT of guys used to have a crush on me from my undergrad days. They used to ask my friends if I was still committed. After some months when some of them got to know I was single again- I got hit on SO MUCH. After a point I got tired of guys trying to score me, clearly noticing how miserable I was. I had to be rude and I started shunning all the guys who were hitting on me back then. So much so I started doing the same with guys who would just hit on me at cafes or coffee shops or at friends’ birthday parties. I became unwelcoming and unapproachable. This was a year ago. Ever since I started focusing on myself and I’m doing MUCH better now. I am still a little hung up on my first love but I’m committed to not reach out and maintain this no contact.

I made an account on hinge 2 months ago. Of course, got matches but no one seemed to match my energy. I was disappointed and I deleted the app in just half a day. Also I should mention I don’t get hit on now AS MUCH as I did 2 years ago, mainly because my masters is hectic which gives me little time to go out and I mostly spend it with my friends or sister. So I don’t find it worth to attend clubs and parties late nights that I’d miss my lectures the following day or miss assignments. Of course I’ll make time for a significant other. I have also never been in a situationship. Just relationships. That too long term. (3 relationships spanning 1-1.5 years)

(OPEN TO ANSWERS FROM ANYONE, not just women but I’d love a woman’s opinion) I’m asking-

1. Should I give dating apps another shot? Because I keep seeing people on here saying they’re drained of dating apps the longer they stay there and have given up and all, so I’m confused.

2. How do I make NEW connections irl? I have tried going to cafes to study and socialise. I do also join friends in the events they go to but I get awkward being the only one who knows just one person there. 

3. Do you think I should stay away from dating apps for now since I haven’t COMPLETELY moved on? (My friends are of the other opinion since it’s been 2 years I had even touched another guy. According to them new memories with erase the old ones.)

Lifestyle change or mold?","Moved in July 2024, symptoms started december 2024. Found mold on a wall and above shower one month ago.

Mid December i decided to quit weed, a week later i decided to quit alcohol and caffeine too. Shortly after i noticed some unpleasant things. At first i thought they were just withdrawal symptoms, and i believed that was the entire issue, but now that it has stabilised and i feel 0 cravings, i am starting to suspect there might be more to it.

My therapist has brought up the possibility of me having ADHD and suggested to pursue further testing.

What i noticed since quitting:

* ⁠Lots of anxiety/panic attacks 
* ⁠Absolutely no motivation to keep up hobbies i had
* Zero motivation at work 
* ⁠Fatigue, apathy, tiredness 
* Lower (almost no) libido 
* ⁠Lost interest in socialising

All of this is very unusual for me. Sure, i’ve always had bad days, sometimes i’d be anxious or be a bit sad. But ever since quitting i feel much worse mentally. I used to go out on the weekends, take long car trips just because i wanted to take some photos, i loved going out to restaurants even if alone. But now i just don’t feel the need to do any of that. I go to work, go to the gym, rot at home, go to bed. And repeat. I even lost any desire to play videogames, which is something i liked to do from time to time. 

This is extremely unusual for me, and i am looking on ways to “boost” my dopamine or at least bring it up a bit, because i feel like i’m just existing through the days waiting for motivation to come back.

Known deficiencies: 

* ⁠low Vitamin D: 14 ng/mL (ref range 30 - 100) •⁠low folates: 2.20 ng/ml (ref range >4.60)

Supplements:

* ⁠Vitamin D (4000 IU/day); Folic acid 5mg/day, High dose vit B complex (B1, B6, B12), Mag glycinate.

Edit to add: I quit in order to become healthier, not because i had problems regulating myself. I'd smoke weed in the evening before bed (3/4 puffs) and on sunday morning (a bit more). As for alcohol, i was drinking to the point of being drunk once per month, tipsy twice per month. With the occasional beer here and there.

As for coffee, i never went over two small espresso cups (30 ml) of coffe, so only abput 100mg of caffeine at most. i do not believe i am suffering withdrawals, i believe i am struggling with the absence of dopamine.

This is my attempt at living completely sober, and it's not going great.

Edit2: i exercise, i go to the gym and do cardio. I eat well and have lost 40lbs since November, so at least i know it’s not food induced",1,1742916887.0,ToxicMoldExposure,0,1.0,False

She ended up backing out that weekend bc she felt sick, so I gave her some space and we started talking again next week. I asked if she was free again, and she said yes but suggested bubble tea. I realized I should have done that in the first place. 

The date was almost a disaster in the beginning after I broke something in the kitchen, had to clean up the mess, showed up 30 minutes late bc I had to drive across state lines to another town, and my cards got declined at the parking meter. I was just so stressed and she could tell. 

Then I didn’t know what to get and picked the dumbest flavors ever (non-milk fruit tea with popping strawberry). She probably judged me hard for that 😂 

I also forgot to tell her I can cover the bill and when the cashier asked, she immediately said to separate the orders before I could open my mouth. She came in prepared and was not treating this like a date at all.

I knew my chances were over at that point and I couldn’t fully be myself. Our convo was surface-level and I didn’t ask deeper or more interesting questions and get to know her more. She was very nice and friendly during the convo, but it was nothing more than that. She gave me a hug at the end but she said she’ll let me know when I asked her if she was free next weekend.

She said she didn’t feel a connection the following week but it was a good learning experience. You can roast me all you want cause I have already beaten myself up more than you can imagine over these past few weeks so nothing you say will be new to me 😂 I wish I could go back and change everything but I cant do that.

Are there any movies that capture the feelings of initial excitement, realistic dates, when one person doesn’t feel a deeper connection, or rejection/breakups?

Please don’t mention movies where the guy harasses the girl constantly like Arya 😂

1jjm6gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1jjm6gn/today_my_siblings_are_being_removed/,"Today, my siblings are being removed.","After eighteen years, I was getting rid of the voices in my head.

In my reflection, a single bead of red ran from my nose. 

I swiped it away, forcing a smile. But I was pale. Shaking.

*“Mara.”* Levi’s voice was a breathy sigh. 

I swallowed a pill to control the nosebleeds, washing it down with lukewarm coffee. 

Suppressors tasted like puke. But they *did* stop my body rejecting me. 

*”Dude, stop drinking coffee! You know it gives you panic attacks.”*

I ignored him. “Don't go yet.”

I imagined him standing in a wooden doorway in my mind, smirking. 

He was so close to the edge, so close to letting go. 

Still, he slammed the door shut. 

*“Awww, Mara’s gonna miss us,”* he teased.

Serena’s giggle was barely a whisper, like ocean waves. 

*“Okay, but why are you even upset?”* Levi laughed. *“Aren't you *happy* to be getting rid of us?”*

He had a point. I *was* looking forward to having private thoughts. 

Jumping into the car with Mom, she shot me a look. 

“I know it's hard. But I promise, it'll be better when they're out.”

I flinched when she leaned close, wrapping her arms around me. 

“Hello, baby,” she murmured to my brother. “I trust you’re keeping your big sister in check?”

*“Always, Mom.""* Levi chuckled.  

Mom drove me to the severing bay. Halfway there, I felt him let go. 

Like an invisible ribbon had been cut. 

*”Relax, Mara,”* his voice more of a footprint. *”I'm resting my eyes.”*  

Outside the facility, I slammed into a boy, barefoot, hospital gown clinging to him. 

He froze, mouth opening and closing, before shoving past me. His eyes were so *blue*. I found myself… captivated. 

“Move!”

I opened my mouth, and his eyes turned feral. 

”Don't.”

He shoved past me, catapulting into a sprint. 

The doctor told me to lie on a steel bed, a masked woman hovering over me.

“How long have your siblings been hibernating, Mara?” she asked, prodding my skull.

I shivered under the cruel prick of her scalpel. “Eighteen years.”

“Mmhmmm, and have you been taking your suppressor?”

“Yes.”

She chuckled. “Ah, I can see them! They're so beautiful! Look at them! Lying directly on the surface of your vessel’s brain! What are their names?”

I smiled. “Levi and Serena.”

I was about to ask how long it would take when the words caught in my throat, a gurney rolled past. 

A boy was strapped down, his eyes open and vacant, staring into oblivion. 

It was the kid who had run into me. 

A pale blue bracelet was fastened around his wrist.

His body jerked. His eyes flickered, lips parting. I saw that mesmerizing blue once again. When he twisted his head, his gaze locked onto mine.

“Please,” he whispered. “Help… me.”

When I tensed up, the nurse hummed, poking in my skull.

I should’ve turned back an hour ago.

The road’s gone now. Just a whisper under the snow. My wipers gave up ten minutes back, frozen stiff and smearing white instead of clearing it. Headlights press against the flurry like fists in cotton, doing nothing.

I’m not even sure what lane I’m on.

Somewhere between Abergavenny and Brecon, on one of those B-roads that snakes between empty farmland and forest.

It’s been snowing since late afternoon. At first it was soft, flakes that vanished when they hit the windscreen. Now it’s thick, wind-driven—snow that sticks, that sinks, that swallows.

I pull over because I can’t see anymore. Because the steering wheel’s vibrating from ice. Because if I go even ten feet farther, I might not come back.

I kill the engine. The world doesn’t go quiet—it goes muffled.

••

It’s only when the heater dies that I realise how deep the cold is.

The silence inside the car is weird. Artificial. The kind that makes you hyper-aware of yourself. The way your jeans crinkle when you shift. The tick of the dashboard settling. Your own breath fogging the air.

I check my phone. 7% battery. No signal.

Figures.

I’m not scared yet. Just annoyed.

I pull the blanket from the back seat, wrap it over my legs. Crack open the thermos. Lukewarm coffee. It tastes like burnt pennies.

Somewhere in the trees to my left, a branch snaps.

I freeze.

Just wind. Has to be.

I tell myself that a few times.

Then I hear something else.

A low dragging noise, soft but deliberate.

Snow being disturbed.

I sit up. Peer through the fogged windscreen.

Nothing but white.

••

Ten minutes pass. Maybe twenty.

I try to ration the heat in my body. Gloves stay on. I pull my arms inside my coat and cross them over my chest.

The cold isn’t sharp—it’s creeping. A living thing, finding seams, working its way into joints, ears, ankles.

I distract myself. Think about dinner plans. The job I need to call back about.

Then I hear it again.

Crunch. Pause. Crunch.

Too slow for deer. Too heavy for fox.

It’s pacing.

Circling.

My hand slides toward the driver-side window. Wipes the condensation.

There—a shape.

Tall. Not moving.

Just a silhouette behind the snow.

I blink. It’s gone.

••

*“Right,”* I mutter. *“Right. Okay.”*

I start the car.

The engine stutters. Groans. Dies.

I try again. Nothing but a click.

The battery’s frozen or flooded.

I swear softly, fogging the inside of the windscreen even more.

Behind me, in the mirrors—nothing.

I shift in my seat.

Try the heater again. Nothing.

Now the silence is watching.

••

Half an hour later, my toes are numb.

The shape hasn’t come back.

But something taps the rear window.

Once.

Soft.

Like a knuckle testing glass.

I turn around fast enough to make my neck cramp.

Nothing.

But now I’m sweating under the blanket.

Something’s out there.

And it’s not going away.

••

I think about getting out.

Digging out.

Walking.

But where?

Even if I knew which direction the road went, I couldn’t see five feet. And if something is circling me, walking into the white would be like handing it a knife.

No.

I stay.

I breathe through my nose.

Try not to fog up the windows too much.

••

There’s a knock.

Driver side.

Three taps.

Rhythmic.

Like a question.

I flinch so hard the thermos spills on my leg.

I turn slowly, heart beating in my throat.

There’s a shape against the glass.

But it’s not a hand.

It’s longer. Jointed the wrong way.

Like an elbow that forgot how to be an elbow.

It drags downward, squealing faintly against the frozen window.

I don’t breathe.

It vanishes.

Then, from the passenger side—laughter.

Not loud. Not right.

Like someone trying to remember what laughter is supposed to sound like.

Too wet. Too slow.

I whisper: *“No. No, no, no—”*

The door handle clicks.

Once.

Twice.

Testing.

••

I lean across and lock it manually.

My fingers burn from the metal.

Then I hunch down behind the steering wheel, eyes barely over the dash.

Breathing shallow.

Then I see it.

Not the whole thing.

Just its feet.

Hooved.

But wrong. Bent too far back, like something stitched together from memory.

It’s standing directly in front of the car.

Facing me.

I close my eyes.

I count.

I listen.

When I open them again—it’s gone.

••

The snow presses harder against the car now.

The air’s like needles.

I wrap the blanket tighter, curl into myself, tuck my hands under my thighs.

Fingers tingling.

Teeth chattering.

I think of a fire. A pub. The smell of frying onions.

Then I hear my mother’s voice.

Outside.

Calling my name.

***“Sweetheart?”***

Soft. Sweet.

Wrong.

She’s been missing for three years.

I shake.

Not from the cold this time.

From the sound of her feet crunching toward the window.

••

My mother’s voice again.

“Sweetheart. Open the door.”

She sounds like she used to, when I was a boy and stayed too long outside. Warm. Patient.

But I’m thirty-six.

And she’s buried in Bexhill.

The snow hushes everything but her voice. It weaves in through the glass and stitches itself around my ribs.

***“Sweetheart, please. It’s cold.”***

I clamp my hands over my ears.

I whisper to myself. I repeat facts. ***“This is not real. I am in a car. I’m suffering mild hypothermia. Auditory hallucinations are common.”***

Then—tap, tap—on the passenger-side glass.

I dare a look.

There’s something standing there. Not her.

Tall. Covered in matted, wet fur that sticks to a torso too long, arms that hang low. Its head tilts like a crow listening for something in the soil. I see only the corner of its jaw—too wide, loose skin dragging over the bone.

And then it smiles.

Or tries to.

The cheeks pull upward, splitting at the corners like paper.

Behind the skin—teeth. Not rows. Layers.

I scream without sound. My breath fogs the glass.

The thing leans in.

And whispers in a voice not made for breath:

***“Let me in, Sweetheart.”***

••

I wake up with a jolt.

Daylight.

Pale, sickly, stretched thin over the horizon.

The snowstorm has slowed. Everything’s soft, still.

The car windows are glazed with frost, but nothing’s outside.

No tracks.

No marks.

No sign of anything.

My joints scream. My mouth tastes like blood. I must’ve bit my tongue in my sleep.

Sleep. God.

I slept.

With *that* out there.

I unlock the door slowly. Step out into the cold.

The snow is almost waist-deep, but soft now. Powder.

I wade around the car.

Nothing.

But then—there.

A single hoofprint behind the vehicle.

Pressed deep.

Almost burned in.

Like the snow melted around it before refreezing.

I stare at it for a long time.

I don’t breathe.

••

I make it to the nearest town just past midday.

I walk. Two and a half miles, I think.

I don’t remember most of it. Just flashes. Tree trunks like columns. Light spinning through branches.

A man at a petrol station stares as I stumble inside. He gives me tea. Calls someone.

When the police come, I tell them I got stuck. Slept in the car. Frostbite in my fingertips.

I do not mention the voice.

Or the smile.

Or the way it knew my name.

••

They found the car later.

They tell me there were scratch marks on all four doors.

They tell me the roof had been dented inward, like something heavy had lain on it all night.

They show me a photo of a trail leading away from the car.

A single line of footprints.

Then nothing.

As if it just… disappeared.

••

It’s been a week since this happened.

I haven’t left my flat.

I keep the curtains shut. The kettle full. The heating on.

Sometimes, at night, I think I hear the wind again.

Sometimes, I swear I see frost on the inside of the window.

And once—just once—I thought I heard her voice again.

Calling my name.

But the thing that terrifies me most?

I want to answer it.

I want to open the door.

Because I know…

Whatever it is,

***It’s not done with me.***

Not sure if this is the right sub but vaguely similar questions asked here before, and it isn't really legal or financial advice so not appropriate for the UK Legal Advice or UK Personal Finance subs.

I'll try to keep it short if I can!

Wife work in a nail salon in Manchester, ran by her family, mainly her aunt. I've been helping out with bits and bobs here and there, while trying to get my solo freelance photography business up and running. A hard slog, but I have confidence, some decent jobs coming in already, and plenty more people saying they'll have stuff for me when events get going more in the summer.

But today her aunt mentioned she wants to turn over part of the salon into a coffee shop. It's ideally located, in the Northern Quarter. It's nice too - homely and traditional, not like the bright pink monstrosities in the city that do a questionable job and have questionable employment practices...

It's also more than big enough - she rents the entire top floor of a two storey building and all the nail stuff can basically fit in one room. More than enough room to turn over at least two thirds of it into a coffee/boba tea type place. Opening such a shop is also my wife's dream gig. 

I've made clear I would consider being a partner in the idea, but do NOT have any money to invest in it. I'm also ""lucky"" in that I have nothing to lose in terms of money or my own house.

But I've no idea where to start.

No booze being served so no need for licencing, but surely even for coffee/boba tea and basic food items, you need a Level 2 in Food Hygiene training? I know you'd need a food hygiene rating but kind of have no choice as they just rock up and say ""yay or nay"" to whether you're doing things properly. I have extensive experience working in pubs, so I'm pretty knowledgable on these kinds of things anyway.

The main question is how likely these things are to fail. I see way way too many people going into a business idea full of beans and excitement, but then it fails after a year. It's not like Manchester is short of coffee shops. 

It's also a potential massive time drain which could impact on my main line of work. It sounds like I don't want to do it - I do, I'm just vary wary about the potential pitfalls. It would also be something largely run by staff, so it's not like I'd be serving coffee all day, but minimum wage is £25k a year, so even with my wife and one other worker on, that's £50k income needed just to break even. Sounds like a massive ask.

There were rumors being spread about me having an eating disorder at my last job (always started by an obese person)

What’s frustrating to me is that obese people can eat fast food and gorge themselves on snacks ALL day at work…and no one says anything or accuses them of disordered eating. 

I drink coffee or have some carrots /grapes for lunch and everyone is asking me if I “ate enough” and if I “ever eat”. So then I’m forced to eat larger amounts of food to appease a bunch of obese coworkers. When it’s none of their fucking business. I used to drink the fake “regular” soda bottle or Starbucks and say “there’s like 300 calories in this” to get them to leave me alone.

But there’s a third piece of the puzzle that doesn’t get nearly enough attention: **social health**.

So, what *is* social health, exactly?

At its core, social health is about how we build and maintain relationships — with friends, family, colleagues, and our wider communities. It’s our ability to connect, communicate, and feel a sense of belonging. And the truth is, it plays a huge role in our overall well-being.

# The Science-Backed Benefits of Social Connection

Humans are hardwired for connection. Research consistently shows that people with strong social ties live longer, recover faster from illness, and experience lower levels of stress and anxiety. On the flip side, chronic loneliness has been linked to everything from high blood pressure to depression.

In other words: healthy relationships *aren’t a luxury* — they’re a form of preventative health care.

# Signs Your Social Health Might Need Some Love

Just like we notice when our body feels off or our mental energy is low, there are signs that your social health might need attention:

* You feel isolated, even when you're around others
* It’s hard to open up or ask for support
* You’re withdrawing from social activities you used to enjoy
* You crave deeper connections but don’t know where to start

If any of that sounds familiar, you’re not alone — and the good news is that social health is something you can *strengthen*.

# How to Boost Your Social Health

Improving your social health isn’t about having a million friends or being the life of the party. It’s about nurturing relationships that are meaningful to you. Here are a few ways to start:

* **Check in with someone you care about** — even a short message can go a long way
* **Join a group or community** based on shared interests (online or offline)
* **Practice active listening** — being truly present in conversation builds deeper bonds
* **Set boundaries** where needed — social health also means protecting your energy
* **Be open to vulnerability** — real connection happens when we let ourselves be seen

# Social Health in a Digital World

Yes, tech can sometimes make us feel more disconnected. But when used mindfully, it can *enhance* our social health. Think: virtual game nights, group chats, support communities, or apps that remind you to reach out to people. The key is using tech to build connection — not replace it.

Social health is just as important as physical or mental health — and they’re all deeply connected. Investing in your relationships isn’t selfish or frivolous; it’s a powerful act of self-care.

So go ahead: make that call, send that text, plan that coffee. Your health depends on it.",1,1742916056.0,u_miamiironside,0,1.0,False
1jjluzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1jjluzt/im_so_mad_that_im_crying_again/,I'm so mad that I'm crying again,"2 of my husband's friends came by this weekend. And bil joined in to the fun. And they went on a boy's trip or whatever. Fine, idc, I can handle LO without issues.

What pisses me off so much is that they drank all day. All day. They drank and smoked so much that our car smells like shit. Like alcohol and cigarettes. And I'm supposed to put our LO in there?? And not only that. One of the friends puked in there and didn't clean up. And the entrance to our house (think, you open the door, there's a small space to leave your shoes, then open another door to get in the living room) smelled like piss for 2 days. 

And one of the friends got 🍃 and smoked it in a bar that they went to. While my husband is there. And left some of it in the car while they were in the bar. Wtf??? 

They didn't give a shit that our baby stays in the car. That they had ilegall stuff in it. That if someone in the bar would've called the police, my husband would've probably been arrested or idk (maybe I'm overthinking this, but I doubt the police would have ignored him). 

Anytime his friends come here, they get shit faced. I spent 2h cleaning the damn house while they were out. Only to make it dirty. How hard it is to clean after yourself?? If you spilled coffee, and there are 4 rugs right there, why tf don't you wipe it off??? 

Nobody lifted a finger Sunday. Nobody. The bil made himself food and didn't clean the pan he used. He put the dirty knife with the clean dishes. and when my younger brother was 6 y/o, he cleaned better then than BIL now. He gives me an attitude when I asked him what was he smoking in our back garden. 

Yeah, my husband was pissed too. He came home angry from all of this Saturday night. But like, isn't he enabling them?? 

I'm so sick of always having to keep the peace. Oh, don't say anything to them, let them be, don't make a scene. Before we had a baby and a mortgage? Yeah. I bit my tongue and was pissed and then it passed. But now? I bit my tongue and I'm so pissed I'm shaking. 

God forbid they come here again and I see a beer in their hands. Or if BIL comes by unnanouced again. I'm so done being a doormat. I'm so done of my efforts to be a good host being thrown out of the window. Why should they care if I clean and try to keep our car and house nice? I'm a sahm and my job is cleaning anyway 🙄

Venting all of my frustrations here so I don't explode when my husband comes back from work and asks me if I'm okay. I don't even know how to approach him. I'll figure it out. I'll calm down. but now, I feel like Homer Simpson when he's angry at Bart (if you catch my drift), except I'm angry at them. 

And I threw out the 🍃 because they didn't even make a good attempt to hide it. And I don't want that shit in my house. We live in a quiet, nice, full of old ladies, neighbourhood. And I plan to keep it nice and friendly.  (Idc what anyone does at their own house. Smoke whatever, I couldn't be arsed enough to care. As long as it doesn't involve me)

Lord give me patience, cuz if you give me strength, idk what I'll do.",2,1742916038.0,beyondthebump,3,1.0,False
1jjlux6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DadForAMinute/comments/1jjlux6/guy_advice_needed_please_he_wants_to_take_me_out/,"Guy advice needed please, he wants to take me out but said he is busy and will fit time in but idk if he is a red flag","So I need some advice because idk if my gut is telling me to not talk to this guy or if I am overthinking , it’s long! 

So I met this guy at this event thing and I knew I liked him but just acted normal because I didn’t want to get involved with anyone from the events but I liked his eyes but I acted normal but he then was giving me these eye signals that he clearly likes me too. 


Then one of the event days I was with him and these others at the after party, then me and him were leaving then he asked if I want to go somewhere for a drink or something then I said I want something to eat then he said we could go to a corner shop but I thought no way this is silly and it was nearly 3am then we saw two guys and a girl from the event waiting for taxis so I took it as a sign that I should go home too, 

he waited for my taxi to come but didn’t pay for it but I guess I didn’t know him well enough anyway but while we were walking down some stairs he put his hand out for me to hold while walking down the stairs which was either sweet or him just wanting to hold my hand for a min or both anyway while we were waiting I said I was cold and he gave me his coat which I did like. 


And the whole event he would give me this look lol. Anyway he walked me to the taxi but didn’t open the door and I like guys opening doors but anyway that was the second or 3rd time seeing him (in the events brief convos etc seeing him around). Also he was walking very close to me so like making it obvious he likes me. 

Then on the one of the last nights I left quickly to buy an iced coffee (just £1) but he walked with me so I don’t have to walk on my own that late because I asked and he asked if I wanted him to pay for it but I felt awk to say yes so I just said it’s okay, anyway later in the night we were all there then quite a few of us walked to a club where they had pizza too because it was the last after party, while we were all walking together me and him were talking and I asked him what type of woman he would want to be with, 

an independent woman or a dependant woman then he said independent and said that he would want her to have her own stuff going on in her life and ambitions etc but then I explained I meant like in the financial aspect if she had ambitions etc but wanted him to pay for everything and provide then I can’t remember word for word what he said because I think he was like well he wouldn’t mind paying but it’s nice when the girl does that every now and again which I said well I would on my mans birthday haha, anyway idk if I was just hearing what I wanted to hear. 


Anyway we seemed to agree a lot on that there is a lot of toxic feminism etc and a lot of women who date men and don’t let them be there for them etc or say that don’t need a man and put there man down etc But anyway I also did tell him a lot on why I like being in my feminine energy and that even when I see my cousins they carry my bags and everything. Anyway he then later on when we were dancing offered to carry my bag because I didn’t want to hold it or leave it on a table out of my sight. 

So when we were all at the bar he asked me what I wanted to drink then I asked the bar staff for a mocktail and before he paid he said to me ‘I swear if this mocktail ends up being £500’ he was joking but idk about men making jokes about not paying, 

anyway he paid then we sat down and he asked me to dance and we danced then he kept giving me those eyes again and I was kinda getting shy because I liked him and I also know that out of respect for myself I can’t let it go anywhere without him actually investing, he asked if he can kiss me and I said I am not one of those girls that just kiss guys without actual dating etc anyway later we went out for a few mins and while we were out he said sorry about coming on to me then I said it’s fine and was trying to explain that it is just because I want to actually be dating the guy first etc and he kept trying to interrupt me calmly saying that I do not need to explain why I don’t want to kiss, then I said to him that it isn’t that I don’t find him attractive etc but yeah. 

Anyway we went back in and he said to me that it probs wouldn’t work with us anyway because he drinks alcohol then I said to him that that isn’t what I care about too much but (and I should not have said this because I never make the first move but I only said it because he was showing me he liked me but I still shouldn’t have) I just said ‘well if you wanted to take me out for dinner then I wouldn’t say no’ then he said he will definitely take me out for dinner. 

Anyway we carried on dancing while he had my bag on him then the place was closing so we were waiting outside and it was raining and I said I was tired and wanted to sit down but not on the ground then he sat on the ground so that I could sit on his knees without getting myself dirty which I found so sweet, anyway he asked if I was going to book a taxi and I said yes but told him if we are going to start dating he will be the one paying for my taxis haha, 

anyway this other guy who was with us was saying he might see if his taxi can drop me off but then didn’t come back so he just said ‘you know what I am just going to book you a taxi’ then while he was booking it for me he said ‘did I tell you I was broke?’ Which I found weird because I don’t like men talking about money idk if he was just saying it, anyway then I tried to say it’s fine but he insisted, taxi said there was like 15 plus mins left to wait so we got up and went into a reception area building to sit down and wait. 


After a bit of talking because it was empty there he told me there are two cameras, one ahead of us and one behind me (which I found interesting how he looked around for cameras?) Anyway we were sat talking and I asked him what is the worst thing and best thing someone’s done to him and when he was saying the worst thing he was beating around the bush a lot saying a girl who was his best friends girlfriend accused him of stuff and I had to prod more for him to then say she accused him of being violent and trying things on with her (basically edging around her accusing him of some sort of sexual assault) and idk if he was telling the truth or not because a few guys have said that in the past and I can’t think of many women who would lie about that idk. 

Then he said to me ‘you don’t have to tell me what the worst thing someone has done to you is’ which was nice to hear because it didn’t feel like he was trying to get info from me But after I got him up to try to floor him then he started getting closer and trying to come closer to kissing me, he did kiss my neck for a second then moved but I didn’t let him kiss me but idk if I was giving him signals, he then said ‘stop resisting’ while coming close for a kiss but he didn’t actually force anything and we didn’t kiss but idk about someone saying that it sounds weird idk. And he didn’t text to see if I got home okay but it was on his uber anyway. 

The next day it was the last event day and I saw him, he was less handsy because he didn’t drink probs, anyway I asked if he was going to walk me to the bus stop and he walked me but then didn’t even wait for the bus to come or message me to see if I got home safe Idk if I am right to not talk to him again like if I am just having a big crush that I am not listening to my standards or gut

Sorry if it sounds weird i didnt want to post it but idk what to do because i feel torn because i don’t know if I am exaggerating and was just being an idiot sending mixed signals but i did tell him that i did not want to do anything 🤦‍♀️ 

I really shouldn’t date rn I need therapy because if this isn’t a great guy then its because my unhealed self is attracting that idk 😩 I feel stupid idk :/ ",0,1742916033.0,DadForAMinute,2,0.5,False

Which is an ordeal on its own but my girlfriend, Tasha, has very poor hygiene in that department. One would expect her to be perfect in EVERY way with her overall charismatic personality, but she kindaa smells reeeeallly bad down there. I love my girl and of course do as she tells me but the only reason I do is because after having a few good orgasms, she falls asleep looking up at me. We have sex every night before bed now that we've moved in together, and the relationship is going beautifully, as if we're married, but lately she's been taking advantage of my master skilled tounge work. Looking through her phone she tells her friends that I'm a ""guru of the cliTORis"". And that kind of upsets me, Ive never told any personal details like she does with her friends as I do mine, and I wonder if she wants her friends to be drawn to me because of the matter. I don't want to sound cocky but it's the truth. She also makes me seem like im obsessive with her and all that. I'm really not. Obviously I don't want her to cheat seeing I'm 10 years older it would be easy for her to find a better man. But the way she describes it as if I'm some sort of creep. That's not what I'm worried about though. I only go down on her because everytime I do, she falls asleep on my stomach with her head facing mine.
Usually if I ""forget to go downtown she crawls beside me to spoon or whatever. I've been going down on her EVERY night for weeks now, and it is torture on its own. But her hygiene is getting worse and worse every day. I make sure I clean her well afterwards and sneak cinnamon in her coffee as well as buying cranberry juice cocktail im hope she drinks it(she does), but even with all my shag attempts to de-oderize herself, it just gets worse. I don't know if I should try and fix the smell in secret, or otherwise just straight up tell her. I'm afraid she will get mad and gossip about me to her friends if I tell her but if I don't, I'm afraid I'll have to eat seafood broil for the rest of my life.

Ever since Brittany had gotten her wolf, Amelia spent every day urging her own wolf to resurface, yet nothing happened. She knew that no one would want to be with a wolfless girl, thus she continued meditating and praying for her wolf to show up.
As the evening came and the party was about to start, Amelia made her way to the venue. Blake was supposed to pick her up but he seemed to have forgotten.
Hye everyone.. Can anyone share link for this novel: The alpha's rejected mate by ideaink six cats. 
Worthless To Priceless: The Alpha’s Rejected Mate revolves around Amelia, a courageous she-wolf who finds the strength to change her life.
Amelia woke up at three in the morning to begin handling her daily chores. She had to clean the house and prepare breakfast before her father and her twin sister woke up. The girls were the Alpha’s daughters, yet the man only doted on the older sister, Brittany.
Today was a special day as the girls turned eighteen. When Alpha Gregory woke up, Amelia was happy and brought her father a cup of coffee, eagerly waiting for him to wish her happy birthday. The Alpha ignored her though, silently savoring his drink.
When Brittany came downstairs, Gregory’s demeanor changed, he became happy and wished his favorite daughter happy birthday while telling her about the birthday party he had arranged for her.
The two of them kept chatting while completely ignoring Amelia. The girl was broken hearted but at least she could count on Blake, her boyfriend. He was the sole person in the entire world who cared about her and the only one willing to defy everyone to be with her.

1jjlq0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PaulMielcarz/comments/1jjlq0y/the_great_depression_democrats_vs_republicans/,🪙 The Great Depression: Democrats vs. Republicans,"The Great Depression is often remembered as an economic tragedy. But more than that, it was a philosophical failure — of both parties.  

Republicans worshipped deregulation. Democrats worshipped intervention. Neither side understood the Logos.



 🧱 Context: 1920s America



The 1920s were a time of rapid economic expansion, led by Republican presidents who praised the free market — but misunderstood what freedom truly means.  

Banks were unregulated. Wall Street speculation ran wild. Debt fueled growth. No safety nets. No structural restraints.  

By 1929, the machine cracked. The crash came. The system imploded.



 ❌ Republican Errors: Deregulation as False Liberty



President Hoover refused to intervene. He believed the market would self-correct — that freedom meant letting people suffer.  

Tariffs were raised (Smoot-Hawley), triggering global retaliation. Bank runs wiped out savings.  

The core mistake was confusing deregulation with freedom.  



\- Deregulation is not freedom.  

\- It is the removal of essential constraints — and it leads to chaos.



This false liberty ultimately destabilized the system itself.



 🛠️ Democratic Response: Stabilization Without Growth



FDR stepped in with the New Deal. Jobs were created, banks were stabilized, trust was partially restored.  

Social Security, the SEC, the FDIC — these were not engines of wealth, but instruments of containment.



But FDR also:

\- Raised taxes on wealth

\- Expanded federal control over business

\- Empowered labor unions at the cost of business flexibility



He did not end the Depression. WWII did.  

Still, he prevented collapse, and protected the system from worse outcomes.



 ⚖️ Systemic Breakdown: Chaos vs. Control



\- Republicans pushed false liberty → economic chaos, asset bubbles, collapse  

\- Democrats pushed false empathy → command economy, tax overreach, stagnation  



Both sides deviated from Logos — one into anarchy, the other into soft totalitarianism.



 🧠 The Logos Lens



\- Free is right deed  

\- Will is right need  

\- Liberty is essential constraints



Freedom without structure is destruction.  

Empathy without boundaries is exploitation.  

Constraint without Logos is tyranny.



Real capitalism is not deregulated chaos.  

Real compassion is not parasitic dependency.  

Real liberty is built on essential constraints — designed for right action.



 ⚠️ The Deeper Danger Today



The modern Left, especially Democrats, have corrupted empathy into a weapon:



\- They feed masses of dependents — not to uplift them, but to enslave them, through controlled benefits and engineered dependency.

\- They cloak neo-feudalism in compassionate rhetoric, where parasites vote for their masters, and good people are drained of resources and freedom.



Dependency is not wrong in principle.  

But dependency engineered for control becomes soft slavery.



Meanwhile, modern Republicans push deregulation to the extreme:



\- They destroy stable legal structures, unleashing corporate predation

\- They glorify the market, while fueling bubbles, exploiting loopholes, and collapsing systems

\- Their fantasy of freedom results in economic Mordor, where power flows to the richest warlord



 🧭 The Real Future: Logos Governance



America does not need Soviet control.  

America does not need anarcho-capitalist hell.



It needs Logos.



\- Order with freedom.  

\- Constraint with justice.  

\- Empathy with responsibility.



The Great Depression showed what happens when neither party governs with wisdom.



Now, a century later, the stakes are even higher.

If there’s already a group, I’d love to join! If not, maybe we can start one? Let me know!",7,1742915442.0,frisco,1,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 That's changing soon, though. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Finally finished all the achievements. Paradox, I know you check this sub, and I have two requests for the next patch. First, please stop putting achievements that require you to play like you have no critical thinking, or where you just have to sit and do nothing for the majority of the time, it's very not fun.  Second, all JE for a country should be visible in the potential tab and greyed out. I shouldn't have to google how to trigger events that are crucial to achievements, or that make my enjoyment of a nation less complete. It's just not fun and feels like I am always missing some elements from a run. For example, the Donghak movement does not show up at all until you have satisfied some criteria. I should see the requirements to trigger this JE BEFORE it actually shows up, otherwise I wouldn't know how to trigger it.  This is one of the most frustrating thing I have had to deal with (war being the most frustrating aspect of the game).  

Also some of these achievement guides were very vague or misleading so here is are some tips for some of the trickier ones:

- Estado Novo:  Get rid of the monarchy. Pedro should not die, and you should try to lower Magnanimous Monarch to get the Republican Proposal. Try to have strong landowners, I had a rebellion, landowner clout crashed, just spammed a bunch of landowner generals to get them back up in clout. You have to have them have high clout while the river of coffee and cafe au lait are active. You should get the Populist Unrest JE https://imgur.com/a/klrB41B. Once you activate this one, PB will take over the country and you will get a different set of objectives. It doesn't matter who the ruler of the PB is but what you will need to do is get compulsory education, Interventionism and some other stuff. You can see here:https://imgur.com/a/4x4xni1.
Compete this for the achievement.


- Hermit Kingdom: you can industrialize if you want, but it's better to just spam agricultural buildings to get the clout of the rural folks up. The steps are simple but annoying: 
   *   Get out of isolationism.
 * Pass any laws that remove leverage resistance such as Free Trade and Protected Speech to try to get a country to get 200 leverage over you.  
 * Have > 20% radicals. 

The Donghak journal entry should pop out. Once that happens, keep radicals high still, until you get the Journal entry that requires you to pass back isolationism, and then you're done.

- Our Words are backed: First, you have to stay as UK subject. Second, do not research pan-nationalism until early 1900. The goal is to have the Indian national movement be active by 1910 to spawn Gandhi. If you research it earlier the movement will die away fairly quickly. If you find that pan-nationalism is nat spreading, just do a bunch of share knowledge with your subjects. Once Gandhi spawns it should be super straightforward to get him to be the rule of your nation.


Some difficult but not tricky achievements: 
- The Real Movement (just don't play well, do everything communists hate so that they can have support when you research the communism tech).
- American Territory: A lot of RNG, but just make sure to befriend the US to get some independence. 
- I'm the Captain Now: Join the Zollverein as Belgium or Sweden. Use France and GB and Russia to slowly whittle away at Prussia.
- Reading Campaign: small nation, closed border, social mobility on as many states as you can, level 5 public schools (or private if you have really rich pops).

I am reaching out in hopes I can get some advice or helps on my journey 

In Nov 2023 something clicked and I started hitting th gym. I weight 245 at the time. 1 year later I was at 175ish. 

Currently I am at around 168-173. 

I still have spots where I'd like to lose fat, not concerned about weight as I know that will fluctuate and not matter when lifting weights. 

My areas are stomach and chest. No matter that I do, nothing seems to lose anymore fat at all. My measurements are still the same as they where 6 months ago. And it's starting to get very discouraging. 

I eat about 1900-2200 cals a day. Typical meals are:

Just coffee in the morning with high protien milk
Brunch/lunch: yogurt, chai, psyllium, buckwheat, banana, granola = 600-700 cal
Snack/lunch: coffee with high protein milk and protein powder = 200 cal
Dinner: depends on what my wife and I make, so it varies but typically it's between 800-1200 cal

I'm not a super close watcher of the exact cals intake hence my variance of 1900-2200 a day. 

I work out Monday to Friday first thing in the morning.  typically about 1.5 hours of weights followed by 20-30 or cardio. Throguht the day I walk about 8-10km (12000-15000 steps). My estimated cal burn for a day is 2800-3400 a day. 

I know I am building muscle, I can see it, that's for sure. But I need help figuring out why I cannot lose anymore stomach fat or chest. I'm not looking for a perfect ripped body in anyways. I just want to lose another 2-5.lbs of fat in those areas or more inches (just using this as a measurement as again I know weight is not the end all be all). 

Stats of me:
170lbs
5'6""
39yoa
Caucasian
Work 9-5 desk job (hence the daily walks)

So I go to my daily coffee shop and there is a long line mostly full of spandex warriors (you know the guys on there bicycles with those stupid shoes) this coffee shop ALWAYS has a line, but it moves quick the baristas are super friendly their coffee is insanely good and our neighborhood loved them dearly. I guess these bikers aren’t from this neighborhood bc they are waiting in line and one goes “I’ve been waiting over 10 mins” first of all sir there’s literally almost 30 of you, you are the reason there is a line… one of his other loser buddies goes “let’s all give them a 1 star review to hurt them” mind you one of the baristas is sitting outside where the line is. They are a locally owned small business… I can just tell they are all tech vultures and it’s 7am and I have no tolerance for BS so I yell back “just leave if you don’t like the coffee shop, you’re the reason there is a line” and the barista goes “yeah seriously”. I said it again louder bc I wanted to make sure they heard. They did they just are the type who can’t own or confront any situation. I really don’t care, they were rude first. I really don’t appreciate people like this nor respect them. The city would be better with less of them.

Made a inquiry earlier at 1 am and realized it was a stupid time to post it and I was half awake about presenting a list of Bend companies registered with the far-right ""anti-woke"" company PublicSquare for people to make their informative decisions of whether or not they would like to give them their business and decided to go screw it and do it either way while also providing a link to the website if you would like to search yourselves. This is not me telling you what to do, but rather to make a decision for yourself if you want to do business there or not.

What is PublicSquare?   
PublicSquare is a MAGA backed, far-right and conservative company group that holds itself to be ""anti-woke"", anti-choice, conservative christian, and all the like in pushing forward ""American owned small businesses"" that fight ""the agenda"". This is a website that the companies themselves register to be placed on and backed, so think of it like a conservative green book on businesses whether they are vocal about it or keep it on the dl. Not every MAGA business will be on there given not everyone knows about it, but it does show those who definitely do.

1jjlebw,https://youtu.be/OOVKevOPQwg?si=LM9Cl-QOta_F1vuk,Laura Jane Grace announces new album,"Polyvinyl Record Co. and Laura Jane Grace are pleased to announce the Friday, July 18 release of Adventure Club from Laura Jane Grace In The Trauma Tropes, a new and incendiary, 12-song collection exploring the archetypical hero’s journey tropes from classic Greek mythology: love, war, trust, betrayal, virtue & vice, iced coffee drinks — it’s all there, and so is the fun! Featuring the help of Grace’s wife and collaborator Paris Campbell Grace (vocals) and Athens, Greece-based musicians Jacopo “Jack” Fokas (bass) and Orestis Lagadinos (drums), Adventure Club is the product of a month-long, life-changing trip and songwriting retreat in Greece that came by way of a Fellowship grant through the Onassis Foundation that provided Grace with the inspiration to create some of the best punk she’s ever made.

Like classic power-pop propelled by Oi!’s revolutionary oomph, Grace’s new single, “Mine Me Mine”, lambastes endless capitalist avarice, or how it is used to manufacture suffering for others.

“Pure evil” — Fox News

“The fiercest punk singer of our time.” — Rolling Stone

“The 50 Greatest Rock Lead Singers Of All Time” — Billboard

Additionally, Grace will be making numerous North American appearances this spring and summer with Murder By Death, Alex Lahey, PET NEEDS and Rodeo Boys in select markets starting next week. Tickets for all shows are on sale via Grace’s website. 

Before the phrase “Adventure Club” became the title of Laura Jane Grace’s electrifying new album, it was the name for her gaggle of adventurous friends in Greece. In the summer of 2024, Grace joined an artist residency program in Athens, embedding with Greek punk rockers and exploring the ancient landscape and the city’s vibrant culture. They dove from beaches nestled in seaside caves into the Aegean and swam with sea turtles. They submitted to tourism, seeing the Parthenon and Epidaurus and breaking into the Panathenaic Stadium to run its track. They became addicted to Freddo espresso, a locals-only iced coffee topped with whipped milk. The lifestyle of this “Adventure Club” inspired her so much that, by the time she left Greece, she’d unexpectedly finished Adventure Club, a new career apogee that recalibrates what punk rock means for her now.



Two years ago, the Onassis Foundation invited Grace to Greece. They wanted her to transform “Walls,” a century-old poem of isolation and doubt by Greece’s Constantine P. Cavafy, into a song for a short documentary about inmates learning to express themselves through film while in prison. When she traveled there in early 2024, the filmmaker assembled a pick-up band of local punk rockers (plus Paris) for a string of shows. When the brief tour was done, bad weather delayed her flight home. Waiting for her early-morning exit, she stayed up all night with the ad hoc group and Paris. They recorded a new version of “Walls,” then flew home in a delighted daze. When she returned six months later after earning a full residency with the Onassis Foundation, Grace co-wrote and cut an entire LP with Paris, bassist Jacopo Fokas, and drummer Orestis Lagadinos, that pickup group called The Trauma Tropes.



Adventure Club is frequently a record about learning to take up space, about feeling free to be yourself as the bullshit of our ahistoric moment mounts. Protest songs and personal tunes have never been a binary for Grace, and she delivers some of her most profound — and, yes, playful — work ever at that particular intersection here. But the most prominent thread through Adventure Club’s dozen tracks is one of evolution, of letting yourself become something new.



She talks often about her age, about nearing the second half of her 40s after a lifetime as a punk. What does it mean, really, to remain a punk for 44 years? For Grace, it is the same as it’s always been — a resolve to question everything about oneself and the world around you and to allow yourself to evolve within that framework. Adventure Club epitomizes that spirit the way that the best of Laura Jane Grace’s music always has.



The young punk from Florida may never have imagined making a record in Greece, but it does not change the spirit of the songs that inspired them: to create a place where we’re all burdened by less bullshit, whether it’s our own baggage or the stuff that autocrats, capitalists, and assholes simply want to put on us because they don’t know the thrill of being happy and free themselves. Maybe they need to try writing a rock song, or simply jump into the sea.

Laura Jane Grace will be making the following appearances this spring and summer with The Mississippi Medicals. Dates below.

And a fully organized closet after massively purging and making a place for everything that remains. I can finally ‘see’ the disorganized clutter. 

In fact when I went to the one small storage unit last night it didn’t look ‘small’ - it looked overwhelming and disorganized even though everything is in uniform clear plastic tubs. I quickly shut the storage closet door 😂. I don’t even wanna think about it until I get the rest of the apartment organized. 

From this personal experience, I truly now think clutter blindness really is the brain’s protection mechanism from overwhelming sensory overload. I was even able to smell some trash today. Quickly shut the bathroom door where 6 bags of trash are currently waiting for me to haul them out…will haul in a few hours. 

It’s a little scary and overwhelming to see how much still needs to be done. I decided to go to a coffee shop to decompress from the sudden shock. It’s even scarier thinking how much I had shut down for years…

Drawing on this new ‘sight’, I will start on a 7th trash bag - a small one but who knows it might grow into a full bag. There’s still excess aspirational stationary, as well as expired food. Gonna wipe down front hallway and move the three boxes of stuff to the guest bedroom and see what I can throw out. I’m confident I’ll find some trash. That will give me a clear front entrance!

Which I know isn't true because the time frame they initially tried to convince me he was cheating was he was in another state.  Also got accused of stealing my husband from someone he was supposedly dating here (and the drama that comes from that) when he and I have been a couple for about 9 years. 

Basically, I've have had to avoid making friends with anyone online,  in-person, and avoid talking with co-workers about anything personal in order to not have to deal with being drawn into immature drama either fueled by my ex or by some woman that lives here who I don't know that has the hots for my husband and is using her friends group trying to break us up.

I feel one with the flow of energy around me almost.. like i'm just about to figure something out, something i going to work out, something is right around the corner... any anxiety and fears and feeling of needing to escape i had with coffee are gone. Occasionally I feel an entity but rarely... it all feels right, so much more right than when i frequently drink coffee. Then i go back to drinking it and start again this cycle anew.

I’m thin, but in shape. 

I enjoy staying active, whether it's a hike with the dog or me trying to ice skate (going is easy, stopping not as much). I enjoy video games and binge-watching true crime documentaries. I always enjoy learning something new. I love to go to concerts, but my musical tastes haven’t evolved past 2005, I am afraid. I am always up for an adventure—whether it’s a spontaneous road trip or just hitting up a coffee spot. 

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s kind, caring, and doesn’t mind sharing a laugh. Intelligence and a good sense of humor go a long way with me. If you can keep up with both fun and silly chats and some deep conversation, we’ll get along just fine. Hopefully there will be plenty of flirting along the way.

My tips,"Pillows are great, snacks are comforting, but when you're full of 💩💩💩 it feels like NOTHING ELSE MATTERS! Narcotics cause constipation, and that first 💩 can be a doozy. Just check out the Opioids sub for some firsthand experience lol.


I'm 4DPO and finally got relief. Don't be like me. Here are my (maybe TMI) tips as a chronic constipation girlie:


- Start hydrating well BEFORE surgery. 


- **Have Miralax the night before**. It's a gentle osmotic that pulls more water into your intestines. You need that water to keep your 💩 from turning into a giant, hard sandpaper-covered 💩 from hell.


- **Taper off the narcotics** as quickly as you comfortably can


- **KEEP HYDRATING** 💦


- **Move around** to stimulate the bowels, gentle laps around the house are great. 



- **Warm liquids** like hot lemon water help stimulate the bowel, especially first thing in the morning.


- **Senna is a game changer.** I learned about it from my friend who relied on it during cancer treatment. Smooth Move tea is gentler than the pill form.


- **Don't strain!** Don't hold your breath while pushing, only push as much as you can while breathing out as if through a straw. Rocking back and forth or doing little circles on the toilet can help too. Be patient, you're doing the Lord's work 🙏🏼


- **That first 💩 might still be hard and dry thanks to the narcotics.** Your best bet will be a glycerin suppository. I know I know, sounds scary but they're so small and easy to use! It helps ""lube up"" the hard, narcotic-induced devil 💩 that's stuck in your rectum so it can come out. Wet the end first and bear down a bit when you insert it if you're scared (it relaxes your opening).



- **Elite combo**: Take a Glycerin suppository, wait 10 mins then chug a cup of black coffee with Miralax in it. This might be too much for most people but if you struggle with sluggish bowels like me, it's a life saver.


Good luck and happy pooping!",13,1742914107.0,Reduction,1,0.93,False
1jjl3ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1jjl3ma/doortodoor_knife_sharpening/,Door-to-Door Knife Sharpening,"Alright, let’s dive into why reviving a classic service is like taking a cherished old recipe and giving it a fresh twist, sprinkling in some modern tools and marketing magic. Imagine Grandma’s famous lasagna, but now it comes with gluten-free noodles, organic cheese, and an Instagram-ready presentation. That’s the essence of updating a classic service—keeping the heart of it while making it relevant to today’s crowd.

First off, let’s talk about those modern tools. There are more apps and platforms out there than I have socks in my drawer, and trust me, it's a lot. These tools can streamline service management and improve customer interactions. Think about using scheduling software that lets clients book appointments with just a few taps, or customer relationship management (CRM) systems that help you keep track of your interactions with clients. It’s like upgrading from a rotary phone to the latest smartphone—same purpose, but now it can do so much more. Efficient operations mean happier clients who get their needs met swiftly, turning them into loyal fans.

Now, let’s sprinkle some local digital marketing on top. Enter Facebook groups—your secret weapon for connecting with the community. These groups are like the neighborhood coffee shop but without the overpriced lattes. Engage with locals in a genuine way, share tips, and more importantly, showcase your revamped service. You could share encouraging stories, customer testimonials, or even fun behind-the-scenes peeks at your process—after all, who doesn’t love a good “meet the team” post? It’s about fostering relationships, not just making sales. People appreciate authenticity, and when they see the heart behind your service, they're much more likely to come knocking on your door (or clicking on that ‘book now’ button).

And then there’s the cherry on top—subscription maintenance plans. This idea is pure gold. Think of it as a 'lifetime membership' where your clients can enjoy regular services for a set price. It’s like Netflix for home maintenance! This gives them peace of mind knowing they’re covered, and you get the benefit of predictable income and loyal clients. It’s a win-win situation, cultivating community trust as you serve them consistently.

To wrap it all up, reviving this classic service is not just about pressing the refresh button; it’s about breathing new life into something beloved using the tools and channels of today. Embrace the community, uphold the faith that this service can thrive, and don’t shy away from modern solutions. After all, great ideas can shine brightest when they're paired with heartfelt service and community engagement. So let’s roll up our sleeves and get to work—God’s got some plans for this revival!",1,1742914067.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

I had a wonderful Filipina-Japanese bestfriend before. She was always there for me, made time for me, and did her best to love me like a brother. Sadly, my jealous ex-girlfriend threw me in a position to choose — and I chose my ex which is a decision I still regret today.

Now these days, I still have a few of my other bestfriends who are like my sisters in a way. However, they're all busy. I luckily have my girlfriend but I still miss having a best bud to talk about my day with, send food pics, or just share memes.

Yes! You heard it *right*. I am in a *relationship*. I'm very proud to have my girlfriend. However, we don't believe that we should restrict each other from having friends and forming new connections regardless of gender. She's allowed to have her friends and I'm allowed to have mine.

I've been rewatching the Kelvin timeline Star Trek films again. And there was a quote in the first one that struck me.

***""Because you needed each other. I could not deprive you of the revelation of all that you could accomplish together, of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize""***

So, I just want to form a really deep friendship. Someone that can be my best bud, the future ninong, ninang, or godparent to my kids! Someone that can eat food with me or share dank memes with.

I'll give an introduction about myself here:

- almost 26, loves video games, collecting anime figurines and IEMs, reading manga, and occasionally writing poetry.

- works in a finance related industry for my family.

- often spends time with my girlfriend eating good food, watching movies in the cinema, having coffee, and spending time with hers and mines friends :)

- willing to share Instagram/Facebook/Discord. I don't check Reddit all the time so I prefer to transfer platforms. You can also verify my identity through there lol

- **STRICTLY LOOKING FOR SFW FRIENDSHIPS** of course I want boundaries. I'm in a monogamous relationship and I'm not interested in any romantic formations with anyone else.

- has a mental illness, so if you do not like that then don't message.

About you:

- my age or older *preferably* BUT any age is welcome!

- I don't care about your gender! Just be kind, courteous, considerate, and chill to hang out with. 

- respectful to my girlfriend! This is very important to me.

- doesn't mind hanging out with me in person with me and my gf. I have itchy feet so I love going to the mall.

- won't ghost and actually tries to check up on me and message. 

- understands that I'm looking for **quality and not quantity** friendships.

- not a BBM support nor a Duterte supporter. With the current recent happenings with our politics, I need a friend that understands that we don't deserve those two shitty people running our country.

Anyways, I hope I find a friend here. I'll probably keep this post up for 48 hours and then delete it.

**Please send an introduction**. I might ignore your message if you just ""hi"" or ""hello""

Live long and prosper.

However when the weather gets a bit warmer, I just start craving more traditional neopolitan espresso, Turkish coffee etc. I think those darker coffees when the weather is nice just give me holiday vibes.

At the moment my go to traditional espresso beans is Kimbo Napoletano or Intenso. They give me on holiday in Italy vibes.

I know Lance Hedrick recommends Saka but in the UK it is very difficult to get a hold of.

So I was wondering, are any other espresso enthusiasts similar in that their palettes enjoy both spectrums of roasts?

If so, are there any decent specialty roasters that sell these types of beans? Any recommendations for something that fits the more traditional espresso but with a bit of an oomph? Thanks",1,1742913957.0,espresso,9,1.0,False
1jjl20d,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jjl20d/my_friends_father_was_taken_and_the_police/,My friend's father was taken and the police wouldn't help us for 48 hours. We should have waited. (Part 1),"Audrey and I weren't exactly close friends. I mean sure we'd shared a couple of classes last year, chatted a bit since we were stuck next to each other in geometry, but it wasn't much more. This year we were lab partners in Dr. Karper’s class so we exchanged numbers but the conversation hadn't extended further than “Hi” and “Is this Audrey?” followed by “Yup” and “Cool”.

Something odd happened last Tuesday, however. I was at work, bored out of my mind behind the counter. I was watching two of my classmates, completely baked, trying to pump gas. I was just waiting for them to realize the large “OUT OF ORDER” sign over the screen on the machine. Just as the one kid pointed up to the piece of copy paper we'd put up on the pump hours before, I felt a buzzing in my pocket.

Of course I knew it was my phone but considering my boss was working the night shift with me, I didn't want to take any chances. My parents would've killed me if I'd lost this job. In my head it was probably just a scam call anyway. I didn't have anyone I knew who would call me after 11pm on a Tuesday. 

I didn’t check my messages until I got home that night. I threw my work vest on my bed and shut the door behind me, collapsing into my desk chair as I did almost every night these days. I pulled my phone from my pocket and swiped through all the notifications I’d missed. Most of it was the same garbage my friends would always send but there was one that caught my eye. A new voice message from Audrey. I had to double take, honestly a little taken aback. We didn’t have any homework due, no project that needed discussion either. Essentially, unless she had somehow fallen in love with me that night and had to confess her feelings, she had no reason to be calling me at 11:16pm. And considering she already was dating somebody, I could safely rule that theory out.

Swiping away my friend's usual junk messages, I immediately went to call back Audrey, quickly jumping to the conclusion that I'd forgotten some school assignment we were supposed to do that night. The phone rang and I impatiently tapped my foot, leaning back on my desk as I waited for her to answer. She never did. I'll admit now it was extremely unlike her but in my own exhaustion from a long, tedious night at work, I didn't think enough of it and collapsed into my bed. I didn't think of a lot that night. Most importantly, I didn't think of listening to the message Audrey had left me.

When I woke up that morning, it wasn’t from the beep of my alarm clock or my mom’s incessant knocking. It was chilled air seeping through my bedroom window. I rolled up in a ball, trying to grasp whatever warmth I could from my bedsheet and blanket but to no avail. I didn’t realize where the cold breeze was coming from, begrudgingly sitting up to try to investigate. It was still dark, the moonlight shining in through the window. My eyes locked onto the window across the room from me. It was wide open, the curtains gently swaying from the draft that had been flowing in. 

I stared at it, puzzled. I almost never opened that window. In fact in my entire life, I could only recall two moments that window was ever opened. One was when I thought my Lego airplane could fly. The other was when I tried handing my dad lemonade as he was power washing the house. Neither ended very well. I cautiously stepped out of my bed, swinging both my legs out and begrudgingly standing up. I yawned as I shuffled over to the window. I examined the frame, the glass, the lock, anything that could have somehow let the incessant late autumn air into my room and disturbed my sleep. I shut the window, sliding the lock into place having failed to find the culprit. I jostled it a couple times to ensure it was secure before swinging around head back to bed. As I did so, something caught the corner of my eyes.

It took a few moments for my eyes to adjust to the darkness that enveloped the majority of my room but I could clearly make out a figure on the futon across from my desk. I froze in my tracks, my mind immediately jumping into fight or flight mode. My heart started to race as I tried to think of what the hell I was even going to do. My phone was still in my bed, if I tried opening the bedroom door it would make too much noise. I couldn’t even tell if they were awake, it was too dark to tell. They could have been staring right at me, spotlighted by the moonlight coming from the window. Then the figure shifted, sitting upright and seemingly wiping its face. It sniffed and snorted, as if it had been crying. Then it spoke.

“I-I’m sorry Charlie. I… I didn’t want to wake you up but… I didn’t know where else to go. I was scared. I-I am scared.” The voice said.

I knew the voice anywhere. It was Audrey. I never thought that Audrey Sheppard would be in my room, let alone be sleeping on my futon. We had a pretty platonic relationship and again, she had a boyfriend so even if either of us wanted more it would make things… ugly. But here she was, sad and scared. She looked awful. Her hair was a mess and it seemed she had scraped her arms climbing in through the window. She had dried tears down her cheeks and her eyes were tired and washed out. I switched on my desk lamp and immediately went to her side.

“W-what the hell happened?” I asked. She put her head in her hands and tried to hold back tears.

“My dad… s-someone took my dad…”

“Wait what? A-are you serious?” I asked, finding her statement a little hard to believe. Audrey had always been a pretty grounded person. In our boredom during geometry, there would be more than a few times we’d discuss hypotheticals to try to pass the time. I generally would think of the more far fetched answers and Audrey tended to be more realistic with hers. She always seemed to ruin my fun. With that in mind, I immediately knew she was in fact serious.

“Y-y-yeah… I-I mean… I could hear everything. He sounded… he sounded so scared.”

“Alright listen I’m sure there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for whatever happened. M-maybe you’re mom-”

“She had nothing to do with this.” Audrey snapped, shutting down my suggestion quickly. She took a deep breath. “Besides, I didn’t see a car.”

“Then who the hell was it?” I questioned. Audrey hesitated. 

“Well it… it looked like a man was in the hallway. I-I never saw him, just his shadow against the wall. The lights were off anyway. I-I was so scared Charlie. I couldn’t move. I didn’t move, not for an hour maybe. That’s when I called you.”

“And of course I was stuck at work with Roger all night. Fuck I wish I answered that call now.”

“I-it’s ok, really. I mean it’s not like our calls have really ever been about something fun.. o-or important honestly.” She tried to break a smile. “It’s always complaining about Dr. Karper while struggling with chem assignments. I’m not sure I’d risk my job just to hear that.”

“Hey come on, those conversations are fun in their own right.” I argued, trying to lighten the mood a little. She broke a smile for a moment and shrugged.

“I guess so.” Audrey admitted. 

“C-can I ask um…” I paused, questioning whether I should ask what had come to mind. “Why didn’t you call the police? O-or anybody else, honestly.”

Her face quickly sank back into reality, the fear returning to her eyes.

“The cops… they told me to call back if he didn’t show up in 48 hours. Two whole days. Said they can’t file a missing person’s report before that time period had been reached. A-and who else would even believe me? Carl is a great guy and all but I honestly think he’d call me crazy if I told him everything that happened.”

“Audrey, you haven’t even told me everything… I mean what exactly did you hear?”

She didn’t respond, just staring at me with her sorrowful blue eyes. She looked down, playing with her fingers for a moment before letting out a sigh.

“I-it started with the crying. I-I could hear him sobbing. Then… I heard him dragged… out of bed, fucking violently down the stairs…” She paused, trying to contain herself. “F-fuck sorry I um…”

“Hey listen it’s alright, we can just wait until the morning if you-”

“N-no it’s ok.” She took a deep breath. “I could hear every single hit his head took on every single stair. I-It’s like it was intentional… I-I even counted our staircase afterward. 15 steps. 15 bumps. And when he reached the bottom… I heard a crack. T-then… then a scream. He was slid across the wood floor and outside. His screams became distant… so distant it was almost as if I was hearing it in my head instead of outside. I was completely frozen… I-I seriously thought it was a nightmare. The last thing I heard… it must’ve been a full minute afterward… was the door slam shut. A-and I’m telling you Charlie, it was such a strong slam it knocked pictures off the wall. T-there’s still glass at the bottom of the stairs.”

I didn’t respond, I mean honestly how could I have? What I had been told was ridiculous, it was crazy, it was insane. But this was Audrey. It wasn’t some lunatic. And we weren’t in New Hampshire State Hospital. This was Hillsborough. The only claim to fame we’d ever had was being the childhood home of Franklin Pierce. But who is anyone kidding? Nobody could even remember what number President he was. Or that he was a president at all, honestly.

“Y-you don’t believe me… I-I’m so stupid I should’ve known this was-”

“Audrey,” I interrupted her, “I… I don’t know what happened to your dad. But I know you wouldn’t lie about this. I believe you… despite how fucked up this all is.”

She quickly wrapped her arms around me in a tight hug, resting her head on my shoulder.

“You have no idea what that means to me, Charlie. T-thank you… god thank you so much.”

We both quickly realized that as the first rays of sunlight began to lighten the night sky, we’d have to go to school that morning. And because my parents wouldn’t exactly approve of a girl they’d maybe met twice staying over in my room without their knowledge, we both thought it best that we get out of the house before they even wake up. That landed us in the parking lot of Hillsborough Diner far before either of us would normally dare wake up. I gave Audrey an old sweatshirt from my closet to cover up the tears made in her t-shirt from the climb up the tree and Band-Aids for the numerous cuts on her arms and hands. She owed us a fresh box.

Sitting down at the counter, the diner was surprisingly busy for six in the morning on a Wednesday. It was mainly commuters, naturally. Most were just grabbing a cup of coffee or a quick meal before heading to the bus stop down the street or jumping on 202. The waitress, a young woman probably in her mid twenties handed us menus with a peppy smile.	

“You guys are up pretty early, school doesn’t start for another hour or so if I remember right. Pull an all nighter for a project?” She asked. Audrey and I exchanged exhausted looks, turning back to the waitress and simply nodding. It wasn’t worth it to even attempt explaining our night. She laughed.	

“Well you look like zombies, no offense. So maybe I can get something to help you wake up?” She suggested, starting to pull out her pad and pen.

“I’ll just have um… some pancakes… and tea.” Audrey answered quietly.

“French omelet I guess and just uh… orange juice if you have it.” I followed. She quickly scribbled on her pad and stuffed it back into her pocket.

“Coming right up.”

We watched her walk back into the kitchen, pushing the doors open and letting them swing shut behind her. 

“I-I don’t know how I’m going to do this, Charlie.” Audrey admitted. “I can’t just pretend everything is fine.”

“I know but think about it this way… at school it might be safer.” I let out a sigh. “I never thought I’d be actually advocating to go to school but if… if there is someone or something out to get you or me or anyone, being in a bigger group would make it less likely something happens. A-and there’s more people to help if it does.”

“I guess you’re right.” She replied softly, looking down at the counter while twisting her silverware in her fingers. “I’m just scared.”

“Me too.” I admitted quietly. “I-I mean I honestly didn’t want to bring this up but um… you know what, nevermind. It’s stupid.” I quickly shut myself down. Audrey’s head shot over to face me, intrigue in her eyes.

“W-what? What didn’t you want to bring up?” She asked almost desperately.

“I-it’s nothing really. It’s du-”

“Charlie, what is it?” She cut me off, her voice stern. “I-I need to know. If it could help figure out what happened to my dad, tell me. Please.” She insisted. I didn’t immediately respond, almost scared of her reaction. She’d either think I was an idiot for suggesting it or she’d actually consider it. Either option I didn’t like the thought of.

“Well um… you moved to Hillsborough freshman year, right?” I started.

“Yeah, why?” She responded quickly, her words sharp. I hesitated to answer.

“I-if you’d grown up in town. And I mean like grown up since pre-school, kindergarten, that kind of age, you’d have heard of Hillsborough's urban legend.”

“Urban legend? What the fuck are you talking about?” 

“It’s a local story, you know. Like Bigfoot or the Mothman, jersey devil, that kind of thing.”

“Yeah I get what an urban legend is Charlie. What does it have to do with what happened to my dad?” She replied, almost annoyed at my dancing around the topic.

“N-nothing, honestly. It’s just a story.”

“Well I want to hear it. I don’t give a shit if it’s just a story.”

“Alright, alright. Jesus, it’s not even a real story. I-I don’t know if I even remember the whole thing. I probably haven’t heard it since 7th grade.”

“You totally do, come on out with it.”

“Fine,” I groaned.

Hillsborough is a boring town. I’ll be the first to admit it. But like most boring towns, the people who live there tend to try to find ways to make it interesting. To put it on the map, make a name for themselves. I’m not sure who came up with the story of the Weeping Widow but whoever they are, they were a bit messed up in the head.

During the first world war, the winter of 1917 to be more specific, a young bride of a Contoocook Cotton Mills worker got a knock on her door which she feared more than anything. Two army officers handed her a letter that her husband was dead, probably blown to pieces by an artillery shell or machine gun fire. People forget how gruesome world war one could be.

She was heartbroken, the love of her life stolen from her far too soon. Their home, isolated from town at the base of Thompson Hill, was now a prison where she would only be reminded of the world she lived in before her husband had been killed. She stopped seeing her friends, family and soon stopped leaving all together. For weeks people thought she had gone and left town along with the memories of her lost love. However, they were wrong. The widow walked from her home, now disheveled, starving and aggrieved. She walked into the center of town, uncontrollably crying with dark black stains around her eyes. Then, in broad daylight, jumped from the Hillsborough Bridge into the Contoocook River with the whole town watching.

Some people have been more brutal with the details than others, but for us as kids it was kept pretty PG. Nobody knows what happened to the body. Honestly there is no record of the event even happening. But the story became that of folk lore. A ghost story of a lost widow you could hear quietly sobbing through the woods. A feeling of being watched when walking alone on a dark empty street far later than you should be out. An angry spirit hell bent on snatching you up and dragging you down with it to steal your soul. That was the real impact of the Weeping Widow. Another monster story, meant to keep kids home in bed at night. 

Throughout the decades a few disappearances in the state forests kept the story of the Weeping Widow alive, some superstitious people attributing those very real tragedies to a ghost story. As a kid sometimes I’d think about the version of the story my mom or dad had told me, or the more graphic version I’d heard in the lunchroom at school. A sense of unease would come over me as I walked home from school. Or maybe while hiking with my friends I’d hear or see something seemingly nobody else did. But as we grew older, the story slowly lost its punch. It had gone from a terrifying tale parents used as a scare tactic to a high school bonfire story I’d heard told on more than one occasion lightheartedly. I even remember a few seniors went on a hunt one Halloween to try to get a picture of the Widow. Ultimately we all grew up, monsters weren’t real after all. 

When I’d finished telling the story, or the latest version I’d been told of it, Audrey looked at me with a bit of disbelief.

“H-how the hell have I never heard this?” She wondered, “I seriously can’t-”

“Audrey, stop” I cut her off. I let out a sigh, “It’s a story. A local folk legend. Please don’t tell me you’re actually considering this a possible explanation.” She didn’t respond, her eyes looking down at the counter almost with shame.

“I-I just want *any* explanation, Charlie.” She admitted, crossing her arms. 

“I’m sorry… so do I. But this is… this is not it. You of all people should know that.”

“I know… I know. I-it’s ridiculous.” She tried to tell herself. “Let’s just… stop talking about this right now. I don’t… I can’t think about it anymore.”

As if on queue, our waitress returned with two steaming plates of breakfast classics. We ate quickly, barely taking breaks between bites. It had felt like I’d already been up a whole day, I couldn’t even imagine how it felt for Audrey. 

After eating, we stepped out of the diner and into the crisp morning air. I dug in my pocket and pulled out my car key, the amber lights of the little gray sedan flashing as I tapped the unlock button. The car wasn’t exactly a chick magnet but it was free after all, and who turns down something that's free?

Audrey and I buckled in and I started up the engine. It puttered to life and I threw the shifter in drive. I looked over at her for a moment. She seemed deep in thought. She hadn’t said more than a few words since I told her the story of the Weeping Widow. I was worried about her. And I’d been kicking myself for even mentioning the damn legend in the first place. 

“H-hey are you alright? You haven’t spoken since we ate.” I asked, deciding to break the silence as we rounded a corner onto the aptly named School Street. 

“I uh… I’ve just been thinking about everything I guess.” She replied, still not fully present as she stared out the window.

“You’re still thinking about the Weeping Widow.” I concluded. She didn’t respond, just kept her eyes on the moving greenery outside. “We need to start thinking seriously, Audrey.”

“I’m being dead fucking serious, Charlie. What happened to my dad… I can’t fucking explain. There’s nothing, no logical explanation for why or how it happened.” She took a deep breath. “Listen, if you don’t want to keep going in this direction with me, that’s fine. But after school, I’m going to go to the library and see if there’s anything about those disappearances you mentioned. O-or about the Widow herself. Just… just anything to help.”

I swung the car into a parking spot in the student lot and slid the shifter in park. The car rested and I shut off the engine, pulling the key from the ignition. Then, I turned to face her.

“Look, I-I’m not leaving your side. You roped me into it, now you’re stuck with me. For better or for worse. I honestly doubt we’re going to find anything at the library but… who the fuck knows. Maybe I’m wrong.” I insisted. 

“R-really? You’ll come with me?” She asked, a bit of surprise and a hint of relief in her voice.

“Yeah. The fact that you came to me of all people last night for help… I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night knowing I just abandoned you when you needed my help.” I admitted. Her face brought out a small smile.

“Thanks, Charlie. That um… that means a lot.”

As we walked through the doors of Hillsboro-Deering High School, a strange feeling hung over me. Everyone was oblivious to what had happened last night. And yes, of course they would be. Neither Audrey nor I had said a word to anybody. Despite that, it still felt as thought we were hiding something. We had to pretend that everything was fine. I’d never had to fake how I acted on an everyday basis. And as the doors shut behind us, we both had to relearn to be ourselves.

“I’ll catch you in class, I-I see Carl at his locker.” Audrey told me, separating from me as she weaved through the morning rush to reach her boyfriend. Carl Pearson was Hillsborough’s future baseball team captain. He’d always been surprisingly nice, ever since we were kids. I wouldn’t say I was ever exactly friends with the guy but he wasn’t that typical athlete either. He and Audrey had started dating at the end of Freshman year and they seemed happy together. Today however, one half would be genuine while the other tried desperately to be.

I was knocked out of my own daze by Ben, one of my best friends. He’d probably tried texting me a hundred times since last night but I didn’t even bother trying to respond. 

“Charlie, what the hell dude where have you been? Didn’t you get any of my texts?” He asked with a bit of playful annoyance in his voice. It took a minute for me to answer, my mind starting to slow as the lack of sleep was finally catching up with me.

“I um… y-you know I had work, man. Roger would’ve fired me.” I tried to explain.

“Oh yeah, but what about after? Kyle and I went out to the pond last night. You missed out dude, these seniors brought a full 24 pack. It got crazy.”

I tried to crack a smile as if I was honestly interested. “I’m sure it was, I-I guess I was just really tired last night.”

“I get it dude, it's all good.” Ben assured me. “You know what was the craziest part though? We heard some actually scary noises out in the woods last night. Sounded like nothing I’ve ever heard before. Then again, I had a couple in me already.”

My eyes widened. “W-wait, what? When did you hear those sounds? Where did they come from?” I asked a little frantically, losing my cool quickly.

“I-I don’t know, man. It was kind of late.” He stopped to think for a moment. “After ten if I were to guess. Probably came from up at Thompson Hill. That’s where those rednecks live around Kimball Corner.”

I didn't want to believe it but there was no denying it was a damn perfect coincidence. My brain ran a million miles a minute as Ben looked at me a little confused.

“A-are you alright, Charlie?” He asked. “You look like you saw a ghost.”

“It’s been uh… I-I had a rough night. That’s all.” I admitted, suppressing my thoughts. He smirked.

“I saw you walk in with Audrey Sheppard this morning. What was all that about?” He asked slyly. I rolled my eyes.

“Come on man, we've already had this conversation. She just um… needed a ride this morning. Something about her dad not being able to take her.” I tried to explain. He laughed.

“Sure buddy, whatever you say. I wouldn’t want to get on Carl’s bad side either.”

I shoved him playfully, “You can be such a dick sometimes.”

“I know, I pride myself on it.” He admitted.

The school day felt longer than any other I could remember. After first period, I felt like a zombie, roaming aimlessly through the day and simply existing to fill my seat. In chemistry, Audrey and I didn’t say a word to each other the entire time. She dozed off at least three times and I was becoming dangerously close myself. Dr. Karper didn’t seem to notice as our seats were in the back row but I had designated myself as the lookout just in case. 

When the day ended, Audrey was waiting for me at my car. She yawned as she leaned against the hood, arms crossed. Her eyes were heavy and her expression tired.

“That was…” She started.

“Awful” I finished. “Do you still want to-”

“Absolutely.” She cut me off, answering before I could even finish my sentence. Without another word, we took our seats in the car. I started it up, the engine’s hum filling the cabin as we pulled back out of the parking lot and onto School Street.

The Hillsborough Library wasn’t far from the school, then again everything in town was fairly close together. Within only a few turns and a couple more minutes, we’d parked behind the old building. The library was housed in a huge old yellow Victorian, with white trim and a stone brick foundation. A sign hung from the stairs of the long wrapping porch that read “Fuller Public Library” along with a sagging banner that used to display “Book Fair” but now much of it was illegible.

The entire school day I’d been in a daze, thinking about what Ben had mentioned to me before the first bell. It had to be just a coincidence but I also had to admit, it scared me a little more than I would’ve liked. The thought of mentioning it to Audrey made me even more worried she’d completely accept that a monster had stolen her father for seemingly no reason. But despite my reservations, I knew I had to break the news to her.

“So um… after we split up this morning” I started.

“Yeah?” She replied, pushing open the tall wooden door into the library’s main lobby.

“I-I was talking to Ben and um… he was out late last night at the Pond and well” I paused. Audrey gave me a confused look. “Well he said that they heard some… sounds coming from up on Thompson Hill.” Her tired expression immediately switched.

“D-did they say what ti-”

“It was after ten. At least that was his guess. He didn’t really describe what he heard but it seemed like whatever it was really freaked him out.” I admitted.

“Charlie y-you know that almost perfectly lines up with-”

“You don’t need to remind me. I just don’t want you to jump to any conclusions. It’s weird, yes but that’s assuming that anything about a local folk story is true.” I insisted.

“I know, that’s why we’re here anyway. So um… where do you think the town records would be?” She questioned. I shrugged.

“Beats me, I haven’t been in this place since middle school. I guess we could ask somebody at the desk.” 

The lady working at the checkout desk seemed ancient, as if she had sat in that same spot for a hundred years or more. This building was her domain and she was simply giving us the privilege to roam its halls. She watched us approach without lifting her head, her eyes tracing our path as we approached her. She spoke to us in short bursts, her words quiet but being heard loud and clear. She was skeptical when we asked to see Hillsborough’s records, like we were asking to see the crown jewel of her treasure hoard. With a bit of convincing from Audrey however, the old lady reluctantly agreed to take us to the records room. 

She hobbled off her chair and grabbed a comically large ring of keys. They jingled in her hand as we slowly followed her up the stairs to the second floor of the converted mansion. Reaching a solid dark wood door, she stopped short and began fishing for the right key. With a look of satisfaction, she took an old iron key and stuck it into the lock of the door, twisting it as the door opened with a satisfying click. Instructing us to lock the door when we left, she gave the room a long scan with her eyes before leaving us alone on the second floor. 

The records room was not large, likely an old bedroom when the building had been a house. Now it was a plainly painted room littered with filing cabinets, computers and scanning machines. We split the small space in half, trying to compile as much information as we could about the town’s urban legend. To be honest, I’m not sure exactly what drove me to dig through countless files for what was starting to feel like at least an hour. Audrey’s purpose was clear but my own I couldn’t quite place. I wanted to help my friend, that was obvious enough. But I suppose my own curiosity was starting to get the best of me. And in the back of my mind, a doubt was starting to grow about how confident I was that nothing of the story was true. Perhaps I’d just told myself so many times it wasn’t real, I simply started to believe it.

We’d occasionally snatch a document from one of the drawers or save a file on the computer but much of what we found had very little to do with the Weeping Widow. Audrey compiled everything on one of the open desks, laying out the documents in a rough chronological order in record time. Sometimes I forgot how smart she was and more importantly how lucky I was to have her as a lab partner. I’d be screwed without her.

We looked over everything, trying to put together some kind of pattern. Most of the documents were old, black and white newspaper clippings long yellowed and curling in the corners. Audrey had focused on trying to find any mention of the story from 1917, the supposed date of the event itself. I was more interested in putting together the missing persons cases I remember my parents telling me about. 

There was seldom mention of the Weeping Widow by name minus a couple of opinion pieces dating from the 1970s as well as a “Weird History” section of New Hampshire Magazine dating from the late 1990s. But after looking over everything, especially taking notice of the missing persons cases, lost hikers and uncovered remains, we both started to notice a pattern. We searched up the victims, some being Hillsborough residents along with a couple of tourists or travelers. They mostly lived very different lives, some from very different parts of the county and all from different times in the past century. But one thing was the same amongst them all. They had all lost their husbands or their wives.

Audrey looked up at me with a sense of fear in her eyes as we both came to that same conclusion. I gave her a confused reaction.

“W-what are you so nervous about? Doesn’t look like there's been a case like this in twenty years. It’s a weird coincidence, sure but-” I started nonchalantly, tossing one of the files onto the table.

“My dad… my dad was-*is*… he is a widower” She admitted, sinking into the chair behind her. “My stepmom Debra… she died when I was 13. That’s actually why my Dad moved us to Hillsborough. I guess he couldn’t stand living in the same house they’d shared together.”

I didn’t respond, quietly taking a seat next to her. Audrey quietly started to cry, overwhelmed with more emotion than I could imagine. I tried my best to comfort her, my own thoughts racing a thousand miles a minute. This still had to be just a big coincidence. It had to be. Monsters aren’t real. This is Hillsborough, not Transylvania. But I had to admit, I was curious. I wanted to say I knew the Weeping Widow wasn’t real. I wanted to say it without a shadow of a doubt. But somewhere deep in the back of my mind there was a doubt. And it worried me.

We didn’t stay in the records room much longer. We’d copied whatever documents we found important enough and quickly went for the exit. The sun was fleeting in the sky as we made our way back to the car. We each pulled open our respective doors and sat down, the whistling wind outside being snuffed out as we encased ourselves inside. There was a long silence, both of us having the same thought but clearly nervous to admit it to each other.

“We have to look for it.” Audrey finally spoke, a measure of insistence in her voice.

“W-what?” I asked in clarification.

“The Widow’s house. W-we need to rule it out. Let’s be honest, if we don’t just go up there and prove to ourselves that there’s nothing in that forest, it’s going to be in the back of our minds forever.” She explained. I knew she was right. But I also knew she didn’t really believe what she was saying. And neither did I.

Hey there!  

I’m a 25-year-old from Punjab,India , currently living in Italy—because apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me—I’m into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we’ll probably get along great. If not, don’t worry—I promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me—whether it’s sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn’t call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won’t argue. Probably.  

So if you’re up for a chat—whether it’s about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport—drop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who’s down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn’t call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won’t argue. Probably.  

So if you’re up for a chat—whether it’s about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport—drop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who’s down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

1jjkus3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jjkus3/i_accidentally_asked_my_crush_out_what_do_i_do/,"I accidentally asked my crush out, what do I do?","Okay, I just need to get this off my chest because I don’t know whether to bury myself or just laugh about it.
I (20f) have recently developed a crush on a guy (19m) from my class at uni. We haven’t really talked that much but I just think he’s cool and I wouldn’t mind getting to know him. I’ve been trying really hard to keep it cool since I tend to develop feelings really fast and thus go too fast.

The thing is today we had a group activity related to filming, and while we were waiting to start filming, he (as the cameraman) asked a classmate (who was gonna get filmed) if they wanted their feet to show (they were wearing shoes, it was just about the frame). So I jokingly said “There’s people who pay uni selling foot pics” and I told him “If you want to see their feet, you should pay them”. And we (and the other classmates) laughed and said a couple of other things, and then he asked me directly if I have pretty feet, and I just told him to pay me if he wants to find out.
Then they told us to start filming, and after that, when we were waiting again, he brought up the subject again (I didn’t because I didn’t want to be annoying), so I asked him “So how much are you willing to pay?” and he looked like he didn’t really know what to say. He kinda laughed about it, but he didn’t get to answer because they told us to start filming again. Even the classmates at this point were like “Damn, I’m kinda curious about his answer”.

After that, we switched spots, so he and I were in one side of the studio, and there was the classmate from before too. Then one of them said something along the lines of “Should we talk about something?” so, intending to follow the joke, I told my crush “[His name], a coffee?”. What I meant with that was “Are you willing to pay for a coffee (that amount of money, not necessarily a coffee) in exchange for a feet pic?” as a joke. The thing is he apparently thought I was inviting him for a coffee or something like that, and he said “No”. I was confused because that didn’t sound like an answer to what I was asking, so I repeated “No?” and he said “I don’t drink coffee” and the classmate from earlier said they didn’t either. Perpetually confused, I said “I don’t, either”. And then I realized he had misunderstood the question, and I had just gotten rejected. In situations like this, I usually need time to assess and process the situation, so that added to the fact that we were working, ended up in me not explaining the misunderstanding, and after that I just felt awkward. Especially because, for once, I wasn’t actually making a move, so to get rejected like that definitely stung. Of course, I wouldn’t have asked him out for many reasons: we have barely talked, it wasn’t the right place or time, and there was this other person listening, who witnessed it all.

So I don’t know what to do now. I’m sad because we get along so well, especially when it comes to humor. I’m worried he will distance himself from me to make clear he’s not interested, or maybe because I make him uncomfortable now. I really thought we could’ve been something if I played it out well, even just being friends. What do you guys think? What do I do now?",0,1742913419.0,Advice,3,0.5,False

I don't even know where to start.,"I apologize in advance, this is probably going to be long. If I don't spill out here, I'm afraid I'm going to go all ""crazy"" on social media. I am here every single day reading your posts and comments. They are one of my only comforts. 

Aside from the absolute heartbreak of dealing with my baby brother's death (he was a month shy of 14 years my junior and I feel like I lost a child), dealing with a funeral that absolutely wasn't planned for *him*... I'm now having to deal with his girlfriend and her family (he lived with them for 2/3 years).

This has to be one of the worst parts. I *made it through* the initial shock and first few days, I *made it though* the viewing, I *made it through* the funeral, I *made it through* the literal non stop thoughts racing through my head - getting a shower (brother slit his wrists and hung himself), getting a coffee (brother slit his wrists and hung himself), in a conversation with someone (brother slit his wrists and hung himself) *nonstop the first 2 weeks*. I *made it through* so much. 

This should be the *easy* stuff, handling his affairs. We have an attorney friend helping us, which is absolutely amazing and I am so thankful for and my husband is handling all of the paperwork with him.

My mother is next of kin, everything is being transferred to her. His truck and motorcycle are being kept for sentimental reasons. None of us want or care about *anything* other than a few small personal items, books, photos, his own personal cook book that he hand wrote ❤️. Unfortunately, getting his personal items has not been that easy.

I'm sure I've mentioned this in other posts here, but I found out (through their own admission), that my brother was having a severe mental ""breakdown"" his entire last week on earth. He only disclosed this to the gf and her family. He showed no signs to his coworkers until the night of. They knew he was having a crisis and did not reach out to us (they know mental health issues run in the family), did not try to get him mental health, did not call 911 as a last resort (I'd rather have him baker acted than dead).

Since then, I've obtained his phone, and police records. I've read every text of him begging this girl for help and her being like, well, everyone is sleeping now, we will figure it out tomorrow! For days he confided in her. Told her the wildest things. Clearly, *clearly*, he needed inpatient treatment.

*Aside* from that, the police records show several things. She said on record she knew he needed help that week. She said on record she knew mental health issues run in the family. Last and most importantly, she *said he had been cutting himself* and that very night before she went to bed she asked him if he had been hurting himself again. He said yes. She went to BED. 

I am LIVID. 

I don't want to have to deal with these people anymore. I don't want to have to think of them ever again. I want to mourn my brother and I *can't*.

The first week we asked for his personal belongings, they gave us his truck, and a few boxes of items. My brother was a minimalist, so no big deal. We said we'd have to tow his motorcycle, as it wouldn't fit on the truck. (for clarification, these items belong solely to my brother, she has never worked a single job ever - mid 30s, and we weren't asking for ""mutual items""). I've already given this info here, but the mom made us pick up his items from the garage he hung himself in and left the noose in plain sight. 

When we eventually went through his items, she had given us his old packed away attic items. Not anything that was current. Ok, fine, whatever. I expected her to keep some stuff. I understand she's mourning even though I hold her and her family responsible. 

They were invited to the funeral and didn't attend.

My husband reached out to set up a time for the tow truck to arrive. All hell breaks loose. The mom starts writing my mom that ""her children"" only want brother's items (it's actually my mom that wants her dead son's  items lol, but I'll take the hit), and that we started writing her for his items ""while he was still swinging from the noose"", (none of us even had her contact information at that time, ridiculous). She described the scene in detail to my mom, who was being shielded from that info, as she didn't want to know. 

Why did they want to keep the motorcycle? The 4 year old daughter (not my brother's kid, thank god) says it reminds her of my brother. Yea, okay lady.

Even if she wanted the damn bike, that's just not how it works. It has to all be transferred over to my mom, then she can give it to whoever tf she wants. My husband tried explaining this to her, and she is still refusing. 

So that is my annoying suicide drama at the moment. Dealing with a family that, in my opinion, let my brother die. I'm ""not allowed to contact them"", per my husband, because I *will* lose my ever loving shit on them. 

I just want to fucking mourn my brother. I have a few of his books, his ashes, honestly, I don't even need the books. I've read them all before, it was something we bonded over, and I have that. I'm so sick of this shit. 

I know my brother had no control over what he did, I've read what he texted, I've read what he was googling, I completely understand he was absolutely not of sound mind. I am not a single iota of angry with him. But if anyone ""of sound mind"" pulls this shit in my circle again, I am not handling it. I simply won't.

I know this post sounds very I, I, I. I assure you, this is my only place to be *I*, in real life I am taking care of *everyone* else, even my 20ish year estranged father - but that's a whole other post. My husband is handling the paperwork, but even he seems to be a little *get over it already* as the days pass... thank you for letting me type that all out. I know I need a therapist. I'm trying to get one, it is not as easy as it should be. My children luckily do have one. ",2,1742913139.0,SuicideBereavement,1,1.0,False

I won’t say *experienced radical ontopographical distortion*, or *underwent dimensional-psychic-visa-viz-metamorphosis*, though I might say *transformative teleological terrain transfer* because like my father before me I enjoy a good alliteration. 

Laughlin was always funny. Back when brother fought brother, it was considered cursed, five miles by six of what should’ve just been sand and rock gnarled with more trees than most nearby countryside. A jungle crammed where there shouldn’t be one. Imprisoned, maybe. 

The coast was asleep when it happened. Two decades on, we might as well still be, Laughlin lingering like an unwelcome visitor. Can’t see the trees now behind the wall, or through the glare of floodlights. What little we do get when they send some egghead to sweat in cramped town halls is so buried in scientific euphemism that it’s easier to bet on how many bottles of water the speaker will down than parse his meaning. I figure twelve, especially now, it’s hotter than it ever was when I was a gnat. 

Back when the walls first went up, the pilgrim trespassers followed. What became a few cars left here and there at the station or on the roadside, picked up by tow every few weeks, has spiraled. A frozen stampede of Bentleys, beat-up fords, curtain-windowed vans and everything between sits, waiting for owners who will never come back. I got coffee on, waiting for the tow to come by. He’s a busy man. 

When he comes but before he starts his work, we’ll sit right out in front, sipping our mugs. We’ll pick out a car here or a truck there, and imagine who brought it all this way. Make history out of license plates and bumper stickers. And all the while, out in the bay, Laughlin will sit and watch and keep its secrets forevermore. ",1,1742913076.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

Transforming your living room into an inviting space that embodies antique farmhouse decor is a trend that brings warmth and charm into your home. This style combines rustic elements with vintage pieces, making it perfect for creating a cozy atmosphere. To achieve an antique farmhouse look, consider integrating various key components that define this timeless aesthetic.

Start with the furniture. Look for reclaimed wood pieces such as coffee tables, sideboards, and armchairs. These items not only offer uniqueness but also showcase a history that instantly adds character. Pairing these with soft, neutral fabrics can soften the overall look while maintaining a rustic feel.

When it comes to color schemes, earthy tones play a crucial role in antique farmhouse decor. Shades of cream, beige, and muted greens or blues work beautifully to create a serene environment. Accent walls painted in farmhouse-inspired colors can serve as a stunning backdrop for your antique decorations.

Accessorizing is essential in creating a cohesive antique farmhouse living room. Incorporate vintage wall art, old clocks, and weathered mirrors. A collection of farm tools or old books displayed on shelves can serve as conversation starters while enhancing the decor’s authenticity. Use jute or sisal rugs to add texture and comfort underfoot.

Lighting can also impact the ambiance significantly. Opt for wrought iron fixtures or lantern-style lamps that echo a rustic vibe. Dimmer switches can help you adjust the lighting to suit various moods throughout the day.

For finishing touches, bring in natural elements like potted plants or dried flowers in mason jars. These details embody the essence of farmhouse living and connect the indoor space with the beauty of nature.

Creating an antique farmhouse decor living room is about mixing the old with the new, allowing personality and comfort to shine through. With thoughtful selections, your living room can become a welcoming space that reflects the elegance of vintage charm.

1jjknhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jjknhi/my_girlfriend_and_i_just_broke_up_but_everything/,My girlfriend and I just broke up but everything seemed to be going perfect,Pretty much what the title says we’ve been dating for 3 months (I know not very long but I’m 18 now and it feels like my first heart break). Yesterday was our 3 months and we had plans to go into the city for a nice dinner and to go bowling. Earlier that day she had come over and we watched a movie while cuddling and just chilling and everything seemed to be going great we were laughing and play wrestling all the things that made us happy. Then I dropped her off at her house so she could get ready for tonight while I went to get a haircut. After my haircut was done she text me that she’d like to talk to me about something before we had went on our date. I paid no mind to it as we’re usually pretty open and I assumed it was about the cost of everything as she had mentioned splitting the bill earlier today so I didn’t have to pay for everything. Once I got to her house she came outside and told me “I don’t want to lead you on and I don’t feel a click with you and you deserved a better person” she then walked back inside and sent me a text saying she’s sorry and that was that. It’s been a day now and I got very little sleep last night because all I can do is think about the happy memories I’ve made with her from going to church every Sunday and our little coffee dates. Maybe I’m just overthinking but there was no signs that there was any problems in our relationship and it feels odd to me she didn’t come and talk to me before making this decision she simply said a sentence and left me there.

1jjkmv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wizardposting/comments/1jjkmv7/company_briefing/,Company Briefing,"
The elevator chimed softly as it arrived at the ground floor of The Company’s headquarters. From the outside, the building looked like any other corporate tower—clean glass panels, polished metal doors, and a steady stream of employees coming and going with coffee cups in hand.  

Inside, the lobby buzzed with the hum of conversation. Desks were neatly arranged, plants thrived under gentle lighting, and a friendly receptionist greeted arrivals. It felt almost comforting, like any bustling office environment. One could easily forget the rumors about what happened on the upper floors.  

But not everyone could forget. The new hire, a young woman who had only been with The Company for a few months, clutched a single slip of paper in her trembling hands. It bore a simple message:  

EXECUTIVE SUMMONS – 42ND FLOOR  

She stepped into the elevator alone, heart pounding in her ears. As the doors slid shut, she reminded herself to breathe. “It’s probably just a routine meeting,” she whispered, trying to believe her own words. Everyone said the same thing, of course. And they all knew how rarely anyone came back unchanged.  

The first few floors flew by quickly, each stop revealing normal office life—teams chatting about weekend plans, supervisors cracking jokes, interns scurrying around with files. She almost allowed herself to relax.  

But then the elevator passed the 20th floor, and things started to shift.  

The doors slid open again, and the hallway outside was silent. The lights overhead were colder, whiter. The walls were bare, the carpeting thinner. Employees moved in hushed steps, their eyes downcast, as though even breathing too loudly might draw attention. When she tried to smile at a passing coworker, they looked away.  

She pressed the button for the 42nd floor. The elevator doors closed again, and she continued upward.  

With each floor, the hush deepened. A strange heaviness settled in her limbs, as if the very air were pressing down on her. She found herself gripping the rail for support, an inexplicable ache forming in her joints. Her reflection in the elevator doors looked paler, older.  

At the 35th floor, the doors opened onto a corridor with walls so colorless they bordered on gray. A few suits glided by without so much as a glance in her direction. She realized they all walked with perfectly straight postures, their faces drained of expression. The entire space smelled faintly of antiseptic. Or maybe that was her imagination.  

She tried to swallow her fear. Just seven more floors.  

By the time the elevator reached the 42nd floor, her heart felt like it might burst. She stepped out into a stark foyer with a single black door at the far end. A low hum resonated in the silence, like a machine running somewhere out of sight.  

She approached the door slowly. Her legs felt heavy, as though each step aged her a year. The door itself had no handle—just a small, recessed panel. She placed her hand against it, and it clicked open with a hiss of pressurized air.  

Inside was a massive, dimly lit office. The floor-to-ceiling windows revealed a panoramic view of the city, but the glass was tinted so dark it was hard to make out the skyline. A long table stood at the center, surrounded by high-backed chairs. The Executives sat in them, silhouettes against the tinted light.  

No one spoke at first. She couldn’t make out their faces—just the faintest reflections of eyes watching her. Waiting.  

A single voice broke the silence, low and measured, like a distant echo:  
“Welcome.”  

Her hands shook at her sides. She felt older than she had that morning, as though she had lived a lifetime in the short journey upward. Her lips parted, but no words came. There was nothing to say. The Executives had summoned her, and she had arrived. That was enough.  

“You may approach,” said another voice, equally calm, equally commanding.  

She took a breath, forcing her feet to move. Each step reverberated in the hush. She thought about the friendly receptionist on the ground floor, the bright lobby, the chatter of coworkers. It all seemed so far away now, like a dream she barely remembered.  

When she finally stood at the head of the table, the chairs loomed around her like sentinels. She waited, throat tight, certain that whatever happened next would define the rest of her life—if she still had a life to return to.  

In that moment, she realized there was no escape. The corridor behind her was silent, the elevator a distant memory. This was The Company. And here, on the 42nd floor, she understood the truth of all those rumors:  

No one ever came back the same.

Monte Puncu, Bolivia

“The agent they murdered. You knew him?” Dominic Rubio, callsign “Nomad”, asked the question so abruptly that Central Intelligence Agency officer Karen Bowman felt compelled to answer him right away.

“He was a friend of mine,” Bowman said simply before turning to look out at the Bolivian jungle.

“Sorry for your loss,” Nomad said, taking a deep breath. 

“I could say it comes with the job, but it doesn’t get any easier.” Bowman replied.

“No, it doesn’t,” Nomad replied.

Nomad, a tall, mixed-race man with dark hair and light brown eyes, checked his P416 assault rifle before adjusting his headset. Then he looked at his teammates, Ajay “Midas” Ghale, Rex “Holt” Perryman, and Corey “Weaver” Ward. They all stared back flatly.

Nomad then looked back at Bowman. “I’m guessing you’ve been down here a while?”

“I’ve been living as Karen Bowman, international aid worker, for about five years now,” Bowman said. There was something in the way she’d said it that caught Nomad’s attention.

Was it how hollow it sounded? He couldn’t be sure, but he chose to disregard it for now.

“It means living rough,” Bowman continued. “But as a cover, it gets me out and about.”

“At least it comes with a chopper,” said Nomad.

Midas, a former United States Marine, turned to his buddy Weaver. “How’d you get in-country?”

“Flew in business class from Mexico City,” said Weaver. “Hey, I’m refreshed and ready to work, right? I drank about four coffees before boarding the helicopter.”

Nomad stared in disbelief. “Four? Please do us all a favor and don’t go bouncing off the walls. We need you to be level-headed for this.”

Holt laughed. “Always. Anyway, Midas, how’d you get in-country?”

“Hitched a ride from Peru,” said Midas. Then he turned to Holt. “You?”

“Got on a bus in Argentina, drank all the way to Villazon,” said Holt. “Nobody likes dealing with drunkards on a bus.”

“Must explain why you smell like piss,” said Weaver.

The team was silent for about four minutes before Bowman said, “I heard rumors about you guys, heard you were involved in a coup in Russia?”

“That wasn’t us,” Nomad said flatly.

“Not every day you get to meet an urban legend in the flesh,” said Bowman. 

“Tell that to my kid,” said Nomad. “Maybe he’d listen whenever I ask him to take out the trash.”

No one responded. Bowman then asked Nomad, “Is it difficult, being someone who doesn’t officially exist?”

Nomad said nothing. Bowman said to the rest of the team, “I’m sure you’ve seen the depths of human depravity when there are zero repercussions. But let me tell you this right now, nothing will prepare you for what El Sueño has done, or is capable of doing. He’s got a religious streak that borders delusional levels, taken vows of chastity, the whole nine. If he ain’t in for the money, he’s in for the power.”

She looked at the team. “This is a joint operation between J-SOC, the Agency and the DEA. I’m your resident spook for this ride. Welcome to Operation Kingslayer.”

“Our briefing said there was more than one team on the ground, and that we’d be inserted with a contingent of locals,” Nomad said.

Bowman nodded. “Yes on both counts. The locals are part of a rebel movement called the Kataris 26, led by a guy named Pac Katari. We’ll meet him once we touch down. Bolivians have a long history of hating us Yankees but this time, let’s hope the enemy of my enemy will be my friend.”

Nomad was about to respond when he suddenly noticed a flash off in the distance.

So did Bowman.

At that exact moment, the unmarked helicopter’s cockpit instruments lit up like a Christmas tree. 

“Damn it,” Bowman hissed at the same time Nomad shouted, “SAM launch! SAM launch!”

“Where the hell did they come from?” The pilot barked.

“Everyone hang on!” Nomad and Bowman both shouted simultaneously.

There was a massive explosion, and then the entire aircraft began spinning wildly as the pilot screamed into his radio in Spanish, “Mayday! Mayday! This is Hammer 6-2! We are going down! I repeat, we are going down, two miles south of-!”

The last thing Nomad remembered before darkness overtook him was Bowman screaming his callsign.

…

Tabacal, Northern Bolivia

“He’s hit! He’s hit!” I shouted frantically as everyone in the patrol fled in random directions. The helicopter continued spinning overheard, the underbelly of the helicopter nearly knocking off my baseball cap before it continued spinning wildly towards an empty field. 

It all happened so fast; one moment, I was patrolling with the Kataris 26, and the next I was sprinting for my life as the helicopter plummeted towards the ground. 

It all started when we spotted the helicopter, which we thought was Unidad’s, flying overhead. Then, before we could get to cover, the chopper suddenly exploded as the tail rotor was obliterated thanks to a SAM launcher or RPG-I couldn’t tell which, and the helicopter spun out of control.

As we all bolted for cover, I caught a glimpse of someone attempting to hang on for dear life. 

They weren’t La UNIDAD, that much was clear. But who were they? Before I could get a better look, the chopper plowed through an empty field before resting against a boulder directly behind the abandoned farm. 

I’m getting Blackhawk Down vibes all over again! I thought as I directed my rebel buddies towards the crash site. “I saw someone still inside while it was going down,” I said. “Let’s go see if they’re still breathing.”

“Hold it, get back,” One of the rebels shouted. My rebel buddy Carmelo Bejano grabbed my shoulder, before suddenly swinging his AK-74 in the direction of several figures approaching.

Just then, someone shouted, “¡Contacto! Everyone get down!”

Then bullets whizzed over my head as I ducked behind a piece of stone wall. “Return fire!” I barked, my finger working the trigger until the AKM rifle I was using ran dry. 

“RPG! Look out!” I was suddenly yanked to the ground seconds before the RPG whizzed over my head. 

A second RPG hit the ground to my rear, launching me over the wall and into the field, the rifle flying out of my hands and cartwheeling across the field as I hit the ground! I felt myself rolling before I came to a stop a few feet from the crashed helicopter.

“Jock!” I heard Miguel Cuya shouting as I struggled to my feet. I quickly turned left and pulled out my SIG Sauer P227, firing at the advancing hostile forces.

I saw several dark-suited mercenaries intermingling with the goons wearing red-green civilian clothing. I dropped one of them, then seized hold of his weapon, a QBB-88 machine gun. 

I quickly took cover behind the crashed helicopter and proceeded to unload on the advancing hostiles. The QBB-88 roared to life, unleashing a hail of brass that cut through the hostiles like wheat on the Day of Harvest.

Adrenaline coursed through my body as I held the trigger down, working the muzzle back and forth like a fire hose until I had annihilated much of the resistance.

Once the LMG was empty I let it fall, scooped up a fallen gunman’s H&K G3A3, and turned to the now-unconscious passenger.

The passenger was a woman, blonde, blue eyed, and wore desert brown camouflage clothes, and a light gray headset. A neck gaiter serving as a face mask concealed her face from the nose down. She wore a backpack that contained radio equipment. 

I checked for a pulse. It was faint but it was definitely there. Then I heard a male voice groaning. 

I turned and caught a glimpse of one of the male passengers, a white male with light brown hair, and brown eyes. He was wearing a black patrol cap, black T-shirt, black pants and light brown Kevlar vest. 

“Friendlies!” I shouted. “I’m with the rebels!”

The man looked up at me and then his face twisted into confusion. “Y-you don’t look like one,” He said, before suddenly turning his attention to something to my right. 

I followed his gaze and saw them: a pair of pickup trucks had materialized in front of me. I raised my rifle, just as the mounted machine guns opened up, the bullets cutting the helpless survivor to shreds seconds before I could return fire.

I managed to hit one gunner, then chucked a grenade at the pickups before crawling inside the chopper wreck.

The female passenger had regained consciousness by this point but before she could acknowledge my presence, a wayward bullet impacted her vest. 

The two of us screamed, the woman in pain and I in rage as I opened up on the second gunner, taking him out in no time.

“Just hold on!” I told her. “I’ll be right there!”

The woman had pulled out an FN Five-Seven and was taking potshots at the enemy. 

“The enemy is here!” I heard an accented voice barking in English. 

“Alive, the colonel wants them alive,” A second voice shouted.

“¡Vete al diablo!” I roared, unleashing another burst of gunfire at the advancing soldiers. The G3 chattered to life, then clicked empty.

“Drat!” I hissed. Then I dropped the G3, then noticed the HK416 that was right next to the woman’s leg.

“Sorry, I need that!” I said, picking up the rifle and performing a brass check. 

The mag was full. The rifle wasn’t even used.

It’s on! Let ‘em have it! 

Before I could raise it, one of the mercs suddenly charged in my direction. 

Oh, no you don’t! Letting the rifle fall, I fired a powerful, right-handed jab to the man’s sternum. Before the man even knew what hit him, I pulled my P227 and finished him off with two shots to his chest and one to the head. 

“Nerede o?” I heard one of the gunmen shouting in Turkish. “Görüntü alamıyorum!”

“I’m here, sucker!” I retorted in English, the P227 sending two hollow point rounds into his chest and another right into his left eye socket. 

“Man down!” An English voice screamed, but before he could fire his gun, I was upon him, delivering a powerful blade-hand strike at the man’s throat and destroying his windpipe.

That was the last of them. 

I turned to woman, who was staring at me, her mouth hanging open.

“What kind of rebel are you?” She asked in disbelief. 

I shrugged. “One of a kind.”

That’s when I noticed the skull patch on her left shoulder. 

She’s one of them. 

I held out a hand. “Name’s Jock Bentley. You are?”

“You can call me Lilith,” She said.

Must be a callsign. 

“If you wanted to sue your parents for naming you, I think you’d have a case,” I said with a dry laugh. 

By this time, the woman was groaning in pain. However, she managed a smile over her own behind the mask. “Actually, my Uncle Sam gave it to me, we’re still on pretty good terms.”

Definitely a callsign.

1jjkkeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_beautifulmind8494/comments/1jjkkeq/coffee_capsule_filling_and_sealing_machines/,Coffee Capsule Filling and Sealing Machines: Enhancing Quality and Efficiency in Coffee Packaging,"Coffee capsule filling and sealing machines have become essential for coffee manufacturers looking to meet the growing demand for convenient, high-quality coffee products. These machines are designed to precisely fill and seal coffee capsules, ensuring consistency, freshness, and efficiency in production. With the rising popularity of single-serve coffee systems, investing in advanced filling and sealing technology has become a necessity for businesses seeking to remain competitive in the market. By automating the packaging process, coffee capsule machines improve product quality, reduce labor costs, and enhance production output.

# Precision and Efficiency in Coffee Capsule Filling

One of the most significant advantages of coffee capsule filling and sealing machines is their ability to provide precise and consistent filling. These machines use advanced dosing systems to measure the exact amount of coffee grounds per capsule, ensuring uniformity in taste and strength. High-speed automation enables manufacturers to produce thousands of capsules per hour, significantly increasing efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, modern machines integrate nitrogen flushing technology to preserve coffee freshness by reducing oxygen exposure, ultimately enhancing the product's shelf life and flavor retention. **Visit more:** [**Coffee capsule filling and sealing machine**](https://www.joygoalmachine.com/coffee-capsule-filling-and-sealing-machine.html)

# Versatility in Capsule Types and Customization

Coffee capsule filling and sealing machines offer versatility by accommodating various capsule types, including Nespresso-compatible, K-Cup, Lavazza, and Dolce Gusto formats. This adaptability allows manufacturers to cater to different consumer preferences and market demands. Many machines also support customized branding options, including printed lids and unique packaging designs, helping businesses establish a strong brand presence. By offering multiple capsule formats and customization features, manufacturers can expand their market reach and provide tailored solutions to coffee lovers worldwide.

# Maintaining Hygiene and Compliance Standards

Hygiene is a critical factor in coffee production, and coffee capsule filling and sealing machines are designed to meet stringent food safety regulations. These machines are typically constructed with stainless steel components that are easy to clean and resistant to contamination. Many models feature automated cleaning and sterilization systems that ensure a sanitary production process. Compliance with food industry standards such as FDA, CE, and GMP regulations ensures that the final product is safe for consumption. Investing in hygienic and compliant machinery helps businesses maintain consumer trust and avoid potential regulatory issues.

# Cost-Effectiveness and Sustainability in Coffee Packaging

While the initial investment in a coffee capsule filling and sealing machine can be significant, the long-term cost savings outweigh the expense. These machines reduce labor costs by automating the filling and sealing process, minimizing the need for manual intervention. Additionally, many modern machines are designed to optimize material usage, reducing waste and operational costs. Sustainability is another key consideration, with many manufacturers now producing compostable and recyclable coffee capsules.

For example (my current situation), if you came into a place and ordered a coffee in German, but now you have finished that and want something completely different. I know about how to ask for the same thing, or how to ordering from the menu when I first enter a place, but I'm not clear on what the proper way to ask for some addiitonal item would be. I would usually just go with ""eine... bitte"" which works fine but also usually causes staff to immediately switch to english so it's clearly sufficiently incorrect that it labels you as a tourist.",5,1742912624.0,German,7,1.0,False

\+$200 flight credit with Travel Bank

\+10,000 mile annual award ($120 value)

= +$20

And that doesn't even take into account any money saved from free bags. You don't have to use any of the extra perks (crap), and you come out on top. Am I missing something?

I live in Denver and am expecting my first child next month. Thinking about getting this card, given I'm going to be bringing at least one checked bag on every flight from now until eternity. Any advice would be appreciated. TIA.

1jjkegs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1jjkegs/i_think_i_have_very_low_dopamine_help/,I think i have very low dopamine. Help?,"Mid December i decided to quit weed, a week later i decided to quit alcohol and caffeine too. Shortly after i noticed some unpleasant things. At first i thought they were just withdrawal symptoms, and i believed that was the entire issue, but now that it has stabilised and i feel 0 cravings, i am starting to suspect there might be more to it.

My therapist has brought up the possibility of me having ADHD and suggested to pursue further testing.

What i noticed since quitting:

* ⁠Lots of anxiety/panic attacks 
* ⁠Absolutely no motivation to keep up hobbies i had
* Zero motivation at work 
* ⁠Fatigue, apathy, tiredness 
* Lower (almost no) libido 
* ⁠Lost interest in socialising

All of this is very unusual for me. Sure, i’ve always had bad days, sometimes i’d be anxious or be a bit sad. But ever since quitting i feel much worse mentally. I used to go out on the weekends, take long car trips just because i wanted to take some photos, i loved going out to restaurants even if alone. But now i just don’t feel the need to do any of that. I go to work, go to the gym, rot at home, go to bed. And repeat. I even lost any desire to play videogames, which is something i liked to do from time to time. 

This is extremely unusual for me, and i am looking on ways to “boost” my dopamine or at least bring it up a bit, because i feel like i’m just existing through the days waiting for motivation to come back.

Known deficiencies: 

* ⁠low Vitamin D: 14 ng/mL (ref range 30 - 100) •	⁠low folates: 2.20 ng/ml (ref range >4.60)

Supplements:

* ⁠Vitamin D (4000 IU/day); Folic acid 5mg/day, High dose vit B complex (B1, B6, B12), Mag glycinate.

Edit to add: I quit in order to become healthier, not because i had problems regulating myself. I'd smoke weed in the evening before bed (3/4 puffs) and on sunday morning (a bit more). As for alcohol, i was drinking to the point of being drunk once per month, tipsy twice per month. With the occasional beer here and there.

As for coffee, i never went over two small espresso cups (30 ml) of coffe, so only abput 100mg of caffeine at most. i do not believe i am suffering withdrawals, i believe i am struggling with the absence of dopamine.

This is my attempt at living completely sober, and it's not going great.

Edit2: i exercise, i go to the gym and do cardio. I eat well and have lost 40lbs since November, so at least i know it’s not food induced",7,1742912212.0,Supplements,57,0.77,False

I’d like to start honoring my campaign promises of transparency and accessibility *retroactively* (before I’m even elected) by keeping you all up to date on how things are progressing. Very soon, I’ll also begin hosting in-person meetings. At first, these gatherings will likely be small meet-ups in coffee shops, where we can strategize, discuss issues, and build community—while getting hopped up on delicious caffeinated beverages (if that’s your thing…).

I’ve made contact with a few local folks to begin formally organizing. Some are professional campaigners who, while amazing at what they do, unfortunately require a salary that my “radically unfunded” campaign just can’t support. Still, they’ve been incredibly generous, offering a ton of input and advice free of charge—and I’m very grateful for that. :)

I’m getting things in place to start taking my message to the streets. I plan to use my wife’s fancy, industrial-strength laser machine to create big signs that I’ll literally carry through the streets of every town in the 5th District. The goal is to get the word out and drive more people to the website to learn about this movement.

I’m currently trying to catch the attention of **Justice Democrats**, in hopes of gaining support from the same group that helped AOC and the rest of The Squad rise to their positions. Though I initially planned to run against Clark as an Independent, I would consider entering the Democratic primary if I had the backing of a strong progressive organization. I am—and have always been—a registered Democrat, though I’ve often fancied myself an Independent.
