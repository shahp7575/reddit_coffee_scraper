Making friends as a 27 year old dude isn't easy I'm finding out. These darned things called ""responsibilities"" or whatever keep getting in my way! 

I want friends that say the most unhinged, out of pocket stuff. I want memes and pictures of your dogs. 

You wanna rant about your work drama? Do it. I wanna hear it. 

I'm a big texter but I will match your energy. If you start jumping on a bed, my dumb self is going to jump with you. 

You got games on your pc? 🤔 

I am currently playing Enshrouded, Minecraft, REPO, Stray, Deep Rock Galactic, Black Ops 6. I have PC and PS5. 

If, by some miracle, I sound like someone you want to be friends with add me on discord. I'm terrible about messaging on reddit. 

My discord is LionFishBoy

**Apr 3     Here there be (Pseudo)Dragon**

“Hey boss, we got a lively bunch today.” Jim is at the counter with Lemar today.  I nod to both.

New day, new people, new “people.”  I look around, a lot of them I don’t recognize who or what they are.  After a while you can sort of get a vibe from them and guess.  Table 3 has at least 3 ladies from the “sexy women found in nature” subcategory.  Tight Green dress with brown leggings?  Dryad.  White and light blue dress with hair colored in every shade going from green to blue?  Probably a sylph.  It’s spring, and that nymph is barely wearing enough not to trigger legal issues.  Yikes.  *Also, DAMN.* 

The nymph turns and looks at me.  She smiles a little and then she winks.  *Why do nymphs get me distracted so easily?*  Fuck, I need to fix that train of thought. Okay, time to get my stuff stored and change so I can help.  

Coming back in after changing, I turn my attention to the man walking in.  Well, walking in is not the correct term here.  He “ducks?” in.  His shoulders are at the top of the door.  An 80-inch-tall door.  An 80-inch-tall door that is shoulder height to this being.  And on one of those shoulders is a pet lizard.  Even for New York City, this one is pushing the line. 

Two of the gals at table 3 gasp when they see him and walk over.  Both give a little bow and he nods in return.  Okay, so he is important.  The nymph and dryad are treating him like royalty but not the sylph.  So earth and probably summer royalty.  Oh boy.  Here he comes.

The Fae towers over me.  I am 6 feet tall.  I feel like a toddler for the first time in years.  “Thank you for visiting our establishment.  What would you like to order today?”  He smiles and nods. “Matcha Tea Latte, Venti.”  This tracks.  Then something I don’t expect happens and I am thrown for a loop.  The lizard pipes up.  “Dragon Drink, Tall.”  My brain registers the information and pure instinct puts the order in.  I realize the lizard has gossamer wings.   “Is that all?”  The lizard hops down and grabs a cookie.  I dutifully add it to the order.  It FLIES back up.  The gentleman looks sternly at it, and it apologizes.

“What should we call out to inform you that your order is ready, kind customers?”  I have no clue on the pseudo-dragon’s gender and do not want to offend a Fae, so neutral it is.

“Call for Em and Nate,” the tall one says.  I quickly go through notable Em names when something clicks.  “Emmantiensien?” I whisper to myself as I collect the gold coins he has presented.  I hear a chuckle.  Then I realize I am right and the dragon is “Nate … Nathair.”  Oh boy, TWO Summer Court members.  Hell, Nathair is a big name in the Spring Court from what I saw. 

A treant and pseudo-dragon.  They are just customers that need to have their needs met.  You got this Pat.  Both look at me and nod, “spot on” says Em with a wink.  Guess they can hear whispers even in a loud room.  Going to file that under important.  Em drops 2 gold coins in the tip jar.  From the sound I know they are not gold-plated dollars.  Big tipper.

John calls them this time.  They get their drinks and go sit down.  I see 2 very human tourists walk up and ask if they can take a selfie with M while his lizard is on his shoulder for Insta.  He obliges them.  *Did they just ask and receive a favor?  OH NO*.

He asks if he can get a picture with them for his insta.  They all post it.  *Wait, THAT was his favor*?

“***Of course, favors should be of similar value.  And we have rules for how we may interact with people at this establishment laid out by ALL court royalty.  I helped draft them. We are very much of a similar mindset when it comes to your rules.  No one, not even the Queens, may cause you harm through their action, or face the wrath of both courts***\*\*.”\*\* 

I guess I was broadcasting again.  I whisper “My thanks for the information, kind sage.”  He waves and they head out.

Lemar walks up.  “So, John and I saw the wings, did you?”  I smile. 

“Only when he got close enough, just before he used them.”  They both nod.  “Us too.”  I look at John.  “Okay, how you feeling about being the new hire now?”

John laughs.  “Boss lady, this is New York City.  Not including the crazy fairy tale creatures, I have seen a dozen weird things this week.  This morning, I saw a guy urinating on a passed out drunk who was still asleep while it was happening on my way in.  Nothing surprises me enough to worry.  I looked it up, this place hasn’t had a robbery in over a year, the rules you gave us work and are easy to follow once you know, and really, the pay is nice.  The tip jar… wow.  That first time we I got a solid gold coin,  an actual solid gold coin, I was like, holy fuck.  So yea.  I’m good.”

I laugh.  The pay has been getting better.  Since I set up a way to get those coins sold through a few different channels to avoid bad questions, things have been amazing.  Everyone’s pay is so much better. 

Speaking of, she’s in class all day today.  I will get home before her so I should make something nice for dinner.  That might be too much work.  Maybe take out?

My musing is interrupted by a wave from an irregular regular.  Her white skirt with petticoat, matching top and orange cap always gives me a smile.  I begin signing, “Hi, good lady.  The usual for the one we call May?”  I don’t know a lot of ASL, but I know how to say that.  She nods and claps and twirls away.  Lemar waves and begins signing to her.  She signs back.  I can’t keep track.  I am also very impressed because he learned it when she started coming in.  What some people do for love.   *Rule breaker.*  Her drink ready, he looks at me with an almost pleading need in his eyes.  I roll my eyes in response and laugh.  “Lemar, take a break.”  He literally jumps a little and pulls off his apron to go with her in the corner.

John walks up.  “They make a cute couple, even if it is against rule 3…”  I smile. 

“I have amended my ‘no dating the clients’ rule to ‘No dating unless the client is someone utterly devoid of malice.’ May counts.  I am pretty sure she can be trusted not to hurt him.  Hell, I think I saw May change her step to avoid stepping on an ant last week, so she’s okay.  Besides, he’d quit for her.  He’s a hell of a manager.  I really don’t want to lose him.  Yea, better to let them be like this and hope for the best.  He already knows corporate has a policy against PDAs on the grounds.” 

John laughs.  “So… Oberon…?”

I look John straight in the eyes.  “Remember devoid of malice in my amended rule?  Have you read or seen the Midsummer Night’s Dream?!”

“You can’t believe that a play is historical…” he is pressing X to doubt and I have receipts…

“I asked him a couple of weeks ago. He said it was close to accurate. He was ‘in a mood’ and such…”My air quotes make John laugh.

John presses on, “He has mellowed a lot though. Means you can try to climb Mount Oberon.”

“I’d die in the attempt, like so many at Everest” my voice is deadpan

He sees I am not kidding in this belief.  “Yea, probably.  Besides, there’s that mortal that has your eye more anyway.”

My confusion must be evident.  He looks at me and gasps.  “Seriously?  Wow.  I thought that was just a river in Egypt.”

“What the fuck are you talking about?”  I am not sure I want to know.

The door chime interrupts our attention and my best friend and current roommate Jackie walks in.  She’s wearing the warm coat she likes even in the Spring and her hip hugging jeans.  She decided on the blue cap today, and her red hair is bouncy and full of life.  She got up early to get it like that.  That girl is all sorts of dedicated to looking amazing.  I can’t help but smile.  Girl had to be putting on a show for someone in class.

“Hey babe, what’s up?”  She smiles as she walks up.  Ugh, infuriating.  I am at work and she is my roommate and employee.  She can’t just go saying that here.

“Ms. Jackie, I will remind you that this is both our place of employ and it is inappropriate to call me babe.”  I smile sweetly.  It is my down to business voice.  She knows I am serious.  Her look turns mischievous.  Uh-oh.

“Ms. Pat.  I will remind you my next shift is tomorrow, I am stopping by between classes for coffee as a client, and you are a total fucking babe that looks even better just out of the shower.”

…

…

*Why is she all but leering at me?  Why am I so embarrassed she said this in the shop?  More importantly, why isn't my brain working?  Why are my cheeks on fire?  She embarrassed me in public and this is how I react?  Calm, Patricia.  Calm.  She’s trying to mess with you*.  *Come on Patricia, get a good comeback!  You got this girl!!!*

“Ms. Jackie.  I…  crap, I don’t have any sort of comeback here.  Please excuse me.”  *I absolutely do not have this!*

As I walk to the back room, trying to hide my embarrassment, I somehow hear John whisper from at least 40 feet away in a noisy shop full of other conversations, “Really?  You broke the boss, you asshole.  She can barely handle you on a good day and you say that?!”

“She’s a tough girl.  There’s a reason I love her.”

Why can I hear whispers from across the room now?  *AND WHY AM I EVEN MORE WARM*?!

The Dryad that is here often laughs as I pass her.  I somehow manage to smile at her as she gets more tea.  “Hey, Connifer, just another day in New York…”  Oh sure, now I can manage to think of something...

“Call me Connie, Pat.”

I need a distraction.  “Connie, why are you here so often and in every season?”  She winks at me.  “My tree is on the corner of this lot.  This place is as much home as my tree is now.”

I know how she feels. It is my home as well.  Except when I am being driven out by embarrassment...",1,1741356052.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1j5ohok,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1j5ohok/what_do_you_do_if_you_dont_like_it/,What do you do if you don't like it?,"Let me say upfront, I like this subreddit and lurk on here almost every day.  With that in mind, I'm going to try my best to color within the lines of Rule 6.



  
Just a comment about me so you know where I'm coming from.  I joined the Army during the Reagan administration (delayed entry) and I retired last year.  I had a career of active/reserve/guard with mobilizations thrown in.  I also retired last year from the US Department of State.  There have been things from both political parties over the years that I didn't like.  One consistent example has been - no money from 1 October until sometime in August and then it's, oh shit, we have millions to spend before 30 Sep.  I digress.



  
This morning over coffee I read the post from **IlikeFOODmeLikeFOOD** and I read most of the comments.  It really got me thinking, What do you do if you don't like it?  What if you don't like the way things are going?  Again, trying to stay apolitical, and not naming administrations, there were some things that came up with the DoD, VA, and Federal government employees at one time or another that I didn't like.  I called and emailed my Senators and Congressman.  I also called and emailed the White House public comment line.  I called and emailed the American Legion, the VFW, the DAV, and the ROA.  I'm a life member of these groups and I encourage you to join.  I also voted.



If these groups (AL, VFW, DAV, and others) are testifying before Congress and they say they are speaking on behalf of 10 million vets and not 1 million vets, their voice carries more weight.  I have read all the comments about these organizations not being so welcoming to the recent vets.  I also read a few who said when the new blood gets in, things change.  I'm not here to debate that.  I feel that these groups and a few others, MOAA and AUSA looking at you, and others, generally do a good job of speaking for things that are important to us all.  Do they get it right every time, no.  

  
This leaves me with my question, what do you do if you don't like it?  If you don't like the way an administration or Congress is doing something, what else can you do to have your voice heard?  

  
Remember Howard Beale from the movie Network (1976)?  Of course you don't.  But you do remember one of his lines -  I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!

  
From the movie released in 1976 (this could be plugged in many times during our country's history):  ""I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad - worse than bad. They're crazy. It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, 'Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.' Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot - I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you've got to get mad. You've got to say, 'I'm a HUMAN BEING, God damn it! My life has VALUE!' So I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell, 'I'M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!'""



So, what else can you do if you are mad as hell and you're not going to take it anymore?  Peace out brothers and sisters. ",6,1741355988.0,army,2,0.8,False

1j5odpe,https://i.redd.it/1ttr7tvlw9ne1.jpeg,New Tiki Book Out - Tiki Paradise,"Hello Tiki family. Some of my friends know what I’ve been working on the last six months but I wanted to let everybody else know that I have just finished a new book called Tiki Paradise. It has been published and it is on sale now at Barnes & Noble (BN.com).

I believe you will find this book an exciting addition to your Tiki library. We needed a guide that fills the gaps between the history of Tiki, other people’s tiki bars, and the cocktail recipes.

Tiki Paradise helps you to create your own tiki escape, but more importantly, how important the community and the shared experiences are. 

Come join me on Saturday March 29 at Louisiana TikiFest (LATikifest.com) where I will be one of the seminar speakers. I’ll have a couple dozen copies on hand for sale and signing. You may also buy them today at Barnes & Noble (BN.com) by just entering “Tiki Paradise” in the search bar and they will get it out to you. 

I hope you enjoy the book as much as I enjoyed writing it, and I hope it finds a place on your shelf or coffee table along with the other classics.

Also available at TikiParadiseBook.com

LA TikiFest is in its 3rd year. Friday, Sunday, and the TikiFest Lamp workshop are sold out but there are tickets available for Saturday.",11,1741355728.0,Tiki,1,1.0,False
1j5o8uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1j5o8uu/i_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_of_almost_four/,I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years and I regret it,"It's almost been a year, and I made a mistake.In June I broke up with my girlfriend of almost four years because we were going away for college and we were both going out of state on opposite  sides of the country. I thought it would be the best thing for us, but it's been the opposite.

I really hurt her when we broke up. The first few days I thought this was going to be the best thing for me, and I just tried to push her out of my mind as much as I could, but I just kept feeling like an asshole. She loved me so much, and I took it for granted. She would do things for me all the time just because and never expect anything in return. She would constantly put me ahead of her and also just loved me no matter what I was going through.

I couldn't stop thinking about her, and during my first week of college, I was so excited about what was going on in my life, and I wanted nothing more than to just text her and let her know what was going on.

It bothered me that in the almost 3 months we had been broken up at that point, she never once reached out to me. I wanted to know how college was going for her; I wanted to know how she was doing. How could the girl who I once had this amazing love with not try to reach out to me once? I texted her, letting her know that I had been thinking about her and that I hoped she was doing well. She kept things super brief and said she hoped I was doing well, but I wanted to talk to her so much more, so I poked about what she had been doing, and in two months she had done so much, and she was going to this great huge school and was doing all of this without me.

I know I should've been happy for her, but it just made me sad and angry. We didn't talk for a month after that until she sent me a picture of a tattoo she had gotten. I was so excited that she finally reached out to me. This was the first time since we had broken up that she initiated the conversation.

We talked for a little bit, and it felt so great. We fell back into conversation like back when we were dating. It felt so good to talk to her again, but at the same time, it made me feel sick that I knew so little about what was going on in her life now, and I was only hearing so little about it. I sent her a text telling her how happy I was for her and how what she's doing seems like such a great experience for her, and she never responded. That hurt a lot.

I looked at her TikTok and Instagram for the first time in months, and I just wanted to throw up. She is living this whole life without me. She looks happy and, most of all, beautiful. Like, how dare she be so beautiful and smile at people with smiles that were once mine?  I would go to her Spotify, and I would be so paranoid that one of those playlists was dedicated to someone that wasn't me.

I felt so selfish and angry and mad at the world and at myself. I had to push her out of my mind, so I started seeing someone. I wasn't even really interested in them. Looks-wise, they were nothing compared to my ex-girlfriend. Their personality was so dull and boring compared to my ex, and in the end, I ended up just feeling like this huge dick for stringing someone along for months just to get over my ex-girlfriend.

I went home for my Christmas break from my college, and it got even worse. Knowing that we were in the same town and just a drive away from each other's houses made me feel insane. I got so nervous that I was going to run into her any time I left the house. I thought about going Christmas shopping in the mall she worked at so I could ""accidentally run into her"" and then would just get sad because I was becoming this huge creep. I wanted to text her every day asking if she wanted to get coffee, and I never did because nothing would hurt more than knowing she didn't want to see me. I texted her Merry Christmas, and she was nice about it, but she didn't want to talk to me anymore after that.

And then I saw she went back to her college before me, and it was painful seeing her with all her friends having so much fun and having so much fun without me. Seeing her cozied up with a girl on her Instagram makes me feel like I'm going to throw up. I see them post together all the time, and I just want to know if they're dating. How could she date someone so soon after 3, almost 4 years? How could she be so brazen and post her and that girl getting coffee and going on dates together? Does she not think I'll see it? I think I would feel worse if it was a man. The thought of some man looking at her the way I used to and touching her and being intimate with her makes me angry and sad and violent all at the same time.

I would stalk her pages all day while I was still in our hometown, waiting for her to post something and getting nervous when she would. How could she be having so much fun and be so happy all without me?  We were each other's first love, first kiss, first everything. And now I don't know if she's doing that with other people.

Things got a little bit better when I went back for my second semester of college, but I still just can't get her out of my mind. I'm starting to see another girl now to try and get over my ex, and she's, again, nothing like my ex-girlfriend, and I don't think there will ever be anyone like her.When I first broke up with her, I didn't think it would hurt this much. I guess in the back of my mind I thought she would've fought for us. I thought she would've texted me more when we were broken up; I thought she and I honestly would've gotten back together at this point. I'm so insanely in love with her still, and I brought this on myself, but I thought I was doing what's best for the both of us. I guess I didn't appreciate or realize the things that she did for me while we were together.",2,1741355408.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

I suffer from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and honestly, it’s ruining my life. I’m totally against antidepressants, but I had to start taking them just to try and manage this nightmare. Yet, every month before my period, it’s the same story…

Three days before, I turn into a dragon. I’m incredibly harsh with my kids and my husband, and they all know that Mom is not herself during those days. The guilt eats me alive afterward. It feels like I completely lose control over my emotions.

I’ve tried cutting down on coffee (I went from 5 cups a day to just 1 in the morning), I watch my diet, I stay on my meds… but no matter what, those days feel like a ticking time bomb.

This happens every so often, and eventually the feeling goes away. Since finishing college, over 10 years ago now, I’ve found a lot of friendships I made have gradually faded, and as I get older I find it hard to make connections. I would love a friend, I would love someone to just grab coffee with. 

Fortunately, I have my husband, we’ve been married for 3 years, but it seems like he’s now become my *everything*. We’re “attached at the hip”, which I don’t think is a bad thing but because I don’t exactly have anyone else to turn to, he’s kind of all I have.

I had a huge falling out with my family a few years ago. My household growing up was chaotic, both of my parents were abusive, and trying to address it with my parents and my sister was met with resistance. So I’m one of those millennials who’ve gone “no contact” with their family. To put the cherry on top, my husband and I are having issues with his family too. 

I feel like I’m the common denominator in all of this, and that it’s 200% my fault for why I’m here. I grew up being bullied at school, and at home, so it’s been hard to trust the world and trust people. I’m extremely aware of how I act and what I say when I talk to other people — and I definitely feel awkward, and unnatural.

Good morning all! I hope everyone is doing well and getting through the work day! I’m here enjoying my second (maybe third?) cup of coffee and would love some company. Join me and let’s be friends or soulmates or whatever we become!

A little about me. I’m a tall, glasses wearing brown haired guy working in the legal field, though I don’t get into any courtroom dramatics. My username here comes from my cinematic hero and all around icon Elle Woods. I enjoy my job, which is mostly research and writing, but I think some people might think it’s boring.

In my spare time, I really enjoy reading and enjoying nature. I’m always up for a book recommendation or a good hike. I love to bake as well, though I’m definitely not ready for the tent yet. I just enjoy trying to make tasty things to give to friends and family. I play board games and D&D when I can. I like to write fiction. I’m too big a LotR nerd. I speak two languages with various degrees of “this would offend a native speaker,” guess what they are! (One might be more obvious!)

1j5o0h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/1j5o0h6/is_burning_man_burning_out_online/,Is Burning Man Burning Out Online?,"Burning Man used to be a portal to enlightenment, love, healing, adventure, transformation (meaning alignment with light and removing that which wasn't aligned), art, play, theater, music, energy work, yoga, tantra, ritual, cultish fun, massages, drinks, spliffs, psychedelics, ecstacy, killing ones shadow, meeting new people, making love, dancing and coffee. 

Online it's like we have a bunch of people curious and a large amount of mental health patients screaming for heal through their behavior not seeing themselves call the polished copper kettle black.

At the burn we would be the medicine, help our fellow burner walk to shaman dome, join them in a yoga class, entice them into Qigong, treat them to a drum circle, introduce them to an elder or someone whose a healer or find something better. We also did that online, showing love to whoevers shadow was showing up to place light on it to dispel it or exercise their demon to death. 

Now I just see toxic behavior begetting toxic behavior and the burn is right now at the forefront of that toxic behavior and not and the forefront of clearing it out.  Where are the lovers?  The Truth speakers sharing their Kabbalistic mastery of wisdom?  The ignitors that burn away the humdrum of what is popular in society so we can stay with the light and love the night away?

I pray for more insightful dialog about what life is really about!  I scream, I love you in the face of most of what you say online means nothing to anyone and dream of the day AI washes it all away ❤️. I call for the bonfires to be lit and strangers who are diametrically opposed but with unified hearts to wax poetic about the future we get to play in knowing full well love is everywhere and whimsy is right around the corner of this moment of now.

Can someone show off some new dance moves?  Where are the new musicians sharing the height of the underground?  House heads unite knowing they never leave home!  Spare a bit of plays to get over your ego and say I love you online to all things and realize that's all that will matter when you die?  And remember, you die, this ends, be eternal and work back from the end of your temporal state - it's the path you know, the only way to stay in heaven once you've realized you never left and it's just your body that's got to come to terms with that element of earth, born from the flow of now at the begining of beginnings.  If you've forgotten, stretch, rise up your Kundalini, increase your vibration, get over yourself, be Buddha's take on Lao Tzu as you live Christ and don't forget your bride. 

If you wasted one iota of time nor bringing more pleasure to the world, more expansion, more sun rise and day light, call out your sinful way, pray for forgiveness then compliment a stranger or better yet your enemy.  Send them love and see where they are good and get back to your art car and ride!

See you in the orgy dome, you lovers of life, you poly pan plural people of playa who play personally inside, outside and with each other in the myriad forms a feeling flesh. 

Bless you at your wedding, may you and your partner be forever and a day until time takes your form away and you decide if you want to come here and heaven up the place again.

Never forget where you came from, where you return and what you always are - dust.  Now go find some new wood, the mold and mildew and stench of stagnant now is growing and we have a strong wind coming lifting us up like Elijah.  The archetypes of the patriarchs and matriarchs are in the bed chamber getting it on and you're alone out here feeling ill.  Luckily the panacea was sent to you long ago, the cure for learning how to human again after transforming into that oneness of onesness.  Set that log or moment you might even move to do something less than love on fire and dance to the moon.  

The Internet is old, let your psychic centers awaken, speak with the union of God and humanity and stretch, vibe and wiggle. Remember that the child inside is innocent but we all know what you've done when facing the face of the Devil and we won't let you falter in killing it with us, slay as they say.  Accountability is you and thus it is All when held like your flaming sword of truth and rightousness.  Do not cease until every demon is dead, start with the head, ""it's inside"" I said!  

And love, love, love

It's time you pull out the moop of who you behaved as when you were less than union with form and that which is beyond and burn, burn, burn a newer and bluer fire and while you're at it don't forget to toss in your miserable words, your pointless finger movements and your futile attempt to matter to those who aren't love themselves as that tends to burn the brightest.

1j5nzrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1j5nzrz/i_need_to_vent_incoming_a_very_long_rant/,I need to vent (Incoming a very long rant),"When I was a child, I did great in my classes without having to study much, even when I didn't pay attention in class. I rarely paid attention, and when I did, it was only in subjects that I was deeply interested in. I was a restless kid who always daydreamed in class, except for the subjects that I was actually interested in.

The thoughts in my head are never silent. It was never a problem for me. I was always a kid with a huge imagination (now I am an adult with a huge imagination). I was also a restless kid. For the normal eyes, it looked like I stayed still, but if they paid closer attention to me, they would notice that I would either be fidgeting with my pencil or playing with my loose curl. It was never a problem for me, until it was.

Studying subjects I was not interested on my own became very difficult for me. I physically couldn't bring myself to do it, no matter how I tried. No matter how much I told myself, ""I'll get it done, I'll get it done"", I just couldn't do it until the very last moment. People around me called me lazy, I called myself lazy, and no matter how much I tried to change, I couldn't do it. When it came to subjects I liked, however, my parents had to physically remind me that the subject was done for the day and that it was time to move on to the next subject. It was hell.

And then, finally, at ninth grade, I was diagnosed with ADHD. And before you say that I must have lied to my doctor about the symptoms, my parents also had to answer questions about my behavior that they had observed. Anyways, things finally started making sense to me. And I thought that I would finally get the help that I needed.

.

.

.

SIKE! THIS IS NEPAL! WHY THE FUCK DID I EVER THINK THAT I WOULD GET HELP FOR A CONDITION THAT EVEN A LOT OF PSYCHOLOGISTS IN NEPAL HAVE A MISCONCEPTION ABOUT, LET ALONE THE NEPAL GOVERNMENT!

Sorry, I needed to let my anger out. Why am I angry?

Well, a lot of treatment for ADHD is not available in Nepal, and the medicine that is given to people with ADHD is banned.

BANNED.

Now, I get it. Those drugs are very addictive to those without ADHD and is very dangerous in the wrong hands.

BUT IT IS STILL FRUSTRATING NONETHELESS!

Needless to say, I needed to improvise. And improvise I did.

You see, during my SEE, I started to study by chewing gum while studying and playing music in the background. In fact, I went a bit further.

So, I decided that I would study HARD by writing answers to the questions down while reading them out. That wasn't the part that motivated me to study though.

You know gel pens? Of course you do. Anyways, rather than throwing them out after running out of ink, I decided to collect their ink chamber and join them together.

Honestly, that was the best idea I ever came up with to make me study because it worked.

*It fucking worked.*

So, now that that problem was dealt with, I never struggled with dealing with my ADHD again.

.

.

.

SIKE AGAIN! YOU THOUGHT THAT DEALING WITH ADHD WAS EASY?! IF YOU DID, YOU THOUGHT WRONG!

You know how I said that the thoughts in my head are never silent. By that, I meant that they are ***never*** silent, like ever. EVEN WHEN I AM TRYING TO SLEEP!

DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY NIGHTS I'VE SPENT SLEEPLESS BECAUSE MY BRAIN COULDN'T STFU?! COUNTLESS! IT'S HELL UP HERE, AND BY HERE, I MEAN MY OWN HEAD.

You know that meme on TikTok that goes, ""Wtf is this kid doing?"" and the kid goes, ""THE VOICES!""?

Yeah, I'm that kid.

Because the thoughts in my head is never silent, I used to talk to my sister as I went to sleep because we used to share the bed. But, after she moved out, it started getting difficult. Because of that, I have to rely on sleep aids to fall asleep. And it works most of the days. But sometimes, things get really bad, and the sleep aids don't work.

What do I do then?

I chug a cup of coffee and hope that I don't get an anxiety attack. And while hoping to not get an anxiety attack, I start getting anxious and I cry and I get an anxiety attack.

Yeah... That's how my body seems to react to even a little bit of caffeine. Even the smallest dosage of caffeine increases my adrenaline and makes my body go haywire, as if I am being chased by a predator.

So yeah, it's a sucky situation overall. I fucking hate it, and I hate that even though the people around me knows that I have the condition, they don't know how bad it can get. They still think that I am not trying hard enough, that I am just lazy and using my ADHD as an excuse, and that I am just procrastinating.

But, I am trying! I am trying my hardest to not let this affect my day to day life! I am trying to not let my thoughts run wild! I am trying my best to cope with this!

BUT IT GETS SO FUCKING BAD SOMETIMES!

I know that most people didn't read till the end, and for those who did, thank you very much. It was a very long rant. I just had to let it all out. I am using this post both as a vent post and as a writing exercise. I feel so much better typing all of this out.

Idk if there are people who relate to me here. But, if there are, I need one billion dollars for giving you ideas to cope if you didn't have them already.

1j5nz77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1j5nz77/how_i_make_it_work/,How I Make it Work,"You do you. Let's get that straight. But lately lots of post of how do I even do this?

I agree when I had a young tot who needed things in the night I wasn't able to get up so early. 

I also do not have depression and I am sympathetic to that feeling of lethargy.

Ok so no witch hunt.

I work around 45 hours a week doing fairly complex stuff. So I'm in bed early because I'm tired and mentally overstimulated. 
I also believe firmly in filling my own cup and never taking it to zero. 

It's 5:15am. I've been up since about 4:30 so I could shower and get hot water and my son will plenty at 5:45.


I've flipped the laundry load I put in last night so it's drying. It's clear downstairs and no one can hear it here or anywhere else.
I'm going to get the washer going again when people are up. Two loads per day. 

5:45am I quietly cheerleader my son into the bathroom for his daily full shower.

I've got grab and go breakfast things and everyone is responsible for figuring it out. If someone is having a tough morning I'll put an English muffin in the toaster or suggest an overnight oats.

I make to-go coffee with lids for me and HS guy.

Son needs to do some personal care, teeth, backpack, shoes and he's got one hour for this and walks to the bus stop. 

Daughter is up by 6:10. She's doing face and coming down for clothes and breakfast and she can watch something.

I'm packing lunch for myself and daughter and running back up to do my teeth, my face and finishing with whatever my work top and any layers I'm wearing.

Nicely yelling a warning that we're doing shoes. 

I have an extra set of toothbrushes and toothpaste downstairs in the powder room in case we're running.

Now daughter and I leave and it's about 7am. I am going up one big street to drop her at before school care at her school. 

Now I'm pre rush time and do the 12 minutes to work and listen to NPR that's my only news of the day and all I can handle. 

Work, work, work, whatever is needed. Eat my lunch. Work work work. Till as late at 5:30.

Go back. If needed get daughter and go home and sort out my mental exhaustion and feeding people and what's for homework and wind down.

I could have ordered Amazon or a local drive up pickup at any point. 

I don't always work till 5:30 pm. Today it's going to be 3pm because I've done so much already.

I usually only get groceries on the weekend. And I we go to the gym on Saturday and Sunday each week as daughter and self. 

We do plenty of necessary errands on weekends 

Some version of that. Son is decent about doing dishes in the afternoon if needed, taking out the trash and a little vacuuming. Best husband ever. Joking. But I'm not sending a probably to someone else's house in the future.

1j5nvqg,https://i.redd.it/w5vtci94t9ne1.jpeg,10 day dirty fast in the books!,"SW: 236
CW: 217

My “dirty fast” daily guidelines were:
- Cream in my coffee (~40cal)
- One kombucha drink daily (~70cal)
- Light broth as needed (??cal)

Used lo-salt and table salt throughout for electrolytes, which worked like a charm. No headache, no light-headedness. 

Extremely proud! This is my third week-or-longer fast this year. I know I’ll gain ~5-7lbs back in water weight in coming days, but I’m down around 25lbs from where I began after new years.

The hardest part was the chill in my hands and feet after day 4 or so. On a cold winter day, it becomes a bone-deep chill that’s very hard to shake. I would go to sleep all dressed and layered, and it was still so cold!

Broke my fast with sausage and an omelet. Really no GI concerns at all so long as you never forget the first (or is it the second?) rule of fasting 🙂.

I still talk to her bf but once in two months or three..

So now back to story I saw her and I fcking yelled ANGRY BIRD IDHAR AA.. i was on call that time with my homie and I talked him to shit up for one minute and we started chatting but she was leaning her body backwards like i was harassing her or something.. she was doing introverts dance step.. she eventually got comfortable and had few chat but after one or two minutes she fcking left in mid Convo.. why I don't know it's been 5 years I did all that bullshit in 8th class.. does she still remember??

he confided in me at the start of the relationship that he was struggling with his mental health, to which i told him i’d always listen and then he never mentioned it again, so i figured it’d gone away. 

it’s a struggle to get him to talk to me, so i doubt he’d talk about his mental health with me. he just wakes up and goes on his xbox. 

the other week he upset me by saying he doesn’t like doing favours for me (getting me water, making me a coffee or bring me a paracetamol) and wishes i’d stop asking. he doesn’t cook, he doesn’t work, he doesn’t clean, he doesn’t have to do anything, and even when i ask he doesn’t so he’s not burnt out at home. 

i’ve been struggling with my mental health so badly and the constant stress of feeling so unloved is making things so much worse.

Hi, 

I am 34, male, from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 

My interests and hobbies include (but are not limited to): playing sports (badminton, squash, table tennis etc); fitness/gym; watching movies 
(my favourite film genre is horror movies); reading; socialising; going out for coffees; going out for dinner; going to pubs and clubs; learning about new languages and cultures; cooking; playing pool, and bowling; travelling and sightseeing; gaming etc. 

If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same thing, or feels they may share some of the same interests or values as me, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and chat and connect.

We have been trying for 7 months. I have received a PCOS diagnosis in the process of starting to try and didn’t get AF for 3 months. At the beginning of trying, my husband I decided we didn’t want to broadcast it to all our friends and family and wanted to remain more private with our TTC journey. After we hit the 6 month mark and I had been diagnosed, I started to open up to my family (my Mom, really) just to have someone to talk to other than my husband about. 

Last weekend, I saw my Mom and she was asking if I had spoken to our family friend about all of what was going on. She and I have known each other since we were toddlers, our Moms are friends (closer than we are) and she is on her second child. She keeps up to date with me every few months but we are not close. Therefore, not someone who I would confide in about our TTC journey. I told my Mom that I had not told her anything and she said that it was weird because this girl’s Mom had coffee with my Mom and expressed her apologies about “my infertility issues”. To clarify, I am NOT infertile, I have PCOS. We have been trying but haven’t even ovulated in three months. Regardless, this is none of her business nor is the information correct. 

My Mom was taken aback and asked her what she meant and this Mom said that her daughter (my friend) had told her that my husband and I are trying and it’s not working. She said I was depressed and really struggling with infertility. False, false, false. I told my Mom that all of this was untrue and that I had even spoken to her in four months?? 

Is this super weird? I’m not close enough to her to confront her about this. But now, I’m in my head thinking that all these people are thinking the same thing and jumping to the same conclusions that I am infertile just because we got married last year and aren’t pregnant yet.

The joke chapter of Gyro pretending to make coffee with his hair is funny and random and I can't wait to see it animated, maybe as a post-credits scene.

The structure of this volume is interesting: we have a little bit of Johnny and Gyro ---> Wekapipo vs Magent Magent ----> a huge moment between Lucy and Funny Valentine ---> Wekapipo vs Magent Magent (continued) ----> a little bit of Johnny and Gyro. It's built like a sandwich. Wekapipo is beginning to be more interesting but the real star of this volume is Lucy and Funny Valentine. My favorite panel (on slide 2) is Lucy trying to distract Funny Valentine from the right eyeball that just dropped onto the ground. Literally a Hitchcock scene, something that could come out of an early Hitchcock film. Beat after beat, this became one of the most impressively tense scenes of the entire series yet. From the iconic napkin monologue to Funny Valentine literally fucking dying.

I didn't expect Lucy to actually successfully stab Funny Valentine to death successfully. I love that Araki is proving to us that Funny Valentine is vulnerable too, similar to how he showed us how Pucci is vulnerable during the earlier parts of Stone Ocean. But then we have Funny Valentine reviving himself from the back of a chair, which is such an insane moment I can't wait to see it animated. Lucy discovering the assembled holy corpse is confusing but also somewhat horrifying. It makes no sense that Jesus' skull is somehow inside of Lucy's womb now but it's cool af as a concept. And the way Funny Valentine likes her even more after her revelation adds so much more to his character. It truly feels like we're entering the endgame now.",3,1741353027.0,StardustCrusaders,0,1.0,False

1j5n5bm,https://v.redd.it/sy5o8k9rn9ne1,What Topics Can You Talk About with Anyone?,"Effortless and Safe Topics to Connect with Anyone

Having a list of universal conversation topics can be a lifesaver when meeting someone new or trying to build rapport. Whether you're at a networking event, chatting with a stranger, or breaking the ice on a first date, knowing what to say next can prevent that dreaded awkward silence.

This post explores approachable, evergreen topics that can spark conversations with anyone, regardless of their background, interests, or personality. Plus, I’ll sprinkle in some unexpected conversation starters and science-backed insights on why these topics work.

1. The Weather: A Timeless Classic (With a Twist)
Yes, it’s cliché, but there’s a reason people default to talking about the weather—it’s instantly relatable and risk-free.

📌 Try These Instead of the Usual ""Nice Weather Today"" Approach:
✅ “January feels like it’s been six months long. Do you think we skipped February?”
✅ “Would you rather live where it’s always summer or always winter?”

💡 Why It Works: Familiar experiences create instant connection and lower social anxiety for both parties.

2. Food: A Universal Love Language
Food is one of the easiest topics to bond over because everyone eats—and most people love talking about their favorite meals.

📌 Conversation Starters:
✅ “What’s a food from your childhood that you still love?”
✅ “If you could only eat one cuisine for the rest of your life, what would it be?”
✅ “What’s the weirdest food combination you swear by?”

💡 Why It Works: Studies show that food-related conversations trigger positive emotions and nostalgia, making them a natural way to build rapport.

3. Travel and Dream Destinations
Almost everyone has a favorite place they’ve visited or a dream destination they’d love to explore.

📌 Great Ways to Ask About Travel:
✅ “What’s a place you’ve traveled to that surprised you?”
✅ “If you could live in any city for a year, where would it be?”
✅ “Do you prefer vacations that are relaxing or adventurous?”

💡 Why It Works: Travel sparks storytelling and often reveals personal values, making it a rich topic for deeper conversations.

4. Entertainment: Movies, TV Shows, and Books
Pop culture is an instant connector because it gives people common ground to discuss.

📌 Conversation Starters:
✅ “Have you watched anything recently that you’d actually recommend?”
✅ “Are you more into TV shows you can binge or movies you can’t stop thinking about?”
✅ “What’s a book you read that changed the way you think?”

💡 Why It Works: Shared entertainment bridges generational gaps and helps identify common interests quickly.

5. Hobbies and Interests
People light up when talking about what they enjoy—so ask about it!

📌 How to Get Them Talking:
✅ “What’s something you do for fun that most people wouldn’t guess about you?”
✅ “If you had an extra hour every day, what hobby would you start?”
✅ “Have you picked up any new hobbies recently?”

💡 Why It Works: Talking about hobbies creates positive emotions and allows authentic self-expression.

6. Current Events (Non-Controversial Only!)
Current events make for engaging conversations, but avoid divisive topics like politics or religion. Instead, focus on:

📌 Safe Current Events Topics:
✅ Tech Innovations – “Have you seen the latest AI tool that writes emails for you?”
✅ Sports & Major Events – “Did you catch that insane play in the last game?”
✅ Local Happenings – “Have you checked out the new coffee shop downtown?”

💡 Why It Works: Psychologists say that shared experiences (like major news or events) create a sense of connection and belonging.

7. Humor & Quirky Observations
Laughter is the fastest way to break the ice. A well-placed funny observation makes you instantly more relatable.

📌 Try These Fun Conversation Openers:
✅ “Why does every city have a coffee shop called ‘The Daily Grind’? Is it a rule?”
✅ “What’s the most bizarre thing you’ve seen today?”
✅ “I read that humans share 60% of their DNA with bananas. Do you feel personally offended by that?”

💡 Why It Works: Humor activates the brain’s reward system, making interactions more enjoyable and memorable.

8. Pets & Animals
Even if someone doesn’t own a pet, most people love talking about animals.

📌 Great Ways to Ask About Pets:
✅ “Are you a dog person, cat person, or ‘I want a pet tiger’ person?”
✅ “If you could have any exotic animal as a pet (without consequences), what would it be?”
✅ “What’s the funniest thing an animal has done in front of you?”

💡 Why It Works: Pet-related conversations trigger positive emotions and make people more comfortable.

9. Shared Experiences
If you’re at an event, in a class, or in a specific location, talk about what’s happening around you.

📌 Easy Icebreakers in Shared Settings:
✅ “This is such a cool venue—have you been here before?”
✅ “That last speaker was hilarious. What did you think?”
✅ “I feel like everyone here secretly agrees that free food is the best part of this event.”

💡 Why It Works: Discussing shared experiences creates an instant connection because you’re both in the same moment.

10. Gratitude & Positivity
People enjoy conversations that leave them feeling good. Asking about positive experiences encourages uplifting discussions.

📌 Positive Conversation Starters:
✅ “What’s something good that happened to you recently?”
✅ “What’s something you’re really excited about right now?”
✅ “What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?”

💡 Why It Works: Positive conversations trigger dopamine release, making interactions more enjoyable and memorable.

Final Thoughts: The Secret to Great Conversations
The key to talking with anyone isn’t just about having the right topics—it’s about:
✔ Being genuinely curious
✔ Asking open-ended questions
✔ Truly listening to their responses

People remember how you make them feel, so make them feel heard, valued, and engaged.

Embrace the Robot Revolution!,"It seems that AI is no longer satisfied with just dabbling in analytics and automation; it's now targeting your startup dreams, and in some cases, livelihoods. Welcome to the new frontier of AI's unabashed corporate takeover. If the figures don't shock you yet, here's a headline: AI-driven companies are reportedly set to outpace human-run startups in growth by 40% by the end of 2025. Yes, you read that right—it might be time to re-evaluate your business plan.

**Tech Tools vs. Tech Tyrants**

**1. AI's Main Offense: Efficiency to the Extreme**
Major anxiety-inducing truth bomb—AI doesn't eat, sleep, or take coffee breaks, and it's damn good at mimicking human cognitive functions. Startups relying on human intelligence alone face an uphill battle if they aren't integrating AI to streamline processes.

**2. The AI Arms Race**
Here's a fun one: Are you ready for the arms race where chips are the new currency? Giants like Nvidia, Broadcom, and TSMC are arming economies with AI processing power. It's the Silicon rush, but for AI—and if your startup isn’t equipped with this tech-tinted superpower, it might be time to rethink your strategy.

**3. AI's Strategic Play: Diverse Applications**
AI's capacity to be a jack-of-all-trades while excelling as a master of many is its secret sauce. Startups across every sector—from healthcare to real estate—are feeling the pressure to innovate or get left behind. 

**The Big Question**

AI isn't coming—it's already here, flipping industries on their heads. Founders, are your strategies flexible and forward-thinking enough to pivot in this new AI-dominated landscape?

Becky’s morning started like it always did—by being rudely awakened at 5 AM by the piercing yelps of her “precious fur baby,” Meatball. Never mind that she had an alarm set for 7 AM. Never mind that she had gone to bed at midnight. Meatball, a 90-pound pit bull with the energy of a caffeinated toddler, needed his morning enrichment, and that took priority over her own basic human needs.

Bleary-eyed, she dragged herself out of bed, stepping over chewed-up socks and the remains of what had once been a coffee table leg. Meatball was already spinning in circles, his thick, muscular body slamming into walls as he prepared for his morning routine: rampaging through the apartment and howling like a banshee.

Becky barely had time to fumble for his food before he lunged at the bowl, nearly knocking her over in his enthusiasm. A solid pound of kibble vanished in ten seconds, followed by an empty stare that said, Feed me again or I start chewing the drywall.

After wiping up the tsunami of drool, Becky grabbed his leash for their walk. Correction: Meatball’s walk. Becky’s role was to be yanked down the street like a human kite while he lunged at everything that moved.

“DON’T WORRY, HE’S A BIG BABY!” she shouted at a horrified jogger who barely dodged Meatball’s snapping jaws.

“Maybe put a muzzle on that thing,” the jogger muttered.

Becky gasped. Thing?! She clutched Meatball’s face. “You’re not a thing, you’re a sweet, misunderstood angel!”

Back home, she barely had time to change before heading to work. But first, the real priority: Meatball’s Instagram post. Carefully curating a photo of him mid-snarl (but, like, playful snarl), she typed:

“My baby boy 🥰 wouldn’t trade him for the world! Pibbles are the most misunderstood breed! If you don’t love them, you don’t deserve to breathe!! #AdoptDontShop #LandlordDiscriminationIsReal #PibbleMomLife”

That done, she finally left for work, leaving Meatball free to do what he did best: destroy everything in sight.

Hours later, she opened the front door to the overwhelming stench of urine. The couch cushions were obliterated. The coffee table was gone (like, completely gone). The walls had new holes. And in the middle of it all sat Meatball, eyes wide, tongue lolling, so proud of himself.

“Aww, baby! Did you miss me?!” Becky squealed, dropping to her knees to rub his belly.

Ignoring the dozen angry texts from her landlord about noise complaints and “dangerous dog warnings,” Becky spent the rest of the evening watching TikToks of other pit bull moms defending their angels. She nodded along, mouthing, It’s not the breed, it’s the owner.

Meatball barked at the neighbors until midnight.

Becky fell asleep on the last unchewed section of her couch, smiling to herself.

Another pibble-perfect day.

1j5mwr7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j5mwr7,"Nonna’s Trattoria – Overpriced and Inconsistent, but with Some Highlights","At first glance, the name Trattoria suggests a traditional Italian dining experience. But Nonna’s Trattoria takes a more Americanized approach—sometimes successfully, but often falling short, especially given the high prices.

The Food:
	•	Primavera Pasta – Overcooked, bland, and uninspired.
	•	Mussels – Fresh and well-balanced, easily the best dish of the night.
	•	Scallops – Not fresh, with an unpleasant smell that made them hard to eat.
	•	Citrus Risotto – Decent flavor but overcooked.
	•	Pizza – Not authentic Italian, but the sauce had a good balance of acidity and sweetness.
	•	Tiramisu – A letdown. The ladyfingers were too dry, and the mascarpone lacked its signature richness.

Drinks & Service:
	•	Limoncello – Outstanding, served at the perfect temperature.
	•	Espresso Martini – A solid option, though a bit too coffee-heavy for my taste.
	•	Service – Mostly efficient, but a server rushing to check out disrupted the experience.

On a positive note, the bathrooms were clean and smelled nice—a small but appreciated detail.

Final Verdict:

Nonna’s Trattoria isn’t the place for authentic Italian food. While the mussels and drinks were enjoyable, the inconsistent execution and high prices make it hard to recommend for a meal. Maybe worth stopping by for a well-made drink, but not much else.

1j5mkad,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1j5mkad/into_the_deep_chapter_7/,Into The Deep (Chapter 7),"The next morning, Charles and Lisa prepared for their experiment.

Charles wore a dark blue button-up shirt, the sleeves neatly rolled to his elbows, paired with well-fitted gray slacks and polished leather shoes.

Lisa, on the other hand, had chosen a more relaxed outfit.

She wore black jeans, a fitted white blouse, and a beige trench coat draped over her shoulders.

Her head was covered in a headscarf, and dark sunglasses rested on her forehead, ready to be used if needed.

They got into Charles’ car and drove toward the city center. The sound of the engine and the occasional rustle of passing cars filled the silence between them.

Forty minutes later, they arrived and parked.

Towering glass buildings reflected the morning sun, and wide streets bustled with pedestrians weaving between cars.

Shops, cafés, and electronic billboards dominated the streets, displaying advertisements in bold, colorful projections.

They sat in the car, observing their surroundings.

Fifteen minutes later, Lisa stiffened.

“There,” she murmured.

Charles followed her gaze and saw a car pull smoothly into a parking space.

The driver’s side door opened, and Lisa’s clone stepped out.

The relaxed atmosphere inside their car vanished instantly and was replaced by tense anticipation.

She was dressed in a dark gray blazer over a navy blouse, paired with fitted slacks and heels, an outfit Lisa often wore for professional meetings.

“She looks exactly like you,” said Charles.

“That bastard.”

Without hesitation, the clone turned and walked toward the tallest building in the area.

As the glass doors slid shut behind her, Lisa and Charles exchanged a glance.

They stepped out of the car, locked it, and made their way toward the adjacent mall.

The mall was spacious, its multi-level design lined with high-end stores and kiosks.

A massive digital screen played advertisements on one side of the atrium and its changing images casted brief flashes of color on the polished marble floors.

They walked toward a café near the edge of the atrium.

The café was a cozy yet modern space with warm lighting and wooden furnishings.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked pastries filled the air and created an inviting atmosphere.

The seating area was lined with cushioned booths and round tables, where customers sat engaged in quiet conversations or focused on their phones.

Charles slid into a seat, while Lisa approached the counter to order tea.

As part of their plan, she spoke in an unusually clipped and careless manner, deliberately mispronouncing her words.

The café worker, a young woman in a crisp uniform, blinked at her in confusion. “I’m sorry, could you repeat that?”

Lisa subtly studied the woman’s face. There was no recognition.

She smoothly corrected herself and returned to the table.

“She didn’t notice me,” she said to Charles as she sat down.

“That’s a good sign.”

They waited, their eyes discreetly scanning the café.

A few minutes later, the clone entered.

She approached the counter, placed an order, then settled at a table not far from them.

When her breakfast arrived, she took a few bites, then, without a word, she rose and headed toward the bathroom.

Lisa immediately followed.

Inside, one of the bathroom walls was lined with mirrors and sinks that gleamed under soft white lighting.

Lisa found the clone at the farthest sink, washing her hands while gazing at her own reflection.

Lisa stepped to the sink beside her and turned on the water.

For a brief moment, their reflections stood side by side, identical yet different.

The clone glanced at Lisa once and no more.

No double-take, no tension. Just a passing glance before she dried her hands and left.

Lisa remained, watching the door swing shut behind her.

“Did she not recognize me?” Lisa thought as she watched her reflection on the mirror.

She took a slow breath, then turned off the faucet and exited the bathroom.

Charles looked up as she returned to the table.

“She didn’t notice,” Lisa said quietly.

Charles exhaled. “That’s good.”

Without lingering, they left the café, the clone still sitting at her table, unaware of the two pairs of eyes that had been watching her.

They then made their way back to the car and drove toward the children’s school.

I’m your announcer, back with a vengeance, and tonight I’m diving headfirst into the cesspit of a GoAnimate video featuring Boris and Doris Anderson—those child-torturing, pixelated pieces of garbage. They deserve every ounce of snark I’m about to unload, so let’s fire up the screen and tear into this trash heap of a video titled *“Caillou Steals Candy and Gets Grounded”* from some sadist’s YouTube channel. Buckle up—this is gonna be brutal.

The video kicks off with Boris lounging in his ugly green jumper, looking like a discount Shrek reject, while Doris, in her tacky red overcoat, fusses over something irrelevant. Enter Caillou, the bald little punching bag of this twisted family, sneaking into the kitchen to nab a candy bar. Oh, big crime, right? Apparently, in Anderson Land, this is grounds for a full-on war crime. Boris catches him red-handed and bellows, “CAILLOU, YOU LITTLE THIEF, YOU’RE GROUNDED FOR 666 YEARS!” Six-six-six? Really, Boris? Did you pick that number because it’s your IQ or because you’re auditioning for Satan’s understudy? I mean, go fuck yourself, Boris—you’re disgusting, overreacting to a kid grabbing a Snickers like he just robbed Fort Knox.

Doris chimes in with her shrill, text-to-speech voice: “That’s right, Caillou, no candy for you, you naughty boy!” Oh, Doris, you sanctimonious hag—spare me the fake moral outrage. You’re just as complicit in this abusive clown show. The animation’s so stiff it looks like they’re all malfunctioning robots, but the real horror starts when Boris drags Caillou to the “Punishment Room.” Yes, folks, these psychos have a designated torture chamber. Boris locks Caillou in a dark closet with—get this—spiders crawling around, because nothing says “parenting” like arachnid-assisted trauma. “Stay in there until you learn your lesson!” Boris snarls, slamming the door. You child-exploiting asshole, Boris—spiders? For candy? You deserve to be in hell, you sadistic freak.

Meanwhile, Doris is outside smirking like she’s just won Mother of the Year. “He’ll thank us later,” she says, adjusting her stupid blue bowtie. Thank you for what, Doris? PTSD? You’re both torture-happy scumbags, turning a minor kid mistake into a horror movie subplot. The video cuts to Caillou crying, with those creepy GoAnimate tears, while Boris and Doris high-five like they’ve just saved the world. “Good job, honey,” Doris coos. Good job? You two are vile—exploiting your kid’s misery for some warped sense of control and a few measly YouTube views. The text-to-speech narration drones on: “Caillou learned not to steal again.” Yeah, right—he learned his parents are unhinged monsters who should be locked up, not him.

The video ends with Boris and Doris smugly sipping coffee while Caillou’s still sobbing off-screen. What a masterpiece of garbage—five minutes of animated abuse that proves these two are the lowest of the low. Go fuck yourselves, Boris and Doris—you’re disgusting, child-exploiting, abusive assholes who torture your kids for kicks. You deserve every snarky jab I’ve got, and then some.

---

### Recap Time

So, here’s the rundown of that steaming pile of GoAnimate trash: *“Caillou Steals Candy and Gets Grounded”* starts with Caillou swiping a candy bar—normal kid stuff, right? But Boris, the green-jumpered dictator, flips out and grounds him for 666 years, because apparently he’s the devil’s accountant. Doris, the red-coated enabler, backs him up like the spineless accomplice she is. They escalate from yelling to locking Caillou in a spider-infested closet—yes, a closet full of spiders—because that’s their idea of discipline. The kid’s left crying while these two sociopaths pat themselves on the back and sip coffee like they’ve done something noble. It’s a five-minute showcase of Boris and Doris being the absolute worst—exploiting and tormenting Caillou for some cheap, animated clout. Total scumbag behavior from start to finish. Boris and Doris, you’re exposed, and you deserve every bit of hate coming your way. Next time, I’ll dig even deeper—this isn’t over, you creeps.",1,1741351166.0,FamilyVloggersandmore,0,1.0,False

1j5mht4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j5mht4/my_best_friend_has_cancer_now_i_fear_her_husband/,My best friend has cancer. Now I fear her husband is hitting on me,"I (33f) and my best friend Louise (37f) met when I was a freshman in college and she was a senior. I went to a very small college and she was the first person I met on campus. She was doing the same very specialized major as me so she gave me a lot of advice and basically took me under her wing. We stayed very close even after she graduated. She really is the big sister I wish I had, we also look very much alike, so much so that most people think we are related even to this day.

Righr after college I found a nice job at a small firm doing said very specialized work. A few months into this job I was joined by Louise for a work conference (not a lot of people work in our field so it's a small circle) and we both met Nathan (43m) there. He worked in a analogue field but not exactly the same. 

We both said he looked cute but that was that. Nathan asked for my number after the conference and invited me for a drinks date. I went without any expectations and we did have a nice chat. He told me he had three kids from a previous marriage. Mind you, I was 24 fresh out of college and he was 34, his eldest son was 13 years old. I gently told him I wasn't anywhere near ready to take on any mother role and I kinda blew him off. For a few weeks he did text me multiple times saying he thought we had a strong connection and he begged me to give him a chance but I declined. We stayed in okay terms though. 

Fast forward two years and my firm was hiring. I strongly suggested we hire Louise as she had the same background as me and I vouched for her. She was hired and it was bliss to work with my best friend. I then needed to take a few months off work for a health problem. My job was fine with it and they said they'd hire a replacement.

Well lo and behold, the replacement was actually Nathan as a consultant. Like I said we had stayed on good terms so I was happy he got the job, and enough water had passed under the bridge at that point, we were cool.

After three months the both of them invited me for lunch to tell me they were officially dating. To say I was flabbergasted was an understatement but I think it was logical. Louise does look like me and so did his ex-wife. To say the man has a type is an understatement. 

Louise being 28 at this point was very comfortable taking the role of step-mom, they moved in together after a year ald got married after two. They have his kids about half the time if not more, even though the eldest is off to college now. From the get go Nathan made some unsavory jokes about Louise being the second choice after me, and when I addressed it with her she said it was all in good humor and she didn't mind. 

Now I eventually branched out professionally and specialized in Nathan's field. We are both consultants so I sometimes help him out on some projects and he helps me on mine, we sometimes work on missions at the same places. We grew a little closer because of that when before he was just ""my bf's hubby"". It has now been 8 years that they have been together. Last year they bought a house that needs reno, it's slow so they still live in their old duplex in the meantime. It didn't help that Louise got pregnant right after the sale, and she couldn't help with the reno when they said they'd tackle it together. 

Nathan started venting more and more to me about Louise at work, and I didn't know what to do so I just tried to listen without judgment. I had his version of events at work and then Louise would tell me hers around a glass of wine, it was becoming a little awkward. I suggested couples therapy which they did one session and then gave up. 

Nathan says Louise is too strict on the kids, Louise says Nathan is too loose on them. Nathan says she's a control freak, Louise says he's not organized enough. It's endless and the pregnancy made things even more complicated. 

Louise had a scheduled birth so imagine my damn surprise when Nathan calls me the day of and asks if we can discuss a project around coffee. I did go as it was outside my work but I did ask him WTF ARE YOU DOING HERE??? 
The whole time Louise was bombarding his phone, he just put it on silent. We did need to catch up on a project but it wasn't nearly THAT urgent. I begged him to TAKE HIS WIFE TO THE HOSPITAL.
He ended up agreeing and cutting it short to pick her up but... what???

She had the baby a few months back now and that boy is a bundle of joy. It seems as though Nathan was complaining a lot less about Louise during this time, and I thought their rough patch was finally over. 

Well. She called me a week ago to tell me doctors found a tumor in her right breast. It is already stage 3 so she needed to stop breastfeeding immediately and start chemo ten days later. Everybody was absolutely devastated. We had a ""last day before chemo"" girls night and we got drunk, played music, I also dyed her hair because if she's gonna lose them might as well do something memorable.

That was last week. Since then Nathan has started complaining again, though it's different. I'm afraid he will leave her. But more alarming is he started to request some time alone to grab drinks, when we don't have any projects together at the moment. 

He started to send me some spotify playlists full of my favorite songs and others I don't know. I don't know if it's a coincidence or not because we usually don't talk about music but it's very sus tbh. If it's a coincidence it's a very big coincidence. Also why is he sending me playlists?

He also just randomly texts me asking how my day is going, he reminisces about the past, last time I saw him he made plenty of compliments about my outfit and appearance... idk what to do. 

I'm afraid this is his way of making a move. Am I crazy? Am I going full paranoid? 

If he actually makes a move, of course I'd NEVER reciprocate, but should I tell Louise? She has a 6 months old and an aggressive cancer, I feel like that would break her. I dont know and I'm afraid. I don't know if I'm not imagining things and Nathan just needs a shoulder to cry on, but why me? I'm the worst person he could pick. I don't want to anger him by telling him not to text me and that we can't grab drinks. I'm single so I can't even retreat behind ""my boyfriend"" who would be jealous or something. 

I don't want to be a bad friend to either of them but I'm very uncomfortable. I really need advise. Please!",1,1741351006.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

One of the biggest things for me was one day, when my coffee was ready, she brought it too me. When she handed to me she pointed out the new design she had made in the foam. Normally it is something simple like a heart, which all the staff do, but this day it was completely different. I laughed and asked her what it was. She said it was a ghost. I laughed (too me it looked like cum) and said thats not what I see. She looked at me, in a kind of sexual way I would say, and whispered ""cum"" while playing with a straw from her drink.

Meanwhile Niccol himself is not required to relocate from his California home and maintains his ability to travel the 1,000 miles between his primary residence and the Seattle for his weekly commute via private jet. A greater hypocrisy lies in the fact that this decision to allow Niccol to commute on the company's dime completely disregards their promises to combat climate change.

>[Starbucks environmental promise](https://about.starbucks.com/our-environmental-promise-give-more-than-we-take/): “At Starbucks, we promise to *give more than we take* from the planet. Our comprehensive approach is built on our commitment to build a *more sustainable, equitable and resilient future* for coffee, farmers, communities and our planet. Across our company, we are testing and scaling innovative solutions to support partners, farmers and communities in the face of global climate change.”

 [“Starbucks touts ](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/starbucks-new-ceo-has-a-big-footprint-commutes-private-jet-nevermind-climate-goals-3df1aa5f)its “decades-long commitment to find solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change”, and claims achieving this goal “takes all of us”, it nonetheless has allowed the new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol to commute weekly from his California home via private jet”. [“Estimates, likely on the low side](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf), “indicate that his commute will release nearly nine tons of carbon dioxide each round trip. That’s roughly the annual energy-consumption footprint of the typical American household.” Shareholders did express concern over this issue, making a [proposal](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (page 96) requesting an annual emissions congruency report. The Starbucks board of directors recommended shareholders [vote **against**](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (pg 97) this proposal, claiming such a report is not an effective use of time and company resources, and they argue that Niccol should use the private jet to enhance his personal safety. The obvious solution to this is to have Niccol relocate to the Seattle area. But considering he decided to relocate the entire Chipotle headquarters, and 400 jobs, from Colorado to his city of residence in California, I doubt he would ever choose to make that move for the benefit of the company; let alone the environment.

1j5me5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1j5me5b/lingering_burning_sensation_in_urethra_2_months/,Lingering burning sensation in urethra 2 months after UTI treatment. Could it be yeast?,"So I felt symptoms coming on early jan and took a 7 day course of nitrofurantoin, but i didn’t go to the doctors or get a urine culture as I get UTIs regularly. After the course the UTI seemed to clear up but I was left with this awful burning sensation in my urethra which is constantly there 24/7 and is driving me crazy.

Went to a sexual health clinic and they ruled out lots of other causes eg HIV, Gonhorrea, Chlamydia, Hep B/C, Tricomoniasis, Syphlysis, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. Which was great - but I didn’t really think it was any of those things to begin with. 

They also tested my urine with a dipstick (negative) and looked for BV and yeast (also negative). However, I had been using canesten cream quite often in an attempt to control the burn so assume this would affect the result. They also told me that yeast infections can sometimes affect the urethra rather than the vagina, because I don’t have any itching or burning there, it’s literally just in my pee hole.

So my question is: could this be a yeast issue in the urethra? Has anyone had experience with this? 

The burning pain had eased up for a couple of weeks (cut out sparkling water and coffee which seemed to help) but it’s back again and it’s just so constant I don’t know what to do 😔 

I’m considering just taking one of the OTC yeast pills you can get (fluconazole) but is it bad to take if there’s no infection? Like would that affect good yeast in other areas of the body? I don’t really have experience with oral yeast pills just occasional canesten cream use.

I’m also worried that maybe I didn’t need that initial course of ABX and there was no infection, just cystitis maybe. Could taking a 7 day course of nitro without infection present damage my urethra? I’m guessing not as nitro is used as a low dose preventative ABX for months at a time but could be wrong.

I am a male in my 30s, and I am from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, Britain (England). I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also.

For example I have a level 10 Coffee Grinder and a maxed out Coffee Machine both are JavBreeze+ (all ads btw😂), which boosts hot drink revenue twice. My espressos go for $13.50 and a $2.7 tip per cup, but when someone orders an espresso with a vanilla bean for example, they just pay $10.01 and a $1 tip which does not make sense because it still is a hot drink.

Another issue I have is after upgrading machines, namely the coffee machine, everything feels cramped, I am unable to do other things such as prep steamed milk ahead of time because it's out of view. The change I hope to see here is whenever players upgrade their machines, their view should become higher in order to retain the same visibility and access like non-upgraded machines.

1j5manl,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1j5manl/whats_the_point_spending_more_than_a_bdb_sub_2k/,Whats the point spending more than a BDB [Sub £2k],"Slightly inflammatory title I know, obviously the BDB is far off being many folks dream machine in a lot of ways, however after spending like 2 weeks searching for a sub £2k machine with an even remotely comparable feature set that aesthetically looks less rubbish than the BDB I've come to the conclusion there simply isn't one and you're looking at £2.8k+ for a decent etc to find a machine that performs and looks better. Seems like madness to me that you have to spend an extra £1.8k to find anything that could be considered an upgrade to a decade and a half old product. I hadnt expected to try to get into this hobby only to find that spending £2k is considered 'budget' haha.

Is there something I'm missing? Are aesthetics and avoiding the plastic construction the only reason things like the Ascaso Duo and Profitec Move can exist? I'd love to buy a machine as pretty as them but given the taste of the end product should really be the biggest consideration in buying a machine, they seem functionally inferior in many ways to the vastly cheaper BDB and only win on form not function.

All the range of E61 machines sub £2k seem functionally inferior as well and on top of that you have to be OK with the gleaming metal phallus design which honestly looks much worse than the plastic BDB to me. The only E61 machine I've seen I'd actually descibe as looking 'nice' is a Synchronika with full wooden side panel and handle replacement which is prohibitively expensive. The majority seem to be plain shiny metal boxes that would be fine in a coffee shop but that no design conscious person would want in their home.

I should probably clarify what I mean by 'inferior' as I'm sure anyone reading this can tell I'm an uneducated novice, but the impression I get from my research is that it seems most machines sub £2k just don't have the tools to deal with all types of roast when compared with a £1k modded BDB. Throw a light roast at them and you don't have the same luxury of being able to control flow or low pressure pre-infusion to play with your extraction. I don't know why I'd invest this kind of money into a product that can't properly handle what actually matters, your choice of bean, and give me the tools to learn how to properly extract all types of coffee.

Apologies if this post irks some of you, I guess I'm frustrated that when looking to find a BDB alternative that doesn't look like a childrens toy there just isn't one. If anyone actually knows of a compelling alternative then please do put me out of my misery.",1,1741350329.0,espresso,18,1.0,False

My friend and I were thinking of planning a scrapbooking/journaling event in Sarnia and were wondering about the interest of people in the city. There are a variety of events like this in London/the GTA, but we have never seen anything similar in Sarnia. 

Basically it would be a couple hours of meeting new people, chatting and scrapbooking/journaling. We would supply everything required (journal, stickers, paper, washi tape, various decorations, pens/markers, glue, etc.) and the attendees could use as much as they want. We would hold the event at a coffee shop/restaurant somewhere downtown in the Spring. It would be directed towards people in their 20s-30s.
We would charge $30-$40 per person, in order to cover our costs.


My questions are:
1. Does this sounds like something you/someone you know would be interested in?
2. Do you think that is a reasonable price/would you pay that amount for tickets?
3. Do you have any advice on what we should/shouldn’t include?

Any additional comments/thoughts would be greatly appreciated. If everything went well, we would hope to make this a regular thing and host other events where people in their 20s-30s can mingle and make friends.

I don’t think we ever had a subscription, but I seem to remember one sitting on the coffee table every now and then, for a few weeks at a time. I’d sift through it, looking for something interesting, but really… once you found a show you liked, you just knew what channel it was on, what time slot it belonged to…

Sometimes, though, you’d stumble onto something new. A show you never realized was there before, tucked away in a quieter slot, running its own storylines in the background. And maybe you’d sit down one night, start watching, and realize it’s exactly the kind of thing you love… something *thoughtful*, tender, maybe even poetic. Challenging, sometimes, in the best possible way.

But then just as you're starting to think… hmmm… maybe this show is for me… maybe I can work in watching it alongside my favorite… it disappears. Leaving you wondering if you imagined it, or if maybe you just weren't paying attention when you should have.

Well. I'm perfectly content having found the show I did. Happy, even. Ecstatic. It's even better than I could have ever imagined. If it's the only show I ever get to watch, then I'll be happy as a clam.

But if those actors ever feel like reprising their roles… Well. You surely won't hear *me* complaining about it. Or, heck, maybe even a cross-over. I could see how some poetry could slip into that other program… nobody would even bat an eye.

Just one of the dumb things that happens in this brain of mine, babe. Hope you're having the loveliest of days!

PS — Speaking of time slots… I absolutely *adore* hearing you when you’re in your element. Even if I get all quiet, even if I wish I had been the one to ask a question that got you going…

1j5m4lf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j5m4lf,1 month solo trip in the Philippines,"Here’s my trip-report of my one month (mid-January to mid-February) first solo-ish trip to the Philippines as a Filipina who was born and raised in Switzerland.

**ITINERARY**

I separated my month into 4 weeks, where I would pass by Quezon City for 1-2 days. It’s also where I left most of my stuff because I traveled with one 40L backpack and a big suitcase (for pasalubong).

1.	Amadeo

My first week was spent in Amadeo, the coffee capital of the Philippines, on my dad’s ex-colleague’s private farm. Here I did various activities such as harvesting, planting, and cooking (made coconut milk, tuba, and other dishes with the plants from the farm). We were very busy on the farm, so I didn’t get to see much outside of Amadeo apart from the town center and wet market and the Taal volcano on my first day there. 

2.	Panay (Iloilo, Gigantes, Tigbauan, Laua-An, Guimaras)

I then flew out to Iloilo to see the Dinagyang festival. I booked a room through AirBnB with very lovely hosts. They offered me breakfast and we saw the festival together. The next day I did the Gigantes Island Hopping tour, which was ok, but it isn’t the best island-hopping tour because it’s very long (3-4h drive up to Carles from Iloilo, 1h boat ride to the first island).

After that I went to Tigbauan, right by the Sol Y Mar resort where I stayed at my relative’s house. I spent the day at the resort beach and their Eco-Farm (where they have a really good mango pizza, better than the one at the Pitstop in Guimaras). I was lucky to meet the owner of the resort (a friend of my relatives) who initially invited me to do a hike in Valderrama, but his guide flaked on us last minute, so we found another guide who brought us to his house near the Sadsadan Winding River. We swam in the river, had a boodle fight and chilled. It was my first time using banana trunks as plates. We then climbed up a hill, which was very hard cause there was no trail, and it was just us trying not to slide down down the soil and walking through cornfields. Up there we camped in a little bamboo shack.

The morning after, we passed by the Valderrama Mountain Resort to swim in their pool before going back to Iloilo.

I was dropped off near Oton to catch a ride to the port to go to Guimaras. There, I met up with Tommy from the Mountain Biking Tour who let me stay the night at his homestay. The next day was dedicated to the tour; it was very difficult with the heat and the hills but it’s a great way to see Guimaras.

Finally, I went back to Iloilo City where I spent my final day roaming around (the Riverside boardwalk is great), eating, café-hopping and bouldering.

I spent the night at the airport as to not spend any money on housing, however my flight ended up getting delayed 8h so I spent a total of 16h at the airport (do not recommend lol).

3.	Sagada, Banaue, La Union

After a very cold and uncomfortable (I got my period) 12h bus ride from Cubao, I arrived in Sagada and just slept the whole morning. In the afternoon, I was lucky enough to meet a Canadian couple and a French girl who was staying at the same place as me. The couple recommended us places to see and the French girl and I ended up doing some activities together which was very nice. She only spent 2 nights there so she left very quickly but then I met a Dutch girl and some locals from Ifugao while climbing on the Paytokan Wall. After that, they all left so I had to find joiner tours, which was difficult (I wrote a post expressing my frustration regarding tours). I spent most of my days chilling at cafés (thankfully their coffee is great) but was able to find joiner tours for the Marlboro Hills and Blue Soil, as well as the Sumaguing Cave.

After Sagada, I headed to Banaue where again, I had to find a joiner tour because the price of tours was even higher than in Sagada. Thankfully I joined these two retired women from France for a tour in Batad.

I underestimated the cold in the north (it was warm during the day but at night I got very cold and didn’t bring enough layers) so before heading back down to Manila, I spent one day in La Union where I just chilled because I hadn’t been getting good sleep since my first week on the farm.

4.	Manila

For my last week, I had to take it easy because I was getting very exhausted from my lack of sleep. Here I did some mall-hopping and climbing (I met up with one of the guys from Ifugao I met in Sagada). I met some people through apps, visited the National Museum of History, Intramuros and was shown around Makati (Ayala triangle, the Peninsula) and Cubao (Cubao Expo, UP)

**EXPENSES**

In total, I spent about 1.8k CHF (115k PHP) but I was very lucky to have been hosted by family and friends who also fed me a lot. I also tried to minimize my costs through tours and pasalubong (maybe a bit too much, in the end) and transport (I walked a lot instead of booking rides because I don’t know how to ride jeeps or tricycles as I don’t speak Tagalog).

\-	732 CHF on flights, \~47k PHP (GVA – MNL: 42.5k PHP but with very long layovers in Beijing but thankfully I was able to visit the city both times / MNL – ILO: 5k PHP)

\-	158 CHF on transport (buses, rides, lots of Maxim, MotoTaxi and Angkas, and my relative’s private driver), \~10k PHP

\-	154 CHF on housing (AirBnB, hostels and homestays), \~10k PHP

\-	210 CHF on food, \~13k PHP

\-	270 CHF on activities, \~17k PHP

\-	300 CHF on shopping (and my visa extension because I didn’t do my research and stayed for 31 days instead of 30 lmao), \~19k PHP

**CONCLUSION**

This was my first time ever traveling alone and I absolutely loved it. It was very difficult, but I would do it again. I came to the Philippines to see the country my parents are from but don’t really talk about (apart from unli rice). The only thing I really knew about our culture was the food but seeing small things like Filipino mannerisms made me understand why my parents act the way they do, which was very eye-opening.

In the end, I wasn’t able to do everything I planned on doing in Manila (seeing galleries, museums and Chinatown) but I left with the intent of coming back very soon (as opposed to going back every 5-10 years, this was my third time in the Philippines).

The pictures are a mix between film and iPhone photos but I filmed most of my trip with a camcorder so if you’re interested in watching my videos that I’ll be posting to Youtube, send me a PM!",56,1741349732.0,phtravel,3,0.99,False

Th next morning, Charles and Lisa prepared for their experiment.

Charles wore a dark blue button-up shirt, the sleeves neatly rolled to his elbows, paired with well-fitted gray slacks and polished leather shoes.

Lisa, on the other hand, had chosen a more relaxed outfit.

She wore black jeans, a fitted white blouse, and a beige trench coat draped over her shoulders.

Her head was covered in a headscarf, and dark sunglasses rested on her forehead, ready to be used if needed.

They got into Charles’ car and drove toward the city center. The sound of the engine and the occasional rustle of passing cars filled the silence between them.

Forty minutes later, they arrived and parked.

Towering glass buildings reflected the morning sun, and wide streets bustled with pedestrians weaving between cars.

Shops, cafés, and electronic billboards dominated the streets, displaying advertisements in bold, colorful projections.

They sat in the car, observing their surroundings.

Fifteen minutes later, Lisa stiffened.

“There,” she murmured.

Charles followed her gaze and saw a car pull smoothly into a parking space.

The driver’s side door opened, and Lisa’s clone stepped out.

The relaxed atmosphere inside their car vanished instantly and was replaced by tense anticipation.

She was dressed in a dark gray blazer over a navy blouse, paired with fitted slacks and heels, an outfit Lisa often wore for professional meetings.

“She looks exactly like you,” said Charles.

“That bastard.”

Without hesitation, the clone turned and walked toward the tallest building in the area.

As the glass doors slid shut behind her, Lisa and Charles exchanged a glance.

They stepped out of the car, locked it, and made their way toward the adjacent mall.

The mall was spacious, its multi-level design lined with high-end stores and kiosks.

A massive digital screen played advertisements on one side of the atrium and its changing images casted brief flashes of color on the polished marble floors.

They walked toward a café near the edge of the atrium.

The café was a cozy yet modern space with warm lighting and wooden furnishings.

The scent of freshly brewed coffee and baked pastries filled the air and created an inviting atmosphere.

The seating area was lined with cushioned booths and round tables, where customers sat engaged in quiet conversations or focused on their phones.

Charles slid into a seat, while Lisa approached the counter to order tea.

As part of their plan, she spoke in an unusually clipped and careless manner, deliberately mispronouncing her words.

The café worker, a young woman in a crisp uniform, blinked at her in confusion. “I’m sorry, could you repeat that?”

Lisa subtly studied the woman’s face. There was no recognition.

She smoothly corrected herself and returned to the table.

“She didn’t notice me,” she said to Charles as she sat down.

“That’s a good sign.”

They waited, their eyes discreetly scanning the café.

A few minutes later, the clone entered.

She approached the counter, placed an order, then settled at a table not far from them.

When her breakfast arrived, she took a few bites, then, without a word, she rose and headed toward the bathroom.

Lisa immediately followed.

Inside, one of the bathroom walls was lined with mirrors and sinks that gleamed under soft white lighting.

Lisa found the clone at the farthest sink, washing her hands while gazing at her own reflection.

Lisa stepped to the sink beside her and turned on the water.

For a brief moment, their reflections stood side by side, identical yet different.

The clone glanced at Lisa once and no more.

No double-take, no tension. Just a passing glance before she dried her hands and left.

Lisa remained, watching the door swing shut behind her.

“Did she not recognize me?” Lisa thought as she watched her reflection on the mirror.

She took a slow breath, then turned off the faucet and exited the bathroom.

Charles looked up as she returned to the table.

“She didn’t notice,” Lisa said quietly.

Charles exhaled. “That’s good.”

Without lingering, they left the café, the clone still sitting at her table, unaware of the two pairs of eyes that had been watching her.

They then made their way back to the car and drove toward the children’s school.
