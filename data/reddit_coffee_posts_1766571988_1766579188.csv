[](https://ads.reddit.com/register?utm_source=web3x_consumer&utm_name=nav_cta)Hello!

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

If my signal created resonating vibes with you, send me a short message about yourself or the things that make your life up. Let’s see where our conversation takes us.",1,1766579070.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Three parties in the space of a few days is a lot to prepare for, as well as a house full of guests staying for indefinite periods is enough to give anyone the vapours.  All just before Christmas Day too!

Of course, the people shooing her to bed, probably with the exception of aunt Chantelle doing her motherly bit, are all the workers who know that they get on and achieve far more without the mistress faffing about around the place, and pushing the camera into every action.  They know that she will appear, all apologies and amazement, but at least for shorter periods and the float away again back to her bed.   
Back to her bed... that is until it's time to get up, bathe, buff up the face, puff up the hair, and dress in something slinky with matching high heels, and become lady bountiful again.

Philip meanwhile, wearing a Christmas jumper that either belonged to his grandmother or he picked up at a charity shop...oops  it may well have been knitted and gifted by a loving supporter... is running around doing looking busy changing batteries and doing things that should have been done days before when preparing for guests.  

Marie and Maria, again 'neither fowl nor chicken'  prepping food to feed the hoards and yet are supposed to magically appear dressed up to the nines as guests too.  It's good that those two work well together.  Maria's honesty about the reality and influence of Instagram posts was refreshing and amusing.  As for what Marie did to the Christmas cake...hmm the jury is out on this one.  I don't think I have ever seen a rich fruit cake given the butter cream treatment!

As for the motley crew of guests, I wonder how many of them are there for Christmas.    
Vivienne is there with Isabella, so will Simon be joining them, or will they go back to Chateau Love for Christmas?    
Steve (who I thought was in Canada) and Sara (please someone take her aside and give her some tips on how to dress better), relishing in being part of the 'in crowd' for the night.    
The American 'girls' who I thought from recent reading somewhere had an issue with Stephanie because of problems with their chateau.  
Michael Petherick, never one to pass up a party invitation, there with his latest 'chauffer' Andrew. I can't make up my mind if they are a 'thing' at the moment, or if MP is just using Andrew for all his worth.  
Dana. who as she ages the hemline goes up higher.  She seems to be taking dressing tips from Philip.  It amused me that she proudly presented her 'home cured' salmon, having already seen that Marie had prepared salmon for the feast.  
Michael Potts, always dependable for baking a few loaves of bread, it must give him a sense of purpose whilst at LaLande.  Is he still with Ruth the author? I know she always wanted to be invisible, but she is never mentioned these days.  
Chris, the recipient of a last minute invite - which was kind - but not told the dress code - which was thoughtless.  
All the other full time and temporary inmates of Lalande - family and friends gathered - most happy for their screen time.  
I'm surprised they had enough beds for everyone!  
  
As for the Aussies - they came without explanation, and left without explanation too. Maybe they were only there for Pavlina's birthday bash.

To be fair to Stephanie, she does always compliment her guests.  It can be cringeworthy for us as viewers, but most of the recipients relish having something about them praised.   I think we all bloom if we are complimented about something, but unfortunately when Stephanie is complimenting everyone every time they bump into each other, it does sound somewhat insincere.

Soap - Captain Nemo Tambaku.   
Brush - Rubab men.  
Blade - Wilkinson Sword.  
ASL -  Captain Nemo Pirate Potion. 

Used coconut oil as pre shave. Ditched the spoon and used a dedicated guitar pick to scoop the soap. -2 functionality but +10 coolness. Shave went very well. I finally found my favorite blade and that is wilkinson. 2 nd 3rd use are the sweetspot for me. 

Now coming to the important topic. This is my first sotd after buying this captain nemo products. To be honest I was so dissapointed on my first use, smell was not strong and I don't even like the smell. And the ASL consitency was oily. 
But but after my 3rd Or 4th use, I came to understand and appreciate them both. It's like black coffee and beer. We need to use it more than a couple of time to truely understand it. 

The subtle tobacco fragrance is the best part of the soap and the ASL is not that oily after giving it a good shake before using, it's actually moisturizing. Both gives a good masculine vibe. I am kind of addicted to the ASL and using it daily even on my non shaving days. 

This is my first time buying bayrum product. In some previous post our brothers who used pirate potion said it is not 100% bayrum frag. But I like this frag very much. 

Both the soap and ASL are satisfactory. Thank you abir bhai. Also kindly give ur suggestion on soaps and ASL for my next purchase (based on fragrance of the products) ",1,1766578667.0,Wetshavers_India,1,1.0,False

1pum1s0,https://share.google/iuqcEOMZBnMwLsE7B,Found a coffee spot in Electronic City that actually gets it right,"So I don’t usually write food posts, but this one deserves it.

If you’re in Electronic City Phase 1 and even remotely into coffee, you need to check out Mocavo Coffee. I randomly stopped by once and it has quietly become my go-to spot.

First things first, they brew pure coffee on the spot. You can literally see them making it. No weird pre-mixes, no overly sweet nonsense. Proper coffee. Strong, clean, and smooth. You can taste the difference immediately.

Now the real surprise for me was their hot chocolate. I’m very picky about hot chocolate and most places just serve chocolate-flavoured milk. This one is thick, rich, and proper sipping chocolate. The kind that actually feels indulgent. Especially with Bengaluru’s recent chilly evenings, it hits on another level.

And then there are the Korean cream cheese buns. Soft, warm, slightly sweet, slightly savoury, and dangerously addictive. I ordered one to “try” and ended up wanting another. Perfect pairing with coffee or hot chocolate.

What I also love is that the menu has variety. You want classic coffee, they have it. You want flavoured lattes, cold coffees, different styles, it’s all there. Nothing feels gimmicky, just well-done options.

Best part? Pricing. Everything is very reasonably priced for the quality. It doesn’t feel like you’re paying extra just for branding.

TLDR:

If you’re tired of average coffee and watered-down hot chocolate, Mocavo Coffee in Electronic City Phase 1 is 100 percent worth checking out. It’s rare to find a place that gets coffee, hot chocolate, and food all right at once.

1pum04p,https://i.redd.it/zc3zmkv6859g1.png,"I built a mood-based app to help with ""dinner indecision"", and I packed it with easy/quick vegan options (plus no ads/tracking)","Hi everyone,

I’m an independent developer and a home cook. One of my biggest struggles lately has been ""decision fatigue."" I come home, I’m hungry, but I spend 20 minutes staring at my phone trying to figure out what to make that is plant-based, quick, and actually tastes good.

So, I built a tool called **CalmFoodie**.

It’s an app that suggests what to eat based on your **mood** with a single tap. If you are feeling ""Lazy,"" it might suggest a 15-minute stir-fry. If you need ""Comfort,"" it might suggest a rich lentil stew or a creamy pasta.

**Why I’m sharing this here:** While the app isn't exclusively vegan (it covers international cuisines), I put a huge amount of effort into curating a massive selection of **Vegan and Plant-Based recipes**. I wanted to move away from the stereotype that quick vegan food is just ""salad"" or ""avocado toast."" There are tons of hearty, fast meals included.

**Two important things to know before you try it:**

1. **No Photos (Deliberate choice):** I decided **not to include photos** of the final dishes. I know this is unusual, but I wanted to remove the ""Instagram pressure."" Vegan food (like curries or stews) doesn't always photograph well but tastes amazing. I want you to focus on the flavor and the process, not on making it look like a magazine cover.
2. **Metric System only (for now):** Being European, the app currently uses **grams and liters**. I know this is annoying for US users who prefer cups, and I apologize! I am working on an update to support Imperial units, but for now, you’ll need a scale.

**The ""Indie"" promise:** The app has absolutely **no ads** and collects **zero user data**. To cover server costs without selling your info, there is a tiny subscription (less than the price of a coffee/month), but I tried to keep it as accessible as possible.

**Where to get it:**

* **iOS:** It’s live on the App Store.
* **Android:** Google makes it hard for indie devs to launch publicly immediately, so it is in **Invite-Only Beta**. If you want to test it on Android, please **DM me** (at the moment the Android application **only has the Italian language** and Italian recipes, in the next few days the English language and international recipes will be implemented like the iOS app).

I’d love to know if a ""mood-based"" approach would help you in your daily cooking routine!

1pulxlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AICreatorsUnite/comments/1pulxlx/framework_the_5_blocks_nobody_talks_about/,Framework: The 5 Blocks Nobody Talks About,"You sit down to write. The page is blank. Your mind is blank.

You've tried everything:

* Changed your environment
* Adjusted your schedule
* Read other writers for inspiration
* Taken walks
* Made coffee
* Dimmed the lights

Nothing worked.

So you googled ""overcome writer's block"" and found 50 articles saying the same thing: *""Just write and don't wait for inspiration.""*

You tried. It didn't help.

Here's why: **You're probably using the wrong strategy for your specific block.**

# Writer's Block Isn't One Problem

Most advice treats writer's block as a single issue with one solution.

It's not.

Writer's block is actually multiple different problems masquerading as the same thing. Each one requires a different strategy.

# Some ""Blocks"" Aren't Even Blocks

First, let's rule out what isn't actually writer's block:

**""I'm too tired""** isn't writer's block. It's exhaustion. Sleep fixes it, not motivation.

**""I don't have time""** isn't writer's block. It's scheduling. Calendar management fixes it, not writing advice.

**""My idea isn't good enough""** isn't writer's block. It's perfectionism. Your idea becomes good *through writing*, not thinking about it.

These aren't writing problems. They're life problems.

# The Real Blocks That Sabotage Your Writing

Then there are the actual blocks:

**The Perfectionist's Paralysis:** That voice saying ""this won't be good enough, don't even bother.""

**The Blank Page Terror:** Pure emptiness paralysis—not lacking ideas, but lacking direction.

**The ""I'm Lost"" Block:** Starting to write but not knowing what you're writing (scene? monologue? description?).

**The Comparison Trap:** Reading great writing and convincing yourself yours can never compete.

**The Stakes Block:** Writing something you don't actually care about finishing.

Each one needs a different solution.

# Why Generic Advice Fails

You've probably read:

*""Just write something""* — Too vague when you're paralyzed.

*""Don't wait for inspiration""* — Doesn't address the voice saying it won't be good.

*""Write every day""* — Doesn't work if your block is about form, not discipline.

*""Know your story first""* — Impossible if you discover your story through writing.

These aren't bad advice. They're just not *your* advice. They solve different problems than the one blocking you.

It's like being told to fix a headache by changing your shoes. Maybe that works if tight shoes caused it. But if it's caffeine withdrawal, you need different medicine entirely.

# What Actually Works

Here's the key insight:

**Writing flows because of clarity and constraints, not because of inspiration.**

When you know what you're writing, why it matters, and what boundaries you're working within—your brain stops debating and starts creating.

Constraints aren't limiting. They're liberating.

# The Gap

The difference between writers who breakthrough and writers who stay stuck?

They figure out which block they actually have.

I wrote a deeper breakdown covering each block type, exact strategies for each one, and how to diagnose yours: [\[link to Medium Article\]](https://medium.com/@everydaygamer/youre-using-the-wrong-strategy-for-your-writer-s-block-76e11e1b6d0a)

I am a software developer and a home cook. I noticed that lately, the hardest part of cooking dinner isn't the actual cooking—it’s the decision of *what* to make. After a long day of work, staring at the fridge or scrolling through endless recipe sites felt like a chore.

So, I started a side project called **CalmFoodie** to solve this specific headache.

The concept is simple: instead of searching by ingredient, you search by **mood**. You tell the app how you are feeling (e.g., lazy, adventurous, need comfort, energetic), and with one tap, it suggests a recipe that matches that vibe.

It pulls from **international cuisines**, so you aren't limited to just pasta or burgers; it’s designed to give you variety.

**A couple of specific design choices I made:**

1. **Idea over perfection:** I deliberately chose **not to use photos** of the final dishes. This might seem odd, but I wanted to remove the pressure of having your dinner look like a magazine cover. The app gives you the idea and the instructions, but the result is yours. It is about the taste, not the visual competition.
2. **Metric System Note:** Being European, I built the app using the **Metric system (grams, liters)**. I know this is a pain point for US users who prefer Imperial units (cups/ounces). I apologize for this inconvenience—I am working on an update to support Imperial units soon, but right now it requires a kitchen scale or a converter.

**Transparency on business model:** I hate ads and I hate apps that sell user data. So, this app does neither. To cover the server costs and API fees, there is a very small subscription (less than the price of a coffee/month). It’s just enough to keep the project sustainable as an indie developer.

**Availability:**

* **iOS:** It is currently live on the App Store.
* **Android:** Google makes it hard for indie devs to publish openly right away, so it is in **Invite-Only Beta**. If you want to try it on Android, please DM me (at the moment the Android application **only has the Italian language** and Italian recipes, in the next few days the English language and international recipes will be implemented like the iOS app).

I would appreciate any feedback on the ""mood-based"" logic. Does it make sense to you to cook based on how you feel rather than what ingredients you have?

1pultcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/RateMyStartupIdea/comments/1pultcu/zerofriction_microsponsorship_marketplace_for/,Zero-Friction Micro-Sponsorship Marketplace for Niche Creators,"Hey r/RateMyStartupIdea, I've got an idea brewing that's laser-focused on solving a massive pain point for **niche creators**—think indie podcasters, hobbyist YouTubers, niche TikTokers, or even hyper-local bloggers with 1K-10K engaged followers. These creators grind daily but struggle to land sponsorships because brands chase mega-influencers, leaving small fish high and dry. Enter **SponsorSpark** (or whatever catchy name we land on): a **zero-friction marketplace** that makes micro-sponsorships as easy as swiping right on Tinder, but for deals under $100 that deliver real ROI.

#### The Problem We're Crushing
Niche creators have loyal, hyper-engaged audiences—perfect for brands targeting specific passions like urban beekeeping, retro gaming mods, or vegan baking hacks. But current platforms? Clunky outreach via DMs, endless negotiations, vague contracts, and payment headaches. Brands waste time hunting matches, creators ghosted after pitches. Result: untapped potential. Micro-influencer collabs already crush it—brands like **Glossier**, **HelloFresh**, **Airbnb**, and **Coca-Cola** partner with them for authentic reach at a fraction of macro costs, driving sales via peer trust and UGC. Yet, no seamless marketplace exists for true ""micro"" (under 10K followers) in super-niche spaces.

#### How SponsorSpark Works (Zero-Friction Magic)
1. **Creators Onboard in 60 Seconds**: Upload profile links, niche tags (e.g., ""Vintage Synth Tutorials""), audience stats, and set ""micro-deal"" templates like ""$50 for a 15-sec shoutout"" or ""$20 for IG Story swipe-up."" AI auto-verifies engagement rates to weed out fakes.

2. **Brands Browse & Buy Instantly**: Search by niche, location, or vibe (e.g., ""sustainable fitness gear for yoga moms""). See real-time previews of how the shoutout would look. One-click purchase via Stripe—funds escrow-held until creator delivers proof (screenshot/video).

3. **Smart Matching & Automation**: AI suggests perfect pairs, like a craft beer brand to homebrew podcasters. No back-and-forth: auto-generated contracts, instant payouts (creators get 90%, platform takes 10% cut). Creators rate brands, brands rate creators—building trust scores.

4. **Niche Power-Ups**: Hyper-filters for ""podcast-only"" or ""TikTok AR filters."" Gamified badges for top performers. Brands get analytics dashboards tracking clicks/conversions from unique promo codes.

This isn't just another influencer app—it's **microfinance meets sponsorship**, inspired by ZipSprout's non-profit model where small donors fund grassroots orgs. Scale it to creators: brands sponsor 10 micro-creators for the price of one mid-tier, multiplying brand exposure in targeted pockets.

#### Why It Wins Big (Market Validation)
- **Massive TAM**: Millions of niche creators underserved; brands spent $21B on influencer marketing in 2023, with micros growing 3x faster.
- **Revenue Streams**: Platform fees, premium creator tools (AI content generators), brand subscriptions for priority matching. Freemium for creators to hook 'em.
- **Moats**: AI-driven niche matching, escrow trust, creator-first tools. Low CAC via viral creator shares (""Just landed my first $75 deal!"").
- **Real-World Proof**: Red Bull's grassroots athlete sponsorships built empires; Chewy & Levi's thrive with pet/lifestyle micros. Imagine that frictionless.

Risks? Creator quality control (solved by AI + ratings). Brand adoption (seed with free trials to SMBs like local gyms/coffee roasters).

What do you rate this? 10/10 moonshot or needs tweaks? Would brands/creators actually use it? Hit me with feedback—let's iterate!

So I started my ADHD medication. IR 5 mg Amfexa. I do not notice anything different at all, if anything I feel lazy and even more unmotivated.  Im on titration.  I need to stay on 5mg for a week, then I'll go up to 10mg 1 time per day. 

Im just wondering a few questions. 

1.  How long will I be on this dose?  Years? Decades? Will the dose eventually increase?
2. Will the medication stop working one day, and I will have to keep increasing the dose?
3. What if I take medication for 5 years, and quit will I have serious withdrawal symptoms?  Is it safe to stop taking the medication, if for any reason there are supply issues etc?
4. What if 10mg in the morning does not last long enough, will the doctor put me on a different medication, or will he just adjust the dose? 
5. Do I need to stop drinking coffee? I drink one in the morning, and one in the afternoon.

I am very nervous about medication. and I obviously want to be well prepared on what to expect in the future.  Like, do I need to take breaks from the medication on the weekends?  

Will I have to keep increasing the dose because of tolerance etc?

Thank you .",1,1766577513.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Being new means being invisible. I know that better than most.

My dad’s in the army. That means moving every few years, sometimes sooner. New towns, new schools, new faces that never quite stick long enough to matter. By the time I hit senior year, I’d learnt how to reinvent myself like muscle memory. New clothes. New makeup. New version of me.

It was the one perk my dad insisted on. Guilt money, he called it jokingly. A fresh wardrobe every move.

We’d only been in town a week when he handed me some cash and said, “Explore. Just don’t be too late home.”

Shopping was always my first ritual. It made a place feel real.

I was crossing the street when I noticed them.

A group of girls my age sat outside a coffee shop on the corner, all facing the same direction. Not talking. Just watching the pedestrian crossing opposite them, like guards on duty.

I didn’t think much of it.

Across the road sat a shop I’d spotted earlier — a retro clothing place called In Time. Eighties jackets in the window, faded posters, mannequins dressed like they’d missed several decades.

I waited at the crossing. Traffic slowed. The light changed.

As I stepped forward, one of my bags split. Clothes spilled everywhere. I dropped to my knees, scrambling to catch them before the light changed back.

A hand reached down toward me.

I looked up.

An old man stood over me, dressed in musty, outdated clothes. A long coat. A tall, old-fashioned hat. His face was pale, expressionless — eyes dull and lifeless, like glass left too long in the cold.

He held his hand out, patiently.

I was about to take it.

“No!”

The scream came from across the street.

All the girls were on their feet, shouting, waving their arms. Panic carved across their faces.

I pulled my hand back instinctively.

When I looked up again, the man was gone.

One of the girls rushed over, helping me gather my things, ushering me back toward the coffee shop like I might collapse if she let go.

They sat me down and started talking all at once.

They told me it was stupid. A prank. A coincidence. A story they knew sounded insane.

A year ago, one of their friends disappeared at that crossing. Gone between one green light and the next. Lost in the crowd, police said.

They pointed back toward the street.

“Watch,” one of them whispered.

Traffic stopped again.

This time it was a different man standing at the crossing. Younger. Too handsome for the worn, outdated clothes he wore. He held out his hand, palm open, like he was waiting for a child.

No one took it.

People walked past him. Around him. Through him.

He crossed alone, turned the corner, and vanished from sight.

“What am I supposed to be seeing?” I asked.

“Wait,” she said.

The light changed again.

Now it was a small boy.

Maybe seven or eight years old. Dressed in clothes that looked fifty years too old. Buttoned coat. Scuffed shoes. Wrong, somehow — like a photograph that didn’t belong to this time.

He held out his hand.

No one took it.

Not once.

Adults. Teenagers. Children. They crossed around him, avoiding him without seeming to notice they were doing it.

Over and over again.

We sat there for hours, watching. Laughing it off. Making jokes.

Ghost. Prank. Social experiment.

I told myself it was grief talking. Trauma playing tricks on them.

New friends don’t come easily when you move as much as I do. I wasn’t going to lose these ones over a stupid story.

School went well. We met at the coffee shop every afternoon after that.

They talked. Laughed. Watched the crossing.

Like sentries.

Six weeks passed. Summer bled into winter. Rain replaced sunlight.

One afternoon, I was early. Dentist appointment. Empty coffee shop.

One of the girls burst in, sobbing.

“She was there,” she cried. “Right next to me. We always hold hands crossing. Always. But I didn’t look down.”

Between them stood the boy.

He took her hand.

Pulled her forward into the crowd.

And she was gone.

The space she’d been standing in felt wrong, like a gap in the world that hadn’t closed properly. People kept walking through it, laughing, talking, checking their phones, unaware that something had just been taken.

I stood there shaking, waiting for her to reappear, convinced this was some horrible mistake. A prank. A panic. Someone would come running back any second now, breathless and embarrassed.

No one did.

The girl beside me kept crying, repeating her name into her phone like saying it enough times might make her answer. I watched the crossing instead.

The lights changed again.

Traffic stopped.

People crossed.

Nothing happened.

That made me angry.

Angry at the girls for believing this nonsense. Angry at myself for letting it scare me. Angry that everyone else could just keep walking like the world hadn’t tilted.

This wasn’t some curse. This was coincidence layered on top of grief. And if it wasn’t — if something really was happening at that crossing — then I wasn’t going to sit there and let it take another person.

I wasn’t a child.

I wasn’t stupid.

And I wasn’t going to be afraid of a story.

I wanted to see him again. I wanted him to look at me. To explain. To prove this was nothing.

To prove I was right.

That’s when I stepped away from the café table.

I crossed the street alone.

The rain hammered down as the light changed. I closed my eyes and held out my hand.

Something touched me.

Not skin.

Weight.

Cold.

It felt like a chain locking around my soul.

The crossing stretched.

Endlessly.

The shops melted away into ice and snow. Wind screamed across a frozen wasteland. Bodies lay scattered along the path — frozen where they fell. At first, they wore summer clothes. Further along, coats. Scarves. Gloves.

My companion walked beside me.

The old man.

His face was blue with frostbite. Skin cracked and split like porcelain. His grip was unbreakable.

I tried to scream. Nothing came out but cold air.

I saw her then.

One of my friends.

Frozen at the edge of the path, twisted and broken. She’d walked a long way before she died.

I stopped feeling my legs. Then my arms. Then anything at all.

The man dragged me forward when I could no longer walk.

I understood then.

This wasn’t cruelty.

This was loneliness.

A traveller lost in the snow, offering his hand again and again, hoping someone would take it.

The last thing I heard wasn’t spoken aloud.

Not evil.

Not hunger.

It sounds simple, almost obvious like a quiet rule of life we already know but forget to follow.
At first, it reminds me of something ordinary. A cup of coffee, freshly poured, warm in your hands. Leave it untouched for too long and it cools. Not suddenly, not loudly just slowly, until the warmth you once felt is gone. And no matter how much you question it later, the truth remains: warmth doesn’t survive neglect.
Life works the same way.
There are things that enter our lives full of warmth relationships, dreams, opportunities, moments of connection. They arrive alive, asking for attention, for presence, for care. But we get distracted. We assume there will be time later. We delay the call, postpone the visit, silence our feelings. We believe that what matters to us will patiently wait until we’re ready.
But nothing truly warm waits forever.
Time moves. Life moves. And without nourishment, even the most meaningful things begin to cool. People grow distant. Chances quietly pass. What once felt alive starts to feel unfamiliar. Not because it stopped mattering but because it wasn’t held when it needed to be.
That’s why nurturing matters.
Why showing up matters.
Why choosing now instead of someday matters.
When something matters to you, it needs your energy, your words, your effort, your care. Warmth is sustained by attention. And when we fail to nurture what’s important, we shouldn’t be surprised when it no longer feels the same.
But as I sit with this truth, another understanding gently emerges.
What if not everything that grows cold is lost because we failed it?
What if some things cool because they were never meant to stay warm forever?
Not every connection is meant to last a lifetime.
Not every dream is meant to remain the same.
Not every chapter is meant to be held onto endlessly.
Some things are seasonal. Some people are lessons. Some moments come only to shape us not to stay. And when they grow cold, it doesn’t always mean we did something wrong. Sometimes it simply means the moment has completed its purpose.
Cold coffee isn’t ruined it’s just different.
And in the same way, memories don’t lose their value just because they no longer live in the present. Some warmth is meant to exist only in hindsight, only in the heart.
Letting go doesn’t mean you didn’t care.
It means you cared enough to stop forcing something to remain what it no longer is.
Life asks us to learn two equally difficult skills:
to nurture what truly needs us and to release what no longer does.
So if something in your life has grown cold, don’t rush to blame yourself. Ask instead: Was this something I needed to nurture more or something I needed to outgrow?
Because what you don’t nurture, you may lose.
But what is meant to leave will cool no matter how tightly you hold it.",1,1766577377.0,heillp,0,1.0,False

In 1991 there were not only the first presidential elections in Russia. Mayors were elected in Moscow and Leningrad (now Saint-Petersburg). Severodvinsk was also awarded this honor in the spirit of democracy. The townspeople elected the chairman of the city council, Valery Lyskov, as mayor.



**Why we are worse than capitals**



I (Not exactly me. Remember, I just copy from Russian newspaper and translate to English here) witnessed these and further events: I worked for the newspaper “Severny Rabochiy” and covered the activities of the city government. How did Severodvinsk manage to stand on the same level as the capitals? The Democratic deputies of the City Council carried out enormous preparatory work, overcoming all legislative norms. Of course, Vladimir Rasskazov, People's Deputy of the RSFSR, a teacher at Sevmashvtuz, helped. Contacts in Yeltsin's entourage were involved. In those days in the spring of 1991, at parliamentary meetings there was no other topic than the question: will they allow it or not? The Council's lawyers, having returned from another Moscow business trip, told how the case was progressing and in what authority the paperwork was being handled. And then back on the plane and back to the capital. We waited for the good news. By resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the RSFSR, such a procedure for popular elections was allowed in Severodvinsk as an experiment. Meanwhile, there were only 2 weeks left for the election campaign. The rival from the city committee of the CPSU and, presumably, the leadership of defense enterprises, was the chairman of the city executive committee, Albert Dobryakov, who previously held the post of director of CHPP-1. The winner, as one would expect, was the candidate of the democratic forces, the chairman of the Council of People's Deputies of Severodvinsk, the chief technologist of Zvezdochka, 45-year-old Valery Lyskov. He scored 61% of the votes against 18 for Dobryakov.



A tragic fate awaited the first mayor of Severodvinsk. What brought him to the dock and, during long trials, to death in a pre-trial detention center hospital? The deputies were the first to rebel against their own chosen one, and this happened soon.



**A whole platoon**



What time was it - the early 90s? Waves of democracy swept across Severodvinsk. The economic background is devastation; after price liberalization, inflation is 2,500%. It was not because of the good life that the city turned into a large market; even opposite the city hall near the Rainbow department store, trade was going on right on the ground, shuttle traders were carrying goods from Moscow markets. Entire families were fed by trade. The most necessary things are available on coupons, but alcohol and Amaretto liqueur of all colors of the rainbow are available at kiosks at bus stops at any time of the day or night. Nothing was prohibited, just like single pickets on the porch of City Hall.



Against this background, in March 1990, the first alternative democratic elections to the Council of People's Deputies of Severodvinsk took place. 185 deputies were elected, by military standards - a motorized rifle company.



By the way, the current deputies celebrated the 25th anniversary of the City Council this year. The history of city representative power, in my opinion, began not in 1997, but earlier.



**Rally passions**



In my archive, this list of 185 people is preserved on several A5 sheets. The deputy's district represented 4-5 houses. And the people's choice himself was well known there, since he lived in the neighborhood: his address and even his home telephone number were indicated. Such representation brought together people of different professions: journalists, technical intellectuals, cooperators, as entrepreneurs were called then, and there were quite a few military personnel. Among the leaders, Nikolai Suslov, director of the oil depot, was especially noticeable. And the most inconspicuous is the general director of Sevmash, David Pashayev, who previously went through the election procedure for this post with the entire team. In the hall of the Central Committee of Culture and Music he always occupied the highest place in the row. After sitting for a while, he got up and left the hall. And there the passions of the meetings raged on almost every issue. Then they continued in the editorial offices, where deputies reproached journalists for bias, and even threatened them with legal action. The Democrats came to power under the banner of the fight against the old system, the privileges of the nomenklatura, and the unfair distribution of apartments. Severodvinsk then thundered throughout the country with housing issues when one of the central newspapers published material on this topic by the People's Deputy of the USSR, Arkhangelsk journalist Alexander Emelyanenkov.



**As operatives**



The mayor also became the target of criticism on many counts. What was he like? Judging by the fact that he stayed in office for only two years and was already arrested in June 1993, it is difficult to judge this. And human qualities attracted people; journalists had a democratic relationship with the mayor. If he was in the office, he picked up the phone himself and called if necessary. The protective press services appeared later.



One day I went into his office to do another interview. He was clearly upset and started talking: “They’re just digging under me. I took money for the trip from Venta, and I represented the city at that football tournament. And the only purchases are gloves...""



It was about the mayor's sensational trip to Norway, sponsored by a company involved in the vodka business. Those guys helped a lot. Frankly, I once had to contact them to pay for the prizes for the winners of an editorial competition. There was no money in the editorial office.



A few years after the above-mentioned events, one of the deputies who worked on the commission to remove the mayor came into my office. Moreover, he worked very actively, judging by the collected material. I still didn’t understand what these papers were for: to once again convince me of the correctness of my actions or, on the contrary, to repent that I had gone too far.



...Here is an appeal from a certain group of citizens, where, among other complaints, the abundance of garbage in the city, the lack of promised sugar, and the increase in bread prices are mentioned. Request to the prosecutor's office regarding the closed case against my son.



It was no secret that the two branches of government were pulling powers from each other. Yes, Lyskov changed the structure of the mayor's office without approval, made committee chairmen his deputies, took over the reserve fund, etc. But in the folder I also found documents of another kind, received at the request of deputies already at the level of their operational actions. Here is a copy of a photo of the mayor's dacha - a structure similar to a barn, and the explanation of the head of the RSU about the installation of a panel house. Certificates from Sberbank to the same deputies about loans to the mayor and his wife, a certificate from Zvezdochka about the wife’s salary. This is about the allegedly illegal allocation of an apartment to her in a building owned by an oil depot. Apparently, such a gesture was made to improve the living conditions of the mayor's family. But it is surprising what the level of powers of the people's representatives was. Or did they install them themselves?



**Celebration before arrest**



The confrontation ended with the fact that in March 1993, having accused Lyskov of “excessively close ties with commercial structures and abuse of power,” the deputies decided to express no confidence in him with a recommendation to relieve the head of the regional administration from his post. Although the law requires that this issue be resolved through a referendum.



The celebration of Russia Day that year, which took place at the Sever stadium, remains in my memory. It was a truly summer day, people in the stands applauded Lyskov in a light suit, who opened the holiday, which was the last in his life. Vladimir Presnyakov and his “Flight Attendant” were greeted with applause. People walked along the paths of the stadium, stood at sales tents, near which there were boxes of champagne.



Meanwhile, Lyskov’s case reached the region. Pavel Balakshin, despite the protest of the regional prosecutor, in mid-July 1993 issued an order to release Lyskov from office, citing Art. 5 of the Law of the Russian Federation “On the procedure for the appointment and dismissal of heads of regional, regional, and city administrations.” Although the article is about an appointed and not an elected head. By that time, the mayor himself was already under arrest on charges of corruption and abuse of power.



**Moscow forces didn’t help either**



The head of the independent Severodvinsk TV channel “K-8”, the famous columnist Sergei Nepogodiev, kept a chronology of those events by date. They tried to save Lyskov by using Moscow forces from the presidential administration, a special commission worked, and letters were sent to Balakshin demanding that the order be canceled. It seemed like this would happen. But it didn't happen. What or who forced the regional authorities to retreat? Who needed to keep an unhealthy person in a pre-trial detention center for a year and a half? And who could be behind them? The question is still open.



The deputies put the finishing touches on the Lyskov case. On July 30, at a meeting of the Severodvinsk Small City Council, a unanimous decision was made to propose to Balakshin to nominate him for the position of the new head of the city administration at the next session of the City Council. That's what they did.



As Sergei Robertovich said, many of the participants in those events are still alive today, with good positions and ranks. I once asked a former deputy whether his conscience was gnawing at him, and he only laughed in response...



**Funeral on Dzerzhinsky Street**



I asked journalists who went to court hearings what exactly was Lyskov accused of? They talked about canned food from humanitarian aid found in the garage, apparently helpfully donated by those who stood at the distribution. The bribe included boards and a coffee maker. And for everything, even proven in court, could there be such a retribution?



By a terrible coincidence, the coffin with the body of the deceased was placed near the house on Dzerzhinsky Street. Valery Ignatievich lived there. There were only a few days left before the New Year of 1995, and there was wet snow, so we had to stretch the film over the coffin. A crowd had gathered, so I barely managed to squeeze through with the flowers. An impromptu meeting took place, angry words were heard that Lyskov had become a victim of the system. A person is not a criminal if guilt is not proven... The relatives decided to bury Lyskov, as I heard, away from the city that killed him.



And the fate of the “platoon” of local deputies was determined by Yeltsin’s Decree on reforming local councils, which followed the October events of 1993. They were dissolved, and power was transferred to the appointed administration. The head of the regional administration appointed the former secretary of the city party committee, Vyacheslav Roslyakov, as mayor of Severodvinsk. The experiment with elections ended, and the pause continued until 1996. The popularly elected mayors were Alexander Belyaev and Mikhail Gmyrin. Since 2017, the people have been essentially excluded from direct elections of the mayor.



**Quote from the book:**



>“We studied with Valery for 11 school years. He was our friend. And, it’s safe to say, a leader. Deservedly respected by us and the teachers of our school. An excellent athlete. Already in the 10th grade, he played for the adult city football team. He successfully competed in city and regional athletics competitions, was the captain of the basketball team... The last time we saw him was when we met in June 1993 on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of graduation No. 76 in Kotlas. He was going to Moscow for a reception with the Prosecutor General V. Stepankov. We tried as best we could to encourage him, we believed in his honesty and innocence. He was a great family man, his untimely provoked death is an irreparable loss for his wife Larisa, children Kostya and Marina, grandchildren... and we, his classmates, fully support the initiative to appropriate one of the streets of Severodvinsk. maybe Kotlas “Named by Mayor Lyskov.”

But, unfortunately or fortunately, there is also information that gives the opposite of what they say about Valery Lyskov. Next will be a monologue from Evgeny Belakovsky and Andrei Maslennikov. The first, in 1989-1991, was the secretary of the Severodvinsk city committee of VALKSM, and a deputy of the Arkhangelsk Regional Assembly of Deputies, the second, in 1989-1991, was his own correspondent for the ""Volna"" (""Волна"", eng: a Wave (apparently because of White sea)) newspaper in the city of Severodvinsk:



>“In 1989, about two hundred people were elected to the Severodvinsk City Council, including the chief technologist from Zvezdochka Valery Lyskov. The City Council became a cross-section of society, and the “foam” came in, which, instead of approving the budget, played at democracy and brought up the issue of supporting Lithuania... I won’t say that V. Lyskov was “inadequate”, he was the chief technologist of “Zvezdochka”, this is a very decent position. At the first session, he ran for chairman of the city council, but looked pale, and no one was elected. Valera Lyskov came and said: Let the three of us sit down - you, me and Dmitriev - and decide who will be the chairman!” We agreed - Lyskov is the chairman, Dmitriev is the deputy, and we are helping him in the regional council to become deputy chairman

>

>Two days later there was another election for the chairman of the city council, Lyskov went on stage, made the deputies laugh by proposing to open brothels, and they voted for him. As chairman of the city council, he began to “butt heads” with the executive branch, not to regard the pre-city executive committee A. Dobryakov as anything. And when the mayoral elections began, he quickly prepared the documents and nominated himself. Albert Dobryakov led the campaign palely, and the situation in the city began to be bad. Valera won and, having been elected, began to butt heads with the City Council, which he had just headed

>

>For the time being, Valery Lyskov was a sane person, but then “the roof was blown away.” He said that there are only three popularly elected mayors in the country - he, Gavriil Popov and Anatoly Sobchak, that he is inviolable, only the people can recall him. He began issuing licenses for the sale of alcohol and gave permission to only one company in Severodvinsk.

>

>Valery Lyskov thought that he was the owner of the city, and behaved this way towards everyone. Nikolai Grigorievich Orlov was then the general director at Sevmash, the mayor came to him, saying, ship the furniture to me. Orlov refused, Lyskov said: “I will make a decision so that the water area of ​​Severodvinsk becomes a nuclear-free zone.” A bad precedent would have taken place, but our deputies did not allow it. The war between the mayor and the city council began... When there was a putsch in 1991, the deputies created a headquarters and spoke for B. N. Yeltsin. Deputy Teterevlev spoke, Puzyrev, and the mayor disappeared somewhere, as if he had evaporated. Then, when the State Emergency Committee was defeated, Valery Ignatievich appeared and issued an order to remove the director of “Zvezdochka” A.F. Zryachiy - allegedly he supported the State Emergency Committee. The heads of defense enterprises began to be fired, and a circus began. As a result, he was accused of corruption... I think he came into the sphere of interest of the intelligence services earlier, because everyone complained about him. They picked him up on the porch of the city hall and took him to prison. They were accused of taking bribes, one of the incidents was a kettle, a coffee maker and a furniture set...

>

>As a journalist, I looked at our security officers, they showed footage of large bags of American humanitarian aid being pulled out of Lyskov’s garage. They also accused me of some kind of furniture set. The trial began, I was present, I even interviewed him briefly. To be honest, when he was sitting in the cage, I felt sorry for him. And suddenly they say that the trial is postponed, that his heart is bad. He was in the temporary detention center, I called there and asked the doctor if there was a threat to his life. The doctor said that it was nonsense, everything would pass, and the next day they reported that Lyskov had died - his heart had failed. Apart from Valery Lyskov, there were no more frostbitten people in power, but a whole galaxy of them blossomed nearby. In the offices of these characters they listened and nodded, but they didn’t get any apartments or anything. Many later went to prison. The “inadequate” were militant, active guys. I cannot call Valera Lyskov “inadequate,” he just wanted sole power.

>

>...What does the history of Severodvinsk teach in the 1990s? In a city where almost everyone was making the country’s “nuclear shield,” people were elected to power who, wittingly or unwittingly, damaged this important work. It would be better if they helped.”



So, the first mayor, and why am I already talking about what post about mayors? Because before that there were the First Secretaries of the city committee of the CPSU (b) - CPSU, and I simplified it by calling them mayors. But they were first secretaries, so Valery Lyskov became the first real mayor after the collapse of the USSR.

So I've always had trouble making friends. I'm over 35 F and have no friends. I travelled to a different country and been here for 17 years and still have no friends. However, I am fine with it, I am still friendly and social if people talk to me, but if they then move on, I don't feel bad and just keep myself busy then.

Yes, I have tried many times, but it seems people are just bored with me? I am not rude, I try to get to know them and listen to them, but nobody likes listening to me and I am just sick of pretending anymore.

I tried so hard in the past: at parties, evne thought I made a good friend and hung out a few times for dinner, but then suddenly they said they were to busy with work and I never heard from them again.

Then, I tried to make friends online, and other women just don't talk much? I want to get to know them and they just answer very short answers and it makes me not want to get to know them since they don't seem interested either.

One girl I thought I could get along with and we had coffee and it was nice. But then all I hear about from her is how bad her life is going and I tell her to get help, then I stopped hearing from her, then again a message that seems normal and asks how I am, and when I ask them, again it's just how bad her life is. I tell her it's ok, and sometimes life is like that, but I have my own problems and really just don't want to get to know this person more anymroe and stopped contact.

My partner's friends are nice, they have kids and are cool. I found out from the kids today though they think I'm weird, and I feel a little bad but not angry or anything, I've always been different I guess and I know this since I can't keep friends, but, I'm not going to get sad about it. I am nice, never let my anger be rude to a person and I give people space. If people keep asking me questions and while I'm talking , they stop paying attention and talk to a different person, I'm tired of chasing it up and I just sit back and drink something till they involve me again.

People are nice, but I just can't seem to click with them. My partner has a very close relationship with these friends and I do care for them, but I just hate being the third wheel. I tried talking to him about it and he gets angry, and fair enough, I guess it's just my issue since in the grand scheme of things, I'm the one who hasn't got any friends so it's probably me. I just can't seem to have fun in social situations? Today I just didn't ant to talk to anyone, I just don't care anymore if people think I'm weird or rude, I just don't have the energy.

After today we were at a party, and I just got tired so quickly, I had to go home and take a 3 hour nap and still tired for sleep tonite.",1,1766576369.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1pulg3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFabric/comments/1pulg3f/distributed_rubber_duck_thin_notebooks_deep/,Distributed Rubber Duck: Thin Notebooks; Deep Libraries,"Hi all,

This is a new post format I'm trying. Basically its a kind of stream of consciousness/stand-up/brain d\*mp (apparently the word d-u-m-p violates the [Microsoft exam and assessment lab security policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/support/exam-and-assessment-lab-security-policies?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social_media&utm_campaign=r_microsoftfabric&utm_content=textlink).) where I use you, the Fabric community, as my [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) instead of the colleagues I lack my current org's data engineering team of one (me). Basically, you are getting the front-row seat to my inner thoughts and turmoil as I muddle my way through trying to wrangle a decade's worth of spreadsheets and undocumented bash scripts into something resembling a modern (or at least robust) data stack. I'd normally write something like this over on [medium](https://medium.com/@callumdavidson_96733), but being mainly about Fabric, posting here seems like a better idea.

I’ve been using Fabric “properly” for the better part of a year now. By which I mean I’ve worked out a CI/CD setup I don’t hate, and I have a dozen or so pipelines pumping data into the places it needs to go. I’ve also been complaining about Fabric on here for roughly the same amount of time, so I'm basically a veteran at this stage. But, to be fair, the pain points are gradually shrinking and the platform genuinely has promise.

Sometime this year, we crossed the point where I’d call Fabric basically production-ready, meaning most of the missing features that were blocking *my version* of a production setup have either landed or can be worked around without too much swearing. We’re close now. At least close to what I want. And the future actually looks pretty good.

# What am I even meant to be talking about?

Right. The point.

*Thin Notebooks; Deep Libraries* \- which I’m now calling TiNDL (my pattern, my rules) - is an architectural pattern I’ve arrived at independently in at least three different Fabric integrations. That repetition felt like a smell worth investigating, so I figured it might be worth writing about. 

Partly because I have no one else to talk to. Partly because it might be useful to someone else dealing with similar constraints. I don’t claim to have all the answers - if you make it through most of this post, you’ll discover my development process involves a lot of wrong turns and dead ends. There is a very real chance someone will comment ""why didn’t you just do X?"" and I’ll have to nod solemnly and add another notch to the belt of mediocrity.

# The problem I’m actually trying to solve

I work at a medium-sized financial services company. My job is to feed analysts numbers they can use for… whatever analysts do. The data comes in through a truly cursed variety of channels: APIs, FTP servers, SharePoint swamps, emailed spreadsheets. What the analysts want at the end of that process is something reliable and trustworthy.

Specifically: something they can copy into Excel without having to do too much reverse engineering before sending it to a client.

Like all data engineering, this splits roughly into:

* the stuff that gets the data, and
* the stuff that transforms the data

TiNDL is mostly about the second bit.

Getting data out of messy systems is actually something an ad-hoc collection of notebooks and dataflows is pretty good at. Transformation logic, on the other hand, has a nasty tendency to metastasise.

# The spaghetti monster

The issue we have (and that most of you will recognise) is the proliferation of different-but-similar transformation processes over time. Calculating asset returns is a good example.

On paper, this is simple: take a price series and compute the first-order percentage change. In reality, that logic has been duplicated everywhere analysts needed it, and now we have dozens (if not hundreds) of slightly different implementations scattered across dashboards and reports.

And despite how simple returns sound, the details matter:

* business vs calendar days
* regional holidays
* reporting cut-offs
* missing or late prices

So now you’re looking at a number and asking: how exactly was this calculated? And the answer is often ""it depends"" and then ""look at this spreadsheet, it's in there somewhere"".

This is why we invent things like the medallion architecture, semantic layers, and canonical metrics. The theory is simple: centralise your transformation logic so there’s one definition of ""return"", one way to handle holidays, one way to do anything that actually matters.

This is where Fabric entered the picture.

# Why notebooks felt like the answer (at first)

I’m a Python-first engineer. I like SQL, but I like Python more. I don’t like low-code. Excel makes my toes curl.

Fabric notebooks felt like the obvious solution. I could define one notebook containing the business logic for calculating daily returns, parameterised by metadata, and then call that notebook from pipelines whenever I needed it. One notebook, one definition, problem solved.

https://preview.redd.it/sv52gid4z49g1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a209c7aa534e1a4a8f6708739fe6a82c5338721

And to be fair, I got pretty far with this. I had a solid version running in PPE. Movement of metrics between Bronze and Silver was metadata-driven. I'm a big, big fan of metadata driven development. Mainly because it forces you to document high-level transformations as metadata, and because it forces you to think carefully about transformations and re-use code. How I implement it is probably a conversation worthy of a post (if you are interested, I can spin something up).

Here’s an example of a transformation config for daily NZ carbon credit returns, business-days only, Wellington holidays observed:

        - transformation_id: calculate_daily_returns
            process_name: Calculate Daily Price Returns from Carbon Credit Prices
            datasource_id: carbon_credits
            active: true
            process_owner: Callum Davidson
            process_notes: >
              Calculates daily price returns from NZ Carbon Credit 
              price data ingested from a GitHub repository. The prices
              are only reported on business days with Wellington 
              regional holidays observed.
            input_lakehouse: InstrumentMetricIngestionStore
            input_table_path: carbon_credits/nz_carbon_prices_ingest
            price_column: price
            date_column: date
            instrument_id_column: instrument
            currency_column: currency
            business_day_only: true
            holiday_calendar: NZ
            holiday_calendar_subdivision: WGN
            select_statements:
              - SELECT 
                  'NZ Carbon Credits' as instrument, 
                  'NZD' as currency, 
                  * 
                FROM data WHERE invalid_time IS NULL
    

This worked. Almost.

# Where it started to fall apart

The first issue was code reuse. Reusing code across notebooks in Fabric is… not great. `%run` exists, but it’s ugly, and not available in pure-Python notebooks (which I prefer, especially with Polars). Passing parameters around from pipelines helps a bit, but I still ended up copying chunks of code between notebooks just to deal with config parsing and boilerplate.

But the bigger issue, the one I couldn’t ignore, was **testing**.

Notebooks absolutely suck for testing.

Ok, they are get for *testing out an idea*, but they are bad for unit testing.

How do you unit test a notebook? You don’t. You test it against whatever data happens to be in DEV, and then - if we’re being honest - again once it hits prod. “Looks OK in DEV” is not a testing strategy, especially for business-critical financial metrics.

Yes, you *can* debug notebooks. You can print things. You can rerun cells and squint at DataFrames. But it’s slow, stateful in weird ways, and tightly coupled to whatever data happens to be in your lakehouse that day.

That’s not debugging. That’s divination.

And the killer is that this friction actively discourages good behaviour. When iteration is painful, you stop exploring edge cases. When reproducing a bug requires rerunning half a notebook in the right order with the right ambient state, you quietly hope it doesn’t come back.

The last thing (and I loathe to admit this) is that there *is* merit to a very constrained, boring, OOP-ish inheritance pattern here.

Look at what we’re actually doing:

1. Read data from Bronze
2. Validate / normalise inputs
3. Apply a domain-specific transformation
4. Validate output schema
5. Write to Silver
6. Emit logs / metrics / lineage

Steps 1, 4, 5, and most of 6 are invariant. The only thing that really changes is step 3, plus a bit of metadata.

That’s not inheritance-for-the-sake-of-it. That’s a textbook template method pattern:

* a base transformation class that knows how to read, validate, write, and log
* subclasses that implement *one* method: the transformation logic

Trying to do this cleanly across a dozen notebooks is a nightmare. 

# What I actually wanted all along: a library

Which brings me (finally) to the point I’ve been circling for about 2,000 words.

What I really wanted was a *proper Python library.*

Libraries:

* can be developed locally
* can be unit tested properly
* can be versioned sanely
* can be released in a controlled way
* encourage structure instead of copy-paste

Most importantly, they let me treat business logic like *software*, instead of a loosely organised pile of notebooks we politely pretend is software.

So the goal became:

* write transformation logic in a Python package
* write real unit tests with synthetic and pathological data
* run those tests locally and in CI
* build the package into a wheel
* publish it to an Azure DevOps artifact feed
* install it in Fabric notebooks at runtime
* keep notebooks thin, boring orchestration layers

# Fabric, libraries, and the least-shit deployment option

Fabric *does* support custom Python packages. You can attach wheels to Fabric Environments, which then apply to all notebooks in a workspace. On paper, this sounds like the right solution. In practice, it’s not quite there yet for this use case.

Attached wheels get baked into environments. Updating them requires manual intervention. That’s fine for NumPy. It’s clunky for first party code you expect to change often.

What I want is:

* push a new version
* have notebooks pick it up automatically
* know exactly which version ran (because I log it)

Environments don’t really give me that today.

So instead, I[ install from the ADO feed at runtime.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFabric/comments/1oqgh3j/how_to_custom_python_package_management_with/)

Yes, it costs \~20 seconds on startup.  
No, I don’t love that.  
Yes, it’s still the least painful option right now.

But this is a batch pipeline. I waste more time working out which of the four cups on my desk has the coffee in it.

This is one of those ""perfect is the enemy of shipped"" moments. A better solution is apparently coming. Until then, this works.

Now the architecture looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/kev7bk8o059g1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f87ab8de452a69361842ed3d41009bdf11a2c8b

Once all the logic lives in the library, the notebook becomes almost aggressively dull.

Something like this:

    from fabric_data_toolkit.metrics import transformations
    import polars as pl
    from uuid import uuid4
    
    RUN_ID = RUN_ID or str(uuid4())
    
    config_path = f'{silver_lakehouse}/Tables/dbo/transformation_configs'
    config_data = pl.scan_delta(config_path).collect().to_dicts()
    
    logs_table = f'{silver_lakehouse}/Tables/staging/transformation_logs'
    metrics_table = f'{silver_lakehouse}/Tables/staging/transformation_metrics'
    
    transforms = [
        transformations.build_transformation(config, run_id=RUN_ID)
        for config in config_data
    ]
    
    metric_write_mode = 'overwrite'
    log_write_mode = 'overwrite'
    
    for transformer in transforms:
        print(f""Running: {transformer.log.process_name}"")
        result = transformer.run()
    
        pl.DataFrame([transformer.log]).write_delta(
            logs_table,
            mode=log_write_mode,
            delta_write_options={
                ""schema_mode"": ""overwrite"" if log_write_mode == ""overwrite"" else ""merge"",
                ""engine"": ""rust"",
            },
        )
        log_write_mode = 'append'
    
        if transformer.log.success:
            result.write_delta(
                metrics_table,
                mode=metric_write_mode,
                delta_write_options={
                    ""schema_mode"": ""overwrite"" if metric_write_mode == ""overwrite"" else ""merge"",
                    ""engine"": ""rust"",
                },
            )
            metric_write_mode = 'append'
        else:
            print(""\tError"")
    

# And the point of all this?

Honestly? I’m not sure there is a grand one.

This has mostly been me explaining a pattern that made my life easier and my numbers more trustworthy. If it helps someone else in a similar situation - great.

If nothing else, it’s cheaper than therapy.

I'm talking 80+ pages big, on a topic that is completely new for me. The amount of work makes me nervous, so naturally I decided to revive my old stainless steel pan instead.

So I grab the white vinegar and the steel scrubber and get to work. After letting the vinegar sit in the pan for a while, I decided my steel coffee filter needed a clean too. As I was boiling my filter with some baking soda water, I actually started craving a cup of coffee.

While brewing the coffee, I thought the pan had soaked enough and started scrubbing. I scrubbed and scrubbed and after an hour all the rust was gone! Time to season the pan with some new oil. So I poured oil in the pan, put it on the stove, turned it on high and...

Oh shit my coffee. Well, iced coffee is nice too! Let's see, some soy milk, ice cubes... Where is my vanilla essence?

What is that smell? Oh no, the oil is burning! I look at the pan, and the oil has completely seared into the pan. I need to start all over again and scrub the burned part away...

  
It's now halfway through the workday. The pan? *Cleaned and seasoned.* The coffee? *Drunk.* The report? *There's now three sentences and a pretty figure* 🫶🏼",4,1766576306.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I did a video review but these are the key takeaways .. 

The standout for me is the harness system. Once it’s dialled in, the pack just disappears. No shoulder fatigue, no shifting around when standing on the pegs, and zero pressure points even after hours in the saddle. It feels more like part of your riding gear than a backpack.

Capacity-wise, 18L is a sweet spot. Big enough for waterproofs, tools, camera gear, and food, but not so big that you overpack or feel top-heavy. The internal layout is simple but practical, and the roll-top closure gives confidence when the weather turns. I’ve ridden in heavy rain and everything inside stayed bone dry.

Build quality is exactly what you’d expect from Kriega — properly rugged. Thick materials, solid stitching, and zips that feel like they’ll outlast the bike. It’s clearly designed for people who actually ride, not just commute to coffee shops.

One thing I didn’t expect to appreciate as much is how stable it feels off-road. Even on rocky sections and washboard tracks, it doesn’t bounce or twist. If you stand a lot while riding, that alone makes it worth considering.

It’s not cheap, but after using it properly, it feels like one of those pieces of kit you buy once and then forget about because it just works every time.

---

Family came over tonight. Eight of them. Hadn't seen most in eight or more years.

I was doing my best great uncle impression from the couch. Nodding at the right times. Laughing when expected. Staying out of the way.

Then the cracker got pulled.

Adam Dirger and his mum Girde had been arguing about it for ten minutes. Who would hold which end. Who pulled last year. Whether pulling technique even mattered.

It mattered.

*Pop.*

Gerald was already wearing the paper crown.

He stood on the dining table between the bread rolls and someone's unfinished wine. Golden-brown. Glistening. Holding a fortune fish that was still fluttering.

It should have been plastic. It should have been still.

It wasn't.

Adam didn't hesitate. He grabbed a discarded fish from the table — someone had already read theirs, already laughed at the fortune, already forgotten it — and lunged.

Gerald parried.

They circled the gravy boat.

""Does anyone want more sprouts?"" my stepmother asked. No one answered.

Adam swung high. Gerald's fish fluttered left. The blow caught a hanging Christmas ornament. It didn't shatter. It just sort of *sighed* off the tree.

Gerald advanced. Adam retreated through the living room doorway. The coffee table became the high ground. The couch became the trench.

My uncle continued explaining his caravan troubles to no one in particular.

Adam leapt from the coffee table. Full commitment. The kind of swing you make when you've decided the fish knows nothing and you know everything.

Gerald simply wasn't there anymore.

The Lego Hogwarts Express took the blow instead. Bricks scattered across the carpet in what I can only describe as structural disappointment.

The squeakdogs had arrived at some point from beneath the couch. Seventeen of them. Front row. Silent. Watching.

Gerald's fish fluttered once. Twice.

Adam's fish flopped. Dead plastic. Already read.

He knew.

""I was the chosen one.""

He said it from the corner. Robes he wasn't wearing somehow implied by posture alone.

Gerald lowered the fish.

The squeakdogs began cleanup immediately. No instruction. Just... purpose. A red two-by-four to the left pile. A minifig torso recovered from under the radiator.

Gerald provided commentary.

I don't know how. No head. No microphone. But somehow I knew that the squeakdog in position seven had achieved personal best brick-retrieval velocity. It squeaked at me. Twice. Like it expected applause.

The family joined. Dwarf-style.. Eight people who'd been ignoring a fish fight now very concerned about Lego organization.

Gerald looked at the cracker he'd emerged from.

He upulled it.

*Pop.* Reversed. He was inside again. The paper crown, the fortune fish, the whole thing — back where it started. Cracker intact on the table like nothing happened.

Girde picked it up. Looked at it. Put it back down.

The family left all at once. Coats appearing from nowhere. Hugs distributed efficiently. Adam Dirger trailing behind, still processing.

Door closed.

I was alone.

The Lego was in piles now. Not clean, not scattered. Piles.

No worse than when my kids were small.

I constantly forget things she mentions in passing like her ring size, her specific coffee order, or dates of meetings she’s stressed about.

- ​The Vitals: If she mentions a food she craves or a clothing size, I’d text it to a bot immediately to log it.

- ​The ""Hint"" Tracker: I’d set up a system to flag things she mentions so that 3 weeks before her birthday, I get a report of ""everything she hinted at in the last 6 months.""

- ​Conflict Avoidance: I’d even use it to draft texts when I'm annoyed so I don't send something reactive.

*** ​I need advice on the execution:
I know this will help me remember the details, but I worry about the ""clinical"" feel of it.

​For those of you who have bad memories and use tools (notes, calendars, apps) to track your partner's info:

​Do you tell your partner you are using a detailed system, or do you keep it private to preserve the ""magic""?

​Does relying on a tool eventually make the relationship feel like a job, or does it actually help you connect better?

​I want to make sure I'm solving the problem (making her feel heard) without creating a new dynamic where I'm just ""managing"" her data.

I’ve been living here for the past 6 months but will be relocating for work. I’ve come to love this town and wanted to highlight some food establishments that I think either deserves its current recognition or needs more love.

-Juice Unwind:
The jerk chicken bowl was always well seasoned and moist with a great smoky flavor. It comes with 2 sides and costs $18 last time I bought from DoorDash. It was my go-to whenever I felt too lazy to cook.

-Thao’s:
A Lao/Hmong establishment that serves classics like boat noodles (tastes like five-spice), kapoon (coconut curry soup noodles), papaya salad, and sausage with glutinous rice. If you haven’t tried Lao/Hmong before, the papaya salad is pretty hot at the medium setting so try mild first. The flavor profile of the salad is mainly derived from peppers and fish (anchovy) sauce so don’t expect a sweet papaya taste.

-Savor Ice Cream:
Best ice cream in town with classic and monthly rotating flavors. Some favorites included black sesame, maple bacon toffee, eggnog, and candy cane lane. Dairy and non-dairy options are available with the non-dairy base often being coconut milk. I mostly opted for the dairy flavors.

-Aztlan:
Best cheap burritos at or below $10-11 range. Personal favorite was chile verde (stewed pork).

-Chico Chai:
Cafe serving chai and cocoa drinks (my favorite was the seasonal hojicha chai latte) and various sweet or savory toasts.

-Stoble:
Cafe with rustic and modern industrial decor. I liked the Gibraltar (cortado), honey lavender latte, and vanilla latte. Haven’t tried their food options but they had fruit/granola bowls and sandwiches

-New Earth Market (sandwiches):
Local co-op serving hot deli items and sandwiches. My favorite item was “The Buttes” (pesto, chicken, roasted red peppers, tomato, onion, and spring mix on herb focaccia). I also liked picking up the occasional elderberry fish gummies and country loaf when I felt like treating myself.

-Oshio:
Korean classics like soondubu (soft tofu stew), bibimbap, and kimbap to name a few. Two kimbap orders were my fuel of choice when I took an 8-hour licensure exam and needed a quick and easy-to-eat meal.

-Halo Hawaiian:
Hawaiian bbq and poke. I loved their beef combo plate.

-Pho Bonsa:
Hit the spot for pho cravings when I’m not near South Sacramento

-Nama Sake:
Pricey but worth a splurge on special occasions for high quality fish and interesting rolls. I’m more of a nigiri guy so I noticed the noticeable quality in fish compared to another place I tried in Chico.

I know I’m missing out on a lot of other places worth noting so feel free to drop some more recommendations so I can try to hit them up before I move!

Some places still on my to-try list:
-Deja Vu
-Tom-Toms
-Equilateral Coffee
-Sierra Nevada
-The Banshee
-Discovery Bar
-Bodega Pizza
-Mas Amor
-Creekside Cafe & Mercantile

Happy holidays everyone and be safe driving out there!

On the product photos the flat part must be on top, I believe. So I’m holding it upside down on the photo.

  
The grinder is otherwise functional, but I know I’ll just loose the cap at some point. Also I’m sure there’ll be coffee under it at some point, which isn’t great.

I didn’t suddenly become rich, and nothing dramatic happened to my life. 

What changed was quieter than that. Exactly three months into working with an eight figure dollar business, earning $2,500 a month, I managed to save around ₱300,000. I’m sharing this not because the number is impressive, but because of what it represents. It represents a shift in how I see discipline, work, confidence, and money as parts of the same system, not separate goals.

For a long time, I believed that financial stability would come first and discipline would follow. I thought once I earned 6-digits, I would naturally become more organized, more focused, more confident. In reality, it worked in the opposite direction. Money didn’t change me; discipline did. When I started controlling my sleep, my routines, my attention, and how I showed up daily, money simply became a byproduct of that control.

Working hard sounds fucking obvious, but most people misunderstand what it actually looks like. 

It isn’t grinding endlessly or being busy all day. It’s doing the same fundamental things consistently even when no one is watching. It’s finishing fucking tasks properly instead of rushing for praise. It’s showing up when motivation is gone and relying on systems instead. Inabot ko yung 20 hours duty to finished tasks (I wanted to, I'm not forced), water and salt lang for electrolytes and a bite of carbs for energy since I can't eat more than my maintaining calories. Over time, that kind of work rewires how you see yourself. You stop hoping for opportunities and start expecting results because you know you’ve built the capacity to handle them.

What surprised me most is how “elite skills” look when you’re actually practicing them. They’re not glamorous. They’re repetitive, often freaking boring, and very unforgiving. Elite skill isn’t about knowing more tricks; it’s about **executing basics under pressure** without emotional noise. Clear communication, accountability, reliability, and calm decision-making matter far more than talent. High-paying clients don’t look for the loudest or most impressive person. They look for someone predictable, someone who can be trusted to deliver without drama.

Last November, we spent $4M in Advertising. My biggest monthly handled account in my fucking career. One mistake can cost thousands of dollars if not executed perfectly.

2023, my first interview for a VA job, freaking nervous. 2 years later, I'm handling huge account without my hands shaking.

This is where the idea of being “premium” started to make sense to me. Being premium isn’t about charging more or looking successful. It’s an identity you build before anyone pays you for it. When you respect your own time, you naturally respect others’. When you stop overexplaining, people listen more carefully. When you don’t chase validation, your confidence becomes quieter and more stable. That kind of presence is felt immediately, and it changes how people treat you.

Commercial: If you read through here and you're from Baguio. I'll be there this year end. I'm looking for 2-3 people who wants to UpSkill whether technical media buying or foundation in digital marketing with niche in advertising (With Current or Past International Clients Only, Local? Nah. Daming ""Expert"" dyan. LMAO. I want to give back. DMme why you deserve a fucking spot. I'm doing this out of passion, I want my students to learn face to face, I'm allergic to fucking crowd. Let's meet on some coffee shop there for 2-3 hours maybe. There's one thing I'll make sure on the meet. I won't hold back on the knowledge.

Saving ₱300,000 wasn’t really about the money. It was proof that I could delay gratification, manage impulses, and operate with intention. It showed me that I could handle responsibility without self-sabotage. That kind of financial control creates a different kind of confidence. Not the loud, performative kind, but a calm certainty that you’re capable of taking care of yourself. It gives you leverage in decisions and the ability to say no without fear.

Confidence didn’t arrive first. It came as a side effect. It came from keeping promises to myself, watching numbers grow slowly but consistently, and knowing that my work spoke louder than my words. I stopped asking whether I was good enough and started asking whether I was operating at my own standard. That internal shift changed everything. When your focus is on maintaining your standard instead of seeking approval, your actions become cleaner and your decisions more grounded.

What I’ve learned is that finances, discipline, and elite skills are deeply connected. Money doesn’t reward intention or ambition; it rewards structure, consistency, and identity. If you want high-paying clients or better opportunities, it doesn’t start with pricing or confidence tricks. It starts with how you live, how you work, and how you carry responsibility when no one is watching.

Becoming “premium” isn’t about luxury or status. It’s about control over your habits, your time, your emotions, and your decisions. Once you have that, everything else compounds naturally. Money just becomes the scoreboard.

Get your ""Fuck You"" Money.

I am looking for some casual, no strings attached fun - maybe an ongoing FWB situation (or more) if we click and it works for both of us.

I am 41, live near Glasgow but also travel a bit for work - I am in London fairly regularly. I am fairly athletic – I run a lot and cycle a bit, so have a lean runner's build, I am fairly tall - 6'2"", with dark hair and blue eyes. I have some NSFW pics on my profile if you want a sneak preview....

I would really like to get to know someone by chatting for a bit before meeting for a coffee/drink and going from there. Very much looking for someone for both the friends and benefits part - would be great to meet someone I can hang out with and have both SFW and NSFW fun! I met my last girlfriend from a post like this on reddit - I'd love for that to happen again!

As well as running and cycling, I enjoy reading (a bit of fantasy - LOTR, Game of Thrones etc, and historical fiction), watching TV and movies (action, adventure, some sci-fi - Marvel, Star Wars/Star Trek, that sort of stuff). I am also into cars, and a big fan of F1! Would be great to find someone who is also active and has some shared interests.

If any of that appeals to you, drop me a chat with a little bit about you and we can see how we get on. It would be great if you could share a pic too, once the chat request is accepted. I'm really looking forward to hearing from you!",1,1766574419.0,r4r,0,1.0,False

I travelled solo to this beautiful country in the first week of December.

🛂 Visa: E-Visa required (can be obtained easily online in less than a week)
If you have a US/UK visa already then you don’t need one for Georgia explicitly. Since I already had a B1/B2 for US, I could just walk in. Immigration was smooth.

💡If you have an eSIM supported device, use matrix to get an eSIM for Georgia, it’s not very expensive. You get good network throughout.

⚠️ DO NOT accept cab rides from people who are waiting outside the Arrivals in Tbilisi, they’re waiting to scam you. Download the Bolt App, it’s the same as Uber and it’ll get you to the city center in less than 50 GEL(Georgian Lari). To travel in the city using public transport, you can get a metro card (works in the metro, buses and the cable cars) for 2 GEL. 

Most of Georgia is card-friendly but it’s always good to have cash in hand. Use the exchanges outside the airport, they offer you a fairly decent spot rate. 

Coming to the city of Tbilisi, it’s a beautiful walkable city either side of the river Kura. I was in Tbilisi for 3 days, mainly old Tbilisi to explore the local cuisine and its specialty coffee places. I’m a teetotaller but if you drink, Georgian wine is world-famous.

I didn’t want a lot of travel so I had planned my trip accordingly. I had 2 nights planned in Kazbegi, the northern tip of the country close to the Russian border. On the way, I explored Ananauri, the Jvari Monastery and Pasanauri. I recommend staying at least 1 night in Gudauri if you have the time and explore the winter adventure activities. And you should absolutely try the Khinkali in Pasanauri! 

Kazbegi (which constitutes most of the pictures I shared here) was an absolutely beautiful place to be. The weather, the view, everything was mesmerising. I wish I could stay there a bit longer. 

Overall, I had an amazing trip. I only wish the people tried a bit more to communicate in English, but otherwise it was a lovely experience. If you love cats, this country is for you;)

By no means do I think I’m past my addiction but it’s been 3 weeks.

I’ve been on zyn for maybe 5 years, probably around 65mg a day. But I’ve been cold turkey for about 20 days. Haven’t really thought about it, haven’t really had cravings. But here’s the catch - my last zyn was on a flight that I took to another country, and I’ve been there since. I fly back home this weekend, back to my life, work, and living alone (I haven’t been alone at all this trip). All this to say that I’m 100% sure I wouldn’t have been able to do this if not for the trip. It’s unreasonable for someone to just go away for this long randomly but the point might be that you have to break your routine to break the addiction. If it is possible for some of you, could it be worth a 7-10 day trip to get over the initial hurdle? Maybe something to think about.

Now I don’t know what’s going to happen when I return home but I’m optimistic because I feel incredible. I’m less irritated, I’m sleeping better, my bowels and stool have improved, my heart rate is down. I was having issues with my urine and bladder as well where I was only able to hold urine for much shorter period of time than I would like and was having burning issues if coupled with coffee, certain foods, drinking, etc. Even that is all gone. You would think half these things aren’t possible in 20 days and the opposite would be happening especially for irritability and sleep as you’re trying to quit but hand to god I’m experiencing it.

Again I don’t know if I’m just incredibly lucky with my body’s reaction but I’d like to think the trip and routine change is a huge factor. Now we’ll have to see what awaits when I go home ",3,1766573764.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

It sure is awake, loud, judging my walking speed, (for context, I'm from the Coast💀),and has opinions about my coffee choices😅🤷🏽‍♀️

I mean this city doesn't come with a user manual.😒 

You just arrive and immediately start adjusting. To the cold and bipolar weather that wakes up so angry and before you know it, you're dressing down flushed with a firsthand 'overdressing embarrassment'😅. 

The pace?~Oh gosh!  People here walk like they’re permanently late for meetings they secretly hate and have to show up in time lest it reflects on their monthly peanuts🫩 

Everyone here looks busy. Even on a Saturday 😳
Busy doing what? I don’t know. But it feels important.

I’m an ambivert, so I've always been very comfortable doing things solo. At least when I'm feeling introverted. I take myself out. I do enjoy the quiet. I mind my business respectfully... hell, I even have full blown conversations that often end up with 'this is normal right?' 😅

But doing life solo in a new city where you don’t know people or places hits different.
It’s not sad, just… awkward. Okay, maybe a little sad. Especially in the evenings when you realise you don’t have a “who’s free?” text yet.

Evenings are when Nairobi humbles you humorously. That’s when silence starts clearing its throat and asking personal questions like,
“So… who do we call now?”
And you just sit there because even Google Maps is tired of giving you suggestions.

Once the hustle and bustle has buzzed down and you aren't thinking about your colleague's chocking knockoff perfume 🫩, you sit there thinking, “Okay, now what?”
Netflix asks, “Are you still watching?”
Yes. I am ( absent-mindedly) . But emotionally, I’m watching my life choices.

I’m slowly learning that community doesn’t just appear because you moved.
You have to find it. Build it. Or accidentally bump into it at a random place and hope for the best.

Until then, I’m adjusting, laughing at the chaos, occasionally making friends with street cats, and reminding myself: someday, this will make an excellent story ......maybe even with a funny ending (like narrating my experiences at a potluck with my newly found Nairobi buddies~Okay, enough with the imagination😅).......and if nothing else, I'll at least become a pro at getting lost in style.

1pukjc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Traditional-Buy1685/comments/1pukjc0/madurai_to_chennai_a_journey_across_cultures_and/,Madurai to Chennai: A Journey Across Cultures and Landscapes,"Traveling from Madurai to Chennai is like watching Tamil Nadu change its rhythm mile by mile. Madurai begins the journey with its ancient temples, busy streets, and deep-rooted traditions. As you move north, the landscape shifts—fields stretch wide, towns pass quietly, and highways open up. By the time you reach Chennai, the energy is completely different: fast-paced, coastal, and modern. For many travelers, choosing a **Madurai to Chennai Taxi Service** makes this long but rewarding journey far more comfortable, turning hours on the road into a smooth, uninterrupted experience.

# Distance Between Madurai and Chennai

The road distance between Madurai and Chennai is around **460 kilometers**. Depending on traffic and stops, the journey usually takes **8 to 10 hours**. National highways connect the two cities well, making road travel reliable throughout the year. While it’s a long drive, good roads and planned breaks make it manageable—and even enjoyable—for those who prefer traveling at their own pace.

# How to Reach Chennai from Madurai

There are several ways to travel between Madurai and Chennai, each with its own pros and cons.

* **By Road:** This is the most flexible option. The highways are well-maintained, and road travel allows you to control your schedule, breaks, and comfort.
* **By Train:** Trains run frequently between Madurai Junction and Chennai, offering overnight and daytime options. However, fixed timings and station travel can feel limiting.
* **By Flight:** Flights are available and save time, but airport procedures and higher costs don’t always suit everyone.

Because of the distance, many families, professionals, and long-distance travelers prefer a **Cab from Madurai to Chennai**, especially when comfort, privacy, and door-to-door travel matter more than speed.

# What You’ll See Along the Way

One of the underrated parts of this journey is the changing scenery. Leaving Madurai, you pass through agricultural belts, quiet towns, and stretches of open highway. Cities like Trichy or Villupuram often come along the route, offering good spots for food breaks. Temples, roadside eateries, and local tea shops add small moments of character to the drive. It’s a reminder that Tamil Nadu isn’t just about destinations—it’s about everything in between.

# Places to Visit in Chennai

Once you reach Chennai, the city offers a wide mix of culture, history, and coastal life.

**Marina Beach**  
One of the longest urban beaches in the world, Marina Beach is best enjoyed early in the morning or at sunset. It’s lively, open, and deeply connected to the city’s spirit.

**Kapaleeshwarar Temple**  
Located in Mylapore, this temple reflects classic Dravidian architecture and centuries-old traditions. It’s a calm contrast to the city’s busy roads.

**Fort St. George**  
A reminder of Chennai’s colonial past, the fort houses a museum that tells the story of the city’s transformation over time.

**Besant Nagar (Elliot’s Beach)**  
Quieter than Marina, this beach is popular with locals and perfect for an evening walk or coffee by the sea.

**Shopping and Food Streets**  
From T. Nagar’s shopping lanes to street food spots across the city, Chennai offers endless choices for those who like exploring local flavors and markets.

# Why Road Travel Works Well for This Route

The Madurai–Chennai route is long, but road travel gives you freedom. You can start early, stop when needed, and avoid the rush of stations or airports. For elderly travelers, families with children, or those carrying luggage, this flexibility makes a noticeable difference. A **Madurai to Chennai Cab Booking** also allows you to travel overnight or during off-peak hours, depending on what suits you best.

Drivers familiar with the route know where to stop, which stretches move faster, and how to manage long highway drives comfortably. That local experience often matters more than people realize.

# Travel Tips for a Long-Distance Drive

* **Plan your start time:** Early morning or late evening departures help avoid city traffic.
* **Take breaks wisely:** Short stops every few hours help reduce fatigue.
* **Carry essentials:** Water, light snacks, and phone chargers make the journey smoother.
* **Stay flexible:** Traffic near Chennai can vary, so keeping buffer time helps.

Choosing a dependable service is important for such distances. Many travelers quietly rely on operators like *Bharat Taxi* for long road trips, mainly because consistency and experienced driving matter more than anything else on an all-day journey.

The journey from Madurai to Chennai is more than just covering kilometers—it’s a gradual shift from tradition to modern life, from temple towns to coastal city streets. While trains and flights have their place, road travel offers something different: control, comfort, and a chance to truly see the state unfold. Planning your **Madurai to Chennai Taxi Booking** in advance removes last-minute stress and lets you focus on the journey itself. With thoughtful planning and trusted services like *Bharat Taxi*, this long drive becomes less tiring and far more memorable, turning a necessary trip into a calm and steady experience",1,1766572884.0,u_Traditional-Buy1685,0,1.0,False

Day 2 - Post 2 of 7

\------ Brief glimpse of our childhood & our love ------

Timeline & things that happened :-

* **Our Love -** Me & my husband met late in life. It was love at first coffee. Our 1 hour coffee became 7.5 walk + coffee through lovely streets of Jordaan. We knew we had found the one. He became a whole new person - his family & best friends all mentioned it so many times. They still do.
* Before we get married - my husband asked me to **sacrifice my career** in NYC to take care of his mother - And I did it. It made him happy - I love making him happy.
      * I was in EU on a secondment from NYC. I worked my ass off to go to Ivy, build a career. I was not born into privilege. But I gave up my high pay & NYC dream.
      * ***Love has always been the goal of my life*** *- this simple life we lived - full of trust & companionship. Our favorite was driving to a lake with camping burner, a coffee pot, & some coffee. Making coffee by the edge of the silent part of the lake & sipping hot coffee in freezing weather. Some kisses & handholding is a must.* ***THIS was our dream.*** *We lived our dream - briefly.*
      * My husband was grateful he was born in a western EU country - but he was also self-made. We both have never had entitlement. We had to earn everything with hard work and supporting fathers. We were lucky our fathers were intelligent & supportive of our pursuits.
   * **Our trust and childlike innocence** was rare - we both opened up to each other - warts & all. There was no going back from there - just unconditional love & eternal trust in each other. We accepted each other - no judgement. **We liked each other's flaws - my husband always said it makes us interesting**. He told me all about his ex's - the fun skeletons - & I did the same. We had this fun attitude. **An ease of just being.**
   * **Growing up -** My husband grew up in an emotionally cold house. My husband developed introversion because of this judging environment - he never shared any of his girlfriend's with MIL - IN / BIL - R even when he was just 22. He stayed like that with them.
      * MIL - IN (in her own words) was not a motherly mother - she went to work & her husband stayed at home to raise the kids. **I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS.**
      * With the exception of his father. He was the only one whom my husband trusted completely. He was the only one whom my husband asked for advice. He was warm & loving just like my husband - based on tonnes of stories my husband told me.
      * **His dad's passing** \- His dad passed in 2020. That shook my husband. Ever the introvert - he never processed it - until he met me (his words).
      * *Within the first 2 months of us being together, he realized he could be honest in front of me and I will be there. Tears & pain don't scare me. Best lived lives have scars. He told me he could not talk about his father's passing with MIL - IN / BIL - R. He cried in my arms. After that, he finally started smiling like he never had before. I can see it his eyes, in his pictures.*
   * **We were so so happy.** That's a separate story. I will keep that untouched by this horrible episode.
* **Diagnosis** \- My husband was diagnosed of an extremely rare cancer in the summer of 2024. Terminal. No treatments, only chemo to be tried in the country we live in. No specialists. He was misdiagnosed as IBS for 9 months by his careless GP.
* **Right after diagnosis** \- me and my husband are broken & scared. We barely began our beautiful love story - we had only celebrated our first wedding anniversary. We sit in the car and cry. My husband had only cried once before this - when he processed his fathers death with me. We get back home and call his family.

Bit of back story, when me and my partner first got together his family seemed to be amazing and really nice and welcoming, when I got pregnant I was so excited to tell them as they seemed so sweet. We even went out and spend just over £400 on Christmas presents for all of his family that was personalised jewellery saying things like ‘Nan and auntie 2025, fast forward to Christmas Day, it’s important to know that I have a severe autoimmune condition which ever  cold could kill me in the right circumstances, which they all knew, when we got there they had waited until after I had sat down to tell me that two of them were ill (my partners mum and sister) I really struggle with my anxiety so I felt as though I couldn’t say anything or go anywhere so I just sat there. It got round to presents and I was so happy to give them all the presents that I had put so much thought into. There didn’t seem to be a problem they all said thank you and we moved to dinner. At dinner his sister asked why I wasn’t eating, I said I felt sick (morning sickness) and that I don’t really like roast dinner and then she said well why did you even come. That was my first red flag but I brushed it off and then once we went home everything seemed fine but I still felt his sister was being off with me so I spoke with my partner and he said his sister just talks like that so not to worry about it. A couple days later I was working (I worked from home) I received a message from his sister which said that none of his family want me to have my baby and that it was disrespectful for me to get them all jewellery of it saying ‘2025’ when they were already aunties and nans, I was heartbroken when I saw it and just sat there and cried. His sister and me had a heated argument over message although I tried keeping it civil, she on the other hand said a lot of horrible things and told me to get an ab**tion and that his whole family felt that way. I spoke with my partner and told him everything that was said. He went and messaged them all saying it was wrong of them and that they will not be part of our child’s life. Within minutes his mum called him having ago so he went to the next room to talk to her. Once he finished he came in and said that they think we should all meet up and talk about it, I immediately refused to as it had all just happened and I didn’t want to hear anything they had to say, for the next day my partner kept asking so I eventually gave in. We went over to his mums which I didn’t feel comfortable with it in the first place. We all sat down and then they began just coming up with excuses saying that they are just trying to look out for my partner because how his ex and him were. And then the sister that messaged me said in her words “I’m sorry for how I said it but I’m not sorry about what I said” and then his other sister started crying and making it about herself saying it’s because she can’t have children. And his mother was just saying that I was horrible to his sister too, even though the only thing I said was that she was two faced because she acted nice about it once minute and then messaged all of that to me. The whole conversation I was crying and was so uncomfortable I needed up just loving on from it and saying to my partner I would forget about it. Through my pregnancy I barely had any support from them, his sister that made it about herself made a comment on my body. His mum would always talk about my partners ex. It was just a whole nightmare. Move on to when my son was born, it was a very horrible birth I was in hospital for a week as my kidneys went into failure. So my family supported me a lot and got to see our son a lot as they were there to help me. When we eventually got home, my partner wanted his family to meet our son and I didn’t like it I wanted to rest but felt as though I had no choice so they met him. Over the last few months things seemed okay. My partner and I have had a good few arguments because I just can’t trust his family around me or my son because of everything they have done and said. He wants me to get along with them so we can work so I have tried. I messaged one of his sisters and his mum asking if they would like to go pottery painting immediately his sister snapped at me and said what about the other sister that’s unfair for her not to come. But in reality that sister had said so many times she hates crafty stuff and doesn’t enjoy it so I actually messaged her privately asking if she wanted to go for coffee instead. But because of how his sister reacted I immediately just said I’m not doing it I just can’t be bothered with that crap. It’s important to note before I was pregnant that sister that makes it about herself, his mum and my partner and me went to a wedding in their family and at the end of the night his sister kissed him on the lips as a goodbye. Which I hated and I believe she’s in love with him because how she is around him. Fast forward it’s Christmas Eve and I am fuming with my partner, because of last Christmas I told him I don’t feel comfortable seeing his family or even buying them presents, we have still bright them presents but not as much as my family, my nan which was a very big part of my family’s life also passed away a week ago so we are all a little emotional and struggling. My partner has three other children from his ex and he is supposed to see him from Boxing Day for a few days so I said no to seeing half of my family because I didn’t think we would have time, this year we said we would stay at home for the main three days of Christmas and not see anyone as it’s our first Christmas as a family of our own, however his children decided last minute they only want to come for one day and not even stay the night so now we have to fit seeing his family in for them so on Boxing Day we are seeing his family, and on Christmas because we thought we weren’t going to see them until after we said they could pop over to say hello on Christmas Day. But as plans changed and we are supposed to see them Boxing Day I told my partner we don’t need to see them twice but he said that’s unfair because we already made those plans. Because of seeing his family so much I only am seeing not even half of my family on Christmas evening once his family leave I won’t even be able to see my dad or any of my dads side of the family. Am I the asshole for refusing to go to see his mum on Boxing Day to see my dad instead ? ",0,1766572760.0,AITAH,13,0.5,False
