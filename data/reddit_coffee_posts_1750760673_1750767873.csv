So, we just launched a new company called **Local Linc** that helps small businesses promote themselves through **digital screens inside other local businesses** (think: your ad running inside coffee shops, gyms, barbershops, etc.).

Right now, we’re looking for a few Cincinnati businesses to partner with us for our pilot. No catch, no commitments. We just want real feedback from real businesses. We’ll handle the setup, help with your ad creative, and give you free advertising for the entire year as a thank you for being an early partner.

We are primarily looking for brick-and-mortar businesses with foot traffic (coffee shops, salons, gyms, boutiques, etc.) But if your businesses doesn’t see any foot traffic we are still happy to partner and promote you!

1lj9lr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liverpool/comments/1lj9lr3/liverpool_vs_belfast/,Liverpool vs Belfast,"Hi everyone,

I posted a short while ago because was offered an opportunity in Liverpool.

I've since had one become available in Belfast as well.

I'm not asking everyone to choose cities for me or anything, but I know Belfast a little better than Liverpool so I'm just seeing if anyone has an insight into the relative pros and cons of both?

I love Belfast for its friendly people, laid back lifestyle, and the nature which is so close to the city.

I also feel like there's an underlying 'indie arts' type buzz, with a good coffee scene, and trad music too... it feels a little bit 'up and coming' and hipster to me.

I also feel really safe there - even though the sectarianism is still an obvious problem; I'm not involved in any of that so I just ignore it all. There's kind of a 'church culture' there too - which would annoy a lot of people, but I quite like it because it aligns with my worldview in a lot of ways.

I know Liverpool a tiny bit, and was initially drawn to it because I felt the Irish influence, and it feels like a young, vibrant city - bigger than some, but way smaller than London (which is good, imo).

But yeah - I'm just getting a sense of how those two options might compare to each other.

I've seen a few posts on this subreddit about petty crime/teenagers being annoying, too - so I guess I also wondered about that.

Any thoughts or opinions would be gratefully received! :)

Thanks everyone

•How about during rainy days — do sales drop a lot?
 
•And in general, do students still go for the PHP 39 price point, or are they more into other trending drinks now?

1lj9hqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1lj9hqy/feeling_extremely_depressed/,Feeling extremely depressed,"Last month, I got an interview for my dream job. I would use Neville’s teachings to manifest that I had a successful interview and was working in that dream position. I would effortlessly imagine myself in that job, truly feel a sense of happiness and belonging that my life worked out so well. It felt incredibly natural and fun.

Then, I ended up bombing the interview and didn’t receive an offer. I was extremely devastated. A lot of you on here advised me to keep persisting and revise. I’ve done that for weeks and haven’t seen anything. I’m also worried to continue revising and putting myself in that headspace, because the reason the initial rejection was so devastating to me in the first place is because of how heavily I was immersed in the state of having the job in the first place. 

I’ve always wanted to believe the law but never had success, even with small manifestations such as balls, coffee, and fruit. I can’t seem to understand what I’m doing wrong. It seems everyone here has different interpretations of successful people (urgency and desire has the highest success, forgetting and letting go works better, etc.) 

Just reading other success stories, if it were anyone else that immersed themselves like I did, they would have had the desire. So why not me? What am I missing and why have I never been successful? I read Neville and apply his teachings just like you all. Please don’t tell me I don’t, as I truly did shift my internal state before that job interview.

Looking for some advice on navigating a tricky situation at a new job. There's a colleague - let's call them Sam - who isn’t in my immediate team but works closely with us. I haven’t had to interact with Sam for work yet.

When I started, Sam didn’t introduce themselves like the rest of their team did, which I brushed off - some people are shy. But I’ve noticed Sam often looks in my direction. A few times, I've looked up and caught them staring, which makes me uncomfortable.

I've tried initiating small talk, but Sam’s responses are curt, which suggests they’re not interested in chatting - totally fine - but it confuses me given the consistent staring. What’s more confusing is that Sam is friendly and talkative with others, and their whole team is incredibly welcoming and sociable.

Other team members have invited me to join them for lunch or coffee, but I’ve declined, partly because it feels like I might be stepping on Sam’s toes. I’d love to say yes and continue building workplace connections, but this odd dynamic is holding me back.

Would appreciate any advice or strategies. I know I can’t control how Sam acts - just how I respond. Happy to share more context or examples if needed.

we have this machine for about two years now. After a while the milk frother startet to spill water and milk like you can see in the video.

Things I've tried:

* New milk frother. temporary success.
* New valve(?) (this thing: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B082W3WFH6). Applied silicone grease on the o-rings during install. Also temporary success.

Maintenance / cleaning routine:

* Flush the milk frother after every use (menu -> quick clean) and store it in the fride
* Disassemble and clean the milk frother once a week.
* Rinsing the brew unit once a week and let it dry outside the machine
* Clean the interior of the machine once a week with paper towel
* Clean the tray and everything once a week.
* Run the cleaning program with coffee oil remover once a month
* Apply silicone grease (as shown in the manual) every three months
* Clean the water tank once a week
* Replace the water filter as the machine tells me (never overdued)

I used to clean the milk frother by hand. Now I put it in the dishwasher. Didn't really make a difference.

The machine makes around four coffees per day, so nothing crazy.

Let’s be real for a sec

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

So hey, 

I’m 26. I’m a doctor.
And no, I’m not gonna diagnose you unless you sneeze in a really suspicious way and my reflex kicks in.

But I’m not just a guy in a white coat. I’m a certified nerd.
Like, not the aesthetic Tumblr-type nerd. The real kind.
I drop Marvel quotes in casual convos, question what timeline we’re even in, and I’m still lowkey mad at how certain movies messed up basic physics.

I fall in love with characters that don’t even exist.
I get stuck thinking about time, death, consciousness, memory, and whether we’re all just walking collections of nostalgia wrapped in flesh.
Sometimes I sit with chai like I’m the main character in a slow detective story, trying to solve a medical case mixed with a metaphysical crisis.
Other times I disappear into deep dives about marine biology, nanotech, or quantum stuff because my brain said, ""dig deeper bro, we ain't done.""

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a little Arabic (barely survival level).
Oh and I’m learning Klingon. Because why the hell not. Curiosity and chaos kinda are my love languages.

There’s this voice in my head

Not always nice. Not always soft.
But it pushes me.

It says things like:
Think harder.
Fix what’s broken.
Don’t settle.
Show up. Even when no one else does.

That voice keeps me going.
Not for grades. Not for a resume.
But because I need to understand the world. The people. The pain. The purpose.
From nanotech in medicine to how grief rewires the brain… I need to know.
Because surface-level stuff bores me. Always has.


---

So what am I looking for?

Let’s keep it simple. I want someone real.

Not someone who ghosts for a week and shows up with “hey”
Not someone who starts with “wyd” and ends it with “lol”
Not someone chasing aesthetics but scared of actual connection

I want the long weird convos.
The kind that start with memes and end with life, death, and what our childhood still haunts us with.

Someone who can say “I’m not okay today, can we just exist together for a while” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who sends a lyric because it hit too hard.
Someone who smells something and is instantly back in a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs at dumb memes like a gremlin and then goes dead silent thinking about souls, the stars, and why we hurt the people we love.

You don’t have to be perfect. Just human. Just honest. Just... there.


---

But more than anything right now, I want a study buddy

No, not the “we’ll do one Pomodoro and disappear forever” type.
I mean a real one.

You don’t have to be in medicine. You could be studying architecture, poetry, law, quantum physics, or just figuring out your life.
Hell, you could just be healing. That counts too.

I want someone to sit with, even virtually.
We don't have to talk all the time. We just have to exist in the same digital space while we both work on becoming better versions of ourselves.

Picture this:
Late night grind.
Lo-fi or rain sounds in the background.
Cups of coffee or chai.
That quiet presence that feels like a hug.
And every now and then, a break where we drop the dumbest memes or the deepest thoughts.

We keep each other accountable.
We remind each other why we started.
We check in on tough days.
We say, “hey, you got this. you're not alone.”
We don’t need to study the same topic. Just show up with the same fire. That’s it.

Maybe we start a weird little ritual. Like sending a quote before we begin. Or ending the night with a mini trivia game or a stupid challenge.
Doesn’t matter. As long as we’re growing together.


---

Some things I’d love to do with you outside study hours

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re trading pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, alternate realities
Debate which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad British or Russian accents just for laughs
Send 4 a.m. voice notes when life’s too loud to type
Make dumb inside jokes that no one else gets
Build a little digital home made of shared silences and late-night chaos


---

Just a few confessions

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more times than I should admit
Neuroanatomy got interesting for me because of a throwaway Sherlock line
I’ve been broken, badly. But I always show up
I’ve walked alone, but never stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth
I want someone who isn’t afraid to sit in the silence with me, and still feel connected


---

So if you’re

A lil cracked but still showing up
Empathetic but steel-strong inside
Smart but weirdly soft in ways that count
Funny but carrying some quiet heaviness
Brilliant in your own messy, chaotic way

Then maybe, just maybe, this post makes some sense to you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No cool-guy act.
Just me. Tired. Honest. Still hoping.

So if any part of this made your chest feel warm or your brain go “same”, drop a meme, a quote, a song, a thought, anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with study sessions.
Two nerds in different corners of the world.
Showing up. Holding space. Growing stronger.

Together.

Because we’re all just stories.

Let’s make it a damn good one.

Still trying. 

Still here.

Let’s be real for a sec

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

1lj941y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lj941y/1_out_of_5_stars/,1 out of 5 Stars,"If I could give 0 I would. I wasn’t sure where to post this review (which tells you a lot about the level of service in this place to be honest), so I just have to trust Google that it’s taken me to the right site. The fact that I had to make an account to write this is just *insane*.

Melanie is the worst, most incompetent doctor I have ever had the displeasure of knowing. I could go into GREAT detail, but I’ll try to keep it brief:

Firstly, there are no refreshments at her office when you first walk in.

The waiting room is atrociously greige, which should be a crime.

The receptionist only smiled at me for about 2 seconds and then acted like she was doing work, and totally ignored me while I sat there waiting with nothing to do.

My appointment was at 14:00 and I didn’t get called in until 14:06, thus meaning that I was stuck waiting for forty-six minutes with no beverages, no magazines to read, or even a fish tank to look at.

When she finally called me in, I was somewhat taken aback to see that Melanie – I refuse to refer to her as a doctor, because I wouldn’t be surprised if she just made her diploma on Canva – was younger than I’d expected. She had to be 35 max. I was thinking she’d be a grandmotherly type, so this frankly threw me off to begin with, even if she wasn’t terrible to look at.

Melanie was not very polite, but most people aren’t these days, so I tried to grin and bear it. She had to look at my notes to remember my name, and she asked me if I’m on any medication which really ticked me off, because I definitely gave that information when I made the appointment!

But all of this is NOTHING compared to how she treated me during the actual session. I don’t know if it’s even legal to be honest. I noticed when I sat down that there was another woman sitting in on our session, and when I asked if she was a bit too old to be a student, Melanie didn’t find my joke very funny. She didn’t answer my question or explain who the woman was, and I like an idiot, decided to let it go. I’m too trusting and naïve I guess! The woman was old old. Like, should have been in a home old. She sat, staring at me, breathing so loudly I thought maybe she was snoring??

So the session was pretty slow. Melanie asked exactly the same questions that my last therapist asked me, 0/10 for originality. Her office was very bright and fresh looking despite the small window (definitely a fire hazard), and not anything like how a therapist’s office should be. There was no gravitas, no seriousness. I felt like I was in a girl’s apartment. I guess if I was a 20-something loser I would have liked it, but since I’m an actual adult, it just made me uncomfortable.

I could tell she wasn’t a serious person at all and therefore couldn’t take me seriously. Anyone who had let themselves get to her size obviously had no self-control. She was what my mother would have kindly called “fluffy.” It was an absolute joke of a session, especially because of the way the older woman was behaving. She kept making weird sniffing noises, and kind of gulping and licking her lips? It seemed like a twitch or a tick, and I think she may have worse problems than me. Well, actually I know she does.

She was so annoying that I kept getting distracted, and Melanie stopped asking me questions and just sat there, watching me for a while, seeming confused. I tried to be a good sport about it, but I had to ask her to get the woman out of the room if she wanted to continue our session. I want to make it clear that I didn’t make any threats, I just told her how frustrated I was feeling. I was very articulate, explaining that maybe she hadn’t been doing this job for long, and didn’t understand the risks of upsetting new clients.

At that point Melanie said she would deal with the problem right away, and just walked out. My hopes were NOT high. But that changed to concern when I heard the door lock. I barely had time to think about it though, because as soon as it clicked, the truly weird stuff started.

The old woman promptly dropped onto all fours, and SCUTTLED behind the desk. SCUTTLED. LIKE A BUG.

You cannot make this stuff up. I jumped out of my chair and backed towards the door, shouting for help. On the other side I heard Melanie, who sounded way too calm.

“Help is coming, I would ask you to kindly sit down and wait.”

THE. HELL?

I didn’t want to turn my back, so I jiggled the doorhandle behind me. The office had stupidly low light-switches, I guess to make it more “accessible” or something, and I accidentally hit them as I tried to get out. The room went dark.

I heard a shuffling sound as the old woman crawled across the floor, and just about saw her slide from the desk and under the coffee table. I started laughing in spite of myself, because honestly it was pretty funny. She was not graceful at all, and one of her pantyhose was sliding down. She barely fit under there, in fact two of the table legs lifted slightly off the floor as her rear end heaved forward, causing a vase to fall over. The old woman kept wriggling, the table moving side to side like a snail shell, until her face peeked out at me from the dark.

I told the two women on the other side of the door that I didn’t know if this was a prank or a test, but I didn’t give a crap. I just wanted to leave. They told me to remain calm. They said I was hallucinating, and that help would be there soon.

When in the HISTORY of telling people to calm down, has it ever calmed someone down?!

I told the woman under the table that I liked the joke, and asked her to get up because she was starting to embarrass herself. But she was clearly on something or having some kind of hysterical episode, because all she did was look straight at me, and slowly open her mouth.

Her lips stretched until it looked like she was screaming, but no sound came out. She didn’t blink. Then slowly, the mouth stretched into a smile, and she licked her lips again, fingers kneading the blue carpet beneath her like a kitten making biscuits. I found the light-switch and flicked it on, looking away for just a second even though I told myself I wouldn’t. When I looked back, there was no one under the coffee table.

In fact, she wasn’t anywhere to be seen.

I started pooping bricks at that point. I scrabbled around behind my back for the door-handle again, and my fingers closed on something fleshy.

 I have never moved so quickly in my life. I spun around, my whole body cold with shock, and saw…

Nothing. Just the closed door of the office. I wasn’t laughing anymore, I couldn’t really even breathe.

Look, I don’t know how a grandma can move that fast, so all I can say is that she must have been on something really, really strong. Sweat poured down my back and the goosebumps that covered my arms were almost painful. I didn’t know where to look, where to stand. So I jumped up onto the coffee table, and waited there.

I didn’t get ANY help from Melanie, except some platitudes like, “It will be alright, just a few more minutes.” I will admit, I kind of lost it then, and might have said something along the lines of, “I was going to kill her.” I was in a pretty desperate situation to be fair.

I stood on the coffee table for ages, waiting for something to happen. I didn’t see anything, but I could barely make out a ragged breath coming from somewhere in the room.

Eventually it sank in that I wasn’t going to get any help, and I took matters into my hands. I pulled my phone out and called the police, and they said they’d already been dispatched to my location. I told them to bring an exorcist, because this woman was absolutely off her rocker.

Anyway, that was 15 minutes ago, and I decided to bang out this review quickly before they show up. I have a bad feeling that cow is going to blame me for everything somehow, say that I was being disruptive or making threats like the last woman who “helped” me.

I can hear the crazy old bat breathing heavily somewhere nearby, and I have an inkling of where she is, but I don’t want to find out. Because the only place I haven’t looked …is up.

Let’s be real for a sec

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

I don’t think people show up in our lives by mistake.
Some are distractions. Some are detours.
But a few rare ones feel like destinations we didn’t even know we were searching for.
And when they show up, it’s like your soul just whispers, “this. this is what i’ve been missin.”

So hey, 

I’m 26. I’m a doctor.
And no, I’m not gonna diagnose you unless you sneeze in a really suspicious way and my reflex kicks in.

But I’m not just a guy in a white coat. I’m a certified nerd.
Like, not the aesthetic Tumblr-type nerd. The real kind.
I drop Marvel quotes in casual convos, question what timeline we’re even in, and I’m still lowkey mad at how certain movies messed up basic physics.

I fall in love with characters that don’t even exist.
I get stuck thinking about time, death, consciousness, memory, and whether we’re all just walking collections of nostalgia wrapped in flesh.
Sometimes I sit with chai like I’m the main character in a slow detective story, trying to solve a medical case mixed with a metaphysical crisis.
Other times I disappear into deep dives about marine biology, nanotech, or quantum stuff because my brain said, ""dig deeper bro, we ain't done.""

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a little Arabic (barely survival level).
Oh and I’m learning Klingon. Because why the hell not. Curiosity and chaos kinda are my love languages.


---

There’s this voice in my head

Not always nice. Not always soft.
But it pushes me.

It says things like:
Think harder.
Fix what’s broken.
Don’t settle.
Show up. Even when no one else does.

That voice keeps me going.
Not for grades. Not for a resume.
But because I need to understand the world. The people. The pain. The purpose.
From nanotech in medicine to how grief rewires the brain… I need to know.
Because surface-level stuff bores me. Always has.


---

So what am I looking for?

Let’s keep it simple. I want someone real.

Not someone who ghosts for a week and shows up with “hey”
Not someone who starts with “wyd” and ends it with “lol”
Not someone chasing aesthetics but scared of actual connection

I want the long weird convos.
The kind that start with memes and end with life, death, and what our childhood still haunts us with.

Someone who can say “I’m not okay today, can we just exist together for a while” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who sends a lyric because it hit too hard.
Someone who smells something and is instantly back in a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs at dumb memes like a gremlin and then goes dead silent thinking about souls, the stars, and why we hurt the people we love.

You don’t have to be perfect. Just human. Just honest. Just... there.


---

But more than anything right now, I want a study buddy

No, not the “we’ll do one Pomodoro and disappear forever” type.
I mean a real one.

You don’t have to be in medicine. You could be studying architecture, poetry, law, quantum physics, or just figuring out your life.
Hell, you could just be healing. That counts too.

I want someone to sit with, even virtually.
We don't have to talk all the time. We just have to exist in the same digital space while we both work on becoming better versions of ourselves.

Picture this:
Late night grind.
Lo-fi or rain sounds in the background.
Cups of coffee or chai.
That quiet presence that feels like a hug.
And every now and then, a break where we drop the dumbest memes or the deepest thoughts.

We keep each other accountable.
We remind each other why we started.
We check in on tough days.
We say, “hey, you got this. you're not alone.”
We don’t need to study the same topic. Just show up with the same fire. That’s it.

Maybe we start a weird little ritual. Like sending a quote before we begin. Or ending the night with a mini trivia game or a stupid challenge.
Doesn’t matter. As long as we’re growing together.


---

Some things I’d love to do with you outside study hours

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re trading pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, alternate realities
Debate which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad British or Russian accents just for laughs
Send 4 a.m. voice notes when life’s too loud to type
Make dumb inside jokes that no one else gets
Build a little digital home made of shared silences and late-night chaos


---

Just a few confessions

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more times than I should admit
Neuroanatomy got interesting for me because of a throwaway Sherlock line
I’ve been broken, badly. But I always show up
I’ve walked alone, but never stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth
I want someone who isn’t afraid to sit in the silence with me, and still feel connected


---

So if you’re

A lil cracked but still showing up
Empathetic but steel-strong inside
Smart but weirdly soft in ways that count
Funny but carrying some quiet heaviness
Brilliant in your own messy, chaotic way

Then maybe, just maybe, this post makes some sense to you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No cool-guy act.
Just me. Tired. Honest. Still hoping.

So if any part of this made your chest feel warm or your brain go “same”, drop a meme, a quote, a song, a thought, anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with study sessions.
Two nerds in different corners of the world.
Showing up. Holding space. Growing stronger.

Together.

Because we’re all just stories.

Let’s make it a damn good one.

Still trying. 

Still here.

basically im 15 and i have this thing where like im DEEPLY afraid of hearts (the organ) in general, every time even in class i hear anything mentioned about a heart or even a simple beatinf sound i think im dying. it affects my sleep a lot (such as, some nights i literally cant sleep at all if theres ONE sound that sounds similar to a heartbeat like pumping or beating), if i feel any chest pain i would think my heart is like rlly,,,, unhealthy? idk i feel like im having a heart attack which makes me rlly scared. im super afraid of it, sometimes when i have panic attacks i would think its my heart which is 'dying' not like the panic itself through my body yk? i cant drink matcha, coffee, anything with caffeine because once my heart beats it affects me a ton.

sometimes i'll start sweating, feeling dizzy, or just. yeah. stuff like that when i feel palpitations THIS HAPPENS ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. i would think its like skipping a beat so it scares me, i tend to have high levels of anxiety or try to make everything perfect (or keep everything in place i rather just not get anything out of order) in fear that if smth happens my heart will beat and it will cause me to feel extreme fear.

in the present time i really hate this because like it  rlly ruins my life, sports are a big no i do play badminton sometimes but i actively have to take breaks or stop to check my heartbeat, walking sucks i'll check it mid walk esp more embarrassing with my friend around :( (they dont take it seriously and think its stupid). so far nobody in my family has this issue so im sure this isnt genes or some family background, none of my friends experiences this, it just feels like irl its just me who experiences this (which makes it worse bc i feel like im faking it) but anyways im pretty sure i gained this during kindergarten? when we learnt how to check our heartbeat and i got extremely scared, got even worse throughout uhm primary school bc like that few years was when i learnt that oh if your heart stops u die and i got super scared (i fear death as in i dont want the pain nor to cease to exist), and yeah science class rlly messed me up bad with all the stuff about hearts. it also got worse today because i saw smth related to hearts and death on tiktok which caused my heart to beat rlly fast and i had to actually try to calm down for about 20 mins (im still rlly scared btw but its a bit better now...) i try to avoid all thoughts about it as it rlly scares me badly but yeah thats my experience im not looking for a diagnosis maybe just a name or something that can relate to my uh issue? i heard its called cardiophobia but im not sure i dont wanna assume i havent went to the doctors bc 1. no money 2. im scared of doctors

tldr: im 15 and i am deathly afraid of hearts and think any pain to my body is a heart attack, i cannot hear beating sounds otherwise i go into a panic attack (which i mistake as another heart attack but its not after i talked to someone), happened during kindergarten and only gotten worse during the years. dont want a diagnosis just want a name but i heard its cardiophobia but dont wanna assume ^_^",1,1750765912.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

## What is Bit GPT AI?

Bit GPT AI is a **crypto trading platform** that uses artificial intelligence to help users make better trading decisions. It analyzes market trends, price movements, and historical data to suggest trades or even execute them automatically, depending on your settings.

Unlike traditional platforms that leave you to figure everything out on your own, Bit GPT AI claims to do the heavy lifting. The idea is that even if you’re a total newbie, you can start trading crypto assets without needing to become a chart wizard.

It’s part of a growing trend where platforms combine **AI with financial trading**, aiming to make crypto more accessible to the average person. Think of it as having a robo-trader that works 24/7 and doesn’t sleep, eat, or get emotional over market dips.

## Who Created Bit GPT AI?

Here’s where things get a little murky. The **creators of Bit GPT AI haven’t publicly revealed their identities**, which is fairly common in the crypto space but still worth noting. Most of these platforms operate with a team of developers, financial analysts, and AI specialists, but they prefer to stay out of the spotlight.

That said, Bit GPT AI seems to follow the same model as other well-known platforms like **Bitcoin Era** or **Immediate Edge**, which are often backed by experienced teams who’ve worked in fintech or algorithmic trading.

While I would’ve liked more transparency here, the platform’s performance and user feedback seem to speak louder than a team bio page.

## How Does Bit GPT AI Work?

Bit GPT AI uses **machine learning algorithms** trained on massive datasets of market behavior. Essentially, it watches the crypto market constantly, scanning for signals like volume spikes, trend reversals, and price breakouts.

When it detects a potentially profitable opportunity, it can either:

- Alert the user to take action
- Automatically place trades if auto-trading is enabled

This dual-mode functionality is a win. If you're a control freak (like me), you can just use the AI for signals. If you're more hands-off, you can let it do its thing autonomously.

Behind the scenes, Bit GPT AI is crunching numbers, learning from past trades, and updating its strategies in real-time. It’s like having an army of analysts in your pocket—minus the coffee breaks.

## Bit GPT AI Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is flawless. Here’s what stood out to me:

**Pros:**
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Helps users identify profitable trades quickly
- **Beginner-Friendly Interface**: No need for coding or trading experience
- **Demo Account Available**: Practice before risking real money
- **Multiple Assets**: Not just Bitcoin—also supports ETH, LTC, and more
- **Fast Withdrawals**: Most funds processed in under 48 hours

**Cons:**
- **Lack of Transparency**: No public info about the dev team
- **No Official Mobile App (Yet)**: Mobile use is browser-based
- **Requires a $250 Minimum**: Not huge, but still a barrier for some
- **AI Isn’t Perfect**: It’s smart, but can still make losing trades

But they weren’t there. I circled the front. Nothing. Tried the other entrance. Nothing. I even walked into the store holding the cup, but didn’t want to shoplift it into the store trash like some psycho.

her name is Loretta (it's a reference to a song called przekleństwo millhaven / the curse of millhaven) 

she's a robot/AI assistant, made for higher ranked workers to make their life easier

there are multiple copies of her btw

her lore is a big big wip

she can make you coffee, deliver paperwork, clean your desk, set your schedule, google and research stuff for you, and more! she holds most of urbanshade's documents, do you dont have to keep them in their physical form.

she's made to be cold and dry, to prevent workers from growing attached to her. she is also capable of protecting workers from minor threats. for example, she'd be able to take down a wall dweller, but good people would be too much. there would be around 3 versions of her, one for office workers, one for scientists, and one for engineers, each one having different capabilities. oh and she uses voice commands, but she also comes with a remote control in case the microphone inside her breaks or something

she has high security measures because of the information that is stored inside her, so it'd be quite difficult to hack into her, but someone with enough knowledge could do that.

if she was in game, i think it'd be like a keycard room, but theres a seperate room with a glass wall, and the room is blocked off by some rocks or something, with only a small gap left between the rocks. the player would have to use a remote control to move her to a table with the keycard, and make her slide it through the gap (IM SO SORRY IF IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE IDK HOW TO EXPLAIN IT)

[China Critical Minerals Dominance: A Global Overview - The China-Global South Project](https://chinaglobalsouth.com/analysis/chinas-critical-minerals-lead-widens-as-rivals-struggle-to-keep-pace/)

[A worker in the production workshop of a new energy enterprise produces new energy vehicle power battery shell products in Ningde, China, on February 17, 2025. \(Photo by CFOTO \/ NurPhoto \/ NurPhoto via AFP\)](https://preview.redd.it/pzy2b4l9yu8f1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3ab4b0df801df623754012ca629b7ebd810626a)

Despite growing talk of securing alternative supply chains, [China has entrenched itself as the world’s undisputed leader in critical minerals](https://www.ft.com/content/b9a191aa-27ba-41b6-b2b5-0f9b8b40ce8d?shareType=nongift), widening a lead that few anticipated would stretch so far, so fast.

From lithium to nickel to rare earths, China’s dominance across the critical minerals value chain has not only held firm in recent years but has, in fact, expanded. While Western governments call for resilience, diversification, and responsible sourcing, China has consolidated its position at nearly every stage of production, processing, and refining.

Chinese companies are breaking ground, scaling production, and moving quickly on mineral flows that underpin the energy transition, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA)’s [Global Critical Minerals Outlook 2025](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025), released in June. 

In 2024 alone, China, together with Indonesia, [accounted for 90% of global additions to nickel refining capacity, up from 83% in 2020. ](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025)China also controls over 90% of refining capacity for both graphite and rare earth elements, and processes around 60% of global lithium and cobalt. Simply put. 

This means if the world is transitioning to clean energy, it is doing so through supply chains that Beijing commands.

# U.S. and European Alternatives Are Falling Short

Not only does China dominate capacity, but nearly all new investment in refining and processing over the past four years has been concentrated within its borders, as well as in other countries, such as Namibia. 

By contrast, mineral-rich countries in Africa and Latin America, key targets for U.S. and European efforts to diversify supply chains, have made limited progress, mainly due to financing 

>

This growing concentration of power is reshaping international trade and diplomacy. As Beijing imposes tighter export controls on [critical materials such as gallium and heavy rare earths](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/), importing countries are under increasing pressure to reassess their strategies for clean energy, defense, and technology, all of which depend on these resources.

# The Illusion of Diversification

Meanwhile, companies in emerging markets seeking to invest in critical minerals face collapsing margins and uncertain offtakes, a byproduct of China’s massive, state-backed supply expansion that has flooded the market and suppressed prices. For instance, lithium prices have [plummeted over 80% from their 2022 peak](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=For+instance%2C+lithium+prices+have+plummeted+over+80%25+from+their+2022+peak.&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). Nickel, cobalt, and graphite also fell [between 10% and 20% last year.](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ef5e9b70-3374-4caa-ba9d-19c72253bfc4/GlobalCriticalMineralsOutlook2025.pdf) 

https://preview.redd.it/80qsbpyeyu8f1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c1fe99bafda73d2d605efbba3c363cc7bf8606d

Price volatility, rather than spurring competition, is deterring investment in new supply. In 2024, global investment growth in critical minerals [slowed to 5%, down from 14% the previous year.](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ef5e9b70-3374-4caa-ba9d-19c72253bfc4/GlobalCriticalMineralsOutlook2025.pdf)

Behind the headlines, a more sobering reality is taking shape. Diversification in supply chains is not happening at the pace the world needs. 

According to the IEA’s report, new projects outside of China are 50% more expensive to build on average due to Chinese government subsidies, slower to permit, and often lack buyers willing to sign long-term contracts. Even when exploration is successful, supply chain and processing infrastructure are rarely in place.

In fact, these trends, and their consequences, are at the center of the IEA’s Report. The report issues an urgent warning that, without coordinated action, China’s dominance could perpetuate global vulnerabilities for decades to come.

# New Chemistries, Same Dependence

Even promising alternatives come with new dependencies. Sodium-ion and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries may reduce reliance on nickel and cobalt, but they introduce other chokepoints. 

China controls 75% of the global market for purified phosphoric acid, used in LFP batteries, and 95% of high-purity manganese sulfate, a critical component for sodium-ion battery chemistries.

The report also underscores that market forces alone won’t deliver diversification. It proposes a toolbox of solutions, including:

* Public financing and risk-sharing to catalyze private investment.
* Price stabilization mechanisms to reduce investor hesitation.
* International cooperation agreements focused on shared infrastructure, processing capacity, and long-term supply contracts.

# What’s Next: Copper and Beyond

Looking ahead, copper presents another growing concern. 

The IEA forecasts a 30% supply gap by 2035 due to declining ore grades, aging mines, and delayed project approvals. Lithium appears adequately supplied in the short term, but is likely to fall into deficit in the 2030s without sustained new investment.

China is not only ahead—it is widening its lead across all fronts. For countries aiming to build secure, resilient, and sustainable supply chains, moving forward will take more than just rhetoric. It will require capital, coordination, and the political will to break the cycle of dependence.

***\*\*\*\*\*\*\*As the clean energy transition accelerates and competition intensifies for minerals critical to defense and technology, the future of the global economy may depend less on how much lithium or cobalt is produced and more on who controls the ability to refine, process, and market these critical resources.\*\*\*\*\****

# 🧠 Strategic Observations:

* 🔝 **NioCorp** rises to #1 due to its **multi-critical mineral profile**, **proven SX** flowsheet, and ongoing **green process R&D**. \*\*\*\*\*\*
* 🇺🇸 **MP Materials** remains the only current producer with proven scale and fully integrated U.S. magnet ambitions.
* 🧪 **Innovation-heavy projects** like Bear Lodge and Round Top get bumped up due to **early adoption of ligand/membrane/adsorption systems**.
* 🧊 **Greenland-based projects** (Tanbreez, Sarfartoq) are strategically relevant for North America due to **NATO-friendly alignment** and potential processing in North America.

I (20F) was making myself some coffee this morning. I accidentally dropped that metal piece you have to put the ground coffee in and it hit me in the foot. It hurt. It began bruising almost immediately. But I unconsciously supressed the scream you would normally let out in a situation like that. I didn't make any noise, just a slightly sharper inhale, if anything. My mom was in the next room over with the door open and didn't even realize until I showed her the red mark I was getting.

I want to clarify, this isn't exclusive to physical pain, it happens with any kind of discomfort, psychological as well. And I don't think I've always reacted like this, as I've seen pictures of myself as a kid and I was always making big faces. I remember being described as ""sensitive"" and being told my expressions were ""cartoonish"" as well. I was diagnosed right after turning 18, while going through severe burnout that left me unable to do anything for months on end. 

My point is, I think this is some kind of self-defence mechanism, but I want to stop doing it so often, it's exhausting. The problem is, I don't know how to. I guess it comes from masking. For me, things that are usually not an issue for neurotypical people can be more bothersome than what are considered ""real"", socially acceptable problems. For example, I would be more bothered by constant, loud noises than what happened this morning, and I was taught to not react to that, so it logically follows I shouldn't react to something lesser either. 

Since I got diagnosed, I'm trying to express my boundaries and feelings a bit more freely with my family and friends. But I don't get taken seriously at all, because I don't sound genuine enough when I express myself, apparently. I've always thought I made my feelings very apparent, but according to my family, the only way I act differently when I'm upset is that I am a little bit less talkative, and even then, it's barely noticeable. I've been told that my tone and facial expressions are so neutral/casual that it just doesn't register how serious I am for most people, even though my wording is clear. It just doesn't feel serious, and it's usually taken as a poor attempt at humor or a casual complaint/suggestion. 

And then, everyone is taken by surprise when I have a meltdown or hurt myself. Or when I end up burnt out. I guess I don't sound genuine because I'm masking really hard, and I'm trying to unlearn this, but it would take admitting to myself and everyone that I am slightly more affected by autism than I like to pretend I am, and looking visibly disabled. And that's a big step. I would like to learn to express myself like I did as a kid, but in the meantime, does anyone have any suggestions on how to have conversations about this with neurotypical family and friends to help them understand? Or any resources I could use? Thanks in advance!",3,1750765411.0,autism,4,1.0,False
1lj8vyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildHomestead/comments/1lj8vyp/from_beijing_lights_to_cabin_nights_the/,From Beijing Lights to Cabin Nights: The Reinvention of James Alofs,"There was a time when James Alofs looked like he was born to sell cologne or star in a romantic comedy called *Maple Love*. Young James seemed like the kind of guy who had a skincare routine longer than his grocery list. Suits tailored. Mandarin fluent. TV star in China. He didn’t just walk into rooms — he entered them.

Let’s call that the *Peacock Era*.

Flash-forward to today, and James looks like a man who hasn’t seen a hairbrush since the Trudeau administration — and I say that with respect. The guy is out here in the wilderness, building a cabin with nothing but grit, a flannel shirt, and what I can only assume is a Viking ghost whispering ancient wisdom into his ear.

He used to market Procter & Gamble products. Now he probably uses pine sap as deodorant.

He once stood under studio lights. Now it’s northern sunlight or nothing.

He hosted TV shows watched by millions. Now his co-stars are crows and a red oak named Thor — and Clovis, his silent companion.

The best part? He’s *happier*. Or maybe just more *real*. The kind of man who no longer needs applause — just a cold brew, a tractor, and the satisfaction of milling his own lumber.

It’s like watching a well-moisturized butterfly crawl back into its cocoon... and come out as a grizzly with strong opinions on timber framing.

This kind of reinvention doesn’t happen overnight. It takes humility to leave the center stage and learn to be silent. It takes guts to live without filters, applause, or a script.

James Alofs didn’t disappear — he evolved. And somehow, in becoming smaller in the world’s eyes, he became larger in spirit.

There’s something deeply inspiring about a man who once mastered the art of presentation… and now masters the art of presence.

Anyway, I salute you, James. May your flannel stay dry, your coffee stay strong, and your beard continue its noble march toward sentience.

Anyone else notice how different he is now compared to his actor days? Like, in the best possible way.",3,1750765407.0,WildHomestead,0,1.0,False

He was widowed 5 years ago when his wife died of cancer. They have 1 son, now aged around 40, who is married with 2 children. I am long time divorced and have 4 adult children. We are both financially and independently very comfortable.

Adam and I are great friends and truly enjoy one another's company. He is incredibly kind hearted and brims with good nature and happiness.  I am cautious about making things more than a friendship at the moment, so taking things slowly so they evolve (or not) without pressure or expectations. 

Recently Adam asked me to go skiing with him and his family (son, DIL and 2 grand children) to celebrate his birthday and grand child's birthday. I readily accepted but have since found out that his son doesn't feel comfortable with me being there.  We have never met despite suggesting we do so over coffee or dinner. He has claimed meeting me would make him feel very uncomfortable.  

My children, have all met Adam and did so with warmth and enthusiasm and all agree that he is entirely lovely.  I am very sensitive to other's opinions of me and dont want to put myself in a position where the company I am with, would rather I wasnt there. To that end, I suggested to Adam that he celebrates the birthdays without me in attendance and spends his time enjoying his family.  I do find it hurtful that his son isnt interested in meeting me, but more so that he has this notion that his father should stay faithful to his long time deceased wife.  

To me, family is my world, and I would love to welcome Adam's family into my life, but not at the risk of being rejected for being a new love interest in his fathers life.  I am not sure where to take this from here.

1lj8qey,https://i.redd.it/c5ehkuaa0v8f1.png,[Star Trip] – Ch. 1: The Man Who Would Be Commander,"The award ceremony was an exercise in controlled suffocation. Standing at rigid attention on the dais, Commander Stryker Foxx felt the weight of the medals before they were ever pinned to his uniform. Each citation read by President Tsubaki was a ghost, a name he could put to a tactical blunder or a necessary sacrifice.

""...for his pivotal role in the Galactic War... courage, leadership, and excellence...""

The words were noise. Static. Stryker’s focus drifted past the adoring crowd, past the marble columns of the Superior Court, to the impossibly black canvas of space visible through the arched windows. He thought not of the war, but of the Hawking radiation bleeding from a singularity’s edge, of the elegant, violent dance of plasma inside a starship's fusion core. The clean, predictable logic of physics. It was the only scripture he had ever trusted.

His brother’s voice, a phantom echo in his memory, cut through the president’s speech. *Look at you, Stryk. A monument to all our glorious mistakes. Don't let the shiny get in your eyes.*

A faint, bitter smile touched Stryker's lips for a fraction of a second before he locked it down. He had been groomed from a vat to be this—a military asset. A Valiant. His enhancements made him a legend. They also made the crushing fanfare feel like a particularly cruel joke. He was being celebrated for the very thing that was hollowing him out.

""Commander Foxx,"" President Tsubaki finished, his voice booming with manufactured gravitas. ""You are an example for generations to come.""

The room erupted. Cheers and whistles bounced off the vaulted ceiling. Stryker met the storm with a placid, unreadable expression. He was a master of masks. This one was called ""The Hero.""

\*\*\*

# Aboard the UFSS Quantus

Days later, in the relative quiet of the UFSS *Quantus* bridge, three of its senior officers watched the starfield drift by. Their former Captain, Julie Anderson, had been reassigned a week ago. Her absence was a palpable void, a low-grade hum of injustice that vibrated through the ship's decks.

""Any word on the new CO?"" asked Junior Lieutenant Alexis Weiss, Chief Nutrition Officer. She was sprawled in the Captain's chair, long limbs folded like a resting deer, idly plucking a tune on an old acoustic guitar. Her drawl, a cultivated affectation from a childhood spent reading old Earth literature, was absent.

""The manifest just says 'Commander S. Foxx',"" replied Lieutenant Commander Ayame Tsukihara, the ship’s Chief Engineer. She leaned against a console, arms crossed, her expression a study in disdainful neutrality. ""A black file. The kind they give to spooks and celebrity war heroes.""

""Don't sound so thrilled, Ayame,"" said Dr. Cristafiore Solaria, Chief Medical Officer, with a wry smile. She was checking a diagnostic on a secondary screen. ""I hear he's the genuine article. The Hero of Cygnus X-1. The one who held the line at Orion's Gate with nothing but a broken rifle and a bad attitude.""

""He's a Valiant,"" Ayame countered, her voice sharp and precise as a laser scalpel. ""An engineered killer. Forgive me if I don't break out the welcome banner. This ship is a research vessel, not a retired battleship for some decorated jarhead to play Captain on.""

""Maybe he wants a change of pace,"" Alexis offered, her fingers stilling on the strings. ""A quiet tour. Some peace.""

""Peace?"" Ayame snorted, a brief, cutting sound. ""People like him don't know the meaning of the word. They just know how to make it—usually by creating a lot of war first."" She pushed off the console. ""I'm going to the engine room. I'd rather spend my time with a contained fusion reaction than an uncontained ego.""

As she walked toward the HyperLift, Cristafiore called after her, a glint of mischief in her eyes. ""Just try not to dismantle him for parts on your first meeting. Some of us are curious to see if the chrome lives up to the legend.""

Alexis chuckled softly. ""Easy, Cris. Don't let your professional curiosity run wild.""

""Oh, it's always professional,"" Cristafiore replied, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. ""The biology of the Valiant program is... fascinating. One has to admire the engineering.""

\*\*\*

Stryker began his command where any sensible officer would: in the heart of the ship. The engine room of the *Quantus* was a cathedral of power, the central takomak stellarator a pulsing, magnetically contained sun. He bypassed the main floor, taking a maintenance gantry that gave him a direct view of the injector manifold.

He'd been observing the plasma flow metrics for precisely four minutes and seventeen seconds when a voice cut through his concentration.

""The containment field diagnostics are on the secondary console to your left. Unless you're trying to divine the reactor's mood from its color, in which case, I'll save you the time. It's stable.""

He turned. Lieutenant Commander Ayame Tsukihara. She hadn’t raised her voice, yet it carried over the reactor’s thrum with unnerving clarity. She hadn't approached. She’d simply been there, emerging from the shadows of the machinery like she was part of it.

""I was assessing the efficiency of your antimatter injection stream,"" Stryker stated, his tone level, devoid of surprise. ""Your phase modulation is cycling at 98.4% of its theoretical maximum. Impressive, for a civilian refit.""

Ayame’s eyes narrowed slightly. He hadn't been admiring; he'd been auditing. ""The ship received a full systems upgrade at Sigurnia-Five. Including a next-gen neutronium shield weave and a full core re-sleeve. I assume you read the logs."" It wasn't a question. It was a challenge.

""I did,"" Stryker confirmed, stepping off the gantry to stand on the main floor. He was a foot taller than her, a behemoth of muscle and reinforced bone, yet he moved with a quiet economy that was almost unsettling. ""I also read your thesis on optimizing turbulent plasma flows. Your proposal to use nested fractal algorithms for containment field stability was brilliant. They never should have rejected it.""

That stopped her. For a split second, her professional mask cracked. ""You read my graduate thesis?""

""I was bored. It was more interesting than my medal citations."" He gestured back at the reactor. ""Captain Anderson ran a tight ship.""

It was another test. A landmine he’d just acknowledged.

Ayame’s posture became rigid. ""Captain Anderson valued scientific integrity and human life above UFSC protocol. That’s why she’s commanding a waste freighter and you're standing in her engine room."" The words were laced with acid. ""Is that going to be a problem for you, Commander?""

Stryker met her gaze directly. He didn't flinch from her hostility. He simply processed it. ""A commander who inspires that level of loyalty from their Chief Engineer is someone who was doing something right. My only problem, Lieutenant Commander, is understanding how I can live up to that standard. My field is breaking things. Not discovering them.""

The admission was so direct, so utterly devoid of ego, that it disarmed her far more effectively than any show of authority could have. She didn't know what to do with his candor.

""A good start,"" she said after a long silence, ""would be not touching my reactor without permission.""

A flicker of something—humor, perhaps—danced in Stryker's eyes. ""Understood. The same courtesy does not extend to your coffee machine, I hope.""

Ayame almost smiled. ""The replicator is on a public network. Knock yourself out, Commander.""

As he turned to leave, she found herself re-evaluating. He wasn’t a mindless jarhead. He was something else entirely. Something more dangerous.

\*\*\*

His next stop was the medbay. Dr. Cristafiore Solaria was waiting, her demeanor a stark contrast to Ayame’s icy reserve. She was a whirlwind of motion and vibrant energy, her lab coat draped over an outfit that was more suited for a starbase lounge than a sterile examination room.

""Commander Foxx,"" she said, her voice a warm, melodious contralto with a hint of a forgotten accent. ""Welcome to the butcher's shop. Please have a seat. And please, take off your shirt.""

There was a teasing lilt to her words, a well-practiced professional charm that bordered on flirtation. It was a tool, he realized, designed to put patients at ease. He complied without comment, folding his shirt with military precision.

Cristafiore’s easy smile tightened for a moment as she saw him. His torso was a roadmap of violence. Old, pale lines from blades, puckered craters from shrapnel, and the distinctive, starburst pattern of energy weapon burns. One particularly vicious scar bisected his chest, circling a faint, rhythmic blue light under the skin—his secondary, biomechanical heart.

She ran a diagnostic scanner over him, the hum of the device a counterpoint to the thrum of his two hearts. ""Your service record is a testament to the resilience of the human body,"" she remarked, her tone carefully neutral. ""And the many creative ways people have devised to damage it.""

""Damage is temporary,"" he replied, his gaze distant. ""Scars are just old conversations.""

""Some conversations are louder than others,"" she murmured, her fingers lightly tracing the edge of the large scar on his chest. It wasn't a caress; it was a clinical assessment. ""Incendiary round?""

""APE. Armor-piercing-explosive. The armor held. Mostly.""

""Mostly,"" she repeated, shaking her head. ""An optimistic word."" She finished the scan and looked him in the eye. ""Now for the fun part. The psych evaluation. Any feelings of helplessness, worthlessness? Thoughts of self-harm?""

""Negative,"" he answered, the reply rote, automatic.

""Anxiety?""

""Anxiety is a tactical liability. It was… trained out of me.""

""How wonderfully efficient,"" she said, her voice dripping with a soft irony. ""And libido? I have to ask.""

Stryker's jaw tightened infinitesimally. ""Redundant system. Non-essential for mission parameters. Also trained out.""

Cristafiore tilted her head, her professional curiosity piqued. This was the real puzzle of the Valiant program. Not the strength, but the suppression. ""So the legend is an ascetic. It almost feels like a waste of excellent genetic material."" She winked, but the gesture felt like she was testing his programming, looking for a glitch in the code. ""A shame. Stress relief is a vital component of mental and physical health, Commander.""

Stryker didn't rise to the bait. ""Which brings me to my next point, Doctor. I have a request."" He hesitated, and for the first time, a flicker of genuine vulnerability showed through his stoic mask. ""I require assistance with my sleep cycle. Standard sedatives have proven... inadequate.""

The humor vanished from Cristafiore's face. Here, finally, was the crack in the monolith. The hero who saved a quadrant of the galaxy couldn't find peace in the dark.

""Inadequate,"" she repeated softly. ""A familiar complaint in my line of work. Sleep isn’t about sedation, Commander. It's about silence."" She nodded slowly, a thoughtful, almost predatory look in her eyes. ""Don't worry. I'll see what I can brew for you.""

As Stryker left, putting on his shirt and his invisible armor once more, he felt as though he'd survived not an examination, but an interrogation. Each of his new officers was a locked door. Ayame’s was forged from intellectual steel. Cristafiore’s was shrouded in witty, seductive smoke.

This, he realized, was his new mission. Not to command, but to learn. He had to decipher their language if he was ever going to lead them. And it was a language infinitely more complex than any battle plan he had ever devised.

1lj8p8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lj8p8b/do_you_really_believe_some_kids_have_imaginary/,Do you really believe some kids have imaginary friends?,"I know I didn’t. Personally I never had one as a kid and if I’m being honest I never knew anyone that did. My son Christian is 7 and since he was a toddler he has always had a big imagination. From your typical Nerf battles to booking an entire pay-per view for his wrestling action figures, Chris always found a way to keep himself entertained. He really is such a good kid, he always means well. Although Chris is a sweetheart, let’s just say he is a little socially awkward. He struggled making friends, even in preschool he generally kept to himself. So you can imagine my excitement the one day he came home from school and said he made a new friend. I was so proud of him, this was a big step for the little guy. Even though he was only 7 I thought it was great that he finally was getting along with another kid.

Ever since we moved Chris had been struggling even more than normal. Maybe it was the new environment that he wasn’t used to or maybe it was the whole “not fitting in” thing. Hearing crying and sniffling in the middle of the night became the normal for a few weeks. It truly broke my heart. But hearing about this friend Chris made, maybe it would help him to get better. He really did deserve to be happy. We had downsized and moved to a smaller town because I lost my job. My wife Alyssa was now the sole breadwinner. While that was not ideal the best I could do now was to be a good father and husband while I looked for a new job. 

The day Chris came home to tell me about his new friend I was browsing the internet searching for a new job. It had been another unsuccessful search. Chris busted through the front door out of breath. 

“Daddy!! I did it! I made a friend! His name is Richie! He is the coolest! He has this super awesome Yo-yo that he showed me! DAD…I NEED IT FOR CHRISTMAS!!” 

I laughed and said “Alright buddy slow it down it’s only September! But tell me more about this new friend you made.”

“Dad he is so funny, everyone at school loves him and I know you will too!”

“Well DUDE he is gonna have to come by one day so we can all eat pizza and watch some wrestling!”

“OH MY GOSH THAT WILL BE SO AWESOME!!”

Chris excitedly ran to his room and I yelled down the hall “Get started on your homework and let me know if you need any help!” 

I haven’t been this happy in weeks. As a dad and husband you just want your family to be happy. After seeing the look on my son’s face, I couldn’t help but to smile from ear to ear. When my wife came home I couldn’t wait to tell her the news. I know it may not sound like the biggest deal to you but that little boy is our world and seeing him down in the dumps really crushed us. Alyssa was just as excited as I was that Chris seemed like he had finally settled in. She went to his room to hear the news straight from him. I was sitting there eavesdropping when I heard Alyssa yell out “Babe?!” In a worried voice. 

I made my way towards Chris’ room and once I got through the door my wife was pointing at Chris. With a smile on her face she said “Honey, who is this big boy and what has he done with our little baby?!” 

Chris chuckled and said “It’s still me Ma, I just wanna look cool like Richie!” Chris was digging through his closet trying to find his favorite Ninja Turtle sweatshirt.

That night before bed my wife and I shared a look. We were happy, the first time we’ve been happy since we had to move.
We shared a kiss and went to bed.

For the next week or so Chris would come home as happy as can be. He would tell me about what he was learning in school and how Richie was just the “bestest” friend. He would tell me about all the new toys Richie had and how he would let Chris play with them. I told Chris if they ever planned on hanging out outside of school I would need to meet his parents. Chris said he knows that but not to worry because Richie told him his parents said they weren’t allowed to hang outside of school. I thought that was strange but just chalked it up to Richie’s parents being strict. When I mentioned to Alyssa about Richie not being able to hang outside of school she told me not to worry about it. She told me Chris was happy, WE were happy, and things were finally going smooth. She was right, Chris was fitting in and our home life as a family was great because of it.

As the school year went on I did notice something. It was pretty obvious because we were tight on cash, ya know due to the whole “jobless” thing. Chris would come home from school and almost weekly would have some sort of new toy he was playing with. A hot wheels car, Hess truck, airplane, wrestler, basketball. All things we didn’t buy him. Whenever I asked him about it he would always tell me the same thing. “Richie let me borrow it!” While I didn’t think it was necessarily strange for kids to share toys. I did think it was strange that it was almost every week. Where is Richie getting these toys. It was a relatively small town and to my knowledge it wasn’t a particularly wealthy area, so I doubted someone could afford all these toys.

When I brought up the toy situation with Alyssa she did seem a bit concerned. She was wondering the same thing I was. Where were these toys coming from.

“Okay this is gonna sound bad. Do you think Chris is taking these toys from the school or maybe even a student? Is Richie even real?” As the words left my mouth I realize it sounded much worse than what I had imagined. Chris was a bit of a different kid, sure. But he wasn’t a liar. At least I didn’t think so. Maybe I was jumping to conclusions. Take a look from my perspective though. We are hearing all these amazing things about “Richie”. Chris has never once mentioned him coming over, sleeping over, or even going over to Richie’s house. He didn’t talk about any other friends or students. He came home with a different toy almost weekly and always had the same excuse as to how he got it.

Alyssa looked at me with worried eyes. “God, I hope not. Things were finally starting to look up.”

“Well I am going to ask him about it and see what he says.”

As I made my way down the stairs to Chris’ room I thought I heard something. It sounded like muffled talking coming from his room but I couldn’t quite make out what was being said. I stopped in my tracks and thought for a second. What if Chris was struggling so much to fit in he made Richie up. What if Richie is what Chris wants a friend to be. What If Richie is Chris’ imaginary friend. My heart sank. I hoped that wasn’t the case but that would certainly explain some things. The lack of other friends, the fact that Chris never asked if Richie could come over, and now the talking. What if Chris was talking to his imaginary friend. What do I say, what do I do? Will this just be a phase? I didn’t have the answers. Standing around in the hallway wasn’t going to get me any either. I knocked on Chris’ door and walked inside.

“Hey dude, how’s school going?”

“It’s soooo good dad”

“Oh yeah why’s that? Let me guess, Richie?” I said with a forced smile

“Yeah! He is the best! He is always giving me stuff, like these toys!”

“I wanted to ask you about that Chris, are you um, are you sure Richie is giving you these toys?”

“Whatcha mean daddy?”

“Are you taking them from the school maybe? Another kid? You know, just borrowing them of course.”

Chris sat there for a second and seemed to be thinking. “No dad, Richie is giving me these toys. I told you that! What did ya forget or something?” He started giggling.

I smiled at him and thought about how happy he was. I gave him a big hug and left his room. I spent the whole night just thinking to myself, what am I gonna do about this? 

It had been a few days since my little talk with Chris. He hasn’t mentioned Richie any more than usual and he hasn’t come home with any new toys. I had finally had luck with job searching. Funny enough as I was scrolling through endless pages I came across a job listing at Chris’ school. It was for a janitor. I know it doesn’t sound like the most glorious job but I knew any amount of extra income would help. I applied and quickly received an email from the school to set up an interview for the next day. I knew Alyssa would be happy and I figured Chris would be too. Even though I would be working, at least it was at his school where I could see him throughout the day. If I’m being honest a little piece of me was eager to see if “Richie” was in fact a real kid and not some made up imaginary friend. 

I waited on the front porch to meet Chris as he got off the bus. We lived close to the school but just far enough away that he still required a bus. As Chris got off the bus I can see he had his head down. I met him in the street and asked what was wrong. When he looked at me I could tell he had been crying. He hadn’t cried in weeks, it had me worried.

“Chris what happened?! Are you okay?”

“No.”

“Tell me what’s wrong kiddo.”

“It’s Richie dad, he is leaving. He said he was moving and today was his last day.” He said as tears started to stream down his face.

“Oh man, I’m so sorry buddy. Come here.” I hugged him tight. I took his backpack off his shoulders and we continued towards the house. Chris didn’t leave his room for the rest of the night. He didn’t eat dinner. He just cried. When Alyssa came home I broke the news to her. She was upset but had hopes that Chris would be able to make some new friends. 

Alyssa was in the shower when I decided I would go check on Chris and say goodnight. I made my way down the stairs towards his room. I stopped moving when I heard Chris talking. I couldn’t quite make out what he was saying through the door but as I got closer to his room the words became more clear.

“C’mon Richie do you really have to go. We had so much fun. You are my best friend and I really wish you could just stay with me.”

Before I knocked on the door an odd feeling came over me. This all but proved that Richie wasn’t real. Who could he be talking to. He didn’t have a cell phone. Richie wasn’t in the house. I proceeded to knock on his door and enter the room. There was Chris, sitting on his bed, walkie-talkie in hand. Not knowing what else to say I asked him.

“Who are you talking to?”

“Richie, daddy, I was telling him I don’t want him to leave.”

“Richie gave that to you? Richie is real?”

“Richie is my friend dad, of course he is real.”

I took the walkie-talkie from his hand and pressed down the button.

“Hello!.. Who’s there?! … Is this Richie?! …Answer me!”

There was no answer. No noise from whoever had the other walkie talkie. Silence. I proceeded to ask Chris about Richie.

“Richie gave you this? Why? Does he live close by?”

“I dunno, he gave it to me a while ago. We talk on it all the time.”

That must’ve what I heard the other night. Chris was talking to Richie or whoever it was that had the other walkie-talkie. Richie must live close by. He has to be close to have a strong enough signal to talk to Chris. I took the walkie-talkie away from him. I kissed him on the head. Told him I loved him and that I would be taking him to school tomorrow. I didn’t even get to tell him that I was going to hopefully be working at his school. 

The next morning I made some eggs for me and Chris. I asked how he was feeling and he just shrugged. I assumed he was upset about Richie moving and he was angry that I took the walkie-talkie away. Regardless it was time to head to school. Once we parked I grabbed Chris from the backseat. He looked at me strangely.

“Dad whatcha doing? You’re supposed to drop me off.”

“I know bud but today is different! I may get a job at your school, I’m here to talk to your principal! I may become your new janitor! Now I know-“ I was cut off by Chris’ cries. He ran into the school with tears streaming down his face. Did he really not want me to work at the school? Was it embarrassing to have your dad here or was it embarrassing that I may be a janitor? Either way I hurried to the principal’s office, I didn’t want to be late for the interview. I walked into the office right on time and spoke to the secretary. 

“Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Golding. I have an interview today.”

“Ah yes, you must be here for the janitor position that opened up. I’m really gonna miss the old one.” She chuckled. “I really never met a sweeter man. Anyway right this way Mr. Golding is waiting for you inside.”

I walked into the office with my head held high. I needed this job so I was there to impress. Mr. Golding was seated behind the desk but stood up as I walked into. He reached out a hand and I graciously excepted.

“Hello Mr. Golding, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview for this position.”

“Of course Mr. Williams thank you for coming for the interview so quickly. We need to fill the position ASAP. As you can guess a school can get quite messy.” 

“I could only imagine. My son, Chris is a 2nd grader here and he is always making some sort of mess.” 

“If I’m being honest Mr. Williams after looking over your resume you are definitely more than qualified to work here. You seem like a man with a good head on his shoulders, you were punctual, and if I’m being honest because Richard left us so suddenly we are a bit desperate to fill his position. So if you would like it the job is yours!”

A giant smile spread across my face. The tension instantly released from my shoulders. I finally got another job. I was beyond happy. I quickly accepted the job without hesitiation.

“Thank you so much Mr. Golding! I promise you won’t regret this. You don’t understand how badly I needed this job!”

“Mr. Williams welcome aboard! I have the master keys here in this drawer let me just grab them.” Mr. Golding reached into his bottom drawer and pulled out a large set of keys. “Every key is labeled, the Janitor’s equipment is in a supply container in the back of the school. Thank you for taking the job on short notice!”

I couldn’t believe how fast of a process that was. I figured there was going to be at least 1 more interview. The fact that I could start right away was all the more reason to be excited. I looked at the keys in my hand while walking down the hallway and decided I wanted to check out how the previous Janitor kept the equipment. As I approached the supply container I froze in place. In my excitement of getting the job I completely brushed past the fact the Janitor’s name was Richard. This couldn’t be THE Richie that Chris was talking about, could it? No, that didn’t make any sense. It had to be a coincidence. Richard is a common name. Plus this was a school. No way none of the teachers or students didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. As I inserted the key into the lock my hands were shaking. I didn’t do a very good job of convincing myself that a grown man did not befriend my son. I twisted the key and removed the lock. 

What I found inside activated a concoction of feelings in me I had never felt at the same time. Rage, anguish, hate, nervousness, sadness all in one. The walls were lined with Children’s movie posters. Action figures spread about the small coffee table inside. Nerf guns laid on a dusty old couch. That’s when I saw it. A fucking walkie-talkie. The same walkie-talkie that Chris had the night before. Whoever this sick bastard was, was talking to my fucking 7 year old son. Tears started coming down my face like someone had turned on a faucet. I didn’t know what to do. I was frozen in time. I started ripping the place apart. I don’t know if it was out of anger or if I was looking for something specific. I did not care I was just moving. Toys, snacks, candy. What the fuck. The last drawer I opened I truly wish I hadn’t. I was staring down at pictures. Pictures of my son. My son and this sick fuck “Richie”. Taking selfies together like it was some sort of fucked up prom picture. I had to leave. I ran to Chris’ class picked him up and headed straight toward the exit. While holding my crying son, I began to breakdown. Chris whispered in my ear.

“You’ll never be as cool as Richie.”

1lj8ofb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lj8ofb/do_you_really_believe_some_kids_have_imaginary/,Do you really believe some kids have imaginary friends?,"I know I didn’t. Personally I never had one as a kid and if I’m being honest I never knew anyone that did. My son Christian is 7 and since he was a toddler he has always had a big imagination. From your typical Nerf battles to booking an entire pay-per view for his wrestling action figures, Chris always found a way to keep himself entertained. He really is such a good kid, he always means well. Although Chris is a sweetheart, let’s just say he is a little socially awkward. He struggled making friends, even in preschool he generally kept to himself. So you can imagine my excitement the one day he came home from school and said he made a new friend. I was so proud of him, this was a big step for the little guy. Even though he was only 7 I thought it was great that he finally was getting along with another kid.

Ever since we moved Chris had been struggling even more than normal. Maybe it was the new environment that he wasn’t used to or maybe it was the whole “not fitting in” thing. Hearing crying and sniffling in the middle of the night became the normal for a few weeks. It truly broke my heart. But hearing about this friend Chris made, maybe it would help him to get better. He really did deserve to be happy. We had downsized and moved to a smaller town because I lost my job. My wife Alyssa was now the sole breadwinner. While that was not ideal the best I could do now was to be a good father and husband while I looked for a new job. 

The day Chris came home to tell me about his new friend I was browsing the internet searching for a new job. It had been another unsuccessful search. Chris busted through the front door out of breath. 

“Daddy!! I did it! I made a friend! His name is Richie! He is the coolest! He has this super awesome Yo-yo that he showed me! DAD…I NEED IT FOR CHRISTMAS!!” 

I laughed and said “Alright buddy slow it down it’s only September! But tell me more about this new friend you made.”

“Dad he is so funny, everyone at school loves him and I know you will too!”

“Well DUDE he is gonna have to come by one day so we can all eat pizza and watch some wrestling!”

“OH MY GOSH THAT WILL BE SO AWESOME!!”

Chris excitedly ran to his room and I yelled down the hall “Get started on your homework and let me know if you need any help!” 

I haven’t been this happy in weeks. As a dad and husband you just want your family to be happy. After seeing the look on my son’s face, I couldn’t help but to smile from ear to ear. When my wife came home I couldn’t wait to tell her the news. I know it may not sound like the biggest deal to you but that little boy is our world and seeing him down in the dumps really crushed us. Alyssa was just as excited as I was that Chris seemed like he had finally settled in. She went to his room to hear the news straight from him. I was sitting there eavesdropping when I heard Alyssa yell out “Babe?!” In a worried voice. 

I made my way towards Chris’ room and once I got through the door my wife was pointing at Chris. With a smile on her face she said “Honey, who is this big boy and what has he done with our little baby?!” 

Chris chuckled and said “It’s still me Ma, I just wanna look cool like Richie!” Chris was digging through his closet trying to find his favorite Ninja Turtle sweatshirt.

That night before bed my wife and I shared a look. We were happy, the first time we’ve been happy since we had to move.
We shared a kiss and went to bed.

For the next week or so Chris would come home as happy as can be. He would tell me about what he was learning in school and how Richie was just the “bestest” friend. He would tell me about all the new toys Richie had and how he would let Chris play with them. I told Chris if they ever planned on hanging out outside of school I would need to meet his parents. Chris said he knows that but not to worry because Richie told him his parents said they weren’t allowed to hang outside of school. I thought that was strange but just chalked it up to Richie’s parents being strict. When I mentioned to Alyssa about Richie not being able to hang outside of school she told me not to worry about it. She told me Chris was happy, WE were happy, and things were finally going smooth. She was right, Chris was fitting in and our home life as a family was great because of it.

As the school year went on I did notice something. It was pretty obvious because we were tight on cash, ya know due to the whole “jobless” thing. Chris would come home from school and almost weekly would have some sort of new toy he was playing with. A hot wheels car, Hess truck, airplane, wrestler, basketball. All things we didn’t buy him. Whenever I asked him about it he would always tell me the same thing. “Richie let me borrow it!” While I didn’t think it was necessarily strange for kids to share toys. I did think it was strange that it was almost every week. Where is Richie getting these toys. It was a relatively small town and to my knowledge it wasn’t a particularly wealthy area, so I doubted someone could afford all these toys.

When I brought up the toy situation with Alyssa she did seem a bit concerned. She was wondering the same thing I was. Where were these toys coming from.

So I run a small online stationery store—mostly journals, cute pens, stickers, packaging stuff—and I get most of my inventory from Alibaba. It’s been a solid way to get started without breaking the bank, but I keep running into the same mental block: how the heck do you compete with giants like Amazon or Vistaprint?

Like, I know I can’t beat them on price or shipping speed. That’s just reality. But I’m wondering what actually *works* when you’re a small shop trying to stand out. Is it better to go super niche—like focusing only on bullet journaling or wedding-related stationery? Or does it make more sense to push personalized items, where you can offer something the big guys don’t?

I’ve also been thinking about doing more local marketing—pop-ups, small business fairs, maybe collabs with local artists or coffee shops. I just don’t want to waste a ton of time or money chasing the wrong angle.

For anyone else in the same boat (especially if you’re also sourcing from Alibaba), how are you carving out space in such a crowded market? Are niche products actually paying off for you? Or is it more about brand storytelling and community vibes?

Really appreciate any thoughts or ideas you’ve tried. Trying to keep the hustle going without getting totally swallowed up by Amazon Prime Day 😅",1,1750764640.0,ecommerce,3,0.67,False

**Title should be 2 adults and 1 child.**

**Note: this was long so i uploaded my grocery receipts as images instead of listing all the items i bought but then they didn't post. imgur link** [**https://imgur.com/a/kyMFxrb**](https://imgur.com/a/kyMFxrb)

*How many people are you feeding, HHI, Cost of living for the area.*

Feeding 2 adults and 1 child. DH eats breakfast and lunch at work. this is subsidised but not free. he pays for this out of his own funds so i don't count it as part of the grocery budget. Small child gets a packed lunch for school. their Childminder also give morning snacks before school and after school snacks. we pay €5 per week for this.

Ireland is a relatively high cost of living country but i think grocery prices are lowish, though they have increased massively in the last year. Combined we make €170k and after taxes and deductions (pensions etc) this averages at about €8.4K per month. Our grocery budget was €500 and we have an eating out budget of €150. this was generous up until recently but is now often now not enough.

*How many meals do you typically prepare at home in a week?*

Typically i make the majority of our meals. We can't get food delivered here as we live in the countryside so if we want a takeaway we have to pick it up. Days i'm in the office i will generally get tea and sometimes lunch.

*Do you have any dietary requirements or goals?*

None, just a fussy child.

*What's your most loved kitchen appliance/gadget?*

I'm going to go with the freezers. So handy for bulk buying and garden produce.

*What are your top three places to buy groceries?*

Lidl, Tesco and the local shop which is a centra. We are very lucky that even generic meat and dairy products are of excellent quality. For example all regular butter in Ireland is the equivalent of Kerrygold.

*Bonus question: How well-stocked is your house food-wise*?

Very well stocked. I have 3 freezers (slightly accidentally as the house we bought had a tiny under counter fridge and freezer. We already owned a small chest freezer but wanted a large one for our garage. If the undercounter freezer broke i would not replace it. Same with the undercounter fridge which we only use for drinks. I also like to keep a back up pantry of at least one replacement of things we use often.

🧾 Weekly Spending Summary

This was an interesting 2 weeks, we will actually be on track with the budget of €500 as we were on holidays for 8 days and didn't grocery shop then. This month was a stock up the freezers month as i was out of most meats. Next month i will do a stock up in our local restaurant supply store where i buy frozen berries, BBQ items (sausages and burgers) and part baked bakery products. Overall these 2 weeks had a lot of toast as we adjusted to being back from holiday. Snacks do get more varied as we re adjust.

1lj8m5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossMedsUK/comments/1lj8m5i/hair_loss/,Hair loss,"This is quite a hard post to write as I have found this the absolute worst part of my weight loss journey. I started over 12 months ago and have lost just over 4 stone, I am am slow loser but happy wiith that as my skin is shrinking with me. About 3 months in, I notoced a lot of hair in the plughole when I washed my hair. Then I noticed that when I brushed it the hairbrush was full of hair, eventually every time I touched my hair I was aware that more of it was falling out at the root. This was really worrying and also upsetting, I was seriously concerned that it was all going to fall out and I would have none left. I spoke to my hairdresser and she said rather than it being the meds, it's just a reaction some people get who lose a lot of weight in a short amount of time. This made me feel a bit better and she said to try not to worry and that it would grow back. In all honestly I did lose sleep over my hair, some times it was literally handfuls falling out when I washed it. Even my husband noticed. I did some reading and decided to increase the amount of protein I was eating and also took some extra suppliments. I added collegen to my diet too, in the form of flavourless sachets which I added to my coffee in the morning. I can't remember the name of the hair suppliments I bought but they contain biotin and are in a purple box. I will look and add the name later if anyone is interested. Anyway the point of this post is to say that aboit 4 months ago my hair started to grow back, me and my hairdresser noticed baby hair and now it is getting thicker again. Overall I think I lost around 1/4 - 1/3 of my hair and the point of this post is to reassure anyone going through this that it will grow back. I have put before and after photos on. I hope this is useful.

1lj8kvh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lj8kvh,"Reminiscing. 0ne year ago. A great stage five, three pub day. Tyndrum to Inveroran.","Up early and prepositioned one of the cars at Inveroran. Back to our accommodation to leave the other car for our wives and breakfast at the Real Food Cafe.

We grabbed a sandwich and some fruit from the Green Welly and we were off. We crossed the little bridge across the railway line and we got the longest view of the trail ahead that we had so far. The first train to pass us was The Caledonian Sleeper to Fort William.

We could see Bienn Dorain, but not really recognise it as it was clagged in. Got a sprinkle of rain at the first underpass and copped another twenty minutes or so approaching Bridge of Orchy. Not too many people on trail today.

Got to the Bridge of Orchy Hotel at 1040am, twenty minutes before the bar opened. Got our passports stamped at reception, and went into the bar. The barman was chatty and took our orders, promising to bring our beers when it was legal to do so.

We checked the food menu and the barman, recognising our accents offered to make us a ‘real Aussie egg and bacon roll’. We took him at his word and sat outside on the back verandah. A few minutes before 1100am our pints arrived followed moments later by our egg and bacon rolls. They included onions and cheese, which isn’t really Aussie, but with fried eggs, freshly cooked bacon and lashings of BBQ sauce they were sure better than the standard British ‘bacon sandwich’.

While we sat on the verandah, we watched coloured jackets and backpacks ascend the hill and we were able to plot the course we would soon be taking. The recently logged hill made it easy to see. The mist came down and rose again while we were sitting there.

As we were about to leave, the barman came out with two more pints. Accidental mispours apparently. It pays to be nice to service staff.

A fairly easy climb up ‘the esses’. Getting rained on for the last five minutes. A rest at the cairn on the peak. We ate our lunch while chatting with a large group of young German and Swiss hikers.

After a careful descent down the hill along a trail that resembled a stream we arrived at Inveroran. An energy boosting chocolate from the shop, a passport stamp and into the hotel. I had a pint, but my mate was driving so he was restricted to coffee and cake. In the small bar we met a ‘couple without an accent’ (fellow Aussies), some Canadians, Kiwis and some Russians. None of them hikers, they were hotel guests.

What about the third pub you ask? The Tyndrum Inn. When we got back to our accommodation the wives were missing. They had gone back to Onan as they enjoyed it yesterday.

Hi everyone I am  the author boyfriend I haven’t talked to her since yesterday she didn’t return my calls or text so. I drove over and found the door unlocked I walked in and found her laptop open on the coffee table. She doesn’t have any secrets so she doesn’t have a pass word. I woke up the laptop and this page came up does anyone on here now if this is her only post? She never told me this story. The white church is in the middle of the county where we don’t get much trouble. 

I don’t usually patrol up there but hey looks like I am going for a road trip. I called the hospital she works at they said that she took 3 days of PTO. Hopefully this isn’t over the fight we had. See my Georgia peach is actually not from this shit hole state she from the beutiful snake filled sweat pit of Georgia. I meet her after I got stitched up after an arrest of a drunk d1 college rugby girl. Those creatures scratch her southern ascent had me hooked. I asked her for a date she turned me down seeing I am well known with the  ER nurses. 

Well a week later delta dawn got her BMW stuck in a ditch. Seeing she never drove in a lake effect storm before. I drove her to work in my patrol vehicle and took her back to her place  after work. Where she made me coffee and stole my heart with a homemade pitch cobbler that night and we have been steady ever since. After reading her story it looks like she might’ve  got herself in some trouble. I wonder it might be her past coming for her well those southern don’t realize how unkind us New Yorkers.

I know I didn’t. Personally I never had one as a kid and if I’m being honest I never knew anyone that did. My son Christian is 7 and since he was a toddler he has always had a big imagination. From your typical Nerf battles to booking an entire pay-per view for his wrestling action figures, Chris always found a way to keep himself entertained. He really is such a good kid, he always means well. Although Chris is a sweetheart, let’s just say he is a little socially awkward. He struggled making friends, even in preschool he generally kept to himself. So you can imagine my excitement the one day he came home from school and said he made a new friend. I was so proud of him, this was a big step for the little guy. Even though he was only 7 I thought it was great that he finally was getting along with another kid. 



Ever since we moved Chris had been struggling even more than normal. Maybe it was the new environment that he wasn’t used to or maybe it was the whole “not fitting in” thing. Hearing crying and sniffling in the middle of the night became the normal for a few weeks. It truly broke my heart. But hearing about this friend Chris made, maybe it would help him to get better. He really did deserve to be happy. We had downsized and moved to a smaller town because I lost my job. My wife Alyssa was now the sole breadwinner. While that was not ideal the best I could do now was to be a good father and husband while I looked for a new job. 



The day Chris came home to tell me about his new friend I was browsing the internet searching for a new job. It had been another unsuccessful search. Chris busted through the front door out of breath. 



“Daddy!! I did it! I made a friend! His name is Richie! He is the coolest! He has this super awesome Yo-yo that he showed me! DAD…I NEED IT FOR CHRISTMAS!!” 



I laughed and said “Alright buddy slow it down it’s only September! But tell me more about this new friend you made.”



“Dad he is so funny, everyone at school loves him and I know you will too!”



“Well DUDE he is gonna have to come by one day so we can all eat pizza and watch some wrestling!”



“OH MY GOSH THAT WILL BE SO AWESOME!!”



Chris excitedly ran to his room and I yelled down the hall “Get started on your homework and let me know if you need any help!” 



I haven’t been this happy in weeks. As a dad and husband you just want your family to be happy. After seeing the look on my son’s face, I couldn’t help but to smile from ear to ear. When my wife came home I couldn’t wait to tell her the news. I know it may not sound like the biggest deal to you but that little boy is our world and seeing him down in the dumps really crushed us. Alyssa was just as excited as I was that Chris seemed like he had finally settled in. She went to his room to hear the news straight from him. I was sitting there eavesdropping when I heard Alyssa yell out “Babe?!” In a worried voice. 



I made my way towards Chris’ room and once I got through the door my wife was pointing at Chris. With a smile on her face she said “Honey, who is this big boy and what has he done with our little baby?!” 



Chris chuckled and said “It’s still me Ma, I just wanna look cool like Richie!” Chris was digging through his closet trying to find his favorite Ninja Turtle sweatshirt.



That night before bed my wife and I shared a look. We were happy, the first time we’ve been happy since we had to move.

We shared a kiss and went to bed.



For the next week or so Chris would come home as happy as can be. He would tell me about what he was learning in school and how Richie was just the “bestest” friend. He would tell me about all the new toys Richie had and how he would let Chris play with them. I told Chris if they ever planned on hanging out outside of school I would need to meet his parents. Chris said he knows that but not to worry because Richie told him his parents said they weren’t allowed to hang outside of school. I thought that was strange but just chalked it up to Richie’s parents being strict. When I mentioned to Alyssa about Richie not being able to hang outside of school she told me not to worry about it. She told me Chris was happy, WE were happy, and things were finally going smooth. She was right, Chris was fitting in and our home life as a family was great because of it.



As the school year went on I did notice something. It was pretty obvious because we were tight on cash, ya know due to the whole “jobless” thing. Chris would come home from school and almost weekly would have some sort of new toy he was playing with. A hot wheels car, Hess truck, airplane, wrestler, basketball. All things we didn’t buy him. Whenever I asked him about it he would always tell me the same thing. “Richie let me borrow it!” While I didn’t think it was necessarily strange for kids to share toys. I did think it was strange that it was almost every week. Where is Richie getting these toys. It was a relatively small town and to my knowledge it wasn’t a particularly wealthy area, so I doubted someone could afford all these toys.



When I brought up the toy situation with Alyssa she did seem a bit concerned. She was wondering the same thing I was. Where were these toys coming from.



“Okay this is gonna sound bad. Do you think Chris is taking these toys from the school or maybe even a student? Is Richie even real?” As the words left my mouth I realize it sounded much worse than what I had imagined. Chris was a bit of a different kid, sure. But he wasn’t a liar. At least I didn’t think so. Maybe I was jumping to conclusions. Take a look from my perspective though. We are hearing all these amazing things about “Richie”. Chris has never once mentioned him coming over, sleeping over, or even going over to Richie’s house. He didn’t talk about any other friends or students. He came home with a different toy almost weekly and always had the same excuse as to how he got it.



Alyssa looked at me with worried eyes. “God, I hope not. Things were finally starting to look up.”



“Well I am going to ask him about it and see what he says.”



As I made my way down the stairs to Chris’ room I thought I heard something. It sounded like muffled talking coming from his room but I couldn’t quite make out what was being said. I stopped in my tracks and thought for a second. What if Chris was struggling so much to fit in he made Richie up. What if Richie is what Chris wants a friend to be. What If Richie is Chris’ imaginary friend. My heart sank. I hoped that wasn’t the case but that would certainly explain some things. The lack of other friends, the fact that Chris never asked if Richie could come over, and now the talking. What if Chris was talking to his imaginary friend. What do I say, what do I do? Will this just be a phase? I didn’t have the answers. Standing around in the hallway wasn’t going to get me any either. I knocked on Chris’ door and walked inside.



“Hey dude, how’s school going?”



“It’s soooo good dad”



“Oh yeah why’s that? Let me guess, Richie?” I said with a forced smile



“Yeah! He is the best! He is always giving me stuff, like these toys!”



“I wanted to ask you about that Chris, are you um, are you sure Richie is giving you these toys?”



“Whatcha mean daddy?”



“Are you taking them from the school maybe? Another kid? You know, just borrowing them of course.”



Chris sat there for a second and seemed to be thinking. “No dad, Richie is giving me these toys. I told you that! What did ya forget or something?” He started giggling.



I smiled at him and thought about how happy he was. I gave him a big hug and left his room. I spent the whole night just thinking to myself, what am I gonna do about this? 



It had been a few days since my little talk with Chris. He hasn’t mentioned Richie any more than usual and he hasn’t come home with any new toys. I had finally had luck with job searching. Funny enough as I was scrolling through endless pages I came across a job listing at Chris’ school. It was for a janitor. I know it doesn’t sound like the most glorious job but I knew any amount of extra income would help. I applied and quickly received an email from the school to set up an interview for the next day. I knew Alyssa would be happy and I figured Chris would be too. Even though I would be working, at least it was at his school where I could see him throughout the day. If I’m being honest a little piece of me was eager to see if “Richie” was in fact a real kid and not some made up imaginary friend. 



I waited on the front porch to meet Chris as he got off the bus. We lived close to the school but just far enough away that he still required a bus. As Chris got off the bus I can see he had his head down. I met him in the street and asked what was wrong. When he looked at me I could tell he had been crying. He hadn’t cried in weeks, it had me worried.



“Chris what happened?! Are you okay?”



“No.”



“Tell me what’s wrong kiddo.”



“It’s Richie dad, he is leaving. He said he was moving and today was his last day.” He said as tears started to stream down his face.



“Oh man, I’m so sorry buddy. Come here.” I hugged him tight. I took his backpack off his shoulders and we continued towards the house. Chris didn’t leave his room for the rest of the night. He didn’t eat dinner. He just cried. When Alyssa came home I broke the news to her. She was upset but had hopes that Chris would be able to make some new friends. 



Alyssa was in the shower when I decided I would go check on Chris and say goodnight. I made my way down the stairs towards his room. I stopped moving when I heard Chris talking. I couldn’t quite make out what he was saying through the door but as I got closer to his room the words became more clear.



“C’mon Richie do you really have to go. We had so much fun. You are my best friend and I really wish you could just stay with me.”



Before I knocked on the door an odd feeling came over me. This all but proved that Richie wasn’t real. Who could he be talking to. He didn’t have a cell phone. Richie wasn’t in the house. I proceeded to knock on his door and enter the room. There was Chris, sitting on his bed, walkie-talkie in hand. Not knowing what else to say I asked him.



“Who are you talking to?”



“Richie, daddy, I was telling him I don’t want him to leave.”



“Richie gave that to you? Richie is real?”



“Richie is my friend dad, of course he is real.”



I took the walkie-talkie from his hand and pressed down the button.



“Hello!.. Who’s there?! … Is this Richie?! …Answer me!”



There was no answer. No noise from whoever had the other walkie talkie. Silence. I proceeded to ask Chris about Richie.



“Richie gave you this? Why? Does he live close by?”



“I dunno, he gave it to me a while ago. We talk on it all the time.”



That must’ve what I heard the other night. Chris was talking to Richie or whoever it was that had the other walkie-talkie. Richie must live close by. He has to be close to have a strong enough signal to talk to Chris. I took the walkie-talkie away from him. I kissed him on the head. Told him I loved him and that I would be taking him to school tomorrow. I didn’t even get to tell him that I was going to hopefully be working at his school. 



The next morning I made some eggs for me and Chris. I asked how he was feeling and he just shrugged. I assumed he was upset about Richie moving and he was angry that I took the walkie-talkie away. Regardless it was time to head to school. Once we parked I grabbed Chris from the backseat. He looked at me strangely.



“Dad whatcha doing? You’re supposed to drop me off.”



“I know bud but today is different! I may get a job at your school, I’m here to talk to your principal! I may become your new janitor! Now I know-“ I was cut off by Chris’ cries. He ran into the school with tears streaming down his face. Did he really not want me to work at the school? Was it embarrassing to have your dad here or was it embarrassing that I may be a janitor? Either way I hurried to the principal’s office, I didn’t want to be late for the interview. I walked into the office right on time and spoke to the secretary. 



“Hello, I’m here to see Mr. Golding. I have an interview today.”



“Ah yes, you must be here for the janitor position that opened up. I’m really gonna miss the old one.” She chuckled. “I really never met a sweeter man. Anyway right this way Mr. Golding is waiting for you inside.”



I walked into the office with my head held high. I needed this job so I was there to impress. Mr. Golding was seated behind the desk but stood up as I walked into. He reached out a hand and I graciously excepted.



“Hello Mr. Golding, it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview for this position.”



“Of course Mr. Williams thank you for coming for the interview so quickly. We need to fill the position ASAP. As you can guess a school can get quite messy.” 



“I could only imagine. My son, Chris is a 2nd grader here and he is always making some sort of mess.” 



“If I’m being honest Mr. Williams after looking over your resume you are definitely more than qualified to work here. You seem like a man with a good head on his shoulders, you were punctual, and if I’m being honest because Richard left us so suddenly we are a bit desperate to fill his position. So if you would like it the job is yours!”



A giant smile spread across my face. The tension instantly released from my shoulders. I finally got another job. I was beyond happy. I quickly accepted the job without hesitiation.



“Thank you so much Mr. Golding! I promise you won’t regret this. You don’t understand how badly I needed this job!”



“Mr. Williams welcome aboard! I have the master keys here in this drawer let me just grab them.” Mr. Golding reached into his bottom drawer and pulled out a large set of keys. “Every key is labeled, the Janitor’s equipment is in a supply container in the back of the school. Thank you for taking the job on short notice!”



I couldn’t believe how fast of a process that was. I figured there was going to be at least 1 more interview. The fact that I could start right away was all the more reason to be excited. I looked at the keys in my hand while walking down the hallway and decided I wanted to check out how the previous Janitor kept the equipment. As I approached the supply container I froze in place. In my excitement of getting the job I completely brushed past the fact the Janitor’s name was Richard. This couldn’t be THE Richie that Chris was talking about, could it? No, that didn’t make any sense. It had to be a coincidence. Richard is a common name. Plus this was a school. No way none of the teachers or students didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. As I inserted the key into the lock my hands were shaking. I didn’t do a very good job of convincing myself that a grown man did not befriend my son. I twisted the key and removed the lock. 



What I found inside activated a concoction of feelings in me I had never felt at the same time. Rage, anguish, hate, nervousness, sadness all in one. The walls were lined with Children’s movie posters. Action figures spread about the small coffee table inside. Nerf guns laid on a dusty old couch. That’s when I saw it. A fucking walkie-talkie. The same walkie-talkie that Chris had the night before. Whoever this sick bastard was, was talking to my fucking 7 year old son. Tears started coming down my face like someone had turned on a faucet. I didn’t know what to do. I was frozen in time. I started ripping the place apart. I don’t know if it was out of anger or if I was looking for something specific. I did not care I was just moving. Toys, snacks, candy. What the fuck. The last drawer I opened I truly wish I hadn’t. I was staring down at pictures. Pictures of my son. My son and this sick fuck “Richie”. Taking selfies together like it was some sort of fucked up prom picture. I had to leave. I ran to Chris’ class picked him up and headed straight toward the exit. While holding my crying son, I began to breakdown. Chris whispered in my ear.



“You’ll never be as cool as Richie.”

Faceless Growth Strategies You NEED to Try Before 2025 🤫💰","**Ditch the Face, Double the Revenue? Faceless Growth Strategies You NEED to Try Before 2025 🤫💰**

Okay, friends, let’s talk about something that’s been buzzing around my mind lately. Have you ever thought that maybe, just *maybe*, putting your face out there isn’t the only way to grow your business? 🤔 Yeah, I know it sounds a little crazy—like saying the sky is green. But hear me out! 

You don’t need a full-on personal brand to rake in that dough. Believe me, some of the most incredible success stories you’ll ever hear come from folks who just let their work speak for itself. 

Here are a few faceless growth strategies that could totally level up your game before we hit that 2025 milestone:

1. **Content Automation:** I mean, c’mon, who doesn’t love a good efficient workflow? AI has your back. Tools like [this helpful guide](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) can help you create content without breaking a sweat. Imagine generating quality articles while you chill with a cup of coffee. 🙌

2. **Podcasting Without the Face:** There are tons of successful podcasters who barely show themselves online. You know what they focus on? Great content! Pick a niche, and share those mind-blowing stories or insights. The mic doesn’t care if you’re wearing pajama pants. 🎤

3. **Affiliate Marketing:** If you find the right products or programs to promote, you can earn passive income in your sleep. It’s like pulling a heist but without the masks…well, aside from the ones you wear in your Zoom calls! 🥷💰

4. **YouTube Animations:** Don't feel like being on camera? Create animated videos instead. There are loads of software and tools out there that make it easy. Plus, who doesn't love a well-made cartoon? If kids love it, so can adults!

5. **Email Newsletters:** Get personal with your subscribers without needing to show your face. Share valuable insights, tips, or experiences while staying behind the curtain. It’s all about connection, not necessarily visibility.

6. **User-Generated Content (UGC):** Encourage your users or customers to create content related to your product. Not only does this build community, but it takes the pressure off you to be “the face” of your brand.

Now, here's the kicker: when we think about growth, it's crucial to remember that authenticity and value trump flashy personas every time. 🏆 

And isn't it so much easier to let your work shine while sipping on your favorite drink, unseen by the world? 

So here’s a thought to chew on: What if we embrace our hidden potential? You could be the mastermind behind some epic projects without having to be the face that’s always out there. 

I'm curious—what strategies have you tried or are considering? Anyone ready to take the plunge and go faceless? Let's hear your stories!",1,1750763870.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1lj8an8,https://i.redd.it/xq7ng8xryu8f1.jpeg,A brief summary of my Netherlands coffee experience and a shot of the haul,"I recently returned from Amsterdam and used the trip as an opportunity to explore as many roasters as possible without paying US shipping costs! While all of these roasters were wonderful to try, Friedhats really stood out to me. Their FUKU Cafe felt like a coffee haven. With probably 2 dozen plus varietals available as pour over or espresso, all dialed in immaculately, I ended up there most mornings. Their baristas were also all clearly passionate about the coffee as well, giving great recommendations and discussing all things about the wide variety of beans and recipes. 

While the DAK showroom felt like a candy store with all the tempting options, I ended up preferring their roasts from Morning Owl Coffee, a delightful little shop sourcing beans from all over the region and brewing them wonderfully. While the beans are delicious at DAK, their in house pour over surprisingly used Decent espresso machines fitted with pour over adapted baskets, which led to less satisfying cups in my opinion. I was also pleasantly surprised by the Sprout coferment pictured when trying it at Morning Owl. A roaster less often recommended in this sub, they produced one of the cleanest, least funky “experimental” processes I’ve tried, with the tasting notes bursting through in an almost sickly sweet manner. 

In short I was blown away by the coffee in Amsterdam, with seemingly endless options of roasters producing quality coffee. Now to make room in my freezer for all these beans!",9,1750763507.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

1lj89xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1lj89xf/i_got_humiliated_and_i_cant_stop_crying/,I got humiliated and I can't stop crying,"So, I am 29F and started my current job 7 months ago, and since this is a desk job and I also needed to change my healthy habits I thought why not starting work outs every morning before I start to work, and beforehand I found a nearby CrossFit, 2 minute walk from work so I can work out and then start my day, and for 7 months now, I had been going every week day since.

When I first started the CrossFit there were a group of 7-8 women who were regular and they were already friends that lived next to each other they also were friends before hand, only me and one other women became part of their friend group along the way, I was the last one to join. Since we saw each other everyday, we always stopped at the coffee machine and the coach (M36) always joined us, also another member (M45) joined and we always had a good time post workouts, drank coffee and went on with our day. Our friend group also involved gathering outside the CrossFit sometimes (only us women), for coffee or tea, and even though they are all 40+ in age, I blended perfectly and had a really good time.

We all have a ""teasy"" relationship with each other, we make fun of each other (including our coach), we mock with no harm each other and I always look forward to go and workout because of this environment that I was being in, even if I found myself lazy some day, I always said ""Oh, I'll have fun I better go"". 

This routine started to change a little for me, and I started to become more distant after one incident occurred between me and one of the members.  
  
For context, I was becoming close with one member of the group, we'll call her Amy (40F). Amy had a history of eloping with her sister's husband, got a kid with him, after that she came back from abroad, broke up, and he got back with Amy's sister. Amy and I got along after sometime together because she was the only one in the group who was not interacting with me that much, someone there told me her history and instead of gossiping I just shut that person down and said ""Oh, I feel bad for her"", since I didn't know much about her situation and I did not want to go further with the discussion, I left it there and I thought ""she got too much going on"", didn't take it personal and gave her the space. I didn't push the same relationship she had with others to have with me also, not my place. But, after a while she warmed up to me and we became really close. To make a long story short I noticed some weird behavior about her when she met my fiancee, she made constant comments, I just let it slide because as I said we all had teasy relations. She crossed a boundary one night with some comments and I texted her personally, not talking to a single soul about this, directly her and addressed that my boundaries were crossed and I just need some space from her right now. She proceeded to forward the text message to the group (we had a whatsapp one) and made me look like ""the crazy jealous one"". No one has said anything to me, and no one has commented on why or how that happened, but that made me distance myself a lot. I still had a good relationship to all other members and after pausing a week from my workouts I took the courage and went back. This happened almost 2 months ago, and things were fine. I was more focused on my workouts and drank coffee with them from time to time, not every day like I used to.

However, today, after we finished our workouts, during stretching, our Coach rushed us to finish. He did this yesterday too because he had a private appointment with someone else right after us, and didn't allow us any break for the whole workout routine, people on the group started to complain why he isn't giving us even a 2 minute break. Today, he did the stretching part just to say it was done, but I wasn't mad about it, I don't care about the stretching part, sometimes I used to skip it. I made a joke and said ""Teacher said us we need 30sec for each stretching"" (teacher is someone in our group that it is a teacher and we all call her that, one day Coach left her in charge for stretch guiding us and we always joked around about that). 

Coach replied ""then go and exercise to her home"", I laughed since I thought he was joking back, given our earlier relationship, and then he proceeded to say ""more workout, and less talking"", I was surprised, I just looked at him and said ""are you serious?"" he said ""yes, in my place I can tell people when to shut up"". All the members also were shocked and asked him why is he behaving that way and to please calm down. I just got my things and got out, I cried on my way back and I can't stop crying till now. 

I texted him and said that I didn't want to make the matters worse so I kept shut, he can tell me if I am not welcome there anymore since it's his business, but he doesn't have the rights to say to me ""shut up"", and I will not allow that disrespect.

I of course will not go back, but I feel so judged now given the two incidents, and I feel so heartbroken and humiliated. I also need to find a new CrossFit or Gym which usually are long distance from my work, but I guess I'll make it work.",3,1750763440.0,Vent,5,1.0,False
1lj89oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatewaytapes/comments/1lj89oi/summary_of_the_first_year/,Summary of the first year,"I saw a lot of posts with names like ""1 year result"" but I want to summarize my First year of ""existing"" with gatewaytapes and experience gained in the process.

I am not gonna describe in details the plays from which I started, lets just say it was dark. Many people, including the manual itself, don't recommend to do the tapes in state of depression, and I can clearly tell why, but after being stuck in 4 years of derealization/depersonalization , endless chains of sleep paralysis, I was desperate, so I tried everything I could find. The thing that brought me there was a 40HZ meditation, but I could not even compare it to tapes.

At first I did everything wrong, tapes were too loud, my room was too bright and i exercised too frequently (2 times a day, sometimes more) but even then l felt it, ""**knowns instead of beliefs or hopes**"". On the first month i read all 3 Bob's books and was absorbed by them, i wanted to experience that ,and then,2 maunth in my first luced dream happened , i would say that ""it was so beautiful anon"" but instead i say the trues, it was so fucking interesting. But the fear of death, the wary thing that locked me in this derealized state prevented me from progressing further.

I want to mention that i am a very impulsive person. I jumped into all this without really reading the manual(it was too much to read, like wtf I never read this amount of **PAGES** in English(not my native language)) and, like some people here I staggled to enter Focus 10 state, even tho Focus 12 felt really intense. After hitting a wall I took a couple of steps back, read the manual, and after that, I decided to limit amount of content from discord as well as from this thread because I felt like it could start to contradict each other and confuse me. About that time , I started to journal my experience, it wasn't like "">!dear diary, today I was...and then...could you imagine that?...anyway see you tomorrow, with love anon!<"" I wrote things that I ""felt"". many times I started to write something, lie down and added something else, it could have continued for an hour, and felt like a small revelation.

There wasn't many material changes >!I was manifesting dick growth(of course)  !< but changes in my personality was drastic, mager one was my releshenships with death, I manage to accept it as a fact and part of earth existing but that concept was so deeply rooted in me that I became nigilistic even about unearth existing(like what the point if I am gonna end to exist at some point anyway) but that was mostly my anxaitiy and impatience. That was the first time when I felt the fear of losing myself, Bobs words about ""Higher self"" and things like that fucked me up good. But approximately at this time the funny thing happened, somewhere near ""Non-physical friends"" my phone be it self decreased the voluce >!5 fucking times...!<ok... than other thing happened, but most importented one was hint about my apnea, it came to me in a dream, a really intense one, and well like an enchanted I want to a doctor and he suggested to do a sleep steady(>!which wasn't an option for me because a was berelle made ends meet!<)  . So I decades to find a man in my city who can borrow me a CPAP for a test. >!And o boy It was worth it!< after that I saved some money and bought a CPAP. I am not gonna say how better I started to feel myself , those who have apnea know what I mean.

But I still didn't manage to make ABE, my physical body was too tight, so I began stretching a lot.

Then a lot of other things happened. I moved out, met new friends, but at some point my body started to act ***weird.*** From that moment I cant sleep close to cables, or active electrical devices, my relationships with coffee changed(not like that was with Bob tho) and people around me started to act more friendly(but I guess it because I started to actually sleep).

But life had no plans to give me a break(of course now I clearly feel that there is no such thing a ""divine"" force that interferes with my life, but I really love such a turn of phrase). After recent bombardment the apartment I was renting was badly damaged, I lost lots of stuff as well as my CPAP so my sleep is terrible again. Now I temporarily live with my friends. But I know now that **I am more..**.)

I feel like my existence is too much.,"Today, I asked a simple “why?” to him. It was out of pure curiosity. And he exploded. He started cursing at me, furious that I had dared to ask a question.

I’ve been walking on eggshells for so long. I’ve learned not to confront him, not to push back, not to even speak unless necessary, because I know what happens if I do. My hands are still shaking as I write this.

I’m a naturally curious person. Maybe it’s the way my brain is wired. maybe it’s my autism. Yes I sometimes ask a lot of questions. I actually do ask a lot of questions. That’s how I connect, how I learn, how I make sense of the world. But he tells me that every time I ask something, he feels the urge to strangle me.

It’s not like I’m interrogating him. If he orders tea instead of coffee one day, I might ask why. because I find those little choices interesting. I like sharing things like “I took a different route home because the trees looked beautiful,” or “I changed my order today because I saw a post about matcha and suddenly craved it.” These small things feel meaningful to me. They’re how I connect.

But he says no one else in the world asks this many questions. That when I speak, he feels accused. That my curiosity feels like an attack. So I’ve stopped talking. I’ve tried to shrink myself down.

I just want to feel safe being who I am. I want to feel safe asking a question. I want to be able to talk about normal things, tiny decisions, random thoughts. I wanna communicate these things without being made to feel like a burden.

Right now, he makes me feel like my existence itself is exhausting. That simply asking questions makes me unlovable. And I feel like I’m drowning.

The kids dad and I broke up when I was 8 weeks pregnant and hasn’t helped or paid child support since. 

This pregnancy has been extremely physically difficult and has been getting harder as the weeks go on. I haven’t slept a full night since the pregnancy began and the last week or so I’ve had excruciating pain from pregnancy and have found it hard to function at all physically.

The last month or so my toddler has become completely unbearable. He always has to be on top of me or within 2 feet of me AT ALL TIMES. I can’t go to the bathroom alone, shower alone, I can’t get two seconds to myself. Even when I make dinner he is stuck at my feet the whole time. 

He is incredibly intelligent for his age. He can understand and follow instructions but when I ask him to do something he straight up ignores me or says no, this is something that is only new as he used to do what he was told as much as you could expect from a toddler. I repeat myself at least 15 times before I start to get frustrated. I tell him no and he stands and continues doing what he’s told not to. 

As if all of this wasn’t enough, the last week or so he has just plain out refused to go into his cot as if he is afraid of something. The screams he does when I put him in it are unbelievable. Nothing happened him, nothing changed. I’ve tried staying in the room with him, getting into the cot with him or even trying to get him to fall asleep in my bed so I can lift him in but no. The last few nights he’s been awake until after midnight and then if I put him in the cot he wakes in the night screaming. I can’t sleep with him in my bed because of how much pain I am in and how uncomfortable I am and I don’t want to twist and turn when he is in the bed incase I waken him.

I feel like I’m living a nightmare. I don’t have any support or help. I’m drowning in parenthood and I have so many issues of my own I want to try and work out but I don’t have the time to myself to think. I just want to be left alone for a little while I just want silence for a little while he never shuts up he never sleeps he never does what he’s told I’m exhausted. The fact I’m going to have a newborn in the mix in a few weeks makes me want to crawl into a black hole because how on earth am I going to cope.

Today is the first day in two weeks I got to wash my hair and he stood at the side of the shower the whole time whinging, throwing things in on me or or trying to get into the shower. I just want to take a nap I just want a cup of coffee in peace I just want to sit and watch a tv show without answering the same stupid question a million times. I’m so frustrated and I really just needed to vent.",6,1750763131.0,toddlers,1,1.0,False

1lj84nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Episcopalian/comments/1lj84nn/what_version_of_the_bible_does_the_episcopal/,What version of the Bible does the Episcopal Church use? + update on my church visit(s),"A while back, I posted here saying that I was exploring churches in my area to see which church fit me the most and I wanted to try the Episcopal Church! I'm the anxious former Orthodox redditor.

Thank you everyone for your responses then! I enjoyed that Sunday (Trinity Sunday) and the service this past Sunday! The church near me is in the process of trying to find a vicar, so I felt I also had to go this past Sunday too, since the Bishop was coming and my understanding is that the Bishop sets the tone for the diocese. Anyways, I really enjoyed it! Oh and I was surprised that during the coffee hour this past Sunday, during the Bishop visit, the Bishop took questions from the congregation, and it felt like she genuinely wanted to talk to people. Is that normal?

I did mess up here and there during both services, but the people were awesome! And I was shocked to see at least 100 people there both times, with a good chunk being under 40 (no shade to older people- they are amazing, and they were probably the most welcoming, but I didn't expect to see so many people around my age). And the coffee hour was surprisingly well attended during both my visits! Like about half of the congregation stayed during my first Sunday, and for the Bishop visit, most people stayed after! The parking lot was nearly full both times!! And this is considered a mission/small church!! I was quite shocked, but again, everyone was very welcoming!


Anyways, to my main question: what Bible version do you all use? On my first visit, one of the ladies currently organizing the church gave me a little booklet called Forward Day by Day with Bible readings for each day. I asked her which Bible version to use for it, and she didn't know because she was a cradle Episcopelian (which is, from what I gathered, rare for this congregation since most people end up here after experiencing some sort of religious trauma from other denominations) and she just uses her family's old Bible. Google says it's the NRSV but is it the NRSVUE, the plain NRSV, or the NRSV-CI?  Idk if the verses align with every version of the NRSV... I really want to give the little booklet a try!

1lj84kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lj84kw/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_i_spent_22_from/,AITA for not telling my husband I spent $22 from my own money?,"Hi! 
I (F27) am married to my husband (M30), and we have two kids. I’m currently on maternity leave but still receiving my regular income. Before this, I worked and will return to work once my leave ends. Throughout our marriage, I’ve always been the one better with finances budgeting, saving, thinking ahead. My husband, not so much. He smokes (spends $100 a month on cigarettes), often grabs coffee with coworkers, and makes random purchases at the store without asking or informing me , and I never demand he does.

The issue: a few days ago I ordered something online for myself that cost $22), using my own account, my own money. I didn’t think it was a big deal , I never really spend money on myself and hadn’t in months. It felt like a harmless little thing. I didn't think much of it.

Later, when my husband asked how much was left on the account, I told him the amount, and he was suprised and asked ""wasn't it more?"". Thein I mentioned that I ordered something for $22 and also there was the account maintenance fee. His tone changed immediately. He asked why I didn’t tell him earlier. I asked why what's the problem? And he was like ""well I wanted to order something from that website for a dollar or two for the car"". And then I said he never mentioned it and I just didn't think about asking him if he wanted something, to me ot wasn't a big deal. He asked again why didn't I tell him. Then I was confused and said, “I didn’t think I had to , it’s not a large amount and I haven’t bought anything for myself in forever.” He replied, “Why are you hiding things from me?” That hit me hard.

I told him that was a really hurtful thing to say. I wasn’t hiding anything ,he would’ve seen the package arrive anyway and I can't hide the stuff once it arrives. But he doubled down and said, “Well, what else is it if not hiding?” Then it turned into a whole argument. I reminded him that he once booked a 90$ outing without consulting me and didn’t even tell me the full cost until I asked several times. But now I’m being accused of hiding something over $22 ??

When I told him how it made me feel ,that it seems like I have to justify every tiny purchase while he never does ,he told me, “You’re just making things up. Say something often enough and you start believing it.” That honestly broke me.

To make a point, I said I’d set a $30 month “budget” for myself going forward ,not because I think I shouls need one, but JUST to avoid this ridiculous dynamic. But I’m angry that I even had to say that. It’s humiliating that I feel monitored over minor spending from my own account, when he regularly spends waayy more on non-essentials.

He insists it’s not about the money, but about the “principle” of being informed. Yet the way he reacted felt like control and lack of trust. I’ve never lied or hidden anything from him, and it’s exhausting trying to defend myself over something so small when he doesn’t hold himself to the same standard.

AITA for not telling him in advance that I spent $22?

I’m open to all opinions. I want to hear what others think, even if it’s not what I want to hear. Just trying to get perspective here.

Yeah, same. Over time I’ve picked up some simple, no-nonsense ways to cut expenses and stretch what I earn without turning my life into a sacrifice ritual. Here's a practical list that actually works if you're serious about spending less.

# Ways to Bring in Extra Money

* Sell stuff you don’t use. eBay, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, whatever works where you live.
* Offer simple services: tutoring, lawn work, pet sitting, computer repair, baking, sewing, etc.
* Collect scrap metal, bottles, or cans if your area allows recycling for cash.
* Make food or baked goods for local events, farmers markets, or neighborhood orders.

# Household Cuts That Make Sense

* Ditch the dryer. Line-dry your clothes indoors or outdoors. Saves power and money.
* Plan meals ahead. Use leftovers. Keep it boring if you must... rice and beans work.
* Freeze extra portions. It cuts down cooking time later and saves gas/electricity.
* Cut detergent and soap amounts. Use 1/3 less. No one notices, but the bottle lasts longer.
* Track every single expense for a month. Painful but necessary to find leaks.
* Use a cash envelope system. It’s harder to overspend with real cash.

# Food Strategies That Don’t Feel Like Starvation

* Learn basic cooking. YouTube will teach you everything for free.
* Bake your own snacks or bread. Cheap, easy, and a decent side hustle if you’re good at it.
* Buy bulk when prices are low freeze or store smartly.
* Generic > brand. You’re mostly just paying for the logo.
* Make popcorn at home. Healthier, cheaper, more fun than microwave packs or chips.
* Never shop hungry. That’s how $20 of junk ends up in your cart.

# Lifestyle Changes That Add Up

* Start with one bill or category. Cut that down, then move on to the next.
* Bundle errands. You’ll save fuel and time.
* Avoid “just browsing” at stores. That’s where budgets go to die.
* If possible, shop without your kids or spouse. Saves money. Trust me.
* Make a game out of finding the cheapest way to get something. It’s oddly satisfying.

# You Don’t Have to Deprive Yourself

* Thrift stores, garage sales, Freecycle, Buy Nothing groups lots of good stuff if you’re patient.
* Kids don’t need the latest of everything. Hand-me-downs work just fine.
* You can still go out just do it less. One dinner out won’t kill your budget. Five will.",1,1750762508.0,CheapButGood,0,1.0,False

I use caffeine to make me feel normal and 'happy', but I'm not.

I use caffeine to get through any social event or situation because I feel I need to be alert for it.

I'm scared of stopping because I don't want to feel all those painful emotions that are deep under the surface.

# I’m on all fours with George thrusting into my pussy from under me and Gio in my ass, George was sucking on my boobs, fuck this feels like heaven. There are hands everywhere. Antonio and Dante are standing on both sides of me. They are making turns pushing their dicks into my mouth. There is not a hole that is not filled at this stage. Antonio is rough in fucking my mouth, he goes right to the back of my mouth until I gag before he pulls out and Dante takes over. Dante is gentler and likes it when I play with my tongue around his dick. Antonio just wants to fuck my mouth no funny business. When Dante goes deep and make me gag it’s Antonio’s turn again. I could feel my orgasm approaching and it feels like the best orgasm ever I’m not so sure if it’s a good idea to have Antonio or Dante’s dick in my mouth when I cum. I might just bite it off. I started groaning around Antonio’s dick and he moaned, Dante was whispering in my ear what a good girl I am, but somewhere in the distance I hear Miley Cyrus singing about a wrecking ball. Are we not alone anymore? Is there someone in the house? I was coming closer and closer to my release Dante’s whispering in my ear what’s to push me over, the grunting from George and Gio is making it worse but Miley is getting louder and louder. I want to open my eyes to look at George to see his face when he cumes but as I open my eyes all I see is white ceiling and hearing Miley singing ‘I came in like a wrecking ball’ I was a bit disoriented when I realized Miley was singing on the radio which was my alarm clock and it was just a dream. ‘Oh my God how can I have a dream like that about my biggest clients am I crazy? But jeez it was a good dream. I was still horney as hell, I reached out to the draw where BOB was lying but then I saw the time.’ Shit I’m going to be late there is no time for my Battery-operated boyfriend today, BOB. Shit and my first meeting were with the guys I just dreamed of how on earth am I going to not think about my dream while I’m busy with them. I will have to put my armor on today, which was one of my pant suits. No way to get near my pussy with that on. I quickly took a shower put my long brown hair into stiff bun and did my make up I had this thing I did with my make up that brings out my green eyes even more it distracts most of the men from my sizeable D-Cup boobs. I’m in a more dominant men’s world being a broker but not a normal broker a broker for the criminals of Miami, Mafia, Cartel and anyone that can effort my services. I learned everything I know from my dad. He unfortunately passed away a few years ago and it was only us, my mom passed away when I was still in school. The only problem with my father was he only worked for one Mafia family. Why do you only want to be with one family when there is so many that can use your help and so much money to be made. I put some of my favorite perfume on Alien from Thierry Mugler and I was ready for the day. I walked to the door and looked back into my apartment making sure everything was neat and on its place. I live in an apartment building in Key Biscayne, when you look out my window all you see is the ocean and when you look down you see different shapes of swimming pools. I love my apartment, it’s big and everything in the apartment is white from my bedding to my couches and dinning room chairs. My kitchen is all white with marble. My apartment was my sanctuary my happy place and I was definitely not thinking of having children one day so white suited me. The Rossi surname will die with me because I was the only child.

# I got in the lift and went down to the garage and got in my white Porch Cayenne which I bought with my first paycheck, cash it was the best feeling to buy myself such a big present cash. The guys weren’t that impress with me when they saw what I was driving apparently, it’s not the safest car for what I do. What that meant I don’t know but I love my car and they have no say over me so I didn’t care what they thought I help them with their business and that’s it. I drove to George and Gio’s house, which was my favorite from the guy’s houses. They we’re all living next to each other it was only George and Gio that lived together probable because they were twins. They all lived next to the water there was a small walk way and you where on the dock where their boat was. They don’t stay together but they decided to buy a boat together. Because it was a waste of money to have 3 according to them. Hey each to his own.

I’m not sure about the dynamic of the guys I’ve heard rumors but I’m not the type to judge. And after this morning’s dream, I most certainly can not judge. But maybe it’s because of what I heard about them that I had that dream. Apparently, they always share women, where they get the women to share, I don’t know. But to be honest it can’t be that difficult for them. George and Gio are tall and you have to look twice to set the 2 apart. Both have black hair, olive skin and hazel brown eyes with the neatest beards and they were built like Greek God’s. Antonia and Dante where also build like Greek God’s although they were all Italian. Antonia had dark brown hair, green eyes like mine and he always have a 5 o’clock shadow. Dante on the other hand had dark long hair I just want to push my fingers through his hair every time I see him and blue eyes. I was getting wet just thinking about them but I had a rule never mix business and pleasure especially not in my line of work. Fantasying about them should have to be enough for me. And that is where BOB comes in, I fantasize about them and BOB does the work.

**Chapter 2**

I got in my white Porche Cayenne put the radio on as load as my ears would allow it and drove out onto the hectic Miami traffic. Miley Cyrus was singing about buying herself flowers, that’s something I always do, because who else will bring me flowers. I’m way to busy for a relationship and have to many male clients I’m very sure no man would like that. My first meeting is with the guys I dreamed about they call their company D.A.G.G. it’s the first letter of each of their names, Dante, Antonio, George and Gio. They’ve been friends for years, since high school and went to Uni together. Then they decided to go into business together. Let’s just say their fathers wasn’t very happy I mean it’s 3 of the biggest names in the Italian Mafia, The Armani’s, The Morelli’s and The Ferrari’s. But for some reason they are very successful together. They have various businesses, from apartment buildings, night clubs, strip clubs and business blocks, this obviously makes my work much easier there is different businesses to launder the money through. My only problem with these guys except my dream and the fact that they are hot as fuck is the fact that they expect me to leave everything when they call me. They treat me like they treat the dancer if they say jump, I should ask how high. But that’s were they get very irritated with me because I don’t just sometimes, I play hard to get. One or two of them has made a pass at me but I ignore it. We’re doing business together and that is it. I approached George and Gio’s gates and the security guard, opens the gates for me. They know me by know. “Morning Miss Rossi.” He said as I drive by, I just waved at him. I stopped in front of the house, everyone was already there, their cars where also standing in front of the house. The all have body guards that drive them around in Escalade’s, why I don’t know they all have their own sports car, but apparently when they go out for business their bodyguards drive them in the Escalades. One of the men that is always outside the house, comes and open my car door for me. “Thank you.” I don’t remember the staff names, yes that’s not very nice of me but I have a lot of clients and it’s difficult enough remembering their names. He walks in front of me and open the front door for me. I hear Gio screaming, “Emilia we’re in the kitchen.” Great this means we are having breakfast, as I was too late to eat breakfast this morning because of my dream, I’m very happy with this. I walk through the house and found Gio, George, Antonio and Dante in the kitchen. Gio came walking over to me giving me air kisses, then Dante. George and Antonio have never done it before, so it also needless to tell you witch 2 men has made a move on me before, yes Gio and Dante. They are the playful type. George and Antonio where the more serious and brooding type. Dante gave me a hug, he must have lingered to long because I heard Antonio clear his throat, “That’s enough Dante.” “Jeez keep your pants on Antonio.” That was the other thing with these guys their banter, you never now if one of them are serious. “Come sit Amelia.” George said. He pulled the chair out for me. “Thank you, George.” Then Antonio and Gio took out all the pastries and the coffee. “You know you guys don’t need to do this every time we have an early meeting right?” “Yes, we know but did you eat this morning?” Antonio half barked. I blushed then just said “No I didn’t have time.” “Then it’s good we made food.” Dante joked “Yes right you made all these pastries.” “Emilia, Emilia you don’t know half of our talents.” Gio said with a sexy smile on his face. I looked away and berated myself, ‘Get your head back in the game Emilia stop thinking about your dream.’ “Why you blushing?” George asked. “I’m not. What can I do for you guys today?” “First we eat then we talk business.” Dante said. “You guys do know I have more meetings today it not just you guys.” “But it could be.” Antonio barked again. “I told you before Antonio you guys can’t afford me.” “What do you know what we can effort. You only work with the illegal side of our business.” George said. “Fine I don’t want to lose my other clients, okay.” “Fine we will sit eat and talk business.” Antonio said again. “What do you need from me.” “A lot.” I heard Dante whisper. But I just ignored it. It was like I didn’t hear him. “We need firearms.” Antonio said. “Normal shipment or more?” I asked them “Triple than the last time and we need it by next week Tuesday.” George said. “Will you be able to get it for us?” Dante asked me. “Guys this is Amelia Rossi, off course she will be able to get it for us. Am I right Amelia?” Gio asked. “Yes Gio, it’s the time frame is tight but I’m sure I’ll get it done. I’ll have an answer for you by Wednesday.” “Good then we also have money that came in the weekend that needs to disappear.” Antonio said. That’s no problem. I have another meeting, when I come back, I will pick up the cash. If that suits you guys.” “Yes, I’ll be at home the whole day.” George said. “Good. Then I should go.” “No! Finish your breakfast.” Antonio barked again. ‘Who pissed him of this morning’ I thought. I went back to my croissant and espresso. “So, what did you do this weekend Rossi.” Gio asked. “I worked and went shopping, that’s it.” “Jeez Rossi you need to get a social life or a boyfriend.” Dante said but I caught the murderous look Antonio gave him. “Maybe not a boyfriend I have all these men clients I can’t think a man would be happy with that.” “If he is a grown man and not the jealous type I can’t see why not.” Gio said. Then it was George giving him the evil eye. ‘What the fuck is going on with these men today.’ “Let’s stick to you guys being my clients and not getting involved in my love life.” “Or lack there off.” Gio chipped in again. This time I thought George will throw him with something.

**Chapter 3**

I ignored the looks the men gave each other and finished my breakfast. I knew they wouldn’t let me leave if I didn’t finish it and I had another meeting to get to, at least it wasn’t to far from George and Gio’s house. The men were still bantering about something, I forgot to listen to them because they do that a lot and then they will ask me something and I would have no clue what just happened. Like right now. “What do you think Emilia?” Antonio asked. “Sorry what?” “Guys she zoned out on us again.” Gio teased. “I would love to see into that head of yours.” George said. That took me a bit off guard because he doesn’t normally tease me. “What where you saying?” I asked again. “Dante was asking about the diamonds we ordered.” Antonio said a bit irritated that the question should be asked again. “What about the diamonds?” “I wanted to know if we are still getting them this Friday you did have a problem with your supplier the previous time.” Dante said again. “I told you guys that was sorted out and yes your diamonds will be here.” “Thank you, Rossi.” Dante said. “Sorry guys I have to leave know I’ll come back in say 4 hours to fetch the money.”  Your next meeting is going to take 4 hours?” Antonio said a bit shocked. “Yes, Antonio it is. Thanks for breakfast, George see you later.” Then they all walked me to the front door. George’s bodyguard walked over to me and walked me to my car, what on earth could happen to me from the front door to my car, but this happens every time and I said something about it once and not one of them where happy with me not even the 2 easy going one’s. So, I just let him walk me to my car and open my door for me. I made a turn and drive out of George and Gio’s property. I always feels a bit off balance or uneasy when I leave them it’s like a part of me wants me to stay but a bigger part of me know I would never be able to chose between them and it would never work. So, dreaming about them is my best option.

I reached my next destination, The Columba Crime Family the head of the family is Alejandra and the 2 underneath him is Diego and Miguel. They are the men I always deal with. When I get to the gate it’s not like with the men I was with earlier. Oh no they check the whole cars for bombs or firearms and they search me when I get to the house before they let me get anywhere near Alejandra. When I went through all the security measures I eventually get to Alejandra, Diego and Migual they were sitting at the dining room with all the money they received from the drug dealers over the weekend. When I come here, I need to put all the bills together and then use my bill counter to count the money then there is always an argument about the cut I take not normally from Alejandra but Diego and Miguel can be dicks sometimes. When I looked at them today, I could see it’s going to be one of those days. “Good day gentleman.” “Emilia, on time as always.” “You know me, Alejandra.” “Now let’s get busy shall we.” I walked over to the table and started doing what I do best sorting out money and then making them disappear. I must say today there was quite a lot of money. When I sorted it, I put them through the bill counter, every time it went through one of them needs to sign next to the amount I put down in my book, I’m old school I need to make sure the machine and my calculation is the same if it is not, I start the process over needless to say my clients isn’t very happy with that. But so far so good. Everything was counted, “Okay gentleman here is a total of $6 million you know my cut is 5% that means my share is $300K. That’s this money here, Diego if you want to count it.” “I think I will.” He spoke. See I know my clients, I know their moods and their facial expression, I know when they are going to be difficult it’s just the 4, I just left that I can’t figure out.

When them it’s a surprise every time. Diego finished counting the money then I put my money in my big handbag and put they’re in suitcases, I need to go and deposit this money in different accounts. I never do it at once that will trigger the Feds, but at least I know what I’m doing and that is why I’m getting paid the big bucks. I greeted Alejandra, Diego and Migual and walked with 2 briefcases and Alejandra’s bodyguards with more money. I had a customized safe put in my car in the back and under the back seat, if someone ever hijacks me, I’ll be in a lot of trouble. Let’s hope that never happens. I locked all the cases in the safe and got back in my car. When I looked at the watch in the car, I saw I was right 4 hours exactly at the Columba Crime Family. I drove back to George and Gio’s place and like always the security guard waved me in. I stopped in front of the house and George’s bodyguard came to fetch me again. Gio opened the door for me I thought it would be George. “Hi Rossi. Exactly 4 hours you know your stuff.” “I told you.” I smiled at him. “That smile is going to get you in trouble.” Gio said but I wasn’t sure. “What did you say?” “Nothing don’t worry about it come, the suitcases are in my office.” I walked behind Gio to his office. The suitcases were ready for me to take. Gio closed the door behind him, which was a bit strange I walked to the suitcases to take them when Gio but his hand on my hand I looked up at him I don’t know what my face said but he bends forward and kissed me, he kissed me like he wanted to make love to my mouth, I groaned and he took the advantage of forcing his tongue in my mouth, fuck what happened to my rule. I didn’t kick him I kissed him back in fact I loved being kissed by him, then my brain must have started working again because I moved back and solid into the wall when I turned around it wasn’t the wall but a solid George trapping me between him and Gio.

**Chapter 4**

G.G…George” I stuttered “How did you get in here?” He showed me the open book shelve that is used as a door between his and Gio’s office. “Excuse me please I need to go.” “Oh no you don’t.” George said “I really do.” “Oh, come on Rossi you know you liked that kiss.” Gio teased me. “I didn’t say I didn’t like it but it’s against my rules.” “Rules are meant to be broken Rossi.” Gio teased again. But not Gio or George was moving out of my way. “Guys I really need to go.” “Okay I’ll let you go if you give me the same kiss you gave my brother.” George said while turning me to face him. “Are you serious?” I asked George. “Why would you think I’m not?” “It’s just, I just kissed your brother?” “I know that and know I want you to kiss me like that.” I looked at Gio kind of asking permission but also not, I mean I am my own person.

But Gio said “Go ahead Rossi, I would like to watch.” Those words made George react immediately, he took his hands and grab each ass cheek and picked me up in order for us to be the same height, then he kissed me and pressed my body against his, I couldn’t help it I threw my legs around his waist, I started to feel like a slut. He was trying to force my mouth open but I tried to keep it close then he gave by top lip a bit of a bite and that made me groan out load, oh God how embarrassing, but he took his chance and plunged his tongue into my mouth. George didn’t kiss me like he wanted to make love to me he kissed me like he wanted to dominant me and fuck was that sexy.

I tried to pull away but he didn’t let me. Then I felt Gio standing right behind me moving his hands up and down my sides and every time he comes to my breast his hands would move to the front touching my breast at the bottom. I could feel myself getting wet and I knew I needed to stop this or it won’t stop until we are all naked. I pushed away and this time George let me then Gio retreat from the back of me and George let my slide down his body. My jacket was all pulled up and you could almost see my breast peeking out. “Sorry guys that shouldn’t have happened.” “No need to be sorry Rossi we wanted it to happen.” “I can’t we doing business together.” “Yes, we know.” George said but then he bends down and whispered in my ears “But tell me Emilia are you wet?” I was in shocked but also blushed.

And then George disappeared and it was only me and Gio again. “Let me help you carry the suitcases to your car Rossi,” Gio said like nothing just happened. I opened the safe under my back seat and put the suitcases in the safe then Gio disappeared and I was alone with the bodyguard. ‘Fuck what just happened?’ I thought as I got in the car. I put my hand on my heart and the thing was beating a million miles an hour. That should be evidence that it did happen. I drove to my office not really taken notice of where I was driving, I’m sure my car new how to get to my office from George’s house by know. All I could think about was the kiss with Gio and George for twins they kiss so different. And I liked both kisses. Fuck what am I going to do how am I going to keep my hormones at bay. I drove into the underground parking at my office building and the security guard that always helps me came to my car. “Good afternoon Ms. Emilia, how are you today?” “Good Thank you Luke.” “Can I help you Ms.?” “Yes please, I’ll get the suitcases out.” I let Luke carry the suitcases from the guys and I took the Columba Crime Family cases.

“Luke just put it in my office” I said as I walked into the reception area where Isabella was sitting. “Hi Emilia, you have a visitor in your office.” “Who is it?” “Antonio Morelli” “Fuck” I whispered what is it with these men today? “Thank you, Isabella.” I walked into my office and Luke was looking at Antonio from top to bottom like he was a threat. “Thank you, Luke.” “You good here Ms.?” “Yes, Luke Mr. Morelli is a client.” “Okay then.” Luke left us. “Who is that man?” Antonio asked. “Just the security guard that helps me sometimes.” “You should be more careful who you allow near you Emilia.” “Will that be people like you Antonio?” “No definitely not me but do tell me how was your visit with the twins?” Fuck did he know, why would he know, why would he ask me something like that. “Fine Why?” “Only fine? They guys should up their game.” “What do you mean Antonio?” He walked towards me and every time he gives a step forward, I give one back. My back was against the wall and Antonio was in front of me. “Th..the.. they told you?” I stuttered again. What the fuck is going on with me I never stutter but with these men it’s all I do. “Don’t you know this yet Emilia we have no secrets between us.” “Like in none?” I asked a bit confused. “Yes, Emilia none, nessuno, nothing.” Then he pressed his body against mine. “What can I help you with Antonio?” I said. “You didn’t answer George when he asked you something. I’m here to get my share and the answer.”

Before I could say anything, he took my lips in a kiss that was sinful he pressed his knee between my legs and press up against my pussy. That made me groan out load and he took the opportunity to push his tongue in my mouth and took over the kiss, he was the same as George he wanted to dominate me his kiss was delicious. These men were making me lose my mind today. With last nights dream and then today with their kisses, fuck it was becoming more and more difficult to say no to these men. But again, my brain must have started to work because I pulled away and he let me. Then he came to my ear and said “We will have you, Emilia.” Before my brain worked again and I could ask him what did he mean he was gone and again I was left with the feeling. Did this really happen.

**Chapter 5**

I was standing in the middle of my office totally flabbergasted, what the fuck is going on today with these men and every time they leave it’s as if nothing happened. The only person I didn’t have an encounter today was Dante that’s without the encounter of this morning at breakfast. Hopefully I’m not seeing any of them for today further. I didn’t know what to make of it. Could they see into my head is that why they reacting this way today. Do they know about my dream. “Don’t be silly Emilia off course they don’t know.” I said out loud. “Get back to work.” I told myself again. Jeez I was going crazy that is definitely happening today. I start with the Columba Crime Families money. I need to buy a million rands bitcoin and get rid of the rest through the strip club, the corner stores and the dry cleaner. That I always found funny laundering money through a dry cleaner. I packed the one briefcase full of money and gave it to Isabella to go and give it to the corner stores and the dry cleaner. I probable should think of bodyguards but if you, women alone walk with a handbag or briefcase no one will suspect a thing but if I walk with a bodyguard there will be suspicion. Isabella left and I went to lock the front door. I got the other money ready to go to the strip club tonight. That wonderful task is left to me. I couldn’t ask Isabella to do it, it’s already and issue for me to go into those places, don’t get me wrong I don’t look down on any women that dance for a living. You have to do what you have to do but the sleazy men are what gets me. And the fact that I always do it after hours will also be an issue. I need to count out 2 million and put that back in the safe for the rest of the weeks, dry cleaner and corner store drops.

And the other 2 million I need to take to the bank. I’m very good friends with the bank manager and he always helps me for a fee off course but I’ll pay his fee anytime. I put that one side; I’ll do that when Isabella is back. Then I start with the men’s money. It’s already packed neatly and there is a short note on top of one of the suitcases. ‘Keep this case for the firearms.’ I open the other case. ‘This is for the diamonds.’ And the other 2 cases didn’t have any notes with that meant I need to get rid of it. I checked the money and it was 2 million on the dot. 1 million I can bank and the other million I will distribute between their businesses. I went to my safe where I had a special place for every person I deal with I also prefer different color briefcases for every client. Yes, it cost me a few dollars to do it that way but it’s not like I can’t afford it. As soon as I sorted the safe, I went back to my desk that’s when I heard someone at the door, I got up with a pit or was it butterflies in my stomach, could it be Dante? As I approached the door, I saw it was only Isabella bringing us some ice coffee after her deliveries. I’m not sure how I felt maybe a bit disappointed that it wasn’t Dante. “Here you go Emilia.” “Thank you, Isabella, just what I needed.” I told her. “Everything went well?” “Yes, off course you know nobody gives me problems ever. I might be petit and blond but no one messes with me.” “I’m very glad to hear that. I’m just going to enjoy this coffee before I go to the bank quickly.” “No problem.” I went back to my office and just sat and drank my ice coffee. Ice coffee is the best drink in this Miami heat. I was starting to day dream about how Dante would kiss. The others where, oh my God I don’t have words to explain how hot that was. As a slurped the last bit of coffee out of my cup it took me out of my day dream. “Emilia business and pleasure doesn’t work stop it and besides do you really want 4 men to tell you what to do?” That was something to think about, I did have a very health libido. “Fuck Emilia stopped it.” I was really going mad. I took the money in my oversize handbag and walked to the bank, luckily for me my friend was working at the bank right across the street from us. He was sexy in his own way a real surfer type of guy with blond sun kissed hair and very darkly tanned, which is probable normal for Miami residents. Only problem I was seeing coming was he got a thing for me and I was playing along to get the money in the bank but I didn’t like him in that way and every time he sees me, he asks me out and every time I made an excuse soon, I’ll have to say yes. I walked into the bank and he must have seen me enter because he immediately walked to me, “Hi beautiful” he gave me air kisses. “Hi Josh, how are you?” “Good thank you come into my office the aircon is much cooler in there.” He always said that I guess it’s a way to get me alone to do our business but also to get me alone because he always flirts with me for a while before we actually get down to business but I’m a bit late today and the bank is closing in 30 minutes. So, we have to get down to business. “Josh, I have 2 million today 2 separate bank accounts please.” “All good Emilia I have the bill counter right here.” “Great, I’m sorry I’m so late today but the day got away from me.” “It’s okay just tell me you will go out for coffee with me tomorrow and you are forgiven.” Shit I didn’t think this tactic through. “I can probably make it tomorrow lunch time?” I told him. “Excellent. Then let’s get this done. He counted the money or should I say the machine counted the money and then he deposited into the account I gave him and he did the same with the other million. “Thank you, Josh, see you tomorrow.” “See tomorrow at 12 Emilia the coffee shop next to the bank.” “Okay bye.” I said as I walked out. I quickly walked back to my office to get the other money I needed to take to the strip clubs. I didn’t like to go so late so I go just after 5 pm and you would be surprise to see how many men already sits there watching the strippers. “Hi Isabella you can go, I’m just getting the other money I have to deliver at the strip clubs then I’m done for the day.” “Okay Emilia, enjoy your evening.” “You to Isabella.” I got the 2 suitcases and walked to my Porch Cayenne, I put it in the safe in my back seat and drove off, I drove first to Vanilla Unicorn that belonged to the Columba Crime Family, with them it was an easy in and out, the manager knows me by now and I walk directly to his office every time. He offered me a drink as always but I declined.

Then I got back in my car and drove to the guys first strip club it was called Glitter Gloss where they came up with these names, I had no idea. The parking area was clear no black SUV’s that meant they are not here. Again, I felt a bit sad that I’m not going to see them again today or should I say Dante. I took one of the cases and walked to the managers office. One of the waiters needed to fetch him for me first because there was an issue with one of the girls and a man. Eventually he got to his office and took the cash from me. It was already past 7 pm and now I was just getting irritated I was tired and hungry or should I say hangry. I was glad the guys made me eat breakfast this morning. I stopped at my last drop for the day the guy’s other club called Bahama Mama’s yet again no black SUV’s but there was a sportscar in the parking area that looked a bit out of place like my own does. I walked into the club and the manager got me at the bar. He took the briefcase and told me he will be right back. That was quick thank God, I turned around to walk out of the club but I walked straight into Dante. Fuck was this a good or bad thing. “Dante!”

**Chapter 6**

Dante sorry I didn’t see you there.” “It would appear so, you wanne have a drink with me?” “I’m really hungry and tired Dante I’d rather go home, maybe another time.” “When last did you eat?” I blushed a little but was sure he won’t be able to see as it was so dark in the strip club. “This morning with you guys.” “Emilia you can’t do that, come with me.” He grabbed my arm and basically dragged me. “Where you taking me?” “To my office and then I’m going to feed you.” Oh my God I think my panties just exploded. All this sexual build up the whole day was not good for me. We got in the lift and Dante was still holding my arm. I was day dreaming in my head how he pushes me back against the elevator door and I wrapped my legs around his waist and Dante sinking into my wet pussy with his hard cock. I must have zoned out because Dante was waving his hand in front of my face. “Earth to Rossi.” “Sorry I’m just tired.” I tried to hide what I was actually thinking. “Yes sure, not with that smile on your face.” I took a look around and it was the most beautiful office I’ve ever seen especially for a strip club. You can look right onto the stage from here and then they have booths to sit and have a drink at or eat at. It was totally out of place for a strip club. “Very nice office.” “Not what you where expecting.” “Not at all.” “Well, this is our office the office downstairs is the managers.

In this office we do business or if we want to blow of steam we come here. Take a seat.” He helped me to the booth that look right down on the ladies that where stripping. I watch 2 stripped before Dante asked me “Can I get you a steak and chips?” “Steak and Salad please I need to keep this body one way or another and going to gym is not in the cards for me.” “I’ll be right back.” I heard him make a call and he ordered 2 steaks and salads medium rare, oh wow he knows how I like my steak or is it just everyone’s preference. Then he was back moving into the booth next to me but very close to me. “And why can’t you get to a gym?” “Well, I start early morning working and you see what time it is and I’m not even home yet.” “You need to set boundaries with your clients.” Oh, right you one to talk. “I try but some are very convincing and then I end up eating dinner with them or breakfast.”

“I like it when you put it in that order.” “Dante, you know what I mean.” “Do I really?” “I’m sure you do. This morning’s breakfast and now Dinner with you.” “Don’t be so touchy Rossi I did know what you mean I was just pulling your leg. Do you always work this late?” “Most Monday’s and Tuesdays from Wednesday I can normally be at home by 6 pm. But then it’s me a good book and a glass of wine to relax from the 2 hectic days.” “And boyfriends?” “We spoke about it this morning I don’t have boyfriends I don’t have time and I have very demanding clients. I’m not sure men would understand that.” “Certain men would.” There was a knock on the door then I smelled the steak and I was salivating. “You want something to drink with the steak Rossi.” “Gin and tonic if you have.” I normally don’t drink with clients but so many rules have been broken today why not another one. I just know BOB will be very busy tonight. “One gin and tonic coming up.” The waiter put the food down in front of us with the salad dressing on the side. Oh, wow he even thought about that. He came back and sit next to me with just enough space for us to eat but he kept on bumping me with his knee. As I took my first bite of the steak a moaned and Dante looked at me. “What? it’s delicious.” “That groan is made for other things.” Before I released what I said I asked “Like what?” And then I realized what I said. “Sorry I didn’t mean to say that.” “I’m more than willing to show you what to use that groan for Rossi.” “Business Dante you are one of my clients.” “Is that what you told the others today.” “Do you guys really discuss everything with each other?” “Just important stuff.” “I’m most definitely not important.” “That’s what you think Rossi.” I decided not to go further into that statement. I finished my steak and salad Dante was quiet he didn’t say anything else. “Thank you, Dante it was very delicious.” “You glad you stayed.” “To my surprise yes I am glad.” “You know what Rossi?” “What Dante?” “You see those girls down there?” “Yes.” “One day very soon you are going to dance for me and the guys like that. I was shocked I didn’t know what to say to that. I just stared at him. Then he moved forward and grabbed my hips and pulled me towards him. I give a small yelp then Dante’s tongue was in my mouth and he kissed me he went in and kissed me I was in shock I don’t even think my lips moved and then he bit my lip and oh my God that feeling in my pussy was back and I was kissing him back. I don’t know if it was the gin and tonic or just the whole day’s foreplay but I got up without taking my lips of his and sat on his lap with a leg next to each of his hips. He didn’t slow down he kept on kissing me and rubbing my back his hands slipped in underneath my jacket and he felt bear skin, that’s when he groaned and it felt like I was going to cum from no playing with my clit. That for some reason got me out of my haze and I quickly got of his lap and stood next to the table. “Where you going Rossi, it was just getting hot.” “No Dante we can’t I stopped with everyone I can’t take it further with you.” “But do you want to?” I tried to play dumb and asked “Do I want to do what? Do you want to take it further with us?” “Fuck Dante.” I quickly got my handbag and walked to the elevator pressing the button over and over. “Rossi it won’t open until I press this button.” He walked over to me or should I say he was moving towards me like he was hunting his prey. When he stood right in front of me, I asked him “Please Dante let me go.” “Fine Rossi, but I’m walking you to your car.” “It’s not necessary.” “It’s not negotiable Rossi, I’m walking with you.” He opened the lift and I almost ran in. When the doors closed, he pressed me into the corner of the lift and hovered over me with his lips. “Just another taste Rossi, please.” I didn’t say no so he moved closer and kissed me again. Fuck he kissed heavenly it felt like I was flying while he kissed me. The ping from the elevator got both of us out of our stupor but as we turned around George, Gio and Antonio was standing at the open lift doors.

# Blog: Episode 2 – One Day in Dresden | 3 Cities, 3 Journeys



  


>Dresden in a day. I know—it sounds ambitious. But that’s exactly what this was: an architectural marathon through a city that feels like an open-air museum.

>  


>In this second episode of 3 Cities, 3 Journeys, I landed in the heart of Saxony, where every building tells a story and every corner offers a new surprise. Baroque beauty, majestic domes, quiet squares, and echoes of history at every turn.

>  


>In just a few hours, I walked through centuries: the awe-inspiring Frauenkirche, the elegant Zwinger Palace, the grand Semperoper, and the scenic Brühl’s Terrace, also known as the “Balcony of Europe.”

>  


>What struck me most was how this city, nearly wiped out during WWII, rebuilt itself with grace and resilience.

>  


>With a camera in hand, worn-out sneakers, and a cup of coffee along the way, I realized one day is enough to fall for Dresden—but never enough to say goodbye.",1,1750762395.0,Ale_On_The_Map_Travel,0,1.0,False

Kendu is a memecoin backed by a plethora of IRL initiatives including plushies, vapes, vending machines, coffee, energy drinks, murals, Pickleball Competitions and much more....We are currently sitting around 20 million market cap, with around 18.5k holders and we have stood incredibly strong as the rest of the market falls due to the current wars. But anyways, I am not too interested in the wars, I am far more focused on Kendu. Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, the only other coin to achieve this incredible feat was Pepe, yes.....Pepe. The coin that reached 10 billion outside of a bull run, this is bullish af and it shows the true strength of Kendu. We have an incredible social media output, rivalling the most active coins, check X or any memecoin subreddit and you will see Kendu everywhere.

**The next part of the post is for a bit of fun, there are far more factors than this. For example community sentiment, tg activity and many more**

So what makes the Kendu community so active?

The answer is **copious amounts of** ...... **caffeine**

Kendu has energy drinks and coffee, which keeps the Kendu army grinding on even the slowest of days, I myself don't drink coffee, but I drink Kendu Energy.

""How the fuck else would you do this job?""

""Kendu Energy and Kendu Coffee my friend""

**That was stolen from the Wolf of Wall Street, don't sue me lol**

Here is a Kendu chad in action!

But anyways, here is a run down of the different products:

**Kendu Coffee**

Kendu Coffee is sourced through direct trade, this means there is no middle man, to ensure only the best price for the product, the coffee is available in both caffeinated and decaf forms and it is sourced from Brazil. The coffee is available in many different forms: Filter, Espresso, Whole Bean and French Press. For any Cafes or offices you can bulk order the coffee, which is great. For any UK events, there is a portable Kendu Coffee bar, which brings the coffee to you! So any UK based people should be aware of this.

In the future providing that the plants produce beans to a high standard, Kendu Coffee plants will be available.

**Kendu Energy**

Kendu Energy is an energy drink, available in both sugar free and full sugar variants, with a recent redesign, it is looking great. I have tried the full sugar version and would highly recommend it, it tastes more similar to Redbull than Monster and I am buying more shortly! They come in packs of 6, 12 and 20 and they are available worldwide, with a very strong presence in Europe and America. I am also pretty sure there is a new flavour coming out soon, as it has been teased but I don't know what it will be!

**Final Thoughts**

Get yourself on the caffeine grind and join the Kendu army, we are outworking all other projects rn and we all know what happens to the most hardworking communities, they moon..... Shib, Doge and Pepe all had die hard communities, there was nothing special about them, they just worked incredibly hard. This is NFA but Kendu has absolutely 0 risk at these levels and a hell of a lot of potential upside

We just bought our first house! The first four pictures shows the interior of the current owners. The last picture is an AI-generated image of what I want it to look like.

**Current setup**

* Floor: Oak PVC.
* Walls: White spachtelputz (textured plaster) half-painted .
* Furniture: From the current owners, so imagine it's not there.

**Goal**

A calm Japandi look: natural wood, muted palette, clean lines, touch of wabi-sabi. See last image for reference.

**Questions**

* Which wood tone(s) should I use for the main pieces — dining table, sideboard, coffee table — so they read Japandi **without** clashing with the current floor?
* What to do with the spachtelputz walls? Paint? If so, which type of paint and which colour? Or do I need to plaster?

I threatened legal action and got a small settlement, that in retrospect I should have tried to increase. Because 6 months on, I am still unemployed, I am absolutely broke, and the job market is god fucking awful. Maybe it’s just the way things are, or maybe it’s because I have a 6 month gap in my employment because of the absolute fuckery my previous employer pulled.

It’s so frustrating. I know I’m talented. I know I could do amazing things. And yet because I was defined by my disability and punished for it, I’ve ended up with an inconsistent history of work that, fine, may not be the only reason I can’t find a job, but I bet you it certainly doesn’t help. 

I loved my job, I loved my career, and I cannot find my way back into the industry. It’s a fucking nightmare.

I still walk down the street looking at certain feminine looking males

Feminine looking females, I don't differ so much

There are trees and cosmopolitanism with Europeans that have found here some years ago. They sing and drink. They are happy

I find reasons to go to this spiritual shelter. I am used to anguish but I have always felt free. The mountain range helps. I wanted to see the world with this girl. I can, with a male. I can do that with a beautiful one even whom has a soul that feels male, and is not away from masculinity. But I have always preferred things that felt flowery. And even in my appearance with beard and moustache, and shoulders that one could easily call wide, I am close to beauty and far from roughness.

I feel that I wronged her -[24M-23F]- 3 months in, I'm really hung over something special that I accidentally ruined.","This is a story that has been taking a lot on my mind to process for two months now, and God it's what I wake up with my mind on, and she's who I dream of, I just can't break free..

I met this girl through friends. It was a real raw spark.. We started bonding and casually planned for things later. The only thing we had is to talk over DMs and discord, as we're 500km far apart. There was a quick rapport with a mix of jokes, shared interests, lifestyle choices, and spontaneous humor, all blended in, all of which mix and go at a fast pace, making it wholesome and great.

As time progressed, the dialogue turned flirtatious. And explored personal boundaries, some sexual fantasies and even sensitive topics like kinks. (I'm trying to resume something so emotionally dense in few words).

So after waiting for a convenient time to visit each other. It was due! to start our dating phase IRL! with a first one, that seemed to go well, from planning a coffee and a walk, to hanging out for 6 hours & her wanting me to stay the whole night in her city.

Yet, the one thing that got me off guard, she unexpectedly she introduced me to her sister without prior notice before the date. I wasn’t comfortable with meeting family that early, so at the end of the date, I jokingly said, “I'll meet you in another city where your sister won't be around.”

Yet, as it simmered through next day, things backfired. I tried reaching out several times & got hard-walled. Got consufed. Got ghosted me for a month. Eventually, I spoke to a common friend who told me she took what I said as a very rude saying, and took it as I was only interested in her for sex & hooking up and didn’t care about her at all.

When I heard that, I tried to apologize, I felt guilty, but her response was, “What you said was horrible. I rarely see my family, ofc they are my priority. I completely lost interest.” she got so guarded and my friend told me that she was mad 10/10 on scale, and said “That was a date, the only date"" + ""I absolutely didn’t give a f\*ck about him, that the next day, I went on another date with another guy and I don’t give a single shit about him that he doesn’t even cross my mind.”

It sounds to me like someone mad and disgusted by who I was in their mind, rathen than indifferent. I tried again to express that I still cared, even if it was a short time we knew each other. But after that, she blocked me on 2 social medias that I tried to reach on (2 are open). Now the situation seems dead. I know.

But, I fucking.. can't.. get her.. off my mind.. 3rd month in right now.

The potential is so great that I just wanted to be raw on everything, be truthful rather than ""put my attitude with makeup on"", I didn't mean to offend, just to express a boundary in a playful way to keep it low.

WHAT CAN I DO, I feel so trapped in this.. If I visit her city, I'm thinkin to buy black & white flowers + a card and without saying a word, send it to her? Shall I give up? Shall I let time fix things if she felt exposed by my words?? Shall I ask our common friend if my name still triggers her??? What can I do????

PS: she's very attached to her sister, long context, but her sister & mother are her priority.",1,1750760695.0,relationship_advice,5,0.67,False
