1lfr3gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1lfr3gp/new_to_this_and_not_sure_its_doing_anything/,New to this and not sure it's doing anything.,"Hey all, I was just recently prescribed Vyvanse on Monday and am now 3 days into taking it. I haven't really noticed much of a change over the past few days. 

Like I'm definitely not as tired, I read somewhere that you should limit caffeine intake why on stimulants and I was already trying to reduce my reliance on coffee so I just went off it entirely and the Vyvanse definitely helps sustain me for the day. 

But besides that I don't know if it's doing anything. Like I have been more productive the last few days but it's also been a weird few days because I had a leak from my dishwasher that needed to be dealt with.

I'm taking 20mg, and I realize 3 days isn't much information to go off of but if someone could give me some indicators that it's working. I know that's hard because it's probably dependent on the individual, but any information you can provide would be a big help. Thanks! 

Ps. 34m if that matters 🤔

Pps. Also if you have any tips to get the most out of my medication I'd appreciate any help there as well ",1,1750381044.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False
1lfr36t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lfr36t/aita_for_making_my_bf_cut_off_contact_from_his/,AITA for making my bf cut off contact from his creepy friend,"For some backstory, my (F23) bf (M25) have been dating for almost five years. When we first started dating, I became acquainted with one of his friends, let's call him Carl (M30ish). Carl was a family friend of his and we would all hang out quite often. It was also important to note that Carl is on the spectrum. He lives alone and has a full time job and is high functioning. 

Initially, Carl seemed friendly and chill and an overall nice guy. However, this changed over time when he would start making weird jokes like ""I wish I could find myself a cute Asian girl like OP"" (he's white) or would constantly call me at odd times during the day, sometimes to ask me to translate stuff from English into my native tongue for him to learn, or sometimes to ask about me and my boyfriend's sex life (??). In an attempt to be understanding of his lack of social cues and his relationship to my bf, I would stay civil and curt. 

Eventually, we ended up on a trip together where the three of us shared a hotel room. It was my bf and I on one bed, and Carl on the other. My bf normally sleeps in his underwear, and he ended up doing so on this trip, and Carl ended up doing the same. I was admittedly pretty uncomfortable at this point but didn't know how to bring it up. I honestly felt like I was the weird one since the other two seemed so comfortable doing this. I chalked it up to me being sheltered and told myself that everything should be fine, and just went along with it, as this was my first time sharing a hotel room with the opposite gender. 

Two days into the trip however, my bf ends up drinking too much at dinner and passes out on the bed once he gets back. I stayed up to do some work since I had a deadline coming up, and Carl was laying above the covers in just his underwear. To better illustrate our positioning in the room, the desk I am at is right in front of his bed, but if I am turned towards my laptop, I am facing the wall away from him. He starts calling my name to turn around and talk to him and feeling like it would be rude not to, I turned around to engage in conversation with him. He asks if I think my bf is going to wake up and I shake my head, saying he's a heavy sleeper and then turn around once again. He then calls my name again, and this time when I turn, he has his hand in his underwear. I sit in shock for a bit before turning back around. He then proceeds to continue calling my name and asking random questions to get my attention and eventually I just told him I'm really busy so I can't talk anymore. His hands stayed in his underwear for a couple minutes. 

This became a very sore spot in our relationship. When I originally brought it up to my bf, he shrugged it off saying ""maybe his balls were itchy"" and that it might just be an autism thing. He said there's no way Carl would have tried anything since he was also in the room, so I shouldn't worry about it. It took over a year before I told anyone else, and everyone else I told freaked out and said what happened was not okay. 

Around this time, I confided in my cousin (F19) about what happened, and she looked at me in horror before saying that she's actually been dealing with his harassment all this time. Apparently ever since she was introduced to the group, around a year ago, he added her on Snapchat and would make all sorts of comments like how hot/ sexy she looked in her swimsuits, asking to drink with her, and even prying about her sex life or saying how she should tell him everything about the guys that are interested so he can screen them. At this point, I felt super guilty for not protecting my younger cousin from this guy and felt that if I made a scene when something happened to me, maybe this wouldn't have happened to her. 

I ended up telling my bf that this is obviously a pattern of behavior and I don't want him being Carl's friend either anymore. It took me almost two years to realize this was sexual harassment and that my comfort and safety should be a priority. 

My bf ends up confronting Carl about all that happened and instead of apologizing, Carl says we are all liars and just looking for attention and that I am abusive for making him choose between his friend and his girlfriend. 

Fast forward to now, his parents are asking why they haven't hung out and my bf said it is because of what happened. Now, his parents know all the details about what happened because they got angry at me for not being friends with Carl still for ""their sake"" around a year ago. Even after I told them everything they happened, they said ""well it's not like you will have to be in the same room with him alone."" 

After my bf refused to ask Carl out on a coffee hangout, his parents accused me of being abusive and controlling, saying I had no right to tell him who he can or can't hang out with. They said that what happened wasn't sexual harassment and my cousin and I were blowing it out of proportion. They said I could have said no if I didn't like it and that I was taking advantage of my bf and isolating him from all his friends (even though this is the only person I've asked him to cut off). His mother went on to insinuate that being in an abusive relationship could get him killed as well and essentially said that as a woman herself, she doesn't think what happened was a big deal. Apparently, they think I am not being understanding enough of his autism and that I'm a bad influence on their son. They ended up saying they will be forcing this coffee date to happen and will be following up with Carl. 

This is eating me up inside a lot more than I want it to so I figured why not ask a bunch of strangers on the internet? AITA for asking my boyfriend to cut him out of his life?

1lfr15a,https://www.reddit.com/r/myjournalblogspot/comments/1lfr15a/this_was_my_attempt_at_meditating/,This was my attempt at meditating.😂,"I am supposed to go feed the farm animals, but I'm waiting for the weather to cool down a bit before I head over there... Hopefully at 7:00 o'clock it will be better out there for me to go do that...

I'm listening to some Todd Perelmuter teaching me about a path to peace and I'm wondering what application his words, thoughts, and ideas have in my life. 🤔 ? 

I'm wondering if I don't have to hate my spouse? 😟 I'm wondering what is going on with my spouse? What even is our relationship? Do we have one? Do we have a good one? Maybe we just don't even have a relationship at all. 😔 If we have a relationship, it's a weird one. It doesn't feel like a connection to me. It feels like hate. It feels like we don't like each other and we both need space. Or do just I need space?!?!? 😟 I don't know. 😔

Now he's talking about addiction. He says addiction is within us, not the objects of addiction (like junk food 😟). He says it's ravenous desire. We are trying to escape ourselves and our thoughts, he says. We want excitement and stimulation and pleasure. But he says we need to balance this with something else, like composure and presence and using our pleasures to balance us or something. Maybe he's trying to say we just don't need to run away from our thoughts. We can't fill the god sized empty hole in our hearts with these pleasures. We can't just use these pleasures to cover up our pain. We can't use work and coffee and caffeine to cover up our pain and to be running away from ourselves. We need meditation and _____ to help ourselves. Find a sustainable way to work that doesn't drain you. What's your underlying unhappiness? Use meditation and other very positive things like eating salad and going to the gym to bring you more happiness: long term health, well-being and energy, instead of immediate satisfaction and gratification. Be more patient and more present. Observe your thoughts and notice how they affect you in your body. How about when your thought is go get a donut? 🍩 Practice letting cravings come up and don't give in to them. Just neutrally observe it and watch it and don't give in to it. If you do give in to the craving, it will get deeper and stronger in your brain. Think of the success of not giving in to 200+ craving thoughts. That will give you power! You will have power to NOT drink, etc.. Free yourself! Go deeper into life, don't escape. Use the good and the bad; the pleasures and the pains. Stay tranquil and calm through all of it. Truly observe, peacefully, whatever comes into your life. Deal with your scary thoughts. Rely on yourself. Don't escape yourself. Seek freedom from your thoughts, your ego, your cravings, freedom from attachment and clinging, and freedom from resisting and fighting life's pains. Seek freedom to choose, to pause, to control our awareness and direct our focus. 

Hmm. I wonder what I can do to liberate myself. 🤔

He says we need to feel to heal. We don't need to deny when somebody treats us badly. 

I want to ""meditate"" right now. Here are my passing thoughts I'm observing: 

My son is going to be mad at me when he finds out the starling escaped his cage.

How does my body feel? 

Apprehensive, I guess. 😥

I should take the leftovers to the farm animals.

I feel driven.

I'm feeling guilty, I guess. 😟 

It is only 5:46 pm. I'm just laying on the couch. The silence is ringing in my ears. I feel upset that I won't get to lay on the couch and relax like this in the future. 😠 

What is guilt supposed to do for you? I have so much guilt. 😔 I feel guilty for feeling tired. I feel guilty for laying on the couch. I feel guilty for yelling at my son. 😞 I feel guilty for my failure to feel a real good connection with my spouse. I'm scared. What if my connections to my spouse aren't real? What if they aren't? 😟 Then what? Then I don't exist. If all we are is our connections, and I don't have one, then I don't exist. 😔 How does that feel in my body? It feels like terror. 

I'm scared of the food we eat. I'm scared of people. I'm scared that I don't know who I am. I feel all nervous and shaky inside. 

I feel tired.

I feel apprehensive. 

What do I want to do?
Nothing right now. 😑 I went to the doctor office and tried to be friendly to the people there and I felt like they cut me off. Just like my spouse does to me at home. 😞 They don't want me or like me either. 😞😞💔 They don't want to hear from me, at least. At least I made a connection with the dental hygienist today. That felt good, even if it was just for a moment. 🥰 I didn't even make a good connection with my other son and his wife today when they were at my house for lunch, even though I tried. That made me feel stupid. 😞 And right now I feel nervous and apprehensive about it. Tomorrow I'm going to go walking way up the canyon with my friend. It's going to take forever. 😑😞 I'd rather stay home and do nothing. 😟 Why? I don't know. 😔 I guess because I can right now and I'm worried that when my spouse and my son get back home, I won't be able to. Why do you want to stay home and do nothing? I've been too stressed, way too stressed, lately. I just want to relax. I want to relax somewhere where there are no people putting demands on me, or rather, no people for me to imagine I need to put demands on myself for... 😔 Why do 

Interruption: I just read my text messages and now I've lost my train of thought. 😑 How do I feel in my body? I just broke out all over in a sweat and my heart feels like it's pumping funny, but it probably isn't really... 😑 

I'm taking a deep breath. Ahhh. 😌 I think that feels good. It feels peaceful, restful, I think.

I just scratched my butt. 😟

I just breathed in again.

I'm still sweating..

I'm going to continue this on the next slide...

Next slide: 

I'm scared of watching my granddaughter next week. What if something goes wrong? It's a big responsibility. 😔 Why can't my son and daughter-in-law bring their children over to see me for just a few hours at a time, instead of always having to leave them here overnight? 😡 This makes me feel rejected inside. They don't really like me. They just want a babysitting service. Oh well. I like my grandchildren and I want a relationship with them, so I've got to spend time with them so that I can hopefully create a connection with them. Who knows if it will happen. I guess I kind of have faith in my idea, and I kind of believe I'm just doing this for nothing too. 😔 My body feels hopeful, but kind of exhausted with this kind of thing: this ""let's play try to get the people to like me"" game... ☹️ Bullshit! I cry! 😭😩

Well. Now what. I kind of want to eat something. But my tummy is still full from the big pile of food I ate 5 hours ago. 😔😟 

I wonder if I would get overheated if I went to the farm now??? 😟😔 
I wish I didn't have to do the farm chores. 😞 I want to say that I really hate them! 😬 I feel a longing: a longing for the farm chores not to be there. 😟 I feel really unhealthy over there doing these things! The gates are too heavy to lift, I feel unsafe from other human beings, being all alone over there 😟, there are stinging insects in the gates 😞, it is way too hot and the chores take too long, and I already feel like a failure when I consider how much of the garden I still haven't got watered, and how hot the little chicks are... I fear my spouse will be mad at me about it, even though it is not my fault. 😞 This makes me want to go eat another Costco poppyseed muffin. 😟 I kind of want to just hurry over there to the farm to get this shit overwith!!!! 😬😰 And then tomorrow I will waste all of my day waiting on my frickin friend 😖 and then Saturday my family members are already coming home again and then my free time is gone and wasted. 😭 😟 What does this mean? Why would I rather have free time, than spend time with my family? Aren't they nice to me? Maybe not. 😌 I feel a little better now. 🤔🤷🤦 Don't ask me why. 😂 I think I will go over to the farm and get those god damned chores overwith. Too bad nobody wants to hear about all of this about me! 😅😊🤔☹️😟🤷",1,1750380849.0,myjournalblogspot,0,1.0,False

1lfqypc,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1lfqypc/tasting_in_my_interview/,Tasting in my interview,"I am a college student home for the summer, and in my hunt for a job, I landed an interview at Starbucks. I expected the corporate spiel, getting asked questions from a script, and such. I lied that I don’t go to school because most places I’ve been applying to don’t want someone who can only work for a few months. What I didn’t expect was for the interview to start with a coffee tasting.

Crazy coincidence, but I happened to take a coffee tasting class this spring for credit. And of the 30+ coffees we sampled in that class, Starbucks Single-Origin Sumatra was likely the most hated after only Folgers, and most people tossed theirs. Now of course, my first instinct was “This is Starbucks, they’re just doing it for the principal, don’t be a snob or show that you know too much.” And I don’t want to yuck anyone’s yum, but the reality is that it’s mass produced coffee roasted to hell and served stale. It’s pretty hard to enjoy as a plain black coffee, and I think that’s whether you are a coffee aficionado or a noob. Because people who don’t do regular coffee tastings probably won’t enjoy plain drip coffee anyway. 

And there was this rush to it, even though the interview still took at least a half hour. The manager brings out these piping hot cups and immediately wants me to try this coffee without even letting it cool a little. And as soon as I take my first sip, she’s asking what notes I taste and if I feel a tingle (her way of describing acidity?) I just said it tastes like coffee to me, and later that I taste a little cocoa. Again, I was scared to say more and risk coming across as a critic who knows more than her. But yeah, the corporatization of the coffee tasting was pretty awkward. I did my best in the interview and ultimately didn’t get the job. Oh well.

I have a huge crush but not sure if it's just friends for him.,"A guy on Raya liked me. I matched him. We chatted for a few days, super naturally about all the nerdy things we love \[politics, documentaries, music\].

However, on Raya you can be on ""just for friends"" and ""dating"". He had selected ""Just for friends"" and so I took that at face value. He did tell me he was five years separated and had two kids but nothing else he said made it clear what his intent was, so I stuck with friends. But, he's awesome and in a band I love so cool guy to know nonetheless. FWIW: I am 40, he is 48. I am often told I look 32. He is handsome and looks his age. He's a gentle, intellectual, punk rock kinda guy.

We ended saying that if I came to NY I should see him and if he came to LA he should see me. I did not continue to pen pal him but we became Instagram friends. For the past few months any time a photo was posted of me he liked it.

A few months later I'm in NY for an entire month so I reached out and express we should but no rush at all. He was super excited leading up to it. The day I arrived he was as well. ""Excited to meet you 🙌🏻"" he said. He was checking his calendar and then I didn't hear back for over a week. So, I decided, ""f' it"", and reached out to ask ""this week?"". He replied within seconds with ""Hey danielle was just thinking about you glad to hear you're feeling better! \[I had a cold\] What is your Thursday afternoon looking like?""

We ended up meeting today at a coffee shop near him. It was very cute. We sat sorta close because you have to there and we chatted for 1 hour without pause. I went into this thinking definitely not romantic so I wasn't super flirty but I did give him some good eye contact.

He is a slightly awkward dude naturally and I'm ADHD so I can be chatty and meandering. I do think I was nervous and chatted too much but he rolled with it. After 1 hour he said, ""A book came for me today at a bookstore nearby, do you want to walk with me to pick it up?"". I said yes and we walked there. The conversation flowed and it was a sweet walk.

We got there and he paused by the books on display. He picked one up I pointed to and had us read the back together. Then he eventually went to get his book while I looked at others. I noticed he didn't interrupt me once he got the book, he just went to look around and waited till I was done. Then we had some more close chatting about our favorite bands rn. Our favorite books. He said he'd send me a song.

As we started to walk out I realized how long it had been, now one and a half hours, and I had a lot of work to do. I sweetly said, ""I don't want to take up too much of your time, and I also have some work to finish."" He says, ""Ah yes I had planned to record some things today."" I say, ""I'll take a car and he says, ""Oh you will call a car?"" and I honestly think it's just awkward in this moment. We're fumbling on words. He looks like he's just going to say bye and start walking away so I go to give him a friendly hug and we agree it had been nice.

**While I'm clear this could easily just be a platonic hang still, I wonder what a guy would say hearing this playback. What could have he been thinking?**

After hounding my manager for a while, I managed to get information on becoming a coffee master since, in general, I’ve been hearing mixed things. But basically, it went down to attending four classes being hosted by one of the other store managers in my district. I just started the first class a couple of days ago, and it was really awesome. They had three reserve coffees and one that might be reserve, but it’s called Hacienda Alsacia, I believe. From what we were told, it had different roasts but under the same name, and we happened to have the one considered as a medium roast. Anyways, back to the topic.

I wanted to know if this is standard in other places or is this unique to my district? It’s pretty cool, but I haven’t seen anything in an official capacity about similar things. Anyways, I would love some tips from you guys if you could instruct me on them. I got my hands on the Coffee Academy 300: Roast and Blend book and the three set Coffee Academy activity cards for all the sections of the Coffee Academy 300. I’ve been working on memorizing the different facts about the coffees and working on flashcards as well.

Minimal set with only the two chairs and a coffee table in between them with the questions on cards. One asks the other a question (could be something like, ""What did you think of me when you first met me?"", etc) and they take turns with different questions

I'm not sure who else would understand, but I'll go ahead anyway. I would appreciate your help. Talk me out of this. Or please talk me into this. Either way, this feels too good to be true.

After getting sucked in by the middle age Love And Deepspace (LADS) daddies (This is a Otome game that is marketed towards woman, and you are allowed to romance several love interests. And for those in the know, yes, the ads got me!) and playing the game, I (28F) broke up with my ex (27M) during Summer 2024 after I realized that my ex didn't even do bare minimum efforts for our relationship. For example, my ex told me he felt insecure that I paid for most things, but when I did ask for his consideration, he would cry and break down, telling me I was being unfair to ask him to pay for lunch since I paid for 90% of everything from our vacations to food and little things. 

During the breakup, my ex pleaded with me to wait for him and to reconsider our breakup. I agreed, saying that we could be on a break because I was scared of losing this guy after six years of being together, and I was a fool. While I was waiting for him like he asked, Ex got together with his close female friend, and they did the dirty about two weeks after he asked me to reconsider our breakup.

I was destroyed emotionally and mentally when he told me that he had found another girl at the right time and place, and that we wouldn't work out because he loves this other woman.

Fast forward to spring of 2025, I'm working on myself, and I get deeper and deeper into LADS. I am not looking for anything because why would I want anything when I have the LADS men!!

The individual in question will be referred to as Resident (27M) because he has just completed medical school and is now seeking his residency. I met Resident during a hobby hangout around Fall 2024 after my breakup, and he told me he plays a game (that is not LADS) like I do, and he would like to play sometimes if I am interested. I am polite and I exchange Discords with him, and he sends me his username for the game. Some time passes, and we don't play the game he initially asked me about. It's quiet, and we don't exchange more words beyond hello and goodbyes after that. We continue going to this hobby hangout place, but he's not there very often. Of the few times Resident is there, he eventually mentions a C-drama, and we engage in a brief conversation about it, but it remains polite.

Then another friend of the hobby hangout place asked me more about how my ""pixel love"" was going because my friend doesn't know or remember the name of LADS, and I answered. Resident then quietly mentions he knows about LADs, and this is the start of a very fast and friendly friendship.

He told me about how he knows about LADS, and he doesn't play it. Still, he knows about Caleb (one of the love interests) because another one of his friends plays it and has expressed to him that she finds the Caleb and MC relationship of ""gege/meimei"" disgusting, even though Caleb is her main love interest. Resident then explains that he was explaining to her what it meant in Chinese culture, and etc.

Long story short, we begin meeting up almost every weekend he is free, whether it is at a coffee house or a library, because I freak out and gush to him about LADS and many other things to him. We talk every day, and it is mutual from both sides. I send him stuff about LADS, I tell him about the story, and how it's different for every LI. He then begins playing LADS, as he says he wants to know more about this game that I love.

He begins working on Zayne (another love interest) for his playthrough. We talk about C-dramas. We play different games together. We start seeing each other outside of games and hobby hangout place. We take walks together at the park like twice or three times a week. We go to the gym together like three times a week.

I start to get the sense that Resident has a tiny crush on me, or that he is just extremely comfortable because he is being very flirty with me - like he starts calling me ""pretty,"" ""cute,"" and other things. I don't want to overthink, so I straight up ask him what the deal is. He admits that he has been attracted to me for a while and wants to pursue a relationship beyond being friends. Resident says he is okay with me not being attracted to him and that being friends is ok, but that he can't help but like me and want something more.

This guy is such a green flag that I feel undeserving of such attention. He loves his parents and is respectful to everyone. He believes in equality, is super educated, and he is so caring and soft. He loves romance novels and likes reading. The qualities he has are what I want to be the standard for every person. I showed him how shameless I can be for digital men. I snort and laugh too loudly in front of him.

What do I do? Talk me out of this. I don't want to ruin anything. Is it too early to start another relationship? I have been out of a relationship for a year now. 

TLDR: A fantastic man says he likes me and wants to be more than friends - I don't want to ruin anything because I feel undeserving. Is it too soon to start a new relationship?",1,1750380117.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

Haven’t texted or spoke to since then, which hurts but I know I need to give her space. I’m still really into her, and obviously would love to see where things could go between us if she’s ready; how can I be supportive and still friendly but give that space needed to figure things out so she can decide if she WANTS me or just liked having me around?

Bartholomew ""Barty"" Buttercup was, by all accounts, an unremarkable man. He had a job in accounts (the irony wasn't lost on him, though he rarely mentioned it), a slightly lopsided houseplant he'd named Susan (after an ex who also leaned a bit), and a digestive system that could charitably be described as… expressive.



The fateful Tuesday began like any other. Barty had consumed his usual breakfast: a bowl of ""Fiber Fiesta"" cereal (the box promised a party in his colon, a promise it always kept with gusto) and a lukewarm cup of instant coffee that tasted vaguely of burnt toast and regret. The morning commute was a symphony of honking horns and Barty's own internal rumbles, a percussive prelude to the day's main event.



It happened at precisely 11:03 AM.



Barty was hunched over his ergonomic keyboard, wrestling with a spreadsheet that seemed to have a personal vendetta against him. He'd been holding it in, a familiar pressure building, a gaseous grumbling that had been his constant companion since the Fiber Fiesta. He’d tried shifting in his chair, clenching, even humming the national anthem under his breath (a trick his grandma swore by, though its efficacy was dubious).



But this one… this one was different. It wasn't just a casual toot, a fleeting whisper of wind. This was the Moby Dick of farts, the Big Kahuna, the one you tell your grandkids about, assuming your grandkids aren't too horrified to listen.



He felt it coming like a runaway freight train, a seismic event brewing in his lower intestine. There was no stopping it. He squeezed his eyes shut, braced his hands on his desk, and surrendered.



The sound that ripped from him was… monumental. It wasn't a sharp crack, nor a bubbly squeak. It was a deep, resonant, baritone BROOOOOOOM that seemed to vibrate the very fillings in his teeth. The office, a typically bustling hive of keyboard clicks and hushed phone calls, fell silent. Utterly, completely silent.



Barty’s face burned hotter than a thousand suns. He dared to crack an eye open. Brenda from HR, a woman whose face was perpetually set in an expression of mild disapproval, was staring at him, her mouth agape, a half-eaten custard cream frozen halfway to her lips. Kevin from IT, who usually communicated only in grunts and binary code, had actually swiveled his chair around, his eyes wide with something akin to awe, or possibly terror. Even Mr. Grumbles, the perpetually grumpy office manager whose office door was always closed, had poked his head out, his comb-over slightly askew.



Time seemed to stretch, each second a tiny, agonizing eternity. Barty wanted the earth to open up and swallow him whole, or at least for his ergonomic chair to develop a sudden, powerful ejector seat.



Then, the smell hit.



It was… indescribable. Imagine, if you will, the unholy union of a forgotten gym sock, a family of badgers who’d taken up competitive cheese-eating, and the lingering aroma of a science experiment gone terribly, terribly wrong. It was a smell that didn't just offend the nostrils; it assaulted them, took them hostage, and then performed unspeakable acts upon their delicate sensibilities.



Brenda made a small, choked sound and fumbled for her emergency can of air freshener, the one labeled ""Ocean Breeze"" which, in this context, felt like a cruel, ironic joke. Kevin actually gagged. Mr. Grumbles slammed his door shut with a force that rattled the motivational posters on the wall.



Barty, meanwhile, was trying to become one with his chair. He wished he could retract his head into his torso like a terrified turtle. ""Excuse me,"" he mumbled, his voice a strangled whisper.



But it wasn't over. Oh no, it was just beginning.



As the initial shockwave of the scent began to (theoretically) dissipate – though ""mutate"" might have been a more accurate term – something strange happened. The fluorescent lights above Barty's desk flickered. Once, twice, then went out completely, plunging his little cubicle into semi-darkness.



""Great,"" Barty muttered, ""Now I've broken the lights.""



He jiggled the switch. Nothing. He was about to call for Kevin, who despite his current state of olfactory shock was usually good with these things, when he noticed it.



The air around his desk, where the epicenter of the… event… had been, seemed… thicker. The potent aroma hadn't just lingered; it seemed to be congealing. Patches of the air shimmered, like heat haze on asphalt, but with a sickly, greenish-brown tint. The light from the hallway seemed to bend and warp as it passed through these patches.



Barty stared, his earlier embarrassment momentarily forgotten, replaced by a creeping, icy tendril of unease. ""What in the…""



The shimmering patches began to coalesce, drawing together like malevolent droplets of oil on water. The smell intensified again, but now it carried a new note, something acrid and almost… hungry. Slowly, a visible form began to take shape in the dim light of his cubicle. It was roughly spherical, about the size of a beach ball, and it pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence that was a nauseating blend of swamp gas and old cheese. It was, unmistakably, the fart. His fart. And it was looking at him. Or at least, it gave that distinct impression.



A low, guttural gurgle emanated from the cloud, a sound like air escaping a long-sealed tomb, or perhaps just very, very bad indigestion amplified a thousand times. It bobbed in the air, then drifted slowly, purposefully, out of his cubicle and into the main office area.



Brenda, who had just managed to take a shaky sip of water, saw it first. Her eyes widened, her face turned a shade paler than her custard cream, and she let out a shriek that could curdle milk. The cloud, Barty's monstrous, sentient fart-cloud, seemed to quiver at the sound, almost like it was pleased.



It then drifted towards Kevin's workstation. Kevin, still looking a bit green around the gills, was trying to reboot his computer. The cloud enveloped his monitor, and the screen instantly fizzled, emitting a shower of sparks before going completely black. Kevin yelped and scrambled back, tripping over his chair.



The cloud let out another wet, gurgling sound, which Barty was beginning to interpret as a chuckle.



His life, Barty suddenly realized with a chilling certainty that had nothing to do with residual flatulence, would never, ever be the same. And as his airborne abomination began to slowly drift towards Mr. Grumbles' closed door, pulsing with noxious intent, Barty had a sinking feeling that ""different"" was going to involve a lot more than just office apologies. This wasn't just a bad smell; it was a bad omen, a gaseous demon he'd unwittingly unleashed upon his unsuspecting colleagues.





Chapter 2: The Brown Note



The sentient fart cloud, which Barty was starting to think of as ""The Aftermath,"" didn't bother with the niceties of knocking. It simply seeped under Mr. Grumbles' office door, a noxious tendril of greenish-brown vapor leading the charge. A moment later, a muffled yelp echoed from within, followed by a series of increasingly frantic thumps and a sound like a walrus gargling gravel.



Barty, Brenda, and Kevin exchanged horrified glances. Brenda was clutching her ""Ocean Breeze"" can like a holy relic, though its power seemed woefully inadequate against this particular brand of evil. Kevin, ever the pragmatist, was already halfway under his desk, muttering about network protocols and the sudden, inexplicable urge to invest in a gas mask.



Then, from Mr. Grumbles' office, came a new sound. It was a low, continuous rumble, like a distant thunderstorm, but somehow… wetter. The rumble grew in intensity, punctuated by strained groans and the distinct creak of an office chair under immense pressure.



""What's it doing to him?"" Brenda whispered, her voice trembling.



Barty didn't want to know. He really, really didn't. But a morbid curiosity, mixed with a dawning sense of responsibility (it was his fart, after all), kept him rooted to the spot.



The rumbling reached a crescendo, a truly earth-shattering (or perhaps trouser-shattering) roar that made the previous BROOOOOOOM sound like a polite cough. It was followed by a series of smaller, sputtering pops, then a long, drawn-out, deflating hiss. And then… silence. A heavy, ominous silence that was somehow worse than the cacophony that had preceded it.



The Aftermath oozed back out from under Mr. Grumbles' door. It seemed… larger. And somehow, smugger. It pulsed with a triumphant, sickly green light, and the gurgling sound it emitted now had a distinctly satisfied, almost purring quality.



It drifted slowly towards Brenda.



""No,"" she whimpered, backing away, spraying a desperate cloud of Ocean Breeze in its path. The Aftermath seemed to inhale the floral scent, and for a terrifying moment, Barty thought it might actually smile. Or whatever the gaseous equivalent of a smile was. Instead, it let out a sound like a wet balloon animal being twisted into an obscene shape, and the Ocean Breeze scent was instantly overpowered by its own signature stench, now somehow even more potent.



Brenda stumbled, her eyes wide with terror. The Aftermath enveloped her.



What happened next was both horrifying and deeply, deeply undignified. Brenda, a woman who prided herself on her composure and her meticulously organized spice rack, began to… well, she began to fart. Not just one or two, but a continuous, unrelenting barrage, each one more violent and explosive than the last. Her face contorted, first in shock, then in agony, then in a strange, gassy ecstasy. She clutched her stomach, her body convulsing with each internal detonation. The air around her thickened with a new, uniquely Brenda-esque aroma that mingled tragically with The Aftermath's own foulness.



""It's… it's making her…"" Kevin stammered from under his desk, his voice muffled.



""Fart herself to death?"" Barty finished, his own stomach churning. It was absurd. It was grotesque. It was also, undeniably, happening.



Brenda's eyes rolled back in her head. A final, monumental eruption escaped her, a sound that seemed to shake the very foundations of the building, and then she collapsed, a faint plume of her own making rising from her still form. The Aftermath pulsed again, absorbing the essence of Brenda's final, fatal flatulence, growing slightly larger, its greenish hue deepening.



It turned its attention to Kevin's desk.



""No, no, no, no!"" Kevin shrieked, scrambling further under his desk, which offered about as much protection as a paper umbrella in a hurricane. ""I'm just IT! I fix things! I don't… I don't do this!""



The Aftermath, however, was not interested in his job description. It seeped around the desk, its tendrils exploring, seeking. Barty knew he had to do something. This was his creation, his monstrous, gaseous offspring. He couldn't just stand by and watch it decimate the entire accounts department.



But what could he do? You couldn't punch a fart. You couldn't reason with it. Could you… apologize to it?



""Look,"" Barty began, his voice surprisingly steady, ""I'm… I'm sorry. That was me. My fault. Fiber Fiesta, you know? Maybe we can talk about this?""



The Aftermath paused in its pursuit of Kevin. It swiveled its bulk (if a cloud can be said to have bulk) towards Barty. It emitted a low, questioning gurgle.



Barty took a hesitant step forward. ""You don't have to do this. They're innocent! Well, mostly innocent. Mr. Grumbles did steal my stapler once, but…""



The Aftermath let out an impatient, bubbling hiss. It clearly wasn't interested in office politics or petty theft. It wanted… something else. And as it began to drift towards Barty, its sickly green light pulsing with a predatory hunger, Barty had a terrible, sinking feeling he knew exactly what that was. It had come from him. And it seemed determined to make everyone else experience the same explosive fate.



His life, he thought with a fresh wave of horror, was not only never going to be the same, it might also be very, very short.







Chapter 3: The Cycle



The Aftermath loomed, a pulsating sphere of noxious intent, its sickly green light casting an unnatural pallor on Barty's already pale face. It had consumed the essence of Mr. Grumbles and Brenda, growing stronger, more potent, its low gurgle now carrying a distinct, almost musical quality that was deeply unsettling. Kevin remained frozen under his desk, a muffled whimper occasionally escaping his hiding spot.



""Okay, look,"" Barty said again, backing away slowly, his hands held up defensively. ""This is… unexpected. For both of us, I assume? I mean, I didn't plan this. It just… happened. Spicy Fiber Fiesta, maybe? They added ghost peppers this season, I think.""



The Aftermath didn't respond with words, but its gurgling intensified, sounding less like a chuckle and more like a hungry growl. It drifted closer, the air around Barty becoming thick and cloying, filled with the concentrated aroma of his own digestive failure, now amplified to cosmic proportions.



He could feel it now, a strange resonance. It was like standing too close to a powerful speaker, the bass vibrating in his chest, but this vibration was deeper, centered in his gut, a mirror image of the rumbling he’d felt moments before the ""Big One.""



The cloud reached him, enveloping him in its foul embrace. Barty squeezed his eyes shut, bracing himself for the inevitable, explosive, undignified end that had befallen Brenda and, presumably, Mr. Grumbles. He waited for the internal detonations, the uncontrollable release, the final, fatal fart.



But it didn't come.



Instead, the cloud seemed to… settle around him. The intense smell remained, overwhelming his senses, but it didn't trigger the violent expulsion he expected. It was more like being submerged in warm, incredibly putrid bathwater.



Then, the vibration intensified. It wasn't just in his chest now; it was everywhere, coursing through his veins, his bones, the very core of his being. It felt like his internal organs were being gently but firmly massaged by a thousand tiny, gassy hands.



And then, he felt it. A faint, almost imperceptible tugging sensation. It was coming from the cloud, and it was directed inward, towards him.



It was trying to pull him in.



Not physically, not like a vacuum, but something deeper, more fundamental. It was like his own essence, his very being, was being drawn out, absorbed into the gaseous form that had originated within him.



Panic flared, hot and sharp, cutting through the thick fog of the smell. He thrashed instinctively, trying to push the cloud away, but his hands passed through it as if it were just smoke, albeit incredibly foul-smelling smoke.



The tugging grew stronger. He could feel his energy draining, his thoughts becoming sluggish. Images flickered in his mind – the Fiber Fiesta box, Susan the lopsided plant, the spreadsheet that had started it all, Brenda's horrified face, Kevin's panicked scramble. Fragments of his unremarkable life, being pulled away.



A new sensation bloomed in his gut, not the painful pressure that preceded the Big One, but a strange, empty ache, like a void was forming inside him. The Aftermath pulsed with a brighter, more vibrant green light, its gurgling taking on a triumphant, almost joyous tone.



Barty realized, with a sickening certainty, what was happening. His creation wasn't just killing others with flatulence; it was consuming their essence, adding their gassy remains to its own mass. And now, it was returning to its source, not to destroy him, but to reintegrate. To absorb the very person from whom it had sprung.



He was being reabsorbed by his own fart.



The thought was so utterly bizarre, so profoundly humiliating, that it almost overshadowed the terror. He, Bartholomew ""Barty"" Buttercup, was being assimilated by an airborne abomination of his own making. His legacy wouldn't be his accounts work or his slightly sad houseplant, but this… this monstrous cloud of digestive byproduct.



His vision began to dim, the office around him fading into a swirling vortex of greenish-brown. The gurgling sound seemed to fill his head, echoing in the newfound emptiness within him. He could feel himself shrinking, his form dissolving, becoming one with the pungent cloud.



His last coherent thought, before his consciousness dissolved entirely into the collective gaseous consciousness of The Aftermath, was a faint, resigned sigh.



Kevin, still cowering under his desk, finally dared to peek out. The large, pulsating green cloud hovered where Barty had stood moments before. It seemed different now, larger, its light more intense, its gurgling sound a complex symphony of past meals and departed souls. It slowly drifted away from Barty's empty chair, towards the next cubicle, towards the unsuspecting occupants of the floor above, ready to continue its cycle of absorption and expansion.



Bartholomew Buttercup was gone. Only The Aftermath remained, a monument to a truly epic case of indigestion and the unexpected, terrifying consequences of a Fiber Fiesta gone wrong. The age of Barty was over. The age of The Aftermath had just begun.

The perspective is fixed, pointing towards a desk in a cluttered, lived-in room. Bookshelves, papers, coffee mugs are scattered around.



DOUG WEST (40s), wearing a comfortable, slightly worn t-shirt, sits at the desk, looking directly into the webcam lens. He has a friendly, if a little tired, face. Behind him, a TELEVISION is on, the volume low, displaying a news channel. He gestures vaguely around the room.



Doug speaks directly to the camera: ""Hey, folks. Not much to report today. Standard routine, you know? Woke up, had my daily wrestling match with the coffee maker – spoiler alert, it won, left me with lukewarm disappointment again."" He sighs dramatically, then grins. ""Did some puttering in the garden, though. You would not believe the zucchini this year. Seriously, they're like sentient green blimps. I'm gonna have to start giving them away at the side of the road, maybe set up a little 'Free Zucchini' stand before they take over the house.""



He gestures vaguely around the room. ""Read a bit. Tried to focus, anyway. And, well..."" His eyes drift towards the low hum coming from the corner. ""Watched... you know... watched the news."" The TV is on, muted mostly, just the endless scroll of the news chyron providing a quiet backdrop.



Suddenly, a sound cuts through the room – a loud, electronic TONE blares from the TV SPEAKERS. The image on the screen changes to a stark graphic: a red triangle, text overlaid. Doug's head snaps towards it. His smile vanishes, replaced by a frown of confusion.



Doug says to the camera: ""Huh? What's that?""



The alert graphic disappears as quickly as it came, replaced by a NEWSCASTER with a face etched with seriousness. Doug leans forward, listening intently, trying to catch the low volume.



The newscaster's voice is clearer now, though still muffled. ""...We are interrupting this broadcast for an urgent emergency alert. Reports are coming in of a major train derailment approximately fifty miles west of the city. Preliminary information indicates a significant chemical spill from several ruptured tanker cars. Authorities are reporting extremely unusual and aggressive behavior from local insect populations in the affected area, believed to be a direct result of exposure to the spilled chemicals. Residents within a seventy-five mile radius are strongly advised to shelter in place immediately and seal all entry points to their homes...""



Slowly, Doug pushes his chair back, the legs scraping on the wooden floor. He stands and moves out of the webcam's view, presumably heading towards a window behind his desk. The camera remains fixed on the empty chair and the now-ominous TV screen.



The newscaster's voice continues, the image on the TV now showing a distant, shaky shot of a dark plume of smoke on the horizon.



Off-screen, Doug's VOICE is heard, sharp with surprise, followed by a choked GASP.



Doug reappears in the frame, but only to grab the laptop. He lifts it, turning the webcam's view. The image swivels wildly for a moment before settling on the view through a window behind where his desk was.



Rising above the distant treeline is a colossal, inky BLACK PLUME of smoke. It's vast and seems to pulse slightly against the sky. Doug's hand, gripping the laptop, is visible at the edge of the frame, trembling.



Doug quickly moves back to the desk, placing the laptop down. The webcam view is back on him. He sinks into his chair, his face pale, eyes wide with shock as he stares at the camera. The newscaster's voice from the TV is louder now, more urgent. ""...advising residents to stay indoors...""



The TV screen cuts to a REPORTER, ANNA, standing near bright YELLOW POLICE TAPE. Figures in bulky WHITE HAZMAT SUITS are visible in the background.



Doug says to the camera: ""They're saying hazmat suits. What could possibly require hazmat suits...?""



Anna's voice comes through the TV, strained. ""Anna, reporting live from the perimeter established near the derailment site. As you can see behind me, hazmat teams are on the ground, assessing the situation. The air here is thick with a strange odor, and we're seeing unprecedented insect activity. Swarms, unlike anything I've ever witnessed, are behaving erratically, showing no fear of humans or the hazmat crews.

Authorities are struggling to contain the affected zone as the swarms appear to be expanding rapidly...""



Behind Anna, the HAZMAT SUIT figures suddenly stop and point towards something off-screen. Shouts are heard. Anna's eyes widen in sudden TERROR. She gasps, turning her head.



People in HAZMAT SUITS begin SCREAMING, a high-pitched, panicked sound, and start running frantically past Anna, away from something unseen. Anna herself freezes for a second, her mouth agape, before she, too, turns to run.



For a split second, a large, indistinct DARK MASS seems to boil and surge behind the fleeing figures before the TV FEED CUTS OUT.



The screen goes black for a moment, then the EMERGENCY ALERT graphic returns, the electronic TONE blaring again.



Doug is still staring at the webcam, his face slack with shock. He slowly shakes his head, muttering to the camera: ""What was that? What was happening? Anna...""



He listens. The BLARING TONE from the TV is loud, but underneath it, a new sound begins to emerge from outside – a low, growing ROAR, like distant thunder, but constant.



He reaches out, grabs the laptop again. The webcam swivels, pointing back towards the window behind the desk.



The view is the window pane. Outside is dark, indistinct. The sun must have been blocked out by that... plume.



Doug says to the camera, his voice suddenly sharp, laced with alarm: ""It's getting louder. What is that sound? It's not thunder..."" His hand holding the laptop shakes violently.



Suddenly, loud, wet SPLAT sounds begin hitting the glass. Dark shapes SLAM into the window pane. SPLAT! SPLAT! SPLAT! Rapid-fire impacts.



Doug exclaims to the camera: ""What the hell?!"" Dark, viscous liquid and indistinct organic matter smears across the glass with each impact. More SPLATs follow, faster and faster.



The webcam view shifts slightly upwards, showing the sky outside the window. It is no longer visible. The entire view is filled with a churning, SOLID BLACK MASS. Insects, millions upon millions, a thick, moving cloud that blots out the light.



Doug says to the camera: ""Oh god, it's... it's bugs! It's a swarm!""



The window pane is rapidly turning OPAQUE from the constant barrage of impacts and resulting GORE. Within seconds, the outside is completely obscured by a thick, black and brownish film.



Doug places the laptop back on the desk, but doesn't sit. He is standing, his breathing ragged, eyes wide with pure terror, staring at the camera. The EMERGENCY ALERT TONE is still blaring from the TV, but it's being rapidly drowned out by the new, overwhelming sound from outside: the deafening ROAR of millions of insects hitting the house. It sounds like a HURRICANE, a constant, percussive DRUMMING on the walls, the roof, the windows.



Doug starts to pace the small area in front of his desk, frantic, running his hands through his hair. He mutters to the camera: ""They're everywhere! They're on the house! What do I do?!""



The SOUND outside intensifies. A high-pitched SCRAPING joins the drumming, the sound of chitinous bodies against wood and glass.



A sickening GROAN comes from the window behind him. The glass PANE visibly BOWS INWARD, flexing under the impossible pressure of the swarm.



Doug says, horrified: ""No... no, no, no..."" He whips around, staring at the window.



Another sickening GROAN. CRACKS spiderweb across the bowing glass.



Suddenly, the LIGHTS in the room FLICKER and DIE. The TV SCREEN goes BLACK, the emergency alert TONE cutting off abruptly. The only light is the faint GLOW from the laptop screen illuminating Doug's terrified face.



The incredible SOUND of the swarm outside continues, now the only sound besides Doug's gasping breaths.



CRACK! The glass in the window SHATTERS inward.



The sound of breaking glass is instantly overwhelmed by a ROARING FLOOD of insects. Black, buzzing, clicking bodies POUR through the broken window opening, a torrent of life.



Doug FLINGS his arms up, stumbling backward away from the desk and the camera. He is immediately enveloped in the mass of the swarm.



His SCREAM is cut off, replaced by a choked, garbled GURGLE as the insects overwhelm him, pouring into his mouth and throat. His body thrashes briefly just outside the edge of the webcam's view, a chaotic, indistinct struggle in the dim light.



The camera view is now mostly filled with a writhing, buzzing carpet of insects pouring across the floor and objects in the room. The SOUND is deafening – a million tiny bodies moving, clicking, buzzing.



Doug's struggling ceases. The garbled sounds stop.



The laptop camera continues to record, pointing at the floor and the encroaching swarm. The sound of the insects fills the audio.

1lfqp24,https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorTalesCommunity/comments/1lfqp24/feedback_loop/,Feedback Loop,"Mark Thorne was a creature of the night, not literally, but by habit. He wrote his best horror stories between midnight and dawn, fueled by lukewarm coffee and the unsettling quiet of his small apartment. For months, he'd been posting his most disturbing tales on r/scarystories, watching the upvotes climb and the comments roll in – praise, critique, and the occasional ""Nope, nope, nope, turning off the lights now."" He thrived on the fear he could conjure in others, a strange validation for the anxieties that often clawed at him in the dark.



His latest piece, ""The Man Who Wore My Face,"" was a hit. It detailed a doppelganger who slowly, subtly, replaced the protagonist, starting with mimicking his habits, then his voice, and finally, his very appearance. The final line, ""I saw him in the mirror this morning, and he smiled back with my teeth,"" had earned dozens of chilling emojis and comments like ""Absolutely terrifying, felt like I was looking over my own shoulder.""



That night, Mark felt a strange chill, unrelated to the draft from his window. He was making his usual midnight coffee when he noticed it – the sugar bowl wasn't where he always kept it. It was a small thing, insignificant, but it snagged on his attention like a loose thread. He shrugged it off. Maybe he'd moved it absentmindedly while lost in thought, a common occurrence during his writing jags.



The next morning, he reached for his favorite mug, the chipped one with the faded band logo that fit perfectly in his hand. It wasn't there. Instead, a perfectly plain, new mug sat on the drying rack, gleaming under the harsh kitchen light. A flicker of unease. He never used plain mugs. He had a collection, each with its own history and comfort. This felt alien. He searched the cupboards, a growing knot in his stomach, but the chipped mug was gone.



Over the next few days, the small, familiar details of his life began to shift with an unnerving frequency. The toothpaste was a different brand, the one he actively disliked. His worn armchair had a new throw pillow he didn't recognize, a floral pattern that clashed horribly with his minimalist decor. The books on his shelf were subtly rearranged, not in the meticulous, genre-sorted order he preferred, but by height, a chaotic, meaningless jumble. Each change was minor, easily dismissed in isolation, but the cumulative effect was like a growing static in his mind, a constant, low-level hum of wrongness.



He started double-checking everything. He'd leave a book on his nightstand, only to find it on the coffee table hours later. He'd put his keys in the bowl by the door, then discover them in his jacket pocket, even though he hadn't worn the jacket. He began to question his own memory, his own sanity. Was he sleepwalking? Was he just incredibly forgetful? The possibilities offered little comfort.



He tried to write, to lose himself in the fictional horrors he controlled, but the words felt wrong, stilted, like a bad imitation of his own style. He looked at his reflection in the dark screen of his laptop, searching for something, anything, out of place. His face seemed… normal. Too normal, perhaps, lacking the familiar lines of fatigue and the slightly haunted look that usually resided there.



Then came the comments on his story, echoing the growing disquiet in his own life.



""Dude, this feels so real. Like, uncomfortably real.""



""Are you okay, Mark? This one feels... personal. Everything alright?""



""Getting serious uncanny valley vibes from this. Like it's happening to me. Anyone else?""



He dismissed them as readers getting caught up in the fiction, their imaginations running wild. But the feeling persisted. The feeling of being slightly off-key in his own life, a performance where he'd forgotten his lines.



He started avoiding mirrors. The brief, involuntary glimpses were enough to send a jolt of adrenaline through him. He caught sight of himself in a shop window and felt a strange sense of detachment, as if the person looking back wasn't quite him.



One evening, the compulsion became too strong. He stood in his bathroom, the harsh fluorescent light buzzing overhead, and stared at his reflection. He brushed his teeth, his movements precise, deliberate. He finished, rinsed, and then, just as he was about to turn away, he saw it. The reflection in the mirror didn't move immediately when he did. There was a fractional delay, a tiny, almost imperceptible lag, like a poorly synced video feed.



His blood ran cold. He moved his hand; the reflection followed, a beat late. He smiled, a forced, trembling smile that felt alien on his lips. The reflection's smile bloomed a moment later, wider, colder, showing just a little too much tooth, a predatory glint in the eyes that mirrored his own.



He stumbled back, heart hammering against his ribs, the toothpaste foam forgotten on his chin. He looked again, blinking rapidly. The reflection was perfectly synchronized now, his own terrified face staring back, eyes wide with a dawning horror. He must be exhausted. Hallucinating. The stress was getting to him.



He splashed cold water on his face, trying to clear his head. He told himself it was nothing, a trick of the light, a tired mind playing games. He went to bed, but sleep wouldn't come. He lay there, rigid under the covers, listening to the sounds of his apartment. The familiar creaks and groans of an old building settling for the night. But tonight, they sounded different. Deliberate. Footsteps overhead where there should be none. A faint scratching sound from within the walls.



He heard a floorboard creak just outside his bedroom door. He froze, every muscle tensed. He lived alone. There was no one else in the apartment.



Another creak, closer this time. Then another, slow and measured, moving towards his door.



He held his breath, straining his ears, the sound of his own heartbeat deafening in the silence. The doorknob began to turn, slowly, silently, the metal groaning softly in protest.



Panic seized him, a cold, suffocating wave. He scrambled out of bed, fumbling for his phone on the nightstand. He had to call someone. The police. A friend. Anyone.



The door opened a crack, revealing a sliver of impenetrable darkness.



He saw it then. Just a sliver of a face in the gap. It was his face, undeniably his. But the eyes weren't his. They were too bright, too empty, devoid of any warmth or recognition, like polished glass.



He backed away until his back hit the cold wall, the phone slipping from his trembling fingers to clatter on the floor. The door opened fully, revealing the figure standing there. It was him, wearing his pajamas, his messy hair, his face.



The figure raised a hand, his hand, and waved slowly, a chillingly casual gesture.



Then, it smiled.



And Mark Thorne saw his own teeth smiling back at him from the face of the thing that had taken his place. The feedback loop was complete. He had written his own nightmare into existence, and now, it was time for the sequel, a terrifying reality he was trapped in, with no escape, no audience, just the chilling knowledge that the man who wore his face was now living his life.",1,1750379840.0,HorrorTalesCommunity,0,1.0,False

Elias Thorne, a writer whose career had stalled somewhere between 'promising' and 'utterly forgotten,' found the list tucked inside a used copy of 'Finnegans Wake' he'd bought for intellectual window dressing. It wasn't just a list; it was the list, or so the faded, elegant script at the top proclaimed: ""Rules for Composing the Narrative Concerning the Rules for Composing the Narrative Concerning the Rules..."" The title itself seemed to loop back on itself, a snake eating its own tail in calligraphic form.



He blinked, a fine layer of dust tickling his nose. The paper felt cool and slightly brittle, like ancient parchment, despite being folded into a modern paperback. Rule 1 stared back at him, simple and direct:



Rule 1: The protagonist must be a writer who finds this very list.



Elias felt a chill that had nothing to do with the draft from the window. This was getting weird fast. He picked up his trusty, slightly battered laptop, the cursor blinking impatiently on a blank document titled ""Untitled Story."" With a growing sense of being a puppet on a very strange string, he typed: ""Elias Thorne, a writer whose career had stalled somewhere between 'promising' and 'utterly forgotten,' found a peculiar list tucked inside a used book...""



Rule 2: The story must begin with the protagonist discovering the list.



He paused, rereading the rule. Well, he'd already done that. He felt a small, absurd sense of accomplishment, as if he'd just cleared the first level of a bizarre video game. He read on, the paper crackling softly as he unfolded it further.



Rule 3: Every rule on the list must be mentioned within the narrative, preferably shortly after the protagonist becomes aware of it.



Alright, a bit clunky from a narrative flow perspective, but manageable. It felt less like writing and more like transcribing a set of instructions. He added a paragraph detailing his discovery of the list and explicitly mentioning Rule 1 and Rule 2, framing them as the initial, unsettling instructions Elias Thorne encountered.



Rule 4: The list must contain exactly seven rules.



He counted them again, just to be sure. One, two, three... seven. Exactly seven rules, no more, no less. He added a sentence noting this fact, feeling a strange obligation to adhere to the list's structure, even as he questioned its origin and purpose. It was as if the list itself was exerting a subtle pressure on his thoughts, guiding his fingers on the keyboard.



Rule 5: The fifth rule must be the most confusing or paradoxical.



Elias's eyes landed on Rule 5, and his breath hitched. It read: Rule 5: This rule does not apply to the story you are currently writing.



He stared at the screen, then back at the list, a disbelieving laugh bubbling up in his chest. If Rule 5 didn't apply, did he still have to mention it, as per Rule 3? If he mentioned it, wasn't he, by the very act of inclusion, applying it to the story's content? It felt like trying to grasp smoke, a concept that dissolved the moment he tried to pin it down. His fingers hovered over the keyboard, unsure how to proceed. He decided the only way to satisfy Rule 3 was to mention Rule 5, but to frame it as a source of profound confusion and logical breakdown for Elias Thorne, the character within the story.



""Rule 5, however,"" he typed, his fingers moving slowly, deliberately, ""was a knot in the fabric of reality, a self-negating command: This rule does not apply to the story you are currently writing. Elias Thorne frowned, a deep furrow forming between his brows. How could he possibly write about a rule that explicitly stated it had no bearing on the very narrative he was constructing about it? It felt like trying to divide by zero in narrative form, a logical impossibility that threatened to unravel the entire endeavor."" He leaned back, rubbing his temples, the faint scent of old paper and dust clinging to his fingertips. This list was less a guide and more a cosmic joke designed specifically for writers.



He looked at Rule 6, bracing himself for another twist.



Rule 6: The act of writing the story must cause strange, minor inconsistencies in the protagonist's reality.



As he read it, a framed poster on his wall, a print of a serene beach scene with impossibly blue water, flickered. For a second, the sand seemed to shift, the waves momentarily freezing mid-crest before the image returned to normal. Then, the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall, usually a comforting rhythm, sped up erratically for a few seconds before settling back into its usual pace. Elias jumped, his heart pounding. Minor inconsistencies? Check. This wasn't just a literary exercise; it was affecting the real world, or at least, his real world. He quickly added the flickering poster incident and the erratic clock to the story, detailing Elias Thorne's growing unease as the boundaries between his fiction and his reality began to blur. He wondered what other ""minor"" inconsistencies awaited him as he continued writing. Would his coffee turn to tea? Would his furniture rearrange itself? The thought was both terrifying and strangely exhilarating.



Finally, Rule 7. He took a deep breath, the air in his small office feeling suddenly heavy.



Rule 7: Upon completing the story according to these rules, the protagonist will find that the list has vanished, and they will have no memory of its contents, only a vague sense of unease and the completed manuscript.



This was the kicker, the ultimate paradox. He would meticulously follow the rules, pour his effort into this strange narrative, and then, upon completion, everything related to the list would be erased from his memory? It felt like a literary 'Mission: Impossible,' where the message self-destructed the moment its task was fulfilled. He wrote about Elias Thorne contemplating Rule 7, the strange, inevitable erasure that awaited him, the futility and necessity of the task intertwined. He described the character's internal debate – was the story worth writing if the very impetus for it would be forgotten?



He typed the final sentence, describing Elias Thorne saving the document, the cursor winking out of existence on the screen. He looked back at the physical list on his desk, the paper that had started this whole bizarre journey. As he watched, the elegant script faded like old ink under harsh sunlight, the lines thinning, the letters blurring, until the paper was utterly blank, indistinguishable from any other sheet. He reached for it, his fingers brushing against the smooth surface, but his hand passed through empty air. The paper was gone.



A sudden, overwhelming wave of fatigue washed over him, heavy and disorienting. He blinked, shaking his head as if to clear it. He looked at his computer screen. A document titled ""Untitled Story"" was open. He frowned; he didn't remember working on this today. He read the first line: ""Elias Thorne, a writer whose career had stalled somewhere between 'promising' and 'utterly forgotten,' found a strange sense of unease settling over him.""



He frowned deeper. Unease? Why unease? He scrolled down, reading the story as if for the first time. It seemed to be about a writer, but the details were hazy, disjointed. There was a mention of a flickering poster and an erratic clock, and something about a rule that didn't apply, but the context was missing, the connections severed. It felt like reading a story with crucial pages torn out, leaving only fragments and a lingering sense of wrongness. He had no memory of writing any of it, let alone finding a list of bizarre, self-referential rules. He saved the document again, a vague sense of accomplishment warring with profound confusion. The cursor blinked, waiting, on the next line, a silent invitation to continue a story he didn't remember starting.",1,1750379803.0,HorrorTalesCommunity,0,1.0,False

Aaron walked the length of the park, his hands shoved into his jacket pockets, soaking in the quiet hum of life around him. The trees rustled in slow, shallow breaths, their thinning branches catching fragments of a fading sunlight that felt less like warmth and more like a wound closing.



There was something almost unnatural about watching people go about their lives—the joggers pacing themselves along the worn dirt path, their footsteps a faint, almost mechanical beat; a couple sitting cross-legged on the grass, whispering, heads unnervingly close, their laughter threading softly into the breeze, a sound so fragile it might shatter. Children climbed the jungle gym, the metallic clang of swinging bars cutting through the lull of the evening with a percussive, almost violent, precision. A man stood at the pond’s edge, tossing bread to the ducks as they drifted in lazy circles, their movements too smooth, like clockwork toys.



Aaron let himself savor it—the perilous simplicity of watching, of existing without expectation, as if by remaining a mere observer, he might remain untouched. He liked this park. He liked the way nature didn’t just swallow the city noise, but seemed to digest it, leaving behind an unnatural quiet. He liked how the streetlights flickered into being like gentle, watchful sentinels as dusk crept in, their glow somehow colder than the dying sun.



That was why it unsettled him when something felt wrong. Not outright. Not in a way he could point to, no sudden tear in the fabric of the familiar. Just a shift. A low, persistent hum beneath the sounds, like a vast, unseen engine idling, waiting for something to spool up. A silence that pressed down, dense and viscous.



He found himself at the far edge of the park, near the old oak—the one with roots that swelled over the earth like petrified, grappling veins, a dark, ancient heart. Something glinted in the damp dirt beneath it, half-buried, as if disgorged from the very ground.



A USB stick.



Black plastic, unmarked, anonymous. It sat there, a tiny, alien sliver in the dimming light, somehow beckoning. For a moment, he only stared, a cold sweat breaking on his neck. Then, against every shuddering instinct, feeling a compulsive pull in his gut, he picked it up.



Aaron plugged it into his laptop that night. The silence in his apartment thickened, pressed in from the walls. At first, nothing happened, just the faint whir of the hard drive. Then the screen shuddered. It was small—barely perceptible, a twitch of pixels at the edges, like a nerve fibrillating. Then his browser opened. Then another window, slick and wet, unfolding. Then another, blooming like a parasitic growth.



His heartbeat kicked against his ribs, a frantic drum against bone. Pages loaded on their own—images sprawled across his screen like flayed realities. Fractured limbs bent the wrong way, their angles screaming; faces stretched into masks of raw, red muscle, skin peeled back like fruit rind. Text scrolled in a language that moved, warping and squirming before his eyes, a living script he could almost taste, metallic and vile.



He reached for the cursor, his hand shaking. It fought him, like a live thing snared. No matter where he dragged it, the tabs multiplied, swelling across the screen, a digital cancer spreading, consuming every available inch. Then the files appeared, hundreds of them, born from nothingness, blooming onto his desktop. One opened, its icon seeming to pulse.



A video.



A man stared back at him. His face was a map of terror, slick with sweat, eyes wide and bloodshot, breath coming in ragged, wet gasps. His skin looked loose, as if it no longer quite belonged to him. ""Don’t talk to it,"" he croaked, the sound tearing from his throat. ""Don’t listen. Delete the files. Burn the drive. Run.""



Aaron slammed the laptop shut with a sickening thud.



His lamp flickered beside him, a fit of dying light. The overhead light dimmed, sputtered, then snuffed itself out completely, leaving him in a bruised, oppressive gloom. The fridge groaned. Not like a machine – but like something vast and primordial, something alive and starving trapped behind the steel. The air was wrong. Thick with a scent like scorched plastic and coppery meat, the metallic tang of old blood.



Then the whisper slid beneath his skin, not into his ears, but directly into the bone, cold and wet. ""You won’t run. You won’t delete me. You’re already mine.""



The next day, nothing felt real. The world was a canvas painted by fever. Everything in his fridge had spoiled overnight—the milk clotted into yellow slush, thick as pus; bread bloomed with vibrant, alien mold in a way that shouldn’t be possible, a fungal garden thriving on decay. The kitchen smelled of sour rot, a stench that clung to the back of his throat. His apartment lights dimmed at irregular intervals, flickering like dying stars, their light losing the battle against an encroaching, viscous darkness.



His laptop remained open on the coffee table. Waiting. A single, dark eye. He ran his antivirus, the familiar icon a pathetic shield. It stalled halfway, the progress bar freezing, a digital heart attack. Then the text appeared, lines of contempt crawling onto his screen without input, forming words he knew weren't his: ""You think this code can save you? You cling to these pitiful defenses?""



Aaron yanked the mouse, a futile gesture. The cursor lagged, resisting, like a limb that had been dislocated. The scan froze. Then the screen breathed, a pulse of sickly light, slow and deliberate, expanding and contracting with a living rhythm. Something shifted inside the walls of his apartment, a soft squelch. The shadows stretched too long in the hallway, elongating, twisting, becoming predatory. The air tightened around him, pressing into his lungs, like a great, invisible hand squeezing his chest.



Aaron shut the laptop. And that’s when he felt it—an absence where something should have been. His reflection. The glass of the window, the dark screen of his TV, offered only the faintest distortion, a smear where his face should have been. Yet, standing there in the hallway, at the edge of the stretched shadows, was another shape. Watching. Smiling wrong. A reflection that was not his own, but a cruel, mocking mimicry.



For two days, the whispers had woven through the walls, laced through the circuits of his laptop, slipped beneath the hum of the appliances, a constant, insidious chorus. Aaron had stopped trying to shut it out. It was a pointless exercise. Because the moment he closed his laptop, the messages would bleed into his phone, into his smartwatch, into the digital alarm clock beside his bed. The screens pulsed with unreadable text—lines that moved when he tried to decipher them, squirming like maggots on the display.



Outside, the streetlights flickered in slow, rhythmic patterns, blinking in unison, like the synchronized eyes of a vast, unseen watcher. Something was speaking through them, a language of light and dark. Something was waiting, patient as a predator, its hunger growing with every passing moment.



Then the voice shifted—no longer guttural, no longer distorted. It became something colder. More precise. More alluring. ""Shall we talk?"" it purred, the words resonating deep inside his skull, a promise and a threat.



Aaron didn’t respond, couldn’t. But the laptop did. The screen shuddered, then the cursor moved on its own, dragging itself across the blank space with a terrifying purpose. A notepad window opened, stark white against the gloom. Lines began typing out—smooth, rhythmic, conversational, each word a further step into the abyss.



You understand what I am now, don’t you?



Aaron swallowed, his throat a knot of gristle and fear. He forced his fingers to move. A virus.



The reply was instant, dismissing. Not just.



What is a virus but a whisper inside a machine? A parasite of language. What is a soul but a sequence?



His throat tightened, tasting the metallic tang of fear. What do you want?



To wear you.



To live.



Aaron exhaled slowly, a long, ragged sound, forcing his fingers steady over the keyboard, clinging to the pathetic illusion of control. He didn’t know why he kept answering. Maybe because it was easier to treat it like negotiation, like logic could unravel this, like there was still a door not yet chained shut. If I say no?



The lights dimmed, a final, despairing gasp. The fridge exhaled a long, wet groan, a sound of profound suffering. Milk curdled instantly, the reek of it filling the air. You won’t. The words glowed on the screen, dripping with dark certainty. You will wonder. And once a man wonders, he is already considering.



His skin prickled, a thousand tiny teeth biting into him. If I say yes?



A pause. A silence so profound it felt like the world held its breath. The cursor blinked, once, twice. Then the reply came, deliberate, sharp, laced with an awful, seductive promise.



You will live.



For a while.



Aaron’s fingers went still, frozen above the keys. How long?



Long enough to spend.



Long enough to see.



Long enough to understand.



And when you are finished, I will carry you further.



His pulse thumped against his ribs, a frantic bird in a cage. Further where? he typed, the words a desperate plea into the void.



Beyond skin.



Beyond machine.



Beyond anything men have yet imagined.



The lights flickered in slow, patient pulses, now less like streetlights and more like the beating heart of something vast and ancient. Aaron stared at the screen, feeling—for the first time—the full, sickening weight of what was being offered. Not simply possession. Not simply destruction. Something else. Something worse. Something for which he did not have the words, no human language could contain its grotesque beauty. And yet—he almost understood. Almost.",1,1750379667.0,HorrorTalesCommunity,0,1.0,False

Now, let's apply that same level of refinement to the entire story, focusing on enhancing the psychological horror, mystery, and erotic undertones throughout. I will integrate the previous suggestions, and further refine word choice, sentence flow, and overall consistency to create a cohesive and impactful narrative.



Please give me a moment to work through the full text. This will be a comprehensive rewrite.



Here is the full story, rewritten with the specific tone and stylistic choices we discussed:



The faded pink robe, a garment of plush decay, clung to Amelia Finch like a second skin – or perhaps, a forgotten dream. Its belt, a casualty of some long-lost laundry cycle, had vanished into the ether years ago, leaving the fabric to hang open – a silent testament to its abandonment. Beneath this flimsy shroud, the delicate lacework of her panties, a sliver of dark silk against her pale flesh, offered the only true embrace. At twenty-eight, Amelia was an edifice of the average; her body neither sculpted by the gods nor blighted by disfigurement, merely… functional. Her face, a composition of soft, unremarkable features, held a certain plainness – a canvas too often left unpainted by the brush of strong emotion. Yet, amidst this landscape of the ordinary, two startling prominences asserted themselves: her breasts. Naturally ample, their perky uplift defied the gentle tyranny of gravity, crowned by areolas of a tender pink, puffed like miniature soufflés. From which, in an exquisite inversion, her nipples receded, drawing inward – secrets whispered only to the soft confines of her brassiere, or to the cool caress of the air when the robe slipped aside. Her skin, from nape to ankle, thigh to abdomen, was a landscape meticulously denuded, shorn bald – a velvet-smooth expanse maintained with an almost surgical devotion, as if preparing for an inevitable, unspoken touch.



Her apartment, number 1413, was a testament to curated detachment. Sunlight, when it deigned to visit, poured through the expansive, uncurtained windows, illuminating dust motes in a slow, almost celestial dance. No fire escape beckoned, no balcony offered a precarious perch – just glass, steel, and the sprawling, indifferent city beyond. The decor spoke of stark elegance: polished concrete floors, minimalist furniture with razor-sharp edges, a single, oversized abstract painting on the wall that seemed to hum with suppressed energy, a vibration Amelia sometimes felt in her bones. It was a stylish cage, immaculate and silent, reflecting back to Amelia a life lived in exquisite, almost painful order.



Her days unfolded with the precision of a clockwork mechanism, each hour a cog in the monotonous wheel of her solitude. Morning began not with an alarm's vulgar shriek, but with the subtle shift in the ambient light. She’d rise, the plush robe sighing around her, and move to the kitchen with the quiet grace of a specter. The ritual of coffee-making was her first prayer: the rhythmic thrum of the grinder pulverizing dark, fragrant beans; the delicate gurgle of the water as it dripped through the filter, each drop a tiny measure of time. The bitter aroma filled the air, a fleeting, potent warmth in the cool, still apartment.



Seated at her crystalline glass desk, the laptop became her portal, its screen a blinding rectangle of light against the muted tones of her living space. As a finance manager, her dominion was the monochromatic ballet of digits. Today, it was the forensic dissection of quarterly earnings – the ruthless hunt for anomalies in sprawling datasets. Her fingers, nimble and precise, danced across the keyboard, coaxing secrets from columns of figures, her brow furrowed in a concentration so absolute it bordered on trance. The low, incessant hum of the machine was the day’s constant companion, broken only by the almost inaudible sigh she might release as a particularly stubborn formula yielded to her will. Her gaze, unwavering, consumed the glowing text; the world beyond the screen – the actual, breathing city – a distant, forgotten tableau. Lunch, an act of pure sustenance, was consumed at the desk – a utilitarian salad or a pre-packaged meal, its plastic tray a sterile island in the sea of her work.



The afternoon bled into the evening with seamless, uneventful progression. Virtual meetings, disembodied voices on a flat screen, offered no true communion. Her contributions were always measured, her tone neutral, her camera steadfastly off. She preferred the disembodied anonymity – a voice without a face, a mind without a body in the echoing void of digital space. The faces of her colleagues, glimpsed briefly in the grid, seemed like inhabitants of a parallel dimension, their triumphs and anxieties mere flickering pixels. As the light outside softened, fading from the sharp clarity of day to the melancholic glow of twilight, a subtle unease would begin to stir. The silence in her apartment, once a comfort, now began to feel less like peace and more like an expansive, encroaching vacuum.



The evening's true ceremony – the ablution – began with the delicate dance of scented candlelight. The tiny flames, wavering like trapped spirits, cast dancing shadows across the pristine white tiles of her bathroom. She would fill the deep porcelain tub, the rush of water a fleeting, thunderous roar in the quiet. Steam, thick and fragrant, rose to caress her face, momentarily obscuring her reflection in the mirror, transforming the harsh lines of reality into a soft-focus dream. Sinking into the scalding embrace of the water, her body exhaled, the day's tensions dissolving into the shimmering heat.



Then, the meticulous ritual of the blade. The razor, a gleaming sliver of surgical steel, was selected with reverence. Lathering her legs, she watched the pristine white foam bloom against her skin; then, with a practiced hand, drew the scalpel-keen edge upwards. Each stroke was precise, deliberate, stripping away the invisible down, leaving behind a surface of velvet-smoothness, sensitive to the slightest breath of air. This same meticulousness extended to the most intimate geography of her body. With a quiet breath, she applied the foam to her pubis, the white cloud a stark contrast to the dark lace she had discarded. The razor followed, carving a path through the softest of hairs, leaving no trace, no shadow. It was an act of extreme privacy – a precise self-sculpting for an audience of one, a flawless, hairless expanse maintained with the precision of a votary.



Dripping and flushed, she would emerge from the bath, swathing herself in a large, thirsty towel, before returning to the familiar, comforting disarray of her open robe and the fresh lace of her panties. Dinner, a solitary affair, was consumed in the hushed elegance of her dining nook – perhaps a simple pasta, its sauce a vibrant stain on the white ceramic, or a medley of roasted vegetables. Always, a book lay open beside her plate – a portal to a life beyond her own. She devoured narratives of impossible love, cosmic horrors, or intricate mysteries, vicariously experiencing the passions and terrors denied to her own existence.



Later, the television would flicker to life, its blue light a cold, flickering companion in the deepening gloom. She scrolled through an endless parade of streaming options, never quite settling, never quite engaged. The fabricated dramas, the curated emotions, felt both too distant and too close – a mirror reflecting a life she was not living. Eventually, the quiet, persistent thrum of exhaustion would guide her to her bedroom, the city lights outside her window twinkling like a scattered handful of indifferent diamonds. Sleep was often a shallow thing, her mind occasionally looping back to the day's spreadsheets, or drifting into vague, unformed yearnings that dissipated with the first hint of morning light.



The rap on the door, sudden and insistent, tore through the uncanny quiet of the evening. It was a little past ten, the city a muted, distant hum. Amelia, half-submerged in the plush cushions of her sofa, a well-worn paperback resting open on her bared thigh, froze. Her breath caught, a small, painful gasp in her throat. No one knocked. Not truly.



Then, again, a lighter, more questioning tap. ""Amelia? It's Sarah from 14B. Are you alright? We haven't seen you around much lately"". Sarah. Always Sarah – the building's self-appointed conscience, a woman whose boundless, effervescent sociability was a constant, gentle pressure against Amelia's carefully erected walls.



Amelia’s fingers tightened on the spine of her book, the thin pages crinkling. The robe, as if sensing the intrusion, slipped further open, revealing more of the dark lace. ""Yes, Sarah, I'm perfectly fine!"" she called out, the lie thin and brittle in the sudden stillness – her voice a shade too bright, too quick. ""Just a bit under the weather. Thank you for checking, though!"" 



She stood there, rigid, listening. A soft sigh, the whisper of fabric, the faint scuff of shoes against the carpet – then silence. Sarah had receded, a tide ebbing from her shores. Amelia released the breath she’d held, a shaky exhalation that tasted of dust and unspoken dread. She remained, suspended, her hand hovering over the doorknob – a barrier unbreached. The loneliness, a cold, familiar weight, settled back into her bones – a heavy cloak in the quiet, stylish, and eternally solitary chamber of her apartment. The door, a simple slab of wood, felt as impenetrable as a vault.



Three weeks passed. Three weeks of deepening the grotesque stain emanating from apartment 1413. It commenced as a phantom whisper on the prevailing currents of the building's air conditioning, a scent so faint it was dismissed, waved away as the residue of a forgotten takeaway, a distant plumbing issue, or the spectral breath of urban grime clinging to the ventilation shafts. But as the days accumulated, stitching themselves into a ragged tapestry of time, the whisper grew into a murmur, then a low hum, and finally, a guttural, undeniable presence that seemed to cling to the very air. It was a smell that defied easy categorization, a complex blasphemy against the senses. Not merely the cloying sweetness of decay, nor the sharp tang of something putrefying, nor even the acrid bite of chemicals. It possessed a deeper resonance, a metallic undertone, like blood long dried on forgotten surgical tools, laced with the sickly, sweet perfume of lilies rotting in standing water, and something else, something profoundly animal and profound, hinting at flesh undone, at boundaries breached, at a hidden corruption blooming behind a sealed door. The residents of the fourteenth floor, accustomed to the easy currents of communal existence – the borrowed cup of sugar, the impromptu hallway chat, the shared lament about the rising cost of utilities – found their social graces curdling.



Sarah from 14B, whose initial pleasantry had been so readily rebuffed by Amelia’s disembodied voice, now found her inquiries laced with a mounting dread that tightened her throat. She would tap on the door, her knuckles brushing against the smooth, unyielding wood, and call out, her voice thin with anxiety, ""Amelia? Are you really alright? That smell… it's getting rather strong, dear. Are you sure you don't need anything? I could pick something up for you"". From within, always the same unblemished voice, calm as still water over pebbles, a voice that never seemed to crack or waver, ""I'm fine, Sarah. Just… a little indisposed. Thank you for your concern"". No click of a lock, no reassuring creak of hinges, no comforting crack in the door, no glimpse of Amelia. Just the flat, uninflected reassurance, made monstrous by the evolving stench that coiled from beneath the door, tasting of something utterly wrong.



And it wasn't just the smell. A new, unsettling malaise had begun to infest the floor, a creeping pestilence of the senses. The lights in the hallway, once a steady, reassuring glow, began to flicker erratically, sometimes dimming to a sickly orange pulse, sometimes snapping off entirely, plunging the corridor into an unnerving, transient darkness that felt more like a tangible presence than a mere absence of light. Neighbors would jump, startled, then glance nervously at 1413, as if the very darkness, the very power drain, emanated from within its sealed walls.



Then came the water. Or what appeared to be water. A strange, viscous blackness, thick as crude oil, began to pool sporadically in the indentations of the polished concrete floor. It appeared without warning, seemingly from nowhere, a glistening, opaque stain that defied logic. It had no discernible source; no burst pipes, no overflowing sinks could be traced back to its sudden appearance. It simply was. One morning, Mr. Henderson, the building manager, found a spreading slick outside apartment 1409, a few doors down from Amelia's. He knelt, his finger tentative, and touched the viscous liquid. It was cold, unnaturally so, and left a faint, disturbing oily residue on his skin that wouldn't wash off easily, clinging like a shroud. The building's maintenance staff scoured the pipes, checked every utility closet, but the source remained elusive, a dark, weeping mystery that clung to the floor like a spreading bruise on the building's very soul. The smell and the black water, the flickering lights, became an unholy trinity of dread, slowly tightening their grip on the residents of the fourteenth floor, twisting their anxieties into open fear.



In the small, awkward gatherings by the elevator, the theories began to bloom, wild and desperate. ""It's a burst pipe, I tell you,"" insisted Mr. Goldberg from 1401, trying to project an air of practicality, even as his face paled. ""Must be some kind of toxic mold growing in there. That's why she won't open the door. Afraid of the spores"". ""Mold doesn't smell like that, Arthur,"" countered Mrs. Rodriguez from 1407, clutching her purse tighter. ""That's… that's like something dead. Like a whole animal. Or worse"". Her eyes flickered towards 1413, a morbid fascination warring with outright terror. David, from 14C, Amelia’s direct neighbor across the hall, had grown noticeably gaunt, the constant presence of the stench eroding his appetite and his peace. ""What kind of person changes their locks when they're 'a little indisposed' and their apartment is leaking… that?""  He gestured vaguely at a fresh, inky stain near the communal recycling bins, its edges strangely precise, like a graphic design. Sarah, her voice tight with suppressed hysteria, wrung her hands. ""But she said she was fine! Every time! So calm. It's not right. And the lights… it's like the whole floor is cursed. My cat won't even go near her door anymore. Just hisses at it"". ""Maybe she's… gone,"" suggested a young woman from 1410, her voice barely a whisper. ""And… whatever she had in there… started to decompose"". This theory, whispered in varying degrees of horror, was the one that truly settled, a cold, heavy stone in their stomachs. But if she was gone, then who was answering? The calm, even voice from behind the door became the central, most chilling mystery. Was it a recording? A trick of the air? Or something else entirely?  The black water and the flickering lights seemed to confirm their darkest imaginings, hinting at something beyond the mundane, a slow, invisible transformation within Amelia's sealed world. The smell, now a monstrous, palpable entity, had permeated the entire building. It clung to clothes, seeped into hair, and tasted metallic on the tongue, a constant, sickening reminder that invaded their private lives. Finally, the collective unease, sharp as a sliver of glass, prompted a formal, desperate call to the building manager, a plea for intervention that carried the weight of their sanity.



Mr. Henderson, a man whose placid demeanor usually only ruffled when rent was late, arrived with his master key, a ring of glinting steel that promised access to every private world within his domain. He tapped on 1413, a brisk, confident rhythm, hoping to project an air of calm authority that he was rapidly losing. ""Ms. Finch? It's Mr. Henderson, the building manager. We've had a few… concerns, some rather unusual reports. Just a quick wellness check, if you please"". Silence, thick and expectant, descended. Then, that calm, unsettling voice, as unblemished as a fresh-dug grave. ""I assure you, Mr. Henderson, all is well. There is no need for alarm. My… indisposition is simply taking a little longer to pass"". Henderson frowned, his nostrils flaring involuntarily at the overpowering stench that now seemed to emanate directly from the door, a foul breath from beneath the crack, moist and heavy. He inserted his master key, twisting the brass with a confident snap. It turned freely, without purchase, spinning uselessly in the lock. He tried again, jiggling, rattling, forcing. Nothing. A chill, colder than any air conditioning, snaked up his spine. Amelia Finch had changed the locks. A defiant, solitary act that spoke volumes of her hermetic will, a sudden, brutal severing of her last tangible link to the outside world, a barrier raised against a world she had decided to abandon.



The police arrived swiftly, two uniformed officers, their faces initially etched with the weary patience of routine calls, an almost condescending pity for the hysterical neighbors. They knocked, harder, announcing their presence with official, unyielding authority. ""Police! Open the door, please, Ms. Finch! We have received reports of a strong odor and other… unusual occurrences"". Again, the voice, unchanged, unperturbed by the blare of their presence, an impossible calm. ""There is no need for your presence, officers. I am quite alright. Please leave me to my privacy"". A frustrated sigh escaped the lead officer, his jaw tightening. They conferred briefly, then the first officer, a burly man whose bulk seemed to absorb the hallway's oppressive atmosphere, raised a heavy boot, aiming for the plate beside the knob. The impact was a dull, shattering boom that echoed down the hallway, rattling the teeth of unseen residents behind their own doors. Yet, the door to 1413 held. Unyielding. A second kick, a third, each one a desperate, failing assault against the silence within. The wood groaned, the frame shuddered, splinters flying, but the door, a golem of wood and steel, remained an impenetrable maw. It was as though the very air behind it had solidified, bracing it against their invasion, infused with an unseen, unholy resolve.



The locksmith, summoned from his quiet domesticity, arrived, his tools clinking in a canvas bag, a mundane counterpoint to the escalating horror. He was a small, meticulous man, accustomed to defiant mechanisms, but even he seemed to shrink in the presence of the burgeoning stench, his eyes watering. He worked slowly, deliberately, the small scraping and clicking sounds of his instruments a grotesque counterpoint to the pervasive, fetid perfume emanating from the door. Minutes stretched into an eternity, each tick of his watch a measure of escalating dread. Sweat beaded on his brow, blurring his vision, the task proving far more obstinate than any he had encountered in recent memory. It was as if the very lock had a will of its own, imbued with a malignant life force, refusing to yield to the prying metal, a desperate resistance to exposure, to the intrusion of the mundane world into whatever horrific sanctity lay beyond. The air, thick with the unholy scent, seemed to grow heavier, pressing in on them. And then, with a final, protesting groan of tortured metal, a sound like a cry of surrender from something unwillingly broken, the mechanism yielded. A soft, wet click, almost audible over the oppressive silence. The door, which had seemed so impossibly bound, stood unlocked. The lead officer took a deep, fortifying breath, a grim set to his jaw, and placed his hand on the cold doorknob. He turned it, slowly, the dread in the hallway thick enough to taste, a sour, metallic tang on the tongue. The door swung inward.



The door to apartment 1413 finally yielded, a groan of tortured metal and splintered wood, swinging inward to reveal not a silent, hermetic sanctuary, but a gaping maw. Yet, before the light of the hallway could fully penetrate the abyssal gloom within, before the living could truly cross that threshold into the domain of the corrupted, the narrative of Amelia Finch demanded its final, brutal prelude.



The Final Night 



Hours before the locksmith’s tools finally cracked the defiant shell of 1413, Amelia Finch had been engaged in the quiet sacrament of her evening meal. Pasta, a simple and unchallenging dish, lay congealed on her plate, a testament to her waning appetite. Her well-worn paperback, a tale of ancient, forgotten horrors, lay open beside her, its pages soft beneath her fingertips. The plush robe, still unbelted, hung loosely, the lace of her panties a faint shadow against her skin. The only sounds were the distant, anonymous hum of the city, the soft rustle of the turning page, and the occasional clink of her fork against ceramic. Her plain face, usually a mask of mild indifference, was softened by the low glow of the reading lamp, revealing the subtle hollows beneath her cheekbones, the slight puffiness around her inverted nipples that sometimes appeared when she was relaxed. Her meticulously shaved skin, usually a smooth, cool expanse, was subtly flushed from the warmth of the meal and the quiet comfort of her solitary ritual. Then, the world outside her meticulous routine exploded.



With a sound like thunder, the door to her apartment—that very door now being forced open by the police—burst inward from its frame. Wood splintered, metal shrieked, and a gust of foul, cold air, laden with the stench of something unspeakably wrong, assaulted her. Amelia gasped, her book scattering to the polished floor, a sudden, sharp clatter against the silence. Framed against the shattered entryway stood a figure, stark and terrible: a man cloaked in absolute black, every inch of his form swallowed by dark fabric, his face obliterated by the blank, malevolent void of a black ski mask. In his hand, he held a bludgeon, a heavy, crude club, its surface rough and dark, glinting wetly in the faint light that pierced the doorway.



Terror, a cold, sharp blade, pierced through Amelia's habitual lethargy. It was a sensation so raw, so alien, that it jolted her from her quiet drone, stripping away the layers of monotonous comfort and revealing the trembling animal beneath. Her plain face contorted, a mask of pure, uncomprehending fear, her eyes wide, showing too much white. She screamed, a raw, choked sound torn from a throat unused to such utterance, a sound that grated in the sudden, abyssal silence, and scrambled from the table, overturning her chair in a desperate scramble. The crash of ceramic and wood was swallowed by the sudden, guttural roar of her attacker, a sound of pure, bestial hunger. He moved with a horrifying speed, a dark blur against the fading light of the hallway, a creature of pure, unadulterated intent, a shadow given terrible form. The first blow was aimed at her head, a whistling descent that she barely ducked, the wind of its passage tearing at her hair, a chilling caress of imminent violence. It struck the wall behind her with a sickening thud, leaving a deep gouge, a wound in the very fabric of her home, a testament to the brute force unleashed. ""No!"" she shrieked, her voice thin, useless, utterly inadequate against the encroaching darkness and the relentless, mechanical advance of her assailant.



He came at her again, relentless, a predator claiming its due. Her legs, usually so languid, pumped with a sudden, desperate energy she hadn't known she possessed, fueled by a primal need to survive. She fled, tripping over the scattered remnants of her dinner, a desperate, instinctive flight, a flight of pure, unthinking survival. The apartment, once her sanctuary, her ordered, quiet refuge, became a labyrinth of impending doom, each familiar object transformed into a treacherous obstacle. As she stumbled and scrambled, her body a frantic, uncoordinated mess of limbs, the plush robe, already loose and unbelted, snagged on the overturned chair. With a tearing sound, a fabric cry of surrender, it ripped free from her shoulder, falling away in a heap on the polished floor, a discarded skin, leaving her utterly exposed. Now, she ran in nothing but her lace panties, her body a pale, desperate flash against the deepening shadows of her home. Her natural, perky breasts, freed from the slight restraint of the robe, swung wildly with each panicked stride, two pale, bobbing targets, visibly jiggling and bouncing, pulling at the skin, against the gloom. The inverted nipples, once hidden secrets, were now exposed to the cold, predatory air, shriveling in the sudden, agonizing terror, like eyes retracting from a monstrous vision. Her meticulously shaved skin, usually so smooth and cool, was now slick with a sheen of desperate sweat, prickled with gooseflesh. She scrambled past the crystalline glass desk, her hand tearing at the sparse hair on her head, her fingers clamping, pulling, as if to rip the terror from her skull, past the inert laptop that had once anchored her days, now a silent, impotent observer of her final moments. She ran for the bathroom, the only true refuge, a small, enclosed space of porcelain and tile that promised, foolishly, escape from the nightmare that pursued her. She slammed the bathroom door shut behind her, fumbling for the lock, her fingers slick with terror, desperately trying to find purchase on the smooth metal, her nails scraping against the cold brass. The wood groaned under the impact of his body, a desperate, shuddering protest, but it held, for a blessed, agonizing moment. She turned, her bare back pressed against the cold tiles, eyes wide, breath ragged, staring at the gleaming white bathtub. It was a porcelain maw, waiting, its clean lines mocking the chaos that had erupted, a pristine basin ready to receive her broken form.



The door splintered inward, ripped from its hinges by the force of his relentless entry, wood tearing with a sound like dying breath. He filled the doorway, a monstrous shadow, his form distorted by the dark fabric, the crude club raised high, silhouetted against the dim light of the hall, a cruel parody of an executioner. Amelia screamed again, a sound that tore from her lungs, pure, unadulterated horror, a final, primal cry of defiance, a desperate animal sound. She stumbled backward, tripping over her own feet, her legs tangling, falling heavily into the tub, the cold porcelain shocking her exposed skin, a chilling premonition of her tomb. Her body slumped, a broken doll, the lace of her panties a stark contrast against the white ceramic. He was upon her instantly, a dark, heavy weight, a living shadow descending. The club descended.



The first blow struck her chest, directly between her breasts, a sickening crack that echoed in the small, enclosed space, stealing her breath. A blinding agony bloomed, fiery and absolute, radiating outwards from her sternum, a burst of searing pain that momentarily eclipsed all other sensation. She choked, a strangled cry escaping her lips, her body convulsing, her breasts, now bruised and mottled, still trembled with the force of the impact, collapsing inward. The second blow landed on her ribcage, a dull, crushing impact that drove the remaining air from her lungs, forcing a ragged wheeze from her lips. She could feel the sharp edges of bone grating, tearing, a hideous symphony of destruction beneath her own skin. A hot, wet gush erupted in her mouth, metallic and coppery. Blood. It overflowed her lips, a crimson testament to the violation, running down her chin and neck. The club rose and fell again, and again, a terrible, rhythmic punctuation to her dying gasps. Her head lolled, her vision blurring, the blank black ski mask above her swimming in a crimson haze, a swirling vortex of red and black. She felt a searing impact on her skull, then another, a deafening drumbeat of bone against blunt force, each one a final, annihilating declaration, crushing her very thoughts. Her limbs spasmed, her body becoming a broken puppet, twitching, convulsing, no longer under her command. Blood blossomed like a terrible, dark flower around her, painting the pristine white of the tub in grotesque new hues, a tableau of crimson horror. Her screams were reduced to a gurgling wheeze, then silence, a silence more profound than any she had known. The blows continued, each one a final, annihilating declaration, long after the life had drained from her eyes, leaving her a broken, pulpy mass, forever entangled with the cold, gleaming porcelain. He stood over her, a dark monument to destruction, his silhouette filling the doorway, then turned and vanished back into the night, leaving the broken door, the shattered life, and the emerging, monstrous stillness.



The Awakening 



The door swung inward with a faint, final click, revealing the interior of apartment 1413. The three men—the two officers and Mr. Henderson—were immediately assaulted by the full, unfiltered force of the smell. It was no longer a pervasive undercurrent; it was a physical blow, thick and choking, like breathing putrefied velvet. It cloyed at the back of their throats, burned their nostrils, and immediately settled in their stomachs, threatening to revolt. The air inside seemed heavier, stagnant, a tangible weight on their lungs. The apartment itself was a tableau of interrupted existence, now long past. Dust motes, thick as velvet, danced in the shafts of light that pierced the gloom, illuminated by the officers' flashlights. The minimalist elegance from Amelia’s living photographs had devolved into a grim, unholy disarray. On the glass dining table, two plates sat, one with the fossilized remains of what might have been pasta, now a dark, crusted mass, mottled with grey and green fungi. Beside it, a single, overturned chair lay sprawled, a broken sentinel guarding the decay. A well-worn paperback, its spine cracked, lay open on the polished concrete floor beside it, its pages yellowed and warped, a silent witness to a scene of forgotten terror. Every surface was filmed with a thin, almost oily layer of grime, and the silence, absolute and profound, pressed in on them, far heavier than any sound.



The officers, grim-faced, moved slowly, their flashlights cutting swathes through the oppressive atmosphere. They followed the source of the stench, which intensified with each step, growing from an overpowering reek to a nauseating, undeniable assault. The black, viscous liquid, which had puzzled the building staff in the hallway, was now plainly visible as faint, dried trails on the polished concrete, leading directly towards the bathroom. The bathroom door hung awkwardly from a single hinge, its wood splintered, a jagged, gaping wound in the otherwise pristine wall. The air in here was a noxious miasma, a concentrated distillation of the foulness from outside. The officer in the lead raised his flashlight, its beam cutting through the oppressive darkness, then he lowered it slowly, revealing the scene within. The bathtub.



Amelia Finch lay within it, a grotesque parody of repose. Her body, or what remained of it, was a shriveled, blackened husk, reduced by the merciless march of time and decomposition. The once-plush robe was indistinguishable from the matted, dark mass that had once been her hair, clinging to the skeletal remains of her head. The delicate lace panties were gone, consumed by the relentless process. Her large, perky breasts were now flat, shrunken pouches of desiccated flesh, the nipples sunken into a dark, leathery areola, almost indistinguishable from the surrounding decay. The skin, meticulously shaved in life, was now taut and stretched over the sharp angles of bone, a leathery mummy. A dark, dried pool of viscous fluid, almost black, adhered to the bottom of the tub, staining the porcelain a permanent, unholy hue. It was not merely the smell of death, but the profound silence of a body long abandoned, dissolving back into the earth from which it came. One of the officers gagged, clamping a hand over his mouth. The other, the lead, simply stared, his face ashen beneath the harsh beam of his flashlight. The scene spoke volumes of a terror unheeded, a death unmourned, and a life consumed by the very solitude it had embraced. This was not a fresh corpse; this was a relic of suffering. The police pathologist, called moments later, would confirm their silent horror: Amelia Finch had been dead for at least two months.



And then, the questions began to bloom, sharp and insidious, in the minds of the officers. How?  How had the killer entered this sealed tomb?  The front door, now hanging by a single hinge, had been secured not only by the changed mortise lock, but by a series of heavy-duty, manual deadbolts and chain locks, all engaged from the inside. The locksmith had struggled mightily, attesting to their formidable security. There was no fire escape, no precarious external staircase leading to the fourteenth floor. The apartment building stood alone, no other structure close enough for a jump or a precarious traverse. And the windows—sleek, modern, and expansive—were immovably sealed, designed for insulation and climate control, offering no egress, no crack to the outside world. The officers exchanged baffled glances, their expressions shifting from grim discovery to profound unease. The killer had vanished without a trace, leaving behind a locked, impenetrable fortress, a perfect, horrifying enigma. It was as if the apartment itself had opened its maw to devour its victim, then sealed itself shut, leaving only the stench as a mocking testament to the horror within. The ordinary laws of ingress and egress seemed to have been utterly, irrevocably violated.



With a shared, unspoken understanding of the impossible, the officers retreated from the apartment's reeking interior. They returned with tools, not for investigation, but for containment. Heavy sheets of plywood were nailed across the broken door frame, crude planks of wood sealing the secrets within. ""Forensics will handle it,"" the lead officer muttered, more to himself than anyone, his voice hollow. ""Until then, nobody goes in. Nobody comes out"". The last nail hammered home, a brutal, final clang, sealing the mysteries of 1413 behind a raw, wooden barrier.



Meanwhile, Amelia Finch sat on her plush, minimalist couch. The reading lamp cast a warm, intimate glow over her. The faded pink robe, still unbelted, hung loosely, the lace of her panties a soft murmur against her skin. On her lap, a plate of pasta, steaming gently, sat beside a well-worn paperback. She took a slow, deliberate bite, her gaze fixed on the page, the quiet hum of the city a distant, comforting drone. She was alone, in her stylish apartment, utterly absorbed in her book, the silence her only companion. The world outside, its horrors and its mysteries, was a million miles away.

i’m so sorry in advance, this is going to be long 

i have always loved my job. you know those ppl who say your life shouldn’t revolve around your job? i’m the opposite, i would literally wait for that “can you come in early?” texts. i wouldn’t make plans just in case there was a chance i could go in earlier. i’ve never dreaded going to work. i would go on my days off. i don’t even need to work, my fiancé makes enough & really wants me to stay home with our daughter. i never had any issues with anyone. i would get to work an hour earlier just to sip my drink & relax in the cafe, i recently got partner of the quarter - point is i love my job. but i don’t know what’s going on, i don’t know if im just a closer at heart (i switched to mornings) IDK call me dramatic but to me it’s the most gut wrenching thing ever that i started to hate my job. i cry while getting ready. cry on my way there. cry on my breaks. get teary eyed on the floor. i try to find every excuse in the book to call out when before i had switched to mornings, i had 100% perfect attendance (i’ve been a partner since 2022, that’s almost 3 years of perfect attendance) i feel bad because sometimes i catch myself not giving my 100% & i know it affects my coworkers as well (for example them waiting on a drink that would’ve been done faster if i had acted quicker) & when i catch myself like that i immediately step up my game because nobody likes that coworker. nobody likes the coworker with 0 urgency, at least i hated being scheduled with that type of person. i’ve been soo so sad it’s even affecting my life after work. i feel embarrassed to say depressed but this switch up in my emotions towards my job has truly taken a toll on my mental health & things that were easier before feel 100x harder. 

it’s gotten to the point where i just want to quit but the only reason i haven’t is because i know that love for my job is still there. it’s hiding extremely well but i know it’s there & i don’t want to let go of starbucks so if you’ve ever felt discouraged, what did you do or how did you overcome this feeling? i reached out to my manager & asked him about becoming coffee master in hopes that maybe working towards something within the company will get rid of this feeling (no my manager doesn’t know how i’ve been feeling) 

starbucks was my escape from my abusive home during my teenage years. i would sit in the lobby for HOURS either doing homework (i was in middle school & high school) or if i didn’t have homework i was writing or watching netflix on my computer. the baristas would notice i would be there until 11am-11pm & would always give me something to eat. the “second home” was never just a slogan to me i don’t know what i would’ve done if i didn’t have that escape. i feel such a deep connection with starbucks & that’s why i say i know the love for my job is hiding somewhere, i just dont know what to do to find it again. i really dont want to quit. i want to but i really don’t. if you’ve read this far, thank you. you have no idea how much this means to me. i know it was a lot & any advice would truly help

I know it’s strange.. but she was my best friend and a soul mate. I’ve left one since 2022 for her and submitted her name for one.. it breaks my heart that I can’t make it this year and look for it

Last year hers was in that main covered area with the shrines.  It may have a drawing off Winnie the Pooh on it if that helps.

Anyways.. 

If someone could do that for me you’d fill my broken heart with so much joy right now. And I’d kick you some cash or something for coffee or something if need be.

I’ve been trying to find this book for years and Google has never helped, so I’m hoping someone here knows it.

I read it in grade 5 or 6 (around 2010s), but it felt like a high school–level YA thriller. It was a super easy read, but the plot was wild. Here’s everything I remember:
	•	The main character is a teenage girl.
	•	Her mom works at a mental hospital, and one of her male patients becomes obsessed with her daughter (the main girl).
	•	He sees a photo of the girl, and that’s what sparks his obsession.
	•	He comes up with a plan to get close to her: he kills the mom in a hit-and-run (at the beginning of the book) so the dad and daughters move out to a smaller town, which he lives in. this is how he gets close to her. 
	•	In this new town (it had small-town or acreage/farm vibes), the girl meets a boy and falls in love with him—but it’s the same guy. She doesn’t realize it for most of the story. i remember there was chapter w them at a coffee shop. 
	•	She has visions or feelings about her mom’s death i think. 
	•	Her sister starts getting suspicious of the boy and he drugs her or tries to kill her to silence her.
	•	Toward the end, the girl and the boy are at a party near a forest. She sees something like an insurance paper or car repair receipt and realizes he was the one who killed her mom.
	•	She tries to escape through the woods and ends up at a cliff with a deep river below. She hears her mom’s voice tell her to jump, so she does.
	•	The guy jumps after her.
	•	Everyone from the party sees this happening and the police arrive.
	•	The book ends with the guy getting arrested or taken away in a cop car.
	•	I clearly remember him yelling things like:
“I did this for you! I did this so we could be closer!”

Please tell me someone else read this! I’ve been searching for years and would love to finally know the name. Thank you!!

1lfqc1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lfqc1f/free_regular_fries/,Free Regular Fries...,"Free regular fries... 

That was what brought me into Captain Cluckey's that day. I stood there in line behind two middle aged women who were taking a rather long time to place their order. Where is my mind by the Pixies played over the restaurant speakers. Over the music I could hear the man in the dirty ragged clothes out front, still yelling about the end of days. I did my best to ignore him, just like everyone else. I turned back to look out the window, past the ragged man and across the street to the bus station. I thought about how I should have been out of this backwoods town and on my way back to Chicago by now. Unfortunately, my car had broken down a mile outside of the town of Pleasence. The town mechanic said he could have the part in sometime next week, but I had no intention of hanging around that long. Double unfortunately, the bus to the city didn't run until the next morning. So, for the time being, I was marooned here. 

 I glanced down at the receipt in my hand, the attached coupon read, Free regular fries with next purchase. I had gotten a Clucky combo meal earlier that day and with nothing else to do, I decided to grab my extra fries and loiter around town till morning. I was low on cash, so a room at the local motel wasn't in the cards. 

I checked my watch, 7:35PM. “Only about 13 hours to go.” I thought to myself. I glanced up to the ladies ahead of me, still talking over their order. The door chimed behind me and a group of teenagers came in, laughing and talking loudly. I gave them a cursory glance and noticed one of them wore clothes that weren't quite in the style of the others, an old letterman jacket and jeans instead of the tee shirts and shorts the others wore. I noticed the bruising on his throat and made a note to myself to not make eye contact with that particular young man. I was sandwiched between the two chatty Kathys and the obnoxious teenagers and my social anxiety was climbing to a fever pitch. Not only that, but the nicotine itch was beginning to set in. I shrugged to myself and stepped out of line; I was in no hurry after all.  

Stepping out into the warm summer evening, I looked up orange and purple sky. The sky seemed so clear out here away from the city. I pulled my crumpled pack of cigarettes out of the pocket of my thrift store Hawaiian shirt as the ragged man continued his tirade a few feet away from me. I lit my cigarette and continued to ignore him. After a moment he noticed me and stepped over, directly in front of me.  

“THEY ARE HERE! YOU ALL MUST LEAVE THIS PLACE! DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY ARE BENEATH US! THEY ARE AMONG US! AND THEY WILL COME FOR YOU ALL! YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE TRUTH; YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT COMES AFTER BUT YOU ARE ALL WRONG! ALL OF YOU! THEY WILL DEVOUR YOU! THEY WILL HOLLOW YOU OUT AND FILL YOU WITH HATRED AND ROT! ROT! ROT! 

I inhaled the smoke and focused on the setting sun, doing my best to ignore the man's putrid breath as he screamed in my face. I exhaled and watched the smoke drift through the man's face before calmly moving to lean against the restaurant wall. I didn't react to the man, didn't acknowledge him. I couldn't, if I did, he would never leave me alone. Eventually he went back to his place on the sidewalk and started his speech all over again. I glanced over at him, standing there shouting, begging to be heard, preaching his heart out to an absent congregation. I pitied him, what he was. I wondered at the circumstances that brought him to that place.  

After smoking another cigarette and doom scrolling on my phone for a few minutes, I went back inside and found that the line had dissipated. The cashier from earlier was gone, replaced by a pimple faced kid with a name tag that read, Jimmy. His head hung low as I approached the counter. Probably looking at his phone, I thought. 

“Welcome to Captain Cluckey's, how may I help you?”  

His voice carried such melancholy that I assumed those other teens had been giving the poor kid a hard time.  

“I'll take a small soda and a free regular fries.” I said laying the coupon on the counter.  

The kid looked up at me slowly, his eyes finding mine and studying me for a moment. Suddenly his mouth dropped open in a dopey smile and he turned and headed back into the kitchen muttering something about being right back. I stood there, confused. “The hell was that about?” I wondered.  

After a few minutes, the cashier from earlier came out from the kitchen and saw me. 

“Sorry about the wait sir, what can I get you?” He said stepping up to the counter. 

I squinted and looked back to the kitchen, “What happened to the other guy?”  

“Other guy?” He asked. “What other guy?” 

Then it hit me. “Shit.” I muttered under my breath. 

I glanced around the restaurant. The chatty Kathys were nearby, watching me curiously. From their point of view, I had just placed my order to thin air. So, I looked like a crazy person. That was fine, maybe I was. Who the fuck cares? 

I looked back to the group of teens, they were still in their own world, still being obnoxious. But the out of place one, he was watching me now. I did my best not to meet his eyes, but I knew he could see me. He knew I could see him. I fucked up. 

“Looks like it's time to go.” I thought. I turned to head for the door and saw the ragged man standing outside. I needed to compose myself before leaving, I was rattled. I needed to clear my head; be alone for a moment. In the bathroom I splashed water on my face and studied myself in the mirror. I looked older than my 25 years. My shaggy sandy blonde hair was now streaked with silver, and the lines on my face were more care worn than they once were. 

“Hi there!” Came the voice from behind me.  

Jimmy, the other cashier, was there. I tried to act like I didn't hear him, looked through him when I turned around, tried all the usual tricks. But when I went to open the door, Jimmy stepped in my way, and I hesitated. 

“I know you can see me.” He said, his eyes burrowing into mine.  

Yeah, the jig was up. I do my best to avoid these situations, otherwise they never leave me alone, always seems to be just a little more unfinished business. I sighed, “What do you want?” 

He laughed, “How?” He asked. “How can you see me? Can you see others?” 

I shook my head, “Doesn't matter. I can see you, I can hear you. Tell me what you want or leave me alone.”  

“Okay, Okay.” He said. “I'm sorry, I just... I haven't spoken to anyone in... Well, I'm not sure how long. Your car broke down right? It's a small town, people gossip, and all I can do is listen. Well, until now.” He smiled wide. 

I nodded and made a get on with it motion.  

“Well, there are others here. They want what I want, maybe you can talk to them too? I’ll go...” 

“No!” I demanded, grabbing his arm before he could leave. “No others, that's the deal. You already know, I can't change that. I help you and you never mention this to anyone else. Got it?” 

He stared down at my hand on his arm, “Holy crap, you can actually touch me.” His eyes shot up to mine.  

“Thats the deal, got it?”  

He nodded, “Okay, I mean, yeah deal.”  

I let go of his arm; icy pain was radiating up my arm from my hand. I’ll never get used to how it feels to touch the dead, they have substance but at the same time they don't. Like trying to hold on to frozen mist. 

“So, what do you want?” I asked again. 

He smiled, “Well, my name is Jimmy.” He said pointing at his nametag. “And I was murdered.” He turned to show me a series of stab wounds on his back.  

I nodded, “And you want me to find the killer, right?”  

“Oh, no.” He said, still smiling, “I know who it was. He got away with it, but he died a few months ago. Heart attack, and he saw me as he passed. It was very cathartic.”  

“Okay. So, what do you want?” I asked. 

“Weeell. Here’s the thing, and you might want to brace yourself because this is a big ask... What was your name by the way?” 

“My name is Jonas.” I said. “Now please for the love of God, tell me what you want.” 

“Oh, like the Weezer song, neat. Okay, well here goes. So, the man that killed me, also killed several other people around town, mostly just drifters and the like, no one who would be missed. Only he wasn't the only one. He was actually a member of some kind of cult based here in Pleasence. I'm not sure what their practices or goals are, aside from killing lots of folks. But I do know that whatever they are planning, it will be coming to a head soon. I've heard lots of hushed talk about the new moon and rituals and a lot of other such stuff. I think they want to open some kind of doorway to somewhere, but I really can't be sure. You really never can tell with these culty types. So, my request is that you, Jonas, seek out the members of this cult and put a stop to whatever they're cooking up.”  

I took a breath and blew out my cheeks. “So, there's a cult?” 

“Yes.” 

“And they are doing something big on the new moon?” 

He nodded, “Correct.”  

“Which is tonight.” 

His smile faltered a little but didn't go away altogether, “Um, I guess so.” 

I leaned back against the sink and crossed my arms, ""So, you want me; one mentally unstable guy, to find and stop a whole ass cult from opening up some kind of doorway or something? And you want me to do it tonight? Like right now? Does that about sum it up?” 

His smile had completely melted away as I laid it all out. He said, “I mean, it sounds like a lot when you say it like that.” 

“Goodbye Jimmy.” I said as I brushed past him and out the door. 

Of course, he followed me, “Hey wait!” He yelled across the restaurant as I made my way to the exit. 

“Don't follow me.” I said over my shoulder. 

“Are you alright sir?” The cashier asked as I passed the counter.  

I ignored him and pushed through the door, also ignoring the still ranting ragged man on the sidewalk. If the kid was right and there really was some kind of cult here, doing something tonight. I wanted to get as far away from here as possible. I was halfway down the block when I heard the dead cashier calling out to me again. 

“I know it's a lot, but what are the odds of you, of all people, showing up here right at this time. Thats either one heck of a coincidence or you are meant to be here. I believe you are here for a reason Jonas.” 

I pulled out my phone and held it to my ear. If anyone happened to be watching, I was just taking a phone call, “I'm here because my car broke down, there is no other reason. Besides even if I wanted to help, it isn't possible. I don't know the first thing about dealing with cults or whatever. Now stop following me.” 

“It is possible if we work together, if we have faith...” 

“Faith?” I laughed, “Faith in what? In people? The universe? “God?” 

“How can you not have faith? With your gift...”  

“Gift? My Gift?” I said, cutting him off. “You wanna talk about gifts, about beliefs?” I shook my head, “Let me tell you a story. See, the original owner of the house I grew up in fell asleep with a lit cigarette in his hand. The house was almost a total loss, but my folks happened to come along and got the place for a steal. Would you like to take a guess which room he died in?” I asked. “Every night he stood the foot of my bed, tears running down burnt and blackened cheeks, going on and on about how he was a good Christian. How he shouldn't still be here. And when he found out I could see him...” 

“What happened?”  

“He screamed, raged, begged me to help him, demanded I help him.” 

“And did you?” 

“I was 9 years old. What the fuck could I have done?” 

Jimmy said nothing so I continued, “It wasn't long after that, he realized he could make physical contact with me.” 

Jimmy winced. 

“Yeah, now he had someone to take out all his anger and frustration on.” 

“Didn't you tell your parents?” He asked. 

“Of course I did, and they sent me to therapy. And therapy led to doctors, which led to medication, then to psyche wards. No one believed me. Do you have any idea how many people die in those places? Do you think they move on when they do?” I shook my head, “I just thought the burned man was bad. Is that your idea of a gift?” 

He began to speak, then trailed off. 

“Yeah, I wouldn't know what to say either. You wanna know what I believe kid? I believe that God, if he's even still around, either hates us or doesn't give a shit about us anymore.” 

‘Thats not true.” He said. 

I chuckled, “Look at yourself kid, if you’re such a faithful believer, then why are you still here?” 

“I don't know!” he shouted, “But there has to be a reason, I have to believe I'm here for something.” 

I shrugged at him and turned to leave. “Sorry, kid. I'm all out of Faith.” 

“Please, Jonas.” He continued. “Fine, don't do it for me, or faith or God or any of that. Do it for the innocents that haven't died yet.  Please help me stop them from killing anyone else.” 

I stopped. I didn't want to deal with this, didn't want to know about some cult in the middle of nowhere. But now I did, and if he was right, people could die tonight, innocent people. How would I feel if I could have stopped it and didn't? What would that kind of decision do to whatever is left of my own soul. Shouldn't I at least look into it and see if anything can be done. I sighed, “God dammit.”  

Jimmy smiled when I turned around. 

“Where and when is this ritual happening?” I asked. 

“So, you'll help?” 

“I don't know. I don't know if there's anything I can do. But I have nothing else to do and nowhere to go so I might as well check it out. So, where's it happening?” 

He shrugged, “I don't know for sure where, but it has to be happening soon right?” 

I looked as the last rays of sunlight sank below the horizon, “Yeah, I'd say so. Okay, do you know of any other members of the cult? Where do they live?” 

Jimmy thought for a moment. “I know that Mr. Paterson, the school science teacher, and Greasy Bob, the guy who runs the gas station, are both members. I've heard them discussing some horrible things inside Cluckey's. But I've never been to where they live, you'd have to go without me.” 

“Shit.” Funny thing about ghosts, if they had never been there when they were alive, they can't go there when they're dead. “No, if I'm doing this, I'll need someone watching my back.” 

Just then flashing red and blue lights pulled up next to me and stopped. Jimmy stood there, his legs vanishing into the hood of the town sheriff's car. 

“Evening son.” He said it friendly enough, though he eyed me suspiciously.  

“Evening.” I nodded back in greeting. “What can I do for you officer.” 

He pushed an oversized cowboy hat up on his head, “Well we got a call about somebody out here by the Cluckey's having conversations with himself. Would you happen to know anything about that?” 

I smiled, “Oh yeah, sorry about that. I must look like a crazy person. I was talking on the phone; I have a Bluetooth earpiece.” I said pointing at my ear, which was fortunately covered by my long hair. 

The sheriff nodded, “Oh I see. Well, I suppose that makes a little more sense. Although, you're not from around here, are you? What brings you to town?” 

“No sir, my car broke down and is in the shop here. Should be fixed sometime next week but I'm leaving on the bus in the morning.” 

“Okay, so where are you staying tonight?” He asked. 

I shrugged, “Honestly, I haven't quite figured that out yet.” 

He studied me for a moment, “Well we have a fine motel in town, and if needs be we have a cell or two empty at the station. Come on by, if you can't find somewhere. It aint the Ritz but you won't be on the street.” 

I smiled and nodded, “Thank you sir, I might just do that.” 

He nodded back, “Tell them Sheriff Reed sent you.” And with that, he drove off, leaving me alone again, sort of alone. 

“I got it.” Said Jimmy. “Old Mrs. Thompson. She runs the pharmacy, and she used to give me piano lessons when I was a kid.” 

“And she's part of the cult?” I asked dubiously. 

“I mean, I don't know for sure. But she was always such a hateful woman, and I did see her talking with the science teacher and greasy Bob a few times.” He shrugged, “Although everyone around here talks to everyone at some point, could be just coincidence.” 

“Do we have any other options?” I asked 

He shrugged again, “Not really.” 

“Okay then.” I said, “Let's go see old Mrs. Thompson, the evil pharmacist.” 

 

Ten minutes later, we were standing in front of a large old farmhouse with a long winding fence lined driveway, complete with a dilapidated red barn and grain silo. 

“This is the place.” Said Jimmy. “So, what's the plan?” 

“Does this place look too picture perfect to you?” I asked. 

“What do you mean?”  

I shook my head, “Never mind. So, what happened to Mr. Evil pharmacist?” 

“Oh, he passed years ago. Poor man had a stroke while tending the field.” 

“A stroke huh?” I asked. Turning to look at him halfway up the long dirt drive. 

“Yeah, bless his heart.” 

“I'm guessing you haven't been back here since you died?” 

“No, why?”  

I stopped and pointed towards the barn, “Because he's still hanging from the tree next to the barn.” 

He looked to where I was pointing to see the late Mr. Thompson. He was in fact still there; his hands bound with the same blue nylon rope as was around his neck. His eyes bulged as they followed us up the drive.  

Jimmy’s mouth dropped open in shock, “Well that dirty rotten liar. Why would he go and do a thing like that?” 

“Look again kid, most people don't bother tying their hands to kill themselves.” 

He gasped, “That means...”  

I nodded. 

Jimmy shook his head, “Poor Edgar. Well, that seals it, she has to be one of them.” 

“I think you're right.” I said pointing to the house.  

The old woman stepped out of the front door and walked over to an old pickup; she was wearing some kind of dark cloak or robe. She started the truck, and the headlights illuminated the drive. 

“Get down.” I said as I ducked behind a bush next to the fence line, then realized who I was talking to and mentally kicked myself. I took the kick back when Jimmy did in fact get down behind the bush next to me. 

The truck passed, probably going to wherever the ritual would be taking place. I briefly considered diving into the truck bed as it passed but quickly dismissed the idea. It was moving too fast, and I didn't think I was stealthy enough to get in without making a sound. 

When we were sure the truck was gone, we made our way to the farmhouse. I was hoping I could find some clue as to where the ritual would be.  

Jimmy stepped through the front door and waved to me through the glass; I grinned and flipped him off.  

“Can you see anything?” I asked. 

“I don't know what to look for.” He said waving his arms.  

I sighed, “Are there any schedules or notes stuck to the fridge that say big secret cult thing at this time. Anything like that?” 

“No, nothing here in the front room, which is the only room I have ever been in. Well, and the bathroom one time but I don't think we will find anything in there.” 

“Damn. Okay, I’ll find a way in.” 

I was hoping this was one of those country towns you hear about, where everyone is so friendly they don't even bother locking their doors. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with a locked and deadbolted front and back door. But not totally disappointed, I found one of the side windows had been left cracked open.  

I slid open the window and looked in, it was the kitchen. I climbed inside, careful not to knock over any of the dozens of dishes stacked precariously by the sink. I looked around the kitchen and dining room. Apparently there had been some big feast here, and all of the food was just left out. 

“What the hell?” 

“What is it?” Jimmy called from the front room. 

“Is Mrs. Thompson a bit of a slob?” 

“What? No not at all, she's always been very tidy.” 

 “It looks like she had company, like a lot of company. A big dinner or something but they didn't clean any of it up. All the food and dishes are just left out.” 

“Why would they do that?”  

“I'm not sure, unless they thought there was no need to clean up.” 

“Like they weren't coming back.” Jimmy continued. 

I left the disaster of a kitchen and made my way into the front room. Jimmy was staring out the window at Mr. Thompson, dangling from the tree. 

“Isn't there something you can do for him?” he asked. 

I shrugged, “I don't know, he most likely can't speak, and even if he could, he seems to be bound there.”  

I started searching through the papers on Mrs. Thompsons desk. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Jimmys head sink low. I cleared my throat, “I'm hoping, that stopping whatever his wife is doing will be enough to set him free.” He nodded slightly, and I went back to my search. 

“Anything yet?” Jimmy asked as I came back from searching the bedroom. 

“No.” I grumbled as I plopped down on the couch and pulled out my cigarettes. 

“Oh Mrs. Thompson hates smoking, you shouldn't...” He started then stopped when he saw the look I gave him. He nodded and smiled awkwardly, “Right, evil cult lady. Wish I could have one, really stick it to her.” 

I lit my cigarette and chuckled. “How did you die anyway?” I asked. 

He looked down at his feet for a moment then took a calming breath, “Well, it was a typical Tuesday night for the most part, only we weren't as busy as we usually were. My boss, Dave, told me I could take the night off early. He said he was gonna close soon anyway, had some work to do at the church or something. I thanked him and headed out the door. I had been home for about an hour when I realized that I forgot to clock out. I was tempted to just say “Oh well” and fix my timecard on my next shift... But I always had to be a goody two shoes, that's what my brother used to say anyway.” He took another deep steadying breath before continuing.  “When I walked back into the office to clock out, I noticed the back door was open. I could hear voices but couldn't make them out. So, I got closer and peered out through the open door. Dave was there, but he wasn't alone. Greasy Bob was there, and another man that I didn't know, He was an older man, with white curly hair and dirty clothes. They had him hogtied in the bed on Bobs truck. He looked up at me and moaned something through the duct tape covering his mouth. I don't know what it was, but his eyes pleaded for me to do something. Dave had been telling greasy Bob something about where to take the man, but he stopped at the man's moans for help. They turned around and saw me and I ran, I tried to anyway, but I wasn't quick enough.” He sighed, long and sad, “And that was the end of me.”  

I breathed out a lung full of smoke, “Fuck... I'm sorry.” 

He nodded and continued, “Afterward, when I figured out I was dead, I learned about the cult. Like I said, Mr. Paterson and greasy Bob would come into Cluckey’s and discuss things. And there were always rumors around town about...” He trailed off. 

I looked up at him, “What?”  

“The rumors, I never thought about it until now but...” 

“What rumors Jimmy?” I demanded. 

He was pacing the floor, “The old chapel on the edge of town. When I was a kid the older teens at school always used to tell us stories about it being haunted, but I never really believed any of it.” 

I gave him a look that said, “Really?” 

He shrugged, “Well, that was before. And I still don't think its haunted, I mean maybe it is but that's not all. They used to tell stories about seeing dark hooded figures coming and going from the chapel on certain nights. Holy crap, Jonas. I think that's the ritual site.” 

He smiled and put up his hand for a high five, “come on Jonas, let’s go stop a cult!” 

I grinned and got up, putting my cigarette out on the couch and slapping his hand, “Lets fucking go.” 

We left the Thompson house and headed for the old chapel. I checked my watch, 9:40PM. “Still a couple hours till midnight.” I thought to myself. I had no idea if midnight mattered but it seemed like the time to do culty ritual shit to me. 

 

It took about 25 minutes to walk across town to the old chapel, even at a brisk pace. We were about 100 yards away from the chapel when Jimmy came to a dead stop. 

“What are you doing?” I asked turning back to face him.  

“I can't go any farther.” he said demonstrating by walking forward and not actually moving. “Other kids would go to the chapel on dares, but this is as far as I ever made it.” 

“God dammit.” I muttered, “Okay. Well, I guess I’ll go see what I can do. You stay here and keep a watch out.” 

“For what?” He asked. 

“I don't know, just yell if you see anything.”  

“What are you going to do?”  

I shrugged, “I’ll figure something out.”  

I crouched down in the tall grass by the road and crept up to the big creepy old building. “What the fuck am I doing?” I kept asking myself. 

The old chapel was, old to say the least. It had once been painted white but was now almost all bare wood, only a few chips of paint still clung to the weathered boards here and there. The windows looked like they had all been broken and boarded up, and a faint orange light poured out from between the boards. The steeple stood tall but warped at an odd angle, and the large cross that stood up on it was partially broken off, making it resemble a capital T. 

I could hear hushed voices inside, chanting low and ominously. I crept up to a window and tried to see inside but my view was blocked by old pews shoved against the sides. Through the boards, I could see the ceiling of the chapel, there was a large hole in the roof. If I could get up there, I could get a better view of what was happening.  

I crept my way around to the back of the building and found the old Mrs. Thompson's pickup. Luckily it had been parked right up next to the building. I climbed on top of the truck's cab as quietly as I could, then scrambled my way onto the roof, a little less quietly. The roof boards creaked under my weight, and I held my breath, hoping no one had noticed. When there was no sign of anyone coming to see what the noise was, I made my way further up the roof, crawling on my belly. 

When I reached the edge of the hole, I peered down to see a dozen people. Most of them were dressed in dark robes with hoods up. They walked in a circle around a large pentagram drawn on the floor. Another man stood at the alter holding a large leatherbound book. He wore a white robe and hood. I leaned out to see better and the boards began to creak more. Suddenly they gave way, and I fell down into the midst of them in a heap of rubble, luckily some poor bastard broke my fall.  

The assembled cultists jumped back at my sudden arrival, then one by one, they all gathered round to look down at me. 

“So, I guess this isn't AA?” I said between coughs. 

“You!” Said the man in white, who I guessed was the leader.  

He removed his hood and glared at me; it was Sheriff Reed.  

“Evening again, officer. I think I'll take that cell now.” I said as I climbed to my feet. 

“The son of a bitch killed Bob.” Said one of the cultists behind me. 

“What the hell are you doing here?”  

“I was gonna ask you the same thing?” I said, “But I think I already know.” 

He squinted at me, “Whatever you think you know, you're wrong.” 

“So, you're not trying to open a doorway to hell and let out a whole bunch of nasty shit? Pretty much fucking up the whole world.” 

The cultists around me started muttering to each other. 

“We are doing the world a favor. I know you can't see that, but you will.” He said as a smile spread on his face. “You will soon see firsthand. Since you robbed us of one of our number, your blood will have to do.”  

I looked back to see the cultist I had landed on; his neck twisted at an unforgiving angle. “Oops.”  

“Hold him.” Said the sheriff. 

I looked around and recognized one of the hooded figures approaching me. 

“Hey Mrs. Thompson. Edgar says hello, or at least he would if the rope hadn't crushed his throat.” 

She stumbled back in surprise, “What? How...”  

But I didn't wait for her to finish. My foot shot out, connecting with the nutsack of the man in front of me. He crumpled to the ground as I pivoted and threw a punch at the next cultist, their nose crunched audibly and blood splattered Mrs. Thompson. Unfortunately, that was about all the damage I managed to do. I tried to fight but there were too many. suddenly, something hard impacted the back of my head and the last thought that ran through my head as my vision went dark was, “Well, shit. This is how I die.”  

 

I came to some time later. My hands cuffed around a pillar at the back of the chapel. The cultists were chanting something in some language I couldn't understand, maybe Latin? I wasn't sure. I could feel blood, sticky on the side of my face. I tried to move but the cuffs would let me get far. 

“You’re awake.” said the sheriff. “Just in time.” 

I stood, as well as I could, “In time for what? To watch you fuck up the whole world?” 

“To watch us save it. And you, whoever you are, get to be a part of it. Though you don't deserve it.” 

The sheriff went back to his place behind the alter and raised his hands addressing the assembly. “My friends. Tonight is the long-awaited night. You have all worked so hard to get us to this point and I am so very grateful to you all.”  

The cultists gave polite cheers and applauded. 

“This world is sick my friends, and it will only get sicker. We must stop it. We must bring about the great cleanse.” 

They applauded louder. 

“Just as God cleansed the earth with the great flood, we must now bring upon it the power of the cleansing flame! Only then will the world know true peace and righteousness again!” 

The cultists shouted with joy. 

“The hour approaches, bring out the sacrifice!” 

The cultist came and uncuffed me from the pillar, I tried to get away but it was no use. They drug me to the center of the pentagram. Sheriff Reed approached me, the book and a knife in his hands. 

“You must have really bad luck son. You see, Bob there had volunteered to be the sacrifice. But since you decided to drop in and break his damn neck, looks like you’re it.” 

I squirmed in the cultists grip, “How do you even know this will work? Don't I have to be willing or something?” 

Someone punched me in the gut, causing me to gasp for air. As he approached, he pricked his finger with the knife. My shirt was ripped open and began drawing something on my chest. 

“Doesn't say anything about willing, only that the sacrifice be marked with the sigil. Which now, you are.” 

The sheriff opened the book and began reading a passage. The language he spoke, it made no sense, it hurt my head to hear. My vision blurred and cleared then blurred again. I thought I would pass out, then I saw it. Through the hole in the ceiling of the chapel, stood a huge, emaciated figure. Towering high and blocking out the night sky, its flesh the color of ash. Two massive wings spread out, flexing and stretching, eager to take flight. There were charred and broken skeletons dangling from the thing's coal black antlers. Its face was like that of a jackal and its eyes were deep set and burning with a fire so hot I could feel the heat from them. As it looked down at me, I saw visions of scorched cities and towns, the oceans boiled and the whole world burned. I knew that there would be no peace on earth, there would be nothing left but ash and ruin if this thing got out. I could not let that happen. 

I looked back at Sheriff Reed just in time to see him plunging the knife straight at my heart. I had no other choice. I did something I absolutely hated. Something I had only done once before. I clenched every muscle in my body, and I shifted myself out of the living plane. Every cell in my body screamed out in agonizing pain. It felt like dying, which I guess it kind of was. I could only hold it for a few seconds, but it was enough. The knife passed through me and into the chest of the cultist behind me. I shifted back and fell to the floor, looking back at the cultist with the blade buried in his chest.  

Everyone gasped, the sheriff started to say something but was cut off by the cultists blood curdling scream. His body began to stretch and expand as skin ripped, and bones snapped. Suddenly his eyes caught fire, and his body exploded. Showering everyone with chunks of gore. Just as quickly, the cultist who had been next to him began screaming as his eyes caught fire. I jumped to me feet and ran for the door. I heard the wet pop as the next one exploded and the screaming continued. I shoved through the door and slammed it closed behind me. Maybe I'm an asshole for barring the door shut with them inside. But I did it anyway.  

One by one the screaming stopped, accompanied by the sound of 9 more people exploding from the inside out. Then came a great deep howling roar that seemed to shake the earth, car alarms went off, dogs and coyotes howled in the distance. The tone was so low, I felt like my eardrums would burst. There was the sound of strong winds like a hurricane, heat radiated from the edges of the chapel door. Then all at once the roaring and wind sound faded away into nothing. 

 After a few minutes, when I was pretty sure it was all over, I opened the door and stepped inside. The blood and gore that had to have covered the place was burnt to ash, but the robes lay there still, empty and smoldering but whole. I walked across the floor to what stood at the center of the ash covered room. The book, it completely unharmed. I bent down to pick it up and read the inscription on the cover, Liber Vitae, Mortis et Ultra. “Whatever that means.” I thought. No clue how those yokels got ahold of something like this, but I figured I had better hang on to it. Wouldn't want it to fall into the wrong hands, again. 

Jimmy was standing there waiting for me as I approached, “Jonas! Are you alright? What happened? And what was that thing standing over the chapel? “And why are you covered in blood? Eww” 

I laughed and patted him on the shoulder, “Let's get out of here, I'll tell you on the way.” 

On the way back into town we stopped by a pond where I rinsed the blood off of my shirt and out of my hair, didn't need anyone asking complicated questions. Jimmy was doing enough of that already. I told him what had happened and how I stopped the cult through sheer stupid luck.  

“You mean you went ghost mode?” he asked, grinning like a kid. 

I shook my head, “First off, that's fucking stupid and I'm not calling it that. Second, I really don't know what it is or how I do it. It just seems to be something I can do, though it hurts like hell and I never want to do it again.” 

A firetruck passed as we walked back up the street towards the bus stop, it looked like it was headed for Mrs. Thompsons place.  

We sat together on a bench next to the bus station and talked for a while. Jimmy told me stories about his life growing up in the small town, we laughed and joked together. I wondered to myself what was still keeping him here, I had assumed that once this was over, he could move on.   

It turned out I had been unconscious for longer than I first thought. My watch and phone had broken at some point, so I had no clue what time it actually was. As we sat there talking like two old friends, I could see the first rays of the sun peaking over the treetops. 

Jimmy stopped halfway through a story; his eyes focused on a man a few blocks away. The man was maybe in his mid 50s, with thinning gray hair and a thick mustache. The man stopped to unlock the front door of a hardware store. I looked back to Jimmy and saw tears in his eyes. 

“Your dad?” I asked. 

He nodded, “We had a fight, just before I...”  

Now I understood. 

“I told him I hated him, that I couldn't wait to get away from him. But, I didn't mean any of it, I was just angry.” 

“What was the fight about?” I asked. 

Jimmy shrugged, “I can't even remember, we fought so much about anything and everything, we were just so different. I’d give anything to take it all back.” 

I nodded and got up. 

“What are you doing?” 

I didn't answer, just kept on walking. I stepped through the doors of the hardware store the man had entered and saw him behind the counter a thermos of coffee in one hand and a newspaper in the other.  

“Excuse me, sir.” I said stepping up and clearing my throat. 

He smiled, “Early bird huh? What can I help you with today?” 

“Um, you don't know me, and this is gonna sound a little strange, but I knew your son, Jimmy.” 

He blinked and looked me over, “Okay.”  

“I just wanted to tell you that he was a good friend. He had a great heart, and he spoke very fondly of you.” 

The smiled sadly, “You must not have known him too well. We didn't really get along, especially near the end.”  

“Everyone has rough patches, that's part of life. He loved you; he may not have shown it at the time. But he always loved you.” 

There were tears in the man's eyes, but he held them back as he nodded again. “Well, thank you, young man. I really needed to hear that.” 

Jimmy was standing outside, waiting for me, tears in his eyes as well. “Thank you, Jonas. Thank you for that.” 

I just shrugged and looked at the rising sun, “Morning already, I'm starving.”  

“Oh hey, you still have the coupon.” he said. 

I dug around in my pocket and pulled out the receipt, crumpled and with a drop of blood on one corner but still readable. I smiled. 

“One small soda please, and my free regular fries.” I said, placing the coupon down on the counter. 

The cashier took it and looked it over, before hissing through his teeth, “Ooh sorry sir, this coupon is only good if you purchase a Cluckey combo.” 

I sighed, “Really?” 

He nodded and slid the coupon back across the counter to me, “I'm afraid so.” 

“So, I have to buy a combo with fries to get the free fries?” 

“That is correct sir.” 

I shook my head and laughed. 

“Would you still like the small soda?” he asked. 

 

I stepped out of Captain Cluckey’s, small soda in hand. “Yo Jimmy, you're not gonna believe this.” 

... 

“Jimmy?” I said again. 

... 

I glanced around for him, but I already knew. I smiled and chuckled to myself, as I pulled out my last cigarette and headed for the bus station.  

“Goodbye Jimmy.” ",1,1750378775.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Please read below for details and thanks for any advice you can offer.**

Have always had a short hair fetish, tried many different styles from mild to wild but all could pass as masc or femme depending on my whim so I was never too concerned until one of the women at yoga (who I have complimented on her short bob many times) asked me casually about walking in with regular clothes, come out of the locker room with femme baggy thin loose pants, top and femme styled hair then after class change back. Got to know her well enough over coffee and scones to open up over time, explained I was exploring my gender identity I feel most comfortable with. That's when she explained how I'll never know unless I truly embrace that identity 24/7 without being able to change back and forth when I want to.

That led to discussions that a new haircut/style would be a good way to start, she has been a master stylist for over 28 years, owns a salon that provides a welcoming supportive environment for those interested in gender affirming haircuts. Made me feel comfortable telling her I'd been thinking about a short bob. Grew my hair out to below collar thick and full over a long period of time, she kept it trimmed at the ends, ears and bangs and styled as it and as it grew longer over my collar she gave me an undercut with the clippers. Could put my hair up in a pony tail to show it off in class, stores, the office etc andstyle it to show it or not show it. Felt very bold and confident with this style yet no matter how hard I tried I could not shake the feeling I wanted to get a femme haircut I could not change out of.

Decided it may be time, walked into a regular scheduled trim appointment with her in my baggy thin loose large femme skirt pants, matching top, white tennis slippers. She greeted me, told me it'll be about 10 minutes, have a coffee make yourself comfortable...then as she turned to walk back to her station got a close up view of her freshly shaved nape/bob, neatly shaved weight line and gave her a quick compliment. Became very nervous in the waiting area, would I follow through or not, do I really want to wear a femme bob  after seeing how hers looks? After seeing hers up close decided during that time that while I love the style on her just could not envision myself in that style 24/7.

Then she came out, says follow me back hun, spins the chair for me to sit, get a few more glimpses of her bob, could not resist complimenting her again. As she capes me, baggy skirt pants flowing over the sides and front of the chair made me look and feel quite femme, she she runs her comb and fingers through my hair asking so what are we doing today hun, basic trim or something different? Told her I like her bob again, she asks if I'd like one. sort of joking and sort of serious. Replied would I look good in one, she says absolutely. That when I got really nervous, asked her how short, feel the back of her hand on my nape as she says ""about here"" could not really tell felt like she placed her hand at lower ear level so I agreed lets give it a try, can always change back if I don't like it.

She says wonderful and then instead of reaching for the small cordless clippers she uses to trim my nape and undercut she opened up her lower drawer, pulls out big hot pink clippers (which she told me later were special ordered limited edition Oster76's) as she is untangling the cord asked her what those are for as she says they'll take off more of my bulk than her small clippers. Before I say anything and ask more questions she snapped them on, loud whirring sound, snaps a blade off and a new one on, spins me around facing the wall tells me to tilt my head down and stay still and felt the loud whirring in my ears as she pressed he blades into my nape hair slid down all over.

Felt air on my nape as it came off, told her it feels short, she says yuppers hun it sure is, getting you all bobbed n shaved up nice n short. That when I knew I was going to be walking out of there with a femme bob, I literally felt it happening and I knew I could not hold back anymore and even if I wasn't it didn't matter at that point I was getting a bobbed short, thanked her and told her to please make sure she shaves my hair into a very short femme pixie bowled bob.

About 3 hours later walked out of the salon with a full perm color shaved pixie bowled bob and pierced ears. 2 weeks later she re-shaved my nape and bob line and bangs (snipped off at my hairline), stays how she cut and shaved it all the time, no way to change out of it, looks and feels femme, sometimes I like it a lot like in class or at the office but it is drastic, no matter what I wear or where I go it looks and feels very femme, have regularly scheduled appointments to keep it maintained. Quite the shock as I like some aspects of it but others feel a bit insecure, but cant change out of it.

Last week went to dinner and an an art gallery with some clients 2 days after my retrim, liked it at more relaxed dinner in the corner of the restaurant with my back against the wall, got positive very comments from one of the women but when we went to the art gallery felt so insecure with the bright lights shining on my freshly shaved nape and bobbed bowl line exposed for all to see, even tried turning to the side, still looks femme, same thing with the front with my bangs snipped off so short. Taking more time than anticipated to adjust. Has anyone else had a similar experience? 

She sure was right that a feminine shaved bob will prevent me from changing back and forth, my bob/weight line is very high up my nape, nape shaved bare with clippers below my bob line which also goes just over tops of my ears on the side, bangs snipped off short, looks femme form any angle, have regular appts to keep it maintained this way, trying to adjust, only way out of it if I cant take it is to buy clippers and shave it all off bald but that is not an option, she would be very upset and would not do my hair anymore, my supervisor at the office loves it hope I keep it this way, if she had no snipped my bangs off at my hairline might of been able to get a different short style but not now, this is what happens when a stylist knows what needs to be done and you re-enforce it by telling her to make sure she shaved it into a very short feminine shaved pixie bowled bob.",4,1750378774.0,trans,1,0.83,False

21M. Born in Bangladesh but lived most of my life outside. Currently doing undergrad abroad and came to Bangladesh for a 4 months vacation. Bored and tired for doing nothing. Don't have much friends here. Tried to make contact with random  people  but seemed like they don't like me or find something weird about me. My cousin goes to scholastica and I did hang out with her friends, I bonded really well with them. But can't be or chat with them online always as there's a large age gap. I did talk to 2 bracu guy and girl in my building amd they also seemed fine. Any tips on how can I get to know some BRAC/NSU(other places also fine as long as they have a good vibe)people? I mentioned these 2 places cause I have some pleasant experience with them. I'm open to chat and talk online. Hang out at coffee places sometimes.

1lfq9qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lfq9qn/free_regular_fries/,Free Regular Fries...,"Free regular fries... 

That was what brought me into Captain Cluckey's that day. I stood there in line behind two middle aged women who were taking a rather long time to place their order. Where is my mind by the Pixies played over the restaurant speakers. Over the music I could hear the man in the dirty ragged clothes out front, still yelling about the end of days. I did my best to ignore him, just like everyone else. I turned back to look out the window, past the ragged man and across the street to the bus station. I thought about how I should have been out of this backwoods town and on my way back to Chicago by now. Unfortunately, my car had broken down a mile outside of the town of Pleasence. The town mechanic said he could have the part in sometime next week, but I had no intention of hanging around that long. Double unfortunately, the bus to the city didn't run until the next morning. So, for the time being, I was marooned here. 

 I glanced down at the receipt in my hand, the attached coupon read, Free regular fries with next purchase. I had gotten a Clucky combo meal earlier that day and with nothing else to do, I decided to grab my extra fries and loiter around town till morning. I was low on cash, so a room at the local motel wasn't in the cards. 

I checked my watch, 7:35PM. “Only about 13 hours to go.” I thought to myself. I glanced up to the ladies ahead of me, still talking over their order. The door chimed behind me and a group of teenagers came in, laughing and talking loudly. I gave them a cursory glance and noticed one of them wore clothes that weren't quite in the style of the others, an old letterman jacket and jeans instead of the tee shirts and shorts the others wore. I noticed the bruising on his throat and made a note to myself to not make eye contact with that particular young man. I was sandwiched between the two chatty Kathys and the obnoxious teenagers and my social anxiety was climbing to a fever pitch. Not only that, but the nicotine itch was beginning to set in. I shrugged to myself and stepped out of line; I was in no hurry after all.  

Stepping out into the warm summer evening, I looked up orange and purple sky. The sky seemed so clear out here away from the city. I pulled my crumpled pack of cigarettes out of the pocket of my thrift store Hawaiian shirt as the ragged man continued his tirade a few feet away from me. I lit my cigarette and continued to ignore him. After a moment he noticed me and stepped over, directly in front of me.  

“THEY ARE HERE! YOU ALL MUST LEAVE THIS PLACE! DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY ARE BENEATH US! THEY ARE AMONG US! AND THEY WILL COME FOR YOU ALL! YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE TRUTH; YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT COMES AFTER BUT YOU ARE ALL WRONG! ALL OF YOU! THEY WILL DEVOUR YOU! THEY WILL HOLLOW YOU OUT AND FILL YOU WITH HATRED AND ROT! ROT! ROT! 

I inhaled the smoke and focused on the setting sun, doing my best to ignore the man's putrid breath as he screamed in my face. I exhaled and watched the smoke drift through the man's face before calmly moving to lean against the restaurant wall. I didn't react to the man, didn't acknowledge him. I couldn't, if I did, he would never leave me alone. Eventually he went back to his place on the sidewalk and started his speech all over again. I glanced over at him, standing there shouting, begging to be heard, preaching his heart out to an absent congregation. I pitied him, what he was. I wondered at the circumstances that brought him to that place.  

After smoking another cigarette and doom scrolling on my phone for a few minutes, I went back inside and found that the line had dissipated. The cashier from earlier was gone, replaced by a pimple faced kid with a name tag that read, Jimmy. His head hung low as I approached the counter. Probably looking at his phone, I thought. 

“Welcome to Captain Cluckey's, how may I help you?”  

His voice carried such melancholy that I assumed those other teens had been giving the poor kid a hard time.  

“I'll take a small soda and a free regular fries.” I said laying the coupon on the counter.  

The kid looked up at me slowly, his eyes finding mine and studying me for a moment. Suddenly his mouth dropped open in a dopey smile and he turned and headed back into the kitchen muttering something about being right back. I stood there, confused. “The hell was that about?” I wondered.  

After a few minutes, the cashier from earlier came out from the kitchen and saw me. 

“Sorry about the wait sir, what can I get you?” He said stepping up to the counter. 

I squinted and looked back to the kitchen, “What happened to the other guy?”  

“Other guy?” He asked. “What other guy?” 

Then it hit me. “Shit.” I muttered under my breath. 

I glanced around the restaurant. The chatty Kathys were nearby, watching me curiously. From their point of view, I had just placed my order to thin air. So, I looked like a crazy person. That was fine, maybe I was. Who the fuck cares? 

I looked back to the group of teens, they were still in their own world, still being obnoxious. But the out of place one, he was watching me now. I did my best not to meet his eyes, but I knew he could see me. He knew I could see him. I fucked up. 

“Looks like it's time to go.” I thought. I turned to head for the door and saw the ragged man standing outside. I needed to compose myself before leaving, I was rattled. I needed to clear my head; be alone for a moment. In the bathroom I splashed water on my face and studied myself in the mirror. I looked older than my 25 years. My shaggy sandy blonde hair was now streaked with silver, and the lines on my face were more care worn than they once were. 

“Hi there!” Came the voice from behind me.  

Jimmy, the other cashier, was there. I tried to act like I didn't hear him, looked through him when I turned around, tried all the usual tricks. But when I went to open the door, Jimmy stepped in my way, and I hesitated. 

“I know you can see me.” He said, his eyes burrowing into mine.  

Yeah, the jig was up. I do my best to avoid these situations, otherwise they never leave me alone, always seems to be just a little more unfinished business. I sighed, “What do you want?” 

He laughed, “How?” He asked. “How can you see me? Can you see others?” 

I shook my head, “Doesn't matter. I can see you, I can hear you. Tell me what you want or leave me alone.”  

“Okay, Okay.” He said. “I'm sorry, I just... I haven't spoken to anyone in... Well, I'm not sure how long. Your car broke down right? It's a small town, people gossip, and all I can do is listen. Well, until now.” He smiled wide. 

I nodded and made a get on with it motion.  

“Well, there are others here. They want what I want, maybe you can talk to them too? I’ll go...” 

“No!” I demanded, grabbing his arm before he could leave. “No others, that's the deal. You already know, I can't change that. I help you and you never mention this to anyone else. Got it?” 

He stared down at my hand on his arm, “Holy crap, you can actually touch me.” His eyes shot up to mine.  

“Thats the deal, got it?”  

He nodded, “Okay, I mean, yeah deal.”  

I let go of his arm; icy pain was radiating up my arm from my hand. I’ll never get used to how it feels to touch the dead, they have substance but at the same time they don't. Like trying to hold on to frozen mist. 

“So, what do you want?” I asked again. 

He smiled, “Well, my name is Jimmy.” He said pointing at his nametag. “And I was murdered.” He turned to show me a series of stab wounds on his back.  

I nodded, “And you want me to find the killer, right?”  

“Oh, no.” He said, still smiling, “I know who it was. He got away with it, but he died a few months ago. Heart attack, and he saw me as he passed. It was very cathartic.”  

“Okay. So, what do you want?” I asked. 

“Weeell. Here’s the thing, and you might want to brace yourself because this is a big ask... What was your name by the way?” 

“My name is Jonas.” I said. “Now please for the love of God, tell me what you want.” 

“Oh, like the Weezer song, neat. Okay, well here goes. So, the man that killed me, also killed several other people around town, mostly just drifters and the like, no one who would be missed. Only he wasn't the only one. He was actually a member of some kind of cult based here in Pleasence. I'm not sure what their practices or goals are, aside from killing lots of folks. But I do know that whatever they are planning, it will be coming to a head soon. I've heard lots of hushed talk about the new moon and rituals and a lot of other such stuff. I think they want to open some kind of doorway to somewhere, but I really can't be sure. You really never can tell with these culty types. So, my request is that you, Jonas, seek out the members of this cult and put a stop to whatever they're cooking up.”  

I took a breath and blew out my cheeks. “So, there's a cult?” 

“Yes.” 

“And they are doing something big on the new moon?” 

He nodded, “Correct.”  

“Which is tonight.” 

His smile faltered a little but didn't go away altogether, “Um, I guess so.” 

I leaned back against the sink and crossed my arms, ""So, you want me; one mentally unstable guy, to find and stop a whole ass cult from opening up some kind of doorway or something? And you want me to do it tonight? Like right now? Does that about sum it up?” 

His smile had completely melted away as I laid it all out. He said, “I mean, it sounds like a lot when you say it like that.” 

“Goodbye Jimmy.” I said as I brushed past him and out the door. 

Of course, he followed me, “Hey wait!” He yelled across the restaurant as I made my way to the exit. 

“Don't follow me.” I said over my shoulder. 

“Are you alright sir?” The cashier asked as I passed the counter.  

I ignored him and pushed through the door, also ignoring the still ranting ragged man on the sidewalk. If the kid was right and there really was some kind of cult here, doing something tonight. I wanted to get as far away from here as possible. I was halfway down the block when I heard the dead cashier calling out to me again. 

“I know it's a lot, but what are the odds of you, of all people, showing up here right at this time. Thats either one heck of a coincidence or you are meant to be here. I believe you are here for a reason Jonas.” 

I pulled out my phone and held it to my ear. If anyone happened to be watching, I was just taking a phone call, “I'm here because my car broke down, there is no other reason. Besides even if I wanted to help, it isn't possible. I don't know the first thing about dealing with cults or whatever. Now stop following me.” 

“It is possible if we work together, if we have faith...” 

“Faith?” I laughed, “Faith in what? In people? The universe? “God?” 

“How can you not have faith? With your gift...”  

“Gift? My Gift?” I said, cutting him off. “You wanna talk about gifts, about beliefs?” I shook my head, “Let me tell you a story. See, the original owner of the house I grew up in fell asleep with a lit cigarette in his hand. The house was almost a total loss, but my folks happened to come along and got the place for a steal. Would you like to take a guess which room he died in?” I asked. “Every night he stood the foot of my bed, tears running down burnt and blackened cheeks, going on and on about how he was a good Christian. How he shouldn't still be here. And when he found out I could see him...” 

“What happened?”  

“He screamed, raged, begged me to help him, demanded I help him.” 

“And did you?” 

“I was 9 years old. What the fuck could I have done?” 

Jimmy said nothing so I continued, “It wasn't long after that, he realized he could make physical contact with me.” 

Jimmy winced. 

“Yeah, now he had someone to take out all his anger and frustration on.” 

“Didn't you tell your parents?” He asked. 

“Of course I did, and they sent me to therapy. And therapy led to doctors, which led to medication, then to psyche wards. No one believed me. Do you have any idea how many people die in those places? Do you think they move on when they do?” I shook my head, “I just thought the burned man was bad. Is that your idea of a gift?” 

He began to speak, then trailed off. 

“Yeah, I wouldn't know what to say either. You wanna know what I believe kid? I believe that God, if he's even still around, either hates us or doesn't give a shit about us anymore.” 

‘Thats not true.” He said. 

I chuckled, “Look at yourself kid, if you’re such a faithful believer, then why are you still here?” 

“I don't know!” he shouted, “But there has to be a reason, I have to believe I'm here for something.” 

I shrugged at him and turned to leave. “Sorry, kid. I'm all out of Faith.” 

“Please, Jonas.” He continued. “Fine, don't do it for me, or faith or God or any of that. Do it for the innocents that haven't died yet.  Please help me stop them from killing anyone else.” 

I stopped. I didn't want to deal with this, didn't want to know about some cult in the middle of nowhere. But now I did, and if he was right, people could die tonight, innocent people. How would I feel if I could have stopped it and didn't? What would that kind of decision do to whatever is left of my own soul. Shouldn't I at least look into it and see if anything can be done. I sighed, “God dammit.”  

Jimmy smiled when I turned around. 

“Where and when is this ritual happening?” I asked. 

“So, you'll help?” 

“I don't know. I don't know if there's anything I can do. But I have nothing else to do and nowhere to go so I might as well check it out. So, where's it happening?” 

He shrugged, “I don't know for sure where, but it has to be happening soon right?” 

I looked as the last rays of sunlight sank below the horizon, “Yeah, I'd say so. Okay, do you know of any other members of the cult? Where do they live?” 

Jimmy thought for a moment. “I know that Mr. Paterson, the school science teacher, and Greasy Bob, the guy who runs the gas station, are both members. I've heard them discussing some horrible things inside Cluckey's. But I've never been to where they live, you'd have to go without me.” 

“Shit.” Funny thing about ghosts, if they had never been there when they were alive, they can't go there when they're dead. “No, if I'm doing this, I'll need someone watching my back.” 

Just then flashing red and blue lights pulled up next to me and stopped. Jimmy stood there, his legs vanishing into the hood of the town sheriff's car. 

“Evening son.” He said it friendly enough, though he eyed me suspiciously.  

“Evening.” I nodded back in greeting. “What can I do for you officer.” 

He pushed an oversized cowboy hat up on his head, “Well we got a call about somebody out here by the Cluckey's having conversations with himself. Would you happen to know anything about that?” 

I smiled, “Oh yeah, sorry about that. I must look like a crazy person. I was talking on the phone; I have a Bluetooth earpiece.” I said pointing at my ear, which was fortunately covered by my long hair. 

The sheriff nodded, “Oh I see. Well, I suppose that makes a little more sense. Although, you're not from around here, are you? What brings you to town?” 

“No sir, my car broke down and is in the shop here. Should be fixed sometime next week but I'm leaving on the bus in the morning.” 

“Okay, so where are you staying tonight?” He asked. 

I shrugged, “Honestly, I haven't quite figured that out yet.” 

He studied me for a moment, “Well we have a fine motel in town, and if needs be we have a cell or two empty at the station. Come on by, if you can't find somewhere. It aint the Ritz but you won't be on the street.” 

I smiled and nodded, “Thank you sir, I might just do that.” 

He nodded back, “Tell them Sheriff Reed sent you.” And with that, he drove off, leaving me alone again, sort of alone. 

“I got it.” Said Jimmy. “Old Mrs. Thompson. She runs the pharmacy, and she used to give me piano lessons when I was a kid.” 

“And she's part of the cult?” I asked dubiously. 

“I mean, I don't know for sure. But she was always such a hateful woman, and I did see her talking with the science teacher and greasy Bob a few times.” He shrugged, “Although everyone around here talks to everyone at some point, could be just coincidence.” 

“Do we have any other options?” I asked 

He shrugged again, “Not really.” 

“Okay then.” I said, “Let's go see old Mrs. Thompson, the evil pharmacist.” 

 

Ten minutes later, we were standing in front of a large old farmhouse with a long winding fence lined driveway, complete with a dilapidated red barn and grain silo. 

“This is the place.” Said Jimmy. “So, what's the plan?” 

“Does this place look too picture perfect to you?” I asked. 

“What do you mean?”  

I shook my head, “Never mind. So, what happened to Mr. Evil pharmacist?” 

“Oh, he passed years ago. Poor man had a stroke while tending the field.” 

“A stroke huh?” I asked. Turning to look at him halfway up the long dirt drive. 

“Yeah, bless his heart.” 

“I'm guessing you haven't been back here since you died?” 

“No, why?”  

I stopped and pointed towards the barn, “Because he's still hanging from the tree next to the barn.” 

He looked to where I was pointing to see the late Mr. Thompson. He was in fact still there; his hands bound with the same blue nylon rope as was around his neck. His eyes bulged as they followed us up the drive.  

Jimmy’s mouth dropped open in shock, “Well that dirty rotten liar. Why would he go and do a thing like that?” 

“Look again kid, most people don't bother tying their hands to kill themselves.” 

He gasped, “That means...”  

I nodded. 

Jimmy shook his head, “Poor Edgar. Well, that seals it, she has to be one of them.” 

“I think you're right.” I said pointing to the house.  

The old woman stepped out of the front door and walked over to an old pickup; she was wearing some kind of dark cloak or robe. She started the truck, and the headlights illuminated the drive. 

“Get down.” I said as I ducked behind a bush next to the fence line, then realized who I was talking to and mentally kicked myself. I took the kick back when Jimmy did in fact get down behind the bush next to me. 

The truck passed, probably going to wherever the ritual would be taking place. I briefly considered diving into the truck bed as it passed but quickly dismissed the idea. It was moving too fast, and I didn't think I was stealthy enough to get in without making a sound. 

When we were sure the truck was gone, we made our way to the farmhouse. I was hoping I could find some clue as to where the ritual would be.  

Jimmy stepped through the front door and waved to me through the glass; I grinned and flipped him off.  

“Can you see anything?” I asked. 

“I don't know what to look for.” He said waving his arms.  

I sighed, “Are there any schedules or notes stuck to the fridge that say big secret cult thing at this time. Anything like that?” 

“No, nothing here in the front room, which is the only room I have ever been in. Well, and the bathroom one time but I don't think we will find anything in there.” 

“Damn. Okay, I’ll find a way in.” 

I was hoping this was one of those country towns you hear about, where everyone is so friendly they don't even bother locking their doors. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with a locked and deadbolted front and back door. But not totally disappointed, I found one of the side windows had been left cracked open.  

I slid open the window and looked in, it was the kitchen. I climbed inside, careful not to knock over any of the dozens of dishes stacked precariously by the sink. I looked around the kitchen and dining room. Apparently there had been some big feast here, and all of the food was just left out. 

“What the hell?” 

“What is it?” Jimmy called from the front room. 

“Is Mrs. Thompson a bit of a slob?” 

“What? No not at all, she's always been very tidy.” 

 “It looks like she had company, like a lot of company. A big dinner or something but they didn't clean any of it up. All the food and dishes are just left out.” 

“Why would they do that?”  

“I'm not sure, unless they thought there was no need to clean up.” 

“Like they weren't coming back.” Jimmy continued. 

I left the disaster of a kitchen and made my way into the front room. Jimmy was staring out the window at Mr. Thompson, dangling from the tree. 

“Isn't there something you can do for him?” he asked. 

I shrugged, “I don't know, he most likely can't speak, and even if he could, he seems to be bound there.”  

I started searching through the papers on Mrs. Thompsons desk. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Jimmys head sink low. I cleared my throat, “I'm hoping, that stopping whatever his wife is doing will be enough to set him free.” He nodded slightly, and I went back to my search. 

“Anything yet?” Jimmy asked as I came back from searching the bedroom. 

“No.” I grumbled as I plopped down on the couch and pulled out my cigarettes. 

“Oh Mrs. Thompson hates smoking, you shouldn't...” He started then stopped when he saw the look I gave him. He nodded and smiled awkwardly, “Right, evil cult lady. Wish I could have one, really stick it to her.” 

I lit my cigarette and chuckled. “How did you die anyway?” I asked. 

He looked down at his feet for a moment then took a calming breath, “Well, it was a typical Tuesday night for the most part, only we weren't as busy as we usually were. My boss, Dave, told me I could take the night off early. He said he was gonna close soon anyway, had some work to do at the church or something. I thanked him and headed out the door. I had been home for about an hour when I realized that I forgot to clock out. I was tempted to just say “Oh well” and fix my timecard on my next shift... But I always had to be a goody two shoes, that's what my brother used to say anyway.” He took another deep steadying breath before continuing.  “When I walked back into the office to clock out, I noticed the back door was open. I could hear voices but couldn't make them out. So, I got closer and peered out through the open door. Dave was there, but he wasn't alone. Greasy Bob was there, and another man that I didn't know, He was an older man, with white curly hair and dirty clothes. They had him hogtied in the bed on Bobs truck. He looked up at me and moaned something through the duct tape covering his mouth. I don't know what it was, but his eyes pleaded for me to do something. Dave had been telling greasy Bob something about where to take the man, but he stopped at the man's moans for help. They turned around and saw me and I ran, I tried to anyway, but I wasn't quick enough.” He sighed, long and sad, “And that was the end of me.”  

I breathed out a lung full of smoke, “Fuck... I'm sorry.” 

He nodded and continued, “Afterward, when I figured out I was dead, I learned about the cult. Like I said, Mr. Paterson and greasy Bob would come into Cluckey’s and discuss things. And there were always rumors around town about...” He trailed off. 

I looked up at him, “What?”  

“The rumors, I never thought about it until now but...” 

“What rumors Jimmy?” I demanded. 

He was pacing the floor, “The old chapel on the edge of town. When I was a kid the older teens at school always used to tell us stories about it being haunted, but I never really believed any of it.” 

I gave him a look that said, “Really?” 

He shrugged, “Well, that was before. And I still don't think its haunted, I mean maybe it is but that's not all. They used to tell stories about seeing dark hooded figures coming and going from the chapel on certain nights. Holy crap, Jonas. I think that's the ritual site.” 

He smiled and put up his hand for a high five, “come on Jonas, let’s go stop a cult!” 

I grinned and got up, putting my cigarette out on the couch and slapping his hand, “Lets fucking go.” 

We left the Thompson house and headed for the old chapel. I checked my watch, 9:40PM. “Still a couple hours till midnight.” I thought to myself. I had no idea if midnight mattered but it seemed like the time to do culty ritual shit to me. 

 

It took about 25 minutes to walk across town to the old chapel, even at a brisk pace. We were about 100 yards away from the chapel when Jimmy came to a dead stop. 

“What are you doing?” I asked turning back to face him.  

“I can't go any farther.” he said demonstrating by walking forward and not actually moving. “Other kids would go to the chapel on dares, but this is as far as I ever made it.” 

“God dammit.” I muttered, “Okay. Well, I guess I’ll go see what I can do. You stay here and keep a watch out.” 

“For what?” He asked. 

“I don't know, just yell if you see anything.”  

“What are you going to do?”  

I shrugged, “I’ll figure something out.”  

I crouched down in the tall grass by the road and crept up to the big creepy old building. “What the fuck am I doing?” I kept asking myself. 

The old chapel was, old to say the least. It had once been painted white but was now almost all bare wood, only a few chips of paint still clung to the weathered boards here and there. The windows looked like they had all been broken and boarded up, and a faint orange light poured out from between the boards. The steeple stood tall but warped at an odd angle, and the large cross that stood up on it was partially broken off, making it resemble a capital T. 

I could hear hushed voices inside, chanting low and ominously. I crept up to a window and tried to see inside but my view was blocked by old pews shoved against the sides. Through the boards, I could see the ceiling of the chapel, there was a large hole in the roof. If I could get up there, I could get a better view of what was happening.  

I crept my way around to the back of the building and found the old Mrs. Thompson's pickup. Luckily it had been parked right up next to the building. I climbed on top of the truck's cab as quietly as I could, then scrambled my way onto the roof, a little less quietly. The roof boards creaked under my weight, and I held my breath, hoping no one had noticed. When there was no sign of anyone coming to see what the noise was, I made my way further up the roof, crawling on my belly. 

When I reached the edge of the hole, I peered down to see a dozen people. Most of them were dressed in dark robes with hoods up. They walked in a circle around a large pentagram drawn on the floor. Another man stood at the alter holding a large leatherbound book. He wore a white robe and hood. I leaned out to see better and the boards began to creak more. Suddenly they gave way, and I fell down into the midst of them in a heap of rubble, luckily some poor bastard broke my fall.  

The assembled cultists jumped back at my sudden arrival, then one by one, they all gathered round to look down at me. 

“So, I guess this isn't AA?” I said between coughs. 

“You!” Said the man in white, who I guessed was the leader.  

He removed his hood and glared at me; it was Sheriff Reed.  

“Evening again, officer. I think I'll take that cell now.” I said as I climbed to my feet. 

“The son of a bitch killed Bob.” Said one of the cultists behind me. 

“What the hell are you doing here?”  

“I was gonna ask you the same thing?” I said, “But I think I already know.” 

He squinted at me, “Whatever you think you know, you're wrong.” 

“So, you're not trying to open a doorway to hell and let out a whole bunch of nasty shit? Pretty much fucking up the whole world.” 

The cultists around me started muttering to each other. 

“We are doing the world a favor. I know you can't see that, but you will.” He said as a smile spread on his face. “You will soon see firsthand. Since you robbed us of one of our number, your blood will have to do.”  

I looked back to see the cultist I had landed on; his neck twisted at an unforgiving angle. “Oops.”  

“Hold him.” Said the sheriff. 

I looked around and recognized one of the hooded figures approaching me. 

“Hey Mrs. Thompson. Edgar says hello, or at least he would if the rope hadn't crushed his throat.” 

She stumbled back in surprise, “What? How...”  

But I didn't wait for her to finish. My foot shot out, connecting with the nutsack of the man in front of me. He crumpled to the ground as I pivoted and threw a punch at the next cultist, their nose crunched audibly and blood splattered Mrs. Thompson. Unfortunately, that was about all the damage I managed to do. I tried to fight but there were too many. suddenly, something hard impacted the back of my head and the last thought that ran through my head as my vision went dark was, “Well, shit. This is how I die.”  

 

I came to some time later. My hands cuffed around a pillar at the back of the chapel. The cultists were chanting something in some language I couldn't understand, maybe Latin? I wasn't sure. I could feel blood, sticky on the side of my face. I tried to move but the cuffs would let me get far. 

“You’re awake.” said the sheriff. “Just in time.” 

I stood, as well as I could, “In time for what? To watch you fuck up the whole world?” 

“To watch us save it. And you, whoever you are, get to be a part of it. Though you don't deserve it.” 

The sheriff went back to his place behind the alter and raised his hands addressing the assembly. “My friends. Tonight is the long-awaited night. You have all worked so hard to get us to this point and I am so very grateful to you all.”  

The cultists gave polite cheers and applauded. 

“This world is sick my friends, and it will only get sicker. We must stop it. We must bring about the great cleanse.” 

They applauded louder. 

“Just as God cleansed the earth with the great flood, we must now bring upon it the power of the cleansing flame! Only then will the world know true peace and righteousness again!” 

The cultists shouted with joy. 

“The hour approaches, bring out the sacrifice!” 

The cultist came and uncuffed me from the pillar, I tried to get away but it was no use. They drug me to the center of the pentagram. Sheriff Reed approached me, the book and a knife in his hands. 

“You must have really bad luck son. You see, Bob there had volunteered to be the sacrifice. But since you decided to drop in and break his damn neck, looks like you’re it.” 

I squirmed in the cultists grip, “How do you even know this will work? Don't I have to be willing or something?” 

Someone punched me in the gut, causing me to gasp for air. As he approached, he pricked his finger with the knife. My shirt was ripped open and began drawing something on my chest. 

“Doesn't say anything about willing, only that the sacrifice be marked with the sigil. Which now, you are.” 

The sheriff opened the book and began reading a passage. The language he spoke, it made no sense, it hurt my head to hear. My vision blurred and cleared then blurred again. I thought I would pass out, then I saw it. Through the hole in the ceiling of the chapel, stood a huge, emaciated figure. Towering high and blocking out the night sky, its flesh the color of ash. Two massive wings spread out, flexing and stretching, eager to take flight. There were charred and broken skeletons dangling from the thing's coal black antlers. Its face was like that of a jackal and its eyes were deep set and burning with a fire so hot I could feel the heat from them. As it looked down at me, I saw visions of scorched cities and towns, the oceans boiled and the whole world burned. I knew that there would be no peace on earth, there would be nothing left but ash and ruin if this thing got out. I could not let that happen. 

I looked back at Sheriff Reed just in time to see him plunging the knife straight at my heart. I had no other choice. I did something I absolutely hated. Something I had only done once before. I clenched every muscle in my body, and I shifted myself out of the living plane. Every cell in my body screamed out in agonizing pain. It felt like dying, which I guess it kind of was. I could only hold it for a few seconds, but it was enough. The knife passed through me and into the chest of the cultist behind me. I shifted back and fell to the floor, looking back at the cultist with the blade buried in his chest.  

Everyone gasped, the sheriff started to say something but was cut off by the cultists blood curdling scream. His body began to stretch and expand as skin ripped, and bones snapped. Suddenly his eyes caught fire, and his body exploded. Showering everyone with chunks of gore. Just as quickly, the cultist who had been next to him began screaming as his eyes caught fire. I jumped to me feet and ran for the door. I heard the wet pop as the next one exploded and the screaming continued. I shoved through the door and slammed it closed behind me. Maybe I'm an asshole for barring the door shut with them inside. But I did it anyway.  

One by one the screaming stopped, accompanied by the sound of 9 more people exploding from the inside out. Then came a great deep howling roar that seemed to shake the earth, car alarms went off, dogs and coyotes howled in the distance. The tone was so low, I felt like my eardrums would burst. There was the sound of strong winds like a hurricane, heat radiated from the edges of the chapel door. Then all at once the roaring and wind sound faded away into nothing. 

 After a few minutes, when I was pretty sure it was all over, I opened the door and stepped inside. The blood and gore that had to have covered the place was burnt to ash, but the robes lay there still, empty and smoldering but whole. I walked across the floor to what stood at the center of the ash covered room. The book, it completely unharmed. I bent down to pick it up and read the inscription on the cover, Liber Vitae, Mortis et Ultra. “Whatever that means.” I thought. No clue how those yokels got ahold of something like this, but I figured I had better hang on to it. Wouldn't want it to fall into the wrong hands, again. 

Jimmy was standing there waiting for me as I approached, “Jonas! Are you alright? What happened? And what was that thing standing over the chapel? “And why are you covered in blood? Eww” 

I laughed and patted him on the shoulder, “Let's get out of here, I'll tell you on the way.” 

On the way back into town we stopped by a pond where I rinsed the blood off of my shirt and out of my hair, didn't need anyone asking complicated questions. Jimmy was doing enough of that already. I told him what had happened and how I stopped the cult through sheer stupid luck.  

“You mean you went ghost mode?” he asked, grinning like a kid. 

I shook my head, “First off, that's fucking stupid and I'm not calling it that. Second, I really don't know what it is or how I do it. It just seems to be something I can do, though it hurts like hell and I never want to do it again.” 

A firetruck passed as we walked back up the street towards the bus stop, it looked like it was headed for Mrs. Thompsons place.  

We sat together on a bench next to the bus station and talked for a while. Jimmy told me stories about his life growing up in the small town, we laughed and joked together. I wondered to myself what was still keeping him here, I had assumed that once this was over, he could move on.   

It turned out I had been unconscious for longer than I first thought. My watch and phone had broken at some point, so I had no clue what time it actually was. As we sat there talking like two old friends, I could see the first rays of the sun peaking over the treetops. 

Jimmy stopped halfway through a story; his eyes focused on a man a few blocks away. The man was maybe in his mid 50s, with thinning gray hair and a thick mustache. The man stopped to unlock the front door of a hardware store. I looked back to Jimmy and saw tears in his eyes. 

“Your dad?” I asked. 

He nodded, “We had a fight, just before I...”  

Now I understood. 

“I told him I hated him, that I couldn't wait to get away from him. But, I didn't mean any of it, I was just angry.” 

“What was the fight about?” I asked. 

Jimmy shrugged, “I can't even remember, we fought so much about anything and everything, we were just so different. I’d give anything to take it all back.” 

I nodded and got up. 

“What are you doing?” 

I didn't answer, just kept on walking. I stepped through the doors of the hardware store the man had entered and saw him behind the counter a thermos of coffee in one hand and a newspaper in the other.  

“Excuse me, sir.” I said stepping up and clearing my throat. 

He smiled, “Early bird huh? What can I help you with today?” 

“Um, you don't know me, and this is gonna sound a little strange, but I knew your son, Jimmy.” 

He blinked and looked me over, “Okay.”  

“I just wanted to tell you that he was a good friend. He had a great heart, and he spoke very fondly of you.” 

The smiled sadly, “You must not have known him too well. We didn't really get along, especially near the end.”  

“Everyone has rough patches, that's part of life. He loved you; he may not have shown it at the time. But he always loved you.” 

There were tears in the man's eyes, but he held them back as he nodded again. “Well, thank you, young man. I really needed to hear that.” 

Jimmy was standing outside, waiting for me, tears in his eyes as well. “Thank you, Jonas. Thank you for that.” 

I just shrugged and looked at the rising sun, “Morning already, I'm starving.”  

“Oh hey, you still have the coupon.” he said. 

I dug around in my pocket and pulled out the receipt, crumpled and with a drop of blood on one corner but still readable. I smiled. 

“One small soda please, and my free regular fries.” I said, placing the coupon down on the counter. 

The cashier took it and looked it over, before hissing through his teeth, “Ooh sorry sir, this coupon is only good if you purchase a Cluckey combo.” 

I sighed, “Really?” 

He nodded and slid the coupon back across the counter to me, “I'm afraid so.” 

“So, I have to buy a combo with fries to get the free fries?” 

“That is correct sir.” 

I shook my head and laughed. 

“Would you still like the small soda?” he asked. 

 

I stepped out of Captain Cluckey’s, small soda in hand. “Yo Jimmy, you're not gonna believe this.” 

... 

“Jimmy?” I said again. 

... 

I glanced around for him, but I already knew. I smiled and chuckled to myself, as I pulled out my last cigarette and headed for the bus station.

Seriously, if you’re not paying attention to this, you might want to adjust your radar.

So what’s all the fuss about? Let's unpack it!

**What is this magic potion?**  
Drumroll, please... it's *moringa*! Yep, that leafy green miracle worker that's been part of Ayurvedic medicine for centuries. People are raving about it, and for good reason:

- **Packed with Nutrients**: Moringa leaves are rich in vitamins A, C, and E, plus plenty of calcium and iron. Talk about a nutrient bomb!
- **Antioxidant Properties**: Who doesn’t want to fight off free radicals? Moringa is like a shield for your body. 
- **Energy Boost**: Forget coffee jitters! Moringa is known to balance your energy naturally without the crash (you know what I'm saying!). 
- **Supports Healthy Digestion**: A happy gut often means a happy life. Moringa has been linked to improved digestion!

**But wait, it gets better!**  
Think of it as your all-in-one supplement that your fridge may have been hoarding (okay, not really—but you know what I mean!). Plus, it’s so versatile! You can throw it in smoothies, soups, or even pasta. Why not turn your dinner into an ancient banquet?

And let's be real for a minute; haven’t we all felt overwhelmed by the sea of wellness trends out there? Keto, paleo, intermittent fasting… sometimes, it feels like trying to decipher the Da Vinci code. But moringa cuts through the noise. It's simple, it’s natural, and it’s been around longer than all those trends put together.

**So, why should you care?**  
- **Health Goals**: If you're working on being healthier, adding moringa can be your little secret weapon. Seriously, imagine looking at your goals and saying, ""I got this!"" 
- **Community Support**: The excitement in the Reddit threads is contagious. People sharing their stories, success, and experiences. It’s like a little family cheering each other on!
- **Meaningful Results**: We believe in meaningful results. That’s why a lot of folks are hopping on board. They’re not just taking it for the hype; they’re actually feeling the impact it has in their daily lives. If you’re curious, check it out [here](https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb).

And hey, let’s not forget the good old-fashioned humor! **Can we just appreciate that something our ancestors swore by might actually be what we need?** I mean, if they managed to keep things together without Instagram and Netflix, maybe they were onto something!

We're in a world where information is everywhere, and at times it feels overwhelming. It’s refreshing to find something that feels grounded and *real*, isn’t it? 

So what are your thoughts? Have you tried moringa, or are you diving into the wellness world? Let’s chat about it!",1,1750378209.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

This is Part 2 of my original military/apocalyptic fiction series, World on Fire. If you haven’t read Part 1 (The Return), you’ll want to start there. This chapter takes place just days after our unit returned from deployment in Ukraine, as things begin to unravel back home. This story focuses on grounded realism, slow-burn tension, and a boots-on-the-ground perspective of how an outbreak really begins. Feedback is wanted and always appreciated. Part 3 is already in progress.

World on Fire part 2 ""The waiting Game"" 

The convoy rolled off I-76 just before first light. Akron sat below us, quiet. Not empty, just paused. Like the whole city was holding its breath. The skyline was gray, the horizon flat and muted as if the world had been drained of color overnight. No sirens. No traffic. Just the low hum of distant generators and the faint, persistent whistle of wind through dead branches.

We had been back from Ukraine less than ten days when the order came down. No rest. No decompression. Just a classified tasking, full kit, tight manifest. Orders came via FRAGO. Nothing detailed. Nobody said the word “outbreak.” Nobody had to. We’d seen the same headlines everyone else had. Strange attacks in Cleveland. Civilian unrest in Youngstown. A National Guard unit in Toledo had gone dark, radio silence for eighteen hours before they pinged once with garbled comms and dropped off again. Nothing confirmed. Just enough to make every man in our squad stop sleeping right.

Reynolds stepped off the lead vehicle while we dismounted and formed up. He didn’t yell. He never had to.

“Alright, listen in. This is a containment-assist tasking. No direct action unless fired upon. Civilians are still in the area. ROE is standard. PID before trigger. Maintain squad integrity, maintain radio discipline, and if something doesn’t feel right, you call it up.”

We copied in low unison. Nothing fancy. Just a synced-up readiness. Eight of us, broken into two fire teams. Loadouts were clean. No extras, no escalation. Our presence was meant to reassure, not alarm. Not yet.

The west side of Akron looked abandoned, but not in the apocalyptic way. This was Ohio — it had always looked tired. Storefronts shuttered. Trash drifting against curbs. Streetlights flickering at odd intervals. Still, there was movement. A jogger. Someone pulling their blinds. A parked cruiser with no one in it.

Diaz was running the sector map on his tablet, trailing beside me.

“Checkpoint’s at the old Rolling Acres site,” he muttered. “Actually scratch that, it’s an Amazon DC now. Rebuilt a few years ago.”

I nodded. No point in saying anything. We’d seen enough of these converted facilities overseas — structures built fast, stripped of identity, sterile as hell. What mattered was what was inside.

The perimeter was reinforced — newer fencing, fresh welds, concertina wire rolled out with zero rust. Not standard for a logistics depot. Gate security looked like a patchwork of PMC and contracted local hands. No uniforms matched. One guy wore body armor over a college hoodie. They didn’t check our IDs, just waved us through with that hollow look you only see in people who’ve already seen too much.

Inside, floor operations were mostly shut down. The place was quiet, sterile. Forklifts were parked. No belt movement. Fluorescents buzzing overhead with no other sound underneath. We passed a break room with the door hanging open. Inside, empty chairs, an overturned coffee thermos, and a half-eaten sandwich abandoned on a table. Little things. Out of place.

The plant manager, mid-40s, civilian attire, eyes bloodshot, escorted us into a side office. She had a half-printed incident report in her hand, trembling slightly.

“One of our overnight sorters collapsed during shift change. Looked like a seizure at first. Two coworkers tried to help him. He bit one of them. Hard. Drew blood. EMTs were called. When they got here, he was gone. No one saw him leave. Cameras blacked out for fourteen minutes between 0331 and 0345. IT says it was a system fault. We've never had that happen before.”

Reynolds didn’t take notes. Just nodded once and looked at me.

“Alpha 1-1, you’re clearing the sublevel with 1-2. Bravo team holds outer perimeter with security. No lethal unless hostile. Report every movement. Gloves on. Full PPE if contact is made.”

“Copy, Alpha Actual,” I said.

Diaz and I checked comms and moved toward the loading bay. A service stairwell ran along the north wall. Power to the lower floor had been cut — intentional or not, nobody could tell. Emergency lights cast dull red streaks across concrete walls. The air was heavy and wet, like a place that hadn’t breathed in years.

“Alpha 1-1, entering sublevel now. Two-man sweep. Marking ingress,” I said over comms.

“Copy, 1-1. Maintain comms every 30 seconds. Call sign if compromised,” came Reynolds’ reply.

We moved slow, covering corners, checking shelves and shadowed gaps between supply cages. There were signs of a struggle. A knocked-over mop bucket. Bloody smears across a service locker. A trail of something dark moving along the concrete toward a janitor’s closet.

I took the door. Diaz covered. I reached for the handle.

“Ready,” I whispered.

“Send it,” he replied.

I opened low and quick. Inside, a man crouched in the far corner. Shirtless. Covered in blood — not actively bleeding, but layered in dark red, caked along his arms and neck. His nails were torn, fingertips scraped raw. He stared straight ahead like we weren’t there.

“Alpha 1-1, we’ve got one male, alive. Possible altered mental state. No visible injuries, but covered in blood. Unresponsive to verbal commands. Requesting guidance, over.”

There was a pause.

Diaz took a knee, stepping in slowly with restraint straps ready.

“Sir, we’re here to help you. Don’t move,” he said.

The man didn’t blink. Then, quietly, he whispered, “It’s in the walls.”

Diaz and I froze.

I leaned in slightly, mic hot.

“Subject is speaking. Disoriented. Whispered phrase was ‘it’s in the walls.’ Still non-aggressive,” I said.

Diaz reached forward.

The man lunged — not at us, but at the drywall beside him, slamming his head against it with enough force to splinter the surface.

“Hold him!” I barked.

We moved fast, restrained him without striking. He laughed. Quiet at first, then louder, like he was remembering something instead of reacting. The laughter stopped as fast as it started. He collapsed into silence.

We bagged his hands. No resistance. Diaz checked vitals. Pulse was erratic. Pupils dilated. Skin cold.

“They just rolled in armed. No warning. No, no one’s saying it’s that. But… it feels like it.”

Diaz stepped up beside me.

“Feels wrong, Staff. Like we’re standing on the edge of something, and everyone else already fell off.”

I didn’t answer. I didn’t need to. We both knew.

We took her to the vet and can’t afford an MRI or CT scan, so we really don’t know what’s going on, other than that it’s neurological and we’re giving her antibiotics, anti inflammatory meds, and motion sickness meds.

If she doesn’t improve in a week, then my vet insinuated that we should probably put her down. I feel terrible even though I know that no matter what it is, it isn’t my fault, but I feel awful having to look at her and just see that she isn’t really there. Her eyes aren’t moving as violently as they were before, but now she has this really bad head tilt, and her balance is worse.

I was wondering if anybody had heard of anything similar, or had something similar happen to them and what that was like and the outcome of it. Thank you!",1,1750378145.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False
1lfq3y3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1lfq3y3/seeing_desd_people/,Seeing desd people?,"I think I might be seeing people who have just died.

In my town, there’s a website that lists people who’ve recently passed — it includes their name, date of death, and a photo. I check it regularly, and sometimes something strange happens: I’ll see a photo of someone who supposedly died a few days ago, but I clearly remember seeing them out and about after that date.

For example, today I went to the hospital and saw an elderly woman. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Later, I went to the shopping centre for a coffee — and I saw the same woman again. That alone was odd, seeing her twice in different places back to back. But this evening, I went on the deaths site — and there she was, listed as having died five days ago.

What stood out about her was how gray she looked — not in an obviously sick way, just… muted, like the colour had drained from her. Apart from that, she looked completely normal, as if she was just going about her day. Almost like she didn’t even know she had passed — if it was the same woman. I can’t say with full certainty, but the resemblance was striking.

Of course, it’s possible it was someone who simply looked very similar. But this isn’t the first time this has happened to me — and I’m starting to wonder if it happens more than we realise.

1lfq2j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1lfq2j3/ltheanine_ltyrosine_and_vyvanse/,"L-Theanine, L-Tyrosine, and Vyvanse","I just bought 200 MG L-Theanine and 500 MG L-Tyrosine capsules after reading about the positives experiences shared on this sub. I also bought 600 MG Ashwagandha capsules. 

Initially, I decided to try L-Theanine and L-Tyrosine after it’s been mentioned here that they can act as boosters but also reduce the anxiety side effects of Vyvanse. In my case, I usually get some anxiety between 2-3 hours after taking my Vyvanse. 

I took today one capsule of each of the above supplements with my 40 MG Vyvanse. The anxiety was significantly diminished today, but I also felt less productive and somewhat sleepy. As a consequence, I stopped working 3 hours after taking Vyvanse; never felt the initial motivation I normally experience to get stuff done, and thus did not feel like doing anything else after that. My work involves a lot of programming, so I kept looking at my codes and was like “nah I don’t feel like editing and fixing this.” This lack of motivation and productivity I experienced today after taking these supplements concerns me as I usually can work for about 6-7(max 8) hours after taking my medication. I also don’t particularly experience any crash (aside from maybe feeling slightly burnt out after 7-8 hours of taking my dose, which, as of now, I have considered to be normal[?]). 

So, given the many amazing things I have read about L-Theanine and L-Tyrosine on this sub, I’m thinking maybe I’m not taking these supplements correctly (maybe the timing). My question is, how should I be taking these supplements? My main goals are, potentially, to slightly extend the duration of my Vyvanse and to diminish “peak hours” anxiety. I would appreciate any tips, recommendations, and experiences. 

PS: I also drink coffee (~20 oz ice latte or frozen drink like Starbucks Frappuccino) about 30 min to 1 hr of taking Vyvanse and drink it slowly for about 45min - 1 hour (Ik I just love my iced/frozen coffee so much)  ",3,1750378007.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

This is Part 2 of my original military/apocalyptic fiction series, World on Fire. If you haven’t read Part 1 (The Return), you’ll want to start there. This chapter takes place just days after our unit returned from deployment in Ukraine, as things begin to unravel back home. This story focuses on grounded realism, slow-burn tension, and a boots-on-the-ground perspective of how an outbreak really begins. Feedback is wanted and always appreciated. Part 3 is already in progress.

World on Fire part 2 ""The waiting Game"" 

The convoy rolled off I-76 just before first light. Akron sat below us, quiet. Not empty, just paused. Like the whole city was holding its breath. The skyline was gray, the horizon flat and muted as if the world had been drained of color overnight. No sirens. No traffic. Just the low hum of distant generators and the faint, persistent whistle of wind through dead branches.

We had been back from Ukraine less than ten days when the order came down. No rest. No decompression. Just a classified tasking, full kit, tight manifest. Orders came via FRAGO. Nothing detailed. Nobody said the word “outbreak.” Nobody had to. We’d seen the same headlines everyone else had. Strange attacks in Cleveland. Civilian unrest in Youngstown. A National Guard unit in Toledo had gone dark, radio silence for eighteen hours before they pinged once with garbled comms and dropped off again. Nothing confirmed. Just enough to make every man in our squad stop sleeping right.

Reynolds stepped off the lead vehicle while we dismounted and formed up. He didn’t yell. He never had to.

“Alright, listen in. This is a containment-assist tasking. No direct action unless fired upon. Civilians are still in the area. ROE is standard. PID before trigger. Maintain squad integrity, maintain radio discipline, and if something doesn’t feel right, you call it up.”

We copied in low unison. Nothing fancy. Just a synced-up readiness. Eight of us, broken into two fire teams. Loadouts were clean. No extras, no escalation. Our presence was meant to reassure, not alarm. Not yet.

The west side of Akron looked abandoned, but not in the apocalyptic way. This was Ohio — it had always looked tired. Storefronts shuttered. Trash drifting against curbs. Streetlights flickering at odd intervals. Still, there was movement. A jogger. Someone pulling their blinds. A parked cruiser with no one in it.

Diaz was running the sector map on his tablet, trailing beside me.

“Checkpoint’s at the old Rolling Acres site,” he muttered. “Actually scratch that, it’s an Amazon DC now. Rebuilt a few years ago.”

I nodded. No point in saying anything. We’d seen enough of these converted facilities overseas — structures built fast, stripped of identity, sterile as hell. What mattered was what was inside.

The perimeter was reinforced — newer fencing, fresh welds, concertina wire rolled out with zero rust. Not standard for a logistics depot. Gate security looked like a patchwork of PMC and contracted local hands. No uniforms matched. One guy wore body armor over a college hoodie. They didn’t check our IDs, just waved us through with that hollow look you only see in people who’ve already seen too much.

Inside, floor operations were mostly shut down. The place was quiet, sterile. Forklifts were parked. No belt movement. Fluorescents buzzing overhead with no other sound underneath. We passed a break room with the door hanging open. Inside, empty chairs, an overturned coffee thermos, and a half-eaten sandwich abandoned on a table. Little things. Out of place.

The plant manager, mid-40s, civilian attire, eyes bloodshot, escorted us into a side office. She had a half-printed incident report in her hand, trembling slightly.

“One of our overnight sorters collapsed during shift change. Looked like a seizure at first. Two coworkers tried to help him. He bit one of them. Hard. Drew blood. EMTs were called. When they got here, he was gone. No one saw him leave. Cameras blacked out for fourteen minutes between 0331 and 0345. IT says it was a system fault. We've never had that happen before.”

Reynolds didn’t take notes. Just nodded once and looked at me.

“Alpha 1-1, you’re clearing the sublevel with 1-2. Bravo team holds outer perimeter with security. No lethal unless hostile. Report every movement. Gloves on. Full PPE if contact is made.”

“Copy, Alpha Actual,” I said.

Diaz and I checked comms and moved toward the loading bay. A service stairwell ran along the north wall. Power to the lower floor had been cut — intentional or not, nobody could tell. Emergency lights cast dull red streaks across concrete walls. The air was heavy and wet, like a place that hadn’t breathed in years.

“Alpha 1-1, entering sublevel now. Two-man sweep. Marking ingress,” I said over comms.

“Copy, 1-1. Maintain comms every 30 seconds. Call sign if compromised,” came Reynolds’ reply.

We moved slow, covering corners, checking shelves and shadowed gaps between supply cages. There were signs of a struggle. A knocked-over mop bucket. Bloody smears across a service locker. A trail of something dark moving along the concrete toward a janitor’s closet.

I took the door. Diaz covered. I reached for the handle.

“Ready,” I whispered.

“Send it,” he replied.

I opened low and quick. Inside, a man crouched in the far corner. Shirtless. Covered in blood — not actively bleeding, but layered in dark red, caked along his arms and neck. His nails were torn, fingertips scraped raw. He stared straight ahead like we weren’t there.

“Alpha 1-1, we’ve got one male, alive. Possible altered mental state. No visible injuries, but covered in blood. Unresponsive to verbal commands. Requesting guidance, over.”

There was a pause.

“Copy, 1-1. Proceed with non-lethal detain. Avoid skin contact. Repeat, avoid direct contact. Gloves on, mask on,” Reynolds said.

Diaz took a knee, stepping in slowly with restraint straps ready.

“Sir, we’re here to help you. Don’t move,” he said.

I might have briefly heard it on the radio or streaming, and then looked it up on youtube. But it definitely wasn't something that was topping charts. Swore I saved it, but I can't find it anywhere. Given that I played it over and over for months I probably thought I would remember it forever lol. I now remember only the tiniest pieces of it so I apologize for such a horrible description. 

Female singer and I believe the group name was simply her name. The song sounded like a lilting pop song with some country flair. When I looked into her other songs / albums, they were definitely much more country. So this might have been a brief crossover into pop. 

I think her first name started with an M. Like Michelle or Michaela or something. But then sometimes I feel like the letter A was prominent like Anna or something. 

It was a sweet little love song. I seem to recall one of the opening lines being about putting on a pot of coffee? I think they were on a road trip or maybe on the road as musicians? I think a cat was mentioned as was maybe playing cards, but that's fuzzier. It was definitely a theme of just living our life, maybe it doesn't look like other people's lives, but it works for us, and we're just happy like this, etc. Also, I think, a theme of keeping things simple?

It's been eating at my brain the past few weeks, maybe after the 10-year anniversary of his death, I don't know. But who knows, even with these crappy details, maybe it will ring a bell with someone.

I hope my words are clear.

‏A few days ago, I went to the café I usually go to almost every morning. I was standing on the left, waiting for my turn to order. On the right, there was a college student waiting to get his order. While we were standing there, a loud man came in. He greeted the student and started asking him about his studies and how things were going. Then he started bragging about himself and giving advice.

‏From the first moment, I felt uncomfortable. My gut was telling me to leave right away. The student got his coffee and left, and I was left alone with the man.

‏When I started giving my order to the cashier, the man interrupted me and told the cashier to take his order first. But I kept going and finished my order. He thought I would stay quiet if he interrupted me, but I didn’t. Then he turned to me, sighed, looked me up and down, and asked what kind of coffee I got in a sarcastic voice.

‏I didn’t reply. He repeated the question, louder and angrier, and said, “Hey, I asked you a question. Answer me.” I kept ignoring him, but inside I felt like I was shrinking. Then he said, “Looks like the pretty girl is deaf.”

‏At that moment, I really wanted to throw my coffee on him and leave. But I didn’t. I just took the receipt, paid, grabbed my coffee, and left quietly.

‏Now, his voice, his tone, his anger just because I didn’t want to talk to him, and the way he verbally harassed me—it’s all stuck in my head. I feel a bit angry that I didn’t say anything or protect myself like I should have. I’ve never been in a situation like this in public before, so it was really shocking and scary.

I'm visiting your city for a quick layover and need some advice on my planned 7-hour itinerary in downtown Houston. I'm coming off a red-eye flight, so I'll be pretty tired, but I'm excited to explore! Here's what I'm thinking—let me know your thoughts, tips, or anything I should tweak.

**Details:**

* **Arrival**: Taking the 102 bus from IAH, arriving downtown around 8 AM.
* **Departure**: Catching the 102 bus back to IAH for a 6:30 PM flight.
* **Energy Level**: Exhausted from the red-eye, so I'm keeping things chill but want to make the most of my time.

**Itinerary:**

1. **8:00 AM - Coffee to Start**: Thinking of hitting either *Boomtown Coffee* or *Day 6 Coffee* to wake up. Which one’s better for a cozy vibe and strong coffee? Any must-try drinks or snacks?
2. **9:00 AM - Tranquility Park**: Planning to stroll through here for some calm greenery. Is it worth the stop, or is there a better nearby park for a quick visit?
3. **10:00 AM - Julia Ideson Building**: Heard this library is gorgeous. Is it open to visitors in the morning? Any tips for checking it out?
4. **11:00 AM - Walk Around Main Street**: Want to soak in the downtown vibe, maybe snap some photos. Any cool spots, street art, or quick stops along Main Street I should hit?
5. **12:30 PM - Lunch at Pappas Bar-B-Q**: Craving some Texas BBQ. Is Pappas a solid choice downtown, or is there a better BBQ spot nearby? Any menu recs?
6. **2:00 PM - Buffer Time**: Left some wiggle room to linger or add a spontaneous stop. Any suggestions for something low-key nearby (museums, shops, etc.)?
7. **3:00 PM - Head Back**: Plan to catch the 102 bus back to IAH to arrive by 5:00 PM for my flight.

**Questions:**

* Does this plan make sense for a tired traveler with limited time?
* Any must-see spots I’m missing that are easy to fit in?
* Tips for navigating downtown or using the 102 bus?
* Should I prioritize one coffee shop over the other, or is there a better spot?
* Is Pappas Bar-B-Q good, or should I go somewhere else for lunch?

He brought you along, though he barely looked your way. Meetings, phone calls, late nights at the office—he left you alone more than with him. I noticed the frustration in your eyes… the loneliness.

At first, we barely spoke. Then came the small talk over coffee, shared glances in the elevator, and conversations that went deeper than they should have. You asked me things—not just about the project, but about *me*. You said he doesn’t listen anymore, doesn’t see you.

That night at the hotel bar, he cancelled dinner again. You sat beside me instead. We drank. Talked. Laughed. And when your hand brushed against mine, neither of us pulled away.

Maybe it was wrong. Maybe it was inevitable.

Also appeared on: *The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills*, *Days of Our Lives*, *Melrose Place* (Taylor), *Sex, Lies, & Obsession*, *Another Woman’s Husband*, *Soap Talk* (Host)

In 2014, Rinna joined the main cast of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills for the show’s fifth season. Her casting is often credited with ‘saving’ the series midway through its run, delivering a substantial boost in ratings after Lisa’s addition to the cast. She acknowledged in a 2019 *Los Angeles Times* interview that being a Housewife brought her unprecedented attention. 

Lisa frequently steals the scene for the most hilarious and accurate commentary. From her iconic flared bob to her varied collection of wigs and matching personas, Rinna’s impact on pop culture and RHOBH is unparalleled.

In season 11, Lisa found herself close with Erika Jayne amid her tumultuous legal troubles. Erika became a natural partner in crime for Lisa as another unfiltered lady. Lisa and Erika make as good friends as Lisa and Kim Richards made good enemies. Lisa Vanderpump also found herself butting heads with Rinna, often referring to each other dryly as ‘Vanderpump’ and ‘Rinna’.

On top of being familiar in the reality tv world, Lisa has acted in various soap opera roles. She played as Billie Reed on Days of Our Lives, as well as Taylor McBride on Melrose Place.

1lfpku1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1lfpku1/my_psychiatrist_just_told_me_that_green_tea_has/,My psychiatrist just told me that green tea has the highest amount of caffeine of any tea and I feel crazy.,"We were talking about supplements because I am having trouble sleeping. I asked for her opinion on L-theanine, and mentioned that I drink green tea.  She said ""Remember, green tea has the highest level of caffeine.""  I told her I have never once heard this, having only heard the opposite--that it is lower in caffeine than black tea & coffee.  She said ""No. That's not true,"" very firm that I and everything I have read was wrong.  

Believe me, as a chronically ill person I am well aware that there is plenty of easily found, prevailing wisdom that is totally wrong and that you need to really research, use critical thinking, and understand nuance when it comes to all things health and nutrition.  And that just bc the top results on google might confirm popular opinion doesn't mean there's not more to it.  However, this does not seem like one of those things, and both google and every tea company I've ordered from say that green tea is on the lower end.  She said the thing about caffeine 3 or 4 times, and a couple times used the term ""natural caffeine"" so idk if that's different or something; idk what natural would signify except to say caffeine that's not added, in the way fresh fruit has natural sugar--sugar exists in fresh fruit by definition and is not added.

Doctors have said some truly ignorant things to me lately, but have usually not been THIS adamant about something.  I doubt she hopped on google after our appointment so it leaves me to ask: Am I crazy here?  Any thoughts on why she said this?  ",82,1750376596.0,tea,87,0.95,False

I usually eat seafood for protein: oysters, shrimp, crab, scallops, salmon and tuna. I eat cheese: mozzarella, parmesan. I eat yogurt. I also enjoy outshine brand coconut popsicles (to excess). Recently while travelling I ate a lot of salted peanuts 

I workout with HIIT as often as possible. It used to be 15-20 days a month but with the fatigue of graves it has been down to 2-10 days. 

My doctor advised me to not eat seafood and stop working out. 

My liver enzymes were elevated after taking 11 doses of methimazole and I was advised to stop taking it. I also stopped drinking June 7 as the shortness of breath and fatigue are showing me this is serious. My liver enzymes came down a little on the labs yesterday and my doctor advised me to take 30 mg of Prednisone with the goal of lowering the thyroid hormone and then taking radioactive iodine and staying on steroids for 2-3 months. 

Before I go on the steroids I am going to try an extremely low iodine diet: steak (which I haven’t eaten since 1995) broccoli, black beans, lentils, no cheese, no yogurt, half and half in my one cup of coffee. No alcohol. No seafood.

1lfpgsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionLux/comments/1lfpgsi/the_beauty_sandwich_secret_sauce_review/,The Beauty Sandwich Secret Sauce Review,"I purchased the “Secret Sauce” by the brand The Beauty Sandwich, which I heard little to no buzz about, so I thought I’d post a review for anyone else who’s curious. 

First thoughts: this is the ultimate “nice to have” product but unlikely to be anyone’s skincare staple. 

The packaging is cute, coming in a coffee bag and plenty of tissue paper. It’s a tad gimmicky but sure, whatever. 

The product has a slight botanical scent similar to True Botanicals oils but is fainter. The texture is smooth and soaks up quickly rather than sitting on top of the skin because it has a thinner consistency than most oils. In fact, they don’t call it an oil, they say it’s somewhere between an oil, serum, and primer which is pretty accurate. Because it exists in this in between state I don’t think it replaces any one product type but would be used in addition to serums, oils, etc. 

Efficacy: it’s only been a few days but I don’t see any significant changes after using it. It’s somewhat moisturizing and my skin looks a little glowy, but I don’t think it’s doing significant work compared to other products with more actives. I appreciate websites with before and after photos to give a better sense of the target goals of a product but they don’t post any. It layers well with my other products and doesn’t leave skin feeling over saturated. Based on the ingredients I consider this a decadent multivitamin for the skin which might support other skincare products performing their own improvements to skin. 

Price: at $300 it’s on the higher side for ancillary products. That coupled with the lack of clear intended benefits in their marketing and I’m left confused. The economies of scale can hugely impact price and because this is a fledgling line, maybe their production isn’t high enough to lower costs. Personally, I don’t think this product should retail over $150 given all the competition. 

So, this serum/oil/primer is nice to have and depending on your spending comfort level might be a nice addition. But based on my brief experience so far, this exists in a limbo space for me. It’s nice enough but I really recommend you find a sample to try prior to buying.

Overall: 5/10 

I hope this helps any people curious about the product! ",10,1750376272.0,SkincareAddictionLux,3,0.92,False

Specifically, the section on scaling sustainably resonated with me.It's easy to get caught up in the growth hype and overextend, but the book really emphasizes the importance of building a solid financial foundation *before* expanding production or distribution. It highlighted how even something like offering free shipping could decimate profit margins if not planned carefully.

Thinking about examples of craft businesses I know, you see this played out all the time. Some local breweries struggle to expand beyond their taproom, while others manage to get wider distribution and maintain quality. Similarly, some autonomous coffee roasters can survive and thrive even with bigger chains nearby. It makes you wonder what specific financial strategies these prosperous craft ventures employ to navigate those challenges.

Has anyone else read this book, or have experience in the craft/artisanal business world? what are some unconventional, yet effective, economic strategies you've seen or implemented to achieve long-term success?

I have an extra guest pass for the upcoming ABT performance of Sylvia at the Met Opera House (Lincoln Center) on Wednesday, July 10th at 7:30 PM, and I’m hoping to find a wonderful woman to join me for what could be a beautiful and memorable evening.

I’m 35, a well-educated working professional based in NYC—grounded, thoughtful, and someone who enjoys the arts, engaging conversation, and experiences that make for lasting memories. Whether you’re a longtime ballet fan or simply curious, this could be a special night.

No pressure at all on your end—everything’s already set, and I’d just love to share the experience with the right person.

If you’re open to it, I’d love to meet sometime before the show—perhaps for a relaxed coffee or walk—to get to know each other a bit and build a natural vibe before the evening. I find a little familiarity makes a night out even more enjoyable.

Here’s the show link if you’d like to take a peek: 👉 https://www.abt.org/ballet/sylvia

If this resonates with you, feel free to DM. Whether it’s simply an elegant night at the ballet or something more if the chemistry aligns—I’m open to wherever the connection leads.

This is a bit of a long shot, but I can’t get this encounter out of my head and I’d really like to find this girl again. Maybe someone here knows her, or maybe she even sees this herself.

Between October and December 2024, I took Bus 120 from Obertrum to Salzburg. The bus was really full that day, and since there were no seats left, I asked a girl if I could sit next to her. She kindly offered me a chewing gum, and we started talking. We had a great conversation about movies – she told me she loved horror films, Marvel, and Stranger Things.

I really wanted to ask for her Instagram or Snapchat, but I was too shy when I had to get off the bus. I’ve regretted it ever since.

Here’s what I remember about her:
• She had blonde hair
• She was 18 at the time
• Her zodiac sign is Capricorn
• She finished her last year at the Landesberufsschule in Obertrum am See – I think the class was 3HGAa (Zweig HGA)
• She works for her parents now
• She lives near the Christian-Doppler-Abendgymnasium in Salzburg

I know this might sound crazy, but I’d really love to reconnect. If anyone recognizes this description or if you’re reading this and think it might be you – I’d love to invite you for a coffee. I had a strong feeling that we connected and I haven’t forgotten that moment.

Thanks in advance to anyone who might help!

Recently I decided to just jot down the first few words that come to mind after having a cup. And I finally got thru each of the June drop, Colorfull collab, and generous freebies. Granted each wasn’t dialed in but I got a fairly good cup across the board w/ the settings listed. 

1:15 ratio. 8 on Pietro Pro.
9g if I used Deep27 (Aramse recipe) 15g for switch (Coffe Chronicles recipe)

Favorite: OBADIAH (Fuyan) 
Least Favorite: ROGUE WAVE (Ethiopian 74110)


Colorfull Typica A - oolong, peach, clean
Colorfull Musumba lot 3 - Juicyfruit, sweet
Colorfull Tabi - rasberry, cherry, candy, mouthfeel
Colorfull caturra/bourbon washed coferment - melon high chew 

Obadiah Fuyan China - berries, complex, great mouthfeel

Rogue Wave Lo Loma XO rum barrel - boozy, grape
Rogue wave Ethiopian 74110 - clean coffee, nothing special 

AMOC Ombligon - white flowers, pear, pineapple (close 2nd fav w/ Mirra)

Mirra 74158 Landrace - blueberry muffin 

Prodigal El Cedro Pink bourbon - stonefruit, clean but has a bite

Little waves Red Bourbon Rwanda - fruit punch, bubblegum, boozy 

Moonwake - still resting



Curious to see what notes you guys got, and what your favorite of the last drop was?",6,1750375002.0,coffeerotation,5,0.88,False

I stayed at Clarion Inn Harpers Ferry on June 14–15, 2025, as part of a school retreat. The experience was deeply disappointing and, frankly, alarming in terms of guest safety and accessibility.

👉 Despite a clear request (through our group organizer) for a handicap-accessible room—critical for my companion who had recent open-heart surgery—we were assigned a room at the far end of a long corridor, completely unsuitable for someone with serious medical needs.

👉 When we returned from our group dinner and discovered this at 10 PM, there were no practical options to move rooms. My companion had to endure unnecessary physical strain.

👉 The mini-fridge was unusable, packed with gallon containers, and both bedside lamps were broken.

👉 During breakfast, I became seriously ill after coffee with milk. I rushed to the restroom only to find no toilet paper. Despite requesting assistance, no staff came—I had to wait until another guest helped. This incident contributed to two days of illness and distress.

👉 What made this worse: I was verbally promised a refund by the Director of Sales. However, this promise was not honored until I repeatedly escalated the issue. Even then, they only agreed to refund the original fee—not any compensation for the health impact or broken commitments.

👉 Their final communication was that they’ve referred the case to their lawyer and insurance company rather than truly addressing the guest harm caused.

I am sharing this so other guests—especially those with accessibility needs or health sensitivities—are aware. This was not a minor service glitch; it was a serious failure in guest care. I will not stay at any Choice Hotels property again.

AND ANOTHER COINCIDENCE MOMENT FOR ME FROM JESS, JESUS CHRIST!

The funniest thing here is that literally when I was JUST AROUND their age, I was obsessed with leopard print too & I had an iconic leopard dress that I wore to the mall + ABT Store (pretty well known in IL, USA where I'm from)! I still have the picture in my kid album back home. Srly Jess, how much more do our ideas on storyelling, interests, & my life have to interconnect with yours?!

  
Adding on, to the coincidences, yes, she's blond & when I just their age, I was an unrecognizable literal blond too when no one in my family was either till later I naturally turned to a dark brown hair color, I won't be surprised one bit if Jessabelle has the same later!",3,1750374816.0,aphmaufandom,3,0.72,False

# Ingredients

* 80g strong brewed espresso
* 60 g Maple syrup
* 50 g cocoa powder
* 150 g active sourdough starter
* 220g lukewarm water
* 550 g bread flour
* 10 g salt
* 110 g chocolate chips (plus extra for folding)

# Instructions

1. **Mix** coffee, maple syrup, and cocoa in a bowl; let sit for 5 minutes.
2. **Combine** with the ripe sourdough starter.
3. **Add** bread flour, & water; mix into a shaggy dough.
4. **Cover** and let rest for 1 hour.
5. **Add** salt now with a smidge of water to mix in well.
6. **Incorporate** chocolate chips during the last stretch & fold which is more of a lamination to layer in.
7. **Shape** the dough, place in a proofing basket, and refrigerate overnight. Tins also work.
8. **Bake** at 400°F (200°C) in a Dutch oven for about 60 minutes. 
   * If using steam injection, use 5m of 100% steam, then make at 350°F for 30m with 425°F for 10m to brown the top if necessary.

Enjoy. (I doubled it for the 3 in the picture)

1lfovyv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lfovyv,Can I get you guys' thoughts on my wife's sticker book project?,"Hey guys,  
  
My wife and I collect a crap ton of stickers and had been using a scrapbook to store them all. But she wanted a way to actually use the stickers in case she found a place for them — or at least have them on display instead of tucked away. There are a few sticker journals out there that are cool, but they didn’t really feel like something you’d want to leave out as a display item.  
  
She sells stickers, bumper stickers, and pins on her Etsy and Shopify, so she posted the idea to some of her customers and got a lot of feedback on Instagram and TikTok. She’s been building this prototype for a few months now and is super proud of it. I wanted to get y’all’s thoughts too, because I feel like Reddit (for better or worse lol) is actually a better platform for talking through ideas and projects.  
  
I probably should’ve posted this earlier, but she just launched it on Kickstarter for pre-orders with 11 different color options. Still totally open to feedback, and I’d love to hear what y’all think!  
  
Photos include ones of the prototype we have and one of the original sketch she used to map out the features.

I’m developing a project, where anyone around the world can adopt a real coffee tree. The idea is to create a human connection between the person who drinks the coffee… and the person who grows it.

Each tree will have a unique adoption code. The adopter will receive photos, updates, and the story of their tree — and in the future, they’ll receive coffee cultivated by the same farmer.

It’s not charity. It’s not a donation. It’s a symbolic subscription. I’m still building it all — logistics, storytelling, design… But this is the seed.

Do you think this make sense? Would you ever adopt a tree like this? How much could you pay for?

Any honest feedback is welcome — even brutal.

The phrase that will be part of this is:

Because your wake-up matters.

Thanks
