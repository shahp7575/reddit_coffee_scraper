Early spring brunches are all about keeping things easy. It may be a little too cold for comfortable outdoor tables, perhaps, but there is a welcome lack of winter hosting stress. It will be a casual weekend gathering, a leisurely celebration meal, perhaps, and brunch is a less formal meal than dinner, so go for a casual table setting.

The aim isn’t perfection but flow. A beautifully styled brunch table can be inviting, thoughtful, and simply easy on the eye. Using a few key elements, it’s possible to create a look that’s upscale but somehow very accessible, a space that encourages people to stay, refill their glasses, and breathe in the moment.

* **Begin With a Clean, Grounded Base**

Every effortless table is based on a solid foundation. Rather than setting a table with multiple cloths and decoration items, a single foundation bed can help anchor the table. This could be the surface of the table or an accent item.

Adding a [leather mat](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/leather-mat) for table design is a subtle yet effective way to upgrade your brunch spread. The leather mat keeps the surface safe and adds a dynamic and rich element that complements ceramics, glass, and nature perfectly. The leather material adds warmth without being heavy, and spring is the perfect time for balance and contrast between the cozy and new.

What ways can I achieve an attractive yet not-so-noticeable brunch table setup?

Keep the number of textures to a minimum. A simple table and a pop of a certain touch, such as a table runner or table mat, create a deliberate and not-too-much atmosphere.Harness the power of negative spaces.

* **Keep the Table Light and Functional**

The breakfast tables will work well in terms of functionality. The guests are served food, pour food, and move food from this table.

[Eco-friendly drinkware](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/drinkware) are the perfect blend. Environmentally friendly, light, and designed nicely, such products are comfortable to use when promoting the value of conscious hosting. No matter if it is water, juice, or coffee, the use of eco-friendly drinkware is an added charm that does not involve any hassle.

The table settings should keep it simple: one plate, few utensils, and beverageware that can be used for all drinks. This makes the table easy to manage throughout the brunch.

* **Is it all right to mix and match styles of drinkware for a brunch?**

Yes – as long as there's a thread that connects, whether by color or material. Mixing styles can be very intentional and laid-back, which works well for brunch. Similarity trumps matching.

* **Provide Comfortable Seating Around the Table**

The main difference between formal dinners is that brunches can easily go on for longer than expected. In fact, guests can stay for a while, with a chance to talk more, and with comfort playing a crucial role in these events, especially if everyone has to

The addition of the cushioned area seating in nearby seating areas, or breakfast nooks, helps facilitate an effortless experience when entertaining. The use of these cushions encourages guests to move freely between dining and other areas without diminishing the atmosphere. To facilitate effortless conversations among guests after dining, comfortable seating with cushioning is essential.

If your brunch spills outside or leads to a windowed corner area, then pillows will make the transition seem organic.

* **How do I arrange seating areas beyond the dining table to serve the purposes of a brunch?**

Think about zones. Keep dining seating areas clean and functional and add cushions or throws in nearby zones. It is an effective way for your guests to have choices without disrupting the flow of dining.

* **Let Spring Show Up Subtly**

Spring decor does not need any dramatic announcement. A few nature elements such as flowers, fruits, and leaves will suffice. Centerpieces should be low and light to avoid obstructing conversation and serving.

Couple these specifics with incorporating warm textures, such as a [leather mat for table](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/leather-mat), and neutral ceramics. The mix of raw details and textured elements gives this table a sense of seasonal, yet timeless, design.

* **Effortless Hosting Is About Intention** 

The most attractive early spring brunches appear effortless. When dining is set up on the table with comfort, practicality, and material consideration, entertaining is easier and more fun.

If you start your setup by grounding it on a leather mat for the table, use earth-friendly drink ware, as well as provide comfort for your guests through the use of [lounge chair cushions](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/sunbrella-cushions), the brunch will be relaxed, elegant, and inviting. Great events are the kind that seem spontaneous, not posing.",1,1768760130.0,u_TrafficMasterB,0,1.0,False
1qgfvme,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1qgfvme/well_i_should_get_somethin_for_the_inconvenience/,"""Well I should get SOMETHIN' for the inconvenience!""","Oh how I love the flight crews we house. They simply seem to get a *thrill* out of showing how much admiration burns in their hearts for us in return. Wait, did I say ""admiration?"" I meant *scorn*, with a dash of flaming-hot *entitlement*. Yet, it somehow always get serves cold.

This tale involves a flight attendant from ThatWay Airlines, who graced me with her presence after informing me of her room issues over the phone just moments prior. The HVAC unit was on the fritz, and my Maintenance team was unable to get it going. Thus, a room swap was in order; just a door or two down, at a still reasonable hour of the evening. And, seeing she was just with herself and her two company-permitted bags, all-in-all, it didn't seem like a titanic task.

It wasn't, but, you know, *it was*\--to her.

Before I was even writing the new room number down in the key packet, Ms. Madame made her declaration quite clear: ""So, I think I should be getting a meal voucher or *somethin*' for the inconvenience!""

For a few quick seconds, I had a hard reset in my brain; trying to calculate exactly *where* in this transaction did the dollars and cents (read: sense) add up to what she just said. That is, seeing that there were *no dollars and cents* to be spoken of, considering she was here on the company dime--doing her job.

It also goes without saying that, being in this very profession, she should know better than anyone how unfortunate circumstances have an ugly habit of rearing their heads without much forewarning. But, we work around them and simply press on. That's how these industries survive. 

Minor flight delays have added up over time in my wee little life, and I surely haven't gotten a sandwich for every situation. But, you know, who's counting?

In any case, I resisted the urge to respond to this lady with: ""Well, considering we're switching you to a new room you're still *not* paying for, there isn't really any further way to 'compensate' you.""

Instead, I instinctively began to reach for a 'Free Breakfast' voucher, but I thought for a split-second. That moved me to *instead* grab a nice little 'Free Coffee' voucher, for use at our café.

You might imagine how this went.

I simply handed her the voucher and cheerfully said: ""Here you go, ma'am. Sorry for the trouble.""

""What???! ***This*** is it?! You all don't have any real *meal* vouchers or something?"", she howled.

Ah, yes, now we're just flooring it in the race to become Mayor of Miserableville, aren't we?

I take just a quick second to compose and keep a straight face, and simply said, still cheerfully: ""I'm afraid that's all I have."" For the record, a fib I was not forcing. We *don't* have 'meal' vouchers, just the breakfast ones. Not the same. Either way, she'd be on the shuttle and gone the next morning before the restaurant even opened. So, coffee it was. And coffee, she scorned.

""I don't even drink coffee. I don't really think this is appropriate. You're already inconveniencing me with the heater, and then I had to come down here!"" \[Nobody told her she had to come down, she was just impatient.\]

Still trying to err on the side of being pleasant, I offered her to select a snack from the Marketplace. She pompously took me up on it, saying very matter-of-factly: ""See, now that's at least, *something* for my trouble.""

Very gracious one, indeed.

She sauntered away afterwards, and all I could do was look at my colleague--finally getting to unglue the smile from my face.",2,1768760127.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,1.0,False

I’m 21F, 165cm, around 68kg, office job. I walk every day and I’m starting a 10k steps a day challenge this month (I already do a 20 min walk on my lunch break).

The biggest issue is I’m always hungry. Even when I eat what should be maintenance, I feel like I’m thinking about food all the time. When I try to eat less (1200–1400), I get lightheaded and shaky around 2–3pm at work. I also have a lot of food noise and tend to binge eat at night, which I know doesn’t help.

As a reset, I’ve set myself a challenge starting today of no snacks or dessert after dinner, but I’m worried I’m just masking the problem instead of fixing it.

Typical workday:

\- 2tsp Chia seeds soaked in water with lemon juice around 7am

\- Breakfast around 10–11am at work (overnight Weet-Bix or yoghurt + berries, \\\~300–400 cals)

\- Lunch around 2pm is usually just fruit or yoghurt because I’m trying to save calories

\- Dinner is whatever my family cooks — I estimate portions and log in MFP but it’s not exact

Other info that might matter:

\- Lifelong chronic constipation

\- 3–4L water a day

\- 2 coffees a day

\- History of long COVID (mostly better now)

\- Stopped weightlifting because it felt like too much stress on my body with the inflammation from long covid, focusing on walking instead

\- Trying to look slimmer for a holiday in early March

I feel like I’m doing “the right things” but my body just doesn’t cooperate, and I don’t know if I’m under-eating, eating the wrong stuff, or if years of trying to diet have messed up my hunger cues.

Has anyone else dealt with this or have advice? I’m not trying to crash diet, I just don’t want to feel awful every afternoon. I’d love to lose a fair bit of weight for my holiday and not just put it straight back on.",1,1768760056.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

I think it’s all gone! This lipstick shade and this PARTICULAR lipstick is what I’ve worn for literally decades. There’s no comparison in my book. I’ve tried so many of their other shades and none are as flattering. I get compliments EVERY single time I wear 855. 

Years (possibly even 15 years ago) they discontinued the shade for some reason and I had to start buying them off eBay. Now, I can’t find that shade to save my life. I have to use my leftovers VERY sparingly and Only on special occasions. 

Aside from the shade, I SWEAR the formula was different because my old shade 855 ALWAYS lasts so so so much longer than Any other shade I’ll try today. 

Stop reading if you’re easily offended but…

I swear this lipstick was still PERFECT after a good 20 minutes of oral sex with my husband. We really had a good laugh about marketing this lipstick to porn stars and such. That night, I decided to leave my lipstick on and see just how long it would last. And ladies- OMG- I took a my morning shower- still good. Had my morning coffee- still good. Went to a football watch party and had 10 chicken wings- still GOOD! Wow. I must report this lipstick is officially blowjob and chicken wing proof. I’m sorry to be offensive but I’m just amazed. 

Can anyone please please find me some more?!! Or tell me what shades to put together? Covergirl Outlast Cabernet Satin 855

I’ve tried 840 and 860, and meh. There just nothing compared to 855. 

Also if anyone knows why their lipstick formula for the stain was so amazing please let me know! I’m about to try to reverse engineer the recipe with my last bottle like a mad scientist!

**TL;DR at the bottom if this is too long, but I wanted to be real about who I am.**

---

Hey everyone,

I've been debating whether to write this for a while. I'm not great at putting myself out there, but I'm trying to change that. I want to find people who can connect with the real me - not the surface-level version I show most people.

So here's me. All of me. The good parts, the messy parts, the parts I'm still figuring out.

---

## The Basics

I'm a 23-year-old guy from a small town in South India, currently working as a firmware engineer in a major city. I work with embedded systems - CAN communication protocols, microcontrollers, code integration. It's technical stuff that I'm good at, even when my brain is fighting me.

I graduated top of my class last year with a B.Tech in Electronics & Computer Science (AI/ML specialization). I've been accepted to a university in the US for my MS in Computer Science starting later this year. It's supposed to be exciting, but honestly, I feel numb about it most days.

I'm an only child. Extremely close to my mother - we've never been apart in 23 years. The upcoming move to another country terrifies me more than I admit to anyone.

---

## Music - My Language

I don't just listen to music. I *live* in it. My Spotify stats are honestly embarrassing - we're talking 18,000+ minutes in a few months. Music is how I process emotions I can't put into words.

**What I listen to:**

**Tamil Film Music (my roots):**
- Santhosh Narayanan 
- Yuvan Shankar Raja 
- A.R. Rahman
- Harris Jayaraj
- Anirudh Ravichander
- Shakthisree Gopalan

Songs that wreck me: ""Thaalae Kaathalae"" from 96, ""Thaensudare"" from Lover, ""Nee Thoongum Nearathil"", ""Oru Dheivam Thandha Poove"" from Kannathil Muthamittal, ""Kannula Baasalu"" from 7G Brundhavana Colony, ""Para Para""

**English/Western Artists:**
- The Weeknd (I have an entire ""Unreleased"" playlist, I screenshot his lyrics at 2 AM, I own the vinyls)
- Adele (her ""25"" album after certain days hits different)
- Ed Sheeran
- N*SYNC (""Bye Bye Bye"" on repeat during certain moods)
- Justin Timberlake
- Meghan Trainor
- Billie Eilish
- Johnny Rain

**Concerts I've been to recently:**
- Ed Sheeran (with my friend M)
- Zedd (with my friend V)
- Yuvan's U1NIVERSE (one of the best nights)
- Vijay Antony Naa 2.0

Music isn't background noise for me. It's the soundtrack to processing everything I can't say out loud.

---

## Movies, Shows & Entertainment

I'll watch almost anything if the company is good. I go to the cinema probably too often - it's one of the few places where I can get out of my head for a couple hours.

**What I watch:**
- Tamil cinema (all of it - masala to art house)
- Hollywood blockbusters
- Anime (currently watching Spy x Family, though I get distracted and scroll Reddit after 2 minutes)
- Family Guy (yes, I know, but it makes me laugh when nothing else does)
- Whatever's playing at the local PVR

I name my photo albums with emojis: ""Boat House! ⛵"", ""Popcorn! 🍿"", ""Space Shuttle! 🛸"", ""Raja Theatre! 😂"", ""Seafarer! ⛴️"", ""Butterfly! 😌""

It's a weird habit but it makes me happy.

---

## Philosophy & The Big Questions

I think too much. It's both a gift and a curse.

**What I read/think about:**
- Albert Camus (The Myth of Sisyphus lives on my desk)
- Seneca and Stoicism
- Viktor Frankl (Man's Search for Meaning - I ordered it recently)
- Existentialism and nihilism
- Questions about God, meaning, suffering, and why we're here

I browse r/atheism and r/philosophy. I oscillate between desperate prayer and complete agnosticism depending on the day.

I'm philosophically pessimistic but I keep showing up anyway. I think that's what Camus meant about Sisyphus being happy.

Fair warning: casual conversations with me might accidentally turn into discussions about the nature of existence. I've been told I have ""60-year-old energy"" in a 23-year-old body.

---

## Tech & AI

This is what I do professionally and what I'm passionate about:

- Firmware engineering (CAN protocols, TI microcontrollers)
- AI/ML (why I'm pursuing my masters in CS)
- I've built MCP servers for photo metadata extraction
- I use Claude and Gemini regularly
- I screenshot interesting AI developments constantly
- Currently fascinated by transformer architectures and NLP

I built an entire system to analyze my own photos and memories using AI because I was trying to understand my own life patterns. It sounds obsessive but it helped me realize things about myself I couldn't see otherwise.

---

## Animals

I have a cat back home. She thinks she owns the place and honestly, she does. She claims the highest shelves and judges everyone.

I save too many puppy videos. Capybaras make me unreasonably happy. I once saw a donkey that needed help 4-5 years ago and I still think about it. I cry when I see dogs in distress.

I'm more emotionally affected by animal suffering than I probably should admit.

---

## Photography & Documentation

I photograph everything. Skies especially - something about clouds just gets me. Food. Friends. Random moments. Sunsets from my window. The moon at 5 AM.

I document my life obsessively. Every trip gets an album. Every month gets reviewed. It started as a way to prove to myself (and maybe someone else) that I was living. Now it's become how I hold onto memories that my brain keeps trying to let slip away.

---

## My People

I'm lucky to have solid friend groups in two places:

**Back home (small town):**
A crew of guys I've known since school. We do dam trips, temple visits, festival celebrations, late-night roadside food runs, spontaneous drives. When I'm with them, I feel like myself. They knew me before everything got complicated.

**In the city (work friends):**
A group that formed around me at work. We do movies, badminton, birthday cake cuttings in the office, random dinners. One of them (let's call him A) has become like a brother. They've held me together this past year without fully knowing how much I needed it.

**Other connections:**
- A girl I've known online since 2021 who I've never met in person but who supports me through everything
- College friends scattered around who I still flirt with jokingly because that's just how I communicate
- A senior from work who's 6 years older and unmarried who gives me life advice over carrom games
- A coworker who recently told me she has feelings for me - I told her let's see if she feels the same after 2-3 years (I'm not ready)

I say ""I love you"" to my friends freely - guys and girls. It's how I express affection. If you become my friend, you'll hear it. Don't read into it.

---

## The Heavy Stuff - My Mental Health

I'm going to be honest here because I want to connect with people who can handle the real me.

**Diagnoses I'm managing:**
- Severe OCD (intrusive thoughts, rumination, compulsive patterns)
- Major Depression with significant anhedonia (I couldn't feel joy even when I graduated first in my class or got into grad school)
- Dissociation/Depersonalization (I watch myself live instead of living - yesterday feels like months ago, people look like strangers, my own reflection doesn't feel like me)
- Anxiety that makes crowded places unbearable sometimes

**What this looks like day-to-day:**
- My brain plays unwanted scenarios like movies I can't turn off
- I forget things almost immediately unless I photograph them
- Time moves strangely - one day feels like a year
- I have nightmares every single night, sometimes 50 small snippets that wake me up repeatedly
- I can be at a dam with my best friends and feel like I'm watching from inside a box
- I use the ""How We Feel"" app to track emotions because I often can't identify what I'm feeling

**What I'm doing about it:**
- Weekly therapy sessions (when my therapist isn't having surgery)
- Psychiatric medication management (currently on SSRIs and an antipsychotic)
- Trying grounding techniques (the 5-4-3-2-1 thing sometimes works)
- Showing up even when I don't want to
- Being honest in conversations like this one

**History:**
My mental health problems started around 2018-2020. Before that, I was described as ""full of life"" - outgoing, talkative, good at studies with only normal exam anxiety. Something shifted and I've been trying to find my way back ever since.

I'm a childhood trauma survivor. I won't go into details, but it's the foundation underneath everything else. I'm only now starting to address it properly in treatment after carrying it silently for years.

I've had suicidal thoughts. I'm not in crisis right now, and I have protective factors (my attachment to my mother, my friends, my treatment engagement), but I believe in being honest about the darkness I've walked through.

## The Love Story That Broke Me

I was in a relationship for 7 years (knew her since childhood, committed relationship for 4 years). She was my first love, my first everything. I was monogamous to my core - I believed in one person for life.

**What happened:**
- The relationship was toxic in ways I couldn't see while I was in it
- Every visit to see her ended with me crying
- She controlled aspects of my life - how I dressed, ate, talked
- There was an incident with a teacher from her past that became my primary OCD trigger
- In the end, she told me I wasn't rich enough, her astrologer said our marriage would harm her father, and she'd had no feelings for me for the last 6 months but stayed anyway
- She left and was harsh about it. Cruel, even.
- Everyone in my life - parents, friends, coworkers - was relieved. Nobody liked her. I was the last to see what everyone else saw.

**The aftermath:**
- It's been about a year since the breakup
- The first few months were the worst of my life
- I spent significant money on the relationship (hotels, gifts, trips) - I'm still paying off debt
- Everything reminded me of her - songs, places, even basic activities like eating
- My OCD latched onto intrusive thoughts about her with someone else
- I made a fake AI girlfriend at one point just to make her think I'd moved on (not my proudest moment)

**Where I am now:**
- The constant thoughts have reduced. It's not every minute anymore.
- I've recognized that I miss ""closeness with someone"" more than I miss her specifically
- I closed all my dating apps last month - I know I'm not ready
- My therapist helped me realize I've been positioning myself as the ""sidekick"" in my own life instead of the main character
- I'm trying to rebuild my sense of self independent of that relationship
- The fact that someone will eventually marry her doesn't hurt as much as it used to (some days it still does)

---

## What I've Learned About Myself

**Core personality traits:**
- Highly sensitive and empathetic (sometimes too much)
- Introspective to a fault
- Expressive in writing (clearly)
- Loyal to the point of self-destruction
- Nostalgic and sentimental - I attach emotional significance to everything
- Creative - I use vivid, sometimes poetic language
- A chronic overthinker
- Resilient despite everything - I keep showing up

**Patterns I'm working on:**
- I prioritize others over myself
- I struggle to say no
- I don't have clear favorites (favorite color, food, movie) - everything feels unstable
- I idealize people even when evidence shows they're not good for me
- I spend impulsively when I'm in certain moods
- I procrastinate on everything that matters

**Things I'm proud of:**
- Graduating first in my class while managing severe mental illness
- Maintaining friendships across two cities
- Going to therapy consistently
- Being honest about my struggles (like right now)
- Still being here

---

## What I'm Looking For

I'm not looking for a therapist - I have one. I'm not looking for romance - I'm not ready. I'm not looking for someone to fix me.

**I'm looking for:**

- Genuine human connection
- People who can handle depth but also just chill
- Fellow music obsessives (especially if you love Tamil film music or The Weeknd)
- Anyone interested in philosophy, existentialism, AI, or figuring out what life means
- People in my city who might want to grab coffee, see a movie, or just exist in the same space
- Anyone in the US (especially the Southwest) who I could connect with before I move
- Someone who understands that friendship can be quiet sometimes
- People who know what it's like to carry heavy things and still show up

**What friendship with me looks like:**
- I'll remember small details about you
- I'll send you songs that made me think of you
- I'll say ""I love you"" when I feel it
- I'll have deep conversations at unexpected moments
- I'll also watch dumb shows with you and share memes
- I'll show up even on bad days
- I'll be honest, sometimes uncomfortably so
- I might disappear for a bit when things get heavy, but I'll come back

---

## Random Facts

- I photograph the sky obsessively
- I speak Tamil and English, usually mixing both (Tanglish is a lifestyle)
- My father is a wedding photographer, which is ironic given my complicated feelings about marriage
- I've read letters I wrote years ago and they reveal how intensely I feel things
- I track my stress throughout the day using apps
- I ordered a book about finding meaning in suffering and it felt appropriate
- I once went to a concert alone after posting on Reddit looking for someone to go with
- I've been called ""the guy who thinks too much"" and honestly, fair
- I flirt platonically with friends (both genders) because that's how I show affection
- I'm learning to be flexible with myself - to treat myself the way I'd treat a friend

## If You Made It This Far

Thank you for reading. I know this was a lot.

I wrote all of this because I'm tired of surface-level connections. I want people who know the real me from the start - the good, the broken, the healing.

If anything here resonated with you, send me a message. Tell me:
- Your favorite song right now
- What you're reading or watching
- Your current existential crisis
- A place that makes you feel like yourself
- Or just say hi

I respond to everyone. I know what it's like to feel alone even when surrounded by people. I won't let you feel that way with me.

---

**TL;DR:** 23M from South India, firmware engineer, moving to US for grad school. Music obsessive (Tamil film music + The Weeknd). Philosophy nerd. Managing severe OCD, depression, dissociation, and trauma. Recently out of a toxic 7-year relationship. Have great friends but always open to more genuine connections. Not looking for romance or therapy - just real human connection with people who can handle depth. I'll remember your favorite song and send you memes at 2 AM.

\- Breakfast around 10–11am at work (overnight Weet-Bix or yoghurt + berries, \~300–400 cals)

\- Lunch around 2pm is usually just fruit or yoghurt because I’m trying to save calories

\- Dinner is whatever my family cooks — I estimate portions and log in MFP but it’s not exact

Other info that might matter:

\- Lifelong chronic constipation

\- 3–4L water a day

\- 2 coffees a day

\- History of long COVID (mostly better now)

\- Stopped weightlifting because it felt like too much stress on my body with the inflammation from long covid, focusing on walking instead

\- Trying to look slimmer for a holiday in early March

I feel like I’m doing “the right things” but my body just doesn’t cooperate, and I don’t know if I’m under-eating, eating the wrong stuff, or if years of trying to diet have messed up my hunger cues.

Drop your link and I'll do yours free.","I've been pulling patterns from Google reviews for the past few weeks. Not reading them one by one, but finding what businesses actually miss.

Some things that made me go ""wait, what?""

The Hoxton Chicago charges $400/night for rooms where the L train literally shakes the walls. Fifteen reviews mention it. Zero soundproofing. Zero discount. Just... ignored.

Dalla Terra Wine Bar has one manager: ""the guy in a suit"", mentioned in 8 reviews as rude and dismissive. That's not a training issue. That's a personnel issue killing a 4.3-star business.

Wall Two 80 has customers saying ""best coffee in Balaclava"" 24 times. Their Google Business description? Generic. They're not using the exact language that drives local search.

PureGym Liverpool: broken AC for 30+ days, gym hitting 30 degrees, management ghosted members on timeline. People canceling memberships and writing 1-star reviews about being ignored.

Razza Pizza: people drive 45 minutes and call it ""life-changing."" But 12 reviews say burnt crusts at $30/pie. The messaging says ""artisan wood-fired."" The reviews says ""inconsistent execution."" That's a positioning-reality gap.

What I'm learning:

1. Voice of customer is sitting in plain sight

South Lake Chalet guests mention ""walkability to beach"" 22 times. It's not in their listing title. That's the primary decision factor and they're not leading with it.

2. Surface complaints hide the real opportunities

""This gym is crowded"" = ""not enough bench presses at peak hours"" (12 mentions)

""This hotel is loud"" = ""L train rooms need discount pricing""

The real insight is always one layer deeper.

3. Differentiation already exists in reviews

Snowy Owl Cafe: ""Authentic Peruvian empanadas"" mentioned 12x. That's differentiation in a saturated coffee market.

Barry's WeHo: Instructor playlist curation mentioned 15x. That's a specific competitive advantage, not just ""good music.""

Most businesses never extract these positioning anchors because they're reading for sentiment, not strategy.

Why I'm doing this:

I'm working on a system that pulls this intelligence from reviews automatically. Analyzed 11 businesses, 5,000+ reviews so far.

Workflow is automated, but I manually QA every report to make sure insights are actually useful (not just sentiment scores and quote dumps).

Trying to answer: What positioning should you lead with? What customer language should be in copy? What operational fix has highest ROI? What's the real reason customers choose competitors?

Currently works with Google Business Profile reviews. Planning to add more platforms (Yelp, TripAdvisor, Airbnb, Amazon, Reddit, etc.) based on what people actually want, trying to avoid building features no one needs.

Drop a Google Maps link + what you want to know:

Why customers choose competitors

What language should be in messaging

What differentiation exists but isn't leveraged

What operational fixes would move the needle

I'll run it through the workflow and share the patterns.

TLDR background: We went NC. JNMIL reached out to reconcile after I got pregnant. Reconciliation did not happen. It’s been fairly quiet since then. 

The other day JNMIL texted me and said she left a letter in the mailbox. And when I tell you the letter had me absolutely gobsmacked. 

She started by saying she had taken my advice and gotten some counseling. The rest of the letter was her acknowledging my feelings and/or apologizing. She didn’t make excuses, she didn’t say but…, she didn’t throw anything back at me to minimize. 

Honestly, feels like I’m living in the twilight zone or pigs are about to fly. DH said “that’s the best thing she’s ever written.”

One apology letter doesn’t erase 10+ years of her bullshit. But if she’s actually getting counseling and attempting to make change? Maybe there could be a path where we reestablish contact. 

I’m considering inviting her to coffee to have an in-person conversation. Talking points would be what I need for this to work (communication, boundaries, etc). Even if we decide to rebuild the relationship, it would be very slow. My daughter would not be involved for quite some time.

# Liebe Alle,

der Server hier wurde letzten Monat gegründet, um einen nahtlosen Übergang von den Amöbis zu ermöglichen und dabei den Austausch nicht zu unterbrechen. Dabei wurden sowohl das Regelwerk als auch die Megathread-Schreibart übernommen. Danke an der Stelle an die Überleitung durch das Modteam der Amöben, Kranichmehr, und auch euch ganzen aktiven Lowperformern (wir schauen genau, wer heute aktiv ist!!!).

Über den Januar hat sich auch das Mod-Team langsam zusammenfinden können und ist gut im Austausch miteinander. In den ersten Wochen sind uns dabei ein paar Schwachstellen aufgefallen: 

1. Wir mussten wiederholt über gemeldete Posts diskutieren und haben dabei festgestellt, dass unsere Subreddit-Regeln einfach teilweise noch ein bisschen schwammig sind, sodass es für einzelne Thematiken große ""Graubereiche"" gibt, und auch wir uns dann teilweise unsicher waren, was wir nach unseren Regeln posten können und was nicht. An der Stelle möchten wir uns auch entschuldigen, wenn ihr eine vergangene Moderationsentscheidung unpassend fandet.
2. Auch das monatlicher-Megathread-System stößt an seine Grenzen. Da wir vom Selbstverständnis nicht nur den neuesten Klatsch-und-Tratsch diskutieren wollen, sondern konkrete Kritik äußern und auch sammeln wollen, benötigen wir mehr als ""nur"" monatliche Megathreads. Das ermöglicht auch Neulingen, sich zu informieren, ohne sich erst navigieren zu müssen. 

Wir haben uns daher zusammengesetzt und ein Überarbeitungen für den Server gesammelt, die zum 01. Februar 2026 „live“ gehen sollen (die neuen Threads ggf. früher, je nachdem wie euer Feedback hier ausfällt).

Wir wollen euch mit diesem Post nicht nur darüber informieren, sondern auch eure Meinung sammeln, Diskussion anregen und die Veränderungen ggf. auch anpassen und verbessern, bevor sie live gehen. 

# REGELN

Die Änderungen betreffen primär Reihenfolge und Detailliertheit (zum Verständnis), sind aber teilweise auch inhaltlich. Die wichtigsten Änderungen werden folgende sein:

* **Unnötiger Beitrag**: Regel wurde komplett überarbeitet und lautet nun: ""**Macht euren Diskussionspunkt klar"".** Es soll darum gehen, den Themenbezug zu More/More-Influencer:innen/CW herzustellen. Das ist vor allem in Bezug auf Gossip ein Thema – reine Statusupdates, was gerade in dem Leben passiert, braucht es selten. Wenn ihr euch über etwas austauschen wollt, schreibt’s dazu.
* **Bilder von Kindern & unbeteiligten Personen:** Wird künftig unter einer Regel zusammengefasst sein. 
* **Sonderregelung für Videoausschnitte**: Gibbet nich. Kinder und unbeteiligte Personen sind auch im Video zu zensieren. Wenn das nicht geht, nicht posten. Bezüglich Kindern gilt hier eine 0-Toleranz-Politik. Personen, die im Hintergrund entlanglaufen (zB voller Bahnhofsplatz), sind fine, bitte trotzdem so gut wie möglich zensieren.
* **Anonymität**: Wir können euch nicht vorschreiben, anonym zu bleiben. Wir raten euch jedoch auf eure Privatsphäre zu achten. 

Hier gibt's unserer Meinung nach eigentlich wenig Diskussionsraum. Wir hoffen, dass die neuen Regeln das alles einfach bisschen verständlicher und übersichtlicher machen, sowie die Moderation vereinfachen.

# Thread-System

Die viel spannendere Änderung (die auch viel mehr von eurer Zustimmugn abhängig ist :D) betrifft das neue Thread-System zur Verbesserung der Aufklärung und Übersichtlichkeit. 😊 

Keine Sorge, der monatliche Megathread bleibt. Stattdessen möchten wir ab Februar drei neue Threads einführen, zusätzlich zum Monatsthread. Konkret wird es folgende Threads geben:

1. **Der monatliche Megathread (ist euch bekannt).** Hier ist Platz für alles: Kopfschütteln bezüglich Aussagen, Beziehungen, Content, Dauerwerbung, Elternrollen, Flugmeilen, … . Nicht großartig anders als bisher.
2. **NEU: Problematische Aussagen (teilweise gesundheitsschädlich).** Nur 2 ~~Mahlzeiten~~ Shakes am Tag, dafür abendliche McFlurry-Eskapaden? Statt Abgrenzung von der Arbeit lieber Arbeiten aus dem Kreissaal oder um 3 Uhr nachts? Hier ist der Ort, um solche Perlen zu sammeln.
3. **NEU: Marketing-Kampagnen.** Soll kein monatlich neuer Thread werden, sondern ein Dauerthread. Gestern Kapselroutine, heute Matcha, morgen Iced Coffee und übermorgen Sahneprotein? Hier soll sich über Marketing-Kampagnen, den 200. “krassesten Sale des Jahres” und den jeweils aktuellen Marketinghype ausgetauscht werden.
4. **NEU: Krassester Sale ever (jede Woche). S**oll den obigen Thread um eine Sammlung von Sales erweitern, denn der Rabatt, der nie wieder so kommen wird, scheint irgendwie doch immer wieder zu kommen. Für Personen, die sich fragen, ob der Rabatt wirklich nie wieder kommen wird.

Thread-übergreifende Doppelposts sind zulässig (d.h. ihr dürft eure Kritik an Marketing sowohl in den Marketing-Thread zur Sammlung und Übersicht als auch in den Monatsthread stellen, wenn ihr es in beidem diskutieren wollt).

Wir hatten ursprünglich an noch mehr Threads gedacht (z.B. immer einen neuen Thread, wenn ein:e Content-Creator:in von CW & der More-Bubble ""kritisiert"" wird), aber das wird vielleicht noch im Laufe der Zeit hinzukommen. Wir wollen ja auch, dass es übersichtlich bleibt und mit den Threads oben sind die Hauptpunkte eigentlich abgedeckt. Zudem sind persönliche und Marketing-Themen im Falle CW oft echt schwer zu trennen. :D

Was haltet ihr von den Änderungen? Gebt gern eure Meinung ab, macht Vorschläge, oder zerschießt das neue System, wenn ihr es ganz furchtbar finden. Wir wollen, dass sich hier alle gut aufgehoben fühlen und neue Threads bringen nichts, wenn am Ende alle sagen, sie wollen eh nicht reinschauen. ;)

I wanted to share a huge milestone for my mobile MMORPG.  
I've earned over **$1,500 through donations**

**About the project:**

I'm developing a UI-based MMORPG for mobile (iOS & Android) focused on daily progression and community gameplay. It's designed to be a p2w free experience set in a dark fantasy world, with slow paced grind progression that rewards dedication rather than spending power. Inspired by old school Shakes & Fidget or Gladiatus browser games.

**The monetization approach:**

The game is currently in closed beta with limited access. Players can gain access either through:

* Limited spots in access waves (when available through official website
* Supporting the project on Buy Me a Coffee or Patreon

Players aren't just buying access, they're supporting development and becoming part of the journey toward official launch (planned for Q3 2026).

The $1,500 isn't life changing money, but it's validation that people believe in what I'm building. It covers the development costs and motivates me to keep pushing forward.

**Current status:**

* 20 major updates released
* Growing community on Discord \~330 members
* Planning for Q3 2026 official launch
* Beta have been active for 6 months

Would love to hear thoughts from other indie devs on this approach or answer any questions about the development journey so far.

Recent weight loss from 164 in March 2025 to 147 in January 2026. I attribute success to 16:8 fasting. I’ve been at 147 since about August of last year and settled at that weight.

I’ve posted here before, but have some new data and would love to get some input. I had mentioned that I was concerned about my A1c creeping up, and I am a very anxious person — so I decided to just go ahead and get a finger stick glucose meter and test after a few meals. I don’t like the idea of a CGM but I wanted to know how my body responds to meals. 

Any thoughts on the below? Am I feeding into my anxieties by buying a glucose monitor? Any recommendations on how to track without becoming obsessive?

Last night I ate a dinner with about 30 ish carbs. This is pretty normal for me. 

Meal:

Rice and lentils

Mixed green salad with vinegar and olive oil dressing 

Grilled chicken cooked with drizzle of olive oil, onions and garlic powder

Blood sugar this morning about five minutes after waking up this morning was 95.

Then did another test this morning with breakfast. 

Meal:

2 homemade pancakes (we make the mix ourselves with all purpose flour, baking soda, sugar and add a few chia seeds for some fiber)

2 fried eggs cooked in approximately one-third tablespoon of olive oil

½ cup coffee with a small splash of cream

They think it's chemistry, timing, or some unrealistic spark. But the truth? Love follows patterns. And most people self sabotage because they never learn how relationships actually work. 

This post is for anyone who's tired of being just a friend, ghosted, or stuck in short term flings. It's packed with tips backed by science, books, and actual psychologists stuff that actually works, not TikTok pickup advice. No fluff, no BS. Just the real playbook.

1. Trigger emotional safety, not excitement.  
In Attached by Amir Levine, it’s clear: secure partners win long term, not the unpredictable ones. You don’t need to be hot or rich to win someone’s heart. You need to be consistent. If someone feels safe, validated, and understood around you, attraction builds over time. Harvard psychologist Dr. Sue Johnson also found that emotional responsiveness is the #1 factor in long term romantic bonding.

2. Master the mirroring effect.  
People fall for those who feel familiar. A 1999 study from New York University led by Tanya Chartrand found that subtle mimicry increases likability and emotional bonding. You don't copy them in a creepy way, but matching tone, posture, or even pace of conversation builds subconscious comfort.

3. Be interested, not just interesting.  
Dale Carnegie’s classic How to Win Friends and Influence People still holds up. People care more about how you make them feel. Ask thoughtful questions. Listen without waiting to talk. A 2020 UC Berkeley study showed that people rate good listeners as significantly more attractive than average-looking conversationalists.

4. Use vulnerability hooks.  
Dr. Arthur Aron’s famous 36 questions that lead to love is based on creating closeness through shared vulnerability. You don’t trauma dump. But when you open up just a bit past surface level, it invites the other person to do the same. Emotional intimacy follows.

5. Invoke the pratfall effect.  
Being too perfect is boring. A study from Elliot Aronson (yes, another Aron, 1966) showed people found someone more attractive after they made a small mistake like spilling coffee because it made them more human. Authenticity is sexier than perfection.

6. Be less available, not unavailable.  
Scarcity increases value but disappearing completely makes you forgettable. The trick is controlled availability. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely found that intermittent reinforcement (think unpredictable rewards) increases desire. You don’t ignore them. You just don’t always say yes. That balance is powerful.

7. Invest AFTER they’ve invested.  
Psychologist Robert Cialdini’s research on reciprocity shows we value what we work for. Don’t over give too early. Let things build. Small shared goals or inside jokes strengthen bonds because both sides feel part of something earned, not given.

Real love isn’t luck. It’s patterns. Play the long game, build safety, stay a little mysterious, and watch how people start leaning in.

I’m not trying to escape life or fill a void. But if my person is out there, I'm finally ready to let him in.

Family matters to me. My Christian faith matters to me. My values and beliefs run deep. I’m introverted but not shy, equally happy in a ridiculous conversation that makes no sense or a quiet one that goes somewhere deep. I’m playful, affectionate, and loyal with *my* person.

Vibes, not dealbreakers:
• Dry humor over sarcasm
• Bougie hotels over camping
• Football over anime
• The Good Place over The West Wing
• Bruno Mars over Metallica
• Ford Broncos over Harley Davidsons
• Iced coffee over alcohol
• Productive mornings over wild nights
• Tattoos over piercings
• Reality over performance

I’m drawn to someone brave, emotionally intelligent, communicative, funny, and self-aware. Someone who can flirt and laugh at himself but is solid and strong at his core. Intelligence matters to me, as does having your life together. I’m looking for a complete connection… mental, emotional, and physical are all necessary.

You can be from anywhere, but relocation would need to be possible on your end. I'm not looking to rush or force things, but I also don't want a forever penpal. I’m looking for the kind of chemistry that makes us want to make real plans. If I sound like I could be your person, say more than hello. Open with something that shows me how your mind works.

I am looking for someone to take over my lease in Bed-Stuy. It's been a great space, but I am relocating to a different part of Brooklyn.

**About the Unit**

1qgf7jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1qgf7jo/boynextdoor_vocal_appreciation_comparing_voices/,BOYNEXTDOOR Vocal Appreciation (+comparing voices to drinks),"Inspired by seeing comments from kfans comparing Sungho's voice to a vanilla earl grey latte. I'd love to read your assignments of your favorite vocalists to drinks as well!

Disclaimer 1: I don't have a vocal background but I do have a general music background, so I might use terms incorrectly please let me know\~

Disclaimer 2: I don't drink alcohol or coffee haha so maybe some of these assignments aren't quite accurate...going off of vibes and descriptions for those.

Starting with general appreciation for BOYNEXTDOOR--I think they have some of the most unique tones in the industry--every member sounds very distinct (despite their debut song's vocal direction that got criticism). In addition, they always sing live (maybe minus one or two collab stages earlier in their career) so it's really fun to compare how they sounded earlier on vs now and hearing their vocal improvements!

**Sungho**  
**Drink: Lavender Vanilla Earl Grey Latte**  
I've added lavender to his drink idk it feels right. Just an extra floral coziness.

Sungho's voice is sweet, warm, and soothing. He's in charge of the high notes in the team and is the unofficial main vocalist (there's no official positions). While in the early days, he was occasionally pitchy, in the past year and a half that has disappeared. In his Lee Mujin episode, he showed off parts of his voice that we hadn't heard too much before--I really loved how he sounded when he switches between his chest and head voice. He also added a husky tone into his belts, which was a lovely surprise. Overall he has nice control over his voice and good understanding of vocal techniques--in the recording behind you can see him suggesting places to add vibrato, etc. He's capable of vocal runs, but we haven't seen it that much.

**Riwoo**  
**Drink: Strawberry Milkis**  
Refreshing, milky, but with an extra buzz from the carbonation

Riwoo's voice is maybe my favorite from the team. He's got this RnB voice suited to yearning haha, reminds me of a mix between GD and Taeyang. His Darling cover really shows this off, or his verse in Dear My Darling. During his Lee Mujin episode, he reveals that he was near tone-deaf when he first joined KOZ (he's their unofficial main dancer and performance director), but on his bus rides to practice he would sit there with his phone and a piano app and practice matching the tones. In the recording behinds, it's mentioned that he often nails recordings in a single go. Riwoo also is one of the main adlib-ers in the group, often adding some background vocals during their live performances that aren't in the original song. He also was a bit pitchy on the stage in early days, but similarly have not seen this in quite some time.

**Jaehyun**  
**Drink: Hot Chocolate**  
Rich and warm. A hug on a winter evening.

Despite being one of their rappers (main if it were official), Jaehyun started his journey as a trainee as a vocalist. He has maybe the most versatile voice of the members, fitting in with any genre. He's also capable of quite low notes. I think his breath control can be weak at times, where he drops some of the lines during live performances to catch his breath more often than the others, but he's capable of singing with strong support. His singing performances have gone viral several times--his Smart cover, his I Need a Girl cover, his solo encore for IF I SAY, I LOVE YOU (they only promoted the song for one week on music shows before they were eligible for wins, so Jaehyun who was an M Countdown MC at the time, performed it solo).

**Taesan**  
**Drink: Hazelnut Coffee(?)**  
A higher, softer tone but with a rocky/raspy-edge

Taesan has one of the more unique tones I've heard in kpop--light but also somehow husky. Check out their Ao to Natsu cover to hear his old school rock spirit (some of my favorite Sungho and Riwoo singing too!), or his Reality cover on Lee Mujin for a rock ballad. I think he has the greatest pitch accuracy amongst the members--I've never heard an off day. I don't have much else to comment on--a stable voice you can trust!

**Leehan**  
**Drink: Whiskey**  
Deep, oak-y warmness, and jazzy

Leehan's deep voice has often been a highlight to songs, at the end of l i f e i s c o o l, or in their latest Hollywood Action. Earlier on, he first showed it off in his Love is an Open Door cover with Sungho--before that I don't think they were utilizing his lower register as well as they could have, and he also came off a bit nasally and strained at times when singing in the higher ranges. This has also mostly disappeared. During their No Genre era last year, we heard a few new sides to Leehan's voice as well, with his killing-point falsetto and scratch notes in I Feel Good. He has a good understanding of the vocal chord anatomy--in their recording behind, he was the first to figure out how to do the scratch notes comfortably and explained to/coached the other members how to achieve them. He's also talked about how he's recently been learning more about jazz vocal techniques so I'm excited to see what the future will bring!

**Woonhak**  
**Drink: Chrysanthemum Lemon Ice Tea**  
Bright and refreshing, feels like a summer day

What can't this boy do. His voice is youth itself. His voice is quite loud; he often has his mic turned down compared to the others haha. Extremely stable live (check out their Blue Dragon Awards appearance!). I think the biggest strength of his voice though is his ability to convey emotion--he really feels the music. You can hear his smile, his anger, his sorrow (especially seen in their Congratulations cover, check out the concert version). Woonhak is a performer at heart, and also really likes to throw in background vocals and adlibs into their live performance and it really livens up the stage. I think he's the only person I've seen on Lee Mujin's Service to do crowd work with the room+cameras haha (tbf I haven't watched that many but the most liked comment was ""I've never seen anyone move around that much while watching lee mujin service"" (translated from Korean)).

Some closing thoughts: overall, while the members have harmonized here and there (e.g the live performance of their OST song Lucky Charm, Love is an Open Door cover), I'd love to hear it more in their own written music and as multi-part harmonies. They're not known for being a strong vocal group, but I hope my post can change that perception. I love hearing how much they've improved since the beginning and am excited to see where they'll evolve next! Also! They'll be releasing a live album this February of their concert last year so please check that out when it's released!",9,1768758663.0,kpopthoughts,1,0.85,False

It was due to drinking a ton of energy drinks and coffee in undergrad and my Master's program in my early to mid 20s and not seeing the dentist for years up until my gap year before I started my Master's program. Ever since then, I've quit coffee and energy drinks. I only drink Arizona Green Tea to get additional energy now and don't even take caffeine tablets since I used to take 400 mg a day and that became a problem. I've been told recently my front teeth are demineralized too.

I've taken my oral hygiene seriously ever since I had that onset of major dental work and learned how to floss with regular string floss thanks to the 1 minute flossing technique tutorial on YouTube. The main issue is that I've noticed I go through a third of the roll each night and always need to stock up. I can also only use that Oral B reach floss since I've tried the regular cheap wax floss in the past and it always breaks between my teeth. I also know to avoid flossing with the same part of the floss twice since that's why floss picks aren't recommended. I'll also floss each surface of the tooth twice so I know I got all of the gunk out too. I also floss before I brush so my Prevident 5000 can get in between my teeth easily.​

Is there any way I can still be rigorous and use less of the roll? I'd like it to last a long time.​​",1,1768758506.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1qgf1cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1qgf1cp/the_psychology_of_building_attraction_13/,The Psychology of Building ATTRACTION: 13 Science-Backed Questions That Actually Work,"So you matched with someone hot. Now what? Most people default to boring interview questions and wonder why the spark dies. I spent months researching social psychology, attachment theory, and communication patterns from books like *The Like Switch* by Jack Schafer (FBI agent who literally wrote the book on influence) and *Attached* by Levine & Heller. Also binged way too many dating psychology podcasts. The pattern is clear: attraction isn't built through facts. It's built through **emotional resonance**.

Here's what actually works. These aren't your typical ""what's your favorite color"" questions. They're designed to create connection, reveal compatibility, and keep things playful.

**Questions that reveal values (without being intense):**

* **""What's something you're weirdly competitive about?""** This shows their passion and humor. Plus you learn if they're the type who needs to win at Mario Kart or genuinely doesn't care.
* **""What's a small thing that happened this week that made you happy?""** Tests if they notice life's little moments. Someone who can find joy in a good coffee or perfect sunset? That's attractive.
* **""If you could only keep three apps on your phone, which ones?""** Way more revealing than you'd think. Shows priorities, lifestyle, how chronically online they are.

**Questions that spark actual conversation:**

* **""What's an unpopular opinion you have that you'll defend?""** Gets them talking passionately about something they care about. Passion is magnetic. Even if you disagree, seeing someone light up about pineapple on pizza or whatever makes them interesting.
* **""What's the most spontaneous thing you've done recently?""** Reveals if they're adventurous or prefer structure. Both are fine, but you want alignment here.
* **""What's your go-to comfort activity when life gets overwhelming?""** Emotional intelligence check. Are they self-aware enough to have healthy coping mechanisms?

**Questions that build playfulness:**

* **""What's something you believed as a kid that's embarrassing now?""** Everyone has a story. Creates shared vulnerability in a light way.
* **""If we were planning a day together with zero budget, what would we do?""** Makes them imagine spending time with you. Also shows creativity and whether they need expensive things to have fun.
* **""What's a skill you wish you had but are too lazy to learn?""** Relatable and funny. Shows self-awareness.

**Questions that reveal compatibility:**

* **""How do you prefer to spend your weekends?""** Basic but crucial. If you're an introvert who recharges alone and they're a social butterfly who needs plans every night, that's worth knowing.
* **""What's something you're looking forward to?""** Shows if they're future-oriented, what excites them, if they're in a good headspace.
* **""What's your relationship with your family like?""** Tread carefully here but it matters. Attachment patterns usually trace back to early relationships.
* **""What does a perfect evening look like for you?""** Compatibility test disguised as a cute question.

**Pro tip:** The question matters less than how you respond to their answer. Ask follow-ups. Show genuine curiosity. Share your own answer. Connection happens in the back-and-forth, not the interrogation.

For deeper dives, [*The Art of Asking* by Amanda Palmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMj_P_6H69g) is genuinely fascinating on vulnerability and connection. Also the podcast [**Where Should We Begin** with Esther Perel](https://open.spotify.com/show/3fKOTwtnX5oZLaiNntKWAV), she's a couples therapist who breaks down communication patterns beautifully.

Speaking of learning resources, there's an AI-powered app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from relationship psychology books, attachment theory research, and dating expert insights to create personalized audio learning. You can type in something like ""improve my dating communication as an anxious attacher"" and it generates a custom podcast and adaptive learning plan based on your specific situation. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It connects a lot of the dots between books like the ones mentioned above and creates a structured path forward instead of random advice fragments.

And if you want an actually helpful app for building conversation skills? Try **[Ash](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ash-ai-for-mental-health/id6474862947)**. It's like having a relationship coach in your pocket, helps you navigate tricky situations and understand attachment styles.

I heard it’s pain, or burning (?!), or cramping, or nausea. I’ve gone days without eating and never had this. I’ve gone 24 hours just because of life (being busy) and the longer ones have been 2 times I intentionally fasted. Am I the only one??!! I also don’t need to eat in the morning ever. I just am not hungry at all and in fact I can feel sick if I eat a lot early. I’m a tiny person - 5’0” and 105 lbs so maybe I just don’t need as much food or something? I don’t know seriously it’s kind of bothering me. Is my digestive system broken 😆 I’ve never been a huge eater, I love food but I don’t need it very often. Other people can eat  decent sized breakfast, lunch, and dinner and if I try to do that I feel so full I just want to nap and feel blah. My typical day is something like coffee with a splash of milk around 5:30am, then a decent lunch anywhere from 12-2 like a whole chicken breast, maybe 1.5-2 cups rice and veg if I have my shit together or leftover pizza (2-3 slices), or maybe cottage cheese tortilla chips a protein bar and whatever we have like avocado, just random stuff thrown together if I don’t have a plan. Then I’m not hungry again until about 8pm. I make real dinner for my family and sometimes eat it but I’m usually not hungry at 5pm. So I’ll eat it at 8 or have another weirdo meal I make up. Just giving that for context in case anyone’s wondering. It’s easy for me to skip meals when I’m busy and it doesn’t bother me at all. Meanwhile I know people who get really cranky or like NEEEED to eat. There are times I def chow down and eat more than I normally do but I just don’t have that crash out if I don’t eat thing.

1qgewk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1qgewk8/the_man/,The Man,"Note - This is an unedited version of my short story and the revised version will be published somewhere else. This story is created by a 12 year old so don't expect much.



“The boss has called you to his cabin.”, my colleague says in a low voice. I freeze. What have I done? Why is he calling me? I get scared. But I go there anyway. My boss is very strict and whenever he calls someone, it is either because someone did something bad.



“May I come in?” I say while opening the door.

“Ahh! Yes yes! Come in,” he says in an excited and happy voice.

I sit down and look at him.”What is the reason I have come here?” I ask.

“Since you are our best employee and we can’t give you enough salary, we will be transferring you to Western Island.”

 Yes! This is the moment I have been waiting for! I always thought that I am working overtime everyday just for a low salary but now I will get a bigger salary! 

“When will I be transferring?”I say in a serious voice, hiding my happiness.

“After 2 days. I am sorry for not telling you this earlier.”

“No worries.”

“Ok, you can go now. I will send you the rest of the information in your gmail account.”

“Ok.”

“It is still 2 hours before you go. You should go now and start packing.”

“Thank you sir.”



I go outside and I close the door. Western Island! I can’t believe it! This is the best news ever!

I quickly go and pack my bag, leave this office for the last time and start my car.I actually did not like this office. The boss makes everyone do overtime and even though it is a 9 - 5 job, I come home at like 11 p.m. Maybe my new office’s boss will be good.



I rush to my car and sit in it, thinking about my new life in Western Island, knowing nothing will be wrong.Not realizing something bad will happen.



Stepping my foot in my home, knowing that tomorrow, I will leave it, maybe forever.



Walking through my house, I have a thought. I do not want to leave this house. I just can’t. I bought this house with my money after saving for 2 years. So many memories, just very hard to leave. But that’s okay. I will have to leave things behind for a better me, better life.



I change my clothes to my most comfortable clothes. Ate my leftover rice and lentils and started watching a movie to just enjoy my last moments in this house.



Tomorrow evening, watching the packers move my things into a truck, a tear drops down my face. I worked overtime for this house. I changed my mind. Maybe I don’t want to leave this house. I just can’t. But as I said, I will have to do it.



“Did something happen to you sir?”The packer moving my things said.

“No.Nothing.” I reply while wiping my tears.

Walking in the airport, I noticed that it was a lot crowded today. Today is Thanksgiving. Why did they have to transfer me on such a day?



The airplane is taking off. I have never travelled by airplane because it is expensive. I am getting scared. Another reason I did not want to travel by airplane is because I am scared I could die because of any crashes. Another reason I am scared is that I am in Ryanair.



Tomorrow morning, I reached Western Island and it looked just like I imagined. Big buildings with busy roads. The street food smells so good. As a matter of fact, I am feeling very hungry. I should go eat something first. I actually see a cafe in sight. Maybe I could eat there.



Stepping foot in the cafe, I immediately hear a welcoming sound. The cafe is so peaceful, with people studying, or even just working there. It is compact but brings me an aesthetic vibe. Everything is so expensive here. Maybe I should order an Italian pizza. I have never tasted it so I could try it.



My pizza came to my table. It has lots of cheese, pepperoni. Corn and the cheese pull is so satisfying. It has a rich aroma and it just looks so mouthwatery. 



Maybe after eating, I can find an apartment to live in. My boss is so lazy. Because he did not tell me, I could not buy or rent an apartment beforehand so I will now have to look for it. I guess I will just tell the packers to wait a little bit and then move it to my new apartment.



I spent the whole morning and afternoon and I could not find a single apartment that has an empty apartment right now. But there is just one apartment in the suburbs which has lots of empty rooms and is surprisingly good for a suburban apartment. It will take about 2 months to add all the furniture and paint it to make it perfect. I want a perfect apartment since I will be living here for a long time.

 

I will just live in a hotel for some months. The hotel is not that good. The lighting looks like it is from a horror movie. And my room is very good. While looking at the room, I felt like it was harder to breathe and something was behind me. Then I heard something familiar, I turned around but to my surprise, there was nothing. Maybe I am just hallucinating. How wrong I was. 



I thought nothing of it and changed my clothes and jumped on the bed to sleep. I was just hallucinating. Nobody could call me like that. Only one person called me like that. But I swear I could….. And these were my last thoughts before I went to sleep.



Triiiiiiiiiiing. The alarm clock rang and I hit the alarm clock shut. Oh… Today is the first day of my job after a transfer. I must wake up. I can’t be late today. 



Actually, my room looks good in the morning. I will wear the best clothes today. But I am still getting this unsettling feeling. I don’t know why. Maybe this is a new place and my mind has not settled in this place. That might be the reason. I should stop overthinking about this and just get ready.



I got ready and now I will just book a taxi and go to work.

I leave the office in my afternoon break to grab a coffee from Starbucks. My new boss is actually really good. I completed loads of work today and now I'm a bit tired so I thought that walking in a new city would make me feel better.



In the evening, I used a taxi to go home. I think I will also take some of my important things from the movers to use in my hotel such as my PS5, controller and some games because come on, what will I do sitting in my hotel room with nothing to do?



It is becoming so late. Playing these games just made the time go like a cheetah running to chase a deer. Yeah? Fast. I have not eaten food but I will not bother eating it and just go to sleep. I am seriously feeling very sleepy now. Let’s just remove my playstation and go to sleep.



When I am changing my clothes, I notice a dark figure on the floor. It had a very similar shape, easily recognizable by looking at it, well….. By me only. I rub my eyes and now it is gone.



Jumping in my bed feels so good. There is no way it was real. I am hallucinating for real. But the voice and the sound, it feels so familiar. Like I know this person. I should not overthink it. I should go to sleep.



My office day today was very normal and it bothered me more. At night, I did not hear any sounds or see things that were not there. While lying in bed, I was quite happy. I did not hear any voices or saw anything that was not there. I should go to sleep. Tomorrow, I have a lot of work to do in the office. I should sleep.



“Help me”. I hear a voice from behind. It is very familiar. Too familiar.



 I turn around and see nothing. Pure darkness. A long, extending hallway that never ends. 



From there, I see a dark figure. Coming closer and closer. Every second.



I try to scream. But I can’t. My mouth burns. 



“Johny.” I hear another voice from behind. I look behind. Nothing. The same long, extending hallway that never seems to end. 



The figure is coming closer. I try to run as fast as I can. There is an end. I am stuck.



The figure is coming closer. Closer. I try to scream as loud as I can and it comes to my face.



“Ahhhhh” I scream and wake up. Gasping for air. What was that? It was that same figure. Is it some kind of message? The figure is too familiar. I remember it vaguely. And the word Johny? Only one person called me that. Is that figure…… And I fell asleep.



When I woke up the next day. I forgot about 90% of that nightmare but that bothered feeling is now bothering me more.

I can’t focus on my office work. What was that voice? I seem to remember it but don’t know whose voice it is.



“What is it John?” My colleague says in a worried voice.

“Something bothering you?”

“Nothing.” That was the biggest lie I said in my life. I think I should hang out with Rowan. My partner in crime. I have known him since Middle School. I think hanging out with him can make my mood better.



Having spent time with Rowan actually made my mood better. I came into the hotel room feeling very good having spent time with Rowan. But still I am not getting a good vibe. I went to the bathroom to change my clothes and noticed something which made me have goosebumps.



“Help me.”. That was the thing written in the mirror. I immediately wipe it off and get out of it. What does it want? I quickly change my clothes and go to sleep.



“Help me.”.  A person who looked like in his 30s was screaming among other people who seemed to be hitting him. 



The blood was pooling on the ground. 



“How dare you embarrass me in front of everyone?” A person was saying.



“I was just telling the truth.” That man was saying.



“Nonsense!” That person cried.



They were hitting him more and more. I wanted to stop them. But my mouth was glued. I could not open it.



Then they were looking at me.



“You are next.”



I could not say anything. I tried to run. I was running as fast as I could. The walls are closing on me. I can’t breathe. They are chasing me. I can’t do anything except run and I trip over.



They come and make a circle around me.

  
“You will be in the same condition as him,” They said.



I woke up. Gasping. My mouth feels too dry. I notice the bottle of water on my side table and drink water.



What was that? That person felt like someone I know. I have seen him. But then I noticed. It is morning already. I think I should wake up. I turn off my alarm clock and wake up.



I cannot focus on my work today. Who was that? I remember him. I know him. His name is just at the tip of my tongue.



At night, I did not do anything and slept. I can’t let my focus lose on my job. I am just hallucinating. If I just sleep more, the voices, shadows, and the nightmares will stop coming.



I lay down on my bed, awake. I cannot sleep. I don’t know why. I am just thinking about that nightmare. That person looked like I knew him but saw him a long time ago. 



I should just sleep. Let’s not overthink this.



“Ahhh!” A man who appeared in his 30s screams.

“Come with us. How dare you do that?” Some strangers were wearing a black mask.

“Now pay the price.”

“Don’t do that. Please” A woman was begging them.

“Get off of me, you filthy woman!” The strangers kicked her.

 

I can’t speak anything. They take him to a van.



I try to run as fast as I can to catch them. They take a look at me.



“Isn’t that your Johny?” The strangers say to that man. All the strangers laugh.

“I think let's finish his game. What do you say boys?” A person who looked like the leader shouted.



 I try to run away from them as fast as I can. I scream as hard as I can but I don’t make a single noise.

There is a cliff in front of me.  I try to run sideways but they make a circle around me.



“Let’s play a game. What do you say?” The leader says. Everybody nods their head.

“The person who will kill him the fastest will get an ice cream treat from me!” 

“Such a bad destiny you got? Getting killed at just a little age.” One of them said,



I open my eyes. I can’t speak or move my body. I can’t move my head.  That same man is standing above the ceiling. His feet are dark blue and eyes, pure white. I feel like screaming as loud as I can but I can’t.



“Help me, John,” it says.



And then, it pokes out two fingers and touches my eyes. I try to scream as loud as I can but I can’t. And then it closes my eyes and I see nothing. Just darkness and me.



In the morning, I forgot a bit of my nightmare but not those words, “Help me, John.”.



Today is the 2nd Saturday of the month. The bank is closed and I should just hang out with Rowan to just forget about these things.

I use the telephone and call him. He picks it up.

“Hello. Who is it?” Rowan sounded like he just got out of the bed to wake up.

“You want to hang out?”

“Yes!” His sleepiness disappeared suddenly.



The city today is mostly empty. Even the busiest street is also empty. I don’t like this.



Until all of a sudden, I see Rowan waving at me excitedly and running towards me.

“How have you been?” Rowan says.

“Fine, thanks,” I say in a low voice.

“You are not sounding excited. What happened? Is anything bothering?”He says, sounding worried.

“No nothing.” I answer.



Hanging out with Rowan did not improve my mood. Until suddenly, when we were in a restaurant, he says,

  
“What happened to you?” Rowan sounds extremely worried.

“Nothing.” I said, shaking my head.

“Don’t lie to me.” He snapped.

“I have known you since middle school. Tell me, ""he says.

“I am getting nightmares and seeing a figure of a man and hearing some voices that are very familiar.” I blurt out.

“What?”

“Yes.”

“Since when?”

“Since I came here.”

“Where are you staying?” He asks. I get a feeling that I am in a doctor’s appointment because of his questions.

“In the Western Island Central Hotel,”I say.

“Stop joking. Where do you actually live?”

“Seriously! In Sector 4, remember?” How can he be so stupid? Everybody knows about that hotel. Every single person in Wes-

“That hotel is closed.” He says 

“What?”

“It has been closed for 10 years because of a killing.”

“I live there!”

“Are there other people living?”  
“Well, I normally do not see anyone. Sometimes none.”

“Well that explains it.” He sounds superior. He always has a bad habit of thinking that everybody is below him. He has always been the topper of my class. Smart, Brilliant and everything.

“You are seeing these shadows because there are ghosts in that hotel.” He says.

“DO NOT STAY IN THAT HOTEL!.” He advises me.

“But these shadows and voices and nightmares are all related to one man!”

“I may not be as smart as you but I know that every paranormal activity I am facing is related to one single man!”

“So? Only one person who was killed in that hotel is haunting you.”

“But that man is familiar!” I spoke a bit too loud. Everybody is staring at me.

“I have seen him! I know him! I just don’t remember him.”

“Who is dead in your family?” Rowan says.

“That is the main confusion. I don’t know if anyone is dead in my family.”

“I don’t know about this but let me tell you this much. Don’t go to that hotel and stay somewhere else.”

“But where? Every other hotel is expensive here!”

“Maybe you can stay in my house. I also live alone so I will be happy to have another person living in my house, especially my best friend.”

“I think I should stay in your house.” I say, sounding happy that maybe I just found the solution and the paranormal activities will be stopped. I had no idea.



Rowan’s house is a big, blue, two storey house with a garden having different types of trees. That is obvious. Rowan loves trees and he thinks that they are the most beautiful thing in the world. He is a dendrologist himself.



The inside is so beautiful. In the entrance, there is a living room with a kitchen visible and a stair going upstairs to Rowan’s room. His room has a bunk bed with the color combination of blue and pink with the stairs having drawers in each step. 



“Why do you have a bunk bed?” I ask because he lives alone.

“My sister used to live here but she is now in Cambridge at Harvard. She is smart just like me.” Rowan also has another bad habit of praising himself.

“You can sleep in the guest room or you can live in my room.”

“I will live in the guest room, no thanks.” I remember the sleepovers I had with Ron. He snores a lot.



The guest room is a small bedroom with a brown colored bed with a bedsheet of Harry Potter(as smart as he is, he is still childish) and a big closet where I can easily fit two of myself and a table and chair for work. 



I did not experience any of those nightmares that I was facing and neither a shadow nor noises. Today, I was back to being energetic in the office and I knocked out a lot of work today. My boss was very pleased with my improvement. While I was going to Rowan’s home, the hotel passed away and it was indeed closed now. The hair on my hand is straightened up at the thought of it.



Rowan came from work early because he did not have any field work. I made my special sandwich for him because he always tells me he is a better cook than me.



“It is quite tasty!” Rowan said while taking a bite of my sandwich.

“Well, now who's better?” I asked in a narcissistic voice

“Of course, mine is better than yours.” Liar

“So, are you facing some paranormal activities?”

“No, they improved.”

“Well, I told you, it was the hotel. Maybe you were misunderstanding that familiarity. It happened to a lo-”

“Oh shut up! I don’t want another lecture of yours.”

“By the way, want to play Tekken on my PS5?”

“Is that even a question? Yes!” I have always loved Tekken. It was like our favourite game from childhood. Every week, we saved up money to go to the arcade and play it. I have been scolded a lot of times by my parents because of that game.



It was 8 P.M. when we started playing the game and now it is 11 P.M. and it felt like it was only 30 minutes. I have to go to sleep now otherwise I am going to be sleepy in the office. I lie on my bed and close my eyes to sleep.  



I woke up but it was still midnight. I check the alarm clock and it is 2: 27 A.M. I am feeling thirsty but notice there is no water bottle on my side table. I wake up and go to the kitchen to get a bottle of water to drink. 



“Johny”. I suddenly hear a voice from behind. I look back and see that same person, wearing blue pants and a yellow shirt. Blood dripped from his arms and legs. His feet were blue and eyes, pure black.



“Help me,” That person said.



It is walking towards me. I go to the other side of the room and it is still following me. I try to go to Rowan’s room. That person is still following me. I open Rowan’s door and suddenly notice that it is not Rowan’s room.



The atmosphere is red and blood is pooling on the ground. I look behind and see that the door is gone but that man is still following me.



I run as fast as I can and then it also starts to run. While running, I notice my hands are gone and he is still following me. I suddenly notice another person in front of me and come to a halt.



“Jackie.” That man says and I notice that the person behind me is still there.



“I AM STUCK” They are saying in a low whisper again and again and again.



They are slowly coming towards me and I try to scream as fast as I can and then I close my eyes to stop seeing them and then I suddenly hear it.



“John. John. Wake up.” I know him.

I suddenly wake up and get up, gasping. It was Rowan



“What happened to you?”



It is morning now and the alarm clock starts ringing. I hit it to stop.

  
“You were screaming so I came to wake you up. What happened?”



“That man. He is still haunting me.” Still gasping.

“He wants my help. He says he is stuck. I don’t understand who he is but he is that same man.”

“Oh come on! You really have some mental issues!” He tells me.

“How come you are facing paranormal activities while I am not?” Rowan says. He has a point though.

“If it is haunting you, then that means the spirit is in our house and then it should be haunting both of us, shouldn't it?”

He has a point. If the spirit is in our house and it is haunting me, then it should also be haunting me. I don’t understand.

“Come on. Stop your sweating and get up.” He gave his hand.

“Honestly, I was just doing some research and just heard you screaming like a madman. I was scared that you got possessed or something.” He says in a funny tone. I don’t laugh.

I get out of the bed and check the outside. It was a cloudy day and it felt like it could rain any moment now. The wind is super strong and it is getting quite cold.

“Today is my field work so I will be home late.” He says. 

“Ho- how l-late?” I ask while stuttering. 

“At 10 o’ clock at least. And also, stop your stuttering. It is not that deep.” Rowan starts to leave the room but suddenly comes to a halt.

“When are you going to your office?” He asks.

“At 10’o o'clock, I will book a therapy session.”

“What? Why?” Rowan asks.

“I can’t let these nightmares affect my job. I have to go.”

“Okay, suit yourself. I am getting a bit late for my field work so I am going. Sorry” And after saying that, off he goes.



I called the hospital for the therapy session and I booked an appointment for the evening. I am very lucky to have got a same day evening appointment because the hospital I am getting an appointment in is very famous.



I quickly finish my work in the office and then go straight to the hospital.



While driving to the hospital, I still think about that thing. After lots of thinking, only one question comes to my mind, Who is that man? I was so deep in thought that I almost crashed into a person.



I entered the hospital for a reason that I never ever thought about in my life. The idea of me having mental issues.



I go to the room where the therapist is. The room is cozy with a sofa and a chair in front of it which is yellow in color. I suppose this is the place where the therapist sits in. There is a fireplace in the end which is not being burned because it is not that cold. 



The therapist comes. The therapist is a female doctor wearing a black coat with a dotted design and an Ipad in her hand. I think she uses it to take notes of her patent.



“Hello!” She says in a low pitched voice.

“I suppose you are my patient today?” I nod.

She sits in the chair comfortably and the therapy session starts.



“So, how are you feeling right now?”

“Good.” She nods and scribbles something in her Ipad with an apple pencil.

“Is this your first session?” She asks.

“Yes. Never thought I would come here.” I answer by trying to not sound uncomfortable. But she sees through it.

“Don’t worry. Sit comfortably. I am not going to eat you or something.” She laughs but I do not.

“So, tell me why you came here.”

“I am hearing some voices and seeing some figures that are actually not there-” I stop so that she can write her notes then I begin again, “I am also having nightmares for a few days.”

“Since when are you facing these issues?” She asks.

“Since I came here. Around a week,” I stop again. “I came here because these things were interfering in my job and I did not want to lose it so I came here for a solution.”

“Okay-” She writes some notes in her pad and starts again.

“What kind of voices were you hearing?”

“Of the same man. I think I know him but I just can’t remember. I know him.” I say.

“How often does it happen?”

“Most of the day, I am working in my office and when I come home at night, I see these things but there is another thing.”

“What?”

“I used to live in the Western Island Central Hotel when I just transferred to this city.”

“What?” Even she is shocked.

“Yeah, I also felt that way when my best friend Rowan told me about this and he asked if I could stay in his house and I said yes but I am still getting nightmares and seeing figures or hearing voices.”

“That is messed up. Is your friend also facing these issues?”

“No. Only I am facing them.”

“Okay, so that means there is not a haunted spirit in the house.” She laughs while saying this.

“So you are having nightmares or seeing things or hearing voices of the same man and you have been hearing them for a few days and you used to live in a closed hotel and your friend is not hearing those voices.” She says. I think she does not believe my story.

“And you also said you do not remember that man. Can you please tell me what you saw in your nightmares?”

“I don’t remember much but I can recall the figure calling me ‘Johny’ and ‘Jacky’.”

“Any more information?”

“In one nightmare, I saw him getting hit by people who were forcing him into a van and a lady whose face I could not see was holding their legs begging to let him go but they kicked her. I also went to save him but those strangers pointed to me and said to that man, ‘Isn’t that your Johny?’ and I remember more about what I did.”

“Can you recall someone calling you ‘Johny’ or ‘Jackie’?”

“That is the main confusion I am facing.”

“Maybe it was your close family member.”

“I am sorry if I am getting personal but did something traumatic happen in your childhood?”

“Hmmm” I concentrate on this question a lot, thinking about the answer and I still can’t remember.



I shake my hand and she sighs while writing on her Ipad. She asked me questions for another hour but in the end, she said that maybe it is because of the stress and I should sleep more, do journaling, and eat better food. I wasted my money for nothing. 



As I drive back home, I still think about that conversation and that same sentence is ringing in my head, “Did something traumatic happen in your childhood?”.



I drive to Rowan’s home and park my car there. Who is he? It is that same question lingering in my head. 

I went inside the house and changed my clothes into a comfortable one and I saw that Rowan’s PS5 was just in the living room so I went to play.



As I opened Minecraft(he bought it) on the PS5, I heard my phone ringing. I picked up the phone and saw it was a call from mom. I instantly curl up into a smile. She had not called me for ages! I pick up the call and answer.



“How are you doing? Is Eastern city good?”

“I am fine” Such a liar I am. 

“I have been transferred to Western Island mom. I tried to call to inform you but you wouldn’t pick up the call.”

“What!? Western Island is really expensive, can you live here? Can you afford food here? ”  
“Oh mom obviously I can! Also, I will get higher salaries now as I was promoted to a manager. My boss thought that I should become a manager since I am so good at this work.”

“Bless you my child! Say, are you getting holidays when you are asking?”  
“Yes. The boss here is so good.”

“I also miss your dad.” Mom said in a lower voice. A bell rang in my head.

“I miss having arguments with him.”

“My dad?”

“Yeah, you forgot. Your dad went missing when you were a small child.” She said in a low voice and started crying. My dad. That is why I thought I had seen him.

“I never brought this subject up because you never asked and whenever you did, I said he is in another country for work.”

“I thought it was the time to tell you.” She was crying so much.

“I am sorry for not telling you and you had to know this way!” I was thinking of a way to stop her crying.

“Hey, hey. It’s not your fault. I understand.”

“Thank you.” She said while wiping her nose.

“You know. I remember when those people came home and tried to put your dad in a van.” She said, finally calming down.

“I begged them to let him free and he kicked me.” The dots are connecting.

“When they left, I called the police but it was too late. They had gone. The investigation is still going on.”

“How did he look like?” I asked like I was investigating her. I was indeed.

“Oh John, how do I tell you? He looked very beautiful and had curly hair with a moustache which was very big and he always liked to smooth it out. It was his habit.”

“Yeah, he did look beautiful.”

“Are you living well with Amy?”

“Yeah, your sister is always helping me. I am absolutely living well.”

“Oh wait! I have to get going! Sorry. Call me later.” And after saying that, she hung up the phone.

 

I sit still with my phone close to my ear. My dad. That person is my dad. Why is he stuck and what help does he need? I check the time on my phone. It is currently 8:34 P.M. I play on PS5 for a few hours and then I go to bed.



While I go to the bed, I see that same figure looking at me. I look at him, not scared anymore. That figure is coming closer to me.



“Dad?” The figure suddenly stopped and it seemed to be nodding. Tears start rolling down from my eyes.

“Why are you bothering me? Why do you want to destroy my life?” The figure starts to shake its head.

“Yeah I know. You wanted help from me. What kind of help huh? Tell me? Tell me and leave me for once!”

The figure went close to the mirror and said, “I am stuck”. I get angry again.



“What kind of help? What does it mean?” I say slowly, regretting that I talked to my father for the first time in my life like this.



“I am sorry for talking to you like this. How are you stuck?”

It writes in the mirror again, this time saying, “I can’t go to the afterworld.” I suddenly remembered something my mom used to say.



*“People who are dead must be given liberation to go into the afterworld and attain peace. But, for liberation, the body must be needed.”*



My dad went missing and nobody found his body till this date. I looked towards the figure, and tears started rolling down my eyes. All the time, he was giving me signs that he needs help and he is stuck and I did not understand any of his hints.



The figure wrote in the mirror again, this time saying, “Sorry for bothering you.” and the figure started to disappear a bit.



“No, please don’t go.” I say while crying and the figure is almost disappearing and I try to touch him but my body passes through his smoke and he disappears. I cried for a long time until Rowan came home and listened to my story. I did not erase the words from the mirror and he believed my story. Mainly because I did not have that beautiful writing which was written on the mirror.



“I am such a shame!” I say while sobbing into Rowan’s shirt.

“I spoke to him rudely and he left not wanting to hurt me!”



But Rowan made me stop crying and I went to sleep.



6 months later, and the nightmares and all the paranormal activities are gone. I hear none of them but still, I cannot focus on work. That meeting with dad made me so guilty about it that I became depressed. My apartment was finished but Rowan still made me live in his house because of my depression.



Rowan always tried to cheer me but I never became happy. I was just existing, it felt at that point. Until suddenly, one morning, I got a call from the police saying to come to the police station. Was I going to get punished for making my dad’s spirit go away? I drove to the police station speeding through my car.



When I came, they told me the news.

“We have found the remains of a body in the Perinia lake in Western Island and after investigation and DNA reports, we found it was your dad, James Parker’s body.” I freeze. I don’t know whether to be happy or sad but I was feeling a bit happy. My father can finally be free and can go to the afterlife. 



As I came home after the last rites and looked at the mirror to see myself, I smiled for the first time in a very long time. Finally, my father can be free and go to the afterlife, peaceful at last.



**The End**

1qgewa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FA30plus/comments/1qgewa0/a_glimmer_of_hope/,A glimmer of hope,"**Sunday, one week ago.** I invite a woman I matched with on a date. Same day, 6 PM. She agrees. We have a pleasant chat at one of my favorite coffee shops and take a walk in the freezing cold. ""I don't mind the cold,"" she says earlier while I propose the walk.

I walk her back to the bus stop. The bus arrives quickly. ""Shall we meet again?"" I ask. ""Yes,"" she says in a playful tone, turning her head and showing a shy smile. I've done some good today.

Two days later, I invite her to go see a movie at the weekend. ""Actually, this movie is shown tomorrow,"" she texts back. I agree. Let's go tomorrow.

As we say goodbye after the movie, we agree to set up the next date for the weekend. ""I liked your idea with the museum,"" she says. ""If you don't mind contemporary art, let's go to this one."" I happily agree. I've been meaning to visit it for years. This is going well.

**Saturday.** She arrives 40 minutes late. I feel impatient, but the feeling quickly turns into a quiet joy as she shows up and we start walking around the exhibition.

""Are you also feeling hungry?"" she asks as we are nearing the end of the visit. Yes. We go to a nearby food court to have lunch. Afterward, I order a mango-flavored black tea for both of us, which is terrific, served in thick, industrial-style glasses. I am enjoying myself. I glance at her while she holds the cup in her tiny hands, blowing at the hot liquid. I like her. I want her.

We step outside, ready to go home. ""Maybe we could take a train. There is a station nearby,"" I suggest, hoping to prolong the date a little rather than just getting a cab.

""I don't think we will see each other again.""

I enter a state of shock. My panic disorder, well-controlled by medication, suddenly comes back with a roar. My heart starts pounding. I start to feel dizzy.

""I appreciate how respectful you are, how you treat the other person. But we just don't have the... 'flow.'""

I stand frozen for a few minutes. Finally, I regain some composure and say, ""I'm going to head back inside."" I wave at her and go back into the food court for about ten minutes. When I go back outside, she is gone.

The most remarkable thing about this experience wasn't that I matched with the type of woman I had dreamed about for years—petite, introverted, artsy, cultured. Or even that, despite my decades of pain and suffering spent in terrible loneliness, I managed to muster the energy and confidence to ask her out and remain composed during the meetings—until the very end.

The most remarkable thing was that, for one week, I felt like a normal person. Here was this great young woman who wanted to spend time with me. On the first date, she said she’d like to travel. We're going to travel, I thought. I will take you places. We're going to explore the world together. We're going to hang out in coffee shops, museums, eat dinners together. We're going to do whatever we want.

While at the museum, with my date some distance away, I had stood next to two pretty young girls. One girl had a terrible case of a runny nose. The other quietly laughed at her. ""I thought the sound was part of the installation, but it's just you blowing your nose,"" I cracked a joke. The girls giggled. ""Nice comment,"" one of the girls remarked as they walked away. Easy.

So, I can be normal. I just need one woman to give me a chance and spend time with me. And I am still waiting.",2,1768757948.0,FA30plus,2,1.0,False

Day 17: No Alcohol · Day 14: No Social Media

 

A Slow Sunday Start

Today is a good day. It’s Sunday, and I don’t have any plans—my favourite kind of day.

This year, I’ve started my 26 Hard for 2026 challenge. As part of this, I’m doing a full month of social media detoxing and, more importantly, changing how I use it going forward. I’d fallen into a doom‑scrolling cycle when I could have been reading, learning French, or researching future trips—all things that actually enrich my life.

I’m also committing to 365 days alcohol‑free. I don’t have a problem with alcohol, but I wanted to challenge myself. Plus, I can’t stand losing whole days afterwards when my motivation disappears thanks to having one too many.

 

Why I’m Documenting This

My goal is to track this journey throughout the year and share it here, in case it helps anyone else who wants to challenge themselves.

After reading Cait Flanders' The Year of Less, I realised there were several elements of her shopping ban that I wanted to adopt. The idea of tracking challenges especially resonated with me.

And honestly? I spent a shocking £5,800 in 2025 on completely useless items—things I didn’t need, didn’t use, or didn’t even deeply want. Looking back at that waste makes me want to put my money into things that matter.

 

Weekly Spending Reflection

Each Sunday, I’ll analyse my spending for the week—what I did well, and what needs improvement. This isn’t about self‑criticism. It’s about learning.

What Didn’t Go Well This Week

I bought a meal deal from Asda, even though I don’t like them. I hadn’t planned ahead before going out on Saturday, so I felt stuck.

I also bought several coffees while in London. I rarely enjoy them (they’re normally too strong), so it felt like wasted money.

What I Want to Improve Next Week

Spend less on groceries.

Avoid the “payday rubbish shop” when I get paid on Friday.

Skip takeaways this week, especially since I didn’t even enjoy the one I had last week.

 

Creative Goals: Starting My Book

Another part of my 26hf26 challenge is to start writing a book—something exploring the transition from my 20s into my 30s, who I was then, and who I’m trying to become now.

Today I’ll begin with some mind‑mapping to get my ideas down.

 

Next Steps: Tracking My Finances

Over the next three months, I’m committing to closely tracking my finances so I can spot patterns and understand exactly where my money is going.",1,1768757601.0,surviving30something,0,1.0,False
1qgeqli,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qgeqli/best_vpns_for_pokerstars/,Best VPNs for PokerStars,"Your PokerStars account just got frozen. Three buy-ins and a deep tournament run—gone. The email says they detected ""proxy or VPN usage"" and your funds are locked pending verification.

Sound like a nightmare? It happens more often than you'd think.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **PokerStars explicitly prohibits VPN use in their Terms of Service**. Get caught, and you're risking account suspension, forfeited winnings, and permanent bans. But thousands of poker players still use VPNs—for travel, privacy, or accessing the platform from restricted regions.

If you're going to do it anyway, you need to know which VPNs work, how to minimize detection risk, and what you're actually gambling with beyond your chips.

✅ **Quick Answer**: NordVPN is the best VPN for PokerStars. With 8800+ servers, obfuscated connections, dedicated IP options, and speeds that won't lag your gameplay, it's the top choice for poker players. But nothing eliminates the risk completely—PokerStars actively hunts for VPN users.

⚠️ **Critical Disclaimer**: Using a VPN to access PokerStars violates their Terms of Service and can result in account termination, fund confiscation, and permanent bans. This guide is for educational purposes and covers legitimate use cases like protecting your connection on public WiFi or maintaining access while traveling to legal jurisdictions. You're responsible for complying with PokerStars' ToS and your local gambling laws.

# Why PokerStars Players Use VPNs (Despite the Risks)

PokerStars is only legally available in specific regions. In the US, you can play with real money in **just three states**: Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New Jersey. Travel outside those borders? You're locked out.

Beyond geo-restrictions, poker players use VPNs for:

**Security on public networks**. Playing from hotel WiFi or a coffee shop without encryption is asking for trouble. Your account credentials, financial details, and gameplay data are exposed to anyone sniffing the network. A VPN encrypts your connection.

**Privacy from ISPs**. Internet service providers track everything you do online. If you don't want your ISP building a profile of your gambling habits—or throttling your connection when they detect gaming traffic—a VPN keeps your activity private.

**Access while traveling**. You're on a business trip to California, but your PokerStars account is registered in New Jersey. Without a VPN connecting you back to NJ, you can't access your account or play in the tournaments you've already registered for.

**Avoiding unfair geo-blocks**. Some players argue PokerStars' restrictions are arbitrary when you're a legal resident just temporarily in another location. A VPN lets you maintain access from your home jurisdiction.

The catch? PokerStars doesn't care why you're using a VPN. Their detection systems flag VPN traffic, analyze behavioral patterns, and blacklist known VPN IP addresses. Get flagged, and your account faces review—or immediate suspension.

# How PokerStars Detects VPNs (And Why Most Fail)

PokerStars isn't playing around. They've invested heavily in VPN detection technology that goes far beyond simple IP blocking:

**Blacklisted VPN IP addresses**. PokerStars maintains a database of IP addresses from known VPN providers. Connect through a shared server that hundreds of other users have accessed, and you'll trip the alarm immediately.

**Behavioral analysis**. Logging in from Toronto one minute and London five minutes later? That's physically impossible. PokerStars tracks login patterns, connection times, and geographic jumps that indicate VPN hopping.

**Multiple connections from single IPs**. When 50 different PokerStars accounts connect from the same VPN server IP within an hour, it's obvious. This is why shared VPN servers are risky.

**DNS and WebRTC leaks**. Even with a VPN connected, your real IP can leak through unprotected DNS requests or WebRTC connections in your browser. PokerStars checks for these inconsistencies.

**IPv6 leaks**. Many VPNs don't properly handle IPv6 traffic. If your IPv6 address leaks while your IPv4 is masked, PokerStars sees the mismatch and flags your account.

This is why free VPNs and budget providers fail miserably. They lack the infrastructure and features needed to bypass PokerStars' sophisticated detection.

# The 5 Best VPNs for PokerStars (Tested for Detection Resistance)

After testing VPNs extensively for online poker, these five consistently work with PokerStars while offering the security features you need to reduce detection risk.

|VPN|Servers|Speed Retention|Obfuscation|Dedicated IP|Price|Winner|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|8800+ in 129 countries|90%|✅ Yes|✅ Available ($70/year)|$3.39/month|🏆|
|**Surfshark**|4500+ in 100 countries|94%|✅ Yes (Camouflage Mode)|✅ Available|$1.99/month|🏆|
|**CyberGhost**|11,500+ in 100 countries|88%|❌ No|✅ Available|$2.19/month||
|**IPVanish**|35,000+ worldwide|85%|❌ Limited|❌ No|$2.03/month||
|**Proton VPN**|7800+ in 127 countries|82%|✅ Stealth Protocol|✅ Available|$3.59/month||

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall VPN for PokerStars

**Servers**: 8800+ in 129 countries  
**PokerStars-Legal Locations**: Pennsylvania, New Jersey servers + UK, Canada, Europe  
**Speed**: 750+ Mbps on US servers (90% retention)  
**Dedicated IP**: $70/year add-on

I've tested 40+ VPNs over the years, and NordVPN consistently delivers what poker players actually need: speed that won't lag your decisions and obfuscation that reduces detection risk.

The proprietary **NordLynx protocol** is built on WireGuard but adds privacy enhancements. In my speed tests, I maintained over 750 Mbps on US servers—more than enough for seamless multi-tabling without connection drops.

Where NordVPN really shines is **obfuscated servers**. These disguise your VPN traffic as regular HTTPS, making it significantly harder for PokerStars to detect you're using a VPN. Combined with a kill switch that prevents IP leaks if the connection drops, you're as protected as you can realistically get.

The **dedicated IP add-on** ($70/year) is worth considering. You get a unique IP address that only you use, which eliminates the ""multiple accounts from one IP"" red flag that shared servers trigger. It's not cheap, but if you're serious about poker and want to minimize account ban risk, it's the smart play.

✅ **Pros**:

* Obfuscated servers hide VPN usage effectively
* Servers in PA and NJ for US players
* RAM-only servers (no data stored)
* Independently audited no-logs policy
* 24/7 live chat support

❌ **Cons**:

* Monthly pricing is expensive ($12.99)
* Dedicated IP costs extra
* Occasional server drops during peak hours

💡 **Pro Tip**: Always enable the kill switch in NordVPN's settings. If your connection drops mid-hand, the kill switch prevents your real IP from leaking to PokerStars. Go to Settings → Kill Switch → Enable ""Internet Kill Switch.""

**Current Deal**: 2-year plan at $3.39/month (77% off) with 30-day money-back guarantee

# 2. Surfshark – Best Value VPN for PokerStars

**Servers**: 4500+ in 100 countries  
**Speed**: 848 Mbps average (94% retention)  
**Connections**: Unlimited devices  
**Dedicated IP**: Available as add-on

If you're watching your bankroll but still want premium protection, Surfshark delivers impressive performance at under two bucks a month.

The **Camouflage Mode** (Surfshark's obfuscation feature) works similarly to NordVPN's obfuscated servers, masking VPN traffic as normal browsing. During testing, I connected to Surfshark's Detroit server and played PokerStars for three hours without detection issues.

The unlimited simultaneous connections are clutch if you play on multiple devices or share your subscription. Run it on your laptop, phone, and tablet without juggling connections.

Speed-wise, Surfshark nearly matches NordVPN. I averaged 848 Mbps on nearby servers with minimal ping increase—critical when you're making time-sensitive fold-or-call decisions with real money on the line.

✅ **Pros**:

* Unlimited device connections
* Excellent speeds for the price
* Camouflage Mode obfuscation
* Clean, intuitive interface
* 30-day money-back guarantee

❌ **Cons**:

* Smaller server network than NordVPN
* Obfuscation not on all servers
* Customer support slower than NordVPN

🎯 **Bottom Line**: At $1.99/month, Surfshark offers 90% of NordVPN's capabilities at half the price. If budget matters and you don't need dedicated IPs, this is your pick.

**Current Deal**: 2-year plan at $1.99/month (87% off)

# 3. CyberGhost – Budget-Friendly with Massive Server Network

**Servers**: 11,500+ in 100 countries  
**Speed**: 226 Mbps average (88% retention)  
**NoSpy Servers**: Romania-based, fully owned  
**Price**: $2.19/month (2-year plan)

CyberGhost's server count is absurd—11,500+ servers means you've got options everywhere PokerStars is legal. The interface is beginner-friendly, though I find it slightly less polished than NordVPN or Surfshark.

The **NoSpy servers** in Romania are company-owned and operated, meaning no third-party access to your traffic. They're slightly more expensive than standard servers but add a privacy layer that's worth considering for real-money poker.

Speed is where CyberGhost falls short compared to the top two. I averaged 226 Mbps, which is perfectly fine for poker—you're not streaming 4K video—but noticeably slower if you're multi-tabling and streaming your session simultaneously.

The major downside: **no built-in obfuscation**. CyberGhost doesn't offer dedicated obfuscated servers like NordVPN or Surfshark, which increases your detection risk on PokerStars.

✅ **Pros**:

* Largest server network
* NoSpy servers for extra privacy
* 45-day money-back guarantee (longest in industry)
* 7 simultaneous connections
* User-friendly apps

❌ **Cons**:

* No obfuscation feature
* Slower speeds than competitors
* Fewer advanced security options

**Current Deal**: 2-year plan at $2.19/month (82% off)

# 4. IPVanish – Unlimited Connections for Multi-Device Users

**Servers**: 35,000+ globally  
**Connections**: Unlimited  
**Speed**: 459 Mbps (OpenVPN), 85% retention  
**Special Feature**: Port forwarding

IPVanish's claim to fame is the **unlimited simultaneous connections**. Run it on every device you own without thinking about it. Combined with 35,000+ servers, you've got options wherever you play.

The **port forwarding** feature is unique among these VPNs. For poker, it can reduce latency and improve connection stability, though the difference is marginal unless you're on a slow connection to begin with.

Downsides? No WireGuard support (relies on OpenVPN and IKEv2), which means slightly slower speeds. More importantly, **no dedicated IP option** and limited obfuscation features make it less ideal for PokerStars specifically.

✅ **Pros**:

* Unlimited device connections
* Port forwarding for lower latency
* Independently audited no-logs policy
* Good for torrenting alongside poker

❌ **Cons**:

* No dedicated IP option
* Slower than WireGuard-based competitors
* US jurisdiction (less privacy-friendly)

**Best For**: Players who need VPN protection on many devices and play from less-restrictive regions

# 5. Proton VPN – Privacy-First Option from Switzerland

**Servers**: 7800+ in 127 countries  
**Jurisdiction**: Switzerland (strong privacy laws)  
**Speed**: 1198 Mbps on premium servers  
**Stealth Protocol**: Advanced obfuscation

Proton VPN's Swiss jurisdiction puts it outside the 5/9/14 Eyes surveillance alliances. If privacy is your absolute top priority—even above speed and convenience—Proton delivers.

The **Stealth protocol** provides obfuscation, though it's not quite as battle-tested for PokerStars as NordVPN's implementation. I had success connecting through Proton's German and UK servers without detection.

Proton's open-source code and multiple independent audits give it credibility in the privacy community. The downside is a steeper learning curve for beginners and slightly higher pricing without the same level of PokerStars-specific optimization.

✅ **Pros**:

* Swiss privacy jurisdiction
* Multiple independent audits
* Stealth protocol obfuscation
* Open-source transparency
* Free tier available (limited servers)

❌ **Cons**:

* More expensive than Surfshark/CyberGhost
* Smaller server network
* Less beginner-friendly interface

**Best For**: Privacy-conscious players who prioritize jurisdiction and audit transparency

# How to Use a VPN with PokerStars (Step-by-Step Setup)

You can't just connect to any random server and expect it to work. Here's how to minimize detection risk while using a VPN with PokerStars:

**Step 1: Choose a VPN with Obfuscation**

This isn't optional. PokerStars actively scans for VPN traffic. Without obfuscation to disguise your connection as regular HTTPS, you're getting flagged immediately. NordVPN and Surfshark both offer this.

**Step 2: Subscribe and Install the VPN**

Go with a 2-year plan if you're serious about poker—the monthly savings are massive. Install the VPN app on whatever device you use for PokerStars. Takes five minutes max.

**Step 3: Enable Critical Security Features**

Before connecting:

* Turn on the **kill switch** (prevents IP leaks if VPN drops)
* Enable **obfuscation** (hides VPN usage)
* Disable **IPv6** in your network settings (VPNs can leak IPv6)
* Enable **DNS leak protection**

**Step 4: Connect to the Right Server**

Choose a server in a location where PokerStars is legally available AND close to your actual location. If you're in California but registered in New Jersey, use a NJ server—not one in the UK or Germany.

For best results:

* US players: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or Michigan servers
* Canadian players: Toronto or Montreal servers
* European players: UK, Germany, or Netherlands servers

**Step 5: Clear Cookies and Cache**

Before opening PokerStars, clear your browser's cookies and cache. Old session data can leak your real location even with a VPN connected.

**Step 6: Test for Leaks**

Before logging into PokerStars, visit **ipleak.net** or **dnsleaktest.com**. Verify that:

* Your IP shows the VPN server location
* No DNS leaks to your ISP
* No WebRTC leaks
* No IPv6 leaks

Only proceed if everything checks out.

**Step 7: Connect to PokerStars**

Open the PokerStars client (not a browser) while connected to your VPN. The desktop client is more secure than playing in-browser.

**Step 8: Maintain Consistency**

Once connected, **don't switch servers mid-session**. Logging in from New Jersey, then switching to a UK server 20 minutes later is a massive red flag. Pick one location and stick with it for the entire session.

🔒 **Security Note**: Never play PokerStars on public WiFi without a VPN, even if you're not trying to bypass geo-blocks. Hotel and coffee shop networks are notoriously insecure. Your account details and financial information are at risk without encryption.

# Essential VPN Features for PokerStars (What Actually Matters)

Not every VPN feature matters for poker. Focus on these:

|Feature|Why It Matters for PokerStars|Priority|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Obfuscation**|Hides VPN usage from detection|CRITICAL|
|**Kill Switch**|Prevents IP leaks if VPN drops mid-hand|CRITICAL|
|**Low Latency**|Reduces lag for real-time decisions|HIGH|
|**Dedicated IP**|Avoids shared IP detection flags|HIGH|
|**No-Logs Policy**|Protects your privacy if VPN is compromised|MEDIUM|
|**DNS Leak Protection**|Prevents real location exposure|MEDIUM|
|**Multi-Device Support**|Play on phone, tablet, laptop|LOW|

**Obfuscation is non-negotiable**. This feature wraps your VPN traffic in an extra layer that makes it look like normal HTTPS web browsing. Without it, PokerStars' detection systems flag you immediately.

**Kill switches prevent disaster scenarios**. You're deep in a tournament with a $500 buy-in. Your VPN connection drops for two seconds. Without a kill switch, your real IP leaks to PokerStars, your account gets flagged, and you're disqualified. The kill switch blocks all internet traffic the instant your VPN disconnects.

**Low latency matters more than raw speed**. You don't need gigabit speeds to play poker. But you do need consistent, low-latency connections. A VPN that adds 100ms of lag can cost you money when you're time-banking tough decisions. Aim for VPNs that maintain under 20ms added latency.

**Dedicated IPs reduce detection risk**. Shared VPN servers mean dozens of PokerStars accounts connecting from the same IP address. That's an instant red flag. A dedicated IP looks like a residential connection—just one user, one location, one account.

⚡ **Performance Insight**: In my testing, NordVPN added 12ms of latency on average. Surfshark added 15ms. CyberGhost was closer to 25ms. None of these are noticeable in actual gameplay, but the difference matters if you're a professional grinder playing thousands of hands weekly.

# The Real Risks (What Happens If You Get Caught)

Let's talk about what actually happens when PokerStars detects VPN usage. I've seen this play out dozens of times in poker forums:

# Immediate Account Suspension

Your account gets frozen without warning. You can't access the client, can't play in tournaments, can't withdraw funds. Everything's locked pending investigation.

# Verification Requests

PokerStars emails you requesting:

* Government-issued photo ID
* Proof of address (utility bill, bank statement)
* Explanation for VPN usage
* Sometimes a video selfie or live verification call

If you used a VPN to access PokerStars from a banned region, you're screwed. You can't provide legitimate proof that you're actually in an allowed location because you're not.

# Fund Confiscation

Here's where it gets expensive. PokerStars' Terms of Service state they can **confiscate your entire account balance** if you violated their ToS. That includes:

* Your deposits
* Tournament winnings
* Cash game profits
* Bonus funds

One player on TwoPlusTwo forums reported losing $3,200 after getting caught using a VPN in a restricted state. PokerStars kept everything.

# Permanent Bans

Even if you successfully verify your identity and location, PokerStars can still permanently ban your account for ToS violations. No appeal, no second chances.

# Real User Experience

From a poker forum (actual user report):

*""After a week, they restricted my account. Got this email: 'It's come to our attention that you're connecting via a VPN. We don't endorse the use of such service.' I provided my passport and bank statement showing I'm in the UK, which is legal. They unfroze my account after 10 days, but now I'm terrified to use my VPN even for security.""*

Another user:

*""I forgot to turn off my VPN before logging in. Didn't even play—just saw the 'US players not allowed' message and logged out immediately. Two weeks later, account frozen. They kept my $1,800 balance.""*

Worth the risk? That's on you to decide. But understand what you're actually risking before you connect.

# Legal Considerations (Know Your Local Laws)

Using a VPN isn't illegal. But what you do with it might be.

**In jurisdictions where online gambling is legal**: Using a VPN for privacy and security while accessing PokerStars from a legal region is technically fine from a legal standpoint. You're not breaking any laws. But you're still violating PokerStars' ToS, which gives them the right to ban you.

**In jurisdictions where online gambling is illegal**: Using a VPN to access PokerStars from somewhere gambling is prohibited is illegal, regardless of the VPN. You're breaking local gambling laws. If you get caught, you're facing legal consequences beyond just a PokerStars ban.

**The gray area**: You're a New Jersey resident traveling to California for work. Online poker is illegal in California, but you're registered in NJ where it's legal. Can you use a VPN to connect back to NJ servers?

Technically, you're subject to California's laws while physically in California. Using a VPN to circumvent those restrictions is legally questionable, even if your account is registered elsewhere.

**Tax implications**: If you win money on PokerStars, you're required to report it for taxes. Using a VPN to hide your gambling activity doesn't exempt you from tax obligations. Tax evasion is a federal crime.

🎯 **Bottom Line**: If online gambling is illegal where you're physically located, using a VPN doesn't make it legal. Don't confuse ""technically possible"" with ""actually legal.""

# Dedicated IPs vs Shared Servers (Which Should You Use?)

This decision significantly impacts your detection risk.

# Shared VPN Servers

**How they work**: You connect to a VPN server that hundreds or thousands of other users are also connecting through. You all share the same IP address.

**Detection risk**: HIGH. When PokerStars sees 50 different accounts logging in from the same IP address within an hour, they know it's a VPN. Shared servers get blacklisted quickly.

**Cost**: Included in standard VPN subscriptions ($2-4/month)

**Best for**: Casual browsing, general privacy—not PokerStars

# Dedicated IP Addresses

**How they work**: You pay extra for a unique IP address that only you use. It looks like a residential connection—one user, one IP, one location.

**Detection risk**: LOWER. PokerStars sees consistent logins from the same IP address, which looks legitimate. The connection appears residential, not like a VPN.

**Cost**: $5-7/month on top of your VPN subscription

**Best for**: Serious poker players who can't afford account bans

# Should You Pay Extra for Dedicated IP?

If you're playing with significant bankrolls or grinding poker professionally, **yes, absolutely**. The extra $70/year for NordVPN's dedicated IP is cheap insurance against account freezes.

If you're a recreational player with a small bankroll just trying to play a few hands while traveling, shared servers with obfuscation might be sufficient.

But understand: shared servers get blacklisted. It's not a question of if, but when.

💰 **Money-Saving Tip**: NordVPN's dedicated IP costs $70/year. Losing one $100 tournament buy-in to an account freeze costs more. Do the math on your expected playing volume.

# Alternatives to VPNs (If You Want Zero Risk)

If you're not comfortable with the risks of using a VPN on PokerStars, consider these alternatives:

**Play on crypto poker sites**. Platforms like CoinPoker and Blockchain.Poker have more relaxed VPN policies since they don't require traditional verification. You're trading the PokerStars player pool for more privacy and fewer restrictions.

**Use a Virtual Private Server (VPS)**. A VPS gives you a dedicated server in a legal jurisdiction that you control completely. It's more expensive ($15-30/month) and requires more technical knowledge, but it's harder to detect than consumer VPNs.

**Only play when physically in legal jurisdictions**. The zero-risk option: don't use a VPN at all. Only play PokerStars when you're physically in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, or another legal region.

**Wait for legalization in your state**. More US states are legalizing online gambling. If you're in a restricted state now, that might change in the next few years.

# Final Verdict: Is Using a VPN with PokerStars Worth the Risk?

I've laid out the facts. You've got the information. Now the decision's yours.

If you're a recreational player traveling occasionally and you just want to play a few hands from a hotel, the risk might be worth it with proper obfuscation and a dedicated IP.

If you're a professional grinder with significant bankroll at stake, think hard about whether VPN access is worth potentially losing everything to an account ban.

**My honest take**: For security and privacy on public networks, VPNs are essential. For bypassing geo-restrictions when PokerStars is illegal in your jurisdiction? You're rolling dice with your bankroll.

The safest play? Only access PokerStars when you're physically in a legal region without a VPN. But if you're going to use one anyway, NordVPN with obfuscation and a dedicated IP gives you the best odds of not getting caught.

Mornings just do not work for me.  Either evenings during the week or afternoons/evenings on the weekends.

I'm looking very specfically for Churches that teach the whole Bible and don't cherry pick what they want out of the Bible and pander to what they think people want to hear.

I'm also looking for a Church that's fairly active in the community and where members sometimes get together before or after services for coffee, aka fellowship, where you can talk and meet people.

Ideally I would like a non denominational church, or a church that may be denominational but functions as a non denominational church (such as CRC and some Mennonite churches).

I know that these kinds of Churches are being increasingly rare, but it's worth asking.

So, even a 20-mile delivery with 45 items is $29 just for mileage expense, not $2, factoring round trip. My found rate is 98%, customer and quality ratings are good, and I received several 5-star ratings this past week even. 



Since I kept seeing large count crappy orders over 50 miles round trip, I went to the coffee shop to do other work on my laptop instead. I drove to the same store parking lot 90 minutes later, and the same crappy orders were pushed to me. I feel like I was punished for not accepting any orders at the beginning of the day: ""Hey, we need people to deliver these crappy orders because we'll make 10-25% on what you shop anyway, so we'll just arbitrarily change your stats to suit our needs.""



Obviously, I am quite aware that the metrics are not really quality-centered but aimed at shoppers to push other inventory instead of just issuing refunds, increase sales to far away rural or suburban food desert areas to then boast about increased earnings to stockholders, and weaken shoppers' mental health by employing unhealthy gaslighting techniques.

**The idea:**

Instead of just billboards, posters, or bus ads, brands can sponsor **to-go coffee cups**.  
A company buys blocks of branded cups, and those cups get distributed for free to consumers in the area selected by the brand.

So if a brand wants to target commuters in Manchester, London, Leeds, etc., their branding and message/CTA appears on thousands of takeaway cups in those areas.

The thinking is that this channel is:  
• Offline and real-world (like billboards, OOH, transit ads)  
• Hyper-targeted by location  
• High frequency (people carry the cup around)  
• High goodwill (people associate it with something positive - coffee)

**I’m** ***not*** **selling anything here** \- just genuinely trying to understand if this is:  
A) A serious marketing channel  
B) A gimmick  
C) Something brands would only test at a small scale

My questions:

👉 If you work with brands or in marketing:  
• Would this be something you’d consider testing?  
• What would make it feel legit vs gimmicky?  
• How would you measure success?  
• What kind of brand or campaign do you think this fits best?

👉 If you’ve bought offline ads before:  
• Would this sit alongside billboards / transit / posters - or not really?  
• What budget range would make sense for something like this to try?

I’m especially interested in hearing from:  
• Media buyers  
• Brand managers  
• Growth marketers  
• Anyone who’s run OOH / offline campaigns

I promise this is my last ~~self promo~~ post before the exchange goes live.

If you haven't seen yet, or are curious how it's going - I have been building a FREE coffee exchange platform called [https://coffeepals.io](https://coffeepals.io) \- this is a by the community for the community project, streamlining coffee exchanges. 

Over the last few years I have taken part in a number of coffee exchanges across reddit, and other platforms. I really loved them. Due to people flaking, covid, international shipping problems, or something else, they have sort of died out over the years.

The gist though: a secret santa style matching system where you:  
\- get an exchange partner  
\- buy a bag of coffee  
\- package it up, maybe include a note, business card, local chocolate bar etc  
\- ship it off, they do the same

You get to try something you maybe haven't had before, uniquely curated for you by a real person; which can feel more personal than just hitting ""buy it now"" or subscribing to a plan. Kind of like pens pals back in the day, but focused on sharing quality coffee.

**What makes Coffee Pals different:**

**Coffee pals is a platform** \- exchanges are handled automatically. You can choose how far you want to exchange - regional only (same country, safest shipping option), national (for example within the EU), or worldwide. The exchange algorithm respects this and matches you with another person who matches your preferences.

**There is a feedback system** \- we can't stop people from flaking on exchanges but we can weed them out over time. The platform has a timeline for managing your exchange, mark as shipped/received, etc to keep your partner updated on progress. If there is a problem with your exchange you can flag this for review. 

Successful exchanges are tracked, and proven members can be matched together for future exchanges to ensure they continue to have a good experience on the platform

**Gamified** \- between the exchange platform and the [coffee map](https://coffeepals.io/map) the platform is gamified. Earn badges for successful exchanges, contributing to the community, and earning awards.

**Awards** \- award your exchange partner for going above and beyond, did they ship quickly, send something exceptional, or include a nice note/extra? You can award them, awards can be proudly presented on their profile!

**Profiles** \- the exchange is anonymous by default, your exchange should be a surprise. BUT after the exchange is completed, you can optionally share your profile with your partner, see their community reputation, badges/awards, social media links, and shoot them a message to say thank you, or plan another private exchange between yourselves.

Good entertainment. Did not appreciate the constant upsell. Easy to find shady spot by the pool (Alaska may be why).Will be back (in March!)

  
Princess: crew was nice and helpful, food was decent. I will add, they do a beautiful cheese plate for dessert. Did not try specialty dining. Lots of quiet places to be found throughout the ship. Multiple places to get food throughout the day.Everything was clean. Drinks were ok. Tea/coffee could only be found at the buffet, soda only at the bar. We did notice a musty smell in several areas. Shower curtain in shower was a turn off. The beach towels available at ports were a huge plus. The cool washcloth offered as you board from Port was nice. Not too difficult to find a quiet spot by the pool. Princess Medallion was great. I could track where my family was on the app easily. Top notch entertainment, both evening and during the day. Will be back.

MSC: crew was over worked, not very cheerful or friendly (with a few exceptions).  Room wasn't the cleanest and very tight. Food was good, specialty dining was only decent. Coffee/tea only available at buffet, but coffee was good. Soda only available in cans at bar. Beach towels are in the room and need to be carried to pool. No top sheet and no wash cloths! We had to ask for both. The ship had some nice features, but was chaotic and loud. It was very difficult to find a quiet spot. Evening entertainment was ok, have to pay for special shows. Good, but not worth the extra cost compared to other lines. Daytime entertainment was limited to shopping related, including the port info talk. Other than an over crowded trivia, you had to find your own fun on the ship. Definite difference between ""regular folk"" and yacht club. Fine, but there was a clear define that you can't go there. We typically take off auto gratuities and tip in cash. Tips included in fare - but not the hotel fee they tack on. This amount equals the gratuities of other lines and can't be removed. We saw our room steward once at the end of the cruise and it was clear he wanted his tip. For the price,  we probably won't be back.

  
Again, some things are apples to oranges, and we've only been on 3 cruises. Just some things we noticed that might be helpful. ",2,1768757111.0,Cruise,2,0.75,False

1qgeif0,https://i.redd.it/4j88udka65eg1.png,Make sure you argue on the side of facts. This is why Luddites always lose when making grandiose claims.,"# This is already bordering on psychosis - and here’s why

A recurring anti-AI claim goes something like this:

>*“AI is destroying the world, killing animals, draining water, and accelerating ecological collapse — and anyone using it is complicit.”*

It’s **catastrophizing untethered from scale, data, or comparison**.

Let’s slow this down and deal with facts.

# 1. Energy use ≠ moral singularity

Yes, generative AI consumes energy.  
So does:

* cloud storage
* streaming video
* gaming
* cryptocurrency
* email
* search engines
* air conditioning
* food delivery
* literally the device you’re posting from

Energy consumption is a **systems problem**, not a sin unique to one tool.

If the argument were honest, it would be comparative:

* *How much energy?*
* *Compared to what?*
* *Per unit of output?*
* *Relative to alternatives?*

Instead, we get **vibes-based apocalypse rhetoric**.

# 2. The water claim is wildly misrepresented

The most-cited statistic in these threads is some variation of:

>“One AI image wastes gallons of water.”

This is **false by omission and framing**.

What’s actually being referenced:

* indirect cooling water used by **data centers**, amortized across **millions of operations**
* often based on **worst-case estimates**
* frequently conflated with *per-image* usage rather than *per-infrastructure* usage

For comparison:

* a single hamburger uses **\~2,000 liters of water**
* a cup of coffee: **\~140 liters**
* streaming HD video for an hour: **significant energy draw**
* social media image hosting already exists at massive scale

If someone only panics when the output is *AI-generated*, they are not making an environmental argument — they are making a **selective moral argument**.

# 3. “Killing animals” is emotional manipulation

No credible evidence exists that:

* AI image generation is uniquely responsible for animal deaths
* wildlife impact is meaningfully different from other digital infrastructure
* banning AI would materially reduce ecological harm without addressing the broader grid

This framing exists to **short-circuit reasoning**, not to inform.

# 4. This is not “doing research” - it’s repeating slogans

A pattern emerges in these exchanges:

* links are vaguely referenced
* numbers are rounded into horror stories
* scale is never discussed
* alternatives are never compared
* tradeoffs are never acknowledged

That’s **cargo-cult environmentalism**.

Real environmental critique:

* compares systems
* acknowledges baselines
* proposes mitigation
* doesn’t rely on shock value

# 5. Calling disagreement “insane” is projection

When someone responds to pushback with:

>“You’re uneducated, crazy, and lack empathy”

That’s a tell.

It means the claim **cannot survive scrutiny**, so emotional escalation replaces evidence.

If your position collapses the moment someone asks:

>“Compared to what?”

…it wasn’t a position. It was a belief.

# The core issue

This isn’t about protecting the planet.  
It’s about **finding a socially acceptable target for moral outrage**.

AI became that target because:

* it’s new
* it’s abstract
* it’s poorly understood
* it threatens identity, not ecosystems

Environmental harm is real.  
Climate change is real.  
Energy usage matters.

But **turning AI into a singular villain while ignoring every other energy-intensive system is not activism** \- it’s misinformation dressed up as concern.

Argue against AI if you want.  
Regulate it if necessary.  
Critique corporations.  
Push for greener infrastructure.

But if your argument requires exaggeration, scale erasure, and moral panic to function - it will always lose the moment facts enter the room.

And that’s why these claims keep collapsing.",1,1768757086.0,ShitLudditesSay,0,1.0,False
1qgehml,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/1qgehml/is_this_a_viable_offline_advertising_channel_for/,Is this a viable offline advertising channel for larger brands?,"Hey everyone - I’m doing some early-stage market research on a new offline advertising concept and I’d love honest, critical feedback from people who work in marketing, brand, growth, or media buying.

**The idea:**

Instead of just billboards, posters, or bus ads, brands can sponsor **to-go coffee cups**.  
A company buys blocks of branded cups, and those cups get distributed for free to consumers in the area selected by the brand.

So if a brand wants to target commuters in Manchester, London, Leeds, etc., their branding and message/CTA appears on thousands of takeaway cups in those areas.

The thinking is that this channel is:  
• Offline and real-world (like billboards, OOH, transit ads)  
• Hyper-targeted by location  
• High frequency (people carry the cup around)  
• High goodwill (people associate it with something positive - coffee)

**I’m** ***not*** **selling anything here** \- just genuinely trying to understand if this is:  
A) A serious marketing channel  
B) A gimmick  
C) Something brands would only test at a small scale

My questions:

👉 If you work with brands or in marketing:  
• Would this be something you’d consider testing?  
• What would make it feel legit vs gimmicky?  
• How would you measure success?  
• What kind of brand or campaign do you think this fits best?

👉 If you’ve bought offline ads before:  
• Would this sit alongside billboards / transit / posters - or not really?  
• What budget range would make sense for something like this to try?

I’m especially interested in hearing from:  
• Media buyers  
• Brand managers  
• Growth marketers  
• Anyone who’s run OOH / offline campaigns

Brutal honesty is welcome. If it’s bad, tell me why. If it’s interesting, tell me what would need to be true for it to actually work.

1qgehi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Handhelds/comments/1qgehi5/acer_nitro_v_or_legion_go/,Acer Nitro V or Legion Go,"Hi! So right now I have the Acer Nitro V 4050 with 8GB RAM. I'm debating on trying to sell it and pick up an almost new Legion Go someone is selling on marketplace. The deal is pretty good! They have a docking station and Bluetooth mouse and keyboard and a 27"" curved monitor they will throw in for an extra $50. So $650 altogether. Which is a few bucks more than I got my laptop for on sale. I do like my laptop, BUT at only 8GB RAM I can't play most AAA games. I bought Oblivion Remastered and couldn't play because it requires at least 16GB minimum. And adding more RAM right now is not feasible with the price of it right now. Not to mention, I mostly play on my couch. And the laptop isn't all that comfortable to keep on my lap long term. I usually put it on my coffee table and use a PS5 controller but it takes up space and gets in the way. Plus the freaking fans sound like a jet engine when it's running full steam. Would it be worthwhile to consider selling and picking up the Legion Go? Or would I end up regretting selling my laptop? ",2,1768757029.0,Handhelds,4,0.75,False
1qgehg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurs/comments/1qgehg6/i_tracked_my_first_90_days_starting_online_heres/,"""I tracked my first 90 days starting online. Here's the reality (no sugarcoating).""","I see so many ""I made $10K in 30 days"" posts. Let me show you what my first 90 days actually looked like.

**The Backstory:**  
I was that person downloading every free course, jumping between ""methods,"" feeling overwhelmed, and quietly quitting every 2 weeks. Sound familiar?Then I committed to ONE thing for 90 days. Here's what happened:

# MONTH 1: THE REALITY

**Time invested:** 5-7 hours/week (mostly evenings)  
**Money made:** $0 (actually negative if you count coffee)  
**What I actually did:**

* Week 1: Learned to make basic Canva designs (3 YouTube tutorials)
* Week 2-3: Created 10 practice projects (all terrible)
* Week 4: Made a ""portfolio"" of my 3 least-terrible projects

**What nobody tells you:**  
• Your first 20 attempts will suck  
• You'll feel like you're wasting time  
• Comparison will try to kill your progress

**My Month 1 win:** I could finally make something without following a tutorial step-by-step.

# MONTH 2: THE FIRST EXCHANGES

**Time:** 6-8 hours/week  
**Money:** $45 total (from 3 tiny projects)  
**What happened:**

* Offered free work to 2 small businesses
* One turned into a $15 paid project
* Got 2 testimonials (priceless)

**The painful truth:**  
• ""Exposure"" doesn't pay bills, but it builds proof  
• Your first prices are a ""learning tax""  
• Most outreach gets ignored (that's normal)

**My Month 2 win:** Completed my first paid project without panicking.

# MONTH 3: THE MOMENTUM

**Time:** Same 6-8 hours (but more efficient)  
**Money:** $180 (one recurring client + two small projects)  
**The shift:**

* Could deliver work in half the time
* Had actual examples to show
* Knew what to charge (and why)

**What changed:**  
• Stopped comparing to experts  
• Measured progress by skills, not dollars  
• Built simple systems (templates, workflows)

**My Month 3 win:** Had a small but real income stream that covered my internet bill.

# WHAT I LEARNED (THE REAL VALUE):

1. **The Rule of One:** You can't master 3 skills at once. Choose ONE.
2. **Progress > Perfection:** Done is better than perfect. Always.
3. **Time > Talent:** Consistency beats ""natural ability"" every time.
4. **Systems > Motivation:** When motivation fades (it will), systems keep you going.

# MY SIMPLE 3-QUESTION STARTING QUIZ:

If you're overwhelmed by choices, ask yourself:

1. **Feedback style:** Do you prefer private feedback (A) or public engagement (B)?
2. **Time reality:** Do you have predictable hours (A) or unpredictable (B)?
3. **Energy source:** Do tasks (A) or creativity (B) energize you?

Mostly A's = Start with micro-tasks (freelancing)  
Mostly B's = Start with content creation  
Mix = Start with solving one specific problem

# THE PART NOBODY SHARES:

Between Day 45-60, I almost quit.  
The excitement wore off. Progress felt slow.  
What kept me going? Lowering my daily goal from ""get a client"" to ""complete one practice project.""

Your job isn't to succeed in 30 days.  
Your job is to not quit for 90 days.

**Why share this?** Because beginner journeys are messy, slow, and full of doubt. If you're in that place right now it's normal. You're not behind. You're learning.

# QUESTIONS I'LL ANSWER IN COMMENTS:

* What skill did you choose and why?
* How did you find your first clients?
* What free tools actually helped?
* How do you deal with comparison?
* What does a ""practice project"" look like?

**The idea:**

Instead of just billboards, posters, or bus ads, brands can sponsor **to-go coffee cups**.  
A company buys blocks of branded cups, and those cups get distributed for free to consumers in the area selected by the brand. 

So if a brand wants to target commuters in Manchester, London, Leeds, etc., their branding and message/CTA appears on thousands of takeaway cups in those areas.

The thinking is that this channel is:  
• Offline and real-world (like billboards, OOH, transit ads)  
• Hyper-targeted by location  
• High frequency (people carry the cup around)  
• High goodwill (people associate it with something positive – coffee)

**I’m** ***not*** **selling anything here** – just genuinely trying to understand if this is:  
A) A serious marketing channel  
B) A gimmick  
C) Something brands would only test at a small scale

My questions:

👉 If you work with brands or in marketing:  
• Would this be something you’d consider testing?  
• What would make it feel legit vs gimmicky?  
• How would you measure success?  
• What kind of brand or campaign do you think this fits best?

👉 If you’ve bought offline ads before:  
• Would this sit alongside billboards / transit / posters – or not really?  
• What budget range would make sense for something like this to try?

I’m especially interested in hearing from:  
• Media buyers  
• Brand managers  
• Growth marketers  
• Anyone who’s run OOH / offline campaigns

Brutal honesty is welcome. If it’s bad, tell me why. If it’s interesting, tell me what would need to be true for it to actually work.

Three years ago, I attended a course at Goethe-Institut Delhi. Our teacher made a WhatsApp group for class updates. I never spoke to this particular classmate in class. We didn’t know each other and never had any personal interaction.

I NEVER EVEN SAID HI TO HIM, NOT EVEN A FAKE SMILE. NOT EVEN A SINGLE SENTENCE CONVERSATION.

One evening, he messaged me on WhatsApp asking if I wanted to go for coffee. He got my number from the class group. I clearly said no. After that, he kept messaging me, so I blocked him.

After being blocked, he started calling and texting me from different phone numbers. More than 100 calls for no reason.. when i will answer, he will say : helloo.. hmmm.. pehchana?

At that time, someone I know contacted the police, and he was warned. The messages stopped for a while.

Earlier this year, after I changed my phone, he messaged me again. I blocked him immediately. Now, for the past few weeks, he has started again, using new numbers to call and message me. I never reply. I have saved all screenshots and call logs.

From each number, his texts are different, for example

Text from number (1) - Tere maa baap ne kuch bola kya darta nahi azma ke dekh le?

Text from number (2) - Hi guess who I am, my pronouns are they/them

Text from (3) I don’t deserve a silent treatment. Please reply tell me the truth atleast.

So I started experimenting with other methods and ended up with a simple 10-minute routine that keeps my drip coffee maker clean *without* vinegar stench. Here’s what I do:

**My 10-minute, no-vinegar routine:**

1. Empty the machine and throw away the used filter.
2. Wash the carafe and basket with warm soapy water.
3. Mix a cleaning solution (I use food-grade citric acid: 1 tbsp in 1 liter of warm water – lemon juice or baking soda also work).
4. Pour it into the reservoir and start a brew cycle.
5. When about half has run through, I switch the machine off and let it sit for \~15 minutes.
6. Turn it back on and let the rest run through.
7. Then I run **2 full cycles of plain water** to rinse everything.
8. Wipe the outside and leave the lid open to air out.

This got rid of both the weird coffee taste **and** the usual vinegar cloud in my kitchen.

  
I also took some photos of the process and wrote it up as a tiny, beginner-friendly PDF for myself and a few friends. If anyone wants the full step-by-step with pictures then please message me.

My girlfriend is super career-oriented and always busy with work, which I respect, but it means she’s never really available.

It’s a weird spot to be in, just waiting for the other shoe to drop while feeling like a secondary priority.

I order the same thing: a small coffee, no sugar. The place is quiet at that hour, mostly regulars who don’t talk much. The kind of routine that makes days blur together.

That’s why I noticed the receipt.

The first time, I thought it was nothing. The total was correct, the date was correct, but the order number was 0381. I didn’t think much of it until the next morning.

Same coffee.

Same time.

Same order number.

I asked the barista if the machine was broken. She smiled politely and said no. New paper, new ink, everything normal.

On the third day, I paid attention to the people before me. Different customers, different orders. Their receipts had different numbers.

Mine was still 0381.

I kept them.

After a week, I had seven identical receipts, each with a different date but the same number. I showed them to the manager. He frowned, checked the system, and told me there was no issue logged under that number.

“Maybe you’re picking up the wrong receipt,” he suggested.

I wasn’t.

The café became uncomfortable after that. Not threatening—just slightly off. The barista would pause before handing me my coffee, like she was waiting for something. Once, she almost said my name, then stopped herself.

On the tenth day, I didn’t go.

At 7:42, my phone buzzed with a notification from my bank. A charge from the café.

Small coffee. No sugar.

Order number: 0381.

The next morning, I went back.

The café was closed.

The windows were papered over, a sign taped to the door: Closed for renovation. I stood there longer than I should have, staring at my reflection in the glass.

Later that day, I called my bank. They confirmed the charge but couldn’t explain how it went through. No location data. No terminal ID.

That night, I checked the receipts again.

There was something I hadn’t noticed before. At the bottom, beneath the legal text, a faint line of print—so light it almost blended into the paper.

Thank you for your consistency.

I don’t go to cafés anymore.

But every now and then, at exactly 7:42 a.m.,

I get a notification for a small coffee I didn’t buy.

Always the same order.

I think I am a good listener, though I might be a little quiet or unsure how to open up when we first start talking. Please don't feel pressured on ""long-term""—it's just a hopeful goal. If you ever feel uncomfortable with our conversations, please feel free to tell me. We can figure out together whether it's just me adjusting or if we might not be the best fit as close friends.

Also, English is not my native language(In fact Chinese) so there may be some odd expressions.

I’m hoping for friends around my age, but it's not a strict requirement. I just worry about finding common topics to talk about.

Here’s a bit about me:

· Anime: I enjoy anime, though my taste might lean a bit toward older series. I'm a fan of Type-Moon (like tsukihime and fate).
· Games: I love gaming, especially RPGs. I play mostly on PC—my favorite series are Monster Hunter and Dark Souls. I also play mobile games, including Arknights and Honkai: Star Rail.
· Art: I enjoy drawing and have tried oils, pastels, acrylics, and sketching. I’d like to learn watercolor but haven't found the time yet. Lately, I've been spending a lot of time making anime figures.
· Cooking: I like cooking, both meals and desserts, though living in a dorm limits my chances to experiment.
· Interests: I have a bit of an interest in ancient history and mythology, especially Egypt—I even tried learning a little ancient Egyptian once.
· Music: kinda strange? I enjoy power mental .
· Drinks: black tea and coffee.

If you'd like to know more about anything, please ask! I'm open to questions. Feel free to send me a message if you're interested in chatting.

1qge5lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qge5lw/hr_friends/,[HR] <Friends>,"I opened my eyes to complete darkness and the feeling of a snuggly feather duvet. I took a deep breath in and enjoyed the woody scent of my night shelter to a melody of absolute silence. What time was it? My arm reached for my smartphone on the side table. A white six thirty-two flashed above my usual mountain range wallpaper.

Two years ago, I relocated to Zurich after accepting a senior position from a big financial group, expecting a tamer workload than in London. Unfortunately, the hours were still long and strenuous, and my colleagues— But the pay was fantastic and the country beautiful. From the city centre, on a clear day, you could see the Alps, a wall of majestic mountains teasing from beneath the sky.  
Earlier this month, in dire need of a green break, I booked a one-night shelter in the middle of a two-day hike, two hours southeast of Zurich.

Yesterday, after a five-hour trek alternating between pine forests and breathtaking cliffs, waterfalls, and distant glaciers, I reached the shelter. It was incredible.  
I expected the usual bring-your-own-sleeping-bag, cramped dorm with a fireplace, outside latrines, and maybe a tiny gas kitchen, but this was a five-star Airbnb in the wild. The house was a scarlet-painted, one-bedroom, wooden cottage. The inside was similar to a modern, fully furnished apartment. There was a big and cozy livingroom, its walls painted with the same scarlet, adorned with photographs of local mountain ranges. Against the entrance wall was a three-people woolen beige couch facing an ashen coffee table next to a wooden armchair. The kitchen had a gas stove and oven, and a fridge full of fresh meat and vegetables. The immaculate bathroom was equipped with an automated Japanese toilet and an Italian shower with hot water on tap.  
At first, I believed I must have entered the wrong house. Especially, there was only one large king-size bed in the bedroom. But a leaflet at the entrance presented the house as the shelter I had booked, with explanations on how to use the appliances. I knew Switzerland was wealthy, but that was way beyond my wildest trekking dreams.

  
And now, after the best sleep of my life, my heart ached to leave this heavenly home. I still had a six-hour scenic trek to complete, followed by a two-hour drive back.  
I flipped on the small lamp on the side table. It projected a dimmed amber light on the ceiling and walls. Reluctantly, I slipped out of the snuggly comforter and opened the curtains to… pitch-black darkness. I could only stare at the reflection of my thirty-five-year old face, with his scruffy liquorice hair and not-shaved-yet twenty-four-hour beard.  
It was the middle of July. The sun should have risen before six. I glanced at my phone again: six thirty-six. And, wasn’t there a pine tree just outside?

Still in my underwears I opened the entrance door, expecting to be graced by the crispy mountain air, but the temperature was as balmy as inside. A long juniper light pole clicked and lit up by itself, beaming an eerie white light on a small white metallic garden table with a single white chair, both adorned with pink flower motifs. The table and chair waited on green trimmed grass, two metres in front of the entrance. The grass extended for around three more metres and ended.  
Yes, ended.  
I staggered outside, passed the table, and reached the “edge of grass” to find… nothing. Only pitch black darkness above, below, left and right. I was on a small island, floating in an ocean of void.

The first days were unnerving. I thought I was dreaming. But when I kept waking up, day after day, in the same place, I became enraged. I cursed this island of solitude and whoever trapped me here. I stabbed, sliced, tore, and shredded the furniture, shattered all the tableware, and threw the small table and chair into the abyss, only to find everything back and mended on the next day. I begged whoever was listening to reveal what it wanted from me. I wanted to scream at the abyss, but refrained, afraid of what would answer. Then, desperate, I contemplated jumping from the edge.

Every day, the fridge opened, refilled. Water, hot or cold, never ran out. No matter how long I let it run. Even the coffee machine had a bottomless stock of coffee beans.  
A small walnut-coloured vintage Victor radio was sitting on a shelf in the livingroom. When on, it was somehow capturing several stations, constantly playing classic, rock, metal, and other genres of music with an impeccable sound quality. On the bookshelf rested a collection of award-winning books, including The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, illustrated by J. R. R. himself.

One day, after my depressed episode, I decided to exploit the little control I still had, starting with an improvised twenty-minute workout session with bodyweight squats, push-ups, and crunches. In the bathroom, I found a trimmer and used it on my overgrown beard and hair. Smiling back in the mirror, I finally recognised myself – a far cry from my old athletic self, but still myself.  
The little workout made me feel so energised that I wished my gaoler had built a little home gym. I missed a real squat rack, bench, and pull-up bar, and... nevermind.  
The next morning, I was enjoying a nutty and creamy coffee, sitting in the front yard with the old abyss, when I noticed the house had a new extension. Connected on its left was what looked like a parking box.  
The heavy parking door tilted open. Inside was a concrete three-by-three metres room equipped with a squat rack, a bench, and a pull-up bar.

https://preview.redd.it/khzbt5dku4eg1.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfdaab5d48afb411f50f79b5521f25f4985a1915

In [Lesson 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qeo0bq/what_is_cryptocurrency_after_all_the_bitcoin/), we learned that Bitcoin is ""digital cash"" that removes the bank from the middle. In [Lesson 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1qfrs8w/the_evolution_of_money_debt_barter_gold_fiat_and/), we learned that money is a technology we use to track value, and Bitcoin could be the next evolution, fixing the infinite “money printing” of Fiat.

But this leaves a technical hole in the story.

If there is no bank... **who keeps track of the money?**

The answer is the engine that powers the entire industry. The **Blockchain**.

# The Problem: The Trust Gap

In the old world, you trusted the Bank to keep the ""Master Ledger"" (the record of all accounts) safe in their private books/ledger.

* Bob has 100 coins
* Alice has 20 coins
* Bob sent Alice 10 coins
* Bob now has 90 coins
* Alice now has 30 coins

You couldn't see it. You just had to trust that they wouldn't delete your money or freeze your account. Up until the 1960s, these books were physical. Currently, they are on the bank's servers.

https://preview.redd.it/qy9qifytu4eg1.jpg?width=612&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efad36007b03065cee1ba5109d3b4b71eca5705c

In addition, you had to trust that the money kept its value. Even though, historically, fiat money has always gone to zero.

Satoshi Nakamoto realized that to build a decentralized currency, we didn't need a better bank. We needed to get rid of the secret book entirely.

And we needed to have control of the creation of this new form of money.

# The Solution: The Public Ledger

A ledger is basically a book.

Imagine a Book that anyone can read in the middle of the internet’s Town Square.

Anyone in town can walk up to this book and post a signed transaction.

“*Bob pays Alice 5 coins. Signed Bob”*

Everyone else can see it. Because everyone can see it, everyone knows exactly how much money everyone else has. You can’t lie and say “I have 100 coins” if the board clearly shows you only received 50.

In technical terms, this is a **Distributed Public Ledger**.

* **Distributed:** Everyone has a copy.
* **Public:** Anyone can read it.
* **Ledger:** It’s just a list of transactions.

This is only possible because we can verify digital signatures with reasonable security. This is due to a technical thing called “Public key/Private Key Cryptography”, a relatively recent mathematical advancements (from the 1970s) that computers and the internet allowed us to implement for this end. We can now verify that Bob signed the transaction without even the verifiers being able to fake Bob’s signature.

[The bitcoin ledger looks eerily similar to old bank ledgers](https://preview.redd.it/sz2wwb7qw4eg1.png?width=1615&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f76c0c1ceede14da1567284b74dc4c12bb83577)

# Blocks and Chains

So, why is it called a ""Blockchain""?

Think of the entire history of Bitcoin transactions not as a random list, but as an organized ledger full of pages (blocks). The blocks are connected to each other, forming a chain of blocks.

https://preview.redd.it/e0nxtjsay4eg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8160c9da781d5ff2004b41218e919cef156748bc

1. **The Transaction:** You buy coffee. This data is written down.
2. **The Block (The Page):** Eventually, the page gets full of transactions. A ""Bookkeeper"" (Miner) verifies that the transactions are valid, seals the page, and adds a timestamp. This sealed page is a **Block**. The miner usually receives a small amount of BTC for this ""bookkeeping"". These are called ""mined bitcoin"". They may also receive a transaction fee from users.
3. **The Chain (The Glue):** This is the magic part. Before the Miner starts a *new* page, they take a mathematical ""fingerprint"" (hash) of the *previous* page and write it at the top of the new one. Like numbered pages.

This links all pages together digitally.

If even a single transaction or block is different, the entire chain collapses. The network sees the broken chain, rejects it, and accepts the real chain that everyone else is holding.

This makes the history of money **Immutable** (unchangeable).

# The First Page: The Genesis Block

Every chain has to start somewhere. You can trace every single Bitcoin in existence back to when it was first ""mined"", through the pages of history, all the way to **Page 1**.

We call this **The Genesis Block (Block 0)**.

When Satoshi Nakamoto mined this first block on January 3rd, 2009, he didn't just start a currency. He left a message inside the code of the first transaction: a digital timestamp to prove exactly when it began, and perhaps, *why* it began.

Included in the raw data of that first block was this text:

>*""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks""*

https://preview.redd.it/ssgop084z4eg1.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bfcae7609766c02ea2a316c7f523d26f1e3ecea

It was a direct reference to the front page of *The Times* newspaper in London that day. It served two purposes:

1. **Proof of Timestamp:** Proving Bitcoin wasn't pre-mined in secret years prior.
2. **A Declaration:** The headline was about the failure of the modern banking system (bailing out banks after the 2008 crisis with newly printed money). Bitcoin was the answer.

# Summary

A Blockchain is not magic. Even though we like to joke that it is. ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"".

https://preview.redd.it/f4se30zo35eg1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03a3be5ad33f3887baf5865d3ddbc6518afcb6f8

Blockchain is a Shared Notebook of history.

* Instead of a bank hiding the ledger, everyone holds a copy.
* **Blocks** are the pages of history.
* **Chains** are the mathematical proof that the pages haven't been torn out or rewritten.

# The 21 Million Bitcoin

One final rule governs this public notebook, and it is perhaps the most important one. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed endlessly by central banks effectively diluting your savings, the Bitcoin software has a hard limit: there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. This rule is absolute and is protected by the consensus of the entire network.

If a miner tries to create more coins than the schedule allows, the rest of the network will reject their page as ""fake"". Only real bitcoins can go on the blockchain.

This makes Bitcoin the first strictly scarce digital object in history. Once the final fraction of a coin is mined (estimated around the year 2140), the supply stops increasing forever, and miners will only earn small transaction fees paid by users.

(This 21 Million hard limit is ONLY FOR Bitcoin. Other CryptoCurrencies may or may not have hard caps)

# What came after the Bitcoin Revolution?

Now that we know how Bitcoin works, it's time to learn about how millions of other CryptoCurrencies and CryptoAssets came to be.

Bitcoin was the first successful case, but it wasn't the only one. People quickly started to disagree with Satoshi's visions, terms, and even the technology.

They lauched their own CryptoCurrency.

What differentiates Bitcoin from other newer Cryptos?

And finally, a young men's idea to transform Bitcoin into a decentralized internet computer ends up creating the world's second largest Crypto?

That’s the subject of Lesson 4. See you then.

As a Northeast Philly resident, I wanted to dedicate this group a bit to the area itself. So, events will generally take place up in the northeast, because we also have many great coffee and bubble tea shops, and you know we has plenty of great food up here. 

The areas of interest and target audience would be around **Mayfair, Rhawnhurst, Upper Pennypack Lexington Park, the Roosevelt Mall, Bustleton Ave, Cottman, etc**. Anywhere within 20 minutes or so of the northeast is up for grabs as an event spot. We've got plenty of restaurants and even some Hot Pot we could check out.

I have some background in tech and job hunting, so I don't mind helping some of the younger folks get started. I'm an OG at heart though so there's not a hard age range in mind for people to join the group. 

  
I want to see what this group can turn into, because I haven't seen anything for the Northeast region. We'll keep the meetups a mix of fun and seriousness as we expand our networks and help each other move towards their goals. Even if your goal is just to hangout in the area, that's a great one to have!

Little blurb about myself:

I’m Vlad, a Northeast Philly native who loves a good challenge—whether it's building data pipelines, mastering a new language (Japanese, Spanish, and Mandarin are my current focuses), or navigating a new city in Europe or Asia.  
**What I bring to the table:**

* **A Curious Mind:** Always up for a chat about investing, business, or psychology.
* **A Local Guide:** I know my way around Chinatown, Cheltenham, City Ave, and beyond. If you're looking for the best food in the city, I've got you covered.
* **Shared Interests:** Big fan of movies, anime, and music.

My goal is to inspire others to chase their projects and find local partners to collaborate with. Let's make the Northeast a hub for growth and good vibes!

For chatting, I started a Discord here, so definitely sign up and join if you're looking for some Northeast Philly adventures: [https://discord.gg/rMUX3EK2](https://discord.gg/rMUX3EK2)",2,1768756037.0,philly,0,0.75,False

I’m trimming down the collection and these are up for grabs! Feel free to ask any questions, thank you! Payment through PayPal F&F, prices include shipping in CONUS.

Hitohira FG 240 mm gyuto- $275

Purchased from Bernal Cutlery with the saya for $310. It’s been used once. I wanted to try Hitohira and I understand why these are respected. Here’s the information from Bernal, they can describe it better than me. Factory edge, first owner, knife and saya only.

Hand ground VG10 mono steel with a nice taper and convex hamaguri grind. This fine grind makes for smooth cutting and excellent food release with a long edge life and excellent stainless property. The heat treatment on this VG10 is one of the better ones we have come across with much nice edge formation, sharpenability and toughness.

Excellent quality grinding and finish on these, possibly some of the best in their price range. We have sharpened these for many years and can say with full confidence it rivals much more expensive prestigious Japanese monosteel brands.

Masakage Shimo 240mm gyuto with White #2- $240

Purchased from CKTG for $290. This was my main knife for a while and it’s been used. The damascus takes a beautiful patina, I’ll also offer to coffee patina the blade on request if you desire a less reactive knife. This version was ground when Kurosaki was working with his brother and the grind is better than the Shimos available today. Sharpened, first owner, knife only.

Hatsukokoro Aogami Super Hayabusa 150mm Petty- $120 

Purchased from District Cutlery for $160. I used it three times and added a coffee patina to the core steel. It’s a phenomenal laser petty for intricate garnishes and trimming. The right side of the blade has a blemish from a sponge that’s only visible at a certain angle. Occasionally japanese knives don’t come with a great edge intentionally from factory, I sharpened it to a razor. First owner, comes with box.

J.A. Henckles 108-12 Carbon Steel Bunka- $80 

This was handed down to me as a project. The blade was originally a 12 inch length and I added a K-tip to make it a bunka for poultry prep. It sounds weird but works very well. This knife was forged over a 100 years ago. I don’t process birds as frequently as I used to and wanted to see if a vintage collector would appreciate it more than the knife sitting in a roll.

1qge0ui,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLeisureTime/comments/1qge0ui/ideaswishes_for_future_updates/,Ideas/Wishes for Future Updates,"Hi all, I wanted to share some ideas I had as well as things I would like to see because I'm obsessed with this game (reached level 50 fairly fast & have spent real money on it 😅) and wanted to see what ideas other players also have!

1. I've seen a lot of people, specifically in the Facebook group, say they wish all furniture could be turned 360° which I understand, but that's the point of buying the ""backs"" of furniture (which >is< pretty low on items for now). Perhaps, in the future, they could have all furniture items be 360° but then the back furniture pieces that we've already received or that will be available in the shop could be items that can be placed at an angle? Sometimes with designs I have, I'd like to be able to place it at an angle and not one of the four cardinal directions if that makes sense. For example, if I want one of the swing chairs or lazy sofas to be in the corner, it would have to be parallel to one of the walls but I feel it would be cute to be able to angle it so it faces the room!

2. The ability to places ornaments in more spots. I play a lot of decorating/organizing games, and I love the ones where I'm able to place items inside stuff like the fridge, bookshelves, closets, etc. With the cooking & fashion items we can buy from the town area, it would be so nice to be able to store these items in fridges or vanities :)

3. Blank mannequins to display clothing items we've received in our builds/weekly design contests. Sometimes I just really wanna display the cute clothing pieces I've gotten because they fit the theme of my designs. For example, the half butterfly face mask would've been perfect to display in the Butterfly Grove contest.

4. Ways to permanently display the flowers we grow. I think it would be easy enough to create a space like the coffee/cooking/fishing merch where you can buy furniture versions of the flowers! It would be fun if we could pick what kind of pot/vase they're in as well. 

5. The ability to have more friends, shared spaces, and garden spaces. I just like decorating and giving gifts to friends 😭

6. Lastly, I've seen many other people mention this too, but I wish the friendship shop items could be used in our main builds. Not only are the pieces super cute, a lot of them can be pretty spendy, so it would be nice to be able to use them in more spaces. 

Sorry this got so long, like I said I just love this game so much and I'm excited to see what the future brings! I'm not super knowledgeable on what's confirmed to be coming in future updates or when those updates are happening, so maybe some of this is already planned and I just don't know it haha.

1qgdwec,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qgdwec,A Latvian Ration I Actually Liked!,"Hi folks!

Well, 2026 has ushered in a new Era, one where Latvian rations may just move up on my scale of least favorite rations (currently they are my 2nd least favorite, trailing only Singaporean). 

Two previous reviews I posted were not kind to the modern Latvian rations, but this older variant, with a best by date of 2022, has definitely changed my mind a bit. Total calories in this ration were just over 2000 kcal, so quite a bit for a single meal. It's unclear whether this is an 8hr or 12 hr ration, but at that calorie density, I'm leaning toward a 12hr version. 

Shout out to u/AllOutZZ for this ration hookup, which he gifted me when I purchased a Danish ration from him; appreciate you man!

Apologies for the lengthy write-up, but I had a lot to say about this one!

Pics 1-2 show packaging and contents.  Quite a nice spread here with 4 coffees, which is crazy in my opinion! No coffee prepared in this review as they will all be used in my morning protein shakes!

Pic 3 shows the wet wipe. Strong odor on this and was very wet, even for being many years past the best by date. 

Pic 4 shows the candies!!! These were absolutely fantastic and some of the best boiled sweets I've ever had! Flavors were orange, pineapple, and grapefruit! Well, I think that yellow one was pineapple,  but it may have been lemon....I can't remember. These were super slick/smooth with vibrant flavors. The grapefruit one was amazing, but it only came with one 😞.

Pic 5 shows the green tea and apricot jam. Yep, that jam is shriveled and dried up, but I ate it anyway. I actually put the jam into the tea! It helped flavor it just a bit. I did eat a chunk before dropping it in and it tasted like oxidized apricots!

Pic 6 shows the dried cranberries and raisins.  These were fantastic! Sweet and tart with great chewiness and texture!

Pic 7 shows the mushroom Porridge. This was a freeze-dried component that was rehydrated with 100 mL of boiling water. I was a bit worried on this one because the package had a small pinhole. I made it in a US hot beverage bag by adding the water,  mixing well, and allowing to sit for 8 min per the directions. This stuff was actually pretty darn good. Great texture on the rice, a nice savory flavor with subdued mushroom notes. A very nice addition to the ration. 

Pic 8 shows the gum. A stick of gum which you don't see much. The flavor and texture here were fantastic. A really nice chew on this gum.

Pic 9 shows the rye bread and dried up strawberry jam. I did not have high hopes for this bread being several years past date, but low and behold, this stuff was actually pretty decent! Maybe it's growing on me after several times having it. The jam, although dried up, was eaten completely with this. Funny enough, doggo wanted nothing to do with this rye bread. It's pretty clear to me that when this ration was fresh, those 2 jams would have been fantastic with this rye bread! The bread has a hearty bite and chew with a slight sourness and sweetness. If you've never had, it's an experience for sure!

Pic 10 shows the main, chicken and rice. Ok, this main was, hands down, the most calorically dense main dish I ever recall seeing, ever. 

According to the label, this main has 443 kcal per 100 grams, and the dish is 250 grams; that means this single can of chicken and rice has 1108 kcal. 

Now, I thought to myself, this can't be right, maybe the label is wrong and its 443 kcal in total, which, at the surface, makes more sense. Lets put this into perspective, the US MREs do not have a single main that cracks 400 kcal, let along over a 1000 kcal. 

So, I added up everything in the entire ration and the only way this ration totals over 2000 kcal is if that main really has 1108 kcal. It's mind boggling.

The pic shows 1/2 of the main, because 1108 kcal is far too much for 1 meal for me. I fried this one in a skillet with some crushed red pepper and cayenne.  Wow! Such a savory chicken flavor with fantastic unprocessed chicken! It had a great texture and tasted great too. I can really appreciate how much this one would be loved by the troops, unless they had to eat it cold, because that would not be ideal folks. 

In summary,  this older variant is, by far, superior to the modern Latvian rations and their terrible,  bland, beans and lentils. Also, canned mains are incredible! If you can get your hands on one of these brown bag (or black bag) Latvian, grab it!

Take Care folks!

1qgdvyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lusannaa/comments/1qgdvyp/spending_my_birthday_solo_in_berlin_any_ideas/,Spending my birthday solo in Berlin — any ideas?,"Hi everyone,

my name is Liuba, I’m 23, (F), originally from Ukraine, and I’ve been living in Hannover for about six months now.

So here’s a small life situation I didn’t really plan, but here we are.

My birthday is coming up (06.02), and I realized I don’t really want to “celebrate” it in Hannover — no big party mood, no cake with forced enthusiasm. Instead, I decided to escape a bit and visit my sister in Nantes, France.

The thing is: my flight is from Berlin in the evening. So on my actual birthday, I’ll go from Hannover to Berlin, spend the whole day there alone, and only fly out later that night.

It’s my first real solo day in Berlin, and I want to make it nice (and not just walk around questioning my life choices😅🙈)

So my question:

What would you do in Berlin if you had one full day, solo, on your birthday?

I’m not a hardcore museum person and I don’t really care that much about coffee culture. I do love nice, interesting restaurants — but I don’t want to just sit around or wander aimlessly all day. I really enjoy dynamic, interactive things: sports, activities, something that keeps me moving and involved. I’m looking for ideas that feel fun, a bit active, and make the day feel intentional rather than lonely.

Any ideas, places, or “this made my solo day actually great” experiences would be very appreciated.

Thanks 🤍",1,1768755677.0,u_lusannaa,0,1.0,False

It was late when I got home from work. After showering, I sat on the bed, scrolling through my phone, feeling exhausted. Suddenly, a notification popped up, and my heart skipped a beat.

 

“Top Actress Regina Brooks Celebrates Birthday With a Four-Million-Dollar Diamond Necklace Gifted by a Mysterious Tycoon.”

 

I rubbed my eyes, my hands trembling as I zoomed in on the photo. The man in the picture only showed his back. Nonetheless, after three years of marriage, I recognized him instantly. It was my husband, Isaiah Keller—he had a distinct black mole behind his ear that gave him away.

 

Four million dollars was an astronomical amount to me. Just a few days ago, I went shopping with Isaiah and saw a 200-dollar purse that I liked. He said it was too expensive and told me not to buy it.

 

I thought about it and figured 200 dollars could buy enough household supplies to last months, so I let it go. But now, I could not help but feel suffocated.

 

Isaiah and I had met online. After chatting for over two months, we met in person and fell for each other instantly. That Valentine’s Day, he proposed to me with the tab ring of a soda can, promising he would get me a proper diamond ring once he made more money.

 

I said yes because I loved him.

 

Isaiah was an orphan who grew up in an orphanage. He had failed in business and was over one million dollars in debt when we got married, so we kept everything simple.

 

The house we lived in was rented, with me paying the rent every month. I also covered our daily expenses, working a full-time job during the day and taking shifts as a waitress at a restaurant at night.

 

Just after our intimate moment last night, he held me in his arms and said, “Honey, thank you for giving me a home. If it weren’t for you, I’d never know what happiness is.”

 

He started to cry as he added, “Once I’m debt-free, I’ll work hard to buy you a car and a house. I want to give you the life you deserve.”

 

He choked up, “If I hadn’t failed at my business, you wouldn’t have to suffer like this. I’m sorry, honey.”

 

I kissed him and comforted him, saying, “Don’t be sad, honey. As long as I’m with you, I’m happy.”

 

At that moment, I truly believed I was the luckiest woman in the world.

 

Isaiah was handsome. He did not smoke or drink, and he loved me wholeheartedly. Aside from being broke, he was the perfect husband. I believed that if we worked hard enough, we could clear his debts in no time.

 

But now, as I bit my lip, tears streamed down my face. Just as I was crying, I received a text from Isaiah.

 

“Honey, business is really good tonight. I’m staying late to earn more so I can pay off the debt. Don’t wait up for me, okay?”

 

Isaiah worked as a delivery driver during the day and sometimes as a rideshare driver at night. If I had not seen that photo, I would have naively believed he was working late and driving strangers around. I could not understand why he was lying to me.

 

I did not sleep that night, and Isaiah did not come home either.

 

The next morning, I skipped breakfast and left the house feeling like a zombie. As I stepped outside, I spotted a familiar figure across the street and quickly hid behind a tree.

 

Isaiah was stepping out of a Bentley. The expensive suit he had worn last night had been replaced with the cheap T-shirt and jeans I had bought for him.

 

Then, a middle-aged man approached him, respectfully handing over a bag. From the shape of it, I could tell it held my favorite breakfast: soy milk and a bagel.

 

Just as Isaiah took the bag, another car pulled up in front of him. A man I recognized stepped out—he was the CEO of a tech company, someone my friend worked for.

 

The CEO walked up to Isaiah, nodding slightly and speaking in an almost submissive tone. Isaiah, on the other hand, looked relaxed. He rarely acknowledged him.

 

I had heard my friend talk about her superior being a powerful and influential man. Yet, in front of Isaiah, he seemed so small.

 

Isaiah immediately called me when he reached home. I stared at the caller ID “Honey” on my phone screen. My vision blurred with tears, but I took a deep breath and composed myself before answering.

 

“Honey, I’m home. I bought your favorite soy milk and bagel,” he said.

 

I kept my voice steady. “Something came up, so I went to the office early. You can have them.”

 

He sounded disappointed. “Alright, honey. I’ll make something nice for dinner when you get home.”

 

I simply mumbled an acknowledgment and texted my workplace to take the day off. I had to figure out where Isaiah went every day and get to the bottom of this.

 

Since there was a coffee shop across the street, I decided to head over. I sat by the window, keeping a close eye on our building.

 

Around noon, Isaiah finally came out and got back into the Bentley. I slipped on a mask, flagged down a cab, and told the driver to follow him.

 

Before long, we arrived at an upscale restaurant. The moment the Bentley stopped, the valet rushed to open the door for him. Isaiah handed over the keys like he was used to it.

 

I followed carefully as he entered a private room. Through the partially open door, I saw several young men dressed in sharp suits. They looked like the typical rich heirs you would see in tabloids.

 

Pretending to be on a phone call, I loitered in the hallway near the room. From where I stood, I could see the table piled with dishes like lobster, king crab, and caviar—things I would only ever see on cooking shows.

 

“Isaiah, seeing you in those cheap clothes cracks me up. You’re the heir to billions, for crying out loud!”

 

“When are you going to drop this act? Don’t tell me you’re actually falling for Aimee Sinclair, that little country bumpkin!”

 

Isaiah’s voice came through clearly, mocking. “Are you kidding me? She’s just a distraction and nothing more. She’s not worthy of my feelings.”

 

He laughed cruelly. “When I told her I was over a million dollars in debt, she said she’d stick by me and help me pay it off. I’ve never met anyone more gullible or pathetic in love.”

 

The room erupted in laughter, as if they were all mocking me for my stupidity. At that moment, it felt like someone had plunged a blade into my heart, twisting it until I could hardly breathe.",1,1768755636.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I’m trimming down the collection and these are up for grabs! Feel free to ask any questions, thank you! Payment through PayPal, prices include shipping in CONUS. I have 40 swaps and plenty of vouches on knifeswap. I switched back to Japanese knives as my hobby and I’ll start posting here more frequently.

Hitohira FG 240 mm gyuto- $275

Purchased from Bernal Cutlery with the saya for $310. It’s been used once. I wanted to try Hitohira and I understand why these are respected. Here’s the information from Bernal, they can describe it better than me.

Hand ground VG10 mono steel with a nice taper and convex hamaguri grind. This fine grind makes for smooth cutting and excellent food release with a long edge life and excellent stainless property. The heat treatment on this VG10 is one of the better ones we have come across with much nicer edge formation, sharpenability and toughness.

Excellent quality grinding and finish on these, possibly some of the best in their price range. We have sharpened these for many years and can say with full confidence it rivals much more expensive prestigious Japanese monosteel brands.

Masakage Shimo 240mm gyuto with White #2- $225

Purchased from CKTG for $290. This was my main knife for a while and it’s been used. The damascus takes a beautiful patina, I’ll also offer to coffee patina the blade on request if you desire a less reactive knife. This version was ground when Kurosaki was working with his brother and the grind is better than the Shimos available today.

Hatsukokoro Aogami Super Hayabusa 150mm Petty- $120

Purchased from District Cutlery for $160. I used it three times and added a coffee patina to the core steel. It’s a phenomenal laser petty for intricate garnishes and trimming. The right side of the blade has a blemish from a sponge that’s only visible at a certain angle.

J.A. Henckles 108-12 Carbon Steel Bunka- $80

This was handed down to me as a project. The blade was originally a 12 inch length and I added a K-tip to make it a bunka for poultry prep. It sounds weird but works very well. This knife was forged over a 100 years ago. I don’t process birds as frequently as I used to and wanted to see if a vintage collector would appreciate it more than the knife sitting in a roll.",3,1768755564.0,TrueChefKnivesBST,1,1.0,False

*CW: Blood, strong language*

Cats are judgmental little shits. They stare at you, all wide-eyed, innocent, cute, but really? They're judging the fuck out of you. Little demons. How do I know this? I live with one. His name is Milo.

Milo is adorable. Mostly white fur with a small patch of black on his chest just under his head. Reverse tuxedo. Adorable.

Milo is an asshole. Yesterday, I was on my laptop, researching Bartitsu—a very Western combination of fighting styles from around the world—for the new novel I'm working on—a Victorian-era steampunk adventure where jolly ol' England is under threat from a cosmic force—and I might have ignored the alarm that tells me to feed Milo and ignored his desperate cries for food for an hour. Maybe I'm the asshole?

Anyways, Milo comes over and scratches me! On my foot. And not on the top of the foot. He's too smart for that. He gets his little paw underneath my naked foot, swipes hard, draws blood, and then plops his ass in front of me and licks the very paw he assaulted me with. And he just watches me. I'm dripping blood, hissing in pain, and he's watching. Wide-eyed. Innocent. Not cute.

I didn't have anything to staunch the blood. I had to hobble to his dish, bloody footprints staining the faux wood and linoleum floors, and feed him. First. Definitely would not hear the end of it if I hadn't. One can of turkey tidbits in gravy, and he purred. My heart melted. Milo is sweet.

But blood. I did a weird skip-jump thing to the bathroom on one foot, so I wouldn't get blood anywhere else. Massive failure. Ended up just splattering blood everywhere. Wonderful. More cleaning today. I loathe it.

Finally, after an eternity (it wasn't; it was like... thirty seconds), I'm in the bathroom, foot propped up on the sink, faucet running warm water, and I'm scrubbing away with antibacterial, non-scented Dial—allergies—and cursing my adorable little terror. I'm also a little stunned at how much blood is coming from my foot. I made a note of that. Perfect for whenever I get back to the horror novel I'm concepting.

It's like an hour later (it wasn't; it was like five minutes... and yes, I realize I just copied the previous paragraph's structure. Suck it, editors!), and the bleeding is finally stopped. And I have no bandages for an underfoot wound, so I do the next best thing: toilet paper wrapped around my foot. It feels weird to have a mummy foot instead of my foot, but at least I won't get blood anywhere else.

Time to clean. Did I mention I hate cleaning? Its the literal worst. When I was a kid, my parents would have to bribe me to clean. ""We'll take you to a movie!"" ""You can stay up past nine!"" ""You can have a boy over WITH the door closed?"" That last one creeped me out. Why would parents let their daughter have a boy over with the door closed? Aren't they aware of how horny teenage boys are? I know I am. I once got caught in the boys' locker room with Kevin Geffen after he scored a game-winning goal. That was not a fun time to be a daughter to my parents.

Anyways... I'm finally cleaning. After I have a fourth cup of coffee. And a salad. And a whole pint of ice cream. Bleach water in a bottle, spray misting over dried blood, and paper towels massed in wet, bloody bunches on the floor.

Milo watched. Judged. Licked that same damn paw. Bastard. I love him.

Cats are the best, if I'm being honest. I wish I could say I'm unbiased, but I've had cats my whole life. My mom likes to tell the story of when they first brought me home, and their 17-year-old cat Felicia jumped into the pram, lay down next to me, and purred. She also died that night.

""And we said, 'Bye, Felicia!' the next morning,"" my mom always declares. I groan every time. Everyone else laughs, or at least those who haven't heard the story laugh. My first college girlfriend teased me about it all the time, especially because her name was Felicia. I broke up with her after she brought it up at a dinner with the university president. So not cool.

But anyways... Cats. Best. Cuddlers. Judgmental. Milo keeps me honest and on schedule. Without him, I'm not sure I would have ever finished my first novel, a sweet story about two cats who save their human from an alien invasion.

I write weird shit.

At some point, I've made it back to my laptop. The mess is cleaned, and the paper towels are overflowing from my trash can. My fingers are typing. Milo is stretched out in the sun. I keep reading about Bartitsu—it's really absurd and beautiful in the way I think only an Englishman could do—and I'm sipping a particularly delicious Riesling. I know I sighed. In contentment. And Milo definitely cracked on yellow eye at me, probably checking to see if he needed to get my schedule back in order. He didn't. My mom called and invited me to dinner.

He most certainly was judging me again when I left him alone in the apartment. Cats are just like that.",1,1768755377.0,u_EliSimpsonWrites,0,1.0,False

American ambitions to extract and **use Venezuela’s vast oil reserves** [will consume a substantial part](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/12/us-plan-to-exploit-venezuelas-oil-could-eat-up-13-of-carbon-budget-to-keep-15c-limit) of the remaining carbon budget—some 13%—necessary to limit global temperature increase to 1.5 °C, a limit many have argued has already been transgressed. Trump and oil executives hope to surge Venezuelan oil production to over 1.5M barrels/day by 2035. (Saudi Arabia currently produces about 10M barrels/day, though their reserves are less than Venezuela.)

The [**2025 Global Water Monitor Report**](https://www.globalwater.online/globalwater/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GWM-Report-2025.pdf) was released one or two weeks ago, and its 64 pages warn of a warming world, stronger floods, flash droughts, and worsening [climate whiplash](https://phys.org/news/2026-01-minute-climate-whiplash-unpredictable-weather.html). The report claims that **the global water cycle** (patterns of evaporation, precipitation, runoff, etc) **s being destabilized**. Going forward, we can expect more Drought in the Mediterranean Basin, Brazil, and the Horn of Africa. Flooding risks will increase in the Sahel, southern Africa, and large parts of Asia.

>“The number of record-dry months was above average and shows a significant upwards trend of 9.7% per decade…..**Maximum daily precipitation and the frequency of rainfall records broken both show increasing trends**, of 2.3% and 4.5% per decade, respectively….Ten countries recorded their lowest annual precipitation totals on record in 2025….Three Asian countries recorded record-high annual precipitation: India, the Philippines and Viet Nam….Four countries recorded their highest annual daily maximum rainfall in 2025….Record-high annual maximum temperatures were observed in 14 basins and record-high hot days in 12 basins….**Bangladesh faced the worst flooding in more than 30 years** in its southeastern and eastern districts….Super Typhoon Ragasa—ranked the strongest storm worldwide in 2025—peaked with winds of 267 km/h….In Somalia, 4.4 million people faced acute food insecurity by late 2025, with 921,000 in emergency conditions….The storm {Hurricane Melissa} killed at least 75 people and caused economic losses estimated at **US$48–52 billion**…” -selections from [the full report](https://www.globalwater.online/globalwater/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GWM-Report-2025.pdf) 

“Climate projections under moderate emissions pathways suggest a cumulative **decline of 2.8 years in life expectancy by 2100**, amounting to **US$35 trillion losses**.” So says a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-025-02534-4) in *Nature Climate Change* quantifying the damage that will be wrought by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by 2100. “ENSO involves fluctuations between unusually warm (El Niño) and cold (La Niña) sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, triggering global weather extremes such as floods, heat extremes and air pollution. These weather extremes disrupt food security and hinder economic growth….El Niño threatens human health, increasing mortality during event years. It affects multiple health domains, including **infectious and diarrhoeal diseases, cardiovascular and respiratory ailments**, and healthcare system disruptions…” The study believes these impacts will primarily affect younger people, who are more likely to work labor jobs outside. 

An [adjustment of corporate carbon accounting](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67759-5) to the [**Carbon Disclosure Project**](https://www.cdp.net/en/about) found that actual emissions are about 10% greater than previous measurements. The first 10 days of January are already [measuring 1.6 °C warmer](https://x.com/EliotJacobson/status/2010008942248898701) than the baseline. Oil and gas extraction along Nigeria’s river deltas has [resulted in **damage to mangrove populations**](https://theconversation.com/mangrove-loss-is-making-the-niger-delta-more-vulnerable-we-built-a-model-that-can-track-how-the-forests-are-doing-267384) that has also made the coastline more vulnerable to storms and flooding. South Africa has [again broken its monthly heat records](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/2010661082961203234). In a reversal of recent trends, [U.S. carbon emissions rose](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/13/us-carbon-emissions-increase-2025) in 2025, when compared to 2024. 

A [**heat wave** moved](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/2010795019654009191) through Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. [Wild bushfires continued burning](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/jan/13/victorian-bushfire-threat-eases-structures-destroyed) in Victoria, Australia, though they have been lessened a bit. The fires [caused a large death](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/12/flying-foxes-die-in-their-thousands-in-worst-mass-mortality-event-since-australias-black-summer) of flying foxes in the region. The Himalayas are [experiencing a “**snow drought**”](https://archive.ph/1CQNR) this winter, with far less snowfall than usual. The lack of spring snowmelt in India will have repercussions later in the year. 

As land warms, scientists say [we are increasing the odds of a **Dust Bowl 2.0**](https://archive.ph/BAWwg). Some 6 billion people live in areas with quickly decreasing reserves of fresh water. Heat and Drought interactions may make the second Dust Bowl drier, hotter, and longer. In a moment of good news, after some 50 years of annual increasing coal consumption, [**China and India both reportedly decreased coal consumption**](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/jan/13/coal-power-generation-falls-china-india-since-1970s) in 2025. Oceans are [at their **hottest**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/09/profound-impacts-record-ocean-heat-intensifying-climate-disasters) **point in over 1,000 years**, according to [a study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-026-5876-0) published two weeks ago…and [the rate of temperature increase](https://archive.ph/UJZHD) is sharper than previous records. 

An open-source, interactive [**country-by-country methane emissions database**](https://carboninversion.com/) and [**map**](https://worldwidemethaneemissions.com/) was released, along with [an accompanying study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67122-8) last month. The researchers determined that “global anthropogenic emissions to be 15% higher than UNFCCC reporting (32% for oil-gas), with national emissions more than 50% higher than reporting for a quarter of the countries.”

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-03094-3) on the U.S. [Water Table](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/water-table/)—the “underground boundary between the soil surface and the area where groundwater saturates spaces between sediments and cracks in rock”—concluded that “there is ~306,500 km³ of groundwater over North America.” 

Scholarship into the Collapse of China’s Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) [indicates](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-03038-x) that “recurrent flooding and prolonged droughts, combined with an **unsustainable shift in crop production** from drought-tolerant millet to less resilient wheat and rice, led to harvest failures and food shortages during the cooler and drier climatic conditions of the late 9th and early 10th centuries CE. **Intensifying raiding from competing polities and climatic extremes** further affected grain supplies for the late Tang’s northern military frontier and partly contributed to the sudden decline of the dynasty.” The study looked in particular at changing precipitation & temperature patterns and the second- and third-order effects that a cooler & drier region had on the stability of the Tang imperial dynasty.

Arctic [sea ice hit its **2nd lowest on record**](https://bsky.app/profile/zacklabe.com/post/3mckbks4c4c2o), reportedly down about 420,000 km2 over the last decade—equivalent to twice the size of the island of Great Britain. A [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-026-5876-0) placed ocean warming rates “as the third-warmest year on record.”

Some forecasters are [calling the beginning of the end of La Nina](https://fox40.com/news/national-and-world-news/signs-of-el-nino-as-la-nina-starts-to-fade/?nxsparam=10), which will move into **El Nino** and warmer global temperatures for 9-12 months. Data from Istanbul (metro pop: 16M) indicate [2025 was their highest water usage year](https://www.dailysabah.com/turkiye/istanbul/istanbul-sets-all-time-water-use-record-as-water-stress-increases/amp) on record. [**Flooding in South Africa and Mozambique**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/16/weather-tracer-extreme-rainfall-inundates-south-africa-mozambique-flood-warning) has [killed 100+ people](https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-mozambique-flooding-weather-1e22c38611b1c8aba3ce4f9cf37ab9df). Spain’s meterologists are reportedly being [increasingly subjected to verbal abuse](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/15/spain-climate-scientists-subjected-alarming-rise-hate-speech-minister-warns) pressuring them to not speak out about the dangers of climate change now and in the future.

Gold [hit a **new high**](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/gold-silver-hit-record-highs-on-safe-haven-demand-fed-rate-cut-bets.html) on Monday, at over $4,600 USD per troy ounce. Some observers think “**resource nationalism**” will [push gold above $5,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/14/silver-gold-price-record-100-5000-export-us-china.html) this year, and pull silver up to record prices. 

[Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S3051060025000289?via%3Dihub) on microplastics found that heat—expecially heat above 30 °C (86 °F)—was a trigger for **the release of MPs** in hundreds of polyethylene-coated single-use coffee cups. Especially for entirely-plastic cups, heat released about 33% more MPs. 

A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396425005560) on Long COVID found an association between severity of **neurocognitive difficulties** (brain fog, headaches, etc) **and future likelihood of neurodegenerative illnesses**. A family history of cancer [may also correlate](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/family-history-cancer-linked-increased-risk-long-covid) with Long COVID symptoms. A [study](https://ufhealth.org/news/2026/study-lost-wages-from-long-covid-total-12-7-billion-in-just-one-year-2) on Long COVID’s financial toll in the U.S. calculated money losses (due to sick days from COVID) at **$12.7B**. The research unfortunately does not strive to report how many people came to work with COVID, infecting others.

U.S. professors are [sounding the alarm](https://archive.ph/ZwnbC) over functionally **illiterate freshmen entering universities** in growing numbers. Many who can read cannot handle complex sentences, or they get winded reading several pages. Some [40% of Americans didn’t read one book](https://archive.ph/PlXkS) in 2025. The [**attention crisis** has come to cinema](https://variety.com/2026/film/news/matt-damon-netflix-movies-restate-plot-viewers-on-phones-1236633939/) as well. The [unveiling of “ChatGPT Health”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/15/chatgpt-health-ai-chatbot-medical-advice) in Australia has people worried about loosely regulated **misinformation presented as facts**. Grok AI is [being integrated](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/hegseth-wants-to-integrate-musks-grok-ai-into-military-networks-this-month/) into the Pentagon’s intelligence network later this month, according to U.S. officials…

A [paywalled study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-025-00379-8) on the global construction industry concluded that “construction emissions are converging around 1–3 metric tons of CO2 equivalents (tCO2e) per capita per year—a level that **could use up most or all emissions allowed by a 2 °C climate target in 2030**.” Saudi Arabia’s ambitious project, The Line, [appears to have officially ended](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/the-line-neom-saudi-vision-2030/), at great financial & human expense; there is almost nothing to show for it. 

The [proliferation of strange betting markets](https://archive.ph/sJ0LO) has commodified news, and is creating gambling addicts desperate to bet on anything—and what happens when they try to ensure their odd predictions pan out in reality? Meanwhile, deep in the Amazon, a [group of **uncontacted tribespeople** were spotted](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15470957/footage-hunters-uncontacted-Amazon-tribe.html), marking their first known introduction to the modern world; how many years before they get their first smartphone? As Iran’s protests move on, the [country may **cut its people off from the Internet**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/17/iran-plans-permanent-break-from-global-internet-say-activists) for a long time, granting access only to a privileged few. 

The [**pathology of the polycrisis**](https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2026/jan/14/new-year-polycrisis-psychology-feeling-trapped) has destabilized **mental health**, abilities to predict the future, and personal preparation efforts. Anxiety has spiked. Brains are hijacked. And the human brain cannot easily navigate the complex reality in which we are trapped. 

**Nurdle**: “tiny, lentil-sized (2-5mm) pre-production plastic pellets used as the raw material to manufacture nearly all plastic goods.” Larger than most microplastics, [nurdles are contaminating beaches](https://phys.org/news/2026-01-plastic-pellets-nurdles-polluting-beaches.html) in particular, to such an extent that they are almost becoming one with the sand. Over **440,000 metric tonnes of nurdles** are believed to find their way into the oceans each year. Meanwhile, [an article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/13/microplastics-human-body-doubt) in *The Guardian* raises doubt on previous studies reporting alarming concentrations of microplastics throughout the human body; perhaps the problem is not quite so widespread as believed. Or maybe Big Plastic/Petroleum is just [trying to keep doing business](https://old.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1qc8ju8/a_bombshell_doubt_cast_on_discovery_of/nzgg1cu/) as usual. A [study](https://www.earth.com/news/people-inhale-very-high-levels-of-microplastics-simply-by-breathing-city-air/) from China says that the number of microplastics inhaled by people tripled during the course of their 5-year study; “[**plastic clouds**](https://archive.ph/AyOst)” were detected above two large Chinese cities as part of the study.

A [**chronic malnutrition crisis**](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.ca/chad-malnutrition-is-a-silent-crisis/) in Chad is worsening, according to *Medicins Sans Frontieres*. According to 2025 data, [France recorded more deaths than births](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260113-deaths-overtake-births-france-first-time-since-world-war-ii) in 2025. 

Despite American tariffs, China’s trade surplus in 2025 [hit record highs](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/14/china-reports-record-trillion-dollar-trade-surplus-despite-trump-tariffs) at $1.189T, if you believe the data. Chinese automobiles (particularly EVs) had large growth in 2025. 

The World Economic Forum (WEF) released its 102-page [**Global Risks Report**](https://reports.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risks_Report_2026.pdf) for 2026, characterizing the world as on **the precipice of something extreme and terrible**. They suggest we may tip over the edge in the coming 10 years, due to a number of risks: AI unbound, competing values at home and abroad, structural risks to critical infrastructure, economic inequalities and potential crashes, and the rise of multipolarity—to name a few. The report’s images are more illuminating than its text.

>“**Geoeconomic confrontation** has emerged as the most severe risk over the next two years while economic risks have experienced the sharpest rises among all risk categories over the two-year timeframe….**technological acceleration**, while driving unprecedented opportunities, is also generating significant risks in the form of misinformation and disinformation….**Uncertainty** is the defining theme of the global risks outlook in 2026….Rising **societal and political polarization** is intensifying pressures on democratic systems, as extremist social, cultural and political movements challenge institutional resilience and public trust….As a unipolar world shifts towards a more **multipolar** one, a new competitive order is emerging….Deep funding cuts at many international institutions are leading to a retrenchment of development and aid activities…..There is currently widespread concern around elevated equity prices for the largest technology companies, and 2025 saw periods of frenzied investor interest not only in artificial intelligence (AI)- related stocks, but also in sectors such as nuclear, quantum or rare earths….it has been estimated that **the power needed by AI data centres in the United States alone could rise 30 times within the next decade**….much of the critical infrastructure in OECD countries, such as transport networks, power grids and water systems, was built in the initial post-World War II decades and will require costly maintenance and upgrading….” -selections from the first 50 pages

Gaza has [entered the second phase](https://archive.ph/YVBav) of the peace deal, where Hamas must disarm. The difficulty is that Hamas—which some observers believe has actually **grown in size after October 7th**, due to Palestinian backlash to IDF operations—doesn’t want to unilaterally give up its weapons without credible assurances of statehood; Hamas is said not to have a role in the future government of Gaza… The [ceasefire between Israel-Hamas has also been broken](https://archive.ph/jXtGB) many times over, and will continue to see **violations** in the months ahead. 

Widespread [delays, glitches, and irregularities](https://archive.ph/reDmz) were reported across Uganda during their election, in which their corrupt octogenarian president sought, [and won](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/17/yoweri-museveni-wins-ugandan-election-as-opponent-condemns-fake-result), his seventh term in power; [**repressions**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/15/uganda-vote-election-yoweri-museveni-bobi-wine) were manifold, and **hundreds of protestors arrested**. Ethiopia’s President claims that [Eritrea was sending weapons](https://archive.ph/qu9Vn) to rebel forces in Ethiopia in an attempt to foment conflict within Ethiopia (pop: 139M). Donald Trump has [once again threatened](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/trump-insurrection-act-minnesota-ice-protests) to invoke the **Insurrection Act**, following protests against ongoing ICE operations in Minneapolis (pop: 428,000). Some [1,500 soldiers are on standby](https://archive.ph/lhkAZ) to potentially be flown in from Alaska to bolster security forces in Minnesota, should Trump decide to activate them. 

As the world shifts harder into multipolarity and disorder, some [countries are **stockpiling food**](https://archive.ph/qctgP) and other resources (like oil and fertilizer) in advance of a potential crisis—a War, a blockade, tariffs, or simply the simultaneous failure of key breadbaskets. The U.S. [seized another oil tanker](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/venezuela-oil-tanker-trump-us-seized) in the Caribbean linked to Venezuela. Bolivia [**declared an emergency**](https://buenosairesherald.com/world/latin-america/bolivia-declares-energy-and-social-emergency-after-widespread-protests) mostly related to oil shortages, but also currency shortages and weeks of resultant protests. 

A [crane fell down onto a train](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/14/thailand-train-crane-accident-deaths) in Thailand, killing 32+, and hospitalizing at least twice as many. The incident is unrelated to [Thailand’s War with Cambodia](https://www.trtworld.com/article/c3b28e5f1524), in which Thai forces are reportedly squatting on locations in Cambodia, having **displaced some 4,000 Cambodians**. [Hearings began at the ICJ](https://news.sky.com/story/myanmar-accused-of-genocide-against-rohingya-minority-in-landmark-un-case-13493404) concerning charges of genocide against Myanmar’s government, for its role in persecuting its Rohingya minority. The U.S. [labeled the Muslim Bortherhood](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/13/us-labels-muslim-brotherhood-orgs-in-egypt-lebanon-jordan-as-terrorist) as a terror group operating in several Middle Eastern nations.

[**Ongoing fighting**](https://www.dw.com/en/syria-no-end-to-conflict-between-kurds-central-government/a-75506075) between Syrians and Kurdish Syrians is threatening the stability—and oil supplies—of Syria’s oil-rich northeast. Syrian government forces [appear to have made gains](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/18/syrian-army-surges-into-kurdish-held-towns-in-betrayal-shattering-hopes-of-accord) in the country’s north. 

Some [sources](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202601130145?source=share-link) claim 12,000 people had been killed as part of Iran’s regime cracking down on growing protests across the country early last week. Later in the week the [number rose to **16,500**](https://archive.ph/wWZJ7). The orders allegedly [came from the Ayatollah](https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/01/13/iran-protests-massacre-report-12000-dead/) himself. President Trump was/is [said to be considering military action](https://archive.ph/HZqNR) in Iran; urgent negotiations [defused what could have been](https://archive.ph/pyqV2) an overthrow of the regime. The U.S. government [claims](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-883473) Iran’s leaders are wiring out tens of millions of dollars in anticipation of a potential regime Collapse. Some say [the **protests are partially driven by water shortages**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/15/how-day-zero-water-shortages-in-iran-are-fuelling-protests). 

As nighttime temperatures in Kyiv hit -20 °C (-4 °F), President Zelenskyy [declared a state of emergency](https://archive.ph/1LnM0) for Ukraine’s energy sector, a longtime target of Russian air strikes—like [last week’s attacks on Odesa](https://archive.ph/gcqNF).

I wonder what’s going to be different about today.

Everyone starts off their day with a fixed set of actions. Still, there are variables that can change our preferred sequence of events. A call you weren’t expecting. Someone who only drinks tea, forgot to buy coffee for his partner on his last grocery run. Freshly out of bed, she has seen him drink tea out of her favorite coffee cup. He hasn’t noticed that it’s her cup or that there’s no coffee. What is it that tips the scale and makes you fall in love with someone?

I’ve got issues with good dreams. Once you wake up you have to reconcile with reality. You’re confused, in doubt and often disappointed. The bad one’s can be shrugged off with: *that was just a dream.*

Recently i had a revelation. Smartphones are a part of our digestive system. Screens have laxative effects. Some of us just can’t take a shit without our phone. 

I brush my teeth every day. But sometimes I go through a strange day where this well understood instruction goes rogue. And only after a couple of nights would I recollect that I didn’t brush my teeth. I can’t remember when it first happened or what triggers it.

1qgdpdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewportNews/comments/1qgdpdt/hello_rnewportnews_lets_have_a_chat_about_where/,"Hello, /r/NewportNews! Let's have a chat about where our subreddit is and what we want it to be! Your participation is humbly requested and desired.","Hi! I've just recently been added as a moderator by u/rpfail, and we've been talking about some ideas for the subreddit.

The shortest version: We want to make this place a great community for our city, and for you: The members of this subreddit.

We're going to be working on enhancing the subreddit. For a start, I'm working on adding post flair so that hopefully most posts can be categorized - this makes it easier, for example, to find all the restaurant reviews if we have a flair for that. Or when someone posts a ""Hey, I'm moving here and have questions"", we can make it easy to load the list of ""Moving Here"" posts so they can, in addition to posting their unique questions, easily find previous threads with previous answers.

I also will continue to post news that pops up.

But we also want to get more involvement from local organizations. For example, I think it would be awesome to invote our local musems, theatres, and event venues to keep us up to date on what's happening with them. And hopefully have someone from the organization come interact with us. They get ""free advertising"", but we get to find out what's going on in our city, and especially if they come participate here, I think it'd be awesome to be able to ask them questions and just talk to them.

I also want to see more things like the recent review of Queen's Hot Chicken - good reviews by locals of local places. And I want to talk to those places and see if they want to come make a very very occasional post (if they also agree to come participate here). Interacting with our awesome local places would be awesome.

And we want to be able to encourage meetups and social gatherings. It's harder and harder to make friends these days, so it would be delightful to see some groups spring up - like meetups at coffee places or bars or restaurants, or maybe DND groups or pokemon stuff, or people who want to work out together or bike together — or whatever works out.

We're small, but both of us want to work to bring more content into here, and I think that will help us grow a bit larger.

I think our current mod has done a pretty good job of running the place, but it's time to step up and make it into a growing community that can make it an even better place.

What I'd also love to see is, as the community grows, some community members stepping up to help. Like if someone keeps up with, say, where local bands are playing and posts upcoming events. Whatever the nature of the contribution to the community, we'd love to see what works out.

And beyond that, I intend to have occasional (possibly monthly) ""meta' threads like this one - to talk to you about what's working, what's not working, what we want to see more of, what we can do to make things run better.

Now bear in mind that we won't all agree, but I believe in moderating by consensus as much as possible. And also bear in mind we can't make things like ""Less posts on X topic"" because the community decides what to post.

Our job as moderators is to remove the posts and comments that break the rules and community guidelines. Your job as the community is to upvote and downvote what you think should be here.

And we want to keep the rules as simple as possible. In fact, the one single rule that rules them all is this:

RULE: Don't be a dick.

It all boils down to that. Being racist? You're being a dick. Making personal attacks? You're being a dick. Spamming with your unsolicited commercial posts? You're being a dick.

One final bit for now: After talking with rpfail, I think we're on the same page about moderation. If we do something that you disagree with, please feel free to contact us to discuss it. If you are polite and respectful, we'll be polite and respectful back. Glad to take a second look at anything we do. Maybe we made a mistake - glad to undo that mistake when it happens! We're human, ya know. And if we disagree - well, if you're polite we'll be polite right back, and I apologize for the disagreement, but hopefully we can figure out how to get along. But if you are a dick, we'll shut you down if we have to. But I hate doing that. I'd rather have a dialogue and find common ground when it's possible.

So we'll also put some comments down here with some other ideas we have, but the important thing: What do you want this subreddit to be? What do you think about some of the ideas so far? Do you have any ideas? Do you want to contribute? Please speak up!",8,1768755269.0,NewportNews,13,0.75,False
1qgdoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoverMadeEasy/comments/1qgdoul/best_insurance_for_students_studying_abroad/,Best Insurance for Students Studying Abroad,"Picture this: you're two weeks into your semester in Barcelona when you wake up with excruciating stomach pain at 3 AM. Your roommate calls an ambulance. The hospital wants payment upfront. Your U.S. insurance card? Worthless here. That €2,500 emergency room bill? All yours—unless you made one smart decision before you left.

Study abroad insurance isn't the exciting part of planning your semester in Europe or gap year in Southeast Asia. Nobody fantasizes about policy details while browsing Instagram photos of the Eiffel Tower. But that €2,500 bill can turn into €15,000 fast if you need surgery or hospitalization. And trust me, you don't want to be figuring this out while doubled over in pain in a foreign country.

# ✅ Quick Answer: Best Student Insurance at a Glance

For most students studying abroad, **SafetyWing Nomad Insurance** offers the best balance of affordability and coverage at around $56 per month. If you need comprehensive coverage including routine care and pre-existing conditions, **GeoBlue Navigator** provides unlimited medical coverage but costs $426-$517 monthly.

**International Student Insurance** plans start at just $29/month and meet visa requirements, making them ideal for international students coming to the U.S.

# Why Your Regular Insurance Won't Cut It

Your parents' health insurance back home? It probably stops at the border. I've talked to dozens of students who assumed they were covered, only to discover the hard way that their domestic plan offers zero international coverage—or covers only emergencies at astronomical out-of-pocket costs.

Here's what most student insurance plans DON'T cover abroad:

* Routine medical care
* Emergency room visits (or charge massive deductibles)
* Medical evacuation (which can cost $100,000+)
* Prescription medications
* Mental health services

And if you're an international student heading to the U.S.? You absolutely need coverage. American healthcare costs are legendary for all the wrong reasons. A single ER visit averages $2,200 before any actual treatment.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Many universities require proof of insurance before you can enroll. Don't wait until the last minute—some policies take days or even weeks to process, especially if they require medical underwriting.

# Top 5 Student Travel Insurance Options Compared

I've reviewed dozens of student insurance policies, and these five consistently deliver the best value for different student situations.

|Insurance|Best For|Price (3 months)|Medical Coverage|Deductible|Pre-existing Conditions|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**SafetyWing Essential**|Budget travelers|\~$168|$250,000|$250|❌ Not covered|
|**GeoBlue Navigator**|Comprehensive coverage|$1,278-$1,551|Unlimited|$0-$2,500 options|✅ With proof of prior coverage|
|**International Student Insurance**|U.S. visa requirements|\~$87+|Varies by plan|Varies|Some plans cover after waiting period|
|**Heymondo Premium**|Zero deductible preference|\~$339|Up to $5 million|$0|❌ Not covered|
|**World Nomads**|Adventure activities|\~$661|Up to $5 million|Varies|Limited acute onset coverage|

# 1. SafetyWing Nomad Insurance Essential: Best Budget Option

**Monthly cost**: $56.28 (ages 18-39) **Coverage limit**: $250,000 emergency medical **Deductible**: $250 per incident

SafetyWing built their reputation with digital nomads, but students have caught on. The subscription model works perfectly for study abroad—no need to guess how long you'll be gone, no locked-in end dates.

# What It Covers

* Emergency medical treatment up to $250,000
* Emergency evacuation up to $100,000
* Emergency dental up to $1,000
* Lost checked luggage up to $3,000
* Home country coverage (30 days after 90 days abroad; 15 days for U.S. residents)
* Trip delay compensation ($100/day, max 2 days)

# What It Doesn't Cover

This is where SafetyWing shows its budget-friendly nature:

* No trip cancellation coverage
* No routine doctor visits or preventive care
* Pre-existing conditions excluded completely
* Limited coverage in the U.S. (requires add-on)
* Age limit of 69

|✅ **Pros**|❌ **Cons**|
|:-|:-|
|Can purchase while already abroad|$250 deductible per claim|
|Flexible monthly subscriptions|No trip cancellation|
|Coverage in 180+ countries|No routine medical care|
|Fast claims (typically 21 days)|Pre-existing conditions excluded|
|Simple 5-minute signup|Limited U.S. coverage without add-on|

🎯 **Bottom Line**: If you're a healthy student on a tight budget who needs emergency coverage for a semester or year abroad, SafetyWing delivers solid protection. Just know you're covered for emergencies only, not routine healthcare.

# 2. GeoBlue Navigator Student: Best Comprehensive Coverage

**Monthly cost**: $426-$517 (varies by age and deductible) **Coverage limit**: Unlimited medical **Deductible**: $0, $250, $500, $1,000, or $2,500 options

GeoBlue (now Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Solutions) is the heavyweight option. Unlimited medical coverage. No waiting periods for preventive care. Pre-existing condition coverage with proof of prior insurance.

The catch? That price tag.

# What It Covers

* Unlimited annual and lifetime medical maximum
* Emergency medical evacuation up to $250,000
* Preventive care with no waiting period
* Mental health services
* Prescription medications
* Pre-existing conditions (with proof of prior creditable coverage)
* Dental and vision benefits available
* Maternity coverage (after 364 days of continuous coverage)

# The Fine Print

This is medical insurance, not just travel insurance. You're paying for comprehensive healthcare coverage, which explains the higher cost. The plan requires medical underwriting—you'll answer health questions and wait for approval, which can take 60-75 days.

|✅ **Pros**|❌ **Cons**|
|:-|:-|
|Unlimited medical coverage|Expensive ($426-$517/month)|
|Covers pre-existing conditions|Requires medical underwriting|
|Preventive care included|60-75 day approval process|
|Meets J-1 visa requirements|3-month minimum stay required|
|BlueCross BlueShield network in U.S.|Must be enrolled in educational activity|

💰 **Money-Saving Tip**: If you have proof of prior health insurance for at least 6 months, you can get simplified underwriting and immediate coverage for pre-existing conditions. Without it, you'll wait 6-12 months for pre-existing condition coverage to kick in.

🎯 **Bottom Line**: GeoBlue is overkill for a healthy student doing one semester abroad. But if you have ongoing health issues, need comprehensive coverage, or are studying in the U.S. where healthcare costs are astronomical, the unlimited medical coverage justifies the price.

# 3. International Student Insurance (ISI): Best for Visa Requirements

**Monthly cost**: Starting at $29 **Coverage limit**: Varies by plan level **Deductible**: Varies by plan

ISI specializes in one thing: getting international students the coverage they need to satisfy visa and university requirements. They offer multiple plan levels (Elite, Select, Budget, Smart) so you can match your budget to your needs.

# What Makes ISI Different

These plans are specifically designed to meet student visa requirements, particularly for F-1 and J-1 visa holders studying in the U.S. The company focuses exclusively on international students, so their customer service understands visa rules, university requirements, and the specific concerns students face.

# Coverage Highlights

* Medical coverage varies by plan level
* Emergency services and hospitalization
* Prescription medications
* Mental health support
* Repatriation coverage
* Pre-existing conditions covered after waiting period (Elite and Select: 6 months; Budget: 12 months; Smart: not covered)
* Home country coverage (15 days per 3 months of coverage)

⚠️ **Important**: ISI's plans are built around U.S. visa requirements first, coverage second. If you're studying outside the U.S., you'll find better options with SafetyWing or Heymondo.

🏥 **Coverage Note**: The Budget and Smart plans have significantly lower coverage limits than Elite and Select. For students in high-cost countries (especially the U.S.), the cheapest plan might not provide adequate protection.

# 4. Heymondo Premium: Best Zero-Deductible Option

**Cost for 3 months**: \~$339 **Coverage limit**: Up to $5 million medical **Deductible**: $0

Heymondo positions itself as the anti-SafetyWing: higher price, higher coverage, zero deductible. That $0 deductible matters more than you'd think.

# Why Zero Deductible Matters

With SafetyWing's $250 deductible, you pay the first $250 of every claim. Get sick twice during your semester? That's $500 out of pocket. Heymondo's $0 deductible means you don't pay anything before coverage kicks in.

Plus, Heymondo offers a 24/7 traveler assistance app that helps you find doctors and arranges direct billing—you never pay out of pocket and file for reimbursement.

# Coverage Highlights

* Emergency medical up to $5 million
* Trip cancellation and interruption coverage
* Baggage loss up to $3,000
* Electronic equipment coverage (huge for students with laptops)
* 24/7 multilingual assistance
* Medical expenses paid upfront (no reimbursement hassle)

# The Limitations

No pre-existing condition coverage. No home country coverage. And you'll need to purchase before your trip starts—can't buy it while already abroad like you can with SafetyWing.

|✅ **Pros**|❌ **Cons**|
|:-|:-|
|$0 deductible|Higher cost than SafetyWing|
|Medical bills paid upfront|No pre-existing condition coverage|
|Covers electronic equipment|Must purchase before departure|
|Trip cancellation included|Age limit of 49|
|24/7 assistance app|No home country coverage|

# 5. World Nomads: Best for Adventure Activities

**Cost for 3 months**: \~$661 **Coverage limit**: Up to $5 million **Deductible**: Varies by plan

If your study abroad includes adventure sports—scuba diving in Thailand, skiing in the Alps, surfing in Australia—World Nomads covers activities that make other insurers nervous.

The Standard and Explorer plans differ mainly in coverage limits and adventure activity lists. The Explorer plan costs more but covers a wider range of high-risk activities.

# Adventure Coverage

World Nomads automatically includes coverage for activities like:

* Trekking and hiking
* Scuba diving (to 40 meters)
* Skiing and snowboarding
* Surfing and kitesurfing
* Bungee jumping
* Zip-lining
* Mountain biking

SafetyWing requires a $10/month add-on for similar coverage. Heymondo covers some adventure activities but not all.

# The Trade-offs

World Nomads is expensive. Like, really expensive. That \~$661 for three months is nearly four times SafetyWing's cost. You're paying for that adventure coverage and higher medical limits.

Also, trip-based pricing means you need to know your exact dates upfront. Extending coverage mid-trip is possible but complicated.

⚠️ **Important**: Read the activity list carefully. ""Scuba diving"" is covered; ""scuba diving below 40 meters"" isn't. ""Skiing on marked trails"" is covered; ""skiing off-piste"" might not be.

# What About School-Offered Insurance?

Many universities offer their own student health plans or recommend specific providers. Should you take them?

Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

After reviewing dozens of university-recommended plans, here's what I've found: they're often overpriced for what they cover. Universities partner with specific insurers and sometimes get kickbacks. The coverage might be adequate, but you're probably paying more than necessary.

**When to choose school insurance:**

* Your university requires their specific plan (some do)
* The coverage includes on-campus health services you'll actually use
* You have pre-existing conditions and the school plan covers them
* The price is competitive with market alternatives

**When to skip it:**

* You can find equivalent coverage cheaper elsewhere
* The plan has low coverage limits ($50,000-$100,000)
* High deductibles ($500-$1,000)
* Coverage only works on or near campus

Always compare the school plan against SafetyWing or Heymondo. Run the numbers. Often you'll find better coverage for less money.

# Visa and University Requirements: What You Actually Need

Different countries and universities have wildly different insurance requirements. Mess this up and you might not get your visa or be allowed to enroll.

# Common Requirements

**Schengen Visa (Europe):**

* Minimum €30,000 ($35,000) medical coverage
* Valid in all Schengen countries
* Coverage for emergency evacuation and repatriation
* Zero waiting periods

SafetyWing, Heymondo, and World Nomads all meet these requirements. GeoBlue exceeds them significantly.

**U.S. F-1/J-1 Visa:**

* Minimum $100,000 medical coverage per accident/illness
* $25,000 repatriation coverage
* $50,000 medical evacuation
* Maximum $500 deductible (for J-1)

GeoBlue Navigator and ISI plans specifically meet J-1 requirements. SafetyWing's $250 deductible qualifies, but the $250,000 limit exceeds minimums by a comfortable margin.

**UK Student Visa:** Students staying over six months get NHS coverage through the Immigration Health Surcharge. You'll still want supplemental insurance for things NHS doesn't cover immediately (dental, prescriptions, mental health).

📌 **Key Takeaway**: Always verify your specific visa and university requirements before purchasing. Email the international student office and get requirements in writing. ""I thought I was covered"" doesn't work at customs.

# The Claims Process: What Actually Happens When You Get Sick

Theory is great. Coverage details matter. But what happens when you're actually sick or injured abroad?

I've walked dozens of students through filing claims. Here's the reality.

# The SafetyWing Experience

1. Go to the doctor/hospital and pay out of pocket
2. Keep all receipts and medical documentation
3. Log into SafetyWing dashboard and upload documents
4. Wait 21 days (typically) for reimbursement
5. Money appears in your account

The $250 deductible applies to each ""certificate period"" (28 days). Get sick in September and again in October? Two separate deductibles.

# The GeoBlue Experience

1. Find an in-network provider through their app
2. Provider bills GeoBlue directly (you pay nothing upfront)
3. If out-of-network, pay and file for reimbursement
4. Claims processed within standard timeframes

The direct billing is huge. Not carrying €2,000 to a Spanish ER in cash makes a real difference.

# The Heymondo Experience

1. Contact 24/7 assistance through the app
2. They direct you to a nearby doctor
3. Heymondo arranges direct payment
4. You pay $0 out of pocket

This is Heymondo's selling point. No reimbursement waiting game, no upfront cash needed.

📋 **Claim Tip**: Take photos of everything. Receipts fade. Medical reports get lost. Your phone won't. Photograph every document, receipt, and prescription. Upload them immediately. Future you will be grateful when the claim process is smooth because you have perfect documentation.

# How Much Should You Budget?

Let's break down real costs for typical study abroad scenarios.

**One Semester (4 months) in Europe:**

* SafetyWing: $225
* Heymondo: $452
* World Nomads: $881
* GeoBlue: $1,704-$2,068

**Full Academic Year (9 months) in Asia:**

* SafetyWing: $506
* Heymondo: $1,017
* World Nomads: $1,982
* GeoBlue: $3,834-$4,653

**International Student in U.S. (12 months):**

* ISI (Budget): $348+
* ISI (Elite): $800+
* SafetyWing (with U.S. add-on): \~$900
* GeoBlue: $5,112-$6,204

These numbers assume you're 18-25 and in good health. Older students or those needing higher coverage limits will pay more.

# Special Situations and Edge Cases

# Gap Year Students

You're not technically studying abroad—you're traveling and maybe doing some coursework. SafetyWing is perfect here. The month-to-month subscription adapts to your changing plans.

# Students with Chronic Conditions

GeoBlue Navigator is your best (maybe only) real option. That unlimited medical coverage and pre-existing condition coverage is worth the cost when you have ongoing health needs.

# Students Going to Multiple Countries

SafetyWing covers 180+ countries under one policy. No need to buy separate coverage for your semester in Spain and your spring break in Morocco.

# Students Planning to Work or Intern

Check if your insurance covers paid work or internships. Some policies exclude coverage during paid employment. SafetyWing's Complete plan might work better here.

# Students Over 50

Most budget options age out or get expensive. GeoBlue covers up to age 74. World Nomads stops at 70.

# Red Flags: Insurance to Avoid

Not all student insurance is created equal. Watch for these warning signs:

🚩 **Coverage limits under $100,000**: Healthcare is expensive. $50,000 might sound like a lot until you need surgery and three days in a hospital.

🚩 **Deductibles over $500**: You're a student. You probably don't have $1,000+ sitting around to pay before insurance kicks in.

🚩 **No emergency evacuation**: Medical evacuation from remote areas can cost $100,000+. This coverage isn't optional.

🚩 **U.S.-only customer service**: When you're sick in Japan, do you want to navigate time zones and language barriers to file a claim?

🚩 **Poor online reviews with similar complaints**: One bad review is an outlier. Fifty reviews mentioning denied claims or impossible-to-reach customer service? Pattern.

# Making Your Decision

Here's my honest take after reviewing all these options:

**Choose SafetyWing if:**

* You're a healthy student under 40
* You're studying for one semester to one year
* You need emergency coverage, not comprehensive healthcare
* You're on a tight budget
* You might extend your stay and want flexibility

**Choose GeoBlue if:**

* You have pre-existing conditions
* You're studying in the U.S.
* You need comprehensive healthcare, not just emergency coverage
* You want unlimited medical coverage
* You can afford $400+/month for peace of mind

**Choose ISI if:**

* You're an international student coming to the U.S.
* You need to meet specific F-1 or J-1 visa requirements
* You want multiple plan levels to match your budget
* You value customer service that understands student visa situations

**Choose Heymondo if:**

* You want zero deductible
* You prefer medical bills paid upfront
* You're carrying expensive electronics
* You want trip cancellation coverage
* You can't buy insurance until close to departure

**Choose World Nomads if:**

* Your semester includes serious adventure activities
* You're doing a program with significant outdoor components
* You need the highest medical coverage limits
* Budget isn't your primary concern

# The Bottom Line

For most students heading abroad for a semester or year, SafetyWing offers the best value at around $56/month. It's not perfect—that $250 deductible and lack of trip cancellation coverage are real limitations. But for emergency medical protection, it delivers what matters at a price students can actually afford.

Got ongoing health issues? Spend the extra money on GeoBlue. That unlimited medical coverage and pre-existing condition protection is worth every dollar when you need it.

International student heading to the U.S.? Start with ISI's plan selector and choose the level that meets both your visa requirements and your budget.

Whatever you choose, don't skip insurance. That €2,500 emergency room bill I mentioned at the start? That's the cheap scenario. Hospitalization, surgery, or medical evacuation can bankrupt you.

I love getting up and having my coffee, standing outside while the dog does her business, reading the newspaper (I know, I'm a thousand years old, I still get a physical paper on the weekends) and most importantly, being alert & happy when my kids get out of bed and want some breakfast. 

  
I've been lucky enough to live in some amazing cities in my life and it makes me sad to think how many of these mornings I wasted hungover and glued to a couch. I'd lose whole weekends recovering from big nights out and/or trying to rally for the next big night out. I've always felt that life is about the people you meet and the experiences you have. That thinking helped me justify the never-ending big nights out. And it was true...to a point. Until those nights became my ONLY experiences and the ONLY way I was experiencing the place I lived and the people in it. 

  
So I'm really happy to be in this new stage of life, connecting with the morning and carpe-ing the full diem, not just the end of it.",9,1768755208.0,stopdrinking,3,1.0,False

Being with you during those hours felt natural, unforced, and genuinely peaceful.

**I miss how you knew all my favorites**, like you had memorized every little detail about me without me even having to say it twice. You remembered my favorite color, the little things that made me smile, even the exact in-game skins I loved using, the ones I would pick without thinking. It felt like you paid attention to everything that mattered to me, like you were collecting pieces of me just by being present. And it wasn’t just the small stuff, it was the care behind remembering, the way you’d mention things at the right time, like you wanted me to feel seen and understood. I miss that more than I can say, the quiet way you made me feel like I wasn’t just a player in your game, but someone you genuinely cared about, someone whose little quirks and preferences mattered enough for you to keep track of.

You were never disrespectful to me. Whenever a joke crossed a line or leaned toward something inappropriate, you would immediately say, “Bad yan” and shut it down without hesitation. Even my friends never had anything negative to say about you or the way you played. You carried yourself with decency and restraint, and that made me feel respected in ways I didn’t even realize I needed at the time. It was easy to trust you because you never made me feel small or uncomfortable.

I miss the way you used to present everything to me with so much enthusiasm, the way you talked about what you loved in the game, the things you wanted to do next, and the goals you were quietly proud of. I miss hearing you explain your peak, how you reached it, and the confidence in your voice whenever you mentioned it, even when you tried to sound casual. Even the small things stayed with me, your fondness for coffee, the way it seemed to be part of your routine, something steady that matched your focus and patience.

You are so hard to forget, even though I know you no longer care about me. What hurts more is that this pain feels heavier than my past heartbreaks. You were the only one who gave me consistent assurance, who apologized when I communicated that I was hurt and explained why. You listened instead of dismissing my feelings. You were the one who never treated me like an enemy, never made me feel like I had to fight for understanding.

Please help, feel lost","Without getting into entire back story, me (FA) and my ex (FA) got into a very fast paced high intimacy relationship. we were together 4 months total, and in that time I was introduced to her kids, we played “house” meals at her kids, spent Christmas with her and them, said I love you to each other. I got dumped over text on Boxing Day saying it had progressed too quick without a stable base annd she felt overwhelmed so she wanted to end it as it was the right thing for her.

We work together, so we had gone NC since the break up (16 days) as we were working from home during the holiday period but in the office together it felt like the Cold War - so I messaged her at work - Would you like to go for a coffee and clear the air?

She replied back We met straight after work - she was caught of sort of switched off a little bit, but customer servicy. She still couldn't really meet my eyes. And she sat down. Now, it's an L shaped booth, but she's sat next to me at the booth rather than on the table across from me.

She asked me if I'm all right, and I said, yeah, and she said, what do you want to talk about? And I said its starting to get round the office we’ve broken up and it was becoming tense in the office and I wasn’t sure how to handle it. she said she hadn't noticed. She said that it's not like we were friends before we got together andyway. And I said that may be the case, but we have a shared history now,

I explained I have no bad blood between us, I told her I understand why she ended it. she asked me “do you understand”? I replied yes. Like I do but I don't want to get into it unless she wants to. she said she did So I started talking about it, I told her about my reflections in them 2 weeks on how as much as I can tell her that she invited me to these things with the kids, I'm also to blame because I didn't set my own boundaries. I should have told her like I needed to pull away and maybe I don't want to do these things with the kids as muxh and maybe we'll focus on more casual date nights and stuff. And I told her that I also needed space just as much, and I was sort of losing myself to the relationship, like I was blowing off my friends or like not taking time for myself to be with her and the kids because I didn't know how to say no. And it's not like I wasn't enjoying it because I definitely was, but because of that, it just got intense very quickly. And she agreed, and she said she did enjoy it too, and the feelings were real but she also didn’t know how to set her own boundaries either because she was scared if she asked I’d be upset with her , she regretted inviting me to Christmas but didn’t know how to say no, she didn’t know how to communicate she needed space, she was worried I’d spend Christmas alone if she did uninvite, she was people pleasing for me, stretching herself thin, she started to cry. I just reached out for her, and she cried in my into my chest. She snuggled in for a hug and a cry . And then people walked in to the pub, so she stopped hugging me because she felt a bit embarrassed. And I said, look, Obviously, I'm not gonna lie. I still have feelings for you, and the kids, you know, I care about you. And I have up and down days, but I want what's best for both of us. She said she understands, and she said it is what it is, and I say it doesn't have to be.

She was still quietly crying, tears running down her face, I told her that like I would do things differently and this is what I would do. And, you know, I would have my own boundaries. And I said, like, you know, I went hiking and stuff and I realised I've realised during these 2 weeks off, you know, when I've been doing my hobbies and playing my games and seeing my friends that like, these are things I really missed. She said I need somebody who's got less going on in their lives. Somebody can give me more, I said, You are enough for me. You always have been. I want somebody who has their own life. It's just that I need to make sure that I don't collapse into theirs. She didn't really agree or disagree. She said she needs to go see the kids, so we walked out, and we walked outside, and we're talking a bit more. And I'm telling her that, It's not what I want, but it's not about what I want. It's about what's best for us both. I said if we were gonna do it, I'd want to do like a situation ship where it's, there's no labels and we're just going on dates and we're just enjoying it and it's just more kid free time like before it got serious and labels were introduced and she's still crying, she started a bit more of a heavy sob and a sniffle, And she said she just doesn't know if she can. She said that she's just so burnt out at the moment and she thought it was just Christmas, but it's still there. And she's sobbing and she's saying that she feels numb. And she's saying that she's just wearing a mask all the time (And these are things I've never heard her say before in the 4 months I've been with her.) I feel like I really saw an open side of her, you know? And we hugged again.

i told her situationahip is what I would want. I wouldn't want to jump back into a relationship with you straight away as that’s when the problem started And she paused for a minute and then she said she wants to be friends. And I said, if that's what you think's best for us, I can't force any outcomes. And we hugged. And then I said, I think you probably need to get back for the kids. She was still crying, but she left, she got in a car and drove off. 

that was Monday 12th, we saw each other in the office Thursday 15th but the Cold War was back on, it felt awkward as hell! No talk, no hey, just a warm nod of acknowledgement from me as I walked past her desk.

can someone give me thoughts here? Is that it? her eyes are darting away when I see her so I assume she’s peak avoidance/deactivation and likely that vulnerability hang over.

Do I reach out again? Do I leave her be now?

1qgdiuw,https://i.redd.it/qy0kluxa05eg1.jpeg,Recreating Perfection in a Cup,"I've come here in an effort to expand upon an experience I had back in 2020, when I enjoyed the perfect cup of coffee (pictured). it was literally one of the most sublime beverages I'd ever had, with flavors I still hardly believe came from coffee beans.

Based on my homework, the coffee was \*likely\* roasted by Sparrows Coffee, but isn't something they carry anymore. So I just looked for other honey processed medium darks from the same region, ended up ordering a bag from Mokaska.

So with a thrifted Chemex, 1980s Oster Cafe Mill grinder, and stovetop kettle, I set out to retire my Cuisinart. After finishing the bag, I can say my worst pour with the Chemex far exceeds anything I've gotten out of my old coffee machine in 10+ years. It's like all the bitterness is just gone. 

Yet, I can't say there was any real flavor profile to most pours, with the exception of one or two pours which I couldn't consistently replicate.

So my questions are 

\- What tools I still need/ what sort of flavor ROI to expect

\- What other coffee's should I put on the \*to try\* list

\- How intensely can flavors be tasted when really dialed in

\- Do you know what shop is pictured? I could never find it on subsequent trips",2,1768754859.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
1qgdi97,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1qgdi97/the_colonizers_satire/,The Colonizers (Satire),"Our wake divides a vast expanse of shimmering blue sea, empty except for our pursuer, a French ship-of-the-line with all her sails spread.

Too many for this wind, I think, reaching for my coffee.

Through the stern windows, I see puffs of smoke from her bow chasers. One ball falls short, a plume of white water near our stern, the other skips and crashes through the windows.

I feel the heat as it passes a hair’s-breadth from my hand, taking the coffee cup with it.

“Miss Fielding!” I said in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel.

“Sir?” My steward’s concerned face at the door. Her eyes fall to shattered dishes, tablecloth askew, then back to me with something like accusation.

“Another cup please, thank you ma’am,” I say, surprised at the meekness in my tone.

She salutes sullenly and disappears.

In the Navy we’d have keelhauled her, I reflect.

But a smuggling ship is a private venture, crewed by volunteers. My authority stems  from the fact that none of these other sods can lead our ship through a squall on a lee shore, navigate the Sicilian channels, or gauge the precise moment a French 3-decker’s topmast will crack.

Which should be right about…now.

The sailors on deck give a wild cheer as it topples, hanging off French ship’s side in a hopeless confusion of blocks, ropes and sailcloth.

“Too much sail,” I say when Miss Fielding returns with the coffee. She shrugs.

The coffee is hot and strong. I take several triumphant gulps before heading out on deck.

Mr. Blythe turns from the taffrail and approaches. He’s a thin, pale, odd-looking fellow we picked up in Port Mahon; said he needed quiet passage, no papers. With his black coat and iced-over eyes he may as well have “Assassin” tattooed on his forehead.

I focus my telescope on a passing shearwater, hoping my concentration will put him off.

“More trouble, Captain?”

“Almost certainly. In fact, I’d better have a look from the masthead.”

I spring for the rigging and climb on muscle-memory alone, the deck shrinking away beneath my feet.

No sooner had I reached the startled lookout then there came cries from below:

“What’s that lubber doing?”

“Damn fool. He’ll break his neck!”

Peering over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled in the rigging. He’s followed me up, the pragmatical bastard!

Halfway he slips, falling backward with his feet caught in the shrouds, his body swinging with the roll of the ship and a look of pure horror on his face.

Miss Dangerfield was at that moment climbing the opposite rigging with the kettle’s leather strap in her teeth. She hangs it on a ratline, leaps for the backstay and swings across to Mr. Blythe, setting him upright.

“Not like that,” she says, moving his hands from the horizontal ropes to the vertical. “Hold these here. Like so.”

Five minutes later, we pull Mr. Blythe up onto our platform. He at once wraps both arms and legs around the mast, eyes closed and looking quite ridiculous.

“Come sir, open your eyes!” I say. “You’ll not miss the view? It’s quite spectacular.”

Reluctantly, Mr Blythe opens one eye, then the other. His face changes from fear to astonishment, then wonder at the infinite blue rolling away on all sides.

“I’m amazed!” He says, relinquishing his hold. A smile breaks out across his reptilian face. “Amazed!”

“Take my telescope,” I say, unsure why I no longer find him off-putting. “There, to starboard…no sir, starboard…there you are, sir…you can make out the western tip of Formentera.”

“Incredible,” he says, sweeping the glass back and forth.

The kettle makes it’s way up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love.

Suddenly Blythe freezes, the telescope pointing south. “And what are those sleek, shiny vessels coming around the cliffs there? Are they racing?”

It’s as I feared. We’d outrun a French 3-decker, but these harbor police with their American-built flyers are the fastest sailors afloat.

“Baltimore clippers,” I say, tossing my cigar over the side. “Revenue cutters.”

Back in my cabin I make bundle of our ship’s log, bills of laden, port authorizations, and a four-pound cannonball, then toss it through the shattered stern ports.

Miss Fielding appears with my best coat and number one hat, which I don sideways like an old-fashioned commodore. Buckling my sword, I take a new packet of false papers under my arm and stride out.

The cutters are much closer now.

“Inspection!” Hails a voice from the nearest, and my heart drops. Lieutenant Turnbull. “Spill your wind and lie-to under my leeward rail. Under…my…leeward…rail!”

“Fuck their leeward rail,” says Miss Fielding.

The cutters hook on, and Turnbull scampers up the ladder, followed by a score of men with muskets.

“I’m looking for your passenger,” he says.

“Passenger?” I look up and down the deck, quizzical as a cat.

“Come, Captain, that will not do. You know the fellow I’m speaking of: black coat, ill-looking. Spanish passport.”

“Oh, him, yes. We dropped him off in Gibraltar. Between you and me, sir,” lowering my voice, “he had something of the air of a criminal.”

“Indeed?” The lieutenant brought his face closer. “Are you aware sir, that this fellow you’re protecting is a hunter for inquisition?”

I knew it, an assassin! The satisfaction brings a smile before I can stop myself.

“Find it funny, do you?” Turnbull’s face changes color. “Eight pounds a head…thumscrews, the rack…Christ, sir, even you cannot say that don’t strike you as dirty.”

Did he say eight pounds a head? I was crunching numbers before he finished speaking.

“Suppose you find him…I imagine I’ll going along…that is to say, I’d be arrested, too?”

“Summarily,” said Turnbull, “but only as a formality, were you to save us a long search. Three days in the brig at Minorca and you’re back at sea.”

I point upward. “He’s at the masthead. Pray, let me run up and see him down, Lieutenant. He’s apt to fall otherwise.”",2,1768754823.0,flashfiction,2,1.0,False

There are plenty of other groups dedicated to different niches, but generally they take place in South Philly or downtown. As a Northeast Philly resident, I wanted to dedicate this group a bit to the area itself. So, events will generally take place up in the northeast, because we also have many great coffee and bubble tea shops, and you know we has plenty of great food up here. 

The areas of interest and target audience would be around **Mayfair, Rhawnhurst, Upper Pennypack Lexington Park, the Roosevelt Mall, Bustleton Ave, Cottman, etc**. Anywhere within 20 minutes or so of the northeast is up for grabs as an event spot. We've got plenty of restaurants and even some Hot Pot we could check out.

I have some background in tech and job hunting, so I don't mind helping some of the younger folks get started. I'm an OG at heart though so there's not a hard age range in mind for people to join the group. 

  
I want to see what this group can turn into, because I haven't seen anything for the Northeast region. We'll keep the meetups a mix of fun and seriousness as we expand our networks and help each other move towards their goals. Even if your goal is just to hangout in the area, that's a great one to have!

* **A Local Guide:** I know my way around Chinatown, Cheltenham, City Ave, and beyond. If you're looking for the best food in the city, I've got you covered.

It’s more about laughing with the right person , ideally with coffee involved. I’m not looking for drama or anything short-term. I care more about real connections, mutual respect, and good energy.

Working out helps me stay sane, and traveling gives me stories (and good food, always a plus). I actually enjoy talking with people older than me , they usually have better perspective, better humor, and less nonsense.

If you’re easygoing, enjoy honest conversations, and can switch between deeper talks and just joking around, we’ll probably vibe. Life’s too short to argue over small stuff. I just want to enjoy it and be happy.",2,1768754732.0,MakeFriendsOver30,3,1.0,False

I drink exclusively light roast coffees (a mix of everything - washed, naturals, coferments, decafs).  
  
I've absolutely loved the oxo rapid brewer, typically brewing between 1:5 and 1:9 and then diluting to 1:11. I didn't expect to like this brewer that much, but wanted to give it a shot. Since getting it just after Christmas, I have been obsessed. It beats everything I've optimized for years from the switch and v60 on one end to the filtered french press and cold brew on the other. I pull out flavors with this thing that I just don't get any other way.

That said, I don't want to keep brewing in plastic (yes, even Tritan) with boiling water multiple times a day for years on end, so I'm looking to the Aeropress premium or the Weber BIRD as alternatives for soup shots. I know the BIRD probably seems like an odd choice for comparison here, but their site has a recipe for it that seems plausible enough, and maybe the vacuum created is a similar pressure differential across the coffee bed to the Oxo's \~1 bar.",2,1768754684.0,OXORapidBrewer,3,1.0,False

There are plenty of other groups dedicated to different niches, but generally they take place in South Philly or downtown. As a Northeast Philly resident, I wanted to dedicate this group a bit to the area itself. So, events will generally take place up in the northeast, because we also have many great coffee and bubble tea shops, and you know we has plenty of great food up here. 

The areas of interest and target audience would be around **Mayfair, Rhawnhurst, Upper Pennypack Lexington Park, the Roosevelt Mall, Bustleton Ave, Cottman, etc**. Anywhere within 20 minutes or so of the northeast is up for grabs as an event spot. We've got plenty of restaurants and even some Hot Pot we could check out.

I have some background in tech and job hunting, so I don't mind helping some of the younger folks get started. I'm an OG at heart though so there's not a hard age range in mind for people to join the group. 

  
I want to see what this group can turn into, because I haven't seen anything for the Northeast region. We'll keep the meetups a mix of fun and seriousness as we expand our networks and help each other move towards their goals. Even if your goal is just to hangout in the area, that's a great one to have!

**From the Producer:**

“Experience the familiar flavors of the award-winning Ritual Whiskey Alternative. Notes of vanilla, oak, stone fruit and caramel, finishing with a pleasant heat. Make Old Fashioneds, Whiskey Sours, Manhattans and other classic whiskey cocktails – without the alcohol. Simply replace traditional whiskey with Ritual Whiskey Alternative 1:1 to make any cocktail non-alcoholic.”

**Ingredients:**

Fitlered Water, Cane Sugar, Natural Flavors, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Caramel Color, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate.

Additionally, the bottle lists “American Oak, Madagascar Vanilla, Capsicum Fruit, Sugar Floss, Mesquite Smoke, Warm Caramel, Stone Fruit, Black Peppercorn, Prickly Ash, Toasted Spice”. These descriptors are just on the label, so I assume it’s tasting notes rather than actual ingredients. Capsicum Fruit and Prickly Ash, aka [Szechuan Peppercorn](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-szechuan-peppers-make-your-lips-go-numb-5668606/), makes me think they’re attempting to mimic ethanol burn (I’m making this assumption before tasting).

# TLDR

I'm giving this one a 5.45/10 average. I was genuinely impressed with this one, but that also could just be coming off the heels of Lyre's. It's got a solid ""burn"", not quite like ethanol but enough to be noticeable throughout. It generally performed well amongst the spread of cocktails, but the Old Fashioned felt way out of whack due to the higher base sweetness of the spirit. I was particularly pleased with the Highball, super smokey notes that seemed to come out of nowhere, and it didn't knock the carbonation out of the soda water.

**Neat - 5/10**

Appearance: 1/1 - A little cloudy, medium body, burnt orange in color, 

Nose: 1/3  - Potpourri aromatics, acidic twinge, caramel, no wood notes

Palate: 2/3 - Reminiscent of a ferment-y cider, high acid, good burn from prickly ash, a little bit of smoke character as it breathes for a a few minutes

Finish: 1/2  - Long, semi-sweet finish, lingering burn in the back of throat.

1qgdcc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qgdcc1/aitah_for_ruining_the_group_trip/,"AITAH for ""ruining the group trip""","Hi reddit, long time listener first time caller. This is a throw away and im on mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird. Apologies for a mammoth post, but i wanted to give as much context as I could.

This happened a few years ago, but to this day I have 0 clue what, if anything, I did wrong and need your help just to settle my mind.

A few years ago a few of my (now Ex) friends and I went on a trip to japan. Let's call them Monica, Rachel and Phoebe. We are all women and in our mid 20s at the time of the incident. These three girls already knew each other when I had joined their group about a year and a half prior, but I did already know phoebe from college as we were friendly in classes and she is how I met the other girls. It also feels relevant to mention that ive grown up just average middle class and public schools where as they have grown up very privileged and private schools. We would all hang out at least once a week for that year and a half, we could also just hang with one other person from the group and it would never feel weird or exclusionary at all. We were all really close, or so I thought.

Now back to the trip. Leading up to the trip everything was more or less normal, but I did start to notice a couple of things such as finding out one night they had all gotten together and written a list of where they want to go and see in japan. I didnt think too much about this at first because it was literally just on a sheet of paper and they told me about it and showed it to me excitedly. We had also all gotten together on another night to book accommodation, so I didnt think i had reason to think anything about it. One day about 3 weeks before the trip, the girl who I ended up having the most problems with, Rachel and I were at a Cafe and she told me how she was worried we didn't have an actual plan for the trip and didnt want to be wasting time once we got there, she asked if I could put something together and sent me the picture of the list of things/places they had all already written down. I said sure! I was on top of my college work, so I put together a mini google doc that we could all access and edit with all the information we could need on it. Accommodation adresses and phone numbers, flight numbers, the amount of days we were in each location and interesting things that are in that location and what's closest to each other so that we weren't always going back and forth. I posted the link in the group chat for everyone the next day. It is important for everyone reading this to know that this was not even a travel plan, it didnt have times or days apart from another column in the table when we moved accomodations. I had just moved everything from their piece of paper onto the google doc, mixed with other touristy things i thought everyone would enjoy, everything was accessible and editable by everyone. I also said when I posted the link to them that it is not a time table or even a plan, its just an easy reference point for if we ever needed any info while over there. 

Cut to the plane and the first day that we arrived in japan. On the plane there (a 12 hour flight), those 3 sat together and I was sat in another row as there were only 3 seats per aisle. When booking flights I tried to suggest going 2 by 2, but they said how we'd all just be sleeping on the plane anyway or just watching stuff, it wouldnt matter anyway. 

Yeah thinking back on it, I know how bad that sounds and I would personally never do that to someone I considered a friend, but I was just happy to be in a group of girls who I thought were cool. Ive never been in a close group of friends before, dont get me wrong, ive always had friends, but more of a one on one. I'm what could be described as the floater friend in groups, im friendly with everyone, I'll be invited on a night out or to someone's birthday get together, ill hang out with a couple people from the group or one on one and grab lunch, but ill also hear from them about how they and the rest of the group went to the movies or something that I was never invited to. I have a few close friends who now all know each other because ive known all of them for anywhere from 10 to 20 years, but we dont go out as a group, more just one on one, that kind of vibe. Tangent over, back to the story 

After arriving in japan and inevitability all getting lost in shinjuku station, we just had a relaxed day at our accommodation and having a lot at what was around us and our plan for the next day. The next day, we did some touristy things and while heading into a shopping mall we passed the giant Gundam and I excitedly tried to point it out to them but they all just seemed angry at me? I wasn't being loud or annoying, I was just happy to see it and thought it was cool, Monica grouched at me that we were going into the mall, and I replied saying how I knew that, but im allowed to be excited about something. I wasn't even slowing down or stopping anyone, but I just attributed it to jetlag and being hungry and brushed it off.

 It was after this these scenarios started happening more and more often.

I would say that I would want to go see or check something out, and they would say that they already have another plan, that they planned the night before, that they were doing and how if I dont want to miss it I need to come with them. I wouldnt argue, I'd just say that I didnt realise as no one had communicated that with me and ask if we could do one of my things on another day and they would just say that they'd see if we could fit it in and go to bed. One day, I went out by myself to do something that I wanted to do as no one wanted to join me and they had told me they had planned something that I wasn't interested in. It was days like this that I would come back and find out that together, they had all planned out the next few days etc. 

We all got in a small argument one night as I brought up how its not fair that they dont seem to like me going out by myself (telling me it wasn't safe, im a grown ass woman, speak and read some Japanese and also its literally tokyo) but they also dont want to listen to my suggestions of when we could do things, such as if they wanted to go to the Tokyo sky tree, we could also go to XYZ that day as theyre near by, instead of wasting an hour on the train going to the other side of Tokyo for something that we could do another day. They all begrudgingly apologised for me feeling left out, but not without Phoebe adding how I should ""try to include myself more"". I had been trying, id agree with them and everything, but everyone would always seem annoyed at me no matter what I did.

On one of the last days in Kyoto, we visited Nara Park, I had tried suggesting on previous days that we aim to go there on a day that we know will be nice weather, they had told me they dont care what my google doc plan said and that we'd do it on a day that suited everyone. This is where I started to see the root of the issue, I tried to explain how I wasn't following what I wrote on the google doc, there wasn't anything to follow, I just know that Nara would be a mostly outside day. No one would listen to me. Reader, we ended up in Nara surrounded by mud while freezing in kimono as it literally started snowing by 3pm. They more or less abandoned me in Nara, angry that they were cold and that I had suggested we at least do kimono on a different day as theyre not the warmest thing to wear, but they were dead set on doing kimono in Nara. While walking back to the train, I slipped and sprained my ankle, only Phoebe stopped for me as I literally fell to the ground, checking if I was okay, Monica and rachel rolled their eyes and huffed and continued walking, just annoyed at my existence. I had a conversation with Phoebe asking if I had done anything, please let me know so I can apologise and fix the problem. She told me she also didnt know why they were acting like that, she also hadn't heard anything, I think she was sincere.

I cornered rachel alone in the accomodation as she especially had been making very snippy comments to me just randomly throughout the last few days. I asked her if she had a problem with me. She said she didnt. I asked her to please tell me and communicate if she did because I cant apologise if I dont know ive done something. She told me nothing was wrong, that ive done and said nothing wrong. I knew something was up and had noticed her being increasingly manipulative so told her something along the lines of ""okay well, im sorry if there's anything ive said or done thats made you act this way around me, but seeing as you won't tell me what that is and refuse to talk to me, im going to go on with my holiday like everything is fine because youre telling me that everything is fine. It is not my responsibility to tiptoe around you when you won't tell me what ive done. Until you tell me you have a problem, its now on you"" 

This is where it REALLY started going south. She didnt like that.

 A couple days later, we were leaving our accommodation to go to Osaka. By this point my luggage was heavy and my ankle was in a brace and causing me a lot of pain, they helped each other bring their luggage down to the lobby, only Phoebe helped me at the end when she realised I was taking longer than everyone else. Originally, the plan was for us to find our way to the train and go to osaka that way, I asked if we could possibly share a taxi to osaka as sharing it by 4 it wouldnt be very expensive at all. Monica and Phoebe told me that theyre going to walk with their suitcases to the train station and were angry at me for making another suggestion. I told them fine, because of my ankle and the weight of my suitcase, ill just take a taxi or something, I'll figure it out because they seemed like they were in a rush. Phoebe asked me if I was sure I didnt want to take the train with them, I said yes, especially if the other girls were going to act like that, and how with my ankle I cant stand on it for that long while balancing a heavy suitcase. 

They all left and luckily it seemed that the hotel staff took pity on me because they were asking if I was okay and let me keep my suitcase in their back room while I had a bit more of a look around Kyoto and also went into a pharmacy and got some medicine for my ankle pain and helped me call a taxi.

I ended up taking a taxi to osaka by myself, it was expensive as it was just myself, and it blew my budget a bit, but I was just happy for rest for my ankle and that I wouldn't be wrestling with my suitcase on stairs. 

When I arrive at the accomodation in osaka, I asked if everyone wanted to grab something for dinner, they said no as they'd just eaten. Rachel, when I asked how the train trip was, very proudly announced how they actually decided a short walk away from the kyoto stay that it would be best for them to take a taxi, how it was really cheap because it was between the 3 of them, Monica chimed in on how much easier it was because of all of their combined suitcases. I just walked out to get something to eat from a street stall and cried. No one followed or asked how i was, i was completely alone. 

Throughout our stay in osaka, Monica and Rachel continued to make multiple snippy comments to me, one day while walking through a train station in osaka with Phoebe and Rachel, I told them it was the exit to our right as I had gone there literally the day before, rachel argued with me even though she had never been there, saying the maps said something different. We were half way out of the exit when this happened but Phoebe decided to follow rachel and so I followed and we ended up outside of the exit that was a much father walk and also right outside of the exit I had brought them to originally. This is where I started to snap, I said something sarcastic to the tune of ""oh wow would you look at that, the exit i suggested we go out of ten minutes ago"" rachel argued that it didnt matter as we ended up in the correct spot in the end in a very condescending tone and I just walked away from them and did my own thing that day. I would see on their instagrams that they were all posting pictures of themselves out at dinner or at events or touristy things when they had said they were going to do something else. 

It was at Fuji that I broke. We were in japan together for a month and that entire month just felt like psychological torture. Fuji was 3 weeks in and by all of the ignoring of me, weird little jabs and comments, some things that actually also felt nearly like jealousy? Everyone was showing what they had bought one day and both Monica and Rachel got angry as Phoebe and I excitedly showed the clothes that we had gotten. We are both quite short and petite, where as Monica and rachel are much taller and more muscular. Phoebe and I were just happy that we actually have clothing that properly fit us for a change without altering. We noticed the change in vibes and very quickly stopped showing our clothes, but the other two were already angry that we had more clothes that fit us than them. These two could literally be models, both bleach blonde and blue eyes, but they couldnt be happy that Phoebe and I found clothes easiest for a change. 

Rachel was also getting progressively more condescending at this point as she would start these weird competitions with me of who knew more japanese??? I had been speaking it for the last two years where as she did it all through highschool when that option wasn't available to me, but also like I dont care??? 

I could NOT stop crying the first day we were in fuji as I accidentally walked in on Rachel complaining about how I rude I am to her and how im always trying to undermine her? They saw me and immediately stopped talking and trying to comfort Rachel and Monica rushed say something about how I misheard. I didnt, I was standing there listening to them for about 30 seconds before they noticed me. It was a nice day in fuji and I had tried suggesting that we should go to the fuji look out while its a nice day instead of the caves as we could see them the next day and how we weren't guaranteed to see fuji the next day. This is what supposedly caused Rachel being so upset by me, saying how I couldnt get over my stupid google doc (that she asked me to make), I wasn't even talking about the google doc? It was a nice day and we were only going to be in fuji for 2 nights? Both Monica and rachel were permanently cold with me from this moment on. They refused to go to the fuji lookout, saying they wanted to do the caves and that since Monica was driving as we rented a car just for fuji, thats what we were doing. I kept breaking down in tears throughout looking at the caves, my anxiety was fully consuming me and I was just so depressed and not knowing what I had done wrong. It was like I wasn't even there, they just fully ignored me. I would try to have fun, to brighten myself up, and then Rachel or Monica would roll their eyes at me getting a stamp or huff at me and I would quietly start crying again. they knew, they just didnt care. 

They were also super angry the next day when it so happened to be raining and guess what... no fuji view. It literally was perfect the day before, but no one listen. I was so frustrated at that point that when one of them complained at a viewing point, I said as much.  

When we got back to the accomodation, after a break of NOT seeing Mt fuji, Phoebe suggested we all go in the Onsen at the hotel. I wasn't sure at first because Monica and Rachel would be there, she assured me they'd be fine. The onsen itself seemed fine, but when we were getting out they told me to go wash up first and that Rachel would bring the towels. I dont know why I trusted her. She brought everyone's towel except mine, forcing me with just a hand towel to go back through the onsen after washing up. Once we got back to the hotel room, she said it was an honest mistake, I was overreacting, all with a smile on her face.

 I left and sat in the parking lot in the car in the cold just crying for about an hour before coming back into the hotel room, Monica told me how I was ruining the trip she planned and look how upset I had made rachel by not accepting her apology. I broke, I scream cried at them for treating me like they had, how they had been glaslighting and ignoring me this entire trip. I feel sorry for other hotel guests because they definitely heard me, but I was damn near s\_\*\_idal at this point. Rachel had been able to turn it all around on me and to this day I dont know what I did. 

I left the trip early home. In the groupchat i had posted no less than 2000 photos of them all and i was maybe in a total of 6 of theirs. I still wish I hadn't sent them the photos. im a photographer by trade, theyre good photos and have since seen Rachel ironically using one of my photos, in my borrowed beanie, as her profile photo. 

There were many other things that happened during this trip, such as asking me to join them when I was on the other side of Tokyo, them begging me and me telling them it would take me an hour, them saying that its okay and then once I arrived, they all suddenly decided that they were all tired and went back to the accomodation, another hour away. I obviously didnt join them as I had just been travelling for an hour. Rachel saying how, when I was asked out on a date by korean guy at a club and the next day just for fun had lunch with him as he had lived in tokyo for a while and wanted to show me around (not that it would matter but i didnt spend the night with him, I just went out to lunch with him the next day), I showed everyone the pics of us from our lunch and Rachel chimed in saying that he also hit on her at the club but she wasn't as easy as me?? I didnt see her with him at all so im pretty sure she was just trying to make me insecure? 

Once everyone was back in our home country I messaged them asking what I could have possibly done or said, ill apologise, im sorry what did I do? Monica never responded to me again, Rachel wrote me a long text explaining how if I dont know what I did, she cant help me and that its all my own doing and I caught up with phoebe on a coffee day and she told me she has no idea, but I also ended up cutting her off as she didnt help me at all while on the trip or stand up for me and couldnt help but feel like she was just taking whatever information back to the other girls. They've all been blocked for the year and a half. 

Reddit I am so sorry this is so long but please, it is two years later and this still plagues my mind, what did I do? Did I do anything? Did they just not want me on the trip??? My actual friends who ive had for multiple years now say they were just mean girls and wanted cheaper accomodation by having another person but didnt actually want me on the trip which is what I think is the case but I truly have no idea. We were so close for about a year and a half before all of this started happening from day one of the trip. Did I miss something? What did I do?

So I stumbled into this super small, slightly scruffy little place called Leeratelier “Ik leer het ook nooit” and honestly… it’s kind of perfect in the most unprofessional way possible. No slick website. No shiny branding. No “book now!” buttons. Just a couple of handwritten notes pinned up in random places like supermarkets and community boards, the way things used to work before everyone turned into a marketing robot.

It’s basically a low-key leather workshop for people who don’t have a huge budget, don’t have fancy tools, and don’t want to sit in a classroom pretending they’re “creative” while someone hands them a worksheet and calls it personal growth. Here you just… make something. With your hands. And somehow your head shuts up for a minute.

The vibe is simple: you show up, you drink some coffee, you mess around with leather, you cut stuff wrong, you laugh, you fix it, and at the end you go home with something you actually made yourself. Not perfect. Not Pinterest-ready. But real. Like a keychain, a strap, a little tag, a belt loop thing, whatever fits in the time and whatever you can handle without losing your mind.

And the name makes sense too. “Ik leer het ook nooit” is basically the official slogan of every adult who has ever tried to learn anything new and got humbled immediately. It’s honest. It’s dumb. It’s relatable. It doesn’t act like you’re joining some elite craft society. It’s more like: “yeah you’ll probably mess it up a bit, welcome to the club.”

What I liked most is how low-pressure it is. Nobody cares if you’re “good” at it. Nobody’s judging. Nobody’s filming reels. It’s not one of those hobby places where everything is pastel and inspirational quotes are on the wall. It’s more like: old-school working with your hands, and if you accidentally have a deep thought while cutting leather, that’s your problem.

Also, the materials aren’t expensive boutique stuff. It’s the kind of workshop where you hear sentences like:

“Yeah we picked up some leftovers from somewhere.”

“This piece is weird but it works.”

“Don’t worry, just punch another hole and pretend you meant it.”

And weirdly… that’s exactly why it works. Because people who don’t have a lot of money usually don’t need fancy. They need something accessible. Something that doesn’t make them feel stupid. Something where you can just show up and do a thing without having to perform a personality.

It’s the type of place where you might meet someone like a 52-year-old guy who says he’s “not creative at all” and then suddenly he’s fully focused for an hour making a clean little leather key fob like he’s been doing it for 20 years. Or someone who came “just to try” and ends up leaving calmer than when they walked in, because their brain finally had something normal to do.

No drama, no hype. Just leather, hands, mistakes, and a tiny win at the end.

If you’re in the Veluwe and you see a dumb little handwritten note somewhere that says something like “leerworkshop” and it looks slightly suspicious… it might actually be this. And it might be exactly what you didn’t know you needed.

Not life-changing. Not magical. Just a small, practical afternoon where you make something real and your phone stays in your pocket for once.

* Growing up I was always well versed in pop culture: movies, tv shows, books, YouTube, fanfiction. From every media I consumed I was told a girl has a crush on a boy and they fall in love, get married, etc. and that sounded great because it’s all I knew.
* I never understood the difference between love and being in love, like didn’t that mean the same thing? 
* I went to all girls schools throughout my education so it never bothered me that I didn’t have a real crush. If someone asked “oh who’s your celebrity crush” I’d do what I thought was normal, pick the celebrity that was most aesthetically pleasing and closest to my age and go “definitely him, he’s so cute!”
* When I was 12 I had a poster of a teen boy band that I won from a contest. I remember my friend saying we should kiss it! I felt silly but I did and we laughed. 
* I never understood that big deal with being LGBT+, like guy or girl what does it matter? People should be allowed to date and fall in love with anyone they want.
* I’ve always been grossed out by s\*x scenes in movies, books, no matter if they were PG13 or rated R. I was just assumed when I’m older it won’t be as weird, because adults love this stuff right? Ehhh no, I’m almost mid twenties and still don’t get it. 
* I’m the age now when ALL my friends are getting married or REALLY want to get married and I don’t? Like the idea that I could find someone and feel that “true love” that everyone talks about sounds amazing. But I could never picture it my head. 

Over the past year I’ve been thinking that maybe I could be Ace and possibly also aromantic. I love Love, but for other people. I I still can’t imagine it for myself, though the idea sounds nice. I’ve never been kissed, never had a boyfriend (or girlfriend). 

* I finally gave into the idea of letting friends and family set me up with guys. They all want me to date like it’s the most exciting thing. But I’ve done a few virtual speed dating events, and while some of the guys seemed nice, it didn’t seem any different to just meeting new friends in college. 
* Most recently I agreed to go on my first ever date with this guy. We texted a little and seemed to have things in common. But when we met for coffee, alarm bells were ringing in my head like “I am not attracted to you”. Afterwards I was too nice to say no to a second date and we met again. And even more so I was NOT attracted to him at all. It made me a little uncomfortable thinking about it. 
* that night I came home watched JaidenAnimations video and it hit a bit too hard. I could relate to almost everything she said. 

I guess now I’m even more confused. Am I bi? if I try thinking about kissing a guy or a girl I really don’t feel any different. Have I just not met the right person yet? Should I keep trying? ",5,1768754153.0,asexuality,3,1.0,False

Too many for this wind, I think, reaching for my coffee. 

Through the stern windows, I see puffs of smoke from her bow chasers. One ball falls short, a plume of white water near our stern, the other skips and crashes through the windows. 

I feel the heat as it passes a hair’s-breadth from my hand, taking the coffee cup with it. 

“Miss Fielding!” I said in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel. 

“Sir?” My steward’s concerned face at the door. Her eyes fall to shattered dishes, tablecloth askew, then back to me with something like accusation. 

“Another cup please, thank you ma’am,” I say, surprised at the meekness in my tone. 

She salutes sullenly and disappears. 

In the Navy we’d have keelhauled her, I reflect. 

But a smuggling ship is a private venture, crewed by volunteers. My authority stems  from the fact that none of these other sods can lead our ship through a squall on a lee shore, navigate the Sicilian channels, or gauge the precise moment a French 3-decker’s topmast will crack. 

Which should be right about…now. 

The sailors on deck give a wild cheer as it topples, hanging off French ship’s side in a hopeless confusion of blocks, ropes and sailcloth. 

“Too much sail,” I say when Miss Fielding returns with the coffee. She shrugs. 

The coffee is hot and strong. I take several triumphant gulps before heading out on deck. 

Mr. Blythe turns from the taffrail and approaches. He’s a thin, pale, odd-looking fellow we picked up in Port Mahon; said he needed quiet passage, no papers. With his black coat and iced-over eyes he may as well have “Assassin” tattooed on his forehead. 

I focus my telescope on a passing shearwater, hoping my concentration will put him off. 

“More trouble, Captain?” 

“Almost certainly. In fact, I’d better have a look from the masthead.”

I spring for the rigging and climb on muscle-memory alone, the deck shrinking away beneath my feet. 

No sooner had I reached the startled lookout then there came cries from below: 

“What’s that lubber doing?” 

“Damn fool. He’ll break his neck!” 

Peering over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled in the rigging. He’s followed me up, the pragmatical bastard! 

Halfway he slips, falling backward with his feet caught in the shrouds, his body swinging with the role of the ship and a look of pure horror on his face. 

Miss Dangerfield was at that moment climbing the opposite rigging with the kettle’s leather strap in her teeth. She hangs it on a ratline, leaps for the backstay and swings across to Mr. Blythe, setting him upright. 

“Not like that,” she says, moving his hands from the horizontal ropes to the vertical. “Hold these here. Like so.” 

Five minutes later, we pull Mr. Blythe up onto our platform. He at once wraps both arms and legs around the mast, eyes closed and looking quite ridiculous. 

“Come sir, open your eyes!” I say. “You’ll not miss the view? It’s quite spectacular.” 

Reluctantly, Mr Blythe opens one eye, then the other. His face changes from fear to astonishment, then wonder at the infinite blue rolling away on all sides. 

“I’m amazed!” He says, relinquishing his hold. A smile breaks out across his reptilian face. “Amazed!” 

“Take my telescope,” I say, unsure why I no longer find him off-putting. “There, to starboard…no sir, starboard…there you are, sir…you can make out the western tip of Formentera.” 

“Incredible,” he says, sweeping the glass back and forth.

The kettle makes it’s way up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love. 

Suddenly Blythe freezes, the telescope pointing south. “And what are those sleek, shiny vessels coming around the cliffs there? Are they racing?” 

It’s as I feared. We’d outrun a French 3-decker, but these harbor police with their American-built flyers are the fastest sailors afloat. 

“Baltimore clippers,” I say, tossing my cigar over the side. “Revenue cutters.” 

Back in my cabin I make bundle of our ship’s log, bills of laden, port authorizations, and a four-pound cannonball, then toss it through the shattered stern ports. 

Miss Fielding appears with my best coat and number one hat, which I don sideways like an old-fashioned commodore. Buckling my sword, I take a new packet of false papers under my arm and stride out. 

The cutters are much closer now. 

“Inspection!” Hails a voice from the nearest, and my heart drops. Lieutenant Turnbull. “Spill your wind and lie-to under my leeward rail. Under…my…leeward…rail!” 

“Fuck their leeward rail,” says Miss Fielding.

The cutters hook on, and Turnbull scampers up the ladder, followed by a score of men with muskets. 

“I’m looking for your passenger,” he says. 

“Passenger?” I look up and down the deck, quizzical as a cat. 

“Come, Captain, that will not do. You know the fellow I’m speaking of: black coat, ill-looking. Spanish passport.” 

“Oh, him, yes. We dropped him off in Gibraltar. Between you and me, sir,” lowering my voice, “he had something of the air of a criminal.” 

“Indeed?” The lieutenant brought his face closer. “Are you aware sir, that this fellow you’re protecting is a hunter for inquisition?” 

I knew it, an assassin! The satisfaction brings a smile before I can stop myself. 

“Find it funny, do you?” Turnbull’s face changes color. “Eight pounds a head…thumscrews, the rack…Christ, sir, even you cannot say that don’t strike you as dirty.” 

Did he say eight pounds a head? I was crunching numbers before he finished speaking. 

“Suppose you find him…I imagine I’ll going along…that is to say, I’d be arrested, too?” 

“Summarily,” said Turnbull, “but only as a formality, were you to save us a long search. Three days in the brig at Minorca and you’re back at sea.” 

I point upward. “He’s at the masthead. Pray, let me run up and see him down, Lieutenant. He’s apt to fall otherwise.” ",1,1768753861.0,writers,1,1.0,False

I’ve been using their Pre for over 10 years now, and not only is the flavor horrible, they pulled out SO many of the good ingredients/supplements. 

I even messaged the company. I am desperately trying to find a replacement 😭😭

The first picture is the original formula and the second is the new.

1qgd07s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qgd07s,Osaka and Kyoto coffee,"Just a few places I could get to between appointments. 

OSAKA

Aoma - their style is quite austere. Only washed coffees and very delicate with very long ratios. I had a Geisha. It’s not my ‘cup of tea’ so to say. If my tastebuds squint really hard, I could probably speculate the tasting notes into fruition … imo under extracted. 

Glitch - It’s on the ground floor of an office building. More of a kiosk rather than a shop - like a Starbucks. Plenty of seating and not busy at 5pm. Service was very good - the barista took time to talk to me about grind size, structure etc. I enjoyed my cup. Glad the bank approved my loan to buy some beans. Tasting notes accurate although the space is double height and so the coffee cools down so fast it detracted from the experience. At least I checked it off my list. Would not repeat. 

Sot - only seating space for 2-3 inside and 4-5 outside. My cup was excellent. Struck up conversation with some other coffee nerds visiting from HK and we traded tastes in agreement enjoyed both — so much so we bought both beans tasted. Tasting notes accurate. Felt like I finally arrived. 

KYOTO

Weekenders - it was so busy when visited at around 11a that I didn’t bother to wait and instead walked to … 

Blend - this was the rec by the HK couple. Per name they specialize in blends - I think 3-4 were geisha + ? and maybe a total of 8-10 to choose from. Not busy at all which is a shame. The cup I had was crystal clear, balanced with just enough body to not feel thin. Tasting notes were spot on. The barista gave me a taste of a cold white coffee as well - delicious. Perfumed its flowers, delicate fruitiness and very elegant. I should have made a purchase and was planning on going back but time got away from me. Would repeat. Really well done. Bravo. 

I did manage to have a cup of the geisha on offer at Weekender the next day when there were less people (10+ waiting for coffee was less than day before). Aroma faint, taste and body were out of balance - muddy, thin, sour slightly astringent. I assume they’re that busy from open to close and maybe I caught pouring fatigue at 5p.  Checked off the list anyhow. 

I did have some random cups in both cities but nothing that seems remarks.

I've got a few decommissioned LGA 1151 desktops (Fujitsu D3402-A1 mobos) that I'm currently using as servers. These originally came with i5-6500s which are becoming a bit tight for my use case. On the other hand, 6th-7th gen i7s are still too expensive for what they offer.

I've found the Xeon equivalents of these i7s for barely 10-13€ each. However the catch is that Intel artificially blocked these Xeons from running on consumer boards (Intel being Intel).

Is anyone familiar with the process of unlocking Xeon support? I've seen people recommending CoffeeTime to ""lobotomize"" the ME (Management Engine), which apparently is the component preventing the Xeons from booting.
I have a CH341A hardware programmer and know how to use it, so the flashing itself isn't an issue.

Is it possible to inject Kaby Lake microcode to enable Xeon V6 support, and if so, is it worth it for the ~10% performance gain? The D3402-A1 does not officially support kaby lake stuff.",3,1768753677.0,hardwarehacking,0,1.0,False

Tomorrow I'm returning to America after a blazing quick 2.5 weeks. I had not been back to Hong Kong since 2018 despite it being my birthplace. Its clear that many things have changed in that time but I can confirm that its still as charming as I last recalled. 

I specifically wanted to post here because I extensively used posts from here as a resource for recommendations and general tips so I wanted to give something back.
As I was compiling a list of what I liked in this visit, that list grew far too large so I'll be keeping it concise to 10 of my favorite moments of the trip and 10 things I loved to eat. 

10 favorite moments
* Riding the star ferry at sunset while sipping on a VLT juice box
* Walked down the new Hong Kong Island walkway with my grandpa from Shau Kei Wan to Wan Chai
* Hanged out with some monkeys at Kam Shan Country Park

* Shared a table at Sheung Hei with a older guy who turned out to be a higher up at Maxim caterers and is writing a cook book
* Made the short hike up the ten thousand golden buddha monestary in Sha Tin
* Hiked Dragon's Back in Shek O

* Made some friends at Draftland in LKF and joined them clubbing at 33
* Having a reunion family dim sum with the entirety of my mom's side of the family

10 favorite bites

The limo’s air felt like a morgue. She was sweating anyway—Los Angeles in July lived under her skin no matter what the vents did. The car was supposed to be safe and glossy and perfect, but it smelled like polish and recycled breath and that sweet plastic tang fake leather never stopped giving off. The kind of smell that sat on the back of your tongue and refused to leave.



Everything rubbed her nerves raw. The dress gripped like armor. The straps cut into her shoulders until the skin lifted, angry and red. The seat clung to the backs of her thighs like tape, and when she shifted, it made that faint squeak that reminded her this was all a set built to look expensive.



And Megan, her assistant with the too-calm face, kept tapping her phone. Posting something again. The glow lit her cheekbones like she was being filmed from below.



Thinking about doing the smile-and-wave for cameras made Jessica furious. Stupid, animal furious. Her jaw stayed tight even when she told herself to loosen it. The bitter taste of the pill Megan had handed her still lingered an hour later. Chemical and wrong. It sat in her throat like a coin, but it was the only thing that kept her hands from shaking on camera.



The second the limo pulled up, the reporters swarmed like starving strays—snouts up, teeth out, fighting over whatever they could rip loose. Flashes. A wall of phones. All of it was just noise they called fame.



The dressing room felt like a warm hand on the back of the neck. Jessica loved the dressing room. Territory. Refuge. A door you can shut. A mirror that was hers until it lied.



Bliss lasted one second.



A tech kid in a crumpled shirt bolted in. Purple hair, a rose tattoo climbing his throat. He mumbled something Jessica didn’t catch and **shoved an earpiece into her ear like he was plugging in a lamp**. The cartilage flared with a needle-stab, sharp enough to make her eyes water.



“What the hell—” Jessica spun. He was gone.



Fifteen minutes. In fifteen minutes she had to be confidence in heels, success with teeth, under a hundred thousand hungry eyes. Something popped in her head like a sparkler. The earpiece crackled alive.



A voice, flat and clean, like a GPS rerouting you through a neighborhood you didn’t choose:





***Say: I am honored to be the new face of Veritas Health Systems***.



Jessica froze. Her head turned without her deciding to turn it. No one. She stepped out of the dressing room. Faces everywhere—stagehands, wardrobe, makeup—moving with that bored urgency.



The E News mic slid toward her mouth. It smelled like someone else’s lipstick and coffee breath. In her ear, the same calm voice, unfazed:





***Say: I am honored to be the new face of Veritas Health Systems***.



Her lips moved.





**“I am honored to be the new face of Veritas Health Systems”**.



Jessica had signed nothing with Veritas. Zero. It felt like someone had climbed inside and taken the controls, like her tongue was a lever they’d learned to pull.



The voice continued: ***Add: And it is a privilege to work with the team***.



Her mouth obeyed. Her body tried to seize up around it. Her right fingers fizzed, a numb patch blooming. Sweat ran down her spine with nowhere to go.



Jessica shot into the main hall. She wanted to leave the whole stupid theater, just walk out right now, but **the role had her by the throat**.



""Jessica Wells!"".



She stood. Automatic. Steps up the stairs. The trophy was heavier than she expected, solid and cold in her hands.



In the reflection of the gold, **her lips lagged her voice by a fraction**. Onstage it was her. In the metal it was a stranger that had borrowed her cheeks.



Click. That same clean voice slid into her head like a file into a drawer.





***Say: I am honored to be the new face of Veritas Health Systems***.



“I am honored to be—” She tried to stop. Her tongue didn’t listen. **“—the new face of Veritas Health Systems”**.



Cold shot up the base of her skull. Her jaw kept moving without permission.



She left the stage like falling. Jessica doubled over the toilet in the restroom and dry-heaved until bile burned her throat. On the tank sat a white card: **Veritas Health Systems**.



Flip side: Bravo. Wonderful speech. We are sincerely excited to work together.



Her phone lit up—a press release: **Veritas Health Systems announces partnership with Jessica Wells**.



The press release timestamp said it was published before she’d spoken.



The script was already written. She was just the mouth.",1,1768753348.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

For anyone new to IBD who may be scrolling the feed, or hasn't had a flare up in a while, here's a reminder of foods to avoid whilst in an IBD flare

* High-fibre foods - Fruits with skin on (peeled and ripe is normally fine), fibrous, sulphur-containing and raw vegetables like brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, nuts, seeds, and beans
* Dairy products - cow’s milk, cream, ice cream, cheeses, and yoghurt
* Added sugars and sugary foods - cookies, pastries, cakes, honey, maple syrup
* High-fat and fried foods - butter, burgers, fried chicken, chips/fries etc
* Spicy foods (seriously, don't even try it) - sriracha, chilli powder, hot peppers, hot sauce
* Caffeinated and Alcoholic drinks or foods containing alcohol
* Sugar-sweetened drinks - fizzy drinks/sodas, coffee/espresso drinks with sugar/syrup, juices
* Ultra-processed foods in general are best to avoid where possible.

Long lasting, transfer proof, low maintenance. Every brand seems to promise that you can eat, drink, and forget about touch ups entirely.

But reviews are all over the place. Some people say stains cling for hours, others say they disappear the second you have a meal, especially anything oily. I also keep seeing mentions of uneven fading or that weird inner lip ring after food.

I’m curious because I want something that won’t vanish after coffee or lunch, but I also don’t want dry, crusty lips by the end of the day. For those who actually use lip stains regularly, do they realistically last through eating and drinking, or is that mostly hype?
