I might be the asshole here, because I have a habit of being a bit bad with how I word things. I have a neurodivergence, so I’m not the best with tone. But I believe I was respectful in the way I presented my boundaries. I suppose that’s for you to decide though. 

Throwaway because my other account is used for commission work. 

So I’m relatively new to having agoraphobia. I’ve not been officially diagnosed by the doctor due to the crippling state of the UK healthcare system- especially for mental health- especially for men’s mental health. 

But it’s obvious I’ve got it. 

I haven’t left the house for longer than an hour since October 2024, and I haven’t left the house point blank since before Christmas. I can’t. I won’t. 

Now I’ve never had a good relationship with my parents, especially my step-mum. We’re talking about the woman who told me I was attention seeking when I told her “I’m su*cidal and need help”. 

But that was years ago, and although we’ve been low contact since I moved out, we’ve been on better terms. 

She knows I’m going through this, and in a moment of desperation, I asked her for help. I had no food in the home, and the only money I had was in cash- so I couldn’t order anything in. 

I simply asked if she could pick up like 4-5 things and I’d give her the cash at the door. Her business is around the corner from my home so it wouldn’t be out of her way. 

Originally she said yes, and we worked out a time and a date etc. but when it came to the morning of when she was supposed to come round, she asks me to come with her. “Can you come with me in the car? We can stop off at the coffee drive through and I’ll put £10 towards your shopping”. 

Wtf. 

I politely declined, thanked her for her offer, and explained what my boundaries were and why I had them. No biggie right? Wrong. 

This led to her telling me I was dramatic, giving me attitude, guilt tripping me because I’m not visiting my grandma (why by the way my step mum doesn’t even like), and so on so forth. 

I ended up telling her not to come round, and that I would sort it out myself. 

I don’t know what I did wrong? What did I say that was so offensive to her? Why is my mental health either not important, inconvenient or just simply offensive to her? 

Not to mention, she said “everyone’s been talking, everyone’s worried, everyone has their opinions. But no one will talk to you because this is how you act”. 

Explaining my boundaries? Politely declining? Offering to just sort out something else as not to be an inconvenience? How is that me acting out? 

I’m literally a nineteen year old mentally ill guy living with his fiancé with no financial support or mental health care. I’m not trying to excuse myself from responsibility, but I think I’m doing pretty damn well considering the circumstances.

1hy7qv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1hy7qv7/how_do_you_handle_customer_feedback_as_a_small/,How Do You Handle Customer Feedback as a Small Restaurant Owner?,"As someone who’s been working closely with small, family-owned restaurants and businesses in the food and drink industry, I’ve seen how challenging it can be to deal with customer feedback—especially online.

Platforms like Google and Yelp are great for visibility, but they don’t always make it easy for restaurants to tell their side of the story. A simple reply to a negative review often doesn’t feel like enough, and there’s no real way to show proof or context.

It’s frustrating to see hardworking restaurant owners spend time defending themselves instead of focusing on what they do best—serving great food and building connections with their communities. And sometimes, even as a customer, I’ve seen situations where restaurants tried to make things right but still ended up with a negative reputation because of misunderstandings or one-sided reviews.

This got me thinking: What if reviews could be more transparent and interactive? Imagine if restaurant owners had the opportunity to resolve issues directly with customers and show proof of their efforts right within the review conversation. Even other customers could join in, sharing their own experiences and engaging in meaningful discussions.

It would make reviews feel more like a social media post—open to interaction, feedback, and even support from loyal customers. Almost like a mix of Yelp and Reddit, where reviews aren’t just static but part of an ongoing conversation.

I’m curious to hear from this community:
	•	As a restaurant owner, how do you handle customer feedback—especially when it’s unfair or inaccurate?
	•	As a customer, how do you feel about the way restaurant reviews work on platforms like Google and Yelp? Do you think they tell the full story?

On a related note, I’ve been working on something like this already—a platform specifically designed for small restaurants, food trucks, coffee shops, and catering businesses. It’s still in the works, but the goal is to create a space where businesses and customers can connect in a transparent and meaningful way.

The idea isn’t to become just another reviews platform or compete with existing ones. Instead, it’s about building a community of like-minded people who love to support and uplift the hidden gems in our neighborhoods.

What’s unique is that as customers leave positive feedback (4 stars and above), our platform could encourage them to share their reviews on the restaurant’s other platforms, like Google, Yelp, or Facebook, to help increase their exposure. It’s all about amplifying the voices of both restaurants and customers to strengthen those connections.

I’d love to know if this is something you’d find helpful or if there’s something else you think could make the feedback process better. Let’s talk about it!",1,1736525069.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

1hy7q28,https://i.redd.it/d3xpo6tew6ce1.jpeg,“Mrs. Composer” - Excerpts from an interview from 2018 ,"*From Fakker! 8/2018*  
  
**IS IT VERY DIFFERENT FOR YOU TO PERFORM ON YOUR OWN?**  
  
Yes, and the best feeling is to hear the fans singing the lyrics that I wrote! That's really magical and emotional. It's a blessing! Plus, I'm working with my love. I'm really grateful for the music and at the same time I try to stay humble because there's always someone better and no one can learn everything about music. I think if it happened now that I couldn't compose or sing, whether classical or rock, I would become a pile of misery.  
  
**HOW DOES YOUR SONGWRITING USUALLY GO? DO YOU LOCK YOURSELF IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE AND NOT COME OUT UNTIL IT'S DONE, OR IS IT ALL MORE RELAXED?**  
  
What ever... Like right now, my husband was watching the World Cup, so I was sitting next to him with headphones on, going through the already composed demos. We were all in the same room together. Sometimes I'm in the mood to compose even though there are other people around me. But most of the time I tend to shut myself away because I can't work when Naomi is running around wanting to play. Especially when the deadline is slowly approaching, you need to immerse yourself in it.  
 I don't like to leave things to the last minute.   My family is incredibly supportive of that. Since Marcelo works with me, it's easy to schedule my day so that I have enough time to myself when I'm composing. I have to give credit to Naomi as well, she's very understanding. When we tell her that mommy needs to work, she has no problem with it. She always says, ""Okay, Mom, I'll do this and that and wait for you when you have time."" She's so cute. (melts)  
  
**NAOMI'S SIX YEARS OLD, IS SHE IN SCHOOL YET? I IMAGINE STARTING SCHOOL MUST MAKE THE WHOLE TOUR PRETTY COMPLICATED.**  
  
She just finished first grade and is about to start second grade. She's a very happy little monster who speaks with a perfect British accent. (Laughs)  
Naomi can speak English, Finnish and Spanish, it's incredible. She's also talented in drawing, for example. I think that comes from my father, because when it comes to drawing, I'm absolutely terrible and I can't help her at all. Before, Naomi used to come with us, so all three of us were together all the time.  
  
**DO YOU MISS BEING ON TOUR ALL BY YOURSELF NOW?**  
  
Yes, I miss them a lot. Naomi always cries when I leave, saying goodbye is really hard. But thanks to modern technology, we're in touch every day. Sometimes I'm even lucky enough to put her to bed remotely when she puts her iPhone next to her pillow.
 and I tell her bedtime stories. It's different than when we were all together, but at least it helps a little.  
  
**NAOMI'S ALREADY RECORDED A SONG WITH YOU. ARE YOU GIVING HER ANY PROFESSIONAL GUIDANCE WITH HER SINGING?**  
  
No! No! Not at all! She's too young for that. But she has a piano teacher because she wanted one. I certainly don't want to force her into anything. She had one piano performance recently, and she's really enjoying it. I'm glad she found a hobby like this. I leave the singing to her, too, and she sings around the house a lot. But I certainly don't dare to correct or direct her at this age, that would only do her harm. However, if she comes to me needing help with the piano, I'm happy to help her. I want her to enjoy her childhood. I didn't start school until I was seven years old, Naomi is six and she's already in first grade, and it's already going so fast.  
  
**DO YOU HAVE AN INSPIRATION THAT ALWAYS GETS YOU GOING?**  
  
I don't usually have inspiration directly, but when I do, I often listen to movie soundtracks or my favorite metal bands. Lately it's often progressive rock stuff, because I'm trying to be more progressive myself. I like the changing parts and the different musical twists. I like to watch Hans Zimmer in concert from the Czech Republic. But it's more just me and me and me.  
  
**QUESTION FOR THE END. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS A SURE RECIPE FOR OVERCOMING ""CREATIVE BLOCK""?**  
  
I go out and run. I just put on my tennis shoes and run or ride my bike. I definitely need to think about something else. I'm gonna have a couple of coffees and play sports. It's definitely not good to sit on that thing and worry about it, it doesn't get you anywhere. I'm sure it's great to watch a movie, go to the cinema... Just relax and don't think about the problem.

*Vilantia Prime, Chamber of the Great Council*

The chamber was in an uproar, a great deal of it centered around The Interview. The Throne and Throne-Heir were still pools in a storm, simply observing the latest as the Minister of Communication waved a tablet in the air.

""I agree that action should be taken, but I object strenuously to the shape of the action proposed. To wipe The Interview completely would be impossible. My secretaries have reviewed the most-searched phrases on the Grid since that time. The top five in order from low to high - 'Terran Foreign Legion', 'Sword of the Light Gods', 'Nameless Restoration', 'Does the *Twilight Rose* Captain have a secondwife', and 'What did the Terran mean when she said Wee Knee'. In addition to the questions regarding the Grid-searches, there have been petitions asking if he can be Restored immediately. The herd is loosed from the fence, Ministers. We may choose to pretend that the Nameless Captain has not brought great turmoil, but the turmoil will remain. I would recommend, Ministers, that we face and answer these questions.""

The War Minister shifted slightly. ""Answer as you will, but I will take care of the problem at the root. The problem is that Captain. He upsets the order. Flaunts himself and insults tradition at every turn. His supposed mercenary company seeks honor in their shame. And his Terran follower, no different. Daring to question why a Hurdop pirate ship should not be destroyed. Justice *must* be exacted upon them.""

There was a nod from the Minister of Trade. ""Indeed – if mercenaries are needed to escort our goods safely, then let it be Vilantian mercenaries who walk with the scent of honor following. Not these soft Terran merchants with guns.""

The Throne rapped for attention, stilling the conversation. ""The questions at hand will be answered by the Minister of Communication. The Nameless captain must pass his Trials with success before his name and fur are to be known again. The Throne has seen the Captain pass the Trial of the Water-Wise and the Trial of the Wood-Wise. Encourage those who would witness his deeds communicate them to the Ministry of Communication for review and completion of the subsequent Trials. I would caution the Minister of War against action that would lead to angering the Terrans. Their aid in this time is great, and recall that they were able to bring the Collective's race of bred warriors to the bargaining table for peace.""

The War Minister exhaled once as if to disagree, before nodding. ""I will ensure that we do not give the Terrans a reason to withdraw themselves.""

The Minister of Culture took a breath before adding her voice. ""My Throne, all of this overlooks a greater threat. This...these new things, ideas. A Nameless being seen, interviewing with our finest newscasters. Such words, saying that Vilantia and Hurdop are of the same litter - blasphemy on the face of it, if not outright treason. Terrans bringing their ideals, and Hurdop pretending to peace. The foundations of Vilantia are under assault – and such is not a simple thing to repair.""

""Minister Aa'benie, for thirty-three generations one of the foundations of Vilantian culture has been war with the Hurdop, and a second foundation has been preparing for war with the Hurdop. Indulge the Throne and consider suitable replacement foundations for our culture, please.""

The Minister lifted her nose. ""As the Throne wills it.""

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk groaned softly as he ate dinner with his bridge staff. And everyone had something to say.

""Cap, I had to set a filter up and have Rosie auto-reply – we have a folder for marriage requests, which is currently up to three thousand, another folder for job applications which is up to seven thousand."" Reilly was unhappy as she slogged through her macaroni and cheese with what she called ""hot dogs"" on top.

Rosie added to the conversation helpfully. ""There is a third folder now for those who are combining job application and marriage proposal. Seven hundred at last count.""

Hoban blinked as he listened to this. ""Cap...I got questions here.""

""No you may not do a burnout while exiting our parking orbit.""

""Disheartening, but not one of the questions. So like, are you some kind of handsome as Vilantians go? And Hurdop too, I guess. Seriously, this is like weird.""

Gryzzk paused. ""I...I honestly don't know. Grezzk finds me pleasing, but we were judged compatible by our Lords. This is chaos, even for me. Normally the population self-corrects in one direction or another with no laws being passed. The most recent war has been a greater detriment than I would have thought possible.""

""Weiiird. Okay so second question - the whole marriage thing, would the whole crew count as eligible for this? Like, even the Hurdop and the Terrans? I mean don't get me wrong, y'all are cute and everything but I ain't planning on signing up to have and to hold while I'm sucking up an extra half a G and I'm pretty sure most of the Terrans'd say the same. Okay maybe Gregg-Adams, but he's a little out there to begin with."" Hoban was eating some sort of noodles with a pair of sticks.

""I believe the law is only meant to apply to Vilantian citizens. The Hurdop would be compatible physically, but not socially. The same social issue applies to the crew, as they are all prisoners serving a punishment.""

""So that's gonna change next month.""

""I cannot speak to the mind of the council."" Gryzzk shrugged. Despite the awkward questions, it was pleasant to have something casual to discuss. ""So who's planning what for shore leave?""

Reilly chirped up immediately ""Bar crawl.""

Edwards was second. ""Making sure Reilly doesn't get arrested.""

O'Brien smirked. ""Find some food. And then hit the bar. Cap owes me two drinks.""

Hoban shrugged. ""Figured just walk around and smell something that ain't ship air.""

Rosie smiled softly. ""Chief Tucker thinks he can install the scent emitter on my disc tomorrow."" She brightened. ""It'll be our second date.""

Reilly quirked. ""Does *he* know that?""

Rosie paused. ""Oh. He hasn't said anything about it. I think he knows, what if he doesn't how do I tell him?"" Her expression went to mild panic.

Reilly leaned back. ""Oh...girl. You are gonna have to work on your communication skills. Just...ask him. I mean you're spending time together, eating, talking, all that right? Just ask him and see what he says.""

Rosie seemed to take a breath and consider. ""I will.""

Reilly smirked. ""Anyway, what's Vilantia's Most Eligible Husband going to do?""

Gryzzk fur quivered at his cheeks, his eyes moving around. ""I was going to take Nhoot to a park.""

There was a collective 'awww' from the table.

""Take pictures. Lots of pictures.""

""I will. But first, rest. That goes for everybody."" Gryzzk slid out from the booth and studied the Trade Collective paperwork before going to bed with far too many thoughts keeping him awake for too long before the room finally darkened.

The morning came all too quickly, and messages were still pouring in as Gryzzk showered and decided against breakfast. His stomach was too knotted up with the thoughts of the meeting to be able to handle anything more than toast and tea, and he didn't need to go to the mess hall for that. After considering, he put on his dress uniform and began the process of waiting and scrolling on his tablet as the reports came in from those returning from shore leave. Citations for public drunkenness, fighting, and indecent exposure from the constabulary appeared to be the general theme of the day. Finally he heard Reilly over the comm.

""Cap, Trade Cooperative shuttle requesting permission to dock.""

Gryzzk stood, tugging his uniform down at the waist to fit snugly over his shoulders. ""Direct them to the forward dock. They'll have enough problems walking."" He tapped his tablet. ""First Sergeant O'Brien to the forward docking bay."" He then made his way from the bridge, Rosie following silently.

It was amusing in some ways watching O'Brien in her dress uniform – firstly because he hadn't even needed to tell her to dress up, and secondly because there was something about it that made her look like a well-wrapped bomb.

The docking hatch was secured and rolled aside, revealing Undersecretary Ah'nuriel flanked by a pair of aides, all dressed in the robes of the Trade Ministry. The Undersecretary's scent was not masked, revealing a great mixture of emotions – the ones that stood out most were fear and desperation. There was no such scent from the aides as they carried themselves with confidence and surety. There was a slight surprise as they saw that they were being received formally.

There was a look upward from the undersecretary, far more than decorum required. ""Permission to come aboard.""

Gryzzk nodded. ""Welcome aboard, but be careful. Ship gravity in common areas is lighter than Vilantia, but not significantly more so. Please, follow me to our conference room.""

As he led them to the conference room slowly, there were a few stares from passing crew as they prepared for their shore leave or returned with lighter pockets and bandaged hands. The other strangeness was when they entered the bridge proper. Reilly was exiting the conference room and announced his presence on the bridge. The three on station promptly stood straight and rigid.

Gryzzk smiled inwardly at the slight display of deference to his authority. ""As you were. We will be in conference, please communicate any emergencies through the XO.""

As they went in, they found several warm mugs of tea and another mug filled with coffee. O'Brien sat herself behind the coffee mug while Gryzzk's spot was decorated with a large ceramic mug that had the Legion coat of arms on one side and the other side read ""Best Kaptin Evar"" in what appeared to be a child's crayon. Gryzzk sighed and mentally promised to fine whoever had misspelled Captain.

The undersecretary and her aides settled into their respective seats, each eyeing a mug suspiciously.

Gryzzk filled the silence with explanation. ""It's a Terran drink. Tea. It's relaxing."" He paused for a moment. ""We have received all of your messages. Which would you care to discuss first?""

The undersecretary was visibly relieved. ""The one we have not spoken of. The Genetic Legacy Preservation act. We - the Vilantian-Hurdop Trade Cooperative, we require your assistance in."" She paused as if gathering her courage. ""Many of us came to the cooperative after the previous Trade Minister resigned, hoping to help carry on his hopes for peaceful trade with the encouragement of the Throne-Heir. But with this, this Legacy Preservation Act. We were promised exemption, because of our families. Many of us lost our closest during the war, and the mourning still lingers. They promised us the opportunity to find our own second-spouses as the Clan Way permits for the lowers. We had hoped to find spouses within the allotted time of our own accord. But the Ministry increased our workload and prevented us from a proper interview. Many of us are to be married to spouses still within the Ministry within the next week or two weeks at the most. We would be married to those already wed and then expected to devote ourselves to bearing or siring children. There were no formal...meetings, anything. Just a print of their name and face."" Her aides did not speak but their body language and scent conveyed more than enough as the Undersecretary spoke. ""We would then be replaced by people more in line with Minister Aa'porti's vision for the Cooperative. Less cooperative and more teeth-to-neck.""

Gryzzk sipped at his tea. ""The Third Fleet receiving the bulk of the contracted work?""

A nod. ""Indeed. Minister Aa'porti has formed a coalition of sorts with the Ministers of War and Culture. They do not see the positives of peaceful coexistence, seeing it as akin to defeat.""

""And to prevent this you would...""

""Have those who are facing marriage – marry your crew."" Gryzzk set his cup down, waiting for what was to come.

O'Brien choked on her half-swallowed coffee. ""You're takin' the piss.""

The Vilantians, Gryzzk included, looked at her oddly. ""First Sergeant, that ah...did not translate properly.""

O'Brien waved her hands. ""Having a giggle. Joking. This is some mad prank that I don't get because I'm Terran."" She glanced at Rosie. ""You're recording this to make me look silly, yeah?""

Rosie shook her head. ""Based on my observations, they are serious. Frightened, but serious.""

Gryzzk held up a hand for silence. ""First Sergeant, arranged marriages are the norm for the first marriage, and less common but still approved with subsequent marriages. It could be argued that I am the Lord of the crew. I dislike the circumstances of the Undersecretary's proposal, but...there is generally benefit to both sides in these extreme situations. I should very much like to know how many are involved and what benefit we would receive.""

""We would look most favorably upon any contracts that you bid upon as a company. For the individuals, they would receive an eased path of their own upon their contract ending. As for the numbers, a third of the Cooperative – twenty-four total; eight men, sixteen women.""

Gryzzk paused for a moment longer. ""Our crew complement is sufficient for such a thing. There is an additional item to note, Undersecretary. Half of my crew is native to Hurdop, and I would have them eligible as well. I presume you are acting in stead of the Lord Secretary?""

There was a look of shock for a moment before the Undersecretary nodded. ""That. That would be in line with the Throne and former Trade Minister. And ah...yes. I am. The Lord Secretary is favored by the Minister Aa'Porti.""

""Very well. Have your shuttle bring the Cooperative up. During that time, should we proceed with the other item on the agenda?""

""They are all on the shuttle, all twenty-one remaining. The Trade Cooperative has agreed to your stipulations, but questions the necessity.""

""It is a Terran cultural concept that I seek to emulate. The stipulations are there to craft a partnership of equals. We have skills, talents that are useful. We sell those, and the buyer in doing so recognizes the time and effort put in to assemble the necessary items the buyer does not have.""

""The Minister of Culture would be displeased by your words.""

""I do not doubt it. But if the Minister has aligned herself as you say, I fear for our culture. Let us save what is right, and correct what is not."" Gryzzk turned to Rosie. ""XO, has everyone returned from shore leave?""

Rosie nodded. ""They have, my Lord Captain.""

Gryzzk shook his head at the insanity of it all. A Nameless, acting as a Lord to determine by scent and instinct who would be properly bound for life. And this all suggested by a government official in all but name. He tapped his tablet for the all hands channel.

""Attention, crew of the *Twilight Rose*. This is Captain Gryzzk. We have an unusual situation at our nose. You are aware that Vilantia is undergoing a crisis with respect to population, and the Genetic Legacy Preservation Act is the latest attempt to correct this. We have twenty-four Vilantians who seek partners. They have been assigned partners that they have not met and do not know. It is my wish to prevent this by giving them a traditional opportunity. If it helps, know that this is how Grezzk and I were chosen to wed. All those who would wish to volunteer themselves, please stand in front of your quarters in ten minutes. I stress that this is only for those who wish to have the possibility of a spouse. That is all.""

O'Brien was staring at Gryzzk slack-jawed. When she finally spoke, her accent was thick. ""You cannae be serious, Cap'n.""

""First Sergeant, I am quite serious. You heard them. They're going to be married without so much a scent of their partner. We still have a day of shore leave. If the Undersecretary and I choose well, that is all the time needed. If we choose poorly, the couples have at least a partnership and the Vilantians can choose a spouse of their own at their leisure.""

She shook her head, grumbling under her breath as she followed. ""Not enough to just send 'em down to Planet Hookup, gotta bring Planet Hookup up here too...stupid noble mad bastard...gonna rename this boat to the SS *Meaningful Overnight Relationship*...""

Gryzzk left the bridge to find the entire complement outside their quarters – Terrans included, who were seemed to be there to find out what the heck was going on. It was formal and not at the same time. Gryzzk and Ah'nuriel both sniffed each of the prospective candidates and then went down the assembled line, both sniffing and gesturing.

There were several candidates passed over before Gryzzk took in a scent and something in him paused - it brought a flood of memories - walking among roses, learning about Grezzk and what she was like, feeling a space in his soul fill without knowing it had been empty. He looked to Ah'nuriel and they both nodded, going back to the smaller group and selecting one to silently bring them together. Now Gryzzk realized why arranging a marriage was frowned upon until one was married - the scents of marriage and compatibility were too uncertain until one had gone through it. Part of him wondered how Lord A'kifab was managing his new bride.

Still, the process was almost industrial to the Terrans – there was a great deal of confusion, particularly after the first few couples proceeded to curl into each other for a long moment before going into the ship quarters to converse. Or not converse, which was not something Gryzzk wanted to think too deeply on. He liked to think his crew was properly respectful of the eldest traditions and that there would be some time given to learning each others' names before nature took hold. But he had his own duty to focus on – and through it all he was serious and thoughtful, but in time they had twenty-four couples, matched and thankful. And several of the Vilantians matched with Hurdop.

Ah'nuriel swallowed, leaning into her new betrothed – Pafreet. ""I will ensure the paperwork is filed with the Ministry of Culture after your ship departs."" She paused. ""I...I have a sister. I think she would like to meet you.""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""With all my heart Ah'nuriel, no. I know that times are harsh and some propriety needs to be overlooked - but I cannot do such a thing without my wife at my side in agreeance. Taking a secondwife with no Name to give her would shame all of us.""

Ah'nuriel lifted her head slightly. ""Of course. Forgive me for my rudeness at our meeting. I...you are deserving of a Name, Captain."" She paused. ""For the paperwork, what clan do they belong to?""

""I would have to check to confirm. Ask them...later.""

""I will.""

""Then please, enjoy your time with Pafreet. I will be planetside if needed."" Gryzzk gave both of them a smile before tapping his comm. ""This is the captain again. Shore leave will commence for the remaining half of the crew after briefing from First Sergeant O'Brien.""

He headed toward the bridge again, with the bridge crew trailing behind.

Reilly was softly chuckling to herself. ""I have never seen anyone speedrun a dating sim like that. Damn.""

Edwards nodded. ""Yeah and they're all fading to credits.""

O'Brien was fairly direct. ""How in the Special Hell do you *know* they'll work? Or stay together?""

Gryzzk spread his hands slightly. ""I can't know the future. But their scents were compatible, and you saw the Undersecretary concur. It is the least objectionable option.""

Hoban followed up. ""So...they're getting married because they smelled good together?""

Gryzzk took a small breath. ""Yes. That's...that's how it works. That's how it's always worked. How do *you* figure it out?""

Each answered in their own way. ""Dating app."" ""Lots of hanging out."" ""Shared interests."" ""Knock back tequila shooters until they're hot.""

Gryzzk rubbed at the bridge of his nose. ""We may need to discuss this further in R-Space. Dismissed for shore leave. Shuttles are leaving soon."" He went to change his own clothes to be less conspicuous. He had a feeling that he might be recognized once he left the spaceport.",2,1736524909.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Struggles: Having to go to the bathroom really bad during the 2nd section of the exam
Finished: With 50 minutes left - took my sweet time on the last section of the exam (after sweeping thru the first 2 sections) 

Takeaways:
! The test was much easier than study hall 
! Only 6 drag and drop and a couple of visualization questions 
! You will get a few questions that you can answer in <10 seconds 
! 1-2 questions that made zero sense but I didn't revisit any of my answers 

Study approach:
! UDEMY course from Umer Waqar (Mid November)
! YouTube - AR Ultra 200 / D&D, DM - Agile and D&D 
! Study Hall - all the mini exams and 2 full exams
! AR PMP exam simulator 
! 3rdRock notes (easy read) 
! Motivation - reading about others passing on here and their experiences 

Might seem like A LOT of resources, but I never got too deep on any of them and recognized the steady mix of all of them is the right formula. Whatever it takes to get your MIND RIGHT 🙆‍♂️

Night before exam: played Fortnite from 9:30 pm to 11 pm.  Test was scheduled at 8am, with a 7:30 am check-in. Woke up at 5am to drink coffee and play YT videos in the background (morning listening) with drag and drop questions for a final refresher.   

Random: got an email from PMI that I passed on Wednesday just before 10am that I overlooked the entire day.  Didn't read the congratulations email until Thursday 4:00 am LOL.   Celebrated with cake and beer and a quick trip to Mexico 🇲🇽 to celebrate success 🍻🎂🍻🎂🍻

So I’m relatively new to having agoraphobia. I’ve not been officially diagnosed by the doctor due to the crippling state of the UK healthcare system- especially for mental health- especially for men’s mental health. 

But it’s obvious I’ve got it. 

I haven’t left the house for longer than an hour since October 2024, and I haven’t left the house point blank since before Christmas. I can’t. I won’t. 

Now I’ve never had a good relationship with my parents, especially my step-mum. We’re talking about the woman who told me I was attention seeking when I told her “I’m su*cidal and need help”. 

But that was years ago, and although we’ve been low contact since I moved out, we’ve been on better terms. 

She knows I’m going through this, and in a moment of desperation, I asked her for help. I had no food in the home, and the only money I had was in cash- so I couldn’t order anything in. 

I simply asked if she could pick up like 4-5 things and I’d give her the cash at the door. Her business is around the corner from my home so it wouldn’t be out of her way. 

Originally she said yes, and we worked out a time and a date etc. but when it came to the morning of when she was supposed to come round, she asks me to come with her. “Can you come with me in the car? We can stop off at the coffee drive through and I’ll put £10 towards your shopping”. 

Wtf. 

I politely declined, thanked her for her offer, and explained what my boundaries were and why I had them. No biggie right? Wrong. 

This led to her telling me I was dramatic, giving me attitude, guilt tripping me because I’m not visiting my grandma (why by the way my step mum doesn’t even like), and so on so forth. 

I ended up telling her not to come round, and that I would sort it out myself. 

I don’t know what I did wrong? What did I say that was so offensive to her? Why is my mental health either not important, inconvenient or just simply offensive to her? 

Not to mention, she said “everyone’s been talking, everyone’s worried, everyone has their opinions. But no one will talk to you because this is how you act”. 

Explaining my boundaries? Politely declining? Offering to just sort out something else as not to be an inconvenience? How is that me acting out? 

I’m literally a nineteen year old mentally ill guy living with his fiancé with no financial support or mental health care. I’m not trying to excuse myself from responsibility, but I think I’m doing pretty damn well considering the circumstances. 

Any tips on how to navigate this situation are welcome, or any agoraphobia guidance in general. ",1,1736524647.0,Agoraphobia,0,1.0,False

So what happens at this meetup?

Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 7 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders -22:30). Currently we are averaging 15-25 people turning up.

Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?

No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.

Can I come along?

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

I'm ********* is it OK if I come along?

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Location/Time: Latymers, W6 8BS / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00

I’m wondering if anyone knows the Belgian pop/R&B artist Rosalie Mona? She gained recognition in the early 2010s when she released her debut album Parts of Her Life\*,\* featuring the hit song Black Coffee, No Sugar.

I used to be a huge fan of hers and downloaded every song from the album onto my phone. But then, all of a sudden, all her music disappeared from the internet, and her social media accounts were gone. To this day, 14 years later, I have absolutely no idea what happened to her.

Does anyone know if she’s still making music, possibly under a different name? Even the page of the label she was signed to was deleted, which I found very suspicious.

Maybe Belgian or French fans know more about her since I don’t think she was well-known outside of Europe. If anyone has an update, please let me know!

1hy7dku,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1hy7dku/cruise_experience/,Cruise experience,"If you are considering going on a MSC cruise here are some things you should know from someone who is being honest. This is our first cruise and we did not purchase the drink package
Before embarking:
1. False advertising online, Black Friday deal 2 for 1 drink package was not accurate
2. Poor customer service when dealing with existing reservations, vague and no response to inquiries (could write a whole post on this)
The voyage:
1. Hidden costs- hold will be put on EACH card registered for 250 USD or 380 CAD with out warning before the ship even departs- no warning about this
2. Hotel fees- this is hidden on the website but common knowledge to cruisers- around 16 dollars USD a day- also charged on the first day before guests even get service
3. Buffet- the food is not great. The pizza saves the day. Hot and fresh from lunch until late night. However the other food is repurposed a little too much. Lunch time has the best food. Be prepared to not use the washroom for awhile and maybe bring laxatives. My boyfriend looked pregnant by the end of the trip and he never has issues. There is free juice (diluted as hell), tea, coffee and water in the buffet but no soda (that will be extra)
4. Customer service- no one can seem to answer questions, I felt like there was a general lack of knowledge and coupled with the language barrier this was difficult (I’m English speaking) but the workers do work really hard
5. Drink package- buy ahead if anything, due to unfortunate events (removing the easy plus package with no warning) we did not purchase a drink package because it was $400 each, on board there was easy plus available for 75 USD a day and despite boarding in the late afternoon we were unable to get it for only 3 days of our cruise (4 night cruise)- all packages had to be for all people for all days regardless of when you buy it but it was only available on the first day of the cruise- I’m not a big drinker so I did not want to be forced to get the package just because the person I was with wanted it
6. You don’t need the drink package if it’s out of your budget- many 2 for 1 cocktail offers at night- also at the ports (not private island) cheap drinks and $5 bottles of rum
7. Ocean Cay Private Island- more like open your wallet land- they set the price for everything. Do not buy the umbrellas or chairs, there are so many free ones on the island don’t be fooled by other Redditors. As for excursions not sure where the sea lions would be located the island is a man made island. It’s still under construction and gives an eerie fake feeling. Also feels like you’re always being watched. There is buffet food there as well. 2 days there was a bit much, try to pick a cruise with less if possible. Go to the far side of the island it’s a 15 minute walk and avoid the man made “lagoon”
8. For sale- everything is for sale- constant up charging. At times feels like you have not even paid to be here already. Will take your photos ask you to buy them later. Want pop buy the non alcoholic drink package for over 30 a day. Want the nice pool you’ll have to be a yacht club member. There is also a lady who gives free charms and bracelets. She is lovely but sat through a presentation over an hour (which was marketed as 15 min) where she said the only reason we came to the Bahamas was to shop, god bless her though it was just really funny and she is nice
9. Ports- get away from the boat- Nassau specific- you don’t need to pay for a driver or an over priced excursion. This was the best part of our trip and we walked 17 minutes to historic sites and the beach. I felt safe as a women and the locals were very kind- we were told by MSC staff that the island was not safe and to only go to the places on the map provided (jewelry stores)
10. Privacy- the workers will come into your room without warning if you’re not in your room
11. Water- the only free water is at the restaurant and buffet. Buffet water is warm
12. Inconsistent drink prices- the same drink will be different costs at different locations
13. Theme nights- I bought outfits for 4 theme nights the app suggested there would be but the only theme night was white nights
14. Security- we were expecting really strict security when boarding as per other Reddit posts but this was not the same- able to bring my water bottle in full no problem
15. Disembarkation- we were given a sheet that said our floor departed at 8, however a worker banged on our door earlier saying we were supposed to be out and acted like we were dumb
Overall felt there was lack of transparency and clarity and questions could not be answered consistently or well

Pros- while we found some things very surprising we did enjoy our cruise and have learned a lot from our experience. The staff is very friendly. The scheduled parties and events are really fun (white party, karaoke, welcome party, lighthouse party). The other cruisers were nice and in good spirits. Easy to get on and off at the ports. Cruise card was super easy to use and ready when we arrived, make sure you put your card on it with the app for convenience. There is soft serve ice cream in the afternoon in the buffet despite this being advertised as costing more it’s free.",1,1736524121.0,MSCCruises,1,0.6,False

The spot has a flight of stairs and when u walk down yoh can see us fishijg. because it’s not an actual address, i have to put in the house address that’s above the stairs and when the uber guy comes i ask him if he could walk down the stairs and hand me the food. i’ve never had any problems until this one guy. 

it was nighttime and i was ordering my friend and her family coffees as we were staying overnight and needed the energy. i placed my order and when my delivery driver picked it up he called me and asked me what the special delivery note was and i told him if he could there’s a flight of stairs when he comes to the address , if he could walk down the stairs and hand us the drinks it would be great, he said no worries and hung up the phone. 

he arrives and he rings me saying that he’s outside the house, but my friend answered the phone and reminded him that there’s a flight of stairs and if he could walk down them that would be great. he began to swear at my friend saying that she is completely capable of climbing up the stairs and grabbing the drinks herself or was she that much of a “fat bitch” she can’t. i heard what he said as it was in speaker and i told him that i was sorry and that she hadn’t taken her medication so her mind was all over the place, and i proceeded to tell him that i’ll meet him at the top. 

i go up the stairs with my friend to find the drinks left on the stairs and him in his turned on but stopped car abit more down. i jogged up to his car and asked him to pull his window down. i then grabbed him by his shirt and proceeded to ask him who the fuck did he think he was talking to a woman like that, and if that’s how his mother raised him. he kept quiet so i slapped him across his face and told him to apologise like a man since he can talk to a girl like that but can’t talk to me like that. he put his head down and said sorry, i said not good enough buddy, look up to her and say sorry. he said sorry and i let him go. he drove off, i picked up the coffees and went down the stairs with my friend.

AMA,"សូមជំរាបសួរពុកម៉ែបងប្អូនទាំងឣស់គ្នា។ Like many Khmer living abroad, it's been my lifelong goal to become a Cambodian citizen and own property someday. That dream has finally come true after months of patience, paperwork, and perseverance! Without writing an essay, I'll try to summarize the entire process and answer questions in the comments below. Please feel free to chime in if you see any incorrect statements or areas of improvement.

# TLDR

In general, it is much easier to get paperwork done outside of Phnom Penh (when possible). The fees are lower, there isn't as much red tape, and provincial officials are less strict compared to the capital. Here is the sequence of events that I followed:

1. Get a Khmer **Birth Certificate**
2. Be entered into a **Residence/Family Book**
3. Apply for a **Khmer National Identity Card**
4. Upon receiving the above, **confirm the documents** (បញ្ជាក់) and get certified copies
5. You will need to state your **marital status as single** (លិខិតបញ្ជាក់ភាពនៅលីវ); more on this later
6. Search for property, negotiate price, and sign a **Contract of Sale** outlining terms and conditions
7. Transfer the **Property Title** (ប្លង់) from the seller's name to yours

Please note that I am not an immigration lawyer or real estate agent. Your experience *will* be different from mine—I can almost guarantee it. The goal is to share information so others can avoid the shenanigans that are common when dealing with the government bureaucracy.

More importantly, I hope this post will prevent fellow Khmer repats from getting ripped off. You don't need to spend thousands on 'special' or 'unique' services. Especially for something you are legally eligible for (and locals get for free). My National Identity Card was delivered in 2 business days for only $200!

[Official press release regarding Cambodian Identity Card applications and renewals](https://preview.redd.it/z07wrrg7t1ce1.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=49f30f7379ac0baabca82fad051c0439f484125d)

# Citizenship by Birthright

If one of your parents is Khmer (they don't even need to be a citizen), then you are entitled to Cambodian citizenship. Here is the Kingdom of Cambodia law stating so under section [Law on Nationality, Chapter II, Article 4:](https://www.refworld.org/legal/legislation/natlegbod/1996/en/13911)

>1. Shall obtain Khmer nationality/citizenship regardless of the place of birth for:

>\-any legitimate child who is born from a parent (a mother or father) who has Khmer nationality/citizenship

Before reading any further, you need to understand that legal applications and processes in Cambodia are not as clearly defined when compared to Western countries. Therefore, you must be persistent and mentally prepared to deal with *a lot* of obstacles, runarounds, and delays. If you are not a patient person, then don't bother pursuing this endeavor. Murphy's Law is the default state in the Kingdom of Wonder!

Having relatives in Cambodia who are willing to assist with this ordeal will help a ton. If you can speak Khmer, that is even better. If you can read/write, then the process will be a cakewalk. Money talks in Cambodia, so brush up on your mother tongue—Khmer, not US Dollars. Get that coffee money ready and let's dive right in!

# Step 1 - Khmer Birth Certificate

Many of you were probably born in a refugee camp with no birth certificate, or have birth documents from another country. Despite this fact, a Khmer Birth Certificate (សំបុត្រកំណើត ឬសំបុត្របញ្ជាក់កំណើត) is a prerequisite to obtain Khmer citizenship. Seems like circular logic, doesn't it?

[Sample Khmer Birth Certificate](https://preview.redd.it/rffzuaqfz2ce1.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=464c31b404e8e50fb3d171f632655e823197e5b0)

The easiest way to apply for a Khmer Birth Certificate is to return to your family's village and go to the Commune Office (សាលាឃុំ). There, you need to prove to the Commune Chief, or មេឃុំ, that your parents are former residents or have roots in that village. This is where having relatives helps tremendously!

The Chief in my ancestors' commune happens to be distantly related, so his staff produced the birth certificate with no questions asked **(cost was $25 in coffee money). Processing time was a couple business days.** They listed my place of birth the same as my parents. This is similar to Bong Savi's situation, who documented his [Khmer Passport journey on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w0ayoyLElY) I highly recommend you watch the video to see the types of roadblocks he encountered!

# Step 2 - Residence/Family Book

A Residence Book (សៀវភៅស្នាក់នៅ) or Family Book (សៀវភៅគ្រួសារ) is an official document that lists all members of a household. In order to get your citizenship, you need to be entered into a Residence/Family Book. Since I assume your parent(s) no longer live in Cambodia, it is much easier to be added to an existing Book of a relative rather than creating a new Book for yourself.

Entry into a Book is done at the Administrative Police Station, which is usually located near a Commune Office. Lucky for me, the Commune Chief was able to help handle this with his counterparts. **Cost was similar to above ($25) and processing time was same day.​** In the future, I plan on starting my own Family Book; this is much easier once you have all the required documents.

[Sample Family\/Residence Books](https://preview.redd.it/9j31o1emw2ce1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&s=56ea9723a742d01ad5782dc9fa98aad65b196ec5)

# Step 3 - Khmer Identity Card

This ID card, known in Khmer as the អត្តសញ្ញាណប័ណ្ណ, is proof of your Cambodian citizenship. Note that it expires 10 years from the date of issuance. You need to renew it *at least 180 days* before the expiration date. Otherwise, the process becomes much more complicated!

There are many places to have an ID card processed, but the most direct route is to apply at the **Department of Khmer Identification Card** (នាយកដ្ឋានអត្តសញ្ញាណប័ណ្ណសញ្ជាតិខ្មែរ) in [Chbar Ampov](https://maps.app.goo.gl/itD2skwznSznHXdE9). Life will be much easier if you procure the services of a *fixer,* who will help fill out the application form and hold your hand through the intake process.

There will be dozens of other people in the queue, and the office is a disorganized mess. If you can speak Khmer, don't be afraid to ask for instructions and next steps. Otherwise, you could be sitting there for hours as the sequence of processing stations is not obvious.

After fingerprinting, wait for your name to be called. A man in military uniform will interview you to confirm your identity, the nature of your application, your intentions for obtaining citizenship, your parents' background, etc. They may ask for your foreign passport as well, which they will photocopy (if the fixer didn't arrange for that already).

After noting identifying marks (moles, scars, etc.) and measuring your height, you head into another room to have your data entered into the computer system. You may be asked similar questions by a second official before sitting down to have your picture taken. Make sure that all information on screen is correct when asked to confirm. The fixer will be able to help if you are unable to read Khmer. Finally, you will receive a paper stub which will be used to pick-up your ID. Now comes the waiting game!

Standard processing is free of charge, but can take 3 to 6 months (sometimes even longer). **For around $100, that can be shortened to one week. If you're really in a hurry, you can expedite this to 2-3 business days for around $200.** Make sure to agree on the cost and wait time with your fixer before handing over any money.

In the end, you will receive a chip card with your picture and information on the front. And that officially makes you a citizen of the Kingdom of Cambodia!

# Step 4 - Confirmation of Official Documents

Once you receive your Khmer Identity card, return to your commune (or wherever your listed address is) and have the local officials 'confirm' the documents (បញ្ជាក់). It is a good idea to have certified copies made at this point since you will need them later for buying property and other legal transactions. The copies need to be stamped and​ physically signed by an authorized person.

* Certified Copy of Birth Certificate (សេចក្តីចម្លងសំបុត្របញ្ជាក់កំណើត), at commune level
* Certified Copy of Family Book, at commune level
* Certified Copy of National ID Card, at district level

At this point, you should be on a first-name basis with the commune's clerk (ស្មៀន). This is the person who gets paid to stamp official documents, and it is customary to give some coffee money. **$25 is more than enough** for the certified copies and document outlined in Step 5 below.

The hardest part for me was getting a signature from the District Governor (ចៅហ្វាយស្រុក), who is a very busy person. Luckily, one of my relatives is a police officer and was able to track him down for a quick stroke of the pen. **Coffee money for his time was around $25**, if I recall correctly.

# Step 5 - Certificate of Single Status

Lastly, this document is required for being the sole owner of a property. In Cambodia, both spouses must be listed on the Property Title. Since you aren't registered in the état civil—or marriage registry—you are legally single. This document proves that, for all intents and purposes.

[Sample Certificate of Single Status](https://preview.redd.it/s65dkmv0z2ce1.png?width=2268&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2ec5962a88eee64af25cdcce9fd2e973430a186)

The above document and certified copies need to be signed by the Commune Chief (មេឃុំ), so it makes sense to include it with the package in Step 4 above. I managed to get all this paperwork **completed on the same day**, but your mileage may vary. Congratulations—you now have all the required documentation to legally own real estate in Cambodia!

# Step 6 - Locate and Close on a Property

This process deserves a post on its own! My main advice would be to negotiate, and negotiate hard. The asking price for Khmer real estate is often much higher than the seller is willing to let it go for. Think market-haggling mentality, but with a lot more zeroes.

Also, make sure that the seller is the legal owner of said property and is authorized to sell it. Counterfeit land titles exist, and even authentic ones can have liens/legal issues which prevent them from being transferred. Ask to see the hard title, or ប្លង់រឹង, *in person​.* If you are able to, have someone at the​ Land Office (សុរិយាដី) check the serial number for authenticity and/or issues. Again, I am not a lawyer and you should seek advice from a qualified individual. There are countless stories of people getting scammed on property deals, both local and foreigners.

The Contract of Sale should clearly define terms of payment and other binding conditions. Please contact a professional for help with this. There is a lot of money at stake, and the risk is especially high when dealing with a stranger on the other side of the world. In my case, my cousin helped make sure everything during this step was legit.

The terms of sale should also outline a payment structure based on receival of the Property Title. It is not uncommon for transfers to be held up for all sorts of reasons; without the Title in your name you don't officially own anything. There is potential for bad things to happen here, but let's not get into that.

# Step 7 - Certificate of Identification of Real Estate Owners

This is the Holy Grail—the piece of paper worth its weight in gold! **The Certificate of Identification of Real Estate Owners**, known colloquially as a ប្លង់. This Title (or deed) proves who owns a property. It can take months—and sometimes years—to successfully transfer ownership from buyer to seller.

I do not recommend you attempt to navigate this mess yourself. There are agents who can help with the convoluted transfer process. In fact, people make a living off this line of work. They are called អ្នករត់ប្លង់, or literally a 'Title legwork​ person'. A competent agent should have you fingerprint all the necessary paperwork beforehand and submit the file on your behalf. **You do not need to be in the country if everything goes smoothly.**

Thankfully, it is common for sellers to be responsible for the entire transfer process as part of a real estate deal. They include fees, taxes, and commissions into the asking price of the property. In Khmer, this is referred to as កាត់ប្លង់ជូន, where the seller hands over the completed package to you. There's a lot of trust involved here, so please do your due diligence.

In my case, I had family who were familiar with the process and had connections at different government departments (Castradal Office; Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC), etc.). My cousin's friend helped រត់ប្លង់, and their fee was $1250 USD. I've heard that people can do it for less, and sometimes even more. But it's best to go with a trustworthy party who has experience with these types of dealings.

[Sample Certificate of Identification of Real Estate Owners \(front and back\)](https://preview.redd.it/tnyh3xkuc4ce1.png?width=1968&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fe574a8e12826985d3e0a3b320429b00e7a48f9)

After thumbprinting a dozen documents and submitting the paperwork, it took about 6 weeks for the transfer to be completed. A form titled *Vente Definitive*, or លក់ផ្ដាច់, confirms that the sale was final. My name is now listed underneath the seller's on the backside of the Certificate above. And that means I am the legal owner of this piece of real estate!

# Conclusion

There you have it: a (long) summary of how I obtained Cambodian citizenship! As mentioned earlier, getting your Khmer National Identity Card should not cost thousands. At most, you're looking at a few hundred dollars (with the right connections). The entire process can be done in a couple of weeks, but for many Khmer travelers that isn't enough time. Luckily, the ID can be delivered to a relative based on your instructions. Just be prepared to leave some coffee money for the police officer who drops it off!

I will probably make a more detailed post about the real estate deal separately. The amount of paperwork, thumbprints, and stamps was absolutely mindboggling. It took about 2 months from agreeing on the sale price to receiving the Title in my name. There were many, many sleepless nights. In the end, all that stress was worth it. **I now have a home-away-from-home and can replant roots in the Motherland.**",11,1736523819.0,cambodia,1,1.0,False

Alia had to fight nearly every instinct to just walk out and close the door. “G, what’s going on?”



“Looks like extra Alias to me.” Greylock said. Alia could have sworn that her tone was a little smarmy.



“I can *see* that Greylock, any idea why?” Alia looked at the panel again, and saw that a timer had started. They had about twelve hours before the timer completed. A waking timer?



“They’re… spare captains. In case you get killed or… incapacitated.” Greylock paused while Alia’s face made a range of expressions, settling on horror. “It makes sense, Alia. I can’t do everything on the ship, and you’re a lot more… easily destroyed than I am.”



“But, I was in hibernation for the ride too, Greylock, why would I be more likely to die?” She whispered and backed out of the room. She really did not like looking at herself, and in the back of her mind, wondered why.



“Well, that has to do more with our actual mission. Come on back up to the lounge. I’ll keep an eye on them, there is no reason to sit and stare at them thawing for half an day.”



While walking back up to the lounge area, Alia tried to process what she saw. Her memories told her that she had been sundered into one hundred and thirty three copies, but when she saw it in person it was very upsetting. How did she deal with this during training? Did she just get used to it? What happened to her memories? “G?” She said, as she walked.



“Yes Alia?”



“I shouldn’t be this… freaked out about what’s going on, should I? If I had my memories, what we’re doing is…” She hesitated. “Normal?”



“Given what you can remember, I can see why you keep getting startled, but no, this is all… mostly going according to plan. At least, the plan that Colonial Authority developed before we left.”



“Okay so, help me to remember. What are we? What are we doing?”



“Go get a coffee and sit in the lounge, and I’ll tell you.”



Alia grabbed a cup - as well as a thermos bottle with more coffee - and sat in ‘her’ chair in the lounge, and Greylock explained their mission. 



Alia and Greylock were originally sent out by the Colonial Authority to set up a… frontier outpost. It was going to be staffed by trained soldiers, but still some work of colonization was to be done. The idea was to set the borders of humanity early, before any other sapients came in to claim locations. Additionally if it had turned out that the plane that they were sent to was already occupied then it fell to the people in hibernation to… resolve that issue. There was no plans in place for cohabitation. 



Tartarus was part of that goal. If it was determined that the system they were braking towards was occupied, Tartarus would be activated, some of the supplies would be repurposed - with the difference made up in ‘liberated’ supplied from the current occupants - and the system would be captured and the current occupants removed. 



“I don’t know how I feel about that.” Alia said as she poured more coffee. “On the one hand, it’s kind of horrifying that we were planning on obliterating any existing occupants when we arrived. On the other, I can kind of… see their reasoning?”



“Their reasoning makes sense if you assume a kind of baseline zero-sum pro human thinking. Something that my records seem to indicate was the Colonial Authority’s milieu.” Greylock said, sighing. Alia always thought it odd that G could sigh, but it was very expressive and a good way for her to demonstrate feelings that could be missed because she had no body language. “Regardless, about fifty years into our original mission, we received new orders. We were to begin a long, lazy orbit of the Sol system at a few dozen light years out and… wait.”



“Wait? For what?”



“Wait to be deployed.” Greylock said. “I’m only speculating at this point, but I would guess that’s when FTL was developed. We had become a weapon without a target, and rather than recall us, change our mission to pure colonization or… destroy us, it was determined that since we were all - except me - in hibernation it would be fine to just let us sit and rot for a few millennia.” The bitterness in Greylock’s voice was coming out as she spoke. “We were inconvenient, but too useful to destroy.”



“That explains why we’re kitted out like this, but why were you set to begin braking towards Halcyon before we learned about the Jimbos?”



“That I don’t know, Alia. I think it was part of the message that was corrupted. I wasn’t able to reconstruct all of the data; I used what was there… plus some lateral thinking to figure out what’s going on.”



“So, someone turned us towards Halcyon *before* we knew about the Jimbos? Why?”



“It’s all speculation at this point, Alia. Once we arrive - if we survive - we can ask. I have a hunch that we were turned as a weapon by another human party to attack Halcyon. Our original mission does not specifically prevent us from attacking other human residents of the system we are pointed at.”



Alia stared at nothing while she thought. They were a weapon, that didn’t surprise her at this point. It explained a lot about what they were carrying and what she knew. Tartarus was more of a… configuration change than something that they could use against an alien invader. “Uh G, how did James know about Tartarus?”



“He said he messaged the ‘Terran Authority’ whoever they are, and they told him about it. Since they have FTL, it is reasonable to assume they have some kind of FTL communication. An ansible, or beacons, or something. It’s not like we’re stealthy. He could see our drive flame for months. That’s more than enough time to message someone and ask what the hell we are.”



“That still doesn’t explain-” Alia started to say, and then there was booming noise from outside the door to the lounge. Long and loud and  echoing in the ship. “G, what the fuck was that?”



“Scanning. Uh, Alia? I’ve lost contact with the Tartarus section of the ship.”



“What do you *mean* ‘lost contact’?” Alia said as she stood quickly and ran to Command. “Are the Alia’s awake? The timer said they had 12 hours, it’s only been a few.”



“It appears the timers may have been lying.” Greylock said. “I will attempt to lock down the ship.” At that, a piercing loud siren started playing all throughout the ship and Alia could hear the clang of pressure doors being slammed into place. “I can also detect evidence of firearm discharge. Chemical markers in the air. That would lend credence to the theory that those booms we heard were firearms.”



“Firearms?” Alia said, as she buckled into her command seat. “Where did the Alias get guns? Also, are they shooting at each other or towards us?”



“Unknown. One or both of them have severed my sensors. Thermal cameras indicate they haven’t left the Tartarus section of the ship yet.”



“Do I have any weapons here?” Alia had placed the pistol she found in Tartarus in her cabin; she thought it was silly to walk around armed when she was alone on the whole ship.



“Yes, over by the communications suite.” 



Alia unbuckled and made her way over there. Sure enough, in a cabinet under the communications suite station was a locker that contained two pistols, two submachine guns and a fair amount of ammunition for both. The weapons looked like they had been placed there during departure and were covered in a protective gooey creme. “Ugh, G, these have *storage goo* on them. How am I supposed to use these?”



“Wipe off the storage creme as best as you can, and cycle the action a few times. There should be a cleaning kit in there as well.”



Behind the weapons there was a simple field cleaning kit. Grumbling, Alia cleaned a submachine gun as well as she could, concentrating on the action and the barrel. When she was done she was… relatively sure it would fire but it sure wasn’t fun to hold. “Yuck. I’m going to need to boil my hands when this is all done.” She said as she slotted a magazine. “Will it even fire? Will the propellant still be good after all this time?”



“I fear you will get the opportunity to check soon.” Grelock said. “They have exited Tartarus and are working their way up ship.”



“Can’t you stop them, G? Increase thrust, or cut it off entirely?”



“I am going to vector the thrust and fire the chemical rockets. Please remain buckled in.” Greylock said. “This will be… unpleasant.”



Immediately, Alia felt the change. Greylock had started by cutting thrust entirely and just as she started to feel weightless, the thrust came back on hard at an angle, nearly forty five degrees from where it was before. Just as she was starting to get over that, the two steps fired, at the same angle, pressing her into the seat. The vibration increased dramatically, and Alia could see out of the corner of her eye some of the stations light up red. In the distance the acceleration alarm hooted insistently. When the chems burnt out, The main drive thrusted again, but this time Greylock was vectoring it in random directions and increasing the thrust. The muted rumble had transformed into a ragged roar that made her chest hurt. Alia felt incredibly heavy, and felt her legs to numb. “How… high are you… thrusting, G?” She said, grunting with each breath. 



“I am thrusting at three and one half gees. I believe I have them pinned down just outside of one of the exercise rooms.” She said “I will- oh biscuits.” Greylock said.



“What? Talk to me, G” 



“One or both of the Alias has opened up a service panel, they’re attempting to gain control of me.”



“What? How? I needed to get to the console to initiate a reboot.”



“They appear to have knowledge you do not, or have forgotten.” Greylock said, her voice sounding distracted. “Please wait whil-” Grelock’s voice was cut off, and the random drive thrusting stopped. Curiously the lights and HVAC stayed on, which Alia took to mean it wasn’t a complete power cut. 



“Hey Alia,” The voice was coming over the PA that Greylock used. *Her* voice. “I’ve locked G out of comms and a few other systems for now. They’re on automatic, and should be fine for a few hours. We need to talk.”

1hy76ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hy76ck/volatile_workouts_in_the_beginning/,Volatile Workouts in the Beginning? ,"Hi Decaf Community! I've been on the journey of dropping coffee on & off now for the last four years. I've probably explored dropping the habit with intentionality 4 or 5 times at this point, but it's this most recent exploration that I feel myself committing to it entirely. I'm only 10 days in, but can articulate with full assurance that I don't want to go back to it. 

All of that being said, the only drawback I'm encountering right now is inconsistency in my workouts. For example, yesterday I was able to complete a 10 mile run with ease and a steady heart rate. I run pretty regularly, accomplishing 9-10 mile runs about 5 days a week. Today, however, I could barely manage 2 miles & my motivation to supplement with strength training was nonexistent. I used to fuel my workouts entirely on coffee, oftentimes consuming a 24 oz. black coffee prior to any cardio. Obviously dropping the habit is going to have some immediate affects on my ability to dive right into a workout, but I was wondering if any of you may have had a similar coffee x fitness relationship, and if/when you were able to find some recalibration after giving up coffee?

I travel about once a month. When I travel for 1-2 days - One Bagging with my Synik 30 works, but if I travel more than 1-2 days I like to bring my small carry-on roller. I usually fly with dress shoes in my bag and wear Tennis Shoes. That setup doesn't quite work with a one-bagger situation...

I loved my Synik 30 and the loved Tom Bihn line when I first got it. My ""Travel Tray"" is the coolest thing I ever bought and I refuse to travel anywhere without it (It carries my phone charger, then when I get home from the hotel its my catch all for my wallet, hotel key, car keys, etc). Now I find myself wanting something that is more of a carry-on that isn't for my one-bag situation. I also want something that looks more professional and less like a balloon. This could be my take my laptop to a coffee shop bag or it may be the bag that compliments my roller luggage and goes underneath the seat with me on an airplane.

Here is what I'm looking for:

* Something that will hold the following:
   * 1 day worth of clothes (I always carry one day of clothes in a packing cube. Like the idea of this bag still working as an overnight bag. This could also hold a jacket or an extra layer of clothes.)

   * Sunglasses
   * Airpods
   * iPad
   * Notepad
   * 13in Laptop
   * Bose Headphones
   * Tom Bihn Travel Tray
   * Tom Bihn First Aid
   * Some other Tom Bihn Pouches

* Professional Looking

* Not overly bulky looking
   * Synik when I onebag looks huge
* Organization
   * I don't want a black hole of a bag. I like to find what I'm looking for quickly. One of the things I love about my Synik is how organized I am

I'm the type of guy that likes to be prepared, so no matter where I go I want to have a few extra cables, my first aid kit, etc. Some of these smaller bags lack organization or just don't seem big enough to hold a day of clothes. Some feel like a black hole and are too big for what I'm looking for (and I already have the Synik). If the Synik was more professional looking I would be tempted to use it as my EDC/CarryOn, but it just doesn't fit the aesthetic.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

\- Generally what I do -

I've had my Gaggia for 2.5 years - I set up a shot with 16g of coffee in an 16/18g basket and I have it dialed in pretty well.  I like the taste of a shot pulled at 1:2.5 / 1:3 at about 35-45 seconds.

My main technique is the 2 to 5 minute warm-up with a cold machine - Wait for the light to come on, Wait for the light to turn off, Wait for the light to come back on, pull my shot.

I always hear that you should let your boiler heat up completely pretty much the 10 to 15 minute mark, problem is for me, That's when I start not liking the taste because of the smoothness and sweetness goes away IMO.

When it comes to warm-up time though I get this results.  
2 min warm up time - 16g / 40 seconds / 45g of coffee  
5 min warm up time - 16g / 40 seconds / 40g of coffee  
10 min warm up time - 16g / 40 seconds / 35g of coffee  
15 min warm up time - 16g / 40 seconds / 30g of coffee

I don't know, maybe I should grind less finer and see at the 15 minute warm-up time the smoothness comes back -  Anyways, cheers",2,1736523388.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False
1hy736t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tomasino/comments/1hy736t/tips_for_3rd_year_medtech_2nd_sem_edition/,Tips for 3rd Year MedTech: 2nd Sem Edition!,"Apologies if I couldnt reply for quite some time, I forgot the password to this account hehe.

Congrats on making it out of the first semester of tired (third) year! For those who have chosen to drop the sem, became irreg, or debarred, I have full sympathies and it is understandable. May you find guidance in these trying times.

For those who still remain in the fight, congratulations as the hardest part is over (in my opinion). Due to many requests, I'll be making a continuation of this series. 

General tips:
- Like I said, the hardest part is over. In 2nd sem, you'll only have 5 subjects to deal with meaning 5 days a week na lang kayo papasok. Compared to before, there's definitely a lot of more room to breathe. 
- If your goal is to hit latin honors (laude), this is your time bumawi as the subjects are more managable and the workload is a lot less as compared to first semester
- If history repeats itself, generally fewer students fail compared to 1st sem by A LOT
- But as always, never get overconfident and excert 101% effort in your 1st and 2nd shiftings. Because if I remember correctly, all shiftings became noticeably difficult to pass in the 3rd shifting
- You'll have 5 main subjects to look out for: Hema 2, CC 2, ImmunoSero, ImmunoHema (Blood Bank), and AUBF. As usual, each have their own lecture and laboratory and trust me when I say it is not as tiring and hassle as it was in first semester (looking at you Bacte Lab)
- If you listened to me before, you'll learn by now how important your professors are in determining your fate (aka grade). Alam niyo na kung kanino dapat kayo makikinig at kung kanino hindi. By now, dapat alam niyo na quiz style nila. If not, ask from other sections.
- Speaking of other sections, you'll know how important connections are by now. It may be unfair to those who don't have, but consider this as a life lesson. Those who choose to socialize and make connections will always end up with the upper hand, regardles kung gaano ka katalino, with the excep tion of being genuinely smart and working hard
- Baka lang mabigla kayo, pero our batch was only given 5 days to rest after 2nd sem tapos diretsyo internship na agad. 
- Aside from wanting to pass, make sure than you have a good foundation on 2nd sem subjects as ImmunoSero and AUBF is part of MTAP 1 which is difficult to pass. 
- Compared to our mockboards, mas mahirap talaga ang 3rd year shiftings. Pero ang maganda is kapag naaral mo nang maayos ang 3rd year, onting skim lang ng notes mo makakapasa ka ng MTAP 

*HEMATOLOGY 2*
[LECTURE]
- Compared to your Hema 1, this is actually more difficult as the topics are predominantly memorization. If in Hema 1 you can answer most questions based on the increase and decrease, here it's not as simple. You'll be focusing on leukemias and hemostasis and most of it is really memorization.
- As usual, Rodak's, Ciulla, and Turgeon will be your BEST FRIEND when it comes to answering your shiftings. Alam mo na kung bakit. However, DO NOT rely solely on review questions. Pagdating ng 3rd shifting, yayanig buong mundo mo sa hirap kapag ka memorize nang memorize lang ng answers. Consider this your warning.
- Mga hawak ni Sir Cla lang ang magkakagusto sa hema 2
- Rodak's may actually be really too lengthy kapag dumating na kayo sa leukemias. I suggest focusing information highlighted sa powerpoints and using Rodak's to fill in the gaps. Sir Cla may give some reclecs and I HIGHLY recommend that you watch it kahit medyo nakakaantok (sorry sir labyu)
- Sa mga mahilig gumawa ng tabulations, promise worth it sobra. You'll be tackling many leukemias and it's important to differentiate them based on their findings.
- CASE STUDIES are a must in knowing how to study leukemias. In the case studies seen in Rodak's, you'll notice the hints of the disease its referring too and that's the absolute key in studying lengthy topics sa hema
- When you reach hemostasis (3rd shifting), sobrang fast paced na ng discussion here. Less than a month lang siguro to ma didiscuss and very crucial ang topic na to. If you can, flashcards and mnemonics will help you out a lot as you really need to master this. To give you an idea, dito yung mga clotting factors mo and tests like PT, PTT, Clotting time, Hemophilia, etc. Information on hemostasis is actually very 1:1 and straight forward, so truly nemorization din talaga.
- Compared to Hema 1, medyo mahirap ma-grasp yung ibang concepts. There's a lot of guides on youtubes and I recommend to watch it BEFORE studying the topic. However, use it as an introduction lang, iba ang tinuturo sa medtech and medicine. 

[LABORATORY]
- Surpisingly, same lang ang laboratory from first sem. Like literally same topics lang. Mauulit yung mga retics, esr, computation of RBC indices, etc. Nadagdagan lang ng onti sa coagulation studies and sa mga bleeding time, clotting time. This also plus instrumentation. Meron mga must knows dito like what does forward or side scatter measure, principle of sysmex ganun. Medyo nakakatamad aralin to promise, but must knows pa rin kasi lagi at lagi lumalabas sa shiftings.
- Like first sem, powerpoint is key! Supplement with transes if you can para sureball!
- In the third shifting, you will encounter mixing studies. Madali lang siya to be honest but again, nakakatamad aralin, pero worth a lot of points to sa 3rd shifting kaya sipagin niyo as in.
- Not much to say on laboratory and again if mahirapan kayo sa lecture, laboratory will be your saving grace

Overall, Hema 2 should not be much of a threat if you play your cards right and with the proper prof. Just make sure to study smart as its possible to focus on the wrong things due to so much info.

*CLINICAL CHEMISTRY 2*

[LEC & LAB]
- Pinagsama ko sila kasi as in same na same lang tinuturo nila no joke. Kaya sobrang gaan ng CC 2 Dahil hindi iba iba ang tanong and kung saan saan kinukuha ang questions
- Nahirapan kayo CC 1 no? Dont worry ako rin but don't worry, sobrang dali lang ng CC 2 dahil mas-straight forward siya compared to before. Like literally 1:1 information.
- You'll be encountering enzymology, blood gasses, electrolytes, and endocrinology. Sounds intimidating? Nope. Walk in the park lang yan basta aralin mo si BISHOP and RODRIGUEZ. 
- Sulit na sulit dito ang mga flashcards as madali lang talaga makabisado lahat to.
- Again, review books are seldom used in shiftings so I do not recommend to rely on them. Use them as a guide, but never your basis.
- KNOW YOUR HEMOLYSIS. Many lab tests are heavily affected by hemolysis, and some don't. You must know their corresponding result in each test.
- For bilirubin, high yield ang pag differentiate between b1 and b2, must knows talaga. This, and how bilirubin si catabolized and excreted. Yung buong pathway dapat alam and what enzymes are used. Knowledge from Hema 1 will be very useful here. Aside from this, covered here yung liver physiology. Madami must knows dito kaya talagang sulit ang flashcards.
- For enzymology, know their class, function, sources of error, methods, and especially their ISOENZYMES. When reviewing, dapat marunong mag correlated between the disease and if there is an a change (mainly increase) of the analyte. Also, zero order kinetics ginagamit sa lab, lagi yan tinatanong hehe. I recommend reading a little on enzymes if you have notes way back 2nd year biochem. Madami din electrophoresis here and dapat alam niyo ang most anodic, cathodic, and the sequence of the enzymes based on their separation. Sa pag compute ng absorbance, dapat alam kung anong enzymes add or subtract ha.
- Electrolytes. Like earlier, dapat alam ang corresponding result ng sample if hemolyzed. Aside from this, dapat alam ang most abundant X or 2nd most abundant X. Mnemonics are useful here such as in PISO: 2 potassium in, 3 sodium out. Again, must knows guys! You have to know the concept of how electrolytes are maintained in the body, especially on the analogy of bakit mas matapang ang coffee kapag onti ang tubig, and bakit mas matabang kapag marami tubig. You'll get this when you encounter the topic.
- Blood gasses. Very minor topic as hindi naman talaga to trabaho ng medtech, but still tinuturo pa rin. Madami tutorials on tiktok (yes tiktok) on how to approach this blood gasses as this is one of the topics na madali makalimutan haha. Dapat alam kung acidosis or alkalosis, metabolic or respiratory, and their compensation. Ang ginagawa dito is nagbibigay ng case scenario and interpret based on the lab findings. 
- Endocrinology. Sulit dito ang mga mahilig mag schematic diagram dahil connected bawat hormone. Dapat alam kung sino nag produce ng hormone, what activates it, and corresponding diseases. Read your rodriguez trust me. 
- Vitamins and Toxicology. Minor topics but worth a lot of points. Sa vitamins, know their corresponding disease when deficient and their other name. In Toxicology, sa totoo lang hindi ko inaral to kasi nag focus ako sa other topics since sobrang minor nito pero madaming dinidiscuss. Buti na lang worth 2-3 points lang siya at nasagutan ko kasi lumabas lang yung inaral ko. Usually, pinapa-matching type lang to parehas kaya madali lang papaano sagutan kahit na-skim mo lang siya.

Overall, CC 2 will be arguably the least of your problems this sem. Since 5 units, if goal mo mag laude dapat ma-uno mo to. This is made easier because legitimately same lang ang lec and lab. Slight dagdag lang ng tinuturo so all in all mas onti ang aaralin. Expect na yun majority of the theoretical (diseases etc) nasa lecture, and the analytical and methods will be in lab. Pero meron pa rin nag overlap between both.

*AUBF*
- Unang una sa lahat, READ YOUR STRASINGER. In all of the medtech books, strasinger is the only book that I was able to finish from top to bottom. Almost all questions will be lifted from this book. 
- AUBF is actually a really short subject as if you base in the book, talagang onti lang siya. Dahil dito, almost every review material that is given is very high yield. 
- Dito lang humihirap ang AUBF dahil onti lang ang info, madami possible lumabas. Unlike to in Hema and Bacte na merong must knows talaga, AUBF lahat dapat alam.
- Medyo madami bumagsak dito mainly dahil sa isang certain prof na madami daw pasabog sa quiz.
- I highly recommend to supplement with Ciulla, Harr, and Brunzel review questions. Kahit madami high yield na tinuturo, hinding hindi mawawala ang mga must knows. Questions as simple as minimum amount of urine and time of collection always come up.
- Sa strasinger, pag meron kayo nakita na table, automatic tatanungin yan (parang sa Rodak's lang)

[URINALYSIS]
- Memorize the urine strip by HEART. Every reaction, time, reagent, the principle, the reading, even the color, LAHAT. Sobrang high yield ng reagent strip at everything under the sun pwede tanungin. Seryoso to as in. Beware na naglalabas sila ng blank urine reagent strip and you have to memorize really everything. Mnemonics is key!
- Renal Physiology. Itaga niyo sa utak ang nasa power point dahil paulit ulit tinatanong ang fundamentals ng physio. 
- Pre-analytical considerstions. Dapat alam ang false increase and decrease in prolonged standing urine. Very basic questions, mnemonics is key and as well as knowing the rationale on why.
- Chemical examination. Sa laboratory, meron mga traditional tests used such as benedicts and SSA to screen for selective analytes. Memorize dapat ang reaction, grading, and reagents. Seryoso to ha dapat alam kung turbid, 4+, etc. Lahat ng study style ma-apply niyo para dito just do what works for you. Personally, tabulations is KEY.
- Microscopic examination. Tabulate and flashcards lang katapat dito as in. Naglabas sila sa mockboards namin ng pictures of crystals. Dapat alam niyo ang pH of urine to correlate with the type of crystal (must know kasi kahit in real life ginagamit talaga). Dapat din alam ang manner of reporting for each formed urine element dahil very basic questions often nakakalimutan.
- Try to study urinalysis as a whole dahil lahat talaga connected to one another. Ang turo kasi sa UST is very correlation based pero ang benefit dito is lahat ng sagot matatanong mo just by testmanship due to the foundation built. 
[OBF]
- Sa other bodily fluids, strasinger lang katapat niyan and powerpoint. No more. Like before, lahat pwede tanungin kasi onti lang siya per chapter. More or less, sa book lang iikot lahat ng tanong on OBF. Again, flashcards is key. 
- FOBT medyo kukuha kayo from other sources though madalas must knows lang tatanungin dito such as the principle.
- Marami tables sa strasinger on obf and lalabas at lalabas mga yun.

*IMMUNOSERO*
- IS is arguably the hardest subject sa 2nd sem. Many failed from out batch because talagang big factor kung sino prof mo. Course lead dito si ARF and just like bacte, alam niyo na. Transes are useful here and I recommend to find transes transcribed under him. If maging prof mo siya, you'll love IS due to how good he is in teaching (personal experience).
- IS is a very abstract subject and challenging ma comprehend yung concepts just by reading it. Highly recommend na mag flashcards and apply visual learning such as diagrams. 
- Marami CD markers and cytokines here. Kaya tabulation is a must when you encounter them.
- In 4th year MTAP, IS is the subject na madalas nababagsak (same with CC 1 and bacte) kaya ngayon pa lang it's important to build your foundation.
- Unfortunately, very different ang lec and lab. You have to treat them as separate subjects. If I remember correctly, 70% ang Lecture.
- Stevens will be your main book and actually halos lahat ng questions (not review questions) are pooled from here. Especially sa morse type, usually copy paste lang sila. If hindi mo prof si Arf and wala ka mapagkukunan ng notes, Stevens liligtas sayo. Madami tabulations dito and pag may naka table, lalabas at lalabas sila. Yung powerpoint kasi madalas picture kaya important magaling yung prof.
- Do not underestimate IS. Yung feeling niya is pretty similar to bacte.

[LEC/IMMUNO]
- Very abstract ang mga topics talaga kaya sobrang challenging. Maraming nakakalito na terms na madali ma interchange or hindi mapansin kapag may questions sa shiftings.
- Marami sila pampalito sa questions. Tipong pag nabasa mo yung question, mukang tama siya. However, di mo napansin na terms such as Fab and Fc pinagpalit kaya it automatically makes the statement wrong. These are the kind of questions na madalas namamali. Pero kapag maganda foundation mo you will spot these easily.
- Foundation on the 1st shifting and on the biology of the immune response is KEY. You have to master the fundamental concepts
- Medyo nahihirapan ako magbigay ng tips here kasi talagang connected lahat. Parang IQ test din kasi IS. 
- Again, yung mga tables na nasa PPT and Stevens lagi lumalabas. Warning na to sa mga binabalewala lang yung tables.
- Siguro message na lang kayo pag mahirapan kayo I'll try and help if I can

[SERO/LAB]
- Parang CC lang to, mas marami nga lang. Dapat alam ang principle, reagent, and clinical signifiance. Lab manual is key, a lot of the questions are actually based in your lab manual but some topics actually appear in Stevens.
- 3rd shifting lab is absolutely the hardest shifting I have personally encountered in all of third year. Suddenly I couldnt answer anything at all dahil sobrang different yung style of questioning (balita ko si Juicylin gumawa, hindi si Arf

*IMMUNOHEMA/BLOODBANK*
- Arguably the most core subject of all, both in practice and theory. If you plan on pursuing MedTech abroad, consider mastering BB as early as now. 
- I cannot give any other advice here rather than use MNEMONICS especially sa other blood groups. 
- Master your ABO blood group! Buong first shifting ABO lang ang usapan at hanggang 3rd shifting napakarami pa rin ng ABO so make sure to know the ins and outs of it. Mnemonics is key!
- Personally, di ko inexpect na sobrang taas ko sa mga shifting exams. Like lahat ng shiftings ko no more than 5 mistakes lagi eh deep down feel ko hindi talaga ako ready. Siguro madali lang talaga siya dahil medyo common sense din and naka base sa foundation mo.
- Harmening is actually incredibly lengthy no joke, hopefully maging prof niyo si Sir Greg dahil thanks to him hinding hindi ko nakakalimutan ang mga basics and fundamentals of blood bank. Labyu sir!
- Overall your performance in BB is based on your fundamentals on antigen-antibody complexes and mnemonics.  

Ay last one haha THESIS.
- Yung mga experimental sana ok lang kayo diyan at panindigan niyo yan. Katulad sakin, ang laki ng nagastos namin at talagang nakain yung time namin the whole sem. The only thing I can say is that START AS EARLY AS NOW. Kung pwede na kayo mag data collection or anything na basta masimulan niyo. Habang hindi pa nagkakandelecheleche lahat, try niyo tapusin na.
- Mga hindi experimental, mga survey survey lang chill lang dito puro sulat sulat lang

Instead of using Secret Wars as an excuse to merge universes, what about they make a 2 part X-Men film (maybe with some Disney+ specials featuring individual X-men showing their journey to Xavier leading up). Make these movies absolutely epic on par with Infinity war and Endgame. 

Have it take place in the past. Maybe mid 90’s like the animated series. It feels like there’s an appetite for that with the success of the animated series. Most of the X-men are teenagers. Build it up around a classic story like Fatal Attractions (even though that’s a 90’s story) but in the 616, Wolverine actually dies after getting his adamantium ripped out. The rest of the X-men are teenagers at this point. 

Anyway, there’s no context to these battles like the public had with much of what the Avengers had been involved in. People don’t know how to react to what they’re seeing. The X-men win but at a devastating cost . The public and government become wise to just how powerful and threatening mutants are to the point Xavier grieving over the loss of Logan and the danger he put his students in decides the best thing to do is to use Cerebro (developed in part with ‘borrowed’ Stark technology because who doesn’t love a little crossover) to wipe humanities mind of mutants entirely and any memory of the battle they just witnessed. 

He even goes as far as to allow humans to see Mutants who are visibly different than a typical human to see them as human (IE Shallow Hal logic). Maybe through the years there’s Mandela-effect types of rumors on internet boards of some massive battle in the 90’s and people almost remember but no one quite recalls. But the shockwaves of the multiverse and secret wars coming down the line causes humanity to remember and breaks Xavier’s psychic barrier that he built in humanity. People realize mutants were amongst them all along. 

I’m sure there are flaws in this logic but it was fun to think about over my morning coffee this morning.

My brother has turned into a full fledged Neo-Nazi over the past few years, literally idolizes Hitler and watches his speeches and stuff. So obviously that comes with antisemitism, racism/white nationalism, transphobia-  all the far-right talking points (why does that rabbit hole always lead to antisemitism?). This isn’t some edgy 15 year old boy, no, he’s a grown ass 30 year old 200lbs man. He has deep seated anger issues and childhood trauma (one time he punched the wall and started throwing shit in his room because he spilled his coffee or something). 

So when he’s ranting about wokeism or conspiracy theories or something, it’s legitimately scary, screaming at the top of his lungs foaming at the mouth type shit. I have grown to actually hate him and I have no respect for him as a person. He has no friends, nor a girlfriend, he just smokes weed and watches anti-woke slop. I don’t even need him to be liberal but even just a normal moderate conservative that isn’t addicted to rage bait? Is that too much to ask? These people are not compatible with a modern civilized society. 

I would totally just cut him off but we live together. So it’s like a 24/7 radio, he’s aaalllways baiting me into a political conversation or sending me boomer memes on social media. For context I’m quite a bit younger than him, I’m 24, and he’s always like “you’re gonna see when you get older!” As if I’m gonna turn 30 and turn into a racist. So condescending and narcissistic. 

To make matters worse I am also gay which has really strained our relationship. He knows I’m gay. His homophobia is never really directed at me, it’s always at the “gay agenda” or some invisible enemy, but I don’t know how he feels so comfortable saying F slurs etc around his gay brother. I basically just hide in the closet and never make any references to my sexuality, it’s like the elephant in the room, he has referred to it as “my secret” 🤮. 

Today was really the last straw.. there was a fire last night in the apartment building next to us, I sent him an article in the nypost about it. And - like clockwork - he started ranting about how it was started by Dominican immigrants cooking/a kitchen fire? I said “no, firefighters are saying it was a space heater” but then he just changed the goalposts. This bothered me so much. The total lack of empathy for people getting displaced by a fire. The rush to demonize people to fit your biased worldview. He feels justified because our president elect won an election using xenophobia as a platform. 

I’m just done. I’m way past my breaking point. I’ve been engaging with his shitty politics this entire time, doing my best to deradicalize him. But that’s not my responsibility anymore, and any opposition just makes him dig his heels deeper. The “casualties” in this subreddit name is so appropriate, because it really does feel like I lost my brother to a cult. If I never speak to him again I’ll be just fine with that. Honestly I have enough money saved to just move out but it does make more financial sense rn to have a roommate. So I guess this is the year of stonewalling him and completely ignoring everything he says. 🤷‍♂️ It does feel validating to know I’m not the only one being affected by this shit. I truly think the internet has radicalized people and done irreparable harm to humanity. thanks for reading if you made it this far, cheers and happy new year yall ",4,1736523287.0,QAnonCasualties,2,1.0,False
1hy71pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1hy71pw/thoughts_on_bankruptcy/,Thoughts on Bankruptcy?,"With the qualifier that I alone dug myself into this hole, currently sitting at about $35k in credit card debt with 25% APR on two cards (27k and 7k) and about $110K in student loans (80k gov 30k private from undergrad). Credit is anywhere from 580-680 depending on which bureau, so not getting any offers for balance transfers to lower my APR. The CC debt is relatively old - I've been making minimum payments on all cards/loans for about 5 years now. Currently an attorney (obtained most of the debt during undergrad/law school when loan funds ran out - do not recommend) but salary is $65k after taxes/healthcare/retirement and likely won't increase significantly for the next few years. There's a ""no other job"" provision in my employment contract, so side work/second job isn't really an option. Minimum payments on debts are around $2k a month. No kids, no car note, no mortgage (renting). Couple thousand bucks in an IRA but no savings. My phone is nearly 10 years old and paid off, car insurance is about $3k annually. Definitely still have some bad spending habits, but more in the ""daily coffee"" realm than ""brand new car every two years"" realm. Working on it!

I'm not quite in ""desperate"" mode yet, but I am relatively stuck due to my debt. I pay $2400 in rent (standard for my city) but it's difficult to switch housing with my current credit situation (every landlord wants 700 credit these days). Been in the same place for 4 years now but landlord also increases rent every year. My car is a 2016 Corolla with 175k miles, so I know car expenses will be coming sooner rather than later. I haven't missed any payments, no inquiries, no defaults etc, just stuck in ""minimum payment land"" for the foreseeable future. 

If the best way out is to slowly chip away then I'll just have to buckle down, but I am one moderately expensive emergency from being in real trouble. I studied bankruptcy in law school (the irony) so I know a fair amount about the process and all that it will entail, I just don't know if it's that serious yet. It feels disingenuous to use it as a resource when I'm *technically* above water. It's just been a lot of ""wait until the very last minute before they report to credit bureau"" type payments, and the stress is crazy. My concern is that most of my debt is non-dischargeable (student loans) and I have no assets other than my daily driver and my 401k. I also have no ""significant"" expenses, eg kids, mortgage, healthcare, so I don't know that I would even be eligible under the means test.

CHAPTER 1
It Happened Again
By: The Read-It Squad

Ordinary. Boring. Damn near invisible. This is what Madlor thinks of whenever he reflects on his life.

“What’s the point of it all?”

Madlor had taken to standing on his balcony in a pink silk bathrobe, wearing nothing but boxer briefs, nursing a hot glass (yes, glass) of coffee and chain-smoking Newport 100s. But today, even that ritual had lost its pull. He looked down at his mismatched slippers—one fuzzy blue, the other plain brown—and shook his head.

“Great,” he muttered, flinging his head back toward the heavens. His eyes closed, and for a moment, he let the familiar sting of tears creep in. He could still see Sciany (sigh-aw-knee) clearly—her sharp eyes, her crooked smirk, her laugh that used to echo through the streets of Mott.

The rain came fast, as if the skies wanted to save him from his tears. A drizzle became a downpour, washing over Tazón, drenching its ancient spires, cobblestone alleys, and tired citizens. Madlor stumbled back inside, grabbing his glass and cigarette box on the way.

Riiiiiiing, riiiiiing.

“Goddammit,” Madlor groaned, tripping over an old furry blanket thrown across the floor. He checked the door camera.

“Ron, what do you want, man?” he sighed, leaning against the wall, still tangled in the blanket.

“Bro, I thought you were dead. Open up!” Ron flashed his signature grin at the camera, his suit crisp and hair perfectly styled. “Come on, it’s been a month. Open sesame! Ooga booga!”

Ron looked every bit the opposite of Madlor—showered, sharp, and full of energy. He was like that even as kids, back when they ran through the tight alleys of Mott with Sciany, their trio inseparable.

Flashback: The Streets of Mott

Mott was a pocket of life nestled in the shadow of the imperial city’s gleaming towers. Its streets were narrow, its buildings weathered, but it thrummed with the energy of those who called it home. Kids played stickball on cobblestones, shopkeepers shouted their daily specials, and the scent of fresh bread and roasted meat lingered in the air.

Madlor, Ron, and Sciany grew up here, navigating Mott’s streets like it was their personal kingdom. Sciany was the fearless one, always leading the charge—whether it was sneaking into the forbidden orchards or haggling with the street vendors to snag free candy.

“You’re such a cheapskate,” Ron would tease, laughing as Sciany worked her magic.

Madlor, quieter but no less loyal, was the one they turned to when the plans fell apart. He had a way of fixing things—whether it was patching up a broken kite or talking their way out of trouble with a scowling shopkeeper.

The trio's bond had seemed unbreakable. But as they grew older, the cracks started to form. Sciany left Mott to chase dreams she never spoke of, and Ron climbed the social ladder, donning suits and mingling with the Tazón elite. Meanwhile, Madlor stayed behind, watching life pass him by.

Back in the present, Madlor unlocked the door, pulling it open with little enthusiasm.

“You really have to buzz me this early?” he grumbled, stepping aside to let Ron in.

“It’s 11:30. That’s not early, Mad,” Ron quipped, tossing his jacket on the couch. His eyes swept over the mess of takeout boxes, laundry piles, and half-empty coffee mugs. “Wow. You’re really… uh… thriving.”

Madlor rolled his eyes, slumping into a chair.

Ron sat across from him, his smile fading into something more serious. “Listen, man. It’s happening again.”

Madlor froze, the words cutting through his haze. “What do you mean?”

“You know exactly what I mean.”

And just like that, the memories of Sciany and the streets of Mott came rushing back…",1,1736523264.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False
1hy70ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hy70ul/he_ended_it_and_then_said_this_on_our_last_goodbye/,he ended it and then said this on our last goodbye ,"I dated this guy for four months, and we spent almost every day together. At the start, it felt like something out of a movie—like Bella and Edward vibes. We’d just lie in bed, staring at each other for hours, completely obsessed. He told me he’d never tried so hard with a girl before, and honestly, he was the most kind, loving, and generous person I’ve ever met. He’s still the most beautiful guy I’ve ever known.

We spent all of New Year’s Day together, but a few days later, everything fell apart. We had a fight because I kept asking to see him every day, and he said he couldn’t handle how demanding I was becoming. For the past month, he had already been pulling away—canceling plans and being more distant—but this time, he just snapped. I remember him saying, “Can’t I ever be alone?” That really hurt, but I guess I pushed too hard.

The last time I saw him, he tried to break things off over the phone, but I refused. I went to his house, sobbing, begging him not to leave, but his mind was made up. I asked if it was because of someone else, but he said no. I believe him because he used to post me on the only social platform he had, so I know there wasn’t anyone else. He told me he has a lot of issues to work through, needs time alone, and just wants to be single. When I left, we both cried, and it felt like my heart shattered. His last words to me were, “I’ll see you around.” It’s been six days of no contact since then.

The last thing he did was call me after I left his house to make sure I got home safe. I miss him so much, and I can’t stop thinking about everything I did wrong. I feel like I ruined it. I’ve been trying to move on—going out, keeping busy—but I secretly hope he notices somehow. He doesn’t have social media, so I have no way of knowing how he feels.

Something strange happened the other day, though. I was at my local coffee shop, which I’ve been going to for years, and I saw his sibling sitting there. It felt so random because I’ve never seen them there before. They were staring at me, and all I could think was, “Will they tell him I looked okay? That I was smiling?” I guess part of me hopes that’ll make him miss me or think about me.

I just don’t know what to do. I want him back so badly, but I don’t know if it’s possible. Did I ruin everything? Is there any chance he’ll come back?

(Plus new donor bonus money) Using the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:

[https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9](https://rewards.cslplasma.com/referral/referral-unique-code/eyJkb25vcklEIjoiMTMwMTkyMTciLCJjb2RlIjoiQVlMR1k1NERBRyJ9)

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. 

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. 



• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. 

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. 



• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

The old recipe was inoffensive and neutral tasting but this new version is thick, creamy and has a slightly sweet (and pretty vile imo) taste.  It now tastes much like I remember some of the big brand soya milks used to -  a bit odd.

I found it just about usable in coffee or on cereal (where the milk's flavour and sweetness is lost) but I tried using it on my overnight oats and it thickened up like custard :-/

Luckily I also have a Tesco nearby and can buy their cheapo Growers Harvest milk, which tastes just like the old Vemondo recipe.  Bit of a shame though, as Lidl's was previously my go to.",1,1736523026.0,veganuk,1,1.0,False

I am using bleached #4 filters, and a coarse grind, definitely coarser than any pictures I've seen of the correct grind. The water drains out fine without a filter. The filter is folded, rinsed and pressed down to the bottom. The footplate is installed. 

My last and final idea is to get a sifter for the fines and see if it's just because my grinder is making tok many fines. 

As an aside, I bought my inlaws the biggest version with the flat filters in 2023 and they haven't had issues- they are super low tech and never complained about overflows. If it was as hard for them to use as this one is for me, I would have heard about it.  

Any suggestions for what else I can try would be welcomed. I'm about to return it to Amazon if I can't get it figured out.

Hey Travel Trotters! 

If you’re dreaming of the ultimate travel experience that combines breathtaking landscapes, vibrant culture, and jaw-dropping history, then Peru should be at the top of your list. Having just explored my 36th country, Peru ended up being one of the most unforgettable adventures to date. Let me take you through ten must-do activities to add to your itinerary. 

### 🚂 Ride the Train to Machu Picchu
Imagine watching lush hills roll by as you journey towards one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The train to Machu Picchu offers unparalleled views. I suggest splurging on the panoramic car for a nature show like no other.

### 🏞️ Hike the Colca Canyon
Twice as deep as the Grand Canyon, the Colca Canyon is a trekker's paradise. Start at Arequipa, and don't forget to watch for the majestic Andean condors soaring past at Cruz del Condor. Tip: Hydrate and acclimate properly to the altitude!

### 💃 Dance at the Festival of the Sun (Inti Raymi)
Experience Peru's rich Incan heritage in Cusco during the vibrant festival of Inti Raymi in June. The city transforms into a living spectacle of music, traditional dances, and processions. Make sure you have your camera ready!

### 🍜 Dive into Peruvian Cuisine
Peru's culinary scene is incredible! Don’t miss trying ceviche and rocoto relleno. My top food market recommendation? Mercado San Pedro in Cusco — truly a haven for foodies.

### 🌈 Visit the Rainbow Mountain
With its striking striped hues, Vinicunca, or Rainbow Mountain, is perfect for the adventurous at heart. It's a challenging but utterly rewarding hike. Start early to beat the crowds and pack some cocoa leaves for altitude relief!

### 🚣 Kayak on Lake Titicaca
Explore the highest navigable lake in the world and visit the floating Uros Islands for a genuine, immersive experience. A kayak trip offers unparalleled tranquility amidst stunning views.

### 🚶 Discover Lima’s Artsy Barranco District
Barranco is Lima’s bohemian soul. Stroll through its charming streets, explore galleries, and grab a coffee in one of its quaint cafés. It’s a district that pulses with creativity and culture. 

### 🌿 Explore the Amazon Rainforest
Venture into the wild heart of the Amazon. From eco-lodges accessible via Puerto Maldonado, take guided night walks or boat trips to spot wildlife like caimans and capybaras.

### 🕍 Marvel at Kuélap Fortress
Often overshadowed by Machu Picchu, Kuélap is a hidden gem worth exploring. This ancient citadel in the Northern Andes offers captivating history with fewer crowds.

### 🏖️ Relax on the Beaches of Mancora
After all your adventuring, wind down on the sun-kissed shores of Mancora. This is a great spot for surfing or just soaking up the laid-back beach vibes.

Peru is a tapestry of exuberant culture, historical depth, and stunning landscapes. Whether you're seeking adventure, cultural immersion, or a culinary exploration, it truly has something magical for everyone. 🌟

1hy6wyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1hy6wyd/ginamit_ng_tito_ko_yung_toothbrush_ko/,Ginamit ng Tito ko yung toothbrush ko ,"Problem/goal: This matter is bigger that toothbrush. I'm really annoyed and don't know how to deal with it.

Context: My Tito and his wife broke up 3 months ago and been living with my fam since then.

- I have my own bathroom and let him use it. I provided him his own toiletries but yesterday I found my toothbrush with the cap removed so I suspect that he used it. What I did next is left a toothpaste to it and put the cap back. After I came home from work. I checked it and it had been used again.

- He plays loud music all the time. He is provided with his own room but prefer to stay at sala and it's in front of my room. Yes, as of now (11:24 PM)  while I am writing this he plays a really loud music.

- He uses my back up phone. It doesn't really matter to me when someone borrows my things. When he came to our house he didn't have anything and I provided him with what he needs but what annoys me is My dad already given him a phone but he pawned it to pay back the money he borrowed from my little sister to buy Illegal stuffs.

- He doesn't plan to leave. We're close to each other but I can't tolerate the things he is doing. He tells me that he will ""permanently"" live at our home. He always talk about his new ""girlfriend"" and said that he will live with her in our house.

- He treats me as his house boy, I am a working individual and he is jobless. I provide him allowance and money is not a matter for me but he is a fully healthy functioning person and still young. He always tells me to blend a coffee, cook, and even wash his clothes. 



Previous attempts:

Because of respect and he is my uncle I still didn't confront him about this things directly and ask my dad to do it. When my dad told him about the issues but he became overly dramatic and said that we should understand him cause he is still depressed due to their break up. Yes, I understand his pain because I've been in that situation but I feel like he's just using it as an excuse. 

I am frustrated  and don't really know what to do with him.

* Part of my stay is at the Hotel Madeleine, but I need to find (1) a place near the airport - Ibis, maybe? For my last night and someplace to cover the 2-3 days in between. 
* I know my absolute MUST SEE is Notre Dame. I'm ambivalent towards Disneyland Paris but could be convinced if it's something you \*have\* to do. I'm interested in the Eiffel Tower, Versailles and the Louvre, if only to say I did them, but I'm also open to other things.
* When I travel to new cities I love to see their local vintage shops, bookstores, coffee shops and anything else that makes the place unique.
* I LOVE to walk around, and that's what I'm looking forward to most, but I've heard it's not always totally safe as a single woman? (Others I know have said they felt perfectly fine.)
* Scammers - anything I need to be especially wary of that I wouldn't already be doing in a city? 
* Is it OK if I speak minimal French? I'll be practicing and I've heard it's more about the willingness to make the effort but I don't want to make an ass of myself, haha.
* Super weird question, but I have a lot of tattoos and brightly colored hair. Is this something that presents an issue there? I know in some places it's no big deal and in others you're advised to tone things down. 
* Finally - women who go to Paris alone - what do you think? What tips do you have in advance to make things as easy and seamless as possible so you're not standing around cluelessly in the middle of the street?

Thank you to everyone who can help, and I really will be using the next 3 months to prepare but I like to ask others about their experiences too. ",1,1736522628.0,ParisTravelGuide,2,0.67,False

Right now the entire morning routine falls on me. I wake up at 7, make us & pack her coffee and a water bottle. I start the kids (5 & 3) lunch boxes which is actually a snack box/ bento box style. I pack their water bottles, make sure all their stuff is in their backpacks. Make breakfast for them. Then I have to (95%) of the time pick them up out of bed and place them at the table for breakfast. Wife doesn’t want them eating school lunch so I try and make each one a real lunch but they don’t always eat it or want it so it’s not easy. Then we get dressed, pack up and drop off each kid at their different school. 

I’m not complaining I love taking care of my kids. But I do feel like I’m being treated like a robot. On Monday night my wife got upset with me because I wasn’t packing out 3 year old his own lunch from home and I tried to remind her that all of September I did and it always came home because he wants school lunch. Our daughter (5) has also been lining up for school lunch even though I pack her a separate lunch every day. Ravioli, a ham sandwich, grilled cheese, chicken nuggets ) etc. sometimes she eats it. Sometimes not. She literally goes to school with 2 lunch boxes and 2 water bottles because one is a snack box for the day with her water bottle and the other is for lunch time but she tends to forget her main water bottle so I pack her an extra with her lunch in a separate lunch box. 
All this and my wife gives me an attitude about their lunch and how she is “wasting hundreds of dollars on groceries weekly”. Which isn’t true. We both go grocery shopping. 

She is an over worked stressed out special ed teacher. So I try and do as much as I can but I’m struggling with being treated like a robot. Last night I picked up the kids, I straightened up the kitchen, made is a whole roasted chicken for dinner, cleaned up after every one, cleaned the kitchen, unpacked the kids backpacks. Wife didn’t get home until 6:30 and said she was “shopping around for stuff” but “I really neeeded alone time to decompress because I’m over stimulated at work and I can’t come home right away”. 

Can I wake up earlier and just do everything myself and completely ignore my own wants, needs and mental health? I suppose so, but that’s not how this is supposed to work. I need to ask her for help but I’ve done so in the past and it turns into a fight where it will eventually lead back to it being my fault. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can gently communicate with her? ",1,1736522534.0,Marriage,3,1.0,False

I am 24, so I use social media / listen to music a lot, and I find that I am getting overwhelming guilt around a few things: 

When using TikTok or other social media, my feed has a lot of Christian and praying videos, which I love. Most of the time I watch them, if I feel like it is a video that will resonate with me. But lately I’ve been feeling like I’m not allowed to skip them and just watch some entertainment that I usually enjoy. 

It almost feels as if I’m saying I don’t have time for god, when in reality I do, It’s just I also enjoy my other videos.

Same for music, I have a “Christian coffee house” play list which I enjoy when I feel like I need to be closer to God, but lately I’ve been feeling guilty for listening to my own music.

I’m sorry if this sounds silly to some people, but it’s a real issue for me, so any advice or encouragement would be welcomed.

1hy6q6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1hy6q6o/i_finally_found_something_that_works_please_read/,I FINALLY FOUND SOMETHING THAT WORKS. PLEASE READ.,"Hi all I'm a dude, 21, undiagnosed but will be visiting a psychiatrist soon for ADHD evaluation. Before the big event, I want to say that I have tried everything to be able to function normally. Took care of my diet, never skip 3 meals a day, more veggies and fruits, my sleep is on point 7.5-9 hours, lifestyle wise I am active and I lift weights 4-5 times a week. Nothing seems to work and I constantly felt empty and underestimulated. Willpower is never enough to get me going through the day, I always had to use toxic masculinity (cursing and physical abuse while disregarding all of my own efforts to survive) in order to motivate myself to get things done (be it work or study or anything else). 

Realising that nothing seems to be working, I started my journey on nootropic/brain supplements. At first, it was basic stuff like fish oil and vitamin c & b. Unfortunately, it couldn't feel any benefit for my own cognitive function. So I hopped on ""complex"" stuff that focus on enhancing cognition. Examples are Magnesium Threonate (and other forms of magnesium), Gingko Biloba, Lion's Mane and Pseudoephedrine (Prescription drug used for cold, fun fact it is banned in some countries because it can be an ingredient to produce methamphetamine).
Yes obviously I did see positive results from them but also negatives (side effects). They were either giving me anxiety attacks or ruining my sleep patterns. Lion's mane was one of them.  It made me think sharper and have better memory but it was eating my sleep away (feeling awake the whole night behind my eyelids) to the point I turned manic and very depressed. 

Besides all of that, there are also experiments that I tried to achieve wakefulness and alertness. Taking ice cold showers, eat super hot spicy foods, consuming big doses up caffeine (500mg was my worst I couldn't sleep the whole night). No suprise, they're not viable and the benefit I attain were not long lasting. Anyway, I don't sound like a normal person right? Those were my desperate attempts to find a cure for this unbearable lethargy that was making me feel like a living dead. 

It was all trial and error, repeated over and over again for more than a year. Feeling hopeless, I finally mustered the courage to get a referral from a GP to a mental institute to get assessed for ADHD. Guess what? My appointment is 3 MONTHS. At that point, I felt like have tried everything already. Nothing but to feel miserable untill the day comes.

However, there was still one bottle of creatine sitting in my cabinet. And I recalled that it made me have kidney pain. But that was because I didn't keep myself hydrated as many have advised me while being on it. So I gave it another chance. 3 Litres of distilled water was my main goal everyday. Researchers say it will take up to 4 weeks to see benefits from creatine, but the studies were meant for performance gains (exercise). But for nootropic gains, it only took a few days or less than a week. My thoughts were clearer, I felt more more smarter so to say, not that I can suddenly do calculus or enroll in law school, but I was curious again about my surroundings and felt more in the present. I experienced lesser anxiety as well. Unlike coffee, creatine isn't a stimulant. So the benefits for cognitive function lasted throughout the day. Bear in mind that I still lift weights during this experiment, and when I was off for a month due to sickness, the effect of creatine didn't work as much. I believe exercise (lifting heavy weights particularly) does play a big part to reap the benefits of creatine.

To top it off, caffeine does wonders to amplify the effectiveness of creatine. I took it in a form of an energy drink (Monster 106.5mg). It does have panax ginseng which may improve cognitive abilities but I'm not so sure if it does much for me. More importantly I only take it as a pre workout because I hate the jitter feeling and anxiety that caffeine gives me. Lifting heavy to failure is an excellent way of elimination this side effect. 

From combining creatine, heavy lifting and caffeine. You WILL feel alive, for a while at least. This discovery was the game changer for me this year. I look forward to every gym session because the aftermath is worth every energy and effort I expend.
You need to try this experiment especially if you have been feeling dead inside for a long time. If the option for psychiatric medication is not available for you, this is the alternative you should go for. 
You will not regret it.

One last tip, do prepare a bottle of melatonin if case you deal with trouble sleeping occasionally due to the intake of caffeine. I wish you all the best ❤️",3,1736522435.0,Biohackers,1,1.0,False

1hy6p8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW/comments/1hy6p8r/how_do_you_get_over_a_relationship_which_was/,How do you get over a relationship which was unhealthy but also so good? What's a normal wlw relationship like? ,"Hi all,

I just need some perspective. Recently went through my first wlw breakup of several years and it’s left me reeling. I’m struggling to process the fallout and emotions. We're 25 and 26 for context- not teenagers. Grown adults. 

We met in Canada whilst I was there as a temporary resident. Now here permanently. I had some pretty severe homesickness about a year or so into the relationship and almost moved home. I 100% understand this made her insecure (just adding for context), but we worked through it. For the years after that, I was happy. A few weeks ago, this home sickness popped up again. But there was also something deeper- I think there were some niggling things that I had ignored for so long, and they then actually became more of an issue than my homesickness. I’ll try and keep it brief, but amongst other issues:

* Issues with my family (when my family visited and I went out with them, she would stop texting me/ignore me, make passive aggressive comments about how much time I was spending with them, would text me “I’m bored/when are you going to be home”, get mad and then ignore me because I wasn’t spending as much time with her- when they only visited for a week at a time, months apart.)
* We had a home emergency once on a day my family and I had a day trip planned on their vacation to see me- I asked her to handle it, but she went to work, so I ended up coordinating it all from my phone for her to deal with when she got back from work. It was nothing major, but she ended up sending me a bunch of pretty horrible text messages. She only apologized when I told her very firmly that that is NOT how you treat someone you love. Had it been the other way around, I would have handled the emergency without question so she could spend valuable time with her family.
* I was late for an event once when my brother was visiting for a week as I had to come from work, go pick up my brother and then get to the other side of the city. This meant we didn’t have the best seats at the event because you can’t save them and she got really mad at me- was being cold to me throughout the event, wouldn’t touch me, kept saying things like I didn’t treat her well and didn’t do enough for her.
* Always wanted me to be available- By the end of this, I felt nervous when I missed her phone calls. I missed her call once and then she just started sending me one word messages and ignored me all night to make a point (I was out with a friend.)
* Had issues with my work (saying she came second and got annoyed I couldn't leave on time, got annoyed when my internship got stressful and it impacted our routine a bit)
* I started buying gifts to apologize for things that looking back, really were *not* my fault. She’d get in a mood and I’d buy her coffee. Or little gifts. 
* Started getting a bit critical- saying I didn’t put enough effort into things, saying she felt like my mother, etc. I admit I can be a bit scatty, but I was also studying and working full time and had a lot of pressure on me.
* The relationship had started feeling off in terms of financial equality- see above re gifts. But also, I’d buy her stuff from the shops (little things but it adds up) but she’d always ask for my card if I asked her to get me something. Not an issue, but it wasn’t equal. She earned more than me.
* Also had issues every time I go home- I felt I had to call every single day, if I didn’t answer or couldn’t tall she’d get a bit annoyed or just be like “fine, bye” and hung up very obviously annoyed.
* Other issues: would make comments about the gifts I got her- they had to be perfect. One year she gave me a list and I got her an item off the list and got her another gift she DID like, but a few weeks later it was thrown back in my face because I ""barely used the list."" I got her a sculpture from an artist she liked (limited replica) and it cost a lot but then she said just because she likes the artist, it doesn't mean she likes that sculpture and then she made me feel like I had barely put any thought into it at all. I understand bringing genuine concerns with your partner, but the way it was framed and such a big deal just made me feel like crap. 

There’s more but I don’t need to go into that as I think the above paints enough of a picture. I broke up with her a few weeks ago. She was adamant we should try couples therapy because we owe it to our relationship, I said she was the love of my life, etc. She also said she “didn’t know because I didn’t tell her.” But that was never my job, right? I did try to talk to her about some of the issues with my family- one time she asked me to hang out with her when my family were visiting and I said no because I’d have to cut my day trip short. She turned off her location and then started ignoring me, barely replying, all night, to the point I was worried. (And I bought her a gift because I felt bad!) I confronted her about this and she said she was “busy.” The only time she admitted to having an issue was after we broke up, and to her credit, she did see a therapist. But it was too late for me.  

I’m only 26. I don’t want to try couple’s therapy at this age. Plus, she says it is all down to insecurity because she was scared I’d want to move back home. But then how does this explain the issues with my work and getting critical? You can’t put everything down to the feeling insecure about my homesickness. And even if it was, that still doesn’t make it a healthy reaction. This has been going on for literal years.

I’ve always responded to her criticisms of me, and tried to grow as a person. But I didn’t realize how deeply ingrained these issues were. It’s thrown my head, because we had such amazing moments and closeness and I’ve lost my best friend. But I know it isn’t right to be treated like that. I keep swinging between thinking we should have tried to make it work and that actually, these issues are quite deep, and that she needs a lot of time and help, and is probably better off doing that single. I’m actually about to start my own therapy, because I’m struggling with the dynamic.

If a man had behaved like this, I’d never have excused it so much. I’m just struggling with the dynamic, and the behaviour tied up with such a bond. When we broke up, she said “all couples have issues,” which also felt like it was minimizing the scenario. Her opinion seemed to be that I was throwing away our years together and not as committed to her.

Has anyone experienced something like this? What is a ‘regular’ relationship with a woman like? I think I ignored the behaviour for so long because I didn't want to lose her. But eventually, it got to the point where I realized I do deserve better and that the longer it carried on, the more I was losing myself. 

I just need hope for the future. I feel burned and raw and pretty hurt. I know a relationship shouldn't be so up and down all over the place. I shouldn't be sat with my family anxious and on edge because my girlfriend is being funny with me. I shouldn't feel like I lost myself.

1hy6nxo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hy6nxo,I’m almost a year in and I’m getting so self conscious and antsy.,"I’ve come a long way from having an open/under bite, but I feel like my teeth aren’t as white as they could be (gotta cut back on the coffee) and I can’t use any whitening products until I’m done with treatment. 

I’ve noticed great improvement with my bite closing, and the underbite being gone, and even my midline has improved but maybe I’m overthinking myself into feeling like I’ve hit a wall. 

My teeth are also flaring in the top and I was quoted at 18-24 or even 30 months! I know I have a lot of time but I’ll be at my 1 year mark in March 2025.

I’m wondering what more work my orthodontist wants to do at this point.

She loves Japan, plushees, and unique artisan things (pottery, jewelry, etc.)

I have an upcoming week off from work and would appreciate learning some of your favorite “must-go” places and experiences throughout the city, including any events (shows, lessons, etc), restaurants, coffee shops, local stores, etc. I already plan to see a broadway show and visit museums and touristy spots I haven’t had a chance to see yet. Also, I’ll be solo and happy to visit any borough/neighborhood. Thank you in advance!!

What really disturbs me most (besides anxiety, some of the ocd loops and though stickiness) is how it impacts my physical state. I feel weak, tired and exhausted, already waking up, taking first steps out of bed, sleep lots etc. I thought it be something else (did allergy tests, blood tests, followed ideas for causes) but the result were all negative. How do you deal with this? I drink coffee, drink energy drinks and sorts and eat feel good food. But it still sucks because I don’t want to work out etc because I feel even weaker afterwards. It’s the mean reason SSRIS are something very valid for me. Anyone can maybe enlighten me, tried some surprisingly effective stuff? Thank you and may OCD be with you🖤",3,1736521988.0,OCD,0,1.0,False

I'm probing for ideas to keep my chemicals balance well. 

What are some good options for lightweight and effective powder mixes for body maintenance?

I'm toying with the idea of making my own mix of combining BCAAs and Super Greens. Potentionally adding electrolytes to top off any missing components. 

I plan to get drop shipments once a month from my wife so I can maintain a constant supply of my preferred items. Things I know I'll have a hard time finding, like calmoseptine packets or my favorite chapstick or toothpaste. 

Current practice for breakfast, I like mixing a Cafe Bustelo Vanilla K-cup (which is actually just instant coffee so I pop the top and dump into my cup) with carnation instant breakfast powder and water. I really like this practice. 

I'm a strong believer that malnutrition is a HUGE factor in injuries and mental health issues on the trail. People eating ramen and whatever they can find at stores could lead to a chemical imbalance that might contribute to a symptom that is self diagnosed incorrectly. ""I'm getting headaches so it must be allergies or sinuses"" when maybe it's just their sodium levels are low and mild dehydration started. Usually sodium is the easiest electrolyte to get since a lot of junk like ramen has plenty of sodium. What about calcium? Spiral fractures from slips after 3-4 months of very low calcium and high impact hiking on the legs. These are my shower thoughts. 

Since I've started taking super greens, I've really felt better overall. My diet has been crap and my health dropped over the past 6 years at a toxic desk job. Speaking of toxic, I am very good at reading my own urine. Urine can speak a lot about your health. When I was body building back in the day, I learned that foamy pee was excess protein from my powders being expelled. So I started splitting them up. Half a scoop twice spread apart instead of all at once. Little stuff like that helped me so much when I was very athletic. 

When I was skateboarding professionally, I used to make my own ""power bars"". I'm not a stranger to DIY health solutions.

Any thoughts on a DIY powder? Or even bringing multiple types of powders and take off one at a type? ",0,1736521945.0,Ultramarathon,2,0.33,False

Guess that’s why I’m here now. But I honestly don’t have any of the hate you guys have for boomers. And I’ve been pondering why that is. 

My hypothesis is that I was raised by poor working class boomers and most people here are mad a middle class or above boomers. 

We very much lived the life style that most people here are pissed that boomers suggest. Don’t eat out, no coffee, etc. we legit grew our own food and went out to eat once a year. So when a boomer suggests it, I usually just think they’re saying to do that because that was their experience. My mother has told me stories about walking 10 blocks to the diner to ask for a bowl of hot water then pouring ketchup into it to make “tomato soup” because she was out of money for the week and that was the only thing she would be able to eat until payday. Idk.

I live in the suburbs of salt lake city Utah in a house that’s pretty old but for some reason when I woke up that day my house was in a field.

A wheat field that seemed to stretch endlessly to the horizon. I couldn’t tell if I was dreaming or not so I just got in bed and closed my eyes. The next thing I knew my house was back where it was supposed to be.

Though that wasn’t the last time this happened. About two days later things started to feel off. Everything felt like a dream, as if nothing was real and it was all in my head. But no matter what I did I couldn’t get rid of the feeling.

Yesterday I noticed that all the plants outside were gone. I looked at doorbell camera footage suspecting they were stolen but from what I saw the plants were never there to begin with. I texted my wife who planted said plants but she claimed she has never brought a plant in or around the house since we moved in.

I called my dad asking him about the plants but he said the same thing. I think im starting to go crazy or something because I could have sworn there was two pots in front of the house with some orange and red flowers and a tree out front. In fact now it seemed that my house was the only one without a tree on the property.

Anyways I have decided to write things down and post them online or where ever I put this for now this Is just a note to myself written on a word document.

I got out of bed this morning and had a donut and coffee for breakfast. My wife leaves for her work earlier than me. It makes the mornings peaceful and quiet. But sometimes, especially times like this it makes me feel quite lonely. When I walked out the front door I looked across the street to see my neighbors didn’t have and trees or bushes. As I turned my head and looked down the street I realized no one had any bushes or trees. Everyone gardens were empty patches of dirt bricks laid in circles around nothing.

A feeling of uneasiness filled me but I decided to worry because it was probably just a dream. I debated whether or not I should still go to work or take the day off. As I stood on my front porch it hit me, if I was dreaming I could wake myself up or at least become lucid. I did everything I could but nothing seemed to work. I walked inside and went to lay down for a bit when I hit my hip on the counter “*FUCK”* I shouted out loud.

The sharp agonizing pain or bumping into a marble corner was indescribable it hurt a million times worse than it should have. I looked at my hip and noticed I was bleeding. It wasn’t bad just a small cut but it still hurt enough for me to call it quits for the day.

When I pulled out my phone to call in sick I couldn’t find my bosses contact. And I couldn’t remember his number, and for some strange reason I couldn’t remember his name or hers i completely forgot what they looked like what they sounded like. And then I couldn’t remember where I worked.

I sat down trying to think but I started to question if I even had a job. Nothing felt real and I had no idea what was happening.

I think I just need to get some sleep.

I woke up to loud bang.

I jumped out of bed dazed and confused I was sweating and I couldn’t remember what I was doing asleep so late until I saw my laptop open beside me. I heard footsteps that crept closer to the door. “WHO ARE YOU” I shouted the bedroom door swung open and I saw my wife. “Your home? This early?” I asked “its seven, I’m late.” “oh shit its seven but that doesn’t make any sense. I feel like just two minutes ago I was going to go to work but then some weird stuff happened, and speaking of that I need to tell yo…” “work? You got a job?”

“what do you mean you got a job?”

“you said you were going to work why didn’t you tell me that you got a job?”

“What are you saying I’ve had this job for ten years I- I don’t know what else to say.”

“Are you okay?”

“well no there’s a bunch of weird stuff happening and I’m losing my mind about it”

“like the plants you wont shut up about”

“well yeah but the neighbors don’t have any plants didn’t you see?”

“honey you need to get some rest, I don’t know what has gotten into you.”

“what?”

My wife never called me honey before

“its just you need to sleep”

“I’ve been sleeping. ”

“well okay then. I need to run to the store and buy some dogfood.”

“What? For who?”

“for us silly.”

Her voice sounded strange. Monotone and lacking any emotion at all

“while I’m gone you should really go sleep”

“No, What do you mean for us?”

“for our dog its hungry”

“We don’t have a dog”

She looked at me with a blank stare and said

“I don’t know what your talking about he’s right outside.”

I turned around and looked out the back door and saw a small sheep dog running around on a yard full of dirt I couldn’t remember if there was grass in the backyard and then I started to remember having a dog.

I looked back at my wife and I couldn’t seem to fully recognize her. Her face felt off. I could recognize her voice even the strange way she was talking to me but her face I just couldn’t remember even when looking directly at her. I made myself dinner and went to my bed but my wife never came to join. I shouted her name a few times until I forgot what her name was. It was like I had been shouting gibberish I got out of bed and felt lost.

I walked around the dark house that now felt like I different world and couldn’t find my wife but then it hit me a realization, a fear. I was alone. And I never had a wife. I keep reading this over and over and over again but I cant remember anything I didn’t type in the last five minuets.

I’m losing my mind.

I have decided to just go to sleep and figure things out in the morning.

I woke up around 3 ish in the morning I was cold so I got up to turn on the heater but when I looked outside I saw a forest I ran to every window in the house to be met with the same sight. A pitch black forest, one of those it eats you alive forests. I couldn’t believe what my eyes were seeing I decided to go back to sleep and pray that this was just some weird dream but as I was getting in bed I saw a not on my nightstand it read “*don’t talk to them, don’t listen to them, don't look at them and never leave the house.”*Last week I noticed something strange, when I woke up from an abnormally long sleep my house wasn’t where it was supposed to be.

I wake up and leave the snoring gremlins to their sleep.
“Morning Chompy.”

I make my way to the guest room where Aurora is still recovering. Granny said she would take care of her and it’s been less than twenty four hours so I should show some patience. I walk in and see a very wake and very naked Aurora putting on a thong. 
“Oh my god. You’re awake.”

Aurora spins around.
“I am. Got a visit from Granny.”

I walk into the room.
“What happened in Springville?”

Aurora explains as she puts on a corset.
“I was touched by Gia. A rare honor.”

“Yes, yes. I was there. There’s more to this story.” I say.

“The planet spoke to me. It told me how to fix the lines. When I tapped into them, that’s when it happened.”

“And what happened?” I ask.

“I became connected to the whole ley line system across the whole world. I was everywhere at once.”

“You became overwhelmed.”

“That’s the simplistic answer, yes.”

“I’m so glad you’re ok. Granny told me she was going to see you.”

Aurora gives a slight smile.
“She came to me in a dream. She helped me very much.”

“Are you ok? Granny said you’ve done things above your skill set. Like absorbing Luna spheres. Are you being reckless?”

“That was a bit above my pay grade. I absorbed the one but a second one is out of the question. Anything I do is a calculated risk. How else am I going to get stronger?”

“Ok. Don’t push the envelope too hard. You’re no good to anyone dead. Oh! By the way, while you were out. I had Scorn participate in a gargoyle exercise. He was awesome. Just thought you should know.”

Aurora whistles and Scorn lands on her shoulder, she starts scratching under his chin.
“I’m very proud of you. When we aren’t together, you represent me. I’m very pleased.”

Scorn nuzzles her neck.

“Well. Ok. Now that you’re up on your feet. I’ll open the vault. That is if you’re up for it.” I say.

“I’m very up to it. Do we have anything today?”

I run my hand through my hair.
“We got Jack shit today. Holden is doing MC stuff. Maddy is putting together her transition team. You’re cracking open the books. These last few days have been stressful so I’m taking a hike. To decompress a little bit.”

“You want me to come with?” Aurora asks as she puts on some leather pants.

“Nah. I’m just going on a hike. I’m not looking for trouble. Besides, I’m sure you’re eager to get back to your studies.”

“If you change your mind.”

“I’ll let you know.”

“One question before you leave.” Aurora says.

“Sure.”

“How did I get here?” She asks.

“Well. Holden carried you to the car and then up here. I undressed you after he was gone.”

Aurora lowers her head as she smiles.
“He could’ve taken a peek.”

That remark catches me off balance for a second.
“Yeah…well….talk you ya later.”

I walk out of the room. I don’t know how to handle the sexual tension between Aurora and Holden. The bickering, the glances…you know what? I don’t care. I got enough on my plate. They’ll figure it out…or not. Since I’m taking a hike today, I just take a whore bath and throw on some clothes, I gently shake Snowflake.
“Hey, dude.”

Snowflake opens his eyes.

“I’m taking a hike. Want to come with me?”

Snowflake chatters.

“Are you not feeling well or something?”

Snowflake chatters.

“Ok. If you’re sure.”

I kiss him on the forehead and he closes his eyes. I go to the basement and open the vault. Then I head to the kitchen and make an iced coffee. I go out to the patio and light a blunt. As I exhale, I look up.
“Maybe tonight we can hang out.” I say to a slumbering Thilbault.

I take a sip of my coffee and enjoy the sun shining on me. As I sit there, I think. You know…it’s been a hot minute since I’ve been on a picnic. So that’s what I’m doing today. A hike and picnic. I take a hit and smile. Today is going to be perfect. I finish my breakfast of champions and head inside. I still have a couple of hours to kill so I throw my hatchet for awhile as I listen to my mom’s iPod. Her collection of music is exquisite. Especially the nineties alt rock. So I’m not just practicing, I’m also having a bit of a dance party. When it gets to be around noon, I hop in Jolene and leave for the quarry. Along the way, I pick up so,e fried chicken. Eventually I make it and park. I grab my shit and head towards one of those open air shelters. I find one and sit down. I take a bite of my chicken and sip my pop.

This.

This was a good idea.

I enjoy my lunch as I enjoy the nature around me. This is what it’s all about. I finish my lunch and throw everything away. I grab my water bottle and hit the trails. Since it’s very early fall, the breeze keeps things from getting too warm. The weather is perfect right now. As I walk, the woods become quiet. Too quiet. The hairs in my arms stand up. What the fuck? I don’t need this. The birds have stopped singing and the insects have become quiet. As I walk, I put a hand on my hatchet. I stop walking and look around.
“Who’s there?” I ask rather loudly.

Out of the bushes walks…Supervillian.

“Illyria. We meet again.” He says.

“Supervillian. You need help.”

He starts pacing.
“From who? Who’s strong enough to help me? Perhaps you.”

“Yes. I’ll take you to the hospital. Something is very wrong.”

He chuckles.
“Wrong indeed. I’m so tired of the unwashed masses attacking my kingdom. They will pay.”

“Who? Who is coming at you and what kingdom?” I ask.

He widens his eyes.
“The FBI, the CIA, other shadow government agencies. The military. All have tried to hurt you but that right is reserved for me.”

“I doubt that. I had a shadow government agent tell me that the government has washed its hands of this place.”

“Not at all. During these battles I’ve watched. In the quiet times I’ve upgraded.” He says as he lifts an arm. It looks like metal has been grafted onto it.

“No. Supervillian. That’s self harm.” I say.

“No. It’s self improvement.”

He walks towards me but I take a step back.
“Where are you going? There will be no place to go in the end when it’s just you and me.”

“What do you mean?” I ask.

Supervillian raise his arms to the sky.
“You hero’s are all the same. Naive, hot. Y’all are like supermodels with he brains of golden retrievers.”

“Wait. Hold on. I’m confused.”

“Well of course you are. Typical hero bullshit.”

“You are kinda fucking me up. You make these comments about world destruction and then make little comments about me.” I say.

“It’s simple really.” Supervillian says as he takes a step towards me as I take a step back. “You are the only one I consider equal. When I destroy the world. It will be only you and I. We will be like Adam and Eve part two.”

“That doesn’t make sense. If I’m a hero I would never be ok with the destruction of the world.”

“It’s you that’s not thinking this through to its natural conclusion. You hate it when bad things happen to good people, yes?”

“Yeah. Most people do.” I answer.

“You hate evil politicians and corporations that go out of their way to hold down decent people for their gain.” 

“Well. Yeah, that sucks.”

Supervillian just smiles.
“The only reason I’m a supervillian is because I believe the ends justify the means. In fact there are no means that are too violent or underhanded for the ends.”

“In this case, what are the ends?”

Supervillian spreads his arms.
“Why the perfect peace. There will be no war, no greed, no societal ills if nobody is here.”

“That’s a dark vision. There is a lot of humanity that does good.” I say.

“Oh really? Too weak to fight corruption. Making excuses like I have a family. I can’t get caught up in all of that. It doesn’t affect me, so why should I care? Tell me…what good has humanity ever produced? Besides some pretty pictures and statues and maybe a couple of catchy songs? Hum?”

“I mean…you left out we make some amazing dishes that are mind blowing.”

“Yes. Amazing food but most people starve.”

“There are laws and things that protect us and help us live amazing lives.”

“Laws created by the corrupted for their gain and can be taken away at a snap of the fingers.” He says.

Supervillian has me on my heels. I just can’t find a logic that will work in him but I keep trying.

“What of the orphan children or the children that get the shit beat of them? I suppose all they need is some nice Christmas dinners and that will fix them right up.” Supervillian says.

“Look. Anyone can nit pick any little fact to prove their point. That doesn’t change the fact that most of humanity is good.”

Supervillian crosses his arms.
“This is where we disagree. You aren’t willing to go far enough for the greater good and I am. I suppose out of the two of us, I’m actually the superhero. You are content to let evil run roughshod of everything. I will change your mind. In the end, I will win.”

“Look, dude…”

I’m cut off my the should have a gunshot and blood exploding onto my face. I look in horror as there is a hole where Supervillian’s right eye used to be. Supervillian sways back and forth for a moment.
“Ain’t that a bitch. How rude.”

Then he collapses and I run to him. In that moment many soldiers in paramilitary gear come out of the bushes and surround us.
“Target down.”

“What the fuck is going on? You killed him!” I scream.

One of them grabs my arm.
“You don’t need to worry about him anymore. He’s no longer a threat. Our scientists want to see you.”

I yank my arm away.
“Get the fuck off of me.”

“Augmented strength confirmed. Pull out the big guns.” He says.

They swarm me and hit me with pepper spray and stun guns. I hit the ground and through blurred vision I watch as Supervillian crawls away while the soldiers were distracted by me.

“Or you going to cooperate or end up like your friend?” One of the soldiers asks,

“Fuck you!” I scream back.

“You know. Every once in a while a test subject gets a little uppity.” One of them says.

I start laughing.

“What do we have here? Seems this one is into this kinda shit.”

“You took your eye off the prize?” I mange to get out.

They all look behind.

“Where is the other fucking target?”

They stop tasing me.
“Where did he go?” Asks one of them.

I start laughing uncontrollably and one of the soldiers hits me with the butt of his rifle.
“Shut up.”

The leader yells.
“Find him. I don’t know how’s he still alive but find him.”

Before they can start their search, there is a honking of a car horn. Not a beep but a long, never ending honk. I look in the direction of the sound and it’s a hummer on fire moving through the trees towards us. There is a man with a sniper rifle tied to the hood. It bounces of a tree here and there and hits a solider furthest from me and crashes head first into a large tree.
“Shit. The sniper has been taken out. Fire!” The leader yells.

They fire their guns at the hummer. Within seconds it is full of holes. They stop firing and the leader yells.
“Search the hummer.”

A soldier approaches the bullet hole filled hummer cautiously. When he gets to the drivers side door. Supervillian pops up and screams.
“Supervillian!”

He then shoves a grenade into the soldiers mouth and kicks open the door. The soldier stumbles back a couple of steps and explodes. At least now I’m not the only one covered in blood and gore. Supervillian hops out of the hummer and starts tossing grenades around all willy nilly. I take this as a good time to run. As I do, shit starts exploding all around me.

“Kill him!” The leader shouts.

I get a safe distance away and hide behind a tree. Supervillian is gone as well as half of the soldiers. There is only fire and smoke left.
“Get out here you lunatic.” The leader screams.

“Sure!” Supervillian yells back somewhere from the trees. 

There is gunfire coming from the woods and one of the soldiers falls. Supervillian runs out of the woods and says.
“Oops. My bad. I would recruit you I to my army but it seems you’re fragile and easily die.”

He runs back into the woods.

“I want his head!” The leader yells.

The remaining soldiers take off and start looking for him. It seems at this point they have forgotten about me. Minutes pass and a soldier loops back around to the still on fire hummer. Unbeknownst to him, Supervillian sneaks up from behind in a cartoon manner. High stepping, arms out and hands folded down. Supervillian also has a huge smile and eyes way open. When he gets close enough, he snaps the soldiers neck from behind. Once the soldier falls, Supervillian drops to his knees. From this angle I can’t see what’s going on. When he’s done with whatever he is doing, Supervillian turns and looks at me with a finger to his lips. I have no idea how he knows where I’m at. Supervillian then grabs the soldier’s gun and fires it into the air and then he takes off running.

What did he do?

There’s no way I’m going to look and find out. I’m sure I’m about to find out soon enough anyway. All of the remains soldiers come back except for the leader.
“What the fuck?” One of them asks.

“It’s his fault. He broke protocol.” Says another.

“Let me check for a pulse just in case.” Says a soldier.

The second he bends down and touches the body it explodes killing all of them. I slam my hands on my ears to protect them. This explosion was a step too far, it was too big and I was too close and slow. My ears are now ringing and I have a headache. Just like that, it’s down to Supervillian and the leader.. minutes and minutes pass and the leader walks to the edge of the destroyed area. He pulls up a walkie talkie and says.
“Both targets got away. Team neutralized. Request pickup.”

“Roger. Bird in the way.”

Supervillian pops up behind him and stabs him in the lower back. He falls to his knees but Supervillian grabs his collar and keeps him from falling over. Supervillian then grabs the leader’s gun and tosses it.
“Won’t be needing that.”

He then tosses the leader into the area and flips him in his back. Supervillian then sits on his chest and drags the bloody knife down his cheek.
“I’ve taken away your ability to walk. Keep fucking with me and I’ll take more.”

“Fuck you, asshole. You will pay.”

Supervillian smacks him in the face hard.
“This is wild. You shot me in the head before I took you all out and still shit talking. Have some common sense to know you are far lower in the predatory ladder than I.”

“What do you want? We won’t stop hinting you.”

“You can and will. The only reason I left you alive is too send a message. Ready?”

The leader says nothing. Supervillian slowly raises his hand to strike him again.
“Ok. Fine. What is the message?”

“Your little bio company will stop doing research in this state. You will leave me and Illyria alone.”

“Who’s Illyria?” Asks the leader.

Supervillian punches him hard in the face.
“Do not insult my intelligence again. You know good and goddamn well who Illyria is. You will stop or I will put my plans for world domination on hold and focus on your company. I do mean total destruction. Every lab, every employee. Plus I will take your trade scents and release them in the internet. Understand?”

“Yes but I don’t make those decisions.”

Supervillian leans down closer to him.
“It will be your job to convince those above you. This is your first, last and final warning.”

Supervillian gets up and walks to me. Before I can do anything, he grabs my face and kisses me passionately.
“Are you ok?” He asks.

“I’m fine. What the hell are you going to do now? How are you still alive?”

Supervillian’s one remaking eye dances with madness.
“I’m not dead because I’m Supervillian. No mortal man can kill me. As for what’s next, I will go to my lair and plot my next move.”

“Where’s your lair?” I ask.

Supervillian waves a finger in front of of my face.
“Nah, nah, nah. You haven’t earned the right to know. Until we meet again, Illyria.”

With that he runs into the woods. I just stand there in stunned silence.

“Like I said, by the grace of dad go I.”

I turn around and see Satan and my skin crawls. My day couldn’t be any worse.
“He truly needs help.”

Satan raise an eyebrow.
“He should be dead by now.”

“Excuse me?” I ask.

“We have entered uncharted waters. To my knowledge no one has survived this long after contact with a chaos elemental. Now you see how dangerous they are. Imagine…just imagine someone like me getting hit with one. I shudder to think.”

“What will happen to him if he dies?”

“Free of its mortal prison. The chaos elemental will roam again. This is the way it’s been since the beginning.” Satan answers.

“The beginning of what?”

“Everything.”

“I should go.” I say. I desperately want to get away right now.

“Ok then. Ta ta.”

As I start to walk away I hear Satan talk to the leader.

This is my little guy Obi wan Kenobi… he’s a Mini Labradoodle. And he’s about 5 months old!

I’m just wondering if anyone has fur baby similar to his coat/hair. We brush him out everyday, usually in the morning while we drink our coffee ☕️… but I noticed he has this distinct smell. It’s not necessarily a bad odour, but it’s not the best lol.
I must sound like a maniac but last night I was sniffing him wondering where the heck the smell is coming from. It’s not from his skin, but definitely his fur. It’s been like this since we got him at 10 weeks.

Sometimes it smells like pee…? But not really as we all know dog pee has a distinct smell. But every close to it. It would make sense if maybe he got pee on him etc. but the smell wouldn’t be anywhere near where pee should be.
Even the top of his head has a weird funky smell to it.

And no, it’s not the Fritos smell hahaha, it’s different!! I can’t pin point what it is! I’m just wondering if anyone had a similar issue…

We bathe him either when he really smells or gets dirty - but usually every 2 weeks or so. ",10,1736521194.0,labradoodles,4,1.0,False

Hi so I live with my in laws and have a full time job. My mil does not really work and is home allll day. She will wait until I get home to start cooking so I can help her- she does nothing on her own she won’t even unload a dishwasher until someone comes home so either they do it or someone helps her do it. When I come home from work I love to do a quick workout to get it out of the way- it’s important for me and my me time. I know she hates it but idc. So I’m down with my workout and shower and get downstairs and she goes- “you really need to start helping with the food because I don’t want to stress myself out” and I just stood there like did I hear that right? Stress out? From what? Waking up at 10am having your coffee and sitting and watching tv all day? The only productive thing shell do weekday is maybe a quick mop and vacuum and I’ll do all the other cleanings on the weekends. Am I wrong for at least wanting her to cook just one meal since me and my husband are working all day? It bothers me because if it was the other way around- she would be furious if this was done to her. I don’t mind cooking- I’d prefer it actually but I also don’t like being micromanaged which is what she does whenever I attempt something on my own which is why I just hav stopped. Idk what to do but it is gettttrjng to me and I’ve grown resentment towards her to the point when I dread going home

P.S: it is my in-laws home and we all take turns paying for the taxes (even tho my husbands name isn’t on the house and my in laws and his sisters are). We do pay for some of the bills too. ",0,1736521122.0,Marriage,6,0.33,False
1hy6828,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hy6828/my_mil_is_spending_time_with_us_at_home_and_im/,My MIL is spending time with us at home and I'm constantly angry,"This is going to sound kinda rambly, as I'm still sorting my thoughts on this matter. Also, English is not my first language, so some things are a bit hard to explain grammatically (Sorry for the stereotype).

My MIL came to spend time with my BF (30M) and I (28F) for a week and I'm so frustrated, and in no way it's her fault... kinda.

This past Christmas we split it between my family and his, and while spending some days with MIL she dropped that she got some vacation days and she was going to go to visit us in our city. No question, more of a statement. For me, it was sudden, and I told her I had to sort some things out before greenlighting it, as a friend had some plans to stay at our home in between those dates. She got quite defensive (or I interpreted it as such, as she has a really blunt and harsh way of speaking) and told us that she would get a hotel. We told her to wait a bit, that it wasn't a no, it was more of a ""later"". It took a bit of convincing and back and forth, but we finally agreed with her on some dates, the week right after coming from Christmas break.

I came back from spending the rest of Christmas with my family, and not gonna lie, I was already super drained. I wanted to get to my safe space and recuperate from the energy that my family has and I was aware that I wouldn't get any rest for another week. I got there from the train and already the tone was kind of snappy from both my BF and MIL. I guess I was really sensitive too, and down on my energy but I pushed through it.

The next day, as I rested, I felt a little bit better, and I tried to be a little bit more energetic, but again, she barely spoke, and when she did it was so blunt. I know it's not because she doesn't like me, is more that way of speaking of country people, blunt and no-nonsense. And because my BF is with her, he speaks a bit like that too, so I find myself getting hurt by this manner of speaking.

Now I find myself getting angry at every little thing. MIL cooks? I get angry because she used all of the groceries, or because they use something I was saving. They clean the flat? I get angry because she used my V60 ceramic coffee maker as a sponge strainer (not her fault, as she probably doesn't know what it is and I see why it could resemble a strainer). We're also paying for everything outings and all, which is fine, bc she's our guest. Still, I get a bit angry because I'm used to my parents who barely let us pay for anything, and I find the barely-acknowledging of the invitation a bit impolite.

I try not to show how impatient I am, and I try to understand. I just feel my space invaded. I guess that's it, that I'm angry because I need space, my space and time alone with my BF.

Also, I can't stand her perfume.",3,1736521093.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,1.0,False
1hy67le,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1hy67le/partner_of_12_years3_kids_together_betrayed_me/,"Partner of 12 years,3 kids together betrayed me and im dead inside now.desperate to vent this","Ok so I didn't expect to do this but at this point,like many of you this is all I have left as a last resort to heard and just get shit off my chest.
I(29M) met my S/O (31F) about 12 years ago in a city just a short drive over the bridge.despite the distance I was at the right place at the right time that day when  I most likely would've never had a reason to even go to that city.
She had reached out through fb respectfully about some business.when I pulled up to the spot I see this beautiful girl facing away and I was immediately intrigued.i had yet to see her in person so this day I didn't even know the girl I was looking at was the girl I would be meeting.i made a stupid/cheesy comment to the friends I was with about how I wished the girl I was looking at was the one I was coming to meet..
Little did I know,it was actually her I was looking at.she comes up to the truck to grab her stuff and I can feel everyone staring through me and giving me subtle smile/shoulder bumps basically tryna put me on the spot lol.
When she left I think I texted her something like she was cute or some shit,immediately regretted it and was super embarrassed/anxious since I had barely had any contact at all w this person other than inbox.
Anyways later that night I muster up the courage to call her,shit rings,and rings ,and rings some more,right as I'm about to hang up,boom! She answers.i just wanted to chop it up and have a conversation w her maybe get to pick her Brain a bit.we ended up talking from maybe 12pm to the next morning,we clicked and I felt like interest in each other was mutual.
Some life changing events took course around the same time in my life and I was forced to move,and it was 1hr30min away.at this point I'm already giving up inside,I know there's no shot if there was one before.we had continued to have conversations daily and kept up w each other very well through socials,txts,calls and after a month or 2 of that I felt like we became good friends.
Me moving didn't stop us from trying,maybe 4 months after I moved we were already talking about her coming to visit in person,she didn't drive and I didn't have a car yet so this was a bit difficult,alot of borrowing cars and her getting rides over here.
she visited once the first month,and as time went on the visits became longer and more frequent and I can say this was truly the happiest moment of my life spending all those months in pure bliss and experiencing love like I never felt before,this girl made me complete and I was the most lucky dude on earth to have her and be getting to know her despite some things working against us.when we met she had a son who was 2y/o that she raised alone along with her brother because kids dad was a complete deadbeat and never even tried to do what was right.
Before the year was up from having met her,she calls like usual as she's about to clock in to work but this time the call is different-she's pregnant...(I feel like it's fair to mention that in the past when she had been coming over,she had mentioned that she wasn't able to get pregnant,as in it was impossible)
I had recently come off a traumatic experience in my teen years where I was in a relationship,gf got pregnant,I thought I was doing the right thing by telling Her""im not completely sure I'm ready to be a dad yet"" instead of hiding the truth, I was fucking terrified,I was 16 or 17.never did I say I didn't want to take responsibility or that she couldn't count on me to raise my babies if they came,abortion was never mentioned.well out of the blue a few weeks later that girl pretty much told me she had went to the clinic and got an abortion(really long story,twins)
That stayed with me and still affects me today,so when my current S/O at the time told me she was pregnant,I was extra careful to not say the wrong shit and was still insanely paranoid after,I told her we would do what she thought was best and if it was having my child,I would absolutely step up and be the best dad to my ability that I could possibly;not only for my son but for the boy who she was already raising on her own.she talks about this pregnancy as always says it was the happiest time of her life.i think 1)she felt relief after hearing I wanted to do the right thing and would step up as a father.
2)she had not experienced love in a pregnancy yet,she had only been left alone to deal w her misery and tears completely by herself.
That being said it was a huge contrast from her first son compared to being pregnant with my son,I drowned them in love.
Had a man to man w my pops and once we talked a bit more she was on board with moving in to go through the rest of her pregnancy here with me and that was such a huge win for me and my life,I was on a fast route to the cemetery or prison before I met her and now here I am I year into meeting her and:
She's moving in,we're absolutely crazy for eachother,she's about to have my kid,I landed a great job,got my first car the day she moved in,I went from being a rotten snot-nosed kid to feeling the fire under my ass to be a good dad and it changed me for the best,she changed me for the best.i would talk to my son in her belly,she was obsessed w McDonald's fries and coffee so there we were daily at the drive thru.she was genuinely happy( I believe that) and it reflected on our son,when I first seen him I can't describe the feeling I felt but I remember like yesterday,she said she had never seen me look that way before that day,I cut my sons umbilical chord and welcomed him into the world overflowing with happiness.things seemed to be going like a fairy tale at this point but I think the first real moment of me witnessing her be stressed out and not completely content was 6mo down the road.
You see,I dont learn my lessons and well 6 months down the road from having our first son,she was pregnant all over again.around the time she got tested and found out, I had just broken my femur bone in an accident so this was our first experience feeling the pressure of life and not having things figured out since everything was kinda happening at once.the second pregnancy was tough on her,I could tell and looking back I wish I would've done things so much differently,I was young and still learning in life so I just wasn't aware just how much I was coming up short in assisting w my second son;that being said I was burned out and the lack of sleep from the 2 kids was starting to affect my mental health,my work life,my well being and our relationship in general.i was getting up at 2:45am every day to commute to work,drive 1hr45min away,clock in at 4:30am,drive back around 12:30pm and would get home at 3pm at times w traffic.once I broke my leg it's like everything added up so quickly.I was in extreme pain every day,sleep deprived for almost a year at that point,finances weren't in the best place since I had to stop working for a while,it killed me to have her push me in a wheelchair like a cripple while she has a huge ass watermelon belly-i should've been pushing her( one of the things I'm forever grateful for) to Dr's appointments not the other way around,while she rested at home and got spoiled the first pregnancy,the second time around we were victims of circumstance and she had to get a part-time at a shitty job( which also killed me inside),all the while we have 2 newborns sleeping with us and she's probably feeling all the pressure I already mentioned,plus the fact that I was falling a bit short when it came to my second son,I just didn't have the energy and subsequently didn't make alot of time for him or do alot of the things I did for my first son.when one baby got picked up,the other cried cuz he wanted to be held as well.it was hard but I'm sure things were tougher on her than I can imagine.
Fast forward to today,my oldest(stepson)is 14,Jr is 10 and my youngest is 9.
In 2022 I made some bad choices and ended up getting a prison sentence for a violent crime along w a drug charge.up to this point it had been exclusively her and I the first 12 years but shortly after I went to prison things started to change.
First her mom and sister ""had"" to move in because they were about to end up on the street,I tried to be understanding although I had a gut feeling that things weren't going to go well.few months down the road some wild accusations get thrown my brothers way( that turned up false) and she ended up finding a 2bd 2story appt a city over with the 3 kids,her mom and sister.this was the first time it was just them,none of my family around to keep an eye on things but honestly at this point she had proven her loyalty to me and the things she said I just thought there was no idea she could/would be making up so I felt Like while we had some issues the love was definitely there and we wanted to continue to raise our family once I got home later that year in November.
I want to mention that her family has a habit of doing the same drama everywhere they go and the same patterns keep happening:mom is old,sister is a young adult at 18-19y/o,but neither of them want to work or contribute to anything at all other than maybe her mom will cook and sit down and watch TV all day and say she's watching the kids.they freeload off brother #1 in another state for a year,free housing free food,no bills etc,argument happens and they fall out so sis&mom end up going to stay with brother #2,months later the same thing,mom wants to be the boss and her son&daughter in law aren't happy because they're raising a family in their own home and don't want to be bossed around or told what to do,onto brother #3 they fall out about some money issue and keep bouncing around trying to couch surf wherever they could for free for a while until I got locked up and they seen their opportunity in my gullible girl.i told her"" brother#1 spoiled her and once she didn't like something she stormed out and I get to hear all the calls she would make to my girl and basically bash the dude for anything&everything under the sun"" moved w brother #2 nothing but nice things to say,until she gets kicked out,then she's airing out all their dirty laundry to everyone else along with saying their daughter wasn't her grandkid and couldn't count on her anymore"" same with brother #3 ,so I tell my girl,once the time comes that she has to leave our place what do u think is going to happen? (She's going to talk shit and drag us through the mud like everyone else)
We established very early into my sentence that come time for my parole date,I would be coming home to her and my kids and by then mom&sis would've had a year to save up for their own place.alot of problems arose here and my girl was in the middle hearing the pressure from both sides because they had got comfortable and had no intention of leaving.she said they had an argument about it but in the end her and her sister were in the office getting papers signed that stated"" come november,basically I would be moving in and they would have to be removed from the lease which worked out since at that point they should have saved enough money to do something.their whole stay w my girl was a big vacation,her rent went up 3x and not only did she have 3 kids to care for but 2 grown adults to provide for as well now too.my girl had to go as far as putting in the application FOR HER sister and eventually got her a part time job around 6mo to my release date but even then she would work 1 day of the week for a few hours and just stay home and do nothing the rest of her time.the only bill her sister paid was her phone bill,if my girl didn't bring toilet paper she didn't wipe her ass (seriously) and even blamed my girl for not buying it after 12hr shifts and a commute while she was being a princess cozy sleeping in til 3pm.they did so much shady shit,they were a problem and it stressed my girl out to the max but she was in a tough spot.my kids tell me that they weren't allowed downstairs when her sis's bf came over,they told me they (my kids)would have to scrub the toilets and basically slave cleaning up the whole house so it could look nice for when her bf came over but once he arrived they were put in their room upstairs like animals that were in the way.her mom was ok with all of this,but when it came to me,you know the guy who's been providing for her daughter and kids for over a decade non stop and never once walked out on her,the dude who got her a license,taught her how to drive and put her in a brand new Kia,well when I came over she must've felt threatened so even tho she paid no bills and it was my girls place she would make snarky little comments about what I was doing there etc and at the same time I'm asking my girl like ""what's going on w them are they almost ready to get their own place like we agreed?"" I got brushed off so much on this one,we argued a few times,one of the h
thethings that stood out that hurt me from her the 1st time is when I was upset and basically asked her about her mom &sis's plans to leave,when she would says they're saving up"" I got tired and asked her for a dollar amount,like if they've saved how much do they got,maybe I c put the rest in to help them go and she told me "" it's none of your business"" never had she done that.i kept visiting as much as I could but one night we came in the door and her mom is there waiting and basically tries to lecture us and tell us what to do with our lives,saying she's not going to watch the kids for us (even though that was her excuse for being there and she only left to pick me up and return) so I just snapped,I didn't lose my cool then and there but I walled out and I just told her to take me home...I was just so fed up w hearing this old hag,was so stressed,was already biting my tongue about the fact that they were supposed to have moved out before I even got home and I was buzzed so I just couldn't do it.
The way home I'm asking direct questions and trying to get some definite answers on what the plan is since I can't go on any longer w being treated worse than a stranger or guest,again she tried to brush it off and make light of the situation,pretend she didn't hear me etc.thats when I lost my cool I told her how I felt and my anger came out,all verbal but I'm sure I made her feel like shit I mean she lied to me,she had one job which was to keep up with her fams plans/progress and give them a little push/reminder if needed and I feel like it wasn't taken serious or made a priority so this made me feel like me moving back in wasn't as urgent of a priority for her as was for me.that was the first day in over a decade that I told her I wasn't going to just sit there and get walked on where I didn't think it was fair at all.she dropped me off and we went about 5-6 months without talking.we had a brief phone call once about something I needed to do but she was upset and took it out on me.other than that I didn't make many attempts to reach out since the response I got was so negative.
A certain night,I'm suicidal at this point,I call her and ask to pls hear me out and if she could just bring me my pictures of her and my kids back so i could have something to reminisce about.
When she gets there I'm in my room getting fucked up,shit is super toxic at the beggining,nitpicking,talking shit to me about this the that.i started to give up and just took my pictures and sat away from her and stared at the tv,I don't remember what was said but eventually questions were asked by both of us that led the other to answer with the truth and open up about the hurt and be vulnerable for a moment,we hated eachother in that moment I could feel it,but we both admitted how much we missed eachother and couldn't go without one another.somehow a push was made and then a pull ,then a hug,within minutes were taking out all our feelings,aggression,pain,heartache and frustration on eachother right then and there,I dont think I ever fucked her so rough before,there was a bit in genuine hate for letting months go by without reaching out but hands down was the best sex I've had in my life and she said she felt the same.boom! We're back in business.
We get serious about out living situation,she finally takes it seriously and actually puts her foot down and let's her family know that they had an agreement and they aren't holding their end of the bargain so she wanted to see more progress (i.e sis picking up more days at her job,or even just saving money instead of spending on stupid shit) but this wasn't taken very well and of course started the drama that I warned my girl about from the get-go.they start to try and make my girls life hard,my kids were neglected in many ways,force to do and eat shit they didn't want to,her sister started being extremely disrespectful out of spite and just looking for an excuse to talk shit to my girl in her own place,her mom wasn't doing what she agreed on which was be a grandma basically while my girl is working the entire afternoon so this changed things between them alot.they didn't last much longer and eventually had a big(loud) fight about my girl telling them they had to leave.well we live across from the building manager at that point literally 8 feet separating our doors.i was in the parking lot and my son came running to get me and tell me his mom was fighting,when I'm walking up to the door the manager is already outside her door with a little girl and she asks me if I can tell them to refrain for the yelling and fighting as she had her grandkids over and didn't want that type of drama around.when I walk in they're all yelling at eachother,I grab her from the hips and pull her away towards outside but she's fighting me like crazy(big girl lol)and everytime I get her out the door she runs past me and goes back in to yell and argue again,I kept telling her that the manager wasn't happy and it was best to avoid problems but I think she was just so mad it didn't register.well she gives them 2 weeks to move out,and they eventually go freeload off MY family for a while(yeah)until they are able to get bus tickets to Montana(back to brother#1 that they swore they would never move back in with)
I think by the time I moved back in it was may or June but the point is I was finally in a home with my family and only them w no one else's bullshit to deal with.it was the first time we had our own spot so it felt like huge progress and was just a great feeling I had not felt yet splitting rent w family.I got hired for a decent company 15 mins away and was working and finally getting my girl the break and breath of fresh air she needed.my kids and I finally were spending alot more quality time and doing more things together as well as me and her also investing alot more time on eachother as well,sleeping in the same room again in the super comfy bed I bought her before I got arrested.we subbed to a good internet provider and improved our kids (and our) quality of life in many ways.things were great for a bit there,I was truly happy again...then the call from the manager comes in,she's vague and tries to put it on the landlord and claim she's just doing her job but basically they serve us a 30 day notice.less than 2 months of my dream and now it's coming crashing down already.the last phone call we had with the manager was about 4 days from our notice to leave,she offered us a chance to stay since she wasn't aware that her mom&sis had moved out but at that point we weren't ready to pay 2 months rent on a week's notice and had already moved most things out of the appt since we thought things were final.on that phone call she told us how her family was very problematic a d disrespectful.she said a young girl w perfect english(sister)had called and said that I was bringing girls in and out,as well as cooking drugs in the appt along with selling and using them to/with all the traffic I was bringing,but the manager said "" I know that's bs because I have a ring camera and your husband is very respectful,goes to work,comes home quietly and minds his business and takes care of his kids,on the other hand she is the one always making out with her bf outside your front door and bringing people over who aren't on the lease"" they basically devoted most of their time after they left,to ensuring my girl and I lost that appt.a comment was made to the effect of they'd rather see her struggle alone than be with me.i mean me and my girl already don't deserve the drama after all the help we've given them along with the bs we put up with,but my kids man ,that's what bugs me the most.she knew she wasn't kicking us out to the streets,she was also doing that to my kids and the fact she has the nerve to call and say she misses them and ask other family how they're doing is just infuriating to me,hypocrisy at its finest.
We move out at the end of June and proceed to endure some serious struggles along w our kids.my job stability isn't great because my record,companies hire me then fire me when the backround comes back.just before I moved in my girl totaled the Kia and was stuck driving some bucket Honda pilot that kept having issue after issue.we struggled to find another place,missed the comfort of having our own spot and running our own program.eventually fell into depression and started to cope w drugs here and there just to numb shit.last half of 2024 was absolutely the worst time we've ever lived through since we met but as much as it sucks to say I felt like it brought us closer together.theres days I didn't eat so my kids could.days,no months that me and her had to sleep in the truck,pouring sweat ,getting rawdawgged by mosquitos,waking up restless but having to show up to work.showering at truck stops,we're in a better situation now but those were some tough months,especially the summer.
This bring me to early december,me and her get a hotel room to spend the night and get away,take some Xanax bars and smoke some weed etc.i think its because we never have much free time away from our kids but the conversation got deep,really deep that night.my girl had pulled up a chair next to where I was laying,I was basically fighting to stay awake and felt like I was half way to drifting off into my dream when she suddenly tells me about something in her past that happened and as soon as the words leave her mouth its snaps me back out of it,now I'm sober and wide awake and ask her ""what?"" She's sobbing like never before,12 years it took her to share something w me that I felt we were close enough to be open about 4 or 5 years into our relationship.i didn't want to belive her but I could tell she wasn't lying.it wasn't anything she had fault in or control of,she was a victim of a really traumatic situation and that night she felt ready to open up and tell me about it despite her fears.i could tell she was terrified after she told me,she thought I'd look at her different,she said I prob felt disgusted by being w her,which I assured her she was wrong about.she cried so fucking much and that night and everything slowly fell into place and made sense,why she reacted to certain situations a certain way,why certain words triggered her even if it was said jokingly,why there was certain problems she dealt with through her teens that just didn't have a way out or a easy solution,I understood so much then and there and when I looked at her,I just wanted to die.every bit of pain,sorrow,anger,frustration,anxiety,discomfort I ever put her through made me feel like I didn't deserve to live.i remembered times I made her cry,and seeing her pain that night I just couldn't live with myself knowing I contributed to that.seeing her pour buckets of tears made me feel angst and hopelessness like I never experienced,I couldn't take it away,I couldn't fix it,I couldn't go back in time and change what happened to her and what she went through and I wished I could.that feeling changed me that night,I felt like I evolved volumes overnight as a man because while I had done my best to provide and make her happy in the past,things were different now.i felt like I had a job,duty ,an obligation to this woman,and that job was to assure her of her safety with me and guarantee that as long as I live I wouldn't let her go through any pain remotely close to this again.i was tunnel visioned and laser focused about loving and protecting her with all my heart and soul and making her feel loved.this just took things to another level and while I know I was beyond crazy,helplessly in love w this girl atleast she made me feel like she felt the same.she just looked at me different,I could almost feel the love coming from her when she looked at me,she spoke differently to me,we communicated better and more this point I'm getting ready to finally propose to her again(jail ruined that the 1st time) 
Maybe a day or two after the hotel she goes to work like usual,long commute and I'm at the house w my kids.dont even remember how the convo came up but randomly one of my kids tells me "" mom had a picture on her phone backround of her and some guy kissing,yeah and his names martin"" I shrug them off and keep doing what I'm doing,mainly because at this point I seriously doubted my girl to be even capable of doing anything that would hurt me or affect our relashionship.i guess this was during the 6mo break we had they said,then it started to sink in.were talking and they tell me how mom went on a vacation to Mexico for 2 weeks and the Pic was there when she came back.as much as I want to understand and try justifying it because we technically weren't talking for those months,I just cant.the entire time without her I was miserable and so depressed ,if she wouldn't have showed up when she did I'd probably be dead.i wouldn't even get up to eat or shower on most days,my mental health deteriorated horribly and if I left bed it was to get high or drink to try and cope so talking to any other females or having them over for sex wasn't even on my radar AT ALL.it had been 12 long years so at the point of our break,while we were not talking and keeping our distance,I never stopped believing deep down in my heart that she was mine and I was hers.i didn't expect things to take so long to repair,I guess my hope was she would be mad for a few weeks and try talking things out eventually.when she commented about it briefly she always gave me the feeling that she went through the same or worse so I figured she was going through it too.
I remember asking her a few times if she had talked to,entertained,messed around or tried dating any other guys when we were split.always "" of course not""  ,""I'm the love of her life,if she doesn't have me she doesnt want a relashionship"" etc she told me how she cried every single day and drank herself to sleep because she missed me so bad.all this is going through my head while my kids are there all confirming what my youngest son said,I felt like a sword pierced through my heart..
I'm about to call and I remember how we just got through the situation at the hotel,and how I promised myself I would keep the stress and drama far away from her,I was making an attempt to leave the arguing and fights in the past and just have as positive as a relashionship humanly possible to see her smile more and cry never."" I'm jumping the gun here,I mean we technically were broken up,what if it's not that serious and you get worked up about something that's not worth it and cause a fight/drama""-so I ask my kids, "" have u guys seen anything else that didn't seem right?"" "" any guys that were around or she was talking to while I wasn't here,or anyone that came over?"" 
My son: no dad that's i...well there was this one time.
-go ahead tell me son
One time in the morning we were getting ready for school,we knocked on moms door for her to take us but she wouldn't answer(one says 5 mins one says 20 mins,but point it they were knocking on that door forever) they said they eventually grabbed a fork and unlocked it and mom was laying with some black guy in her bed.the oldest tried to cover for her and say that he had earrings and pink nails and was"" super duper gay "" but my youngin doesn't lie and he told me in front of him that he was just making that up to cover for his mom.i won't try to put my feelings into words at this point,my whole life flashed before my eyes.
I call her.
Ask about the kids saying they seen some black dude in the room w her.
1) denial.has no idea what they are talking about and put simply ""NO,there was never any black guy or any guy at all for that matter in her room""
2) goes off on a 20 min rant about how the kids pranked her once and said there's a midget hiding in the house,and had her looking through every room and door to find this midget that didn't exist.therefore her logic was basically they make shit up that's not true.imagination etc.
I'm putting pressure on her because I know my kids wouldn't just make something like this up and even if one did they wouldn't be able to get away w it because the other 2 brothers would call them out on the bs and I questioned them separately.
3)ok there was a dude there,but it was only because her friend Amanda got beat by her bf and was hiding/running away from him so that's why her and her pimp were in the room.
EZ(so the kids would have seen a black dude along WITH a white girl then right?)
Sounds like she panics and tells me she will call me back and that we are going to sit down and have a talk when she gets home,in person.at that point I'm thinking she's getting ready to tell me some truth,now just tried to come up w a story that fit and made sense with what my kids were saying without making her look too bad.
There was a few more but when she called back she went with there was a friend from work and he got fired for drinking so he offered a bottle he had and she was the one who asked for it.i know it doesn't make sense and it won't either but everytime I tried to entertain the story she was giving me shit just didn't add up or make sense at all,I know her,and sadly even after "" this is the honest truth""  details continued to change to I just pretended to buy it and forgive her and been Living in fucking misery every single day since.i told her to just come clean,I said I would forgive her if she was just honest about it and that if we loved eachother we could work through it possibly.her final story was some shit about this guy only coming to drop the bottle off(at midnight) (to her appt for some reason) and he was on something and devastated about his girl leaving the state and aborting his baby,and that's why it was so hard to get him to leave,bcuz he kept ranting and talking and crying.so I go with that story and bring up a few things on the spot but during these last weeks I've poked a million holes in her fake ass stories.when I asked why tf someone would even be invited over for any reason at all,she just said she knows she messed up.
why wouldn't you just buy your own bottle ? (Dnt remember what she said)
My kids knocked at 7am so how tf does dude make it to sunlight and he's not only in the appt,he's in the room w you,fucking feet away from my kids room,door closed,locked,and mom laying on dudes chest while they both lay in bed,THE BED I BOUGHT,after them knocking for 20 mins... so even though her story changed 5 or 6x we got this far and she's gone from 0% true to 90% true as far as my sons story but she's very vocal about the 'fact'that although she did have him drop off a bottle and understands it looks bad,nothing happened at all.and I'm supposed to believe that shit I guess.i played dumb for a few weeks and watched my heart crumble into dust while she tells me her sweet lies and how much she loves me and another 3029388484 lies she feeds me.maybe 2 or 3 weeks ago I texted her at work and pretty much told her she fucked up and we were done.she played sad and acted like she was devastated and cried to fix things and that she'd understand if she did something but it's messed up were ending it over something that never happened.we talked alot and somewhat agreed to leave it alone,she actually convinced me for a sec there was she WAS telling the truth,that's just how blinded out of love for her I was.she swore on her dead dads life and a bunch of other shit so I told her I'd leave it in the past but shit was going to change and she agreed w all the conditions,she deleted all her socials in front of me,every phone number that I pointed at got erased,a bunch of shit that made my dumbass belive I had some kind of control lol
Now after a week of having plenty of sleepless nights to think of things in silence,I'm so mad I didn't see right thru it instantly and even let her return from work that day.ive been wanting to tell her about this every single fucking day since but everytime I clear my throat to say it it just won't come out.last time she asked why I said things wouldn't work out I told her "" cuz u fucking cheated on me dude"" and she just responded with"" oh you're still going on about that shit wow"" and dismissed me like I was crazy.
I've wrote 14 pages front and back 3x,the first two I burned or tossed but the last one is there in my notebook on the shelf,its just as hard as talking about it though I can't bring myself to show it to her but the last couple days I've made my mind up for good and I think she has noticed the change in me and prob feels what's coming.its the last thing,the hardest thing I've ever had to do but ,I HAVE to.if she doesn't respect me I need to have some respect for myself atleast and not let her think she's going to get off scott-free,just to do it again in the future.
Sorry for the wall of texts but this helped me so fucking much,I'm too embarrassed to mention it to anyone I know and already don't talk to hardly anyone as it is.at this point I've been betrayed and hurt worse than I ever thought possible,love isn't something I care to find or look for anymore.i know if she loved me she wouldn't have done this shit to me,and I've sat down and thought well damn we all make mistakes,we're human right? Correct and I can forgive someone I love for being human and making a mistake,but chosing to lie to my face over and over again.letting all these weeks go by and feeling no guilt or remorse at all to finally get the truth off you're chest.continuing to live life as if nothing happened,looking me in the eyes and saying you love me,planning to do IVF so we can have a daughter,all while knowing what you did and knowing you lied about it,that's some cold hearted shit and that's the first time I felt fear genuinely from her because if she can do all this and lie to me with a straight face and not once does it eat at her conscience when she looks at me,I wonder what else she's capable of or what she's already done that I haven't found out about yet.
I can forgive a mistake but a liar I'm not so sure.either way the fact remains that for the rest of our lives here in this lifetime,there will NEVER be legitimate trust between us again and while my first though was to pay her back tenfold,maybe post some revenge porn or someshit,I realize I don't have to stoop to the level she did so I'm going to just speak my mind and let her know what I think and feel.the sad part is I couldn't ever hurt her because I truly 
do love her and I know that I will always keep loving her,she's the love of my life,but it's time for us to go our separate ways.whatever she was looking for with those other dudes she can feel free to chase it guilt free but when she realizes that she wants real love one day,that train will have passed...when she needs a shoulder to cry on or someone to vent her deepest traumas to,atleast I know she has 2 dudes she can count on at minimum.
I can't stay most of all because I know it wouldn't ever be the same,I won't ever look at you the same way I once did,as an angel incapable of harming me,the innocent girl I stopped trying to catch doing me wrong because I realized it just wasn't going to happen.
During the last 12 years I matured,my love grew so strong for you,I learned what loyalty was and gave it to you religiously,I strive to be better to you and my kids everyday,but it seems like at the same time you were doing the opposite and falling out of love,letting lust and temptation win and turn these last 12 years of my life into NOTHING.so much I didn't write and I realize I won't ever get it all off my chest after writing these out so many times but fuckit hopefully you get the point.best of luck to you❤️thanks for all the beautiful times we shared from the bottom of my heart,but the man you knew is gone forever this time.",0,1736521058.0,heartbreak,0,0.5,False

1hy66ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hy66ub/my_mums_husband_has_a_long_history_of_gambling/,My mum’s husband has a long history of gambling and I could use some advice ,"They don’t have much money. My mum married him in 2016 after being together for 6 years. This is his 3rd marriage and a BIG reason behind his 1st marriage falling apart was because he lost hundreds of thousands (AUD) of his family’s savings (his wife came from money, he was getting by) while living a double life, betting on horses/dogs while also working with trainers and jockeys to “fix” races. 

In late 2018 when he was working in Singapore and I was visiting, I witnessed 17.8K AUD lost in 3 weeks on his Sportsbet account. The ONLY time I’ve seen any of his “betting” history. Of course when I spoke to him about it he said he won 50K a few weeks earlier so it was no big deal. 

They lost everything during Covid because he invested in purchasing a Bathroom Modular Manufacturing business at the every end of 2019 and of course the timing was brutal. 

His friend who invested in the company is a genuine awesome guy, is a Surgeon, is married to a Doctor, and is rolling in money. He took pity on my Step Dad and allowed them to buy one of his properties at well under market value. They have been since paying him off without incurring interest. 

So now a big reason behind this thread is this: 

The Doctor friend just days ago said that they don’t have make any further payments until they sell the house, whenever that is in the future. SO they finally have the ability to save money for their retirement, travel a little bit, etc.

I am concerned because I know he still gambles and has betting Apps on his phone. Frequently watching horses and dogs. He also owns a few Greyhounds and has done so for about 8 years.

My mum is a full time carer of her mother (96yo) and his mother (91yo who lost her home being mortgaged for the business during Covid) so cannot work. Despite her having an amazing work ethic her entire life.

She lives super frugally and doesn’t have much. Genuinely ridiculously careful with money. She wouldn’t even buy a coffee when she use to work. 

She has zero access to his bank statements and I know that Gambling is a DISEASE. Am I overreacting that given his history, there should be some transparency? I’m worried that he can continue to hemerage money. Given what I saw in Singapore (Asked if I could place a Formula 1 bet on his Sportsbet account because I was in town for the Singapore GP race and didn’t have one. That’s when I clicked on “pending” after placing my bet and saw 17.8K AUD lost in 3 weeks) and given his history of living a double life losing his previous wife’s money, I know he is capable of losing everything in the blink of an eye, and the fact he doesn’t have to make repayments on their house any longer (for now) I’m extremely concerned for my Mum. 

If he has nothing to hide is it wrong for my Mum to ask for him to be transparent about his recent Sportsbet & TAB transactions for her own peace of mind that he isn’t losing much? Is it reasonable for her to, once again given his history, be able to see his bank statements? I consider gambling like alcoholism, a disease. One that can wipe out a family/life in no time at all. Which is why this is my one and only concern for her. 

Appreciate any advice. I don’t know how to approach this but I don’t want my mum to be naive and lose everything for a second time. I couldn’t live with myself. She trusts him completely and thinks it’s something he no longer has a problem with. 😢

","Morocco is a land of contrasts, where the old world meets the new, and where the desert meets the sea. As a local, I’m excited to share with you the places that truly capture the essence of this beautiful country. Whether you’re a history buff, a foodie, or an adventure seeker, Morocco has something for everyone. Let’s dive into the 10 best places you absolutely must visit.

# 1. Marrakech: The Red City’s Heartbeat

https://preview.redd.it/99d41syag6ce1.jpg?width=1399&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03aa47e9c28de70cb60c6da6ba4bad3accfdf95e

Marrakech is where the pulse of Morocco truly beats. Start your journey in Jemaa el-Fnaa, the city’s vibrant square. By day, it’s a bustling market where you can haggle for spices, textiles, and trinkets. As night falls, it transforms into a magical spectacle of street performers, story-tellers, and food stalls serving up delicious street food like grilled squid and Moroccan pancakes.

Don’t miss the Bahia Palace, a masterpiece of Moroccan architecture, or the serene Majorelle Garden, a haven of tranquility in the heart of the city. For a taste of local life, explore the souks, where you can find everything from traditional clothing to handmade pottery. And if you’re looking for a authentic experience, head to the Gueliz district, where you’ll find a mix of local cafes and international restaurants.

# 2. Chefchaouen: The Blue Pearl of Morocco

https://preview.redd.it/8ojlteufg6ce1.jpg?width=2121&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ac7c9142f8528b3b90376af9c8b52e2d2e64d66

Nestled in the Rif Mountains, Chefchaouen is a feast for the eyes. The town’s blue-painted buildings and narrow streets create a picturesque scene that feels straight out of a postcard. But there’s more to Chefchaouen than just its pretty facade. Take a walk up to the Spanish Kasbah for stunning views of the town and the surrounding mountains. Visit the local market to pick up some handicrafts, and don’t miss the opportunity to try some of the local tagine dishes.

# 3. Fes: The Soul of Morocco

https://preview.redd.it/0i0td0nhg6ce1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=45afccdfc53506f1a0218dd9f81ea6d4e9e5d731

Fes is Morocco’s cultural and spiritual heart. As you wander through the labyrinthine streets of the Fes el-Bali medina, you’ll feel like you’ve stepped back in time. Visit the Al Quaraouiyine University, one of the oldest in the world, and the Bou Inania Madrasa, a stunning example of Islamic architecture. For a unique experience, visit the tanneries, where you can watch leather being dyed using traditional methods. And for a taste of local life, head to the Nejjarine Square, where you can enjoy a cup of mint tea and watch the world go by.

# 4. The Merzouga Desert: A Journey into the Sahara

https://preview.redd.it/4wbri8rmg6ce1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d34d26dfab53c6585a4433a4c4f8ccc907f75c3f

No trip to Morocco is complete without a visit to the Sahara Desert. The desert’s vast dunes, stark beauty, and endless horizon will leave you in awe. Take a camel trek into the desert, and spend a night under the stars in a traditional nomad camp. If you’re feeling adventurous, try your hand at sandboarding or quad biking. And don’t forget to watch the sunrise over the dunes – it’s a moment you’ll never forget.

# 5. Casablanca: The Modern Face of Morocco

https://preview.redd.it/b1sq3uvog6ce1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84c6979e656db2a78c21cd28db9bdc55b359c523

Casablanca is Morocco’s largest city, and its modern face. The city’s Hassan II Mosque is a must-see, with its stunning architecture and oceanfront location. But there’s more to Casablanca than just its skyline. Take a walk along the Corniche, where you can enjoy stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean. Visit the old medina, where you can explore the city’s historical roots, and don’t miss the opportunity to try some of the city’s famous seafood dishes.

# 6. Essaouira: Where the Wind Meets the Sea

https://preview.redd.it/i14fohtrg6ce1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21af8a32fabcf096ccc8097c925cdf974f6e3097

Essaouira is a coastal town with a laid-back vibe. The town’s blue-and-white buildings, art galleries, and seafood restaurants make it a popular spot with both locals and tourists. But Essaouira is also a hub for windsurfing and kitesurfing, thanks to its strong sea breezes. If you’re looking for a more relaxed experience, take a walk along the ramparts, where you can enjoy stunning views of the ocean, or visit the local market to pick up some handicrafts.

# 7. The Atlas Mountains: A Journey into Nature

https://preview.redd.it/t3a72z0wg6ce1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5ba008d7d7c2ee6800143657914cbf8caeced0f

The Atlas Mountains are Morocco’s natural playground. The mountains offer a range of activities, from hiking and trekking to skiing and snowboarding. Visit the Ouzoud Waterfalls, it is a great addition to your [Morocco tours](https://www.travelofmorocco.com) and one of Morocco’s most stunning natural attractions, or take a trip to the village of Imlil, where you can explore the surrounding mountains and meet the local Berber communities. And for a truly unique experience, visit the Toubkal National Park, where you can hike to the summit of North Africa’s highest peak.

# 8. Rabat: The Capital City

Rabat is Morocco’s capital, and its political and administrative center. The city’s blend of old and new makes it a fascinating place to explore. Visit the Hassan Tower, a symbol of the city’s history, and the Royal Mausoleum, where Morocco’s kings are buried. For a taste of local life, head to the Souissi district, where you can explore the city’s markets and enjoy a cup of mint tea in one of the many local cafes.

# 9. Ouarzazate: The Hollywood of Morocco

https://preview.redd.it/4q49i9nbh6ce1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=222c269ffe1e195032284029e4c184478b8b3af8

Ouarzazate is known as the “Hollywood of Morocco” thanks to its film industry. The city is home to several film studios, and has been the setting for many famous movies, including “Gladiator” and “Game of Thrones.” Visit the Ait Benhaddou kasbah, a UNESCO World Heritage site that has been used as a filming location for many movies. And if you’re looking for a more authentic experience, take a trip to the Draa Valley, where you can explore the traditional villages and learn about the local way of life.

# 10. Tangier: The Crossroads of Cultures

https://preview.redd.it/kjbakg9gh6ce1.jpg?width=2457&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21b3606693de78f0cfee272a6510357fc698eda6

Tangier is a city of contrasts, where the Mediterranean meets the Atlantic, and where European and African cultures collide. The city’s history as a melting pot of cultures is reflected in its architecture, cuisine, and people. Visit the Kasbah, the city’s old fortress, and the Caves of Hercules, a series of ancient caves that have been used for centuries. For a taste of local life, head to the Grand Socco, where you can enjoy a cup of coffee in one of the many local cafes.

1hy5ung,https://www.reddit.com/r/TLRY/comments/1hy5ung/czechia_to_regulate_lowthc_cannabis_in_2025/,Czechia to regulate low-THC cannabis in 2025,"Published on 08.01.2025

The move to regulate low-THC cannabis is not exactly the same as full legalization, but is a step toward its broader acceptance.

Czechia is set to introduce regulated sales of kratom and cannabis with up to 1 percent THC starting in July 2025.

This development follows the implementation of the Psychomodulatory Substances Act earlier this year, which establishes a new legal framework for regulating certain psychoactive substances. The move, however, does not legalize the recreational use of cannabis with higher THC levels, which remains prohibited. Here’s a breakdown of the new regulations, how they will work, and how they compare to laws in other countries.

What substances are being regulated?

The regulation focuses on substances deemed to pose low public health and social risks based on current scientific evidence. These include Kratom and kratom extracts, known for their stimulant and pain-relieving effects; cannabis with up to 1 percent THC, a low-potency form of cannabis with minimal psychoactive effects. Cannabis extracts and tinctures with up to 1 percent THC are also included.

# Easier access to medical cannabis coming to Czechia:

Here's what to know The cannabinoid HHC (hexahydrocannabinol) and its derivatives, previously banned, are under review but are not included in the list of substances eligible for sale.

Low-cannabis THC can be consumed in dried flowers used for smoking or vaping, oils and tinctures, edibles like gummies or chocolates, and topical creams. Low-THC cannabis is often marketed for its therapeutic potential for stress reduction and pain relief rather than recreational use or intoxication.

How will regulation work?

The new rules include stringent conditions for the sale of these substances, which can only be sold in dedicated stores with age restrictions, barring children from entering. Automated sales, such as vending machines, are explicitly prohibited, while online sellers must also operate physical storefronts. All retailers must verify the quality of the products and provide detailed information on the composition and recommended dosages to buyers.

How are substances regulated?

The regulation of psychoactive substances in the Czech Republic is governed by the Psychomodulatory Substances Act, which categorizes substances into three distinct lists.

The first category, Prohibited Addictive Substances, includes substances that are banned outright due to their high risk to public health and potential for abuse, such as heroin or methamphetamine. The second category, Substances Under Review, encompasses new psychoactive substances with effects that are not yet fully understood. These substances are studied for up to two years to determine their risks and potential uses. For example, recently emerging cannabinoids like HHC (hexahydrocannabinol) and its derivatives have been placed under review. The third category, Psychomodulatory Substances, includes low-risk substances deemed safe for regulated sale under strict conditions. Examples include kratom, a plant-based product often used for relaxation, and low-THC cannabis (containing 1 percent THC or less), which is being proposed for sale in specialized stores.

# Country comparison

Regulations for low-THC cannabis and kratom vary worldwide. Germany allows medical cannabis but bans kratom, while Switzerland permits cannabis with up to 1 percent THC, similar to Czech plans. The Netherlands tolerates cannabis in coffee shops but restricts kratom. In the U.S., recreational cannabis is legal in some states, though kratom faces state-level bans. Thailand recently decriminalized kratom and allows low-THC cannabis sales.

The Ministry of Health collaborates with the State Institute of Public Health to evaluate and classify these substances. Additionally, the European Commission is currently reviewing the Czech Republic’s accompanying regulations, which are anticipated to be finalized by mid-2025, paving the way for a structured and transparent regulatory framework.

# Still not legalization, but a step forward

Czechia’s move to regulate low-THC cannabis is not exactly the same as full legalization, but it is a step toward broader acceptance and regulation of cannabis use. The new legislation focuses on products like hemp-derived CBD products, which can be sold and used more easily. The recreational use of cannabis with higher THC levels remains prohibited.

# [New campaign aims to legalize, regulate Czech cannabis market](https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/new-campaign-aims-to-legalize-regulate-czech-cannabis-market)

In essence, this regulation is a form of decriminalization for low-THC cannabis. Still, it stops short of full legalization, which would involve a broader framework for adult recreational use and sales.

# Czechia’s move could be seen as part of a growing trend in Europe, where countries are exploring more relaxed cannabis policies, but the full legalization of cannabis is still not in place.

1hy5sfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1hy5sfo/my_customer_kept_telling_me_his_angel_number/,My Customer Kept Telling Me His Angel Number,"When I was in college, I worked part time at the local coffee shop. It wasn’t my dream job, but the pay was good so I couldn’t complain. 

There was one regular who was always during my shift. He always came in at 1:15pm, sat at the same table, ordered the same meal, and ate quietly while drawing in his notebook. He was always polite and tipped well, so I didn’t mind. 

One day I asked another server about him. 

“Oh, that’s Danny! I think he’s a little slow. He never talks - he only ever communicates in pictures. But he’s a real sweetheart.”

He *was* a sweetheart, just shy. I brought his food every day and smiled at him. One day he drew a picture on the bottom of his receipt - a small bird. I liked it and told him so. From then on, every day he’d draw me a picture in his sketchbook. Birds, cats, flowers. They always made me smile. 

One day he drew a picture of bird wings with the number 119 written beneath them. I asked what it meant, but he just pointed at the wings and the number. So I did some research. Apparently 119 is an “angel number” - it represents new beginnings, positive energy, and prosperity. I thought it was sweet that he’d draw that for me, so I hung it up behind the counter. I guess he liked that, because afterward all his pictures were the same as that one. 

One day a young man entered the shop. As I walked toward him to ask what he wanted, I saw an expression on Danny’s face I’d never seen before - complete, utter terror. As I passed by Danny, the new customer pulled a gun from his jacket and aimed it at me. 

Everything next happened in slow motion. He pulled the trigger. Danny jumped from his seat and dove in front of me. There was a loud *bang*. Danny fell to the floor. I screamed. The shooter raised the gun to his own head and fired. 

The police eventually came, but too late. Danny died holding my hand and smiling at me. 

Weeks later, his mother visited me at the shop. 

“I just wanted to thank you. Danny didn’t have many friends, but he really liked you. Thanks for being kind to him.”

“It was my pleasure,” I replied. “He was a really sweet person. And a good artist - his pictures always brightened my day.”

“Really?” she replied. “Can I see one?”

I showed her the ones behind the counter. “Apparently he was very big on his angel number - he drew it for me all the time.”

At that moment, I realized that the wings in the picture looked just like those on the jacket of the man who’d shot Danny. 

Then I looked over - his mother was gaping at the picture in shock. 

“What?” I asked, concerned.

1hy5qy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/1hy5qy2/shaving_as_the_perfect_hobby/,Shaving as the Perfect Hobby?,"I got into safety razors and wet shaving over a decade ago after inheriting my grandfather’s shaving kit—two vintage Gillettes and a boar brush stamped *“Made in West Germany.”* For years, wet shaving became my ritual. It wasn’t just about getting a close shave; it was about slowing down, appreciating the tools, and taking a moment for myself.

But then life sped up. I traded my safety razor for a cartridge and foam, chasing convenience. Shaving became a chore, something to get through, not something to enjoy. I didn’t think much about what I’d lost—until recently.

Picking up that old kit again felt like reconnecting with an old friend. Holding those tools again was like stepping into a time machine, back to when I first got into wet shaving more than a decade ago. This morning, as I lathered up, I had a thought: **shaving might just be the perfect hobby.**

Here’s why.

**1. It’s Low-Cost**

Unlike so many hobbies marketed to men—watches, cars, knives, guns, coffee, cycling—wet shaving is refreshingly inexpensive. For less than $100, you can assemble a fantastic kit: a solid razor, a quality brush, some soap or cream, and blades. Even at the high end, the investment is modest compared to most other hobbies. This accessibility makes it as democratic as it is enjoyable.

**2. It’s Self-Care Disguised as Utility**

Shaving forces you to pause. There’s no rushing through a good wet shave. You have to slow down, be present, and focus. It’s an act of self-care camouflaged as a morning routine. And let’s face it, in a world increasingly dominated by distraction and haste, there’s something grounding about the ritual.

**3. It Engages All Your Senses**

Wet shaving is a feast for the senses. The scent of a good soap or aftershave lingers long after you rinse your razor. The tactile pleasure of swirling a badger brush through a bowl of lather is unmatched. There’s the aesthetic appeal too—vintage razors, minimalist packaging, and the timeless elegance of brands like Semogue, Ach Brito, Omega or Proraso. About the only sense left out is taste—though I suspect a few adventurous souls have sampled the sandalwood.

**4. It’s Practical**

Unlike some hobbies that seem to collect dust more than attention, shaving is practical. You’re not just collecting razors or brushes for the sake of it. You’re using them, regularly. They’re tools that bridge the gap between utility and craftsmanship, and there’s something deeply satisfying about that.

**5. It’s a Welcoming Community**

Every hobby has its crowd, but the wet shaving community stands out for its friendliness. Whether it’s sharing tips, swapping products, or just trading stories, the vibe here is overwhelmingly positive. It’s rare to find a group where newcomers and seasoned veterans alike are met with the same warmth and enthusiasm.

\*\* 

There’s something about the feel of a safety razor, the smell of a good soap, and the feel of a nice shaving brush. It’s not just shaving; it’s a ritual, one that turns an everyday task into something timeless. And I’ve realized: the best hobbies aren’t the ones that cost the most or take the longest—they’re the ones that remind you to pay attention. Wet shaving does that perfectly.",21,1736519763.0,wicked_edge,8,0.97,False

I just needed to tell Someone, I can't talk about this with anyone I'm close to..  
I've NEVER felt such deep desperation in my entire life, and I've had pretty low lows. Oh god..  
  
My bf and I had sex on the 30.december, 3 days after my period had ended. We did use a condom, but only for the 2nd half of it..   Since this Monday (the 6th) - which is Exactly 2 weeks before my period should begin, and 1 week since sex -  I started to feel strange, woozy, super dehydrated (thought it was bcs of coffee or adhd meds), need to pee all the time ( always do, i drink tons of water, but this is ridiculous), my boobs are large and sore (one of them much bigger), I have a weird bitter taste in my mouth, little apetite (could be the meds,recently had dose increased), I get hot at night and have had creamy/slimy discharge. All of these got progressively worse since Monday. I am very regular, 28 day cycle on the dot, and my boobs usually swell idk 3 to 6 days before period. This time it's much earlier, and it also feels different than usual.. they've never been so big (i have itty bitties). I also have a lot of acne which I normally get right before period, not in the middle of my cycle. I'm bloated and have mild cramping (also happens right before period). I have random body aches.  
  
My body feels so off.. I fit almost all the early pregnancy symptoms..I am RIDDLED with anxiety, I can't breathe..  I'm desperately pleading to god or just to the ether Please please dont let me be pregnant.. Im praying that this is some weird placebo, stress, or just all in my head... a fever dream..   
  
I'm 26, but in no position to have a child, finantially or emotionally. I can barely take care of myself.  I've just gotten my ADHD diagnosis a year ago, which was recently 'updated' to AuDHD. I've been unemployed for almost 2 years, failed my Masters, struggled in school, socially, emotionally, always felt dumb, out of place, less than and awkward. I've lost friends, a degree, opportunities, money and confidence, and I just couldn't fathom why am I always behind, unable to do things others are sailing through. Why can't I just sit down and focus and do the work. And I Knew something was wrong with me..   
I've been depressed, anxious, spiraling and a slew of constant dissappointments. I've often had sui\*idal thoughts, I was in a deep hole, overwhelmed, life was unbearable.. And finally after my diagnosis, everything started to make sense.   
I'm still experimenting with medication, but only now I'm starting to feel slightly better, but nowhere near good/stable enough for a child. I myself feel like a toddler. Still haven't dug myself out of that hole. Still don't have a job (but im going to language school, a small win) and I just.. Can't. 

My boyfriend would love to have a kid, despite my situation (he supports me), he is so ready. I'm not even close.. We agreed that once I get my shit together - then yes. But i thought that would be years from now.. Jesus..this cant be happening.

I'm so conflicted. I thought I knew how I would act if I was in this situation, but.. I just cannot have a kid. I CAN'T. Not now.... I'm raised catholic, my family is catholic (mom is more chill, dad and grandma are extreme, uncle's a priest) and I just don't know what to do. I mean, I'm not even sure I am pregnant, but I'm certain that I'm in no state to have a kid.. And if I do terminate, I can't tell anyone, especially my bf, as he would convince me otherwise. Can't tell my family, afraid to tell friends. I'm so scared..

  
 Does it seem like I am pregnant?.. Futile question, I know, but...I'm at my wits end.  
  
I've ordered a bunch of tests, but earliest I can test is in the middle of next week. I'm gonna go insane. I'm losing it. Imagining disaster scenarios.. Please no...please no

Let me know if I've committed a faux pas posting here. 

The Gift 

“You came back,” Rook said, having just kicked open the kitchen pantry. Balanced in her hands was a silver platter with a matching coffee set she discovered in the Treviso markets. 

She remembered the horned merchant who sold her the piece months ago. She was too charming for Rook's coin purse to stand a chance. Rook approached her, lanterns glowing, pedestrians mulling. Lucanis had just purchased everyone else at The Lighthouse a trinket and was headed in the direction of a cafe they were meeting his cousin at. Rook was certain their secretive rendezvous was only one of many happening on the cobblestone streets that night. While he was distracted, Rook noticed the shiny glint of the percolator and its burnished purple base. 

“You’ll never taste a better cup than the one brewed in this thing,” the seller beamed. “At least, according to my grandmother. An old family heirloom – only selling it because she had two others just like it,” she cackled at Rook’s raised eyebrow. “Don’t worry. This one is still special. But we’ve got to clear out her house. Loved the woman, don’t get me wrong, but she didn’t know how to say no to a deal….what about you?” Rook noticed a rather large amount of fine dishware, lace, rugs, and fur-lined jackets displayed at the stall. 

“Your grandmother and I have something in common,” Rook chuckled, and tossed a handful of coins on the table. “Do you deliver?” 

That was the first and last night Lucanis and Rook had smiled at each other. 

Her stomach churned thinking of where the grinning merchant would be now. Mercifully, dead – torn apart quickly. But there was an equal chance she escaped the initial dragon attack, only to be puppeted by the poison that now pulsed throughout the city Rook grew up in. And it was Rook’s fault. Or at least that was the accusation Lucanis and Viago had spit at her, when she arrived the night of the attack, hours too late. 

She left them seething on the rooftops that night, unsure if her decision to prioritize Minrathous over Treviso would have cost her Lucanis forever. Unsure if she was ever going to get the chance to show Lucanis what she bought him in the markets before they were gone. 
So much had happened since then.
She plopped it down on the small wooden desk he had set up next to his cot that had been empty for weeks. 

“For me?” Lucanis purred, his lips in a slight half-smirk. 

They both stared at the shine of the silver in the candlelight, instead of at each other. 

“You know what I’m trying to do here. What my task is. What Varric left me with. I couldn’t go to Treviso just because it’s mine.” 

Lucanis brought his gaze to Rook’s. “It was an impossible choice,” he murmured, “but I…hate you for it.” 

Rook searched for a glint of purple in his eyes, but there wasn’t any. Only his usual, human black.

“Let me make you a cup,” he said, “there are two mugs, after all.” 

Rook sighed and sat herself down on the bed, the only spot in the dusty pantry-turned-hideout. She preferred tea and he knew it. But you didn’t say no when the First Talon’s grandson made you coffee. He had managed to drag baskets of roasted beans to The Fade itself; it was essentially the only personal affect he brought with him when he first joined the team. 

He got to work. The silence between them was desperately formal as he scooped, grinded, and tapped the fresh powder into the filter. He stepped outside, and soon returned with a steaming kettle. As he poured the water into the pot, Rook smelled something burn, and then something sweet. 

He handed Rook a mug, and slowly sat beside her, cradling his own. 

“Thank you for the gift,” he said, before sipping.
 
There was a pause. 

“Our people’s lives aren’t more important than others,” Rook said, chest tight. “And if I had gone to Treviso - it would’ve - it would’ve sent that message.” 

Her trainer, Heir, smiled in her mind. Missing, presumed dead, now. “And as we know. It’s the message that matters.” 

Despite herself, tears started to fall down Rook’s cheeks. She felt as if something had blighted her, too. She took a shaky sip and was surprised at how comforting it was. 

She let the warmth spread through her. 

Lucanis, who had been a mythic figure her whole life - an assassin of the Dellamorte House who never missed his mark; the favourite of the First Talon with cheekbones sharper than his dagger - sniffed beside her, and soon, was crying too. It was terrifying.

They sat together, bodies shaking next to one another, feeling their lives evaporate and spin around them. 

“I understand,” Lucanis moaned quietly. 

He put an arm around Rook. She felt him pull her to his shoulder to use as a pillow, and he leaned on her in turn. The heat of his body felt as nice as the coffee.

“I won’t leave you again,” he said. 

“I promise. My blade is yours. My life is yours.” 

After a few heartbeats, Rook gently detached herself from his side-embrace and stood up. 

“Thank you, Lucanis.” 

She placed her mug on the tray, and left the room.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to outdoor gatherings, a rectangular fire pit propane is more than just a source of warmth. It transforms your space into a cozy haven for friends and family, making every gathering memorable. Let’s explore the benefits of incorporating this stylish piece into your outdoor setting.

### Versatile Design

One significant advantage of a rectangular fire pit propane is its versatile design. Unlike traditional round fire pits, the rectangular shape fits seamlessly into various outdoor layouts. Whether you have a spacious backyard or a compact patio, this type of fire pit offers flexibility in placement. You can use it as a central feature or tuck it into a corner without compromising style or function.

### Sufficient Seating Space

The rectangular design provides ample space for seating. This is essential for larger gatherings where you want everyone to enjoy the warmth of the fire. Unlike smaller fire pits, which may force guests to sit close or crammed together, a rectangular fire pit allows for better interaction among guests.

### Effortless Lighting and Control

Using propane for your fire pit adds a layer of convenience. Starting the fire is as easy as flipping a switch or turning a knob, allowing you to begin enjoying the fire without the hassle of gathering firewood or dealing with kindling. Additionally, propane allows you to control the flame size, ensuring the perfect ambiance for your outdoor gathering—whether you want a gentle glow or a roaring flame.

### Low Maintenance

Another benefit of choosing a rectangular fire pit propane is its low maintenance requirements. Unlike wood-burning fire pits, which can leave behind ash and debris, propane models are cleaner and easier to maintain. This means less time spent on cleanup and more time spent enjoying your outdoor experience.

### Safety Features

Safety is paramount during outdoor gatherings, and propane fire pits often come equipped with various safety features. Many models have automatic shut-off valves that prevent gas leaks, ensuring your peace of mind. Additionally, they produce a cleaner burn, limiting smoke and reducing the risk of smoke inhalation for you and your guests.

### Eco-Friendly Choice

In an age where environmental responsibility is key, rectangular fire pit propane serves as an eco-friendly option. Propane burns cleanly, emitting less carbon monoxide and particulate matter compared to traditional wood fires. By opting for a propane fire pit, you’re contributing to a reduced environmental impact while still enjoying the warmth and ambiance of a fire.

You can enjoy s'mores in the summer or keep warm during winter festivities, making it an all-season feature of your outdoor space.

### Creating an Inviting Atmosphere

There seem to be two main approaches:

Camp 1: Start with a proven model and improve it. Think about successful local businesses - maybe there's a coffee shop that took the Starbucks concept but made it more personal and community-focused. Or a cleaning service that copied the basic model but added eco-friendly products and better scheduling.

Camp 2: Create something completely unique. Like that first food truck in your city that combined two unlikely cuisines, or the repair shop that started doing house calls when everyone else required drop-offs.

The ""proven model"" approach offers:

* Known customer demand
* Established pricing references
* Clear operational guidelines to learn from
* Easier to get loans (banks love proven concepts)
* Simpler to explain to customers

The ""completely new"" path provides:

* Less direct competition
* Potential for higher profits
* Chance to build a unique brand
* No predetermined customer expectations
* Opportunity to solve unmet local needs

For those who've been in business for a while - which path did you choose? Did you start with a proven concept and add your twist, or did you venture into uncharted territory? What made you choose one over the other?

Would love to hear your real-world experiences, especially how it affected your first year in business.",2,1736519527.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False
1hy5n5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Delphitrial/comments/1hy5n5k/manifesto_from_andrew_baldwins_interview_on_dd/,Manifesto from Andrew Baldwin's Interview on DD - Part 1,"I've had 30 cups of coffee and I deeply regret volunteering myself for this project. However, I am committed to making detailed notes. Mr. Baldwin was quite rambling, following disconnected associations, breaking temporal continuity mid-story to flash forward/backward in time, and changing the subject he is speaking about mid-sentence. It was difficult to follow his reasoning, but I now understand the creative force behind the Franks memo.

\- Bob and Ali introduce the podcast and express excitement about the ongoing interviews.

\- Andrew Baldwin joins the podcast and there is a discussion about vinyl collecting and music appreciation.

\- Baldwin gives some background information on his family, upbringing, and a variety of jobs he worked prior to attending law school.

\- He stops this narrative to point out that law school certainly doesn’t teach you what to do when Odinists are guarding your client, for example, but how to deal with it, you might have learned from someone who came into the Dairy Queen and how you dealt with that.

\- He applied to 10 law schools, but he was only accepted at the University of Akron which is where he attended. One of his children has also entered the profession and was recently accepted as a public defender.

\- Baldwin mentions that his son’s law school term paper topic was an examination of how police police themselves, with an emphasis on effectiveness and optimizing that process.

\- He has a diatribe about key LE figures in the case: “In this case, with everything that was going on, I actually went to the State Police Internal Affairs to report what I thought was some wrongdoing that was going on. We can talk about that later. And that was an hour-long conversation, and I have heard crickets - not so shockingly - since that conversation happened, reporting a variety of what I thought were wrong deeds and wrongdoing. Jerry Holeman and Doug Carter out calling us and calling me in particular ‘unethical.’ I want to say right now at the top, please file something against me. Please file an ethics violation; there is a disciplinary board here that monitors lawyers, and if I’ve done something that is truly unethical, then I would beg you to file something. The problem is, I haven’t, so much like everything else they’ve done, they spout a bunch of stuff without the facts to back it up, and they hope that it sticks, and people will be out there believing it, and we’ll get hate mail and all that kind of thing. Whereas the personal offense that they took was all backed up with facts, with reports, with audio, with depositions. So I never made any accusation of any type, including to their internal affairs department, that wasn’t backed up. Their Internal Affairs Department – or whatever it’s called – never bothered to come down here and look at anything or review anything or delve into their leaks that we had pretty strong evidence of that they were leaking.”

\- Baldwin returns to the topic of his son’s term paper, which he admits he has not read.

\- Bob explains that he took offense to how Baldwin and Rozzi were being characterized online, and took the initiative to reach out to the defense team to offer support.

\- Baldwin mentions that he considers Bob a friend or colleague, and Ali, even though he does not know her as well.

\- Baldwin talks about how he is in awe of David Hennessy and connected with him for a few years, learning a great deal from him.

\- Baldwin reiterates that he talked to Bob as a friend and colleague interested in the craft of legal strategies.

\- He mentions that he believes people have the mistaken impression that the defense team listened to all these podcasts and wanted crazy conspiracy theories spewed out there. (He begins to jump around with a bunch of half sentences, but explains that he doesn’t know who any of the central figures are in social media, persons of interest, or podcasters from memory.

\- Baldwin states “Jerry Holeman was recently on a podcast that somebody told him about, and said that even during the trial we were violating the gag order and talking and revealing infor...that’s just a lie! That’s just not true. Was I talking to Bob Motta during the trial? And to Andrea Burkhart...and to Lawyer Lee and others that were friendly? Gosh I’m a human being who likes for people to like me to talk to them for a second and get some affirmation. Did that work? Did that not work? That’s not leaking information, that’s trying to be a better lawyer and friendly person.”

\- Ali begins to tell an anecdote about how Bob and Baldwin connected, but she’s incorrect; she was beginning the story of an incident involving David Hennessy speaking very loudly in court.

\- Baldwin recounts how he actually connected with Bob on Halloween, and he was told about Bob by his wife. His wife referred to him as “one of those guys” and then he shifts to say someone is calling Bob a shill for the defense, and that he would expect Bob to be pro-defense based on the little information he had about him. He then asks if he can tell a story about October 31^(st), and then goes on several tangents.

\- After being removed from the case, Baldwin was adamant about not being reinstated. Deeply distressed by the events that transpired, he believed his career was over, that Jerry Holeman had “won” because he went out and conducted an investigation into him. He claims that Holeman had a conflict of interest because Baldwin had been going after him. He alleges that Holeman deliberately targeted him for an investigation because he wanted him off the case. He says they will return to the issue of Holeman wanting Baldwin arrested and charged with a crime, and he classifies it as “third world banana republic stuff.”

\- He returns to recount the events leading up to October 31^(st), sharing that he received a call from Rozzi, inquiring about his intentions regarding the case. Baldwin explains that he declined any involvement, stating he lacked the emotional capacity to handle the case and believed his return would not benefit the client. Rozzi expressed his frustration and disgust, admonishing Baldwin not to let “them” get away with this and using strong language to criticize his hesitation. Although Baldwin eventually agreed with Rozzi’s sentiment, he remained hesitant. However, after receiving support and encouragement from Cara Wieneke, Mark Leeman, and many others, he found renewed determination to rejoin the case and fight for reinstatement as Richard Allen’s defense counsel.

\- They formulated a strategy to file in as the attorneys representing Richard Allen pro bono if Judge Gull would not allow them back on the case. Baldwin emphasizes that the partners in his law firm gave him latitude to devote all his attention to the case, and their support did not waver even when he indicated that they would be doing the work pro bono (which had a high potential to bankrupt the firm).

\- He finally discusses the day of 10/31/2023: The night before, Baldwin and Rozzi filed to be reinstated on the case pro bono. The other lawyers who were assigned by Judge Gull were waiting with them in the jury room. Richard Allen arrives, and they explain that per their previous conversation, they will try to get back on the case, and he introduces the new lawyers who will handle the case if they are unsuccessful at being reinstated. Judge Gull arrives and takes the bench, ignores them, and acknowledges the new attorneys.

\- Ali interrupts to clarify if Judge Gull deviated from procedure in announcing representation; Baldwin verified she did not.

\- Baldwin points out that they felt alienated and alone, and he becomes sentimental, complimenting Rozzi and his loyalty to him during the crime scene photo leak. He says he will love Brad Rozzi until the day he dies.

\- Bob points out he was in court with them on that day, and discloses that they had previously been exchanging text or email messages regarding strategies to be restored on the case.

\- Bob recounts the story of Judge Gull giving a speech in which she tears Baldwin and Rozzi a new asshole, and then tells Richard Allen that although she knows he has requested to retain the same counsel, she cannot in good conscience because they are grossly negligent and incompetent.

\- Baldwin laments that the reporting on the case has not reflected the type of investigative journalism that would challenge the official narratives that he thinks it warrants.

\- He pivots to discuss the Franks memo. He discusses skepticism that anyone criticizing could have actually read it, since it was so thoroughly documented and supported with abundant notations and references. He encourages any journalist to use the Franks memo as a roadmap, and to interview all of the names mentioned in the Franks memo.

\- Bob replies that Defense Diaries is fulfilling that role, and Ali points out that he means traditional journalists, not podcasters.

\- Bob goes on a tangent about the decay of the legacy media, points out that the vast majority of people consume their news from social media, and that the current platforms have a much bigger audience that traditional media outlets.

\- Bob asks how Baldwin was initially pulled into the case.

\- Baldwin explains he was working on many cases, the most important of which was an LWOP case (life without the possibility of parole).

\- He pauses the story to say that McLeland, Holeman, and all those guys would be shocked to know that he is very well-liked and respected all over the state. He emphasizes that he is saying that humbly, and he has practiced without issues over the last three decades.

\- The LWOP case resolved via an agreement with the prosecutors.

\- Rozzi cold-called Baldwin. Baldwin was familiar with him as the go-to lawyer with complex and high-profile case that required a tactician to navigate. Rozzi received his name from Stacey Uliana.

\- Baldwin points out that just today, Stacey Uliana was assigned to Richard Allen’s case as an appellate attorney.

\- Per Baldwin, once Uliana learned Judge Gull was on the case, she declined to participate. He stops suddenly mid-explanation as to why this was an issue for Uliana.

\- Baldwin confirms to Rozzi that he is available, and is informed that Judge Gull will contact him to vet him.

\- He states that he was already acquainted with Judge Gull’s daughter, who is a very good prosecutor. He takes a call from Judge Gull, and she approves adding him to the case.

\- Bob has a monologue about wanting to have the defense team featured in interviews on the channel to humanize the defense attorneys after attempts to destroy their reputations and question their integrity.

\- Ali asks for Baldwin’s first impression of Richard Allen when they finally met.  
\- Baldwin states that initially – before Allen was in solitary for so long – he was confused and asserting his innocence.

\- He states that initially, the defense team was treated well by the staff in Westville. He claims that John Galipeau (the former warden) told many lies, and points out an example regarding the lawyers having cell phones in the facility.

\- He pointed out that Allen was being kept in a completely separate building that was so far away, they had to be transported to the location via golf cart. He described the building as gross, the worst building he had seen in the IDOC system, he likened it to an old asylum and says it looks similar to the setting of a horror movie. They were shown into a captain’s office, and Allen was brought in “like Hannibal Lecter in chains.” Presumably this would be with the traditional belly chains with cuffs linked to them that restrict movement.

\- He states that Richard Allen was confused, and he believed whatever Allen asserted in that initial meeting.

\- Baldwin jumps forward to speak about the trial. He states that the courthouse guards were very nice and sweet, and professional in their interactions. He talks about having lunch in the courthouse basement with Allen throughout the trial. He points out that his client loves Taco Bell, and is a very funny guy. He then relates a story that Allen told him during one of those lunch breaks, about the first time they met. Apparently Baldwin came over and hugged Allen in the initial meeting, and that was the first human positive contact he had with anyone since his arrest.

\- He jumps back to speak about their initial meeting, and that he thought Allen was an innocent guy. Baldwin said he prepared himself for the possibility that he would learn his client committed the crime as he learned more information, but that he never saw any proof that he was responsible for the crimes.

\- Bob asks if Baldwin is aware of how Allen is faring post-sentencing. He says he does not have any information, and the last time he spoke to him was just after the sentencing hearing.

\- Baldwin expresses that he had initially planned to confront Holeman after the hearing regarding statements he made, but Auger took care of that. He stated that he had previous confrontations with Holeman but decided it was not appropriate, and Auger handled the situation more tactfully.

\- He instead followed Allen out, and wanted to point out that the theme of the sentencing had been to pressure Allen to not pursue appeals if he was genuine in his religious beliefs.

\- He states that Allen is a good human being, does not like that the families do not have closure, and, even as an innocent person, he is upset by the crime scene photographs.

\- At the end of the sentencing hearing, Allen had been asked by Judge Gull if he would like to pursue an appeal, and Baldwin thought that he might not answer in the affirmative.

\- Ali interrupts and speculates that Judge Gull attempted to use the pressure of the hearing to manipulate Allen into declining an appeal. Baldwin deflected.

\- Baldwin points out that Allen’s post-sentencing experience differs from all other convicted defendants. Rather than being picked up at the convenience of prison transportation, he was transported to the Regional Diagnostic Center (where classification of incoming inmates occurs,) the same day. Typically, inmates are processed in 3-4 weeks before being assigned a location, but six days later, the process was complete and Allen was already back in Westville.

\- Baldwin points out that there are other IDOC facilities with more robust mental health services, and he cannot believe that he was placed back in Westville. He classifies that decision as weird, sad, disturbing, and horrible, and insists Allen should’ve been placed in a facility where he does not have bad memories.

\- Bob replies that there is a large volume of psychological warfare on inmates, and that no one can look at this case objectively and think there’s anything less than a vested interest to quickly redirect public attention. He feigns concern for the victims’ family, and speculates that they will be panicked and not updated about the process by McLeland.

\- Bob asks how often a pretrial detainee is kept in a prison in Indiana. Baldwin says this case is the first time it has happened in his time practicing law. He was given a statistic that seven other pretrial detainees were in the IDOC system, but they were extremely disruptive or problematic in the jail, and were moved into IDOC because they posed a danger to themselves and others.

\- He states that Allen’s case is unique, in that he was sent directly to the prison without a lawyer, without a hearing, and without any evidence being shown to prove he deserved to be housed there.

\- He points out that Max Baker did excellent work in reviewing and preparing the presentation of Allen’s incarceration videos, and he is glad he did not have to personally view them, as he found them too upsetting when he briefly watched.

\- Bob compliments Rozzi on his work to shine a light on conditions of confinement and were so far outside the norm.

\- Baldwin acknowledges that he appreciates good lawyering, and remarks that he approached Deaner to compliment her on her work during the admissibility of the “so-called confessions” during pretrial hearing on July 30^(th). He indicates he commended Luttrell a couple of times during the trial for quality work. He alludes to a conversation with McLeland on his cross of Dawn Perlmutter during the pre-trial hearings, where he complimented him, but also says that McLeland stepped into a trap that he doesn’t know about.

\- Bob asks about a bond hearing that he attended in February.

\- Bob asks about a bond hearing Baldwin attended in February. Baldwin explains that murder was not bondable in Indiana before changes were made a few years ago. Now, a bond hearing is like a mini-trial where the state must prove they have a strong case against the accused.  
\- Baldwin mentions that until September 2023, they didn't have access to key elements of discovery, such as Libby’s phone and Todd Click’s documentation. He knew about the ""Odinism stuff"" starting in March 2023 from a 12-page report by Murphy. They reviewed 3.5 million pieces of evidence (paper, photos, video, and audio files) that were received in September 2023, making Baldwin think they should have insisted on the bond hearing in February 2023. He believes the prosecution wouldn’t have been ready, and they could have used that opportunity to lock them into a narrative. In retrospect, he agrees with David Hennessy, who advised going ahead with the hearing.

\- Bob transitions by saying, “speaking of the Devil,” and asks Baldwin about developing the Franks memo, speculating about why it was drafted. Baldwin rejects Bob’s theory and explains that he initially filed a generic motion to suppress. He preferred this approach because specific motions indicate to law enforcement that they need to investigate further. At first, Baldwin believed the PCA wasn’t strong enough for charges and filed based on that, but it was unsuccessful.

\- Baldwin gently rejects his theory. Initially, Baldwin filed a generic motion to suppress. He cites that specific motions to suppress indicate to LE that there is something they need to rectify or investigate further and it helps them solve the case, so he leans towards a more generic document. Initially, he thought that the PCA was not enough to warrant charges, and filed on that alone but was not successful.

\- After reviewing statements by Betsy Blair and Sarah Carbaugh, he felt that the prosecution failed to convey the complete story to Judge Diener. He contacted McLeland to inform him that he would be pursuing Liggett because he believes that information should have been included. Baldwin was informed by his interns that he might need to file a Franks memo, but he insisted that a motion to suppress should be sufficient.

\- McLeland informed him that he was going to ask for a continuance, and was informed that it needed to be filed as a Franks memo, and that was verified with the judge. Baldwin acknowledges that he had never had to prepare one before, but he was happy to oblige since his original motion to suppress was filed generically.

\- Regarding the contents of the Franks memo, Rozzi and Baldwin battled over the scope of it. Baldwin said he believed he was going to win based on the Franks memo alone. He thinks it will be an appellate issue that the Franks memo should have at a minimum warranted a hearing, but that it also should’ve been ruled on and granted.

\- He says that the process developed organically. He traveled down to Georgia with his colleagues, and when they returned they conducted depositions. Jerry Holeman was deposed, and that entire week he felt exposed some deliberate omissions by LE. He then examined the discovery looking specifically for information related to that narrative, and found several POIs and evidence of their involvement. As he continued to sift through the discovery, he had to keep adding to the Franks memo as he found more information that “which had not been given.” (From the notetaker – I believe what he is conveying is that they were given this information, since he was obviously examining it, but it was not highlighted as pertinent or significant to the case.)

\- He raises the concern about the mimicked crime scene photo on Brad Holder’s Facebook page. He does not name Holder but says the name is included in the memo. In March 2023, he found a report from Ryan Winters where a sleuth from Georgia called to point out the photo and other details about Holder that seemed suspicious. Baldwin indicates that there were many reports about both the photo and Holder’s activities. But Winters was one of a handful of investigators who had seen the crime scene, and saw parallels between the crime scene and photos.

\- Baldwin indicates that he wanted to reach out to McLeland to find where the photo was located in discovery, but he did not feel he could trust them. The person in Georgia that had possession of the photo was Ryan Boucher, and he was reluctant to forward or hand over his information remotely, so part of the team traveled down to meet with him.

\- Baldwin first viewed the image while in Georgia, and was shocked at the parallels to the crime scene: two girls on a forest floor, mimicking death, and with branches covering them. He also was concerned that Holder was acquainted with Abby. They collected that photo from Boucher and traveled back to Indiana.

\- They held onto the photo and only revealed they were in possession of it during Holeman’s deposition on August 10^(th). He claims that he and Rozzi “played dumb” about Holder being a POI, Odinism, and runes. They asked Holeman about all of these subjects, and he asserted that had been forthcoming in that week, that they would’ve volunteered the information that they were aware of Holder, had thoroughly investigated him, and the reasons why he was cleared.

\- During the first part of Holeman’s deposition, Baldwin handed a copy of Murphy’s Odinism report which Holeman then read. He claimed to not be familiar with the document and questioned its origin. Baldwin then showed him the mimicked crime scene photo they had collected, and Holeman was again dismissive.

\- Baldwin pauses to explain that he did not plan to do any media because he was severely emotionally impacted by the trial, and just wanted the process to continue. However, after watching the post-sentencing LE press conference, comments made by Jerry Holeman and Doug Carter compelled him to grant this interview. He alluded to other media appearances that are planned.

\- Baldwin returns to the August 10 deposition of Jerry Holeman he gave him the document from Trooper Murphy, and asked him to take it with him to investigate. After the deposition ended, Holeman left and encountered Murphy who was waiting to be deposed.

\- In his deposition Murphy says that he was approached by Holeman, showed him the document, and asked “how the fuck did they get this?” Baldwin overheard the commotion.

\- Ali suggested that Holeman was already aware of the existence of the document, and that LE was trying to keep it from the defense. Baldwin agrees that was what it looked like and sounded like to him.

\- Ryan Winters in his report indicates that he approached Holeman at some point to show him the mimicked photo, and insisted that Holder be re-investigated and re-interviewed but it was never done.

\- Baldwin then explains that the mimicked crime scene photo is then \*poof\* gone. (Indicating that it was deleted from Holder’s Facebook page). He characterizes the photo as an exculpatory evidence, and says that it does not exist anywhere else other than the copy they physically retrieved from Boucher on their trip to Georgia.

\- Trooper Roland Purdy previously testified twice during the deposition phase that he saw the photos on Holder’s social media, but he did not think it was of any value. A couple of days later when he was recalled for testimony by the Prosecution, Baldwin recounts that Purdy changed his testimony and said his recollection was mistaken about the photo.

\- Ali expresses frustration that a judge would allow Purdy to be recalled to update his testimony.

\- Baldwin points out that the photo is missing, that recordings of interviews with third-party suspects are also missing, and he sees a common theme.

\- He argues that the theme is that all of the photos, interview recordings, and everything that he tied into the Franks memo were the pieces of evidence that disappeared.

\- Ali asks if Baldwin would be permitted to distribute them since they are part of the exhibit record, Bob suggests that the documents already uploaded on a specific subreddit. Ali receives a message indicating that he is mistaken.

\- Baldwin tried in the Franks memo to describe visual elements, an example being a Goodfellas meme about your best friends helping you move bodies a few days after the murders.

\- Per Baldwin, “from their own Pat Cicero...I mean…there...it could easily be argued that they needed to move - two people to move those bodies for that for them to be positioned the way that they were and the way that the blood. And if you get into the forensic photo data...there...you know it could have...those bodies...the phone...you know, the phone could have um uh at 4:33 a.m. it could’ve been in somebody’s outbuilding, it could’ve been in somebody’s house in and around where they ultimately were. It connects with the tower at 4:33 a.m., they take it out of a feral bag (I think he misspoke, and meant Faraday bag), they take it out of a refrigerator, or it just - they just walk it a couple of steps it doesn’t record on the Apple Health Data. And then it um and then the phone um connects with the tower and then all that activity causes it to die very quickly. That’s probably exactly what happened.”

\- He states he believes Stacy Eldridge confirms that the above-listed quote is probably what happened.

\- He compliments Chris Cecil, characterizes him as an honorable guy, and he loves that. He implies he has admiration for that any cop that is honest – listing Kevin Murphy, Todd Click, and (Greg) Ferency as other examples of honest cops.

\- Ali asks a question about the brand of phone case on Libby’s phone, as based on her research it can cause the iPhone to register an inaccurate audio output state. She speculates that the phantom headphone detection could be from the girls crossing some body of water at 5:33 p.m. and deliberately protecting the phone but she cuts herself off after acknowledging she does not know how to explain how it was then unplugged.

\- Baldwin acknowledges that one aspect of the case that they definitely could’ve shown improvement with was disputing the State’s timeline.

\- He does not want to broach the subject of strategy because he hopes to be on this trial next time.

\- The Prosecution made a big deal out of the fact that the phone did not move until discovered by investigators. Baldwin characterizes this as conjecture, stating that the phone would not show if it remained in a car, or if it is in one place for a long stretch of time until the battery dies at 4:33 a.m. He states once the battery is dead you can pick up the phone, go across the river, and place the phone underneath Abby’s body and it will not register any movement.

\- Baldwin asserts that he does not believe that Libby’s phone was at the crime scene at 4:33 a.m., he believes it was in a different location. He said that the evidence supports this assertion, and the Apple health app corroborates the claim.

\- Ali asks if a jammer could’ve been in use, Bob suggests a Faraday bag, and Baldwin says all of those things could’ve been used to explain the findings from Libby’s phone.

\- He claims that the Prosecution’s theory that the phone was under “that body” (Abby) has been debunked, but does not elaborate.

\- He states that he doesn’t at all believe that “those bodies” were there on the 13^(th.)

\- Baldwin is even more vehement that the crime could not have been committed by a single perpetrator, and certainly not have happened in the middle of the day without anyone hearing the crime.

\- He states that the evidence and common sense do not support the single perpetrator in daylight hours theory.

\- He postulates that the offenders were nearby, saw the phone die, and moved the bodies into place, or the murders occurred after 4:33 a.m.

\- He explains that the defense did a poor job of explaining how the evidence supports the above-listed scenario, and upon reflection they could’ve communicated that better throughout the trial with their cross-examinations.

\- Bob asks about Darrell Sterrett’s trial testimony where he did not recall the lighting conditions, but was interviewed on the first episode of the Down the Hill Podcast where he was interviewed and spoke about the nighttime search and lighting conditions.

\- Baldwin acknowledges that one of the deficiencies in their case was that the Defense did not listen to podcasts where trial witnesses were previously interviewed so that they could recognize discrepancies.

\- Baldwin says that he repeatedly failed to relate the Defense’s story through cross-examination.

\- He highlights that Sterrett’s podcast interview revealed that the clothing found in the creek was not there overnight, and therefore the victims’ bodies were also not there.

\- Ali references an aspect of the prior interview with Jennifer Auger, where they suggest a new field in the legal profession to help defense attorneys collate data from social media.

\- Baldwin acknowledges that if you have sent him an email and he has not responded, it is because he did not have a chance to look or he briefly examined it in order to triage his messages.

\- He begins to address the internet sleuths, but then directs his comment to those who believe the defense worked with internet sleuths. He denies that they used sleuths to disseminate evidence to bypass the gag order.

\- He characterizes the web sleuths as a symbiotic relationship that he maintained because they provided some helpful information, and he was unable to give them any information due to the gag order.

\- Baldwin indicates that he is unsure if talking to certain individuals was a violation of the gag order in the case.

\- He insists that they should have fought the gag order, as it was too broad to be practical.

\- He speaks about the March 18, 2024 contempt hearing, where his team provided strong evidence that the State was leaking evidence.

\- He argues that LE and the Prosecution were only investigating the Defense because they wanted them off the case.

\- He contends that LE will not investigate accusations of misconduct in their own ranks even when solid evidence is presented showing unprofessional collaboration.

\- He claims to have seen emails from players on the State’s side and podcasters with instructions to erase everything because basically they have been found out.

\- He addresses Doug Carter directly to say that he can have his weird press conference – which Baldwin has only seen bits and pieces of – and say that he’d like to confront him, but Baldwin is unimpressed with him. He would be impressed by Doug Carter scrutinizing the evidence, asking solid questions, and investigating accusations of leaks by LE as vigilantly as they did the Defense crime scene photo leak.

\- Baldwin states that if journalists would interview subordinates of Holeman and Carter because he knows that those under their command are also unimpressed.

\- He claims that Holeman and Carter think that everybody worships them and thinks they’re awesome, but that there is a disconnect between how they are actually perceived by people who know them.

\- He says he will share an anecdote about Jerry Holeman to illustrate who he is as a person.

\- He stops, and directs a comment to Holeman that he would not be on DD were it not for the fact that Holeman is already out there on podcasts spreading his narrative.

\- He gives background information for context about the anecdote:

\- Baldwin instructed Allen during jury selection and for the trial that the jury will be watching him. He specifically warned him that when crime scene photos are being displayed, the jury will watch his reaction to them. Since the photos can be upsetting to anybody, he advised him that when the photos are up, view each of the four quadrants of the photo and make a list of items seen in the photo to shift focus away from whatever visceral reaction he has.

\- He also instructed Allen that during graphic testimony, to write down word-for-word what is being said to shift focus away from the emotion behind that testimony.

\- Baldwin returns to the anecdote, to explain that Jerry Holeman was seated directly next to Allen and was craning over to read his notes because he is a bully.

\- He points out that Holeman’s true character is the angry and verbally abusive man seen at the end of Allen’s 10/26/22 interview.

\- Defense investigator Matt Hoffman notices Holeman is reading Allen’s notes, points it out Baldwin, who asks Allen to lean back so that he can look directly at Holeman. Baldwin pointed at Holeman and instructed him to stop reading Allen’s notes.

\- He says that Holeman was shocked when confronted about reading the notes, since he is used to deferential treatment.

\- He relates that Holeman he tried to speak to him during the next break, he stated that his vision is poor and he was not able to read anything Allen had written.

\- Baldwin told Holeman to get out of his face, and return to his seat.

\- Baldwin asserts that this confrontation is why Holeman does not like him, because he does not put up with his bullying.

\- He explains that he is not confrontational, and is otherwise a wimp, but he has no respect for Holeman and it is easy to be confrontational with him because of that.

\- Ali asks for Baldwin to tell about what Jerry Holeman and LE did to him personally, and also asks if the police harassed any defense witnesses or people named in the Franks memo.

\- He states that Jerry Holeman tried to have Baldwin arrested and charged with a crime.

\- Ali asks Baldwin to elaborate.

\- Baldwin says that the crime scene photo leak that happened was awful and terrible.

\- He states that when he became aware of it, he immediately reached out to the courts.

\- He says that the next day Holeman contacted him via phone, and informed him that he was assigned to investigate the leak.

\- Baldwin questioned why Holeman was investigating that allegation.

\- He claims that Holeman had open disdain for him because they were attacking his case, and that amounted to a conflict of interest.

\- He says that he told Holeman that he knew he was going to use this opportunity to have Baldwin kicked off the case.  
\- Baldwin states that typically when he has to cooperate with a police investigation an officer comes to his office to collect a statement from him.

\- Baldwin felt that Holeman abused his authority to seize control of the investigation, rather than let the responsibility go to another State Police employee.

\- Holeman contacted the Johnson County, Indiana Prosecutor Lance Hamner to request that charges be filed against Baldwin.

\- Baldwin speaks directly to Holeman and states that he is very well liked, and that he is well-respected, and that he would be surprised to know how well he is regarded.

\- Hamner’s secretary immediately reached out to ask Baldwin who Holeman is and ask what he is doing.

\- He states that Holeman was aware that Baldwin had not committed a crime.

\- He hints at a friend of his committed wrongdoing, but Baldwin complains that he was the one treated as though he was a criminal.

\- He characterizes Holeman’s attempt to have him arrested as real “third world Banana Republic type stuff.”

\- Baldwin goes on to explain that there are three counties in Indiana where he is not well-regarded, and in all three that is because the Prosecutors in those counties let the police run all over them.

\- Additionally, when the police do anything bad - or are dishonest - or skirt the edges, those Prosecutors in those respective counties overlook it and blame the Defense.

\- He felt he because he did not put up with the abuse of authority by the Prosecutors and police he was named. Public enemy Number One.

\- He speaks to Doug Carter, to inform him that “your guy tried to arrest me for nonexistent charges, and that’s the guy you promoted.

\- Baldwin indicates that he wanted to believe that Doug Carter had integrity and would look into his complaints, but he was instead directed to ISP’s Internal Affairs.

\- Baldwin met with Internal Affairs, who were cordial and interviewed him, and he never heard from anyone regarding his complaints again.

\- He says that Holeman did not allow local police to arrest Mitch Westerman. He personally came down to arrest Westerman, and brought every LE officer he could find to do so, which is uncharacteristic for a misdemeanor arrest.

\- He says that Holeman’s attempt to amplify his power is super scary, he’s nervous talking about it, and he doesn’t know what “they” are going to do.

\- He has prayed about it, and concluded that he has to have the courage to talk candidly about his negative experiences.

\- Bob asks him to address rumors from pro-Prosecution commentators, that allege that the Defense purposefully leaked the crime scene photos in order to corroborate the Franks memo.

\- Baldwin characterizes this accusation as outrageous.

\- Baldwin’s staff watched all media interviews after the gag order was lifted, and saw Holeman offer the opinion that he believed the leak was deliberate.

\- Baldwin said there would have been no benefit to such a leak, it could potentially derail the whole case, and that on a human level he would never want that done.

\- He communicates that he finds the idea of the leak upsetting, that he has cried extensively about it.

\- He states that his friend Mitch made a tragic error.

\- He addresses a rumor that Mitch was working with the Prosecution, which he dismisses as untrue.

\- He explains that Mitch had a friend who believed in Allen’s guilt. He claims that Mitch took pictures of the crime scene photos in an attempt to convince his friend of Allen’s innocence, and that friend betrayed him.

\- He says he does not blame “him” for trusting his friend, but that this leak is Westerman’s fault.

\- Baldwin says that he was treated like a criminal, when in fact he was the victim, but he also is not sure a crime occurred so he’s not sure if that’s the appropriate way to classify his status.

\- He states that Westerman’s actions were wrong, ridiculous, infuriating, and super upsetting.

\- He relates that Westerman’s life is ruined in a lot of ways because of this incident.

\- Baldwin has forgiven Westerman, since he knows it was a devastating mistake on his part.

\- He knows that Westerman regrets it immensely, has lost his job, and alludes to other difficulties.

\- Baldwin explains that he was angry for a long time, but now he feels awful for Westerman as he has faced consequences for his actions.

\- He again denies that the leak was intentional, and denies any prior knowledge about the leak.

\- He said that it was despicable and defamatory for Doug Carter to say that Baldwin was in any way responsible for the suicide that occurred following the discovery of the leak.

For now, I’m mainly focusing on how these elements present themselves in the cup, as that feels like a good starting point.​ I’d love any suggestions on what else I should pay attention to during tastings!

  
**1.** [**Fazenda Rio Brilhante – Brazil**](https://lightupcoffee.com/en/products/fazenda-rio-brilhante-brazil)

* Region: Coromandel, Cerrado Miniero
* Producer: Inacio Urban
* Farm: Fazenda Rio Brilhante
* Altitude: 950–1,100m
* Processing: Natural
* Variety: Arara

**Observations:**

* **Aroma:** Very subtle, which surprised me since it’s naturally processed—I was expecting a stronger fruity aroma. Maybe it’s more developed, which might explain the muted scent.
* **Taste:** Clean cup with medium acidity, no bitterness, and no unpleasant flavors like burnt notes or overly strong acidity. It didn’t disappoint—very delicious, even after cooling! I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to brew another cup right after finishing the first one.
* This was my first time trying the Arara variety, and I’ll definitely keep an eye out for it in the future \^\_\^

**Overall Rating:** 4/5

​2. [**Las Colinas – Costa Rica**](https://lightupcoffee.com/en/products/las-colinas-catuai-costa-rica)

* Region: Tarrazu
* Producer: Ricardo Hernandez, Elsa Sánchez
* Altitude: 1,700–1,800m
* Processing: Honey
* Variety: Catuai

**Observations:**

* **Aroma:** ​This one had a stronger aroma—kind of nutty.
* **Taste:** ​ Mild acidity with a nutty aftertaste. Slight bitterness emerged as the cup cooled. I suspect it’s roasted slightly lighter than the Brazil coffee since it was harder to grind, but I was surprised that it had more bitterness despite that.

**Overall Rating:** 3/5

So today is day 11 for me without alcohol. (40m) I have drank heavily since I was 14 and done a few stop starts over the years. I think 5 weeks was my longest streak a few years ago but then I started again. I have had serious financial pressures over the last 18 months and drinking has been my way of hiding away from it. Mornings in Wetherspoons, home for a couple of hours sleep, then back in the pub. This was my daily routine for the last 7 months. I literally couldn’t sit in the house unless I was full of alcohol because my anxiety was too much to handle. I was making any excuse to sneak out and squeeze another drink in (while driving) I would sleep for a few hours at night and promise myself that I would not drink that following day. My HR 1 night while lying in bed reached 150 and I thought I was having a heart attack so went to A+E. was all down to drink (poison) anxiety and stress.

Anyway the good points now after 10 days!

Days 1&2 very difficult (cold turkey) self medicating with a Valium at night. Still only managed 2 hours max both nights.  Horrendous anxiety. 

Days 3&4 pretty similar to the above but the anxiety was starting to subside slightly 

Days 5&6 managed to go for a hike (literally impossible for me 2 weeks ago due to my mind set) I managed to attend an online job interview with a good salary. Managing a few more hours sleep without the Valium.

Day 7&8 met up with friends in the pub and drank decaf coffee and AF Heineken and I wasn’t actually craving a pint! This was surprising to me. My wife and I cooked tea together (we haven’t done this for as long as I can remember because I just couldn’t physically face it) anxiety levels dropped significantly even though I still have all the financial pressure. I now feel I can face them head on and come out of the other side better off for it!)

Day 9&10 Had 2nd interview and got the job which I start next Monday😃I managed 8 hours sleep last night with no crazy vivid dreams or palpitations. I still have slight anxiety but now I feel like I can cope. 

Honestly 2 weeks ago I did not think this would be possible for me but I knew it had to stop. The first couple of days are a white knuckle ride and there is no escaping that. Although your GP can probably give you advice if you decide to stop. I just knew I had to do it right when I did and waiting to get in with a doctor would give me an excuse to drink for a few more days!

Sorry for waffling but if this gives 1 person some hope then it’s worth it. Trust me if I can do it then you can. No matter what the demons in your head are telling you! Tell them to fuck right off. Shout it if you have to. I did a couple of times!

This sub has been a god send for me because I can relate to so many stories and it gives me hope that i am not some sort of freak. I just have an illness and that’s it.

I tend to go to a co-working space a couple days a week for 4-8 hours a time and I would like some more screen real estate and better ergonomics. I am posting this to share my findings and gather feedback.

# What I Want

* I have a 16” macbook Pro (work issued)
   * So my screen is big enough for most of my needs
   * I can’t install custom drivers 
* I want my main monitor to be my best monitor and I want it to be at eye level
   * I don’t want to have to look down
* I like the idea of a simpler solution for a shorter coffee shop stint, so modularity is nice but not necessary
* I want the monitor(s) close to each other (no big gaps in between)
* I need to be able to quickly unplug my laptop to take it to a meeting space

Options I have tried

* Tri-screen monitors 
* Dual screen, vertical monitors
* Single, larger monitor
* Just my laptop

# Just My Laptop

This is what I use the most.

Here I use a [folding monitor stand made by Moft](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B089GQKDNH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1). It is lightweight and puts the laptop at the right height for me. This means I also have to use a separate mouse and keyboard, but I am okay with that.

# Dual Screen, Vertical

**Worked well in a coffee shop. Screen quality is generally lower. Cords were annoying.**

For the tri-screen monitor, I initially ordered a [15.6”, dual screen from Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0CXSSWP7W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1). 

This worked well in a coffee shop. I would use my laptop screen as the bottom half (basically cover the lower screen). This seems wasteful, but it let me have a second screen above. I didn’t even need to plug in the lower screen. It was a compact solution that worked well for that scenario, as I could use the laptop keyboard and trackpad.

For the office (where I am staying longer and have more space), it wasn’t as good. The screen quality is notably worse than my laptop, so I tended to look down at the lower one. Also, the top screen wasn’t quite high enough. I tried using a larger screen (18” screen from uperfect). This gave me the height I wanted but I had to plug in too many cords. The device needs its own, dedicated power to get a brightness above 60%. I also had to use a mini hdmi cord for each screen and plug my own laptop in as well. If I am going to a coffee shop, then I care less, as I only plug in 1 screen and dont stay for more than 1-2 hours. In the office, this is more annoying. Lastly, the screens seemed to flicker on and off, which was frustrating.

**Takeaway**: a large screen (16” +, higher quality (2k, 400 nits+) solution would work well here, especially if I could use only 1 cord for the visual (I am fine plugging in separately for power if needs be). Maybe the [Jsaux Flipgo](https://jsaux.com/?sca_ref=6665465.WXw3AI8vmc&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAp4O8BhAkEiwAqv2UqFsHXF-FEIn96btGQ8MFeTWv45lBMKlaRG_xyoE17pxKPu8acjET5xoCcOQQAvD_BwE)?

# Tri-Screen

I haven’t actually tried this variant. The issue is that tri-screen monitors generally require a kickstand. That means I cant use the Moft laptop stand (its top isn’t big enough) and would have to put the whole thing on the table. That’s okay for a coffee shop, but doesn’t work for the office setting (for me).

What I have tried is the [Duet Max Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Duex-Portable-Monitor-Extender-Compatible/dp/B09V27M95D?th=1). Its a 14” monitor that attaches to the back of your laptop and slides out. This lets me get a second screen that is attached to my laptop but still allows me to use the laptop stand. This is what I have been using lately.

It’s…okay. The issue is that, because it slides out from the back, the screen ends up being set back from your laptop, which is a little annoying. It’s also a bit too small.

# Single, Larger Monitor

Here I either keep my laptop closed, or I position it below the monitor, which is on the stand. Of all the solutions, this gives the most screen real estate. It’s not bad BUT: 

* I have to use the laptop on the bottom, otherwise it’s set too far back; 
* The monitor on the top ends up being leaned back a bit, rather than perpendicular to the ground. It’s a bit annoying but you get used to it. 
* The laptop on the bottom on the bottom isn;t quite high enough (too big of a gap between screens. I could prop it up but that is one more thing to pack

# What I am Still Thinking About

Trying a [portable, VESA mount stand](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0D2YBQKQ3/?coliid=I39XWKR4P5M4MP&colid=C6IHX4375ZSM&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it). Then using a single larger monitor above, with my laptop below. This lets me set whatever height I want, keep it perpendicular to the ground, and set it further back.

BUT, setting up the stand seems fairly annoying.

I have been trying to find the perfect travel set up for work. I tend to go to a coworking space a couple days a week for 4-8 hours a time and I would like some more screen real estate and better ergonomics. I am posting this to share my findings and gather feedback.

Genuinely started today and will be tracking the process year on year. 

I have spend the last 8 years relying on state support after a brain injury. I don’t have a lot coming in, but I still see the opportunity with XRP and want to seize the moment with what I can feasibly do. 

Today I bought 2 XRP to add to my bag. Yes 2.

But it’s about the habit, the sense of pride in choosing to invest in my future rather than paying for the bus and walking instead/ getting a coffee out. 

Had I done this when BTC came out I’d be typing this from my eco-friendly cabin in the Alps, rather than my studio rental flat. No bad feelings though, just the decision to learn from the past and make better choices.

I’m not saying XRP will be the next Bitcoin, but why not build towards a future of possibility? Worst case scenario- I become better at saving, investing and more disciplined with my money which will help me build my life back up.

I wish we’d been taught about investing as kids but now in my thirties I figure it’s never too late.

Is there something other than fat content that makes half and half special? Am I missing something? Surely this is just marketing gimmicks, right?",1,1736518521.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,1.0,False

My Wife and I are looking to open up a small Coffee shop in Koh Samui. She is Thai and I am from England. I would like to actually be able to work in the shop and understand I need a work permit to do this. 

I was wondering if anyone had advice on the best way to do this? From what I understand you need 4 Thai employees per foreign work permit, though i'm not sure our store will be big enough to need 4 employees, at least to start with anyway. 

  
Also what else should I expect when opening up a shop regarding legalities, taxes, etc. 

If there's any useful links you can provide please send them through. 

  
Appreciate any help and advice.

Thanks.",0,1736518455.0,kohsamui,2,0.5,False

I'm a female, 23 years old, around 55kg, 160cm from Argentina. In terms of ethnicity, I'm a mix between arabians, portuguese and native Americans. Edit: my only previous condition is polycystic ovary syndrome.

On Sunday, I started without being able to breathe well and with a heavy headache. The next day, that stopped, but I had pain from the middle to the lower part of the stomach that was very intense. Also, I have a very intense pain in my lower back. I can't even wear shorts, I just wear dresses because any pressure it's too much in that area.

The pain never left. It's still there, and now it's friday and I'm worried. Yesterday, I went to the guard. They performed some blood tests and a abdominal ultrasound, where it said that I had reactive-appearing lymph nodes with diffuse increased echogenicity of the adjacent mesenteric fat. Nothing else seemed wrong there. In the blood test, the white blood cells where a little bit high.

I didn't have a fever, and I'm as hungry as always. They told me to eat lightweight, but I still have a good appetite and before being at the doctor, I ate as always (things like coffee and milk) and nothing happened, but the pain was always there, no matter if I eat or not.

I never experienced something like this. When the doctor applied pressure, the worst places where the lower the right side under the abdomen and in the navel.

They told me to just take Paracetamol 1mg every 8 hours and to just wait 2 more days. If it doesn't go away, I should go again.

Are swollen glands in the appendix area supoussed to give me so much pain? Do you think this was an accurate diagnosis?

Thank you so much for any help you can provide.",1,1736518425.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False
1hy59q0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hy59q0/cant_fix_spray/,Can’t fix spray,"I’m getting spray only on some shots. I can’t determine if it’s just a product of using a bottomless portafilter, or if I’m doing something wrong. I’m using a Bambino plus, Encore ESP, Crema bottomless portafilter, Normcore tamp, and WDT on every shot. At an 18 on my grinder I’m getting 38-40 grams of espresso out from 18 grams of coffee in, and that’s in 30 seconds. Taste is right where I want it to be.

Just this morning my first shot pulled perfectly, but the second shot (immediately after) had one little spray. Then the third shot about five minutes later sprayed all over the place. I’m doing the exact same pick prep every time, so I can’t figure out why some are spraying (whether a little or a lot) and some are not spraying at all.

Do I just need to switch to spouted, or can I do something better?",2,1736518398.0,espresso,7,1.0,False
