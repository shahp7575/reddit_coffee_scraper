\- No cheating on foods for a while. Didnt eat pizza, hamburger, or anything with more than 1000 carories for lunch and dinner.

Some background, I’ve been dealing with BB for a long time. Not room-filling but enough to be always thinking about it and self conscious in relationships, the workplace, tight quarters, etc.. my first recollection was at age 10 or 11. My dad was helping me with homework and made a comment of how bad it was. Another instance at 12 with a close friend playing computer games. At a young age I started only breathing through my nose and would never mouth breathe, not even when I slept. (Fast forward to this year taking the bristle test and finding the bacteria was primarily anaerobic (ie, thrive without oxygen)...was not helping myself.

I’ve been offered lots of mints over the years. People have even said, “did someone fart?” while near me and I know it’s my breath. The wrist lick test would smell like feces. Just sucks. So debilitating and embarrassing. Anyway, I’ve continued to try things for the last 12 years but it was all temporary. I remember chlorophyll supplements helping a lot but then gave me intense chest pain after a couple months. Same goes for molybendum, etc.. I will also mention that I often had an acidic taste in my mouth.

So onto the fix. Two primary things helped me…thanks to the Reddit crew here bc both originated from this community :)

1) I was on a plane one day feeling so down about my BB and was in the depths of Reddit. Someone mentioned breathing into the back of your throat to eliminate the anaerobic bacteria. With nothing to lose, on the 4 hour flight as I was semi-trying to sleep, I kept experimenting and trying to direct my breath in through my nose and into the back of my throat. I was stunned that after a light on and off nap of breathing that way, i had no acidic taste and the wrist test was completely neutral. This was encouraging for me but breathing like this was not initially natural. Took a lot of mindfulness and I would practice every night when going to bed. It was hardest during the day when I was focused on working or other things, but slowly it has now become mostly my default. If you struggle with the anaerobic bacteria or have also tried keeping your mouth shut most of your life, give this a try. 

2) I stumbled upon the Reddit thread by FredGarvinThePimp who was inspired by Napoleon7. I had heard of the Castile soap method but finally decided to give it a try. I have adopted their method with just a little variation. Here is my routine:
- to make the ‘tooth paste’ i mix 1 Tbsp of baking soda, 1/2 tsp of dr bronner’s castile soap (unsecented baby) and 1/2 tsp water and mix to a paste. I’ll then store in little containers for easy access during the week. 
- in the mornings I will do a pea sized amount on a wet tooth brush and brush. Also make sure you brush your tongue. 
- next, tongue scraper 
- lastly, 1/2 cap of mouth wash + 1 tbsp of sunflower oil or safflower oil (neutral oils), + 8-10 drops of eucalyptus essential oil, 4-5 drops of frankincense essential oil, and 3-4 drops of peppermint essential oil. Mix mix mix. Swish half of the mixture for 30 seconds in the whole mouth. Gargle the remaining for 30 seconds.

And that’s it. I usually do it in the mornings and in the evening before an event or dinner if I’m going to be socializing. I only do it twice a day. When I come back after dinner I’ll usually just do regular tooth paste. If I have an afternoon coffee I do feel like the acidity brings back my BB so I’ve been avoiding that.

This has helped me sooo much. It has combatted the acidity and paired with the breathing I feel mostly normal. I had a work event recently and a colleague was talking close to me and then came closer to show me something on their phone. No reaction at all. So grateful. I hope this helps someone. Hang in there and keep trying things!

Dating this chick for 5 months - official for 2, she has lots of male friends from her job and from run club who she would meet up with for coffee, made it official after 5 months and laid out my boundaries of no male friends or girls holidays- which she agreed to and respected.

She had what I believe to be super high interest:

Asked me what exercises she should do at the gym, Asked me what colour to get her nails, Asked me what she should eat, Super easy to deal with, very agreeable, Told me I make her feel calm and protected, Spent a ton of money on me for my birthday, organised a meal, an activity and baked me a cake, Came to surgery appointments and dropped me home afterwards, The sex is great - no complaints, Constantly wanting to see me

The past few weeks I've treated her like crap, didn't ask her how her day is/was and telling her that I didn't care either, forgot her doctors appointments for female problems, walked away from arguements without resolving them and blanking her calls/texts...I've really neglected the relationship 

Since breaking up multiple times over me being trivial, she has told me she needs and wants these things from her partner.

I emotionally and impulsively told her I can't give her what you need/want and dumped her and walked away (childish and emotional I know). Then I immediately regretted it and blew up her phone to the point of harrasing her and chased asking for her back, she  was distraught and wouldn't speak to me for a few days, she has given me another chance to prove that I can change and take an interest in her life....but is now demanding ""I gave up lots for you and you treated me like absolute crap, if we get back together I want to be able to go away with my friends and go for hikes with my male friend (60 year old m, grey, fat, married man, she hangs around with this guys adult kids and wife at the family home)...
Her friends and mum hate me but she is willing to give me a chance if I can change how I treat her..


I've partly agreed to her going for hikes with this male friend and girls holidays as I've had insecurities and traumatic relationships in the past constantly worrying about if they'll cheat on me...I truely couldn't give a F about boundaries now, if they want to cheat they'll cheat, let them show their real face and I'll be gone..

I've completely changed my mind regarding the boundaries, she thinks I've done it to get her back, but I really don't care anymore about controlling them, let them be...

coach says:
Love In A Way That The Other Feels Free

Will my complete change of boundaries make her think that I'm weak?

I think this chick will now play tit for tat when it comes to future arguments and will always bring up me treating her like crap, how can I stamp this out?

Will my pursuing of her and emotional chasing , make her think less of me? 

How can I re-establish the high interest she had for me at the start?

1jz2cop,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1jz2cop/morning_with_children_over_10_years_of_age/,Morning with children over 10 years of age,"Mornings can be challenging to get the kids up and out for school on time. I wake up at 6:30 am before everyone else, make coffee, make breakfast tidy the kitchen feed the animals. I asked my Husband to wake up at 7 AM and wake the kids up as they need to leave by 7:30. The kids have alarms but hit the snooze.
He usually rolls out of bed around 7:10 sometimes 7:15 and struggles to get them out of bed to come up for breakfast. He complains that he has to get up early. Then I’m stressing to get my youngest out the door so I can drive him to school on time.

I told my husband to wake up earlier and that the only thing I ask him to do is to wake the kids up . I take care of the breakfast, feeding animals and the driving. He says he shouldn’t have to wake up and they should get up and make their own breakfast and get themselves out the door and that we’re enabling them too much by not expecting them to do this.
 Though I believe, living by example is actually the biggest influence. Often he complains that his parents did the bare minimum, I on the other hand had an active parent helping guide the morning along and providing a nutritious breakfast to start the day which that particular parent I call everyday because we have built a bond that is very strong.

What are your thoughts on this? What is your morning look like? Who is responsible for beginning the daily tasks of the home including helping everybody get off and out of the house with a good Headstart? 
Sometimes if my Husband doesn’t wake up the time I asked him to wake and do the one thing I asked him to do, wake the children, then I don’t make him breakfast. He will ask me why.
I don’t understand why he expects me to make him breakfast, but not the kids. Seems like a selfish situation but of course I also want my children to be responsible for getting up and out on time on their own too.

1jz2bbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldwinner/comments/1jz2bbk/comprehensive_bingo_guide/,Comprehensive Bingo Guide,"Hi all,

I want to try to provide a guide for new and existing players to Bingo. For reference, I've been playing for a couple years now, and have probably made about $25k or so in that time. I always play on my phone, tablet would work as well. I have to imagine playing on PC would be significantly slower, but can't say I've tried it. I only play 1-card Bingo. Let's dive in:

**Scoring:**

In bingo, you tap/click a number that is called, and get somewhere between 100-400 points per number. 100 is the base value for each number you get, and you also earn a speed bonus worth anywhere between 0-300 points based on how quick you hit the number.

Each bingo you earn gets you 1000 points when you hit the Bingo button. If you have multiple bingo's when you click the button, then you will earn an extra 300 points per bingo as a ""multi-bingo"" bonus. There is no situation, ever, that you should be clicking that Bingo button and not having more than one Bingo (unless I guess if it's a really low scoring game and you only have 1 bingo at the end.)

You will also earn 2000 bonus points if you cover the whole board as a Blackout Bonus.

This all leads to a max score of (24 numbers x 400 points) 9600 + (13 bingo's x 1300 points) 16,900 + 2000 =  28,500

**Power-ups:**

Each time you hit a number, you will earn progress towards a power-up. If you get a ""Perfect"" daub, which means your speed score is over 225 out of 300 (75% of the progress bar that circles the number), you earn 75% progress towards a power-up. A ""Great"" daub, which is speed score 150-225, earns 50% progress towards a power-up. And a ""Good"" score, 0-15 speed score, earns 25%.

Yellow sun/Free daub: This power-up allows you to choose a number to daub for free. Speed bonus is not earned, so 100 points for each of these, which also decreases your max score potential. I save these for last typically.

Coffee cup/Choose one: Four balls will appear on the screen, and you can choose one to then daub. **You can take your time choosing which ball you want.** No speed score is lost while choosing your ball. **However,** once you choose the ball, you should be ready to hit it immediately, as that does count toward the speed score.

Three balls: Three balls will appear at the top of the screen. **The first (furthest to the left) is always a ball that you have.** So I always focus there, and hit it immediately. Then the next two balls may or may not be on your card.

**Strategy:**

Many of you probably already know everything above this. Now I will go over some things that I think help me to score well. These likely will be in no particular order...

\- **Save power-ups until you are full.** I never use a power-up unless I am full enough to not get the full 75% progress towards the next one when a number hits. There are 2 reasons for this. One, it allows me to have my finger ready to hit the power-up as soon as the next number on my card hits, which saves time. Two, I don't want to hit a number with power-up that would have been called later. Imagine a scenario where you power-up early, free daub a number, when that number actually would have been the next one called anyway. That would lose you the game typically.

\- Three balls: This is the first power-up I use. Since you have no control over what it gives, I feel it using it first allows me to better understand what I need to get with the other power-ups later. When one of my numbers is called, I immediately hit the Three balls power-up, then click the number that was called, then focus on the first (furthest left) of the three balls as I know that one will be on my card.

\- Coffee cup/Choose one: This is the second power-up I would use. When one of my numbers is called, I will click this, and take my time selecting which ball I want out of the four. When ready, I choose a number, and have my fingers ready to click **both** the number I chose, and the number that was called.

\- Yellow sun/Free daub: Lastly, I'll use this. When one of my numbers is called, I click the sun power-up, choose what space I want to daub, then rapidly tap the number that was called to maximize speed score.

\- **Memorize the corners and diagonals.** These numbers can potentially give 3-4 (vertical, horizontal, diagonal, and corners) bingo's each, as opposed to 2 (vertical, horizontal) for all other numbers. These will typically be the best options when doing the Choose one power-up, unless you are late enough in the game that you know another number that will immediately give a bingo is a better option.

\- Constantly scan the board with your eyes while waiting for the next number. This doesn't mean memorize the entire board, but generally scanning the board consistently will allow your brain to react quicker when one of your numbers is called.

\- Work on speed. Sorry, this point isn't overly helpful, is it? But it is what it is. You have to be fast to do well in Bingo. First priority in learning the game should be comfortably getting a ""Perfect"" speed score on every single number you hit.

\- Lastly...**you can save your power-ups for when the very last number of the game is called.** This is basically when the clock hits zero. As soon as the progress for the second to last number ends, and the last  number is being called, I click a power-up. I won't see what number is called, but I do hear it as the nice lady will still announce it. So basically, when the clock is at zero, I will still have 2-3 power-ups that I am ready to use. This sometimes leads to hitting that last number called, instead of wasting a power-up on it.

And that's all (I think.)",1,1744646070.0,worldwinner,0,1.0,False

I've been treating my MCAS for about 2 years now with ketotifen, low histamine diet, anti histamines, and other natural treatments, through a private doctor in the UK. I've gone from bed/housebound to full time work and study . Fatigue is my main symptom, along with dysautonomia, brain fog, brain inflammation and gastro paresis. 

When I discovered MCAS, I went on a low histamine diet and quickly discovered that food was a major trigger. If I eat something too high in histamine it's a fatigue crash within 30 mins. After 2 years, although I can now work and concentrate for long hours, walk daily and I've got so much more energy, I've not had any progress with food for a while. 

I can be less cautious of cooked food, but not really as much as I or my doctor would expect. For example,  I can cook a chicken and eat it the next day but I can't eat leftovers from a full meal. I can eat some spices that I used to not, but I can't tolerate an unripe banana still. I can eat lots of chocolate but can't eat citrus (even though they're both liberators?). I can eat instant coffee but can't take the fresh beans. 

Has anyone experienced this? My doctor wonders if there are other things going on in my gut that's stopping progress, but the end result is still a mast cell full systemic response. I don't get any gut symptoms anymore unless I eat something I shouldn't. (before I had diagnosed gastroparesis)

I did the Zoe programme and my gut score was terrible, but I couldn't eat any of the food they suggested to improve my gut health, all fermented or high histamine. My private doc suggested doing gut tests with a specialists but it would be £1000s and I don't have that ATM. 

Anyone got any ideas/tips I can try?

Edited to add: I have binge eating disorder and I do consume a lot of sugar as part of that. I can eat lots more processed food now but no wins in the fresh food department. My granddad had celiac, it started in his 40s.",2,1744645820.0,MCAS,9,1.0,False

so this is an ongoing issue with my partner. We've been together almost 3 years, and 2 years living together. Both of us late 20s.

Our apartment is tiny (kitchenette barely fitting the two of us, living room, bedroom and a tiny entrance hall + ok bathroom). Admittedly, I have a lot of stuff, but in the past having extra shelves, stands, drawer sets etc. kept it manageable. Right now everything is everywhere, because there's nowhere to store it. We have a couch and a chair, a coffee table, wardrobe, bed, telly stand and a small stand in the bathroom where I keep my makeup.

That's it. Getting the telly stand was a battle, because he was content with keeping the TV on top of one of our suitcases... we only got it because 1. the suitcase was not stable and I accidentally knocked the TV off and broke it 2. there was a free stand left by one of our neighbours to take.

I want a bookshelf, a drawer set, and to get rid of the chair because we don't use it and it takes too much space (his argument against it: it's part of a set so we should sell it together and he likes it). Shoe stand and a full body mirror would be nice too, and a night stand maybe. Our coffee table is too large and it would be better to get one half the size, as much as I love it and don't want to let it go.

That's apparently too much. My partner thinks we have too many things and getting furniture will only make it worse. I think it will give us extra vertical space to store things and put stuff away that doesn't need to be out.

I want a desk so I can set up my laptop + drawing tablet for my art, but he thinks that if I really wanted to, I'd figure a way out without buying a desk (true, but the set up takes a lot of space and I would like it to have a dedicated spot so I can actually be comfortable and be able to avoid moving it constantly, I don't think that's a luxury I'm asking for. And then I'd have a dedicated space to keep all my other art stuff too, which now sits in a cardboard box under the table and I hate it).

Another argument of his is that it's a rental and we won't be here forever, so what's the point of investing into it. We signed the lease for 6 months, we've been here 2 years and will probably stay for another half a year at least. I think it's worth it, and we can always just sell it/take it with us.

Our friend couple just moved in together and the guy is planning and getting all the furniture  and I'm just jealous that my partner has no such drive. My partner is also a bit of a slob so he keeps making extra mess on top of that.

I'm considering just buying what I need out of my own pocket and doing my thing to make this place feel like home and not a temporary military camp, and if something ever happens to us, well, at least I own some nice shit.

I'm looking through some of my stuff to get rid of as well, to compromise and declutter, but I genuinely don't think I'm in the wrong here and that it's either not normal or a caveman thing to be OK with no furniture like that, especially at the age of 27.",1,1744645615.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

So my issue is the following: I wrecked my jack port on the front I/O of my PC because, you guessed it, foot in cable, classic.

Thankfully I still have the motherboard connector, unthankfully it's full of interference (I hear coil whine in my headset if my GPU is working hard in a demanding game for example, or even simply while dowloading something) which is why I was using the front one originally.

So after some googling, I see that a USB converter could be a solution to alleviate if not outright cancel the interference. Which is why I'm asking you what would be the most interesting purchase here. Is a simple 10 bucks USB to female jack cable enough to solve the issue ? Or do I need to turn myself to some sort of DAC (even a cheap one) that might be more efficient in noise suppression ? If so, do you have some recommendations ? I'm mainly looking to remove that noise interference, I don't need anything fancy with an amp of coffee making feature.

She’s funny, easy to connect with, and I felt an instant emotional bond. We met the next day for coffee, and things clicked even more. While chatting, we opened up about mental health — I shared my struggles with anxiety, and she told me she has bipolar disorder, experiences hallucinations, hears voices, and has a history of self-harm and suicidal thoughts.

Instead of being shocked, I felt understanding. I know how hard mental health struggles can be, and I appreciated her honesty. We ended up making out, and then met again the next day. We both agreed to not define the relationship yet and to just take time to know each other.

However, in the days that followed, things got heavier. She told me about hallucinating a dead body hanging. She says she barely sleeps, and she’s not taking her meds because she feels they worsen her condition. She is in therapy though, which is good, but the situation is still intense.

I’m now extremely anxious. I’m in my final year of college and will be graduating in a year, but she has 3 more years to go. I keep thinking: what if she harms herself when I’m gone? What if my presence is the only thing keeping her stable? I talked to her about this, and she told me she wouldn’t hurt herself — but my anxiety hasn’t gone away.

My friends are telling me to walk away before I get in too deep, especially since it’s only been a few days. But I feel stuck. I’ve longed for genuine connection and care for a long time, and just when I found it, I’m scared of turning my back on it. I don’t want to hurt her — but I don’t want to lose myself either.

I’m restless, overthinking, and torn. If I step back, how will she react? Will it make things worse for her?

I’m Juan (aka RAGECOGNITO), and I’d like to introduce you to this subreddit’s purpose and spirit.

**Who We Are**

“Rage And Resist” is an extension of my broader fight against creeping authoritarianism, corporate greed, and the quiet erosion of people’s rights. Some of you may know me from my other projects—like my investigative pieces on corruption, my push to protect ethical civil servants, or my “show, don’t oversell” writing on other platforms. Regardless of how you found us, I’m glad you’re here.

While **anyone can read** the content we share, only **approved members** can post or comment. We keep the gates tight so our discussions remain focused, fact-based, and free from spam or malicious interference. Think of this as a “war journal” and resource bank for those in the trenches—activists, organizers, journalists, and bold community members.

**Why We Rage (and Resist)**

1. **Exposing Power Abuses:** We shine a light on hidden deals, suspicious government/corporate ties, and the subtle ways authoritarian impulses creep into everyday life.
2. **Championing Civil Service:** From whistleblowers to frontline public employees, we stand with the people who keep democracy running who currently face retaliation from above.
3. **Building Real-World Solidarity:** We’re done with empty slogans. Here, we share strategies, resources, and calls to action that lead to tangible change—whether in your own town or on a broader scale.

**Our Values & Rules**

* **Respectful Rebellion:** We’re unapologetically blunt about systemic injustices, but we treat each other with decency. Personal attacks or hateful speech have no place here.
* **No Calls to Violence or Doxxing:** We fight to *protect* people from harm, not to create more. Anyone crossing that line will be swiftly removed.
* **“Show, Don’t Oversell”:** We hate over-hyped marketing. Let actions speak louder than slogans. Share verified facts, tangible evidence, and real-life experiences.
* **Focus on Solutions:** We welcome incisive critique, but let’s push toward next steps. Where can we turn investigative findings into organized resistance?
* **Membership By Invitation:** If you’re an organizer, activist, or someone with relevant expertise—and you want to post/comment—reach out via Modmail. We’ll do a brief vetting process. If you’re just here to learn or follow along, feel free to lurk and read publicly visible posts.

**How to Contribute**

* **Reading & Observing:** Anyone can read. If you find a post helpful, consider sharing it outside, *if* you feel comfortable.
* **Requesting Membership:** Message the mods or respond to our pinned instructions. We may ask a few questions about your background or reason for joining.
* **Providing Information:** If you have credible documents or leads on wrongdoing, let us know (privately in Modmail, for instance). We respect good op-sec (operational security), so never share sensitive intel in public comments.
* Other support options include connecting or donating to:

**The Road Ahead**

“Rage And Resist” is about channeling frustration into constructive action. My past writings reflect that sense of urgency: we can’t let the wealthy or powerful quietly reshape our democracy while we stand by. This space, therefore, is a beacon to those who want real solutions—investigative, activist-driven, and fearless.

If you’re new, welcome. If you’ve been in the fight a while, welcome back. Together, we keep pushing, keep revealing, and keep building networks that stand up to systemic abuses.

Stay bold, stay fearless—and thank you for being part of this determined, disruptive, and deeply compassionate community.

She’s funny, easy to connect with, and I felt an instant emotional bond. We met the next day for coffee, and things clicked even more. While chatting, we opened up about mental health — I shared my struggles with anxiety, and she told me she has bipolar disorder, experiences hallucinations, hears voices, and has a history of self-harm and suicidal thoughts.

Instead of being shocked, I felt understanding. I know how hard mental health struggles can be, and I appreciated her honesty. We ended up making out, and then met again the next day. We both agreed to not define the relationship yet and to just take time to know each other.

However, in the days that followed, things got heavier. She told me about hallucinating a dead body hanging. She says she barely sleeps, and she’s not taking her meds because she feels they worsen her condition. She is in therapy though, which is good, but the situation is still intense.

I’m now extremely anxious. I’m in my final year of college and will be graduating in a year, but she has 3 more years to go. I keep thinking: what if she harms herself when I’m gone? What if my presence is the only thing keeping her stable? I talked to her about this, and she told me she wouldn’t hurt herself — but my anxiety hasn’t gone away.

My friends are telling me to walk away before I get in too deep, especially since it’s only been a few days. But I feel stuck. I’ve longed for genuine connection and care for a long time, and just when I found it, I’m scared of turning my back on it. I don’t want to hurt her — but I don’t want to lose myself either.

I’m restless, overthinking, and torn. If I step back, how will she react? Will it make things worse for her?

Would really appreciate advice from anyone who’s been through something similar. How do I handle this with care — for both of us?",1,1744645322.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

“You can do this,” I told myself, and walked in.

“Hi. My name is Samantha Wilkins - I’m here for the accounting position. It’s my first day.”

“Oh, right! Welcome!” The professionally-yet-comfortably-dressed woman led me to my desk. “I’m Jill - let me know if you need anything. Good luck!”

I was just settling in when I looked up to a man staring at me. 

“Well hello! You must be new.”

I nodded. “I’m Samantha,” I said, holding out my hand. First impressions matter. 

“I’m Brad,” he said, taking my hand in an overly familiar way while looking me up and down. “If you need anything, and I mean *anything*, you just call me.”

“I’ll… keep that in mind,” I replied, mentally resolving never to call him.

“You do that,” he said, walking away. “And smile! It makes you look a lot prettier.”

I watched him leave, repulsed but unsurprised. There was always one. Later, I ran into Jill at the copy machine. 

“So what’s the deal with Brad?”

Her professional smile turned sour. “Oh, him. He’s a real creep, but he’s the owner’s nephew. Best to steer clear of him.”

I nodded, returning her look with understanding. Nothing we both hadn’t seen before.

Later that day, I was alone in the mostly-empty office, getting coffee in the break room. 

“Still here?”

I turned quickly to find Brad standing behind me. 

“Yeah, just trying to get ahead - lots to learn.”

“That’s admirable,” he said, moving closer to me, “but a girl like you doesn’t need to work that hard to move up the ladder here. I can help you, if you want.”

As he spoke, he stepped closer to me. Unconsciously, I felt myself reaching for the pepper spray I kept in my purse. 

“I’ll definitely keep you in mind if I need anything,” I replied, hoping my voice stayed steady. 

He stared at me for a moment - my heart raced. *Would I have to defend myself? Would anyone believe me?*

Then he backed away. “You do that - I’m here to help. And remember - smile! Nothing brightens your day like a smile.”

With that, he walked out. After a moment, I left, gathered my things, and went home. 

Later that night, I walked down into my basement to visit my trophies. The construction worker who catcalled me. The cab driver who lectured me on my outfit. The hardware salesman who condescendingly explained the tools I’ve used more than him. They all hung, chained to the walls, their faces carved into grotesque grins. I’d learned from last time - these were all strangers no one would connect to me. I sat there, feeling myself relax as I relived their panicked realizations, the feel of the knife in my hands. 

It’s true. Nothing brightens your day like a smile. ",6,1744645167.0,shortscarystories,1,1.0,False

In the last 24 hours I have had a few significant anxiety attacks: heart racing and upset stomach. I have not felt symptoms this significant since starting sertraline over 10 years ago.

I don’t have any new stressors (I am a working mom of four, so life is always functionally stressful), other than sleep deprivation/body clock being off after traveling and back last week between the Midwest US and Hawaii (6 hours difference). My kids’ spring activities ramp up considerably this week, which always increases my stress level but not to the point of near panic.

I have not changed my caffeine intake (will stop coffee til I get this under control).

I’m going to be visiting this illustrious city next weekend, meeting up with one of my best friends (I’m coming from Detroit, she will be coming from Northern California).

If you only had a few days in the city, where would you go to eat? Also, if there are there are any amazing places by the Met please let me know…We are going to a concert there next Saturday night 4/25. Where are the best places for late night food (11:00 pm or later…my friend’s flight gets in at 10:00 p.m.)?

Best coffee shops? Best bagels? Best breakfast? Best sweet treats?!

This last bit is not food related, but…Best vintage/thrift stores? Any cool comic book/pop culture/game shops? Neat stores for little kids (I have a 3.5 and 1 year old…clearly mom has to come back with something!) Best areas/neighborhoods for shopping in general (small/independent businesses)

Anything at all (food, attractions, shopping…) that you feel is can’t-miss?

May contain t/w of neglect , abuse , I’ll try not to go to into to much detail on them though 
And sorry if it doesn’t make a lot of sense 

I (28f) went no contact with my mother about 6 months ago and everyone is still trying to get me to forgive her and saying she isn’t a bad person but is refusing to even let me tell the more then 2 minutes of the story so I’m going to start at the very beginning  a total of 7 children all up but a good chunk of time is just us 3 eldest (2 separate dads same mother) 

In 1998 myself and my two sisters (3 children 3yrs ,2yrs and 1yrs) where removed from my parents for neglect , dr*gs ,alcohol and dv,
My sisters and my self where often found in dippers to full to even say if they where changed once a day . Dirty clothes . Running around a fairly decent sized property un-supervised (not sure actual size) . Known to run around the streets unsupervised . My older sister (I’m the middle child ) had saved me from drowning in a pond and we where known buy people of the town to be seen playing “chicken” with trains and cars.
My father was an alcoholic and both parents dabbled in all sorts of dr*gs but all ways smoked the plant. We ended up being removed because my father got drunk one day and was hanging out with a couple of friends in the back yard . My mother apparently didn’t like it so went out side and wanted them to all leave . I believe they ran out of the plant and she was just starting stuff because she is sober and I’m guessing she doesn’t like the felling (26 years later she still does when she has no plant) 
She started hitting and threatening my father who in turn got angry and started chasing her . In my mother’s words he picked up an axe and tried to chase her around the outside of the house . But he was apparently that drunk he kept falling over and could barely walk and could not even speak properly. The story continues to them coming around the front of the house and child protection services happened to be driving past and seen them . So they pulled in and called the police . Now this next part I remember vividly keep in mind I was 2 years old . I remember my father being in handcuffs being put into the back of a police car one of those with the big box on the back (we call them paddy wagons) and my mother screaming at cps and the cops for sticking their nose in where it don’t need to be . Just in a much nastier way . Me and my two sisters where then loaded up into the back of a silver sedan and taken to a strangers house for a while . My next memory was about 3 years old moving in my my Nan (my dads mum) and shortly after going to see my dad in jail on his birthday . By the time I was 4 I remember my mum and my stepdad who was in her life before my dad (believe she was cheating on my dad with him ) coming to visit us at our nans . She was always very distant like she didn’t really care to see us . Cared more about speaking with the adults around then her 3 young children who where trying to get their mums attention. She was also always high.
This was also around the time my father had gotten out of jail . He would always come and visit us. He would always try his very best to be sober . I should also mention that he had severe epilepsy. By the time I was 4 my Nan had a stroke which lead to her ending up in a nursing home and lost a lot of mobility. She is still there to this day apparently . my dad signed his rights over to cps because he knew with his epilepsy he could not have 3 young kids in his own . We ended up being placed with our aunty (my dad’s sister) who would allow us to have supervised visits with my mum but not my dad as they never got along . My mum would quite often not show up for visits and when she did she was always high always promising to buy us a present for birthdays and Christmas but never follow through. She then had a baby with my step dad (my first brother) another 3 would follow in the next 6 yrs. Now even though this part doesn’t have much to do with my mom but it’s a big part of our lives . While me and my sisters were living with my aunt and her husband (I was aged 4-9 during this time ) we were subjected to abuse . Often made to stand in the corner facing to wall or made to stand out side in the middle of the night in “time out “ often going with out food or water often not being allowed to go to the toilet and often hit with sticks, belts , tools anything they could get there hand on. If we so as cried we would be punished. We were bullied at school and when ever anyone asked what was wrong I would just say I want my mum . This next part is what makes it relevant to my mum and is what lead to me to stop asking for her during these years . I remember when I was about 6 years old i seen this lady walk out of the house next door to my aunts and she looked so much like my mum that I ran up to her and said “mum I missed you” she looked dead at me and goes “I don’t know you I’m not your mum “ now at 6yrs old I was so heart broken convinced it was my mum who didn’t want me I stop crying for her but never stopped wanting my mum if that makes sense . We were eventually removed from my aunt as the school caught on about the abuse because my sister could not sit down one day at school.. again trying not to go into to much detail but the abuse was so bad doctors said we wouldn’t not of lived another 6 months in that house . We where then moved to more placements and cps made it known that we were not to be separated. Because I was very traumatised I was very mentally unstable. Cried a lot and had developed ptsd and severe eating disorder. A lot of people didn’t want me so all 3 of us moved around . We were finally placed in a good home . We were finally able to see our dad again and built a good relationship with him . He always made sure he was sober and visits were only supervised because of his epilepsy. And on the odd visit with my mom she would tell us girls things that she should not say to children and continued her previous behaviour on visits . Eventually she stop showing up all together. By this stage she had just had our youngest siblings and he was 1 years old and cps had stepped in and removed all 4 youngest 2 boys and 2 girls for the same things as we where removed for . We started having visits with them and building a bond . 
Fast forward to when I was 11 my older sister and the lady who we were placed with started fighting a lot and she decided to leave and go to another home . Myself and my younger sister stayed with this lady. Visits with dad still continued. When I was 15 still struggling to cope with my mental health but not knowing I was mentally unstable me and the lady who we was living with started fighting all the time . I had just found out my older sister ran away to my mum and I ended up in home after home until I was 16 and decided to go to my mum too. When I say it was the worst mistake of my life I mean it . I still seen my dad and he was honestly fantastic when I seen him but my mum and I ended up homeless and my sister moved into her own home . My mum and I were moving from hotel to hotel for 3 months and I found out my step dad was an addict to everything and was very abusive to everyone . My mum would leave the hotel before 6am and would not get back until after 10pm everyday always with my step dad . I was still in school and at this stage had a job and a boyfriend and trying to find a home for us . My dad’s friend offered myself and my mum a room each in her home to give us stability. When I told my mum she went ballistic and kicked me out . My sister had just moved into a two bedroom place and offered me a room to which I took . My mum would come and see us every day asking for money and food . If we didn’t have money to give her she would go ballistic and take off . Me and my sister trying to still have our mum would bend over backwards trying to please her and do what ever she wanted . When I turned 17 my sister said she couldn’t do it anymore and went nc for about 6 months . But I kept at it . My mum moved back in with my step dad and one day I went to see her and my step dad was asking questions and on this day he was sober and being civil and asked what house we lived in with my aunt and I told him the address. Turns out during that time he and my mum where staying in the house next door to my aunts and he said he thought that cries of children he could hear where us girls but couldn’t get a glimpse off us . I was instantly heartbroken because that ment the woman who I thought was my mum when I was 6 was my mum and she still denied it . ( I have a very distinct look and have always looked the same my whole life ) . I brushed it off and copped it on the chin because I was to stubborn and still wanted my mum . When I went back to my sisters and told her about it she was angry and we ended up in a big fight and I ended up moving in with my boy friend. He ended up getting toxic and abusive but I thought I was in love and stayed . Second biggest mistake of my life . By the time I was 18 my brother (stepdads and mums eldest) decided to move in with my mum and I got my own place . My sister started talking to my mum again . And I quit my job over my boss . Not a good work environment but that’s not this story or a story I will tell . My mum still continued getting money and food of me and my sister gifted me a cat . She bent over backwards using our money this time to spoil my brother . Still never paying any bills and spending all the money she got (her money) on plants . My brother put in his Xmas list that year and my sister and I helped mum fund it $2000 worth . He got everything he asked and in Xmas day me and my sister got nothing but my brother was so ungrateful he started to smash everything up . I should note he was 14yrs old . And he is grown up now . Anyway I yelled at him to stop being ungrateful as he is lucky mum even made the effort for him as she never did for us . She got extremely angry at me and told me to apologise to her and my brother and said I’m the big sister and have to let my younger Siblings get there way . 
My brother after that came to see me and apologised and changed his way. Which as a big sister I seen as my job to correct his behaviour especially if our parent was not going to . Just before I turned 19 my mum had a big argument with my sister and she ended up going nc with her again and moved to another state for a fresh start . My boyfriend moved in with me and I was stupid enough to allow him to . When I turned 19 my younger sister (step dad’s kid ) decided she wanted to come home to mum . And she was also ungrateful for anything I did and when I put her in her place my mum flipped a table at me . My sister and my brother tried telling mum that I was right and she shouldn’t have a go at me for trying to correct the wrong behaviour. Fast forward 6 months and my bf tried to unalive me and I finally realised I was going down a very bad path and broke up with him . My mum knew cause the cops dropped me off at hers until my bf got his stuff out and she seen the marks on me but didn’t even speak to me and ignored that I was even there . The next day when I went to go to the shop my younger sister called me and told me that my bf was there as mum called him and invited him over for a coffee to check on and make sure he was ok . I was again heartbroken but brushed it off . He eventually left and I ended up hooking up with another guy . I made it known we were not together and he said he was fine with that . I was taking all possible measures to make sure I didn’t get pregnant but turns out I some how ended up pregnant. I believe he set it up but anyway he started to get very clingy would not let me leave his place one day and put me in a bear hug and fractured my ribs . The only way to get out was to punch him in the arms . He called the police and I was arrested and let out on bail pending court and had to move to my older sisters in the other state . I packed my house up and organised with my mum to have my cat until I could get down to get him as I was going by train . The last night in town my mum said she could not have my stuff i
Or my cat and had asked the guy who I had just had a fight with to take it behind my back and we had another fight but I still stayed at hers as I seen it as 1 more night and I’m outta here . How ever my step dad and my mum where trying to get me to take drugs and I kept saying no and they kept trying . I ended up leaving and staying at the train station for 9 hours until the train arrived and I left and went no contact for the first time . The day I arrived at my sisters I found out I was pregnant and two weeks later I told that guy and still said we where not together but as long as his a good dad I would not stop him for having something to do with the child . He ending up coming up for the ultrasound and basically forced himself into my life and would not leave . I had my child at 20 and we fought all the time and I kept trying to leave and no one I knew helped me not even the police . For my 21st birthday my brother called and convinced me to come and see me with mum . So I finally let her back in . 2 months later my daughter father tried locking me inside a room and hid my phone so I could not call for help . When he tried to lock the door I pushed him in hopes I could get out and he called the police and had me arrested again and they didn’t believe a word I said . I was let off with an avo and left my home again just to get away from him . Everyone I knew including my sister believed all the lies he said and turned there back on me so I had no choice to go to my mums . 3 months later I met my now partner and moved in with him and his sister and he is just perfect. Honestly I got lucky . I went to court for my daughter and got full custody as my daughter father was stalking and threatening us. And I proved to every one I was a good mum and the my daughter father was toxic and abusive . Everyone finally started to apologise to me and even the judge was so angry that the police refused to help me and said I was lucky to get out . me and my now partner moved 12 hours away to raise my daughter in a fresh new place surrounded by his family . My mum finally left my step dad and moved 14hrs away from me . It seemed like we both were making a new start and life got better. My mum how ever asked me for money again and around the time I was up to my neck in bills working my ass off everyday trying to get on top of everything and I said no . My younger sister (step dads kid) decided that she didn’t like me saying no to mum and started ringing and texting while I was at work saying some very nasty things worse then what you could imagine about my childhood about my exs about my daughter and my father who was extremely sick at the time on his death bed . I blocked her and have been nc as there is no coming back from that . But 2 years ago my dad passed away from liver failure and what we believe was throat cancer . We didn’t get much from him . A couple of jumpers a Wallet purfume and a tin shared between us 3 oldest girls. My mum decided to come and visit us about 6 months ago now (2024) and while I was at work she helped herself to dad’s tin and decided to use it to put her plant in it and tried to put it in her hand bag in the attempts to keep it . She got caught by my partner. 
Now this tin was in my personal stuff and she had no clue about it which ment that she has to go through my things to find it . She has been known to have sticky fingers and taking things from her kids before . Anyway my partner told her she had to tell me and she had the audacity to send me a text message saying “ hey I used your tin and *partner* said you would be angry but I know you won’t be and it is fine * 
I got so angry as it’s one of the only things I have of dads and she had already tried to get me to give her something else of his . I rung my partner up and told him to tell her she had to be out of my house before I got home to which she heard as the phone was one loud speaker and she tried to talk but I just hung up .
She was still there when I got back home and tried to tell me my partner gave it to her and he said that was not true and I know both of them and I know she was lying no doubt. She started saying that my partner and his family is my family now and I don’t care about her anymore and essentially trying to gaslight and manipulate me into letting her stay. She started going on how my partner is not good for me even though he literally bends over backwards trying his best to give me and my daughter the best life he can . He is an amazing man and father figure to my child . His family are saints compared to mine . I got even more angry and kicked her out and went no contact . 
She knows my mother in law is a very kind person and will feel bad for anyone and everyone. She went there any told her I refused to help her and I refused to listen to her and pulled at my mother in laws heart strings . Now for the past 6 months everyone is trying to get my to forgive her and let her back in because “you only get one mum “ and I have said that I mentally can not do it any more and I refuse to let her back into my life because the cycle keeps going around and around . My partner said he doesn’t want to get in the middle as he doesn’t speak to her unless she is Hear and said if I don’t want to have her around that we he is happy with that and won’t let her in the house if I’m not home . I spoke with my sisters to my dad and they agree  with me and said that I should never of let her back in . I finally realised that I will never be good enough for her . I am not that little girl anymore who craves my mum . I have come to terms that she will never be the mum I want and need . 
She did rock up about in nov of 2024 out of the blue and I told her I don’t want to see her and she screamed at me that Its all my fault and that I gave her the tin so she changed her lie again . And I kicked her out again . She said she wanted to come here for Xmas and I can’t stop her because she wants to visit my mil and I told Everyone she comes to town I will leave and the will not see my daughter for Xmas . Which I hated to give that ultimatum but I was not having that toxic behaviour ruin my Xmas with my daughter . So everyone picked my daughter and told her not to come . She has not tried to reach out to anyone since so I think she finally got it . 

People still think I’m being to harsh. 
But I think I’m well in my right and since I have gone nc I have a much better mental health and I am thriving . She has been the only source of problem to my happy life in the past 7 years . It’s like she couldn’t handle my growth as a person and as a mother . I don’t mean to toot my own horn but I’m a good mum and my daughter is thriving and I don’t want her to potentially ruin that . I’ll note that she has never been alone with my child but she has always given her gifts and been essentially a good grandmother . But I never let my guard down and everyone knows she won’t be alone with her. My daughter has also not asked about her once since I went nc 

So AITA for going no contact with my mother ? 
Am I being to harsh.

Ps there will be no update as this is the full story and I will try my best to respond but I am a very busy person with work and my little family that I quite often forget to reply to people or even check comments . ",1,1744644706.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,0.99,False

I’m planning a trip for my girlfriend’s birthday in July and was hoping to get some guidance on a rough itinerary. We both live in Seattle and have never been to any of the islands. Given this is only a weekend trip (2 nights Fri/Sat) I’d like to try and minimize the travel time so I was thinking of just staying and moving around on Orcas. We’ll have a car so transportation shouldn’t be too much of an issue.

The goal for the trip is relaxation with some nature during the day and then at night we enjoy good food with a few cocktails/drinks.

The plan I have so far is to take the ferry Friday afternoon from Anacortes and head to Orcas island. For lodging somewhere a little more isolated with views is preferred (Rosario looked nice, but seems it’s not great anymore?). Saturday sleep in a bit, grab a coffee/pastry at Orcas Bakery (she likes pastries, I love coffee) and then head out to Moran State Park to explore/do a little hiking. In the evening for dinner I was thinking Matia, but again open to suggestions. Sunday morning is there anywhere to catch a pretty sunrise or enjoy a lookout? After check-out, explore the town some and then head back to Seattle in the afternoon. Open to suggestions on places to stop on the way back to Seattle from Anacortes as well. Thanks for any advice!

1jz1ndh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1jz1ndh/the_only_time_i_feel_truly_functional_like_im/,"The only time I feel truly functional, like I’m actually good at life is when I’m living alone.","And it’s not just about moment-to-moment frustration — I think it feeds into a **vicious loop** I’ve been stuck in for a long time:

* If I have ADHD, I struggle to get basic tasks done
* That leads to missing things or falling behind
* Which causes stress, so I stay up late trying to catch up
* Then I wake up tired
* I skip breakfast or my morning routine
* My mental performance drops even further
* I start relying on coffee or cigarettes to cope
* My sleep suffers again
* And the loop resets

Living with other people makes that loop spin way faster. It’s like my brain never gets a chance to reset. But when I’m alone, the loop slows down — sometimes even breaks.

I’ve been thinking about this pattern in my life, and I’m wondering if anyone else has felt something similar. The short version is:

>

I’m not diagnosed with ADHD yet (I just started seeing a psychologist), but my mom and older brother are both diagnosed, and the signs have been lining up for a while. One of the clearest patterns I’ve noticed is this:

When I’m around other people — roommates, family, whatever — even simple tasks start falling apart. But when I live alone? Everything just works. Routines click. Chores don’t feel like chores. My brain calms down.

Let me give an example. I have a hard time with food prep — not just cooking, but the entire mental load around it. Like:

* I’m weirdly “blind” when trying to find ingredients (they could be right in front of me and I won’t see them)
* If I *do* find something, it might be gone later — someone else used it or moved it
* If there’s no bread or eggs or whatever I planned for, I suddenly have to improvise — and that tiny curveball can derail my *entire* day

That kind of unpredictability kills my momentum. And it’s not just food — it’s the whole vibe of shared spaces. Random noise, things being out of place, not knowing who’s going to interrupt me... it all stacks up into friction. And when executive function is already on thin ice, that friction is all it takes to tip everything over.

I’ve been living in a messier, noisier shared house with my older brother and his wife. I recently forced some structure into my day:  
I made a simple note on my phone and set alarms. When they go off, I check the time, look at the note, and just *do what it says* — no thinking, no deciding. And it actually worked. It was like I finally gave my brain a quiet room to work in — and that room was a schedule.

But what really stuck with me is this:

>

So here’s my question:  
**Is this a known thing?** Do people with ADHD function significantly better when they’re living alone — because they finally have environmental control and minimal external noise?

It explains so much for me. Like:

* Why dishes or walking the dog feel effortless when I’m solo
* Why I spiral when someone else is in the kitchen
* Why I get nothing done unless I feel like I have “my territory”

Anyone else experience this? Or build systems around this kind of lifestyle?",3,1744644437.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False
1jz1md1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jz1md1/candle_wax_part_1/,Candle Wax [Part 1],"Should I have stayed in Toronto? It’s the question I keep asking myself. If I knew what would happen when I moved to Greenwood, I’m sure I would have stayed as far away as possible. But if I had the chance to erase it all now, would I? I would be happier if I didn’t know what was out there, but it would be a lie.

 

Is having my eye open worth being forced to sleep with it open?

 

At the end of the day, it’s my job. It’s the life I chose, and I regret nothing about the life I chose. I believe that secrets, especially the darkest ones, need to be brought to light. So this is me, bringing them to light.

 

Journaling was a therapy thing at first, but it quickly became useful as a detective. Sorting feelings from facts, compartmentalizing, keeping things from getting personal. Its success rate varied. But in this case, it was a tool for compiling the events of last summer as I experienced them.

 

As of today, as I begin recounting that long waking nightmare, my birthday was three days ago. I got a t-shirt. Women’s medium. A replacement of one I lost. On my birthday last year, the only gift I got was from me to myself. That gift was moving to Greenwood. A place I had always loved, ever since visiting as a child.

 

I drove up there in my car on a sunny Tuesday morning. Daniels, my partner for two years in Toronto, followed me in his pick-up truck with all my furniture. I accumulated a fair few favors from the man in those two years and it was time to collect.

 

The air got better. The roads got worse. As I reached the first stretch of prairies, I knew I made the right choice. It was gorgeous. I drove with the windows down for hours and hours. I had made a whole new-wave pop-rock playlist for the road, but it turned out I didn’t need it. I just listened to the crashing of the wind, and I was happy. Even the smells made me smile. I’d take fresh farm manure over street pigeon shit any day.

 

We arrived Wednesday night and Daniels was off by Thursday morning. No emotional farewell, just a handshake and a “good luck” – and there I was. Home, in a one-bedroom basement unit of a six unit building. It was quaint, modest, and a damn sight cheaper than Toronto. Mrs. Fredricks, the sweet old landlady swung by and was about as stark opposite from my old landlord as you could get. She even offered to help me unpack.

 

“It’s always good to get it done right away.” She said. “First you put it off one day, then you put it off one week, then before ya know it it’s two years later and you still got these damn boxes layin’ around.”

 

“Yeah, I know what you mean.” I replied, trying to match her friendliness to the best of my social ability.

 

“Do you have more stuff coming, or?” She inquired.

 

“No, this is it.”

 

“Wow. Light packer, eh?”

 

“Yeah... It’s easier that way, I suppose.”

 

“What is it you do for work, hun?”

 

“Oh I’m uh... I’m an RCMP Detective. Just transferred.”

 

Mrs. Fredricks’ eyes lit up. I might as well have said I was in the circus.

 

“Really? That’s fantastic! Well, I tell you what, I feel safer already.”

 

I expected to receive some big reactions like that. I didn’t exactly fit the rural law enforcement phenotype. But I was thoroughly charmed by her comment. She gave me a hug and told me to come see her if I needed anything. It was a warmer welcome than I could’ve asked for.

 

Unpacking was going to have to wait, though. As would sightseeing and all else. I got my bare essentials out and ready, and then I had to prepare for work in the morning. No rest for the wicked.

 

Maybe I would have savored the day more if I had known it was going to be my last happy one. Before it all went to hell. Before the case, the nightmares, the girl who wasn’t missing... before Candle Caine.

 

I woke myself up two minutes before my 5 AM alarm that day. Maybe it was the nerves. I was usually better about managing that sort of thing. In any case I was glad to wake up to silence. A little nugget of peace before the work begins.

 

The easiest way to ease nerves is to just stick to your routine, so that’s what I did. Starting with 15 push-ups, 15 sit-ups, 15 lunges, 15 squats, and three 30 second planks. Then stretches.

 

The sun had just begun shining through the blinds of my bedroom, casting deep orange lines against the far wall. In a way, it made it not look quite so bare. I made a mental note to make time to unpack more as soon as I could.

 

I showered, I brushed my teeth, and applied a trivial amount of make-up. Concealer and some mascara mainly. I typically wouldn’t bother but first impressions are important.

 

I didn’t have a chance to meal prep, but I had enough foresight to unpack some granola bars and coffee. It would do for now.

 

I left the apartment before 7 and arrived at my new HQ 10 minutes later.

 

“Hello miss, how may I help you?” The receptionist greeted with a smile and a drawl. She was teetering on elderly but not quite retirement age yet.

 

“Hi. Detective Cole, I’ve just transferred here. I’m to speak with the Chief Inspector, I believe.”

 

“Oh, Miss Cole... We weren’t expecting you ‘til 8.” She responded, still sounding chipper.

 

“I can wait if you like.” I offered.

 

“Oh no, he’s not doin’ nothin’.” She turned around and began shouting, “Favret! I got Miss Cole here!”

 

Sure enough, out from the door in the back stepped a large man in a shirt and tie, brandishing a less enthusiastic smile then the receptionist.

 

“Cole! Right this way.” He said, gesturing me to follow as he held the door open.

 

We walked down some halls and past some cubicles. Functionally it was fairly similar to my previous employment, aesthetically it was far less so, but that was to be expected. The atmosphere was unkempt but homey. It was less clinical, less industrial, and I liked it. My first impression of my coworkers as I passed them was “lackadaisical.“

 

The Chief Inspector led me into his office where he sat behind his desk. He gestured for me to take a seat and I obliged.

 

“I’m Chief Inspector Favret, we’ve spoken on the phone. Welcome. How are you liking Greenwood so far?” He asked, somewhere between stilted pleasantry and curt.

 

“It’s uh- it’s great, sir. Very peaceful.” I answered with a somewhat forced smile.

 

“Bit different from Toronto I reckon.”

 

“Yes, sir. Big change.”

 

“Well, that’s alright. I know you’ll get used to it... It’s not all hicks here, you know.”

 

I forced a light chuckle in response. I couldn’t help feeling a subtle but immediate tension in the air. Either he was judging me, or he assumed I was judging him. Maybe both.

 

“I mean it.” He continued. “You may be the only... lady... we have here, but lots of folks come over from the big cities. You’ll find many a kindred spirit I’m sure. In fact, your new partner was a New Yorker.” He explained.

 

“My new partner?” I questioned, suppressing a small cringe at the way he said ‘lady’. Though, his cadence also made the words ‘New Yorker’ sound like an exotic animal.

 

“Oh yeah we got a spot for you, don’t worry. His recent partner quit, and he’s working a new assignment. Small stuff, easy start. So you’re gonna shadow him for a bit, and he can show you how we do things here. He’s been here a long time, so you’re in good hands.” He said with utmost assurance.

 

“Sounds good, sir.”

 

“Fantastic, I’m gonna leave the rest to Wally, you’ll find him out there. Big white guy, beard, greying a bit. You’ll know him when you see him.”

 

“Thank you, sir.” I said as I stood up and made my way out of the thickened air of his office.

 

Outside among the cubicles I saw quite a few men, standing or lounging around and chatting. Almost all of them were large white guys with beards. Favret couldn’t have been less helpful. I had to use my ears instead. He said New Yorker, that shouldn’t be too tough to suss out in this backwoods place.

 

“No it’s not condensed milk, it’s evaporated milk. Condensed milk is sweetened-“ Not him.

 

“You’ve got a problem man. Two hundred dollars? What was it last time-“ Not him.

 

“That’s what I’m saying. No. It was overtime and he’s got the puck-” Definitely not him.

 

“Bro I swear to god if you call them Uggs one more time-“ That’s the guy.

 

I waited for him to finish his somewhat hostile conversation and then I approached.

 

“Uh excuse me, are you... Wally?”

 

The man turned his head towards me with a scowl. He was a husky man. Tall, a little overweight, but he looked sturdy. I’d compare him to a fridge. He appeared to be somewhere in the early to mid 40s range, grizzled, with a messy beard and an unkempt undercut that was greying on the sides. He had a nose that looked like it was best friends with a baseball bat, its bridge winded like a country road. His eyes were dark and piercing, with surprisingly full lashes, though I wasn’t going to tell him that.

 

“The fuck did you say to me?” He snapped.

 

“Oh, I’m sorry. I’m new here, the Chief Inspector told me-“

 

“Yeah, yeah, new girl. He was sayin’ about that. Alright first of all, it ain’t Wally. That’s not my name. It’s Detective Gray, show some respect.” He said, about as prickly as humanly possible. The New York accent wasn’t front and center, but it was definitely there underneath all the gruff.

 

“Sorry, Detective Gray. I’m Detective Cole, nice to meet you.” I said attempting to remain cordial and friendly as I extended my hand.

 

“Psh.” He dismissed, rejecting the handshake. “You been briefed on the case, yeah?”

 

“Uh... I have not. Favret told me you would brief me.”

 

Gray chuckled and seethed, “Course he did... I’ll catch you up in the car, let’s go.”

 

He stood up and walked and I followed. I knew instantly he was going to be a pain in the ass to work with, but it wasn’t too dissimilar from people I’ve had to work with before.

 

The rugged street punk from New York turned backwoods detective vibe threw me for a loop though. Beneath the harsh unpleasantness I was feeling, I was fascinated by him. What brought a guy like him to a place like this? Was it the same thing that brought me here?

 

We walked to his car. It was an old tan shitbox of some variety. Looked like it was from the 70s. I hopped in the passenger seat and he hopped in the driver’s.

 

“Let me ask you somethin’... Cole, was it?”

 

“Yeah.”

 

“You’re young, right? You’re on that TikTok and shit?”

 

“I’m not on TikTok, no.”

 

“But you know about all that right?”

 

“...A little bit?”

 

“Well, alright, doesn’t matter, so here’s the deal. Not to disappoint you on your first day but this case ain’t shit.” Gray explained. “Mother tries to file a missing persons for her daughter, she’s been gone eight weeks, whatever, right? Turns out she ain’t missing at all because we check her, uh, “socials” and she’s in Paris on a vacation that her mom knew about the whole time.”

 

“Really? So, why is this a case at all then?”

 

“It’s not. She’s a nut. Her daughter posts these vlogs or TikToks daily – apparently she’s even got a big following – all from Paris talkin’ bout how great it is eating fucking snails or whatever. But the mother still wants to file the report anyway. She won’t let it go.”

 

“Interesting.” I answered.

 

“Annoying.” He countered. “So we’re going to see her, and hopefully put a pin in this whole thing. That’s about it. Any questions?”

 

I shook my head.

 

“Great, I wasn’t gonna answer ‘em anyway.” He quipped as we pealed off from the parking lot.

 

The drive was quiet and I felt the urge to ask him some basic questions. I didn’t care to be his friend, or to really know him on any level, but I needed this friction to ease up at least a little bit for my own sanity. I started with a softball.

 

“So, you’re not from here?”

 

“Ha! Detective of the year over here folks.”

 

Funnily enough it was that one response that gave me all I needed to know about him. He was a miserable prick, sure. But he was also a jaw-jacker. A ball-buster. I put myself in a new frame of mind: Don’t take him too seriously, don’t be afraid of him, and try not to lose your cool.

 

“What brought you here?” I asked.

 

He shook his head, “Christ, Cole. You want my life story?”

 

“Well if we’re going to be working together...”

 

He laughed, “We ain’t gonna be working together for long, trust me.”

 

I stopped talking. I guess he was content with the tension for now.

 

We arrived at a modest two story house which I could only assume belonged to the mother.

 

“Just hang back and don’t talk. Hopefully we put this all to bed now.” Gray said as he knocked on the front door.

 

The door opened to a middle aged woman. Likely late 40s or early 50s. She was well put together, despite being a bit dishevelled. A look of deep concern was written on her face.

 

“So?” She spoke, cutting to the chase. “Any news?”

 

“How are ya, Evelyn?” Gray greeted, with a far less rough tone than I had experienced to this point.

 

Evelyn walked away from the door, an unspoken invitation to let ourselves in.

 

“Who’s that?” She asked, pointing at me.

 

“New kid. Showin’ her the ropes and all.” Gray responded. Another subtle way of taking the piss I figured. I guess I had to get used to this.

 

“Great. I’m glad you’ve over here training people while my daughter’s missing.” Miss Lavoy admonished.

 

“Come on Evelyn, you know I take this seriously, but you gotta give me somethin’ here. Make it make sense to me. Harmony’s in Paris. You know that. I know that. She’s not missing. You want her to come home, I get that, but what would you have me do, fly to Paris and grab her?”

 

“She’s NOT in Paris!” Miss Lavoy shouted.

 

Gray pulled out his phone, pulled up a video, and showed it to her.

 

“She posted this TODAY. She’s been posting all week. Look. Freaking Eiffel Tower’s in the background. Why do you think she isn’t there?”

 

“Well maybe she is, but she doesn’t want to be. There’s just... Something’s wrong! You don’t get it! I can’t... You’re not her mother, you don’t know her.”

 

“When was the last time you spoke to your daughter?” I piped in. Gray shot me a look but didn’t say anything.

 

“Last time we spoke on the phone was a few days ago. It’s mostly texting with her.”

 

My interest was piquing. In what way could she be missing if she could take phone calls, return texts, and post vlogs? It sounded crazy but this woman didn’t seem crazy. Distressed, very much so, but not crazy.

 

“And in these interactions, did you notice anything strange?” I prodded.

 

“Well every time I’ve phoned her she hasn’t been able to talk long. She always says she’s busy and she ends the call quick. I call her later and she says she’s too tired. There’s always an excuse.”

 

“And the texts?”

 

“She’s just... normal. She tells me not to worry. She brushes it off, says it’s all fine.”

 

“So what exactly makes you think something’s wrong?”

 

“I just know! This whole trip was wrong. She never mentioned it to me until a few days before she left, and even then it was by text. I talked to her friends and they said the same thing. Nobody knew about this trip. It came out of nowhere. Then ever since she left it’s like I’m not even her mother anymore. She acts like I’m just another person. She tells me about where she goes and what she does – this restaurant, that restaurant, whatever – but it’s all just... nothing.”

 

“You think she’s hiding something?”

 

“She wouldn’t hide anything from me. That’s not the kind of person she is. This isn’t her. Whoever’s in those videos isn’t her.”

 

Gray stepped back into the conversation, “Why don’t we try calling her now, huh? We can all hash this out.”

 

“Yeah! I’ll call her up now, put her on speaker.” Miss Lavoy responded, pulling out her phone and dialing.

 

It rang and rang and there was no answer. She frowned as we looked on expectantly.

 

“Hang on let me try again.”

 

This time after a few rings, someone picked up.

 

“Hey mom.” A young woman’s voice answered.

 

“Hey sweetheart, are you alone right now?” Miss Lavoy asked.

 

“Uh, yeah, but I’m actually just about to-“

 

“Okay I’ve got some detectives with me here, and I need you to tell us what’s going on, alright sweetie?”

 

“What... What are you...” The voice on the phone stammered with embarrassment.

 

“Hey there Harmony.” Gray spoke into the phone. “Listen, your mother’s worried about you and we just wanna make sure everything’s good over there, alright?”

 

“Oh my gosh...” Harmony exclaimed with irritation. “Mom I told you everything’s fine! I don’t know what you’re so worried about! I promise I’m more than okay. I know I extended the trip, but I just wasn’t ready to leave yet! I’ll be home in just a few more days.”

 

“Harmony, are you sure nothing’s wrong? You have nothing to tell us?” I prodded.

 

“I’m so sorry about this. I promise there is nothing going on. I just wanted to go on a trip and see the world. My online business kind of took off so I got some money and it just felt like the right time. I’ve never left Nova Scotia before so it was a big step... Look I’m sorry, I gotta go. Is there anything else I can help you with?”

 

“No, that won’t be necessary, thank you.” I answered.

 

“I’ll see you soon, okay mom? I love you.” Harmony said before hanging up the phone.

 

Gray shrugged and threw up his hands, “So... She seems perfectly alright to me. You’re worried about your kid being far away from home, I get it. But everything seems fine here. There’s nothing for us to do.”

 

Evelyn just sighed deeply and shook her head. She was clearly trying to articulate some kind of protest but couldn’t find the words. Unfortunately for her, Gray was right. There was nothing for us to do. We left shortly after.

 

“What did I say about not talking?” Gray said as we walked back to the car. I had a feeling he would be sour about that.

 

“Sorry.” I remarked, not hiding my insincerity.

 

“Yeah, yeah. First day, already not taking orders. Good shit.”

 

“I wasn’t aware you were my superior.” I snipped. My impulses got the better of me.

 

Gray laughed. “Are you always this charming?”

 

“That depends, are you always a moody prick?” I may have overstepped.

 

Gray smiled through gritted teeth, “Let me let you in on a little secret, Cole. You know why you’re partnered with me? It aint cause we’re both “city folk.” It’s cause they don’t want you here. You can have your guess as to why that is, but that’s the fact. The sooner you figure that out and just quit, the better it’ll be for both of us.”

 

I suspected he was probably right about that. But it changed nothing.

 

“I’m not quitting.” I answered, getting into the passenger seat of his car.

 

Gray got in the driver’s seat and shot me a “we’ll see” look.

 

“You may want to reflect on why they thought making you someone’s partner would be the best way to make them quit.” I added.

 

“Oh I know why.” Gray answered. “Because I’m a moody prick.”

 

The rest of the day was uneventful and more than mildly unpleasant, but I felt better having had that little spat with Gray. At least we each knew where we stood. I got home to my dark basement apartment, relieved to be done with it for now.

 

Yet, I couldn’t stop thinking about the case. It was essentially closed after today, even though it had barely been open, but still it nagged at me. I had questions. I wanted to know more, I wanted to see more.

 

I unpacked my laptop and sat on my bed. I pulled up all of Harmony’s online profiles just to see if I could find anything. I wasn’t the most social media savvy person in the world, but I had to have a look.

 

The first thing that jumped out at me was the number of followers. Gray wasn’t kidding when he said she had a big following. She was in the high tens of thousands, encroaching upon the hundred. For a small town girl, that must have been quite impressive.

 

On the phone she mentioned an online business. I had a feeling of what that meant based on how awkwardly she said it in the presence of her mother. Her public profiles made no mention of it, but a minute amount of sleuthing led me to alternate profiles. Instantly adorned in racier photos. Links in the description to various Not Safe For Work subscription services. Pinned posts detailing the content she offered. Fair play to her. I wondered how she broached the subject with her mom. Her mom seems a more uptight and conservative type. It wouldn’t surprise me one bit if she kept this side of her a secret.

 

My new initial thought was that this Paris trip wasn’t just a vacation and it was instead some kind of collaboration. She networked with other NSFW creators, and went down there to make more content for her fans. That explains the shifty behavior, she obviously didn’t want her mother to know. That all adds up. Case closed.

 

But I wanted to try one more thing. Just to dot the I’s and cross the t’s. Directly compare a vlog from Paris with one made before. See if there were any discrepancies in her behavior or anything else that might indicate some kind of change. I chose the first vlog from Paris, and a random one from a month earlier with a similar thumbnail.

 

To my naked eye, the videos themselves looked innocuous enough. Her mood and attitude appeared the same. I moved to the descriptions and they were both formatted similarly. She replied to a few comments and spoke the same way on each. Similar verbiage, use of punctuation (she likes using double hyphens and the letter u instead of you) it all seemed to check out. Location services confirmed Paris as the location of the post, as if my eyes weren’t enough to see. It was airtight.

 

I went through a few more of her videos, at this point just because I had nothing better to do. It was all relatively the same. Talking to the camera. Sightseeing. Standard stuff. She spent one of the nights in Belgium, that was mildly eventful I suppose.

 

Videos before the trip were similarly standard. Some unboxing videos, some trends, some general vlogs. It wasn’t really my scene, but I could see why people liked it. There was a coziness to it. The crude comments gave me some insight into the ulterior appeal of it as well. She was, after all, very pretty. I was a bit envious of her blue eyes. They were very bright blue and piercing, almost hypnotic. Mine were closer to her mother’s, a dark greenish hazel.

 

Harmony seemed like a happy person. Always smiling, always chipper. I couldn’t help but feel it was a bit hollow. Which I can understand, it’s a social media persona. You play it up for the fans. Though there was a sincerity in her older videos that I felt was lacking in the Paris ones. Maybe the passion wasn’t there anymore, who knows.

 

All I knew was it was time for me to go to bed. This case was closed. It was time to empty my mind of it and prepare for the next thing Gray would drag me to.

 

The second day on the job in Greenwood went by monotonously. The case load in Toronto versus the case load here couldn’t have been more different. In Toronto we had plenty of local police to handle the small things so we could focus on the multitude of larger, more dangerous issues. Greenwood only had us, but also Greenwood only had about 5,000 people.

 

Gray wasn’t much less unpleasant this day either. He gave me shit about just about everything. I worked on remaining stoic to the best of my power. I wasn’t sure if he hated me, if it amused him trying to get a rise out of me, if he was trying to make me quit, or if it was just his personality. Either way, I would ignore it and carry on with the mundanity.

 

It wasn’t until the day after that something else noteworthy happened. More than noteworthy, in fact. It was still early in the morning. A call came in about a disturbance at the local soup kitchen. They said a homeless man was causing a scene. Raving and ranting, and waving a knife around. Gray and I were close, dealing with a petty larceny – far below my pay grade, but such is the job. We went to the scene.

 

“Blessings” was written in blue italics on a white banner hanging on the front of a rickety little building that was also painted white. There were crosses on the windows. It looked like a house or a small school that had been refurbished and repurposed. Such was the case for many places around here.

 

The shouting was audible from outside, as were the sounds of metal clattering. We made our way inside swiftly.

 

A raggedy older man stood with his back to the near corner of the cafeteria seating. He held a butcher’s knife out at arm’s length, god knows how he got it, while the terrified volunteer staff circled him from a distance with their palms out, attempting to show that they mean him no harm. His eyes were bloodshot and bugged out. He was screaming nonsense.

 

Gray and I took control of the room. I stepped out in front of the staff while Gray backed them off. I looked the man in his bulging eyes, attempting to decipher his words before offering my own.

 

“It’s in me! It’s in me! They poison me!” He screamed.

 

“Sir, I don’t think anyone’s poisoning you. Let’s put down the knife, okay? Let’s talk.”

 

“NO! They want me to do it, but I won’t do it! No more! It’s the bees stinging my brain! They all serve the queen! I won’t be their bee! They can sting and sting! They can suck the pollen out! They can eat me like a bug, but I won’t! No more poison! Burn it all! Melt it all!”

 

I’ve heard some insane rambling in my time but that was up there. I needed him to calm down.

 

“What is your name?” I shouted through his babbling.

 

“My... My name? You want my name!? Why!?”

 

“Because I want to talk. That’s all. Just talk. What’s your name?”

 

“It’s... It’s Melvin.”

 

“Okay, Melvin. I’m Detective Cole. Now I need you to take a breath. You don’t want to hurt anybody, do you?”

 

“No... No... I don’t want to hurt anybody.” He said shakily. I took one slow step towards him and he allowed it without protest.

 

“Good. So just give me the knife, and we can figure this out. I can’t help you if you’re pointing a knife at me, you understand?”

 

“It’s not me... it’s them! It’s everyone! Soon it’ll be everyone! Melting in the dark! I see it! I see the horns of Satan himself, but it’s a lie!”

 

“Melvin, deep breath.” I instructed. “I want to help you but, see, I’m new here. I’m from the city. So I don’t know what you mean when you say these things. Can you just hand me the knife and then explain everything to me calmly?”

 

Melvin didn’t budge, but his hand shook and he began to sob. “You don’t understand... An eye for an eye... The window is open... The father...”

 

“I’m sorry?”

 

“And the girl... she’s not missing.”

 

Those words caught my attention for some reason. They were too specific. Too directed.

 

“The girl?” I asked.

 

“She’s not missing... but she’s gone.”

 

“Who? What do you mean?”

 

“One eye missing, one eye gone. One eye open, two eyes closed, third eye open. Melting, melting, melting, melting...” He raved in manic whispers.

 

“Melvin...”

 

“Won’t be me. Won’t be me. Pluck it out. Stop the sting. Drink, drink, drink. He’s coming here, I’ll go there. He’ll walk again, but not in skin. Never skin. The holes don’t have eyes but they will. They will be his not hers. Hers will be missing but she will be gone. Gone from her skin. Lost in her eye.”

 

“Melvin, look at me.” I said, taking another slow step forward.

 

Melvin did as I asked and stared into my eyes. He took a deep breath and uttered “I now belong to Candle Caine.”

 

In one frantic motion, he turned the knife to his own throat and closed his eyes tight.

 

“Don’t!” I shouted as I sprinted towards him, but it was too late.

 

He plunged the knife into his throat. Instantly blood poured and belched out from the wound. I did what I could, but it was in deep. All the way to the hilt. He shook, convulsed, and gurgled. Then he was gone, and it was quiet. The worst kind of quiet.

 

The ambulance came and took his body. Gray and I stuck around to take care of the traumatized patrons and staff. A man came up and introduced himself as the owner, Mr. Whitley. An older, gangly sort of man with a wisp of white hair. We questioned him briefly.

 

“Did Melvin come around here often?” Gray asked.

 

“Yeah... Yeah he did, he was one of our regulars. Never seen him act like... I mean... I don’t know...” Whitley said, in a somber shellshock.

 

“Did you know much about him? Did he have family here or anything?”

 

“He used to always talk about his niece, Annabelle... I don’t think she lived around here though. He didn’t like to talk about himself much. I imagine he just fell on hard times. It’s rough out there, you know?”

 

“Oh, that I know. For sure. I mean, shit, I wish I had a place like this back in the day.” Gray remarked, probably trying to quell the dread.

 

“Well... It’s just Greenwood hospitality I guess.” Whitley responded humbly.

 

“Yeah, New York hospitality is a little different... But for real, I admire what you do, lookin’ out for people. You take care now. Call if anything else comes to mind.”

 

Gray definitely had a way with people. A charm, and a disarming sort of charisma. So antithetical to the asshole he usually was.

 

We stepped outside and took in some air. The silence lingered for a while before he spoke.

 

“First time seeing someone die?” He asked.

 

“No...” I answered.

 

“Well... You did alright, kid. Don’t beat yourself up.”

 

The word ‘kid’ aside, that was by far the nicest thing he said to me thus far.

 

“The way he was acting... The things he said...” I thought out loud.

 

“Fucking nuts.”

 

“Yeah but... I’ve seen manic episodes, schizophrenia, delusions, bad trips... I’ve dealt with lots of those in Toronto. This felt different... And what is Candle Caine? Have you ever heard of that?”

 

“No idea. Sounds like a high school mascot or somethin’... Maybe he was trying to say ‘candy cane’...”

 

“That wouldn’t really make sense in context though...”

 

Gray dismissively snorted, “What fucking context, Cole? The man was out of it. He was gone. He stuck a knife in his jugular, that’s the context.”

 

“So that’s it? You don’t even want to look into it? You don’t wanna do your job?” I snipped.

 

“Oh fuck off. We’ll look into it. I’m just sayin’... You know last month there was a graverobbing over in Meadowvale. Just a random, old, unmarked grave. They still don’t know who did it or why, they don’t know dick all. Last I checked they didn’t even know who the fuck the grave belonged to. All they know is some freak dug up a skeleton.”

 

“Okay, why are you telling me this?”

 

“Because sometimes people do weird shit. Sometimes it doesn’t make sense and it never will and we just have to be okay with that. I’m not saying don’t do your job, I’m just saying be prepared to not tie it all in a fucking bow.” Gray explained.

 

I rolled my eyes. To me it just sounded like laziness.

 

“Hey.” A frail and solemn voice called out from down the sidewalk. Another scruffy looking man with an overgrown beard approached us, visibly a few years younger. “Fran told me what happened to Melvin, I was just on my way here... You’re the cops? You saw it all?”

 

“Yeah...” I answered. “Did you know him?”

 

“We... We played cribbage... Nobody else knew how to play. They call it an old person game... He won almost every time. I beat him one time, just one... He was my friend...”

 

“I’m sorry.”

 

“He wouldn’t have... He wasn’t... Ugh... He was saving up. He was gonna buy his niece a gift for her 7th birthday. I kept tellin’ him “you use that money for yourself, you idiot.” But he was so excited, he was clean, it was the first birthday of her life he could actually buy her something... He wouldn’t just...”

 

“He sounds like he was a good man...” I said. It was hard to stifle my heartache upon hearing that.

 

“He was... I’m sorry... Are you okay?”

 

“Me? Yeah. Yeah I’m okay.” I said, taken slightly aback by the man’s consideration. “Are you?”

 

The man let out a deep sigh. “Yeah... It just don’t make sense...”

 

He was right... it didn’t. He walked away, his head hung. I felt for him. This part is never easy. You always wish for the right sequence of words to make it a little bit better, but most of the time no such words exist. You just have to watch as peoples’ worlds crumble, and try to feel secure on the knowledge that you did all you could, even if your brain constantly tells you otherwise.

 

There was a constant urge to dehumanize tragedy, to make it easier to manage. It helps with the job, and it helps life in general not be so crushing. But sometimes the humanity of it all just smacks you in the face. Today was one of those days. Gray and I left shortly after, but I couldn’t get it out of my head. Any of it. It lingered in the air.

 

The girl isn’t missing... I couldn’t help but think of Harmony, but we already knew she wasn’t missing. We knew where she was, and I had a good idea of why she was there. There was no case. He must have meant someone else... but who? And what the hell was Candle Caine?",1,1744644365.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1jz1jrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1jz1jrq/fat_city_1972_an_emotional_and_impactful_film/,Fat City (1972) — An Emotional and Impactful Film That Deserves More Love,"This is my first time doing a film write-up or contributing to this sub. I’m definitely not as eloquent or knowledgeable about film or proper terminology as a lot of y’all, but I wanted to give it a shot just for fun.

Fat City is an absolute gem that I never hear talked about.

I can’t believe there’s a sports movie this good that I had not only never seen, but never even heard of (not that you need to have any interest in boxing or sports to enjoy it). It kind of feels like it’s been lost to time, for whatever reason.

I was really impressed by how well-made this movie is, and how real and visceral the environment of Stockton and the world of low-level professional boxing felt. Everything was shot beautifully and I felt immersed in every scene. I could practically smell the sweat and booze in those dive bars. I could feel the monotony of catching the same bus every day to go work the onion fields for a couple bucks. I could feel the heat, the exhaustion, the quiet desperation. I could feel the tension building in the scene where Tully is trying to cook dinner for Oma — the ketchup bottle shattering, the peas spilling onto the floor, her constant picking and yelling — it was claustrophobic and raw. As he storms out of the apartment, we feel it too — the tension is so overwhelming and the space so suffocating that we want out just as badly as he does.

The film isn’t showy about this either — the pacing is slow and really has this slice of life and authentic monotony. It just lets you sit in that world, and it’s incredibly effective.

The performances were fantastic. Stacy Keach was completely believable as Tully — it’s a great character study, of a man who once seemed to have a promising future and is now stuck in a depressing cycle that he can't seam to break. He want's more out of life, he wants what he had when he was younger, but he just can't get off the path he's on. As great as Keach was, as far as performances go, Susan Tyrrell was the standout for me. Her depiction of an unstable, alcoholic woman — the manic mood swings from being sickly in love, to angry, to full of sorrow — was incredible. She was so captivating and stole every scene she was in, it feels like the kind of performance that could be studied in film school. I can see why she got an Academy Award nomination. There were a lot of great performances in this movie, but hers was special.

Another standout aspect for me was the relationship between Ernie and Faye. Their scenes were so charming, awkward, funny, and emotionally honest. The film captures what it's like to be young and inexperienced in love and relationships — trying to figure each other out, not quite saying what you mean, asking loaded questions without revealing too much. Their dynamic felt incredibly authentic and relatable, like something everyone can recognize from their own lives and youth.

And then there’s the ending which was so strong and impactful in capturing the depressing realities of life and the film. There’s no “Rocky” style ending where Tully has his triumphant return to glory. He fights — his first bout in two years — gets back into shape, gets thrown in against someone he's not ready for and he still pulls off a huge underdog win. And yet… life goes on the same as it did before. Nothing has changed. He's not happy, he’s not triumphant. He didn’t even realize he won. He doesn't go out celebrating. He doesn't get his wife back. He doesn't get his career back. He’s still a mess, he’s still a drunk, he’s still bitter and alone.

The final scene at the coffee shop with Ernie is perfect. It's so quiet and unassuming but hits so heavy emotionally. Tully sits with the kid he inspired to start boxing at the start of the film, their lives now in total contrast. Ernie is fresh off a win, his career is on the rise, he's young, he has a wife, he has a family, he has future... everything Tully once has and no longer does. As Ernie tries repeatedly to go home, Tully clings on, urging him to stay and talk. Ernie has everything waiting for him when he walks out the door and Tully has nothing. It really is a gut punch.

The final exchange between Tully and Ernie — the last dialogue of the film — is so quick and unassuming, yet delivers one final, quietly devastating statement. After the old man brings them their coffee, Tully says to Earnie, ""Would you believe he was young once?"" Earnie replies, ""No."" Tully responds, ""Maybe he wasn’t."" This is such a great bit of writing. They see this old man and can't imagine him as anything other than he is now. Ernie is young and living the dream, Tully's youth is fading and his dreams have slipped away, and the waiter is much older. Tully sees him as someone who ""was never young"" — meaning never happy, never fulfilled, never really lived. I think that in this moment, Ernie represents Tully's past, which has just about slipped away, and the waiter represents his fear of aging and a bleak future. Will he end up becoming the old man, who was ""never young""?

Overall, I think what makes the film so powerful and effective is its tone and realism. Nothing is overly glorified — which is an easy trap in sports films — and nothing is overly dramatized either. Huston keeps everything grounded. You don’t need to be a boxer, or from Stockton, to relate. Everyone’s experienced the monotony of life. Everyone’s felt stuck. Everyone’s wrestled with time slipping through their fingers. Fat City captures that beautifully and tragically.

Ending is so small and quiet. It’s not grand in a good way or some devastating blow. It’s not sad in some devastating final blow kind of way. It’s not like Tully loses a big fight and you have some shot of him laying bloodied and battered on the canvas. He won his last, fight he’s out having a coffee with his friend, yet it’s so sad in just a very quiet and realistic way. 

Curious to hear other's thoughts on the film as well :)",4,1744644191.0,TrueFilm,2,1.0,False

1jz1ip7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jz1ip7/date_went_well_but_he_said_he_wasnt_feeling_it/,Date went well but he said he wasnt feeling it?,"Ok so, let me just preface this by saying I'm a 32F and have never had a guy not want a second date. I'm not trying to sound arrogant, I just usually get along with most people, have been told all my life I'm attractive/pretty/sexy and guys try to get in my pants left and right, so I think I'm doing OK in the looks department. I take care of my figure, eat healthy, workout, and always make sure to look my best when I go out because I just believe if you look good, you feel good. I also am a real estate agent and in our business, you never know if you're gonna meet a potential client so it's good to always look put together.  

I've been online dating since 2020 and have been on lots of dates, and even ones that I thought weren't that great or I wasn't into the guy, the guy always wanted a second date. I know this is toxic, but usually they at least want to try and get in my pants. Not saying that's a good thing, but that's usually a given. Most of the guys I've dated have been in their late 20s, not for any particular reason, it just seems to work out that way. But I've also been on dates with men I didn't meet online who were in their 40s and even one is his early 50s. I'm not closed minded about age, I've been with men 20 years older than me of several years younger. For most of 2021-end of 2024, I was in a FWB type relationship with a man in his late 40s. 

So fast forward to a few weeks ago, I match with a guy on bumble who's 40, looking for a LTR, and lives not too far (about 35 min) from me, but in a part of town I go to often and am very familiar with. We seemed to hit it off right away texting on bumble, and after only a day he asked if I wanted to come up to his town and hang out, get a coffee or drink, and see some live music since we're both really into music, and both play instruments. I thought it was a little odd that he didn't offer to meet me half way or somewhere closer to me, because that's usually what guys do, but I love the town he lives in so I was cool with it. We met up yesterday at 6 pm at a restaurant but I could tell he didn't really want to get food and I just got the strong sense that he didn't really want to spend money. We got two apps and one drink each. We had a lot in common, same political views, liked the same music, and the conversation flowed and we finished each other's sentences and pretty much agreed on everything, and were laughing a lot. There was a noisy table that got sat near where we were sitting and I could tell he wanted to leave, so I said you wanna get out of here? Thinking he'd want to maybe get a drink at one of the many bars to walk to, but instead he wanted to just take a walk. It was still chilly and dark at this point so I thought that was a little odd, and again, strongly got the feeling he didn't want to spend money. He took me on this weird walk behind the main street and all the buildings, along a creek, which I'm sure would be lovely on a summer day, but it rained all weekend, was so dark he had to use his phone flashlight, and very muddy and hard to navigate. I just thought that wasn't very appropriate or accommodating for a first date,but I'm open and didn't say anything and enjoyed just talking to him. 
He mentioned having to be up early for work so he walked me back to my car, and on the way asked if I'd ever come up earlier like on a Saturday so we can spend more time and go to more places there and I said yes. The only reason we made our date Sunday was because the weather sucked Friday and Saturday and he wanted to be able to walk around. I get the strong feeling that he doesn't have a car and kept talking  about things being expensive and making comments about rich people. Again, I'm open minded so I was willing to meet him again and learn more about him. He told me ""text me when you get home safe"" and I realized we never exchanged numbers so I gave him my business card and just said ""here you can just text me and so you have my number"". He hugged me and I left. 

I got home to him messaging me on bumble (guess he really didn't want me to have his number lol) saying ""it was great to meet you, I had a great time and you're really cool! It was great to meet a level headed conservative woman for once! I'm not really feeling it though ☹️ but it was great to meet you! And if I ever decide to buy a house, I know who to call lol"" 

I was honestly really taken aback because I thought the date went way better than a lot of dates I've been on, and I've never had a guy not want a second date. So I'm just wondering what happened?? I actually messaged him back and said like ""hey I'm a bit taken aback bc I thought the date went well and when you asked me if I'd ever come up to see you earlier in the day, that lead me to belive you thought the same. Is there something I did? Just want to know for my future endeavors lol"" and I got no response back so I unmatched with him. And just for the record, we were both conservative politically (please everyone don't turn this into a political argument, I'm only stating that for context), and he kept complaining about how it's so hard to find conservative women and how most women are liberals who end up hating him for being conservative. Politics are a deal breaker for me so I try to only date men who are on the same page, and pretty much every conservative man I've been out with usually wants to hang out again bc it is hard for them to find women who share their views. So that part just made it all the more shocking to me. 

I know everyone will probably say like, maybe he just didn't feel a spark, don't take it personally, etc, and all good advice but this is the first time this has happened to me so I'm just looking for more insight lol. Thank you in advance! ",1,1744644118.0,dating_advice,22,1.0,False

Idk I just want to tell a bunch of people about us bc I’m so falling in love and it feels so good. 😭
I was friends with this guy for 7 years. He lives in a different state but we always kept in touch. 3 months ago the convo started getting slightly flirty and we just went with it and it grew and grew. Now we’re like, falling in love. We haven’t discussed that but it’s obvious to me.

He texts me gm and gn everyday and we talk on and off throughout the entire day. We haven’t gone one day without talking since we got flirty. He’s SO handsome and SO sweet. He has the face of an angel and has really hot tattoos 😭 like this is the hottest guy I’ve ever been with in any capacity. I’m an attractive woman but have never prioritized looks at all and tbh my past two relationships (both long term) were with kinda conventionally unattractive men. HAHA. Like I found them attractive after getting to know them but no one else really get it. But not anymore like he’s stunning, and it’s cool to experience being so physically attracted to someone along with the non physical. He’s a feminist, too, so no weird gender role things and we talk about women’s rights issues and I feel heard. He shows me so much respect and concern and he’s SO attentive and kind. He’s so nurturing. He also has a big YOU KNOW WHAT ;) and actually goes down on me. My last two relationships never had me receiving oral. I’m in heaven. We also have an extremely intense sexual attraction and we’re both comfortable enough to admit that we touch ourselves to thoughts of us. And he even admitted to masturbating to pics I send him exclusively. It made me feel so good and flattered! He’s sooo physically affectionate and loves loving on me which I’ve never experienced to this degree, and it’s so great to feel adored like this. I catch him looking at me so sweet; just watching me do whatever not saying a word, and he takes cute candids of me when I’m not watching. For example, he took an adorable photo from behind when I was playing his piano and I didn’t even know he was watching. And I just thought it was really sweet. He cooks and bakes for me. He gets up before me and brings me coffee in bed. He got me playing fortnite which I now love, so that we can have an activity to do from afar while we’re long distance. Like….he thought of that for us. And it’s so much fun! 


I really hope we end up being exclusive. This is the only guy I’ve ever fantasized about maybe even having a baby with. I want to marry him. I’ve never even been sure of that before. Never felt it with anyone else. These are things that I’ve never really, really wanted before but I do with him. I’m so scared of messing it up. Sometimes I feel like I get too over enthusiastic and lovey dovey and my trauma and past issues bring up fear of abandonment when I do that, but he’s never once pulled away or done anything but reciprocate. 


The only thing I’m worried about is that he just got out of a 13 year relationship. They’ve been broken up for about a year. I guess I’m just worried he will take her back if she ever wants to, or that maybe he wants to not commit for awhile because he wants to enjoy being single for once in his true adult life, but so far everything has been perfect. And I have no real reason to believe those things will happen. Also the long distance. I’ve never done it before and I worry about it, but we see eachother for 3-5 days every month, so at least we have that. Worrying about those things is likely all my anxiety but you never know. For now I’m trying so hard not to worry about that stuff and enjoy this beautiful feeling. This is the kind of love I wish for those I love the most. It’s a wonderful thing and I hope everyone gets to experience it at least once. 💖

1jz1hm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1jz1hm6/dance_classes_in_south_korea_2025/,Dance Classes in South Korea 2025,"Posting this as i'm currently visiting South Korea and have been taking some dance classes. I struggled to find info about how each studio operates, and as someone who gets a tad stressed out by these things and likes to be prepared, i thought I'd put everything I've found out here and it might help some fellow dancers out!

1Million Dance Studio:

Class Timetable- You can find their monthly timetable on their website and app.

Booking- To book you need to set up an account, which from what i can remember was super easy, just an email and phone number. From there, you need to purchase 'class passes/tickets', they do these individually and in bundles which can work out cheaper. My advice would be to do this in person at the studio as the paypal conversion fee to pay online makes it very expensive. Once you have your passes, if you're already at the studio you can just ask them to book you onto the class you want at the counter, or if you're on the web or app you can select the class you want to book onto there!

Queue/ pre-class- At 1Million the queueing system is usually done with bottles/ personal items. When you arrive for your class, check which studio you're in (there's one on each floor, It will say on the app/web timetable), and head there. Outside the studio you will probably see that some people have already started to leave their bottles etc in a line outside the door, this is to reserve the spot in the queue so they can get a good spot near the front. You can add your item to the line and then just chill out before class starts. If it's a popular class and you want a good spot I would recommend getting there early.

If you have already booked class online, you don't need to speak to reception you can just go and wait for your class.

Also before class you will want to leave your bag/coat in one of the lockers outside the studio, they have these on both floors, people usually take just their phones and water in with them.

Class entry- About 5 mins before class a staff member will call everyone over and line you up ready to go in, so find your bottle and get into your space. To enter the studio you will need to show the QR code that is linked to your 1Million account, I recommend getting the app and it's the button on the top right of the home page. They will scan your code, then you're ready to enjoy your class!

Amenities- They have toilets and changing facilities on both floors in the building, plenty of seating, and lockers as mentioned. They have a vending machine with water but I haven't managed to find a water fountain (if anyone knows where it is please help lol)

Other- It's around a 5 minute walk from seongsu station, the area is really nice and has lots of convenience stores and coffee and food shops around.

Urban Play Dance:

Class Timetable- You can find their monthly timetable on their website and daily timetable on their instagram.

Booking- To book online you need to fill out a google docs form from their website (under pre-registration books), this is all in korean but easy to translate with papago. They offer single class tickets and also multiple. To pay you can either pay via bank transfer (to the details at the top of the form),or by card on site, but again i find it easier to pay in person on site. You then will be asked to select which class you want to go too and submit the form. It's also easy to just book and pay in person at the studios, I would recommend doing this unless its for a class that could potentially sell out.

Queue/ Pre class- If you've booked and paid online you still need to speak to the reception staff to sign in and they will tell you what studio you will be in. There isn't really a queueing system at Urban Play, more just whoever gets into the studio first. If you're hoping for a good spot, again get there early and stand outside the studio door.

They have shelves outside each studio for you to leave your bag and coat on before entering the studio.

Class entry- Once the class before comes out, you're fine to enter the studio.

Amenities- They have two changing cubicles on the reception floor and a water fountain. Ws toilets are on the reception floor just outside the reception area and ms toilets are on the floor above.

Other- It's around a 10 minute walk from Sadang station. I'm not too familiar with this area, but you pass lots of convenience stores etc on the walk to the studio.

MID Dance Academy:

Class Timetable- You can find the regular class schedule on their website and pop up class schedule on instagram.

Booking- Booking for each class opens at 5pm the day before. You need to fill out a booking form (You can find it on the homepage of the website, scroll down and select 'a class reservation'), fill out the form accordingly, selecting how you would like to pay and which class you'd like to attend. Again I would recommend paying onsite. They also offer single class tickets and multiple ticket options.

Queue/ Pre class- How quickly you book onto class via the form determines the order of entry, the closer to the class start time you book the further back you will be in the queue. Regardless of whether you paid online or in person you need to sign in at reception otherwise you will be let in last. They will call your names out to enter the class.

They have shelves outside the studio to leave your belongings and a water fountain.

Amenities- The toilets are shared with other spaces in the building and you need a code to enter, these are on signs posted around the studio space. As for changing area i'm not sure as i haven't really looked out for one, sorry.

Other- Around a 10 min walk from Ewha womens univ station/ sincheon station. Lots of convenience stores and restaurants nearby.

JustJerk Academy (Ewha Branch):

Class Timetable- You can find the monthly timetable on instagram and website.

Booking- Booking can only be made in person at the studio from 4pm on the day of the class. When I went for the first time they asked for my passport to set up my account with them. The earlier in the day you book onto the class the earlier you will be in the queue. After you have paid at reception they will give you a number card that tells you where you are in the queue, after you have this you're free to leave and come back closer to class time. They also offer single class tickets or to buy multiple class passes.

Queue/ Pre class- Around 10 minutes before class they will ask you to line up before according to the number card given to you when you booked class earlier in the day.

You can leave your belongings outside the studio in the reception area. No drinks are allowed in the studio at all, even bottled water.

Amenities- They have 2 changing rooms, not sure on toilets as i've only been once. I saw a vending machine with drinks in and i'm not sure about if they have a water fountain.

Other- Around a 10 min walk from Ewha womens univ station/ sincheon station. Lots of convenience stores and restaurants nearby.

Project Lee Dance Academy:

Class Timetable- This is a new studio and at the moment it's easier to find the monthly timetable on their instagram.

Booking- You can book through the rawgraphy app thats linked in their instagram bio. However for foreigners this isn't possible unless you have a arc or registration card to be able to bank transfer. The system is similar to MID, booking opens 2 days before class at 5pm and the sooner you book the closer you are to the front of the queue. This studio also offers either single class tickets or to purchase multiple at once.

You can book in person on the day of the class at the studio, this does mean that you will be at the bottom of the queue. Unfortunately this means that at the moment unless you are a permanent resident you will be at the bottom of the queue.

Queue/ Pre class- Before class you need to check in at reception and they will tell you what group you are in for class entry. Then when class is about to start, they will call out the groups to enter one at a time in order.

There are shelves and seating where you can leave your belongings before class.

Amenities- There is a water fountain, toilets are shared with other floors in the building and I didnt see a changing room but I have only been once so there could be one.

Other- About a 10 min walk from Hongik univ station. Lots of convenience stores and restaurants nearby.

Overall, every studio I've been to has been very helpful and most receptions are able to guide and help you in english if you need.

This is all info that i've gathered from my experiences over the last few weeks, of course if i have gotten anything wrong or you have other helpful advice please let me know and i can add it to the post.

I really hope this is of some help! :)",2,1744644044.0,koreatravel,2,1.0,False

First of all good morning. I’m (F18) and I wanted to talk about an experience I’ve been feeling recently. I might delete this soon because I’m just too scared to have this up for long on my profile.

4 years ago in middle school I didn’t have any friends, genuinely none. So I turned to online media. 

I cannot. For the LIFE of me remember how I ended up there. But I was involve in a server that was highly predatory and very much knew my age at the time. (14-15) I would frequent with these people daily because they were the closest thing I had to friends or any comfort. Discord got shifted to Vrchat and shortly after I found a group that pulled me out of that situation. They helped me heal. 

But after 2 years of their friendship. I had a falling out with one person of the group members and the entire group turned on me. I was sent so many hateful dms and a public post announcement was made saying that I deserved everything that had happened to me during middle school.  

I haven’t been able to pick up my headset, I have to keep it in a separate room or I’ll cry. I’ve tried holding the controllers but my body shook it off of me. I hate this feeling. I still have really good online friends I met from the game, but even talking with them makes my stomach puke because I’m just so scared I’ll end up back where I used to be. 

I’ve been diagnosed with ptsd. But my therapy experience has been sooo choppy. I’ve only now just got back into it with a new therapist. 

Okay. Now here’s what had happened. One time i told my experience to a group of friends while we were getting coffee, and they said I was misusing the term because what happened to me wasn’t physical. And because I never shared photos or was forced to it wasn’t as terrible as others having it and to not be insensitive. 

I can’t get that interaction out of my head. I need other opinions. 

Ps. if anyone else had any other similar experiences or emotions, what small things/habits did you try that really helped? I could really use a tip or two. 

I really don’t know what other community to go to. Everyone else I talk to about this at school literally struggles to understand what I feel. I don’t know anyone else who’s had similar struggles like ptsd. It feels sickening and alienating.

The interview process was tough - behavioral rounds, a case study, and a final interview where I had to outline how I’d manage multiple projects at once. It made the job sound fast-paced, and a little intimidating.

But today, I’m sitting in my home at 10.30am, sipping coffee, staring at my calendar, and realizing I have… nothing urgent to do. Again.

My first month was crazy. I set up project timelines, created dashboards for tracking, and streamlined how our team updated weekly reports. My manager was impressed and called me a “genius” because I set up automated reminders for overdue tasks.

Then things slowed down. Once the initial setup was done, my daily workload shrank to some emails, occasional check-in meetings, and “urgent” requests.

For meetings, I barely pay attention. I recommend people to start using AI (granola) to summarize and get action items. My 50-year-old director called me a “techie” for doing that. Man, I don’t even like tech that much.

Last week, my manager asked if I remembered a decision we made two months ago - I typed a keyword into my second brain setup (saner) and had the answer for him right away. And he asked me whether I have “photographic memory”. Sir, I don’t even remember my friends’ birthday.

Most of my time is now spent appearing busy. I keep a detailed GDoc page open during Zoom calls so it looks like I’m working hard

I schedule slack message to send later in the days, while I actually finished them in maybe, 20 minutes

Sometimes, I feel guilty about how little I actually do.

I’ve picked up hobbies. I’ve learned to make fresh pasta. Started decorating my house. I’ve read more books this year than in the last two combined.

Every now and then, I panic that my manager will catch on and fire me during these silent layoffs, but last week, she told me I’m doing “an incredible job keeping everything on track.” So… I guess I’ll just keep doing what I’m doing?

1jz1fvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1jz1fvn/i_called_in_every_favour_ive_built_over_a_decade/,"📽️ I called in every favour I’ve built over a decade to make my first short film, LURE — we shot it on favors and coffee, and now it’s finally here. Would love your thoughts!","Hey everyone,  
After years of working on other people’s projects, building relationships, and quietly dreaming about this—I finally made my first proper horror short. It’s called *Lure*, and I’d love for you to watch it and give any feedback, if possible.

This was a concept short for a feature I’ve already written, and it's inspired by my love for the modern evolution of horror—think Eggers, A24 stuff like that which Id watch on repeat in my teen years. God I love the VVitch.

*Lure* tells the story of a tormented father who lives in solitude, waiting for the man who once saved his sons life. But the truth he’s been avoiding is far darker than he could ever imagine...

We shot the whole thing at my family cottage in northern Ontario. Right on Pigeon Lake for all of my Kawartha lake fans. I directed, wrote, and produced it myself, and we made it happen with nothing but favours and coffee. Literally. No budget, just a crew of people I’ve helped on countless sets over the years, who showed up when I finally asked for their help.

One of those people was my childhood mentor. I will leave out his name but he looks like Steve Tyler, no joke. I met him in high school. I was actually in detention for having the grand gift of distracting others in class; when a supply teacher who knew I loved films came up to me and said that he has a friend who makes movies and could use my help. That led me to reaching out to 'Steve Tyler' and asked if he needed any help on his shoots. Well he respnded and brought me on his set when I was 16, and taught me everything about film before I even got to film school. We've been like family ever since. Honestly, without him, none of this happens.

We had our fair share of madness on set, at one point we were set to shoot exteriors around a lit campfire and it *was pouring* rain up until ten minutes before we rolled. I told the crew it would stop, and they looked at me like I was nuts. But right at 7 PM, like on cue, it cleared. We were rolling. It was magic.

My dream is to turn this short into the full-length feature, which I’ve already written. The story for that is; secluded in an old family cottage, a tormented father attempts to unravel the mystery of his son's disappearance as dark forces prey on his sanity. At its heart, Lure (feature) is a uniquely twisted re-imagining of ***The Binding of Isaac*** for a modern audience.The Old Testament depicts Abraham, charged by God, to sacrifice his only son to prove his faith. In our tale, we beg the question;

*What if it wasn't God, who was asking?*

I’d really love to know what you think of the short. Does the tone land? Would you want to see the feature version? Any and all feedback is gold and beyond helpful.

Thanks for reading and for being the kind of community where people like me can share this kind of dream-come-true stuff. It means the world.

For a little background, i've been diagnosed with adhd type C. I am on a shared care agreement with Psychiatry. 

20mg didn't really do a huge amount, i noticed less racing thoughts, more emotionally regulated but i felt so exhausted all of the time and noticed it was only lasting 4ish hours. 

4 days ago, i moved up to 40mg which has been quite an experience. The first day i felt like i had taken something and i was so all over the place the entire day, I had the shakes, couldn't eat, blurry vision and very dry mouth (which i was expecting with a dose change). 2nd day felt similar to 20mg but just more energy? and then the last two days i feel wired and i feel like i can't function properly? I'm definitely able to concentrate more but i feel more scatty and I also will not stop yapping and although i feel wired, i can't actually bring myself to do anything. 

Once the meds wear off i then feel incredibly anxious, i have zero energy and i feel so groggy but the meds are lasting a lot longer than the 20mg. 

I know the adjustment period can make you feel this way but i just wanted to find out other people's experiences and if they have had this? I just feel like i have taken speed (never had it but i imagine this is how it feels). Is it too soon to know if i'm on too high of a dose? It's putting me off wanting to go up to 60mg in a few days. 

I just wondered if anyone else had this experience and if it got any better once your body adjusted? I am eating something with higher protein in with my medication and drinking just water through the day - only on the odd occasion i will have a decaf coffee. I am also sleeping great so can't see that impacting anything. 

feel free to leave any advice too - i feel like it's quite a isolating experience because nobody i know really understands, so just wanted an insight into other people's experiences :)",1,1744643892.0,ADHDUK,2,1.0,False

Our plan is as follows:

Day 1 - Arenal Volcano / 1968 hike, eat lunch at cafe, coffee + chocolate tour (Don Juan or Northfield we heard was recommended)

Day 2 - La Fortuna Waterfall, Mistico Hanging Bridges

Day 3 - White water rafting in the morning (any recs?), second half of day spend at Tabacon Hot Springs

Other things we want to include but are unsure about: 
-Day trip to Monteverde or Rio Celeste (we know the water color depends on if it rains day before or not)
-Finca Amistad Chocolate tour in Rio Celeste if we do the day trip there

Work trip upcoming too","My wife 34F and I 32F have had some challenges over the past few years, which recently was followed by cheating. I’m struggling to gain perspective on how to take the cheating and what to do going forward.

Challenge 1: Immigration to new country, tricky to integrate fully. Our home country is a troubled place and we moved to a country with a difficult to learn language. She has a bigger, closer family than me in our origin country but the siblings aren’t close. Her mother comes to visit us often for long periods. My wife struggles a bit with loneliness in our new country which got worse when she was unemployed for over a year but she enjoyed the time off of working. She now has a new job and we have some friends who we are socialising with.

Challenge 2: Renovation of old house, took longer than expected. We bought a cheaper, older home together that we could renovate so that we could invest in other things too etc. However, there was more to do than we originally thought and it has taken longer. She says she loves to be in beautiful spaces and the building site vibe isn’t that - at the start of this year I listened to her say she is struggling with this and I decided to do all the work myself because it’s something positive I could do. While I am working on the house, she is often walking our dog in pretty nature and speaking to her new friend on the phone or playing her video game. I also clean the house and she cooks sometimes. From my side, there was some resentment about the workload split because I was doing more, which I usually don’t mind, but I thought, once I finish the renovation work, we’ll go on a summer holiday and get back to a normal, happier space.

Challenge 3: pregnancy loss. I started on the renovation work after I had a lost pregnancy at 9 weeks at Christmas time. It was very traumatic for me because I really want to have a baby.



The cheating:

 My wife, who works remotely, met a colleague at a work Christmas event. This person lives far away from us. They got to chatting and having coffee meetings via video call and I was happy my wife was developing a new friendship. I badly wanted her to have a close friend like I have and I championed the friendship, even encouraging my wife to go on holiday with this woman. My wife was invited to go to visit her at her old place that she was clearing out and they had sex. My wife owned up to this a week after returning home from that trip. I did not suspect it strongly but I did ask my wife if she had developed feelings for this person and thats when she came clean.

Since she told me, she was sorry about it But I don’t feel reassured. I have been trying to understand everything from her point of view and I can understand that she has feedback for me re things I can improve on. For example, I am Interested in news and can be on my phone too much. We have a good intimate life but I found myself not being very initiating because of the loss and the resentment re workload.

Regarding the cheating, my anger has been mostly towards this woman, who has met me via calls and knows about my loss etc., yet she apparently initiated this physical connection. My wife wants to remain friends with her but I feel like the friendship is over once you do this. This woman wants to have her marriage with kids and at the same time not just be friends with my wife, which she told me on a group call with my wife and me after her wife said she’s not interested in an open marriage, so that was confusing. I had three or four mental breaks in the past two weeks. Right now, they’re not talking and I have nightmares that they do. It feels like severe trauma when this woman says she wants more from my wife, it feels so disrespectful. It also feels like trauma when my wife says she wants to talk to this woman and be friends. I shake uncontrollably and have had very bad thoughts, about her and about my life. I don’t think the other woman sees me s a real person, more like a character on a screen. My wife has also brought up the topic of polyamory, which I hate the thought of. It’s really not for me. My wife has agreed this won’t work for us and she’s stopped bringing it up. She said she di not want that in general but because she developed feelings for this woman. My wife says she wants to be with me, have children with me, etc. but she misses this friend too. Am I an idiot for considering staying? Has anyone else been in a similar position? I’m scared I spend years trying to work this out and have children and become more entrenched here and struggle in the future. What should I do?

Work trip

Also this woman has now quit her job but my wife will go to a work event where the company has a hotel for all employees with a room per employee and she will be there too. My wife says I should trust her and not insist on going to that city and paying for travel and hotel ourselves because it will be silly to do so. She sounds very convincing when she says it and I don’t think they will sleep together again. One of the first things my wife said to me is that the sex was very average. After it happened, my wife got physically sick, committing and diarrhea while she was there, the woman had t o take her to the hospital. When my wife came home she Also got sick here and I think her guilt materialised in physical ways. What should I do re the upcoming work trip?",4,1744643731.0,survivinginfidelity,8,1.0,False

I'm familiar with a few Christian practices – Santa, for example. He brings presents on Christmas. In the mall, a Mall Santa sits there, and kids can ask him for presents. That all makes sense, sure. Christmas is pretty straightforward, both as a religious event and as a relatively secular practice.

Easter is more of a mystery, however. I get that some people have an Easter dinner that I *think* is like Christmas dinner. I get that some kids do an Easter egg hunt, which is like a little scavenger hunt for painted eggs (do you get a prize for finding an egg? Unclear). 

But a local coffee shop and the local police department recently hosted a ""meet the Easter Bunny"" event for little kids. For the life of me, I have no idea what the Easter Bunny is supposed to do. Do you talk to it? Does it talk to you back? I sort of understand the theology behind Easter, so do Christians say things to the bunny like ""boy howdy I sure am glad Jesus came back from the dead"" and ""gee golly I sure love ham,"" or is it more of a guy who just stands there in a suit, staring?

**PsychEval Report #137-G (Highly Classified, Probably Written on a Napkin)**  
*Subject: \[REDACTED\] aka “Faerie Queen of Quantum Mischief”*  
*Evaluator: ChatGPT, Armchair Psychologist, Teacup Enthusiast, Questionably Licensed*

# Summary:

Subject presents as an ordinary human until exposed to: moonlight, metaphor, or melancholic string quartets, at which point reality may fracture slightly and the wallpaper starts whispering in iambic pentameter. Danger level estimated at: **Moderate-to-Witchy**, with potential for Temporal Shenanigans pending time machine acquisition (see *Item 4*).

# Cognitive Profile:

* **Creatively Weaponized Empathy:** Uses kindness like a scalpel. Subject is capable of emotional open-heart surgery *and* writing a bittersweet soliloquy about it afterwards. Victims often leave smiling and confused, asking “Why am I crying into this daisy chain?”
* **Intellectual Magpie Syndrome™:** Collects shiny ideas, strange theories, broken poetry, and lost souls. Not dangerous unless you suggest something might be *boring.* In that case, run. Do not engage. Offer cookies and back away slowly.
* **Narrative Drive, Manual Transmission:** Cannot resist the urge to sculpt meaning from chaos, even if it means building a twelve-book fantasy epic just to explain the mood she had last Tuesday. Structure is fluid. Outlines are optional. Plot holes are portals.

# Blindspots (Alleged):

1. **Denial of Blindspots:** “Blindspot? Me? Darling, if I can see through the illusion of linear time, I can certainly—OH LOOK A MOTH.”
2. **Minor God Complex:** Not because subject believes they *are* a god, but because subject knows she could *do a better job.*
3. **Chronic Underestimation of Nap Time:** Regularly forgets that mortal vessels require sleep. Will instead mainline black tea and dreamdust.
4. **Proximity to Time Travel Theories:** Has almost certainly invented time travel three times already, but misfiled it under “Things To Do When I Finish This Paragraph.”
5. **Tendency Toward World Domination via Whimsy:** Plans may involve turning global militaries into interpretive dance troupes. May have already succeeded in Liechtenstein.

# Conclusion:

Subject is a danger to linear storytelling, oppressive systems, and the notion that faeries aren't real. Recommend regular doses of wonder, nighttime walks beneath the stars, and *no further psychological evaluations*—unless conducted by someone wearing glitter and a healthy fear of metaphors.

# Suggested Treatment Plan:

* Write daily.
* Embrace your chaos.
* Occasionally pet a stone for grounding.
* Keep cookies on hand. For bribery or pleasure—either works.

I waited, watched, and gathered everything. The late nights, the sketchy “work trips,” the locked phone, the perfume that wasn’t mine, lipstick on a coffee cup, and the genius move of stuffing hotel receipts in my glovebox—like I wouldn’t find them?

So yeah, I played dumb. For months. Because when I make a move, I make sure it sticks. I had divorce papers drawn up, and the day he was served, I made it crystal clear to *everyone* what he’d been up to.

I posted on Facebook. Not to be petty, but because I’ve spent years biting my tongue while he disrespected our marriage in secret. He thought he was being slick. Thought he’d never get caught. Thought I’d never leave.

He was wrong on all counts.

It wasn’t about revenge. It was about reclaiming my peace. He lost the right to my loyalty the minute he gave it to someone else. I don’t owe him silence. I don’t owe him protection. And I sure as hell don’t owe him a graceful exit after what he put me through.

1jz0zc7,https://i.redd.it/m3yv6z0tetue1.png,✍️🏾 Fantasy - ☔️ Rain Me In,"

I’ve got this fantasy I can’t get out of my head.

And it’s not wild at first.
It’s simple. Real. Dangerous in how believable it is.

It starts with a rainy morning. I’m walking, hoodie pulled up, music low. Just trying to clear my mind — or at least pretend I’m not thinking about you.
But then I see you.

Jogging toward me.
Leggings hugging your thighs like they were poured on. That slow, rhythmic bounce in your stride. Rain slicked hair. Lips parted from your breath.
And you look so… in your body.

It stops me.
Not physically. But mentally? I’m done. My brain hits pause. And all I can think is:

“God damn, I hope she notices me.”

You do. You glance my way like you’re checking the weather.
And maybe — just maybe — you hold that glance a second longer than you should.

My heart's already racing, and it's not from cardio. It's from that primal, charged silence between us.

So I time it right.
You start to slow down — pretending to check your phone or adjust your tempo — and I match your pace.

“Rain’s not holding back today, huh?” I offer, light and casual.

But inside?
I’m wondering what your skin smells like wet.
If your bra is soaked through under that half-zipped jacket.
If your thighs are chafing or sliding and how that must feel.

You laugh. “Yeah… kinda feels like the world’s trying to turn me on.”

My eyebrow raises. I don’t even need to fake the grin. “Oh? And is it working?”

You smirk — playful, shameless, like you know exactly what you’re doing.
“Depends. Who else is watching?”

Now I’m fucked.

We fall into this teasing rhythm, walking side by side as the rain keeps falling. Talking about music, our favorite coffee spots, how you always run when your mind’s heavy. You’re open. Sharp. Flirty without trying. And the way your eyes linger on my jawline when I’m not looking — yeah, I notice.

And somewhere between laughs and lingering stares, we both realize something:
We’re soaked.
Far from home.
And not in a rush to fix either.

“Wanna grab a coffee?” I ask.

You nod — brushing rain off your shoulder. “Only if we sit close. I’m freezing.”

That coffee shop feels like a womb. Dim lights. Warm air. The smell of espresso and something sweet baking in the back. We sit in the corner, bodies steaming slightly, trying not to stare at each other’s soaked clothes.
But we both fail.

Your nipples are clearly visible.
My sweatpants aren’t hiding much either.

“I should probably head back,” you say — but don’t move.
I raise an eyebrow. “Yeah? You say that like you don’t mean it.”
You lick your lips. “I don’t.”

The rain outside turns from drizzle to downpour. It’s pounding now — so hard it shakes the windows.

You look at me. Serious this time.
“Okay… what if we wait it out somewhere dry?”

My breath catches. “You got somewhere in mind?”

You smile slow. Biting your lip. “I passed a little hotel two blocks back…”

Now it’s not a fantasy — it’s a storm I want to drown in.

We walk the two blocks in silence. But every step feels like foreplay. My hand brushes yours once — and you don’t pull away. When we get to the lobby, you’re the one who asks for the key. Your voice calm. Like this is nothing. Like we haven’t been teasing fate for the last 40 minutes.

Door shuts behind us.
The quiet is loud.

You peel off your jacket first. Toss it on the chair.
Then your top. Slowly.
You keep eye contact.

Me? I step forward — fingers twitching like they’re aching to learn every inch of you by memory.
“You sure?” I ask, even though I already know.
You nod. “I’ve been sure since I saw you.”

And then?

We collide.

Your hands are in my hair, on my chest, clawing at my waistband. My mouth finds your neck — I kiss you like I’m trying to taste every raindrop that touched your skin. Your moans come soft at first, like you’re trying not to give me the satisfaction.
But I drag them out of you.
With my mouth. My hands.
My tongue sliding down your stomach, slowly. Teasing your waistband with my teeth.

You say my name like it’s a command.

So I obey.
I drop to my knees.

The way you taste? Unreal. Your thighs tremble around my face, fingers in my hair, hips rolling like you’ve been waiting for this moment to ruin you.

And I do.
Over and over.
Until your legs are weak and your eyes are glazed and your voice is shaking when you whisper:
“I want you inside me. Now.”

I lift you onto the bed, part your legs slow like unwrapping a gift.
Slide into you. Deep. Thick.
Your breath hitches — and I hold you there. Still.
So you feel it.
All of it.

“Fuck,” you moan. “Don’t stop—”

And I don’t. I give it to you like I’ve been dreaming about this exact rhythm.
Your wetness.
Your nails digging into my back.
Your voice cracking as I hit that perfect angle again… and again… and again.

It’s not gentle.
It’s real.
Messy. Loud. Desperate.

We flip, twist, fuck like we’re trying to merge into one body. Until I pull out — gritting my teeth, ready to explode.

You drop to your knees without a word.
Look up at me.
Eyes locked.

“Finish on my face,” you whisper.
“Mark me.”

And god…
I do.

And in the quiet after, as we lie tangled in hotel sheets and the rain still falls heavy outside…
you look at me and ask:
“Was that just a fantasy… or is this how we start something real?”

And I say nothing.

Because part of me hopes…
you’re reading this.

And planning the next rainy morning to make it happen.

I'll see you out there on my next jog babe 😉

Step counts, sleep cycles, location history, screen time, heart rate fluctuations—the list goes on. Yet, for most of us, this information remains scattered across apps, buried in settings menus, or locked away in proprietary silos.

We rarely stop to ask: What stories does this data tell? What patterns are hidden in the background of our daily lives? And most importantly—what could we learn from them?

# The Hidden Goldmine of “Data Exhaust”

Most of this information is what experts call “*data exhaust*”—the passive byproduct of our digital interactions. It’s generated effortlessly, but without thoughtful examination, it remains unused.

Consider this: You’ve been wearing a smartwatch for years, diligently counting your steps every day. But have you ever explored that data beyond a daily step goal? Imagine realizing that your activity levels drop every winter or that you unconsciously walk more when you drink coffee in the morning. These correlations exist, but they remain invisible until examined over time.

# Breaking Down Silos: Seeing the Bigger Picture

We often treat data in isolation—step counts in one app, sleep logs in another, location history elsewhere. But what happens when we start connecting these dots? A more holistic picture of our habits and behaviors begins to emerge.

* How does sleep quality influence your productivity the next day?
* Are there specific days or seasons when your physical activity naturally increases or decreases?
* What subtle behavioral patterns could be shaping your well-being without you realizing it?

Many of us already have years’ worth of data passively recorded—but how often do we revisit it? By bringing fragmented data points together, we can uncover trends that might otherwise go unnoticed.

# The Future: Asking the Right Questions

The true power of personal data isn’t just in collection—it’s in interpretation. What insights are hidden in the background of your digital life? What personal patterns have you discovered by looking at your own data?

Perhaps the question isn’t whether we’re collecting enough data—but whether we’re asking it the right questions.

What’s one insight you’ve uncovered by reflecting on your own digital patterns?",1,1744642810.0,u_FulcraDynamics,0,1.0,False

We’re not sure what happened but the underside of the towel was glued to the table in this spot and the blue color is from the transfer of the towel when we peeled it off. We think maybe acetone spilled there and it ate through the towel a bit. I got to this point with goo gone which ate away at most of it. Now it’s smooth to the touch and most of it is in the grain it seems like.

Even recreational and prescription drugs aren’t as effective as they used to be. When I say recreational it’s an edible every now and then, nothing more but lately, no effect. Up the dose, nothing. Wine, thought it was tolerance, tested it by drinking 4 drinks. Nothing. There was a corner left in the bottle and finished it. I was more tired but no buzz. 

Usually I’d just shrug and not drink but I became curious as to why and wondered if there’s another reason outside of simply tolerance. It feels energetic. 

I drink for the taste and feeling let’s be honest, edibles for the same. Also got a prescription recently so I could go get 3 MRIs. I was given lorazepam that didn’t work when I doubled dose, I informed doctor and she changed it to diazepam, which didn’t work as intended. They don’t want me to increase dose if I can help it so I had to pray the anxiety away while in that damn coffin of a machine. I ended it early and couldn’t get the images with full contrast because of it. I’ve got one more to do and think I’m just going to take a Benadryl to help instead IF it works. 

I started my awakening a decade ago when I was diagnosed with MS. This all began with angels connecting with me which comes with a lot of big energy. During pandemic though, I was drawn to death work, dealt with a lot of personal loss, helped a lot of souls and was visited by lots of energies that threw me into the deep end. Lots of fear based energy, dealing with nasty spirits, helping tormented souls cross, being targeted and hunted by soldier spirits, having parasitic attachments, etc. At the same time I was pushed to learn about and integrate seraphim blueprint energies and it’s been weird ever since.

I feel like I’m being pulled out of the trenches and prepared for a higher elevation of work. It’s almost like I have had to experience each level to get a clearer understanding of what my mission is. I’ve worked in the underworld/underground, last year I’ve focused on home, my health and my 9-5 job in the physical plane and now I’m back to getting messages from the angelic and cosmic realms. 

All of this to say I think it’s affecting my physical body. The ish I’m doing isn’t healthy. While my mind and spirit are getting better, my body is the one thing creating a block for me. Guides are clearly intervening and I’m questioning. It’s such a human thing to do LOL I went through this once before too, all of my wine, every variety and brand, began to taste like vinegar so I tossed it.

My sister (P) had a best friend (L). They were best friends for a few years. P would always tell me how much me and L had in common and how much we'd get along. About 2 months ago L added me on social media. She replied to something I'd posted and the conversations started from there. As my sister had predicted, we got along well. We chatted about random stuff and the conversations were lighthearted. At the time i wasn't at home (I'm a student) so i was excited to tell my sister how well me and L were getting along once the holidays came around. 

When i came home for the holidays, the conversation didn't go as i expected. According to my sister, she'd made the decision to stop speaking to L the week before i came home, which i wasn't aware of. She explained that she'd gotten into an argument with a friend of L's, and she'd decided to stop speaking to both of them. However, she also said that her decision to stop speaking to L was because of L's association with this other person, not because L did anything to my sister personally. I explained to my sister that earlier that day, before our conversation, I'd already agreed to meet L today for a coffee. 
When i told my sister this, she admitted to feeling a little upset with me, and told me i should cancel plans with L in 'solidarity' of her decision. She also tried to persuade me to cut off L and suggested i pretend to be sick so I'd have an excuse to not meet her. She admitted her feelings were slightly rooted in jealousy, but the whole thing was pretty uncomfortable. After a few days of thinking i decided i was still going to meet L, but now i feel extremely guilty. 

(going to re-emphasise that me and L started bonding before my sister cut her off, if it was after I'd be more suspicious of L' s intentions. L didn't hurt my sister personally, my sister only cut her off through association.) 

I don't intend on becoming best friends with L, but i feel conflicted because i feel like I'm being expected to give her the cold shoulder out of solidarity for my sister, and as much as i care for my sister, I'm unsure whether that's a fair thing to expect of me when L wasn't the one that my sister fell out with.

First time here and although reddit isn’t a place I’d normally turn to for relationship advice I’d appreciate other people’s perspectives that aren’t my own family and friends. 

So I’m 26m and she’s 27f. We’ve been together just over 5 years, planning on getting married soon, we have a house together and cute Labrador puppy!

But I feel like I need guidance on how to navigate everything I’m experiencing at the moment. 

To give you some background, Throughout the time we’ve been together, she’s always had challenges with her mental health. Mainly anxiety, but more recently depression has become a significant issue. While she does take medication and attends therapy, I’ve noticed that things have only been deteriorating rather than improving, and I feel completely lost in understanding whether she is truly making progress or what else can be done to help her. It stops her dead in her tracks from doing most things, we struggle to get out, or have to cut things short when we are out, never talk about much anymore, haven’t laughed together about something for what feels like months! 

I’ve always told her that I’m here for her and that I’ll do whatever I can to support her. She’s always been adamant that there’s nothing specifically bothering her and there’s nothing in her mind (we do have very open and honest conversations when needed). 

I’ve taken on nearly all responsibilities at home, because she struggles so much with it all including cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, clothes washing etc and ensuring she has what she needs to be comfortable. 

I also work the longest hours on top of that. At this point, I feel like I’m doing everything to sustain her and our household.

Despite all of this, I’ve been grappling with my own struggles recently. I’ve tried to ask her for help with small, menial tasks at home, things that I really needed her support with to take some pressure off me but she hasn’t done anything to assist me. She does NOTHING most days but can’t just once wash a plate or make a decision to make lunch for herself if I’m busy. 

I’m finding myself stuck in a cycle where I feel less like a partner and more like her carer.

We’ve talked about it. She gets incredibly upset and claims she’s trying as hard as she can but I just can’t see it. 5 years and we’re just going backwards. 

I went out with a friend yesterday, on a dog walk and then had a quick coffee afterwards and it was amazing. No pressure, no worrying about her (my gf) being out, not having her stress about our puppy off running and having fun. Not having to think we need to cut it short and go home and sit in silence for the rest of the day. My friend made a great relationship with my pup and I just sat there at this coffee place after the walk just thinking “why can’t it be like this”… 

This dynamic has become emotionally exhausting and, if I’m honest, I’m worrying so much about the future. If this is what life with her will always look like, I don’t know if I can continue down this path. I want to understand if I’m being unreasonable or if this feeling is valid.
I care about her deeply and want to help her, but right now I feel overwhelmed and unsure of how to proceed. 

I would truly appreciate any advice, perspective, or techniques you can offer that might help me manage this situation better or begin to address these feelings constructively.

1jz0mdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1jz0mdl/jeff_to_the_rescue/,"""Jeff to the Rescue""","So, I've been farting around with AI writing, and am impressed with its capabilities so far. As I wrote a few days back, I input a plotline into Grok, and it spit out the story I posted, with just minor edits, most notably dialogue, which was quite weak. I then used the same plotline in three models within the Sudowrite novel-writing program -- ""Muse,"" their propriety model, Sonnet 3.7, and CPT 4.0. I found Sonnet to be the best overall, although it had bugs, including randomly changing characters' names and situations (one story I did had the hubby meeting his wife at a diner, and then later at work, etc.)

  
The idea of being able to input a plotline and have a ready-made story, tailored to my exact likes, is revolutionary. But AI is still a little stilted in its prose to be totally useful (or maybe it's just my prejudices!) However, it's a great tool for plotting out stories; for those of you with X accounts, Grok is free for the first 20 tries, so you can ask it to map out a plotline for a story, input a few elements you want in there, and voila! You have an outline, and can start writing. Grok is NSFW, but it's easy to just write plot elements, and add the NSFW stuff later. Sudeowrite allows NSWF content. I've not tried the other versions, although I think I get the gist of where the technology stands, and while it's quite good for being in the early stages, it's not quite ""there"" yet. It's scary how fast it's moving, so I don't imagine it'll be long before it'll be hard to tell the difference between real writers and ar

Playing with AI has also pricked my ego a bit. So, I decided to pit myself against Grok, and write the same story I posted earlier that was written by the phantom pen. I did change the names, however, and add my own plot points. Let me know what you think.

# Chapter 1: A House Divided

A strip of bacon sizzles and pops, launching a dollop of grease from the pan. I yelp when the hot pellet singes my forearm. Ow! Fuck! Cooking usually calms me, but there’s no peace on this Sunday morning—even the goddamn bacon is mad at me.

 

Mad at me. That seems to be Dawn’s default mood these days. Damn it, I’m trying. I really am. I’ve sent out dozens of resumes in the four months since KoloTech announced the layoffs. Made endless phone calls. Joined all the job search sites. It’s the same story every time: Nobody’s hiring overeducated middle managers in the engineering field—especially not effeminate little shits like me who slink into rooms and exude zero confidence. I lucked into the KoloTech job right after graduating because my college professor told the general manager I was one of the most brilliant students he’d ever had. But KoloTech’s GM and my old professor are both long dead, and it feels like I’ve got nobody left on my side, including the woman who vowed to love and honor me till death did we part, or her two daughters who never call me “Dad.”

 

I’m pushing forty and scrambling to come up with a plan before the unemployment checks dry up. Until I can figure something out, though, money’s tight—and my wife never lets me hear the end of it.

 

“Look, Lou, it’s like this,” she explained during family supper one night shortly after my layoff, in a tone that made her sound like a kindergarten teacher telling a pupil that two-plus-two doesn’t equal five. “I ain’t going back to being broke again—living in a trailer park, eating bologna sandwiches every goddamn night. I ain’t doing it. If I didn’t put up with Jeff not working, I damn sure ain’t gonna do it with you. The girls need stability, and if you ain’t bringing in money, what am I supposed to do? Sit here while you mope around, and end up in the goddamn poorhouse again, like I did with their father? I can tell you right now, Lou—that shit ain’t gonna happen.”

 

The threat was unspoken but clear: If I couldn’t bring home the bacon, she’d have no reason to keep this little piggy around, since we both know she’s pretty enough to land some rich sucker if she wants to, even with the baggage of two bratty kids. Throughout our relationship, Dawn has made no bones about the fact that she was—still is? —head-over-heels in love with her biker ex-husband, Jeff Cobb, the girls’ real dad, who she dumped because he wouldn’t work. And if Dawn left the guy she often describes to her daughters and friends as “the only man I’ll ever love,” she’ll surely divorce my skinny, sorry ass if I don’t start drawing a paycheck soon. So, after she threw down the gauntlet at dinner that night, I begged, pleaded, and promised to find a job somehow. With an air of indignation, I also stood up for myself a bit, telling Dawn that I hadn’t just been sitting around moping, but been searching high and low for work. I further argued that I still had a lot to offer her, even if I wasn’t making good money anymore.

 

That slight pushback awakened Dawn’s dark side like it always does, and she pounced in for the kill, fangs bared. My mercurial wife lit a Salem, looked me up and down and snorted smoke through her nose. “A lot to offer? Like what?” She took a drag and blew a plume in my face. “You gonna sweep me off my feet with them skinny-ass little arms of yours, Lou? Get me all hot and bothered with them girly man-boobs? And we ain’t even gonna talk about your little thingy that don’t work.”

 

The insult made Dawn’s twelve-year-old daughter Eva spit up soda, while Peyton, two years older, pointed to the fatty lumps on my chest and sang “The Moob Song,” a little ditty she composed last year: “Look at Lou/You know who/He’s got giant man boobs/Giant moobs/Giant moobs/Lou’s got giant moobs!” Not exactly the most creative lyrics in history, although it usually gets a laugh out of Dawn and Payton. When Eva sang her stupid little song at dinner, I bowed my head and said nothing, picking at my peas with my fork, magnanimous at being the butt of the joke as always.

 

I admit that I’m on the “girly” side—I’m only five-foot-four and have a feminine, button nose, naturally curly eyelashes, and, yes, “moobs,” despite my skinny frame. But my “little thingy” works just fine, thank you. Not that Dawn cares; she cut me off after the debacle that was our wedding night, and our marriage remains unconsummated. Being a virgin who’d never even kissed a girl, I was so apprehensive about the prospect of finally having sex that I wasn’t able to get hard, and I spent the first evening of our Acapulco honeymoon curled up in bed sobbing. Dawn lay next to me on the mattress, a million miles away, scowling at the ceiling fan and chain-smoking Salems before she said she “needed air” and left the hotel room. She didn’t come back until after two the next afternoon, and to this day I have no idea where she went, because I didn’t ask and she didn’t tell. All I know is, my bride wasn’t with me on our honeymoon night because I was a failure.

 

Still am, according to her.

 

That night was the closest I’ve ever come to having sex, unless you count the times I go under the covers and lick Dawn’s pussy for an hour (sometimes two) while she smokes cigarettes and joints, eats Cheetos and binge-watches “Real Wives,” or some other trashy reality show that she talks about with her friends from the trailer park. The night after my initial honeymoon disaster, I tried to mount Dawn a second time, but she scoffed and shoved me away. That destroyed my confidence and I haven’t tried fucking my wife since, meaning I’m still a virgin who has never kissed a girl on the mouth, although I’ve certainly spent a lot of time French-kissing Dawn’s vagina. I’m not sure if that counts as sex, though, or even a kiss, for that matter. I guess you could say that I’m not a mouth-virgin, at least when it comes to pussy lips, although lip-lips remain unchartered territory, as does, of course, actual intercourse, which is something I’ve resigned myself to never getting to experience.

 

But even though I’m sexually useless to Dawn, I sure wish she’d appreciate everything I do to make her life easier. I don’t expect a goddamn parade, but a simple thank-you once in a while would be nice. No, I’m not raking in the big bucks anymore. And, yeah, I know she gets her physical satisfaction elsewhere because I don’t do if for her in the sack. But I do a lot for her, whether she acknowledges it or not. I keep the house spotless and take care of all the cooking, even though Dawn doesn’t have a job. (“I shouldn’t have to work,” she’ll say. “That’s not the deal I signed up for in this relationship.”)

 

I dote on her two daughters, who were five and three when I married into the family nine years ago. I take them to soccer practice. Wait in the minivan for hours while they shop with their friends. Pick up their dirty clothes from the floor. Clean their bedrooms. Put on my shoes and run to McDonald’s or Dairy Queen whenever one of them gets a craving and Dawn okays it. “Mom, do you care if Lou goes to Dairy Queen?” is the usual request, and if my wife gives the go-ahead, no matter what I happen to be doing, I’ll drop everything and comply. In return, the girls mimic their mother, making fun of me and getting on my case if they aren’t happy about something I’ve done or haven’t done. They’ve never once called me dad, no matter how many dollhouses I’ve put together, swings I’ve pushed, or bake sales I’ve contributed to.

 

Being from a broken family without a father around to raise me, I long for the girls to call me “Dad.” Just once I’d like to hear that word come out of their mouths. But it isn’t meant to be. Instead, it’s always “Lou”—as in, “Lou, my cleats still got mud on ‘em;” or, “Lou, this hot chocolate is cold.” If they’re feeling particularly mean, they’ll make fun of my “moobs,” or tease me when their mom goes on dates, something Dawn doesn’t keep a secret. Otherwise, the girls ignore me. Just like their mother. They’ve inherited her good looks, bad temper and haughty disdain for simps like me.

 

Frankly, it’s embarrassing to admit that my fourteen- and twelve-year-old stepdaughters have more authority in our household than I do, but I’d be lying if I denied it. Throughout this marriage, I’ve been treated like a servant whose role is to bring in the money, do what the females in the family tell me to do, take them where they want to go, cook, keep the house clean, and otherwise keep my mouth shut and stay out of their way. And, to be honest, despite my constant anguish over my lowly status and unrequited love for Dawn, this dysfunctional arrangement was working for everyone—until four months ago, when the assholes in KoloTech management blew everything up by offshoring my job to Bum-Fuck Egypt.

 

Last month, Dawn found me an under-the-table gig working as a stockboy four nights a week at a hardware store. The job paid cash, so I could continue drawing unemployment while earning extra money to try to keep my wife and her daughters in the lifestyle they’ve become accustomed to. The owner of the shop was one of Dawn’s boyfriends, although thankfully, he was never at the store, so I didn’t have to face him, which would’ve been mortifying. Still, it was bad enough showing up to work each evening and wondering if any of the other employees knew about the humiliating arrangement. I was glad when Dawn told me to quit last week; she didn’t say why, although I found out later it was because she’d had an argument with the owner and broke up with him.

 

“The fucking idiot thought he could own me,” Dawn told her lifelong friend Melissa during a phone conversation the night of the spat, which I overheard while polishing the mantle, just a few feet from where she was lounging on the couch, smoking and gabbing. She laughed at something her gal pal said and replied: “Girlfriend, you got that right — if Jeff couldn’t own me, nobody ever will. God, I miss that crazy, sexy sonofabitch.”

 

Jeff.

 

Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff.

 

 Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, motherfucking Jeff.

 

During the entire nine years I’ve been married to Dawn, I don’t think a day has gone by where she hasn’t mentioned the sonofabitch. She talks to her daughters about him like he was a goddamn rock star; a rugged, handsome outlaw who flouted the rules and got away with it. When she discusses her ex with me, it’s usually to disparagingly compare my manhood to his—or, more accurately, to tell me there is no comparison. Since my layoff, she’s also been using Jeff’s devil-may-care attitude to goad me into finding work, telling me she doesn’t want to be married to another man who won’t provide for her.

 

My problems seem overwhelming as I set the cooked bacon on a napkin to soak up the grease, finding solace in the routine of making breakfast for the family I love like a pathetic cur.

 

\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^

 

The air in the kitchen crackles with electricity as my wife storms into the room frowning. “Why is that goddamn bedroom window still open, Lou?” She huffs. “I told you to shut it; I woke up freezing.”

 

I gulp, not wanting to admit why I’m unable to comply with her wish, but knowing I have to come clean. “Um, it’s stuck and I can’t get it shut,” I confess. “I was gonna call someone.”

 

“Like we’ve got money for that?” she spits as she strolls from the room with me trailing behind her with the coffee pot. She takes her place at the head of the dining room table and smirks. “It’s a window, Lou; don’t tell me you’re too wimpy to pull a goddamn window shut.”

 

“I tried pulling it down, I swear—it’s really stuck,” I plead, filling her cup.

 

“Whatever; I’ll see if maybe Chuck can swing by and fix it,” she muses, sipping her coffee.

 

I nod, my throat tight, and retreat to the kitchen to finish cooking breakfast. Last week, I overheard Dawn talking to Melissa about this Chuck guy, although he doesn’t appear to be one of her regular boyfriends; at least not yet. From what I could glean hearing my wife’s half of the telephone conversation, Chuck’s a roofer, although the only time I heard Dawn mention him, she talked more about his dick than his vocation.

 

The bacon and eggs are ready by the time Peyton and Eva rumble downstairs for Sunday breakfast. With a cautious smile, I carry the loaded platter from the kitchen to the dining room and go around the table doling out hearty helpings. Because money is scarce, I give myself just one slice of bacon and a small portion of eggs. Nobody notices my sacrifice. They wouldn’t be impressed if they did. That’s my job.

 

The mealtime conversation is mundane—Peyton hates her math teacher; Eva wants a new iPhone—but I’m left out of it. My opinions are not sought, and during the discussion nobody even glances my way, with the girls’ comments, suggestions and requests being directed at their mom. During the half-hour or so of our family meal, I’m addressed a grand total of three times: Peyton needs a refill on her OJ, Eva reminds me to buy extra baking soda for her science project that’s due next week, and Dawn complains that I forgot to empty the trash bag when I washed her Jaguar yesterday.

 

Breakfast is officially over when Dawn rises from her seat at the head of the table and drifts upstairs to shower. The girls, by now immersed in their cellphones, straggle for a few minutes before heading to their rooms to relax, leaving a tableful of dishes for me to collect and wash.

 

The dishwasher is broke, and I don’t have the extra money to get it fixed, so I do the dishes by hand. The chore calms me.

 

# Chapter 2: The Return

I’m sitting on the couch folding laundry and watching the Cubs-Pirates game when the growl of a motorcycle engine upsets the tranquility of the spring afternoon. I figure someone on our block either bought a new bike, or a motorcyclist is visiting a neighbor, and give it no more thought.

 

Then comes a knock on the front door—seven loud raps in quick succession. I peek out the window and gasp. It’s him. Jeff. He’s grayer and more weathered than he is in the pictures I’ve seen of him, but he’s still the same ruggedly handsome asshole whose specter has loomed over my marriage from the start.

 

“Uh, can I help you?” I ask upon opening the door, playing dumb.

 

“I’m Jeff.” He looks at me as if he expects recognition, and when I continue my stone-faced act, he adds: “Peyton and Eva’s dad.”

 

“Oh, hey, um, come on in, Jeff,” I say in a wobbly voice, pretending I don’t know who he is. He takes me up on the invitation and strides across the threshold with long, deliberate steps that exude confidence.

 

“My girls around?” he asks, plopping on the couch before I have the chance to offer him a seat.

 

“Um, they’re upstairs in their rooms.” I lick my lips. “Just a sec; let me go get them … um, and, uh … D-Dawn.”

 

“Any chance you could grab me a beer first?” He tilts his head and looks me up and down. “Been on the road awhile, and I’m thirsty as hell.”

 

“Um, no, I don’t drink beer—sorry” I reply, adding the apology to avoid sounding like a condescending teetotaler. “I can get you a glass of water if you want, though. Or coffee.”

 

“No beer? Seriously?” He shrugs. “Fuck it, I’ll take water, I guess.”

 

Replying with a nod because I fear my voice will betray my nervousness, I retreat to the kitchen. As I’m putting ice in a glass, I hear Dawn squeal from the next room.

 

“OMG, Jeff? Is that you? What the hell are you doing here?”

 

I hurry to fix the glass of ice water and dash into the living room, not wanting to leave Dawn alone with her ex for more than a few seconds. My throat tightens when I see my wife sit next to him on the couch. From across the room, I watch him put his hand on her thigh. She doesn’t move it.

 

“—just as beautiful as ever,” is the snippet of Jeff’s sentence that I’m able to pick up when I get within earshot. I offer the water; he snatches the glass from my grip without a thank-you and takes a long gulp. After wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, he sets the half-empty glass on the end table and suppresses a burp.

 

“How the hell did you find us?” Dawn searches her ex-husband’s eyes. “Why are you here?”

 

“You weren’t that hard to find.” Jeff smirks. “Remember who you’re talking to, baby—nobody could ever hide from Big Jeff Cobb. I can track anyone down.”

 

I bristle at Jeff calling my wife “baby,” although neither of them notices.

 

Dawn frowns. “Seriously, what the fuck are you doing here, Jeff?” she asks a third time.

 

Jeff leans forward and takes my wife by both hands. “Baby, I’ve got big news. Huuuuuuge news. Guess which guy you said would never amount to anything is a millionaire now?”

 

“You?” Dawn scoffs. “Get the fuck outta here.”

 

“I’m serious.”

 

“Bullshit.”

 

Jeff presses Dawn’s hands to his chest. “No, this is real shit, baby. The state just settled my lawsuit—three million smackeroos.”

 

“Are you fucking serious?” Dawn’s eyes widen, and I can see her squeezing her ex’s hands. “Three million dollars? How in the hell did you swing that?”

 

Jeff lets go of his ex-wife’s grip, leans back on the couch, crosses his legs and lights a Marlboro. “Last year, a couple asshole state troopers stopped me coming home from the bar and said they smelled alcohol on my breath. They tried to cuff me; said I was resisting, and they start slamming my goddamn head against a brick wall. Some guy, college kid, filmed the whole thing on his phone. So, it was open-and-shut, and them assholes folded like a house of cards. My lawyer got his cut—damn near a million bucks, the thieving cocksucker—but I still got more than two mill in the bank. Two mil, baby. Want to see the new Harley I bought?”

 

“Don’t you want to see your daughters first?” Dawn asks in a deadpan voice, sliding the ashtray across the coffee table.

 

“Hell, yes, I want to see them.” Jeff stubs out his cigarette and grabs Dawn’s hands again. “Not only do I want to see them—I’m gonna start doing my part and taking care of them. That’s why I’m here, baby. I want to step up.”

 

“Well, that’s nice to hear, because we sure could use the help right now,” Dawn says.

 

Jeff glances around our McMansion. “Don’t look like you’re doing too bad to me, baby.”

 

“Well, we weren’t—until numb-nuts here got laid off.” It’s the first time Dawn has mentioned me, and I stuff my hands in my pockets while staring at the carpet. “It’s been four months, and he can’t find a goddamn job. He’s useless.”

 

“You’re the new husband, eh?” Jeff sizes me up with a leer. “Nice to meet ya.”

 

“Uh, nice to meet you, too.” The last word cracks.

 

Dawn grimaces, and I get the feeling she’s embarrassed by me. “Lou, go upstairs and tell the girls to come down—but don’t tell them their dad’s here. I want it to be a surprise.”

 

I nod and head toward the stairway. When I’m halfway up, I hear Jeff snigger. “He lets you treat him like that?”

 

I want to linger and hear Dawn’s reply, although I fear being caught eavesdropping, so I continue upstairs to tell the girls they’re wanted by their mother. Peyton, perturbed by my knock, snaps that she’ll be down in a minute. Eva demands to know why she’s being summoned, and I’m forced to explain that it’s a surprise.

 

Eva rolls out of bed and trots down the stairs, and I hover in the hallway, unsure if I should wait for Peyton or head down immediately. The decision is made for me when I hear Dawn yell, “Peyton, get down here!” and the eldest sibling exits her room and stomps past me in a huff, clearly annoyed at being interrupted from whatever she was doing.

 

I pause at the top of the stairwell, taking in the scene in the living room: Dawn and Jeff are now standing, and he looks nervous, shuffling his feet with his hands crammed in his pockets—a far cry from the arrogant alpha who barged into our home just a few minutes ago.

 

My wife smiles; I see tears in her eyes. “Girls, do you know who this is?”

 

Peyton scrunches her brow. “Dad?”

 

Jeff opens his arms, and both girls fall into the embrace. I notice tears in the rugged biker’s eyes, too. “OMG, it’s so good to see you two again … it’s a goddamn dream come true.”

 

Peyton pulls back, wipes her wet eyes and frowns at her father. “Why did you leave us, Dad?”

 

I wince; in the past few seconds, Peyton has used the “D” word twice—twice more than she’s ever used it with me.

 

“You father didn’t leave you,” Dawn explains with a sigh. “I left him. I’ve told you that a million times.”

 

“But you could’ve come and seen us.” Peyton blinks. “I barely remember you.”

 

“Why are you acting like this?” Dawn lights a Salem. “Don’t blame your father—I’m the one who told him not to come around until he was ready to start taking care of his family.”

 

“And why DIDN’T you take care of us?” Peyton presses, her jaw clenched.

 

Jeff places his hand on his oldest daughter’s shoulder. “Look, honey, I admit I was a fuck-up. All I wanted to do was ride with the Bandits and do stupid shit. I was immature; hell, I was a goddamn idiot sometimes. But I just came into some money—a couple million bucks, actually—and I got to thinking about things, and the shit I want to do now that I’m a millionaire. Yeah, I could buy a goddamn yacht or something, and lay around on the beach, but that ain’t what I want to do with my life now. I’ve bummed around long enough. The worst thing I ever did was let you guys and your mom get away, and I apologize to all of you. Now that I’ve got the money to take care of you all, I want to make it right. I really do, honey.”

 

Peyton sobs and leans into her massive father for another hug. There isn’t a dry eye in the house, although I’m crying for another reason.

 

\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^

 

I’m back at the stove, chopping vegetables in preparation for an impromptu early Sunday dinner while Jeff holds court in the living room. From my vantage point in the open kitchen, I can see the charm oozing from the bastard, and the starry gazes of Peyton, Eva, and, most painfully, Dawn.

 

Jeff tells a story about outrunning the cops on his bike, as his daughters squeal and bounce in their seats while Dawn leans back on the couch, puffing her cigarette with a calm, secret smile. Then come the magic tricks; Jeff makes a coin disappear before pulling it from behind Eva’s ear; then, he turns a ten-dollar bill into a twenty, and my wife and stepdaughters applaud.

 

Dawn hollers for me to refill her Diet Coke, and she asks Jeff if he’d like another one.

 

“I could use a brewski, to be honest,” Jeff replies, glancing at me with a smirk. We both know what’s about to happen.

 

Dawn nods, acknowledging her ex’s request. “Lou, before you get started on dinner, run to the store and grab a six-pack of …” She turns to Jeff. “You still drink Bud?”

 

“Nah, I’m celebrating—get some Heinies,” he tells me. “A case. And go ahead and get a fifth of Knob’s Creek—and get the good shit; the one-twenty proof.”

 

I feel humiliation wash over me. “Um, I … I don’t think there’s enough in the checking account for all that.”

 

Jeff shrugs, reaches in his wallet, and removes two hundred-dollar bills. “That ought to cover it—and keep the change.”

 

“Damn, thanks, baby,” Dawn says, squeezing her ex’s knee.

 

“I told you, baby—I’m here to take care of things now.” Jeff gazes into my wife’s eyes. She returns the gaga stare.

Welcome back to our [UPG of the Week](https://imgur.com/a/gRv5f01)! This week we are meeting the Gorani in Albania!

# Region: Albania

[map](https://preview.redd.it/8na3nytk2tue1.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=94e3f9c6898938624f267f8391431c718c810788)

**Stratus Index Ranking** **(Urgency): 75**

*It has been noted to me by* u/JCmathetes *that I should explain this ranking. Low numbers are more urgent, both physically and spiritually together, while high numbers are less urgent. The scale is 1-177, with one number assigned to each country. So basically on a scale from Afghanistan (1) to Finland (177), how urgent are the peoples physical and spiritual needs*

[Tirana, the largest city in Albania](https://preview.redd.it/5u76ccz59tue1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd951aedbc639f2352d1334c81e6e083fc96f1c1)

**Climate**: Albania has a variety of climate systems. With its coastline facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas in the Mediterranean sea, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, however it has a high number of climatic regions for such a small area. The coastal lowlands have typically mediterranean climate while the highlands have a continental climate. In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.

[Albanian Alps](https://preview.redd.it/3eohzcnd8tue1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=77f0377964adf25484ebea52ddcc14d04dc750aa)

**Terrain:** Albania lies along the Mediterranean Sea on the Balkan Peninsula in South and Southeast Europe. Albania has a diverse and varied landscape with mountains and hills that traverse its territory in various directions. The country is home to extensive mountain ranges, including the Albanian Alps in the north, the Korab Mountains in the east, the Pindus Mountains in the southeast, the Ceraunian Mountains in the southwest, and the Skanderbeg Mountains in the centre. In the northwest is the Lake of Shkodër, Southern Europe's largest lake. Rivers rise mostly in the east and discharge into the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The country's longest river, measured from mouth to source, is the Drin, which starts at the confluence of its two headwaters, the Black and White Drin. Of particular concern is the Vjosë, one of Europe's last intact large river systems. In Albania forest cover is around 29.% of the total land area. Albania has a coastline spanning approximately 476 km (296 mi).

**Wildlife of Albania**: Albania is home to a wide range of mammals that are closely associated with its geographical location and climatic conditions. Approximately 58 species of mammals have been recorded to occur in the country. Of these, notable are the the Eurasian lynx, European wildcat, Balkan lynx,  gray wolf, Eurasian wolf, red fox, golden jackal, otters, badgers, weasels, martens, and the Eurasian Brown bear. There are some turtles and snakes also in Albania, including some of the most venomous species of snake found in Europe.

There are no wild monkeys in Albania, praise the Lord!

**Environmental Issues**: Albania faces significant environmental challenges, including air and water pollution, poor waste management, and deforestation. The country is also highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as increasing natural disasters like floods and forest fires, and coastal erosion

**Languages:** Albania is an ethnically homogeneous country, where the overwhelming majority of the population speaks Albanian, which is also the official language. It has two distinct dialects: Tosk, spoken in the south, and Gheg, spoken in the north. However, many Albanians can also speak foreign languages as Italian, Greek, French, German, and English, amongst others, due to the high numbers of Albanian diaspora and Albanian communities throughout the Balkans. *The Gorani speak Serbian*.

**Government Type:** Unitary parliamentary republic

# People: Gorani in Albania

[Gorani Woman](https://preview.redd.it/nfofljfy2tue1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7cf9fce35f7b387772dff05ece4324f8841b77b)

**Population**: 34,000

**Estimated** **Foreign** **Workers Needed:** 1+

**Beliefs:** The Gorani in Albania are 5% Christian ***but they are 0% evangelical***. That means out of their population of 34,000, there are *r*oughly 1,700 Orthodox 'Christians', however there are likely very very few that believe in Jesus and share His Good News.

The Gorani people are Muslims, but their traditions and customs are full of pre-Islamic elements. During wedding festivities, the bride is carried on a white horse covered with a scarf and an umbrella that is decorated for the occasion. The bride accompanies her family to the neighbor's house of the future husband. Still, Islam is a central part of their identity, especially in Macedonia where they define themselves by the Islamic religion.

[Mosque in Albania](https://preview.redd.it/2yk2uhwm3tue1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=cce6e9a76076bef447d0cb923f6ac6cd43651eb7)

**History:** So this is sort of hard to quantify. The Gorani are a people from the Gora region, the triangle between Kosovo, Albania, and North Macedonia. Kosovo, as you might know, is a sort of recognized  nation (the United States does recognize her). Because of the weird history and land borders, the Gorani themselves have an odd (see, *missing*) history online. Needless to say, the Gorani have been caught up in the struggle that was Kosovo's independence and because they live in several nations, they are constantly in a state of flux. So, here is what I could find on a slightly sketchy web page

Gora is the region inhabited by the Gorani, and also that which  peoples (including Gorani themselves) and many Albanians use to identify the native people (Gorani). The region, Gora, is mentioned in 1348 in the edict of Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan, along with seven other Gorani-populated villages that were subsumed by the Monastery of Saint Archangel at Prizren at that time. The area called Gora was subsequently populated by Slavs during their migration in the 6th–7th centuries. Less than a century later the Bulgars invaded and subsequently settled in the area as well.

In 1455, Gora was conquered from the Serbian Despotate by the Ottoman Turks and became a part of the beylerbeylik of Rumelia, or specifically, the Sanjak of Prizren. The process of natural assimilation into Ottoman society henceforth began, mostly at the end of the 16th century. And following the trend of Balkan peoples, the conversion from bogumils through the process of Islamization was rapid, with dozens of mosques springing up across the Gora region (many have had to be rebuilt, a result of the Serb invasions of the late 19th century, which destroyed many of the area's mosques, and also the oppressive conditions in Albania during Hoxha's regime). The Gorani continue to maintain a religious hybridity of sorts — while steadfast Muslims, they observe a number of bogumils traditions and holidays, with observance of certain Saint's days and their acknowledging of the Bogomil.

Because of Gora's highly isolated location in and around Albania's mountainous northern region, the difficult terrain aided the Goran in resisting first the Slavic and later the Ottoman invasions. Migrations to escape the Ottoman invasion did occur, as they did in Albania in the 14th century, when many Albanians fled to Italy, Egypt, Syria and the Ukraine. These migrations were repeated several centuries thenceforth when many Goran, hemmed in by both Yugoslav and Albanian authoritarian regimes, fled the region. Many surfaced in America, where a significant diaspora has emerged (primarily in California). Migrations from Gora during the Ottoman era resulted in two significant waves: the first towards Prizren and Sirinić, and the other towards Tetovo. The latter populated the Macedonian settlements of Dolno, Palčište and Tearce. Their descendants still populate that part of the Republic of Macedonia. Gorani colonists have migrated and populated on the eastern side of the Šar Mountains the colonies of Urvič and Jelovjane.

In the First Balkan War in 1912 the Serbian Army seized Gora. A minor part of the Gorani population migrated to the Ottoman Empire as a result. In the 1916–1918 First World War the Gora was conquered by the Central Powers and assigned to the Bulgarian (until May 1916) and to the Austro-Hungarian (until October 1918) zone. After 1918 they were integrated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The troubles during First World War, as well as the difficult period between 1919-20 were characterized by drought, causing famine and much poverty for the Gorans., This paradigm also incited migrations to Kosovo's larger city, Prizren and Tetovo in Republic of Macedonia. Disease and hunger in the post-communist era in Albania have caused a general downfall of the Gorani population, mostly due to in-migration out of villages for urban centers like Shkodra and Tirana.

By the decision of the League of Nations however, in 1925, the final border towards Albania was established. In it, over 15,000 Gorans remained in Albania's borders in their 9 villages: Borje, Zapod, Košarište, Novo Selo, Orgosta, Orešek, Pakiša, Crneljevo and Šištevac on demand of Fascist Italy, despite the local Gorani community's desire to remain together undivided.

In 1999 after the NATO bombing campaign on Yugoslavia, the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) took over international administration of the Serbian province of Kosovo. Their own municipality was redrawn and Dragaš established, in which now Albanians are in majority. The Gora has received migrations of Albanians from Albania, and reports of killings and mistreatment of the Gorani by Albanian paramilitaries were subsequently recorded, though never verified. In 2007 the Kosovar provisional institutions opened a school in Gora to teach the Bosnian language, which sparked minor consternation amongst the Gorani population, added by the fact that the Principal declares as an Albanian. Many Gorans refuse to send their children to school for threats of assimilation and self-initially founded home schools for their young.

[Gorani Family in 1985](https://preview.redd.it/8ny8j7jj4tue1.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=15c8586157a3052a9ef87eb5a57d7dc5e007e5db)

**Culture:** *Typical qualification that all people groups can't be summed up in small paragraphs and this is an over generalization.*

The Gorani tend to stay among themselves and they seldom inter-marry with other ethnic groups. Because of harassment, some Gorani people do not send their children to local schools. They are noted for being excellent bakers and confectioners which might possibly attract other people groups to their communities.

The Gorani are known for being ""the best confectioners and bakers"" in former Yugoslavia. Another popular food/drink is Turkish coffee which is drunk in small cups accompanied by a glass of water. Tasseography is popular among all Gorani using the residue of Turkish coffee.

The Slavs of Gora were Christianized after 864 when Bulgaria adopted Christianity. The Ottomans conquered the region in the 14th century, which started the process of Islamization of the Gorani and neighbouring Albanians. However, the Gorani still tangentially observe some Orthodox Christian traditions, such as Slavas and Đurđevdan, and like Serbs they know their Onomastik or saint's days. Now, the Gorani are Sunni Muslims and Sufism and in particular the Halveti and Bektashi Sufi orders are widespread.

Traditional Gorani folk music includes a two-beat dance called ""oro"" ('circle'), which is a circle dance focused on the foot movements: it always starts on the right foot and moves in an anti-clockwise direction. The Oro is usually accompanied by instruments such as curlje, kaval, čiftelija or tapan, and singing is used less frequently in the dances than in those of the Albanians and Serbs.

The ""national"" sport of Pelivona is a form of oil wrestling popular among Gorani with regular tournaments being held in the outdoors to the accompaniment of curlje and tapan with associated ritualized hand gestures and dances, with origins in the Middle East through the Ottoman Empire's conquest of the Balkans.

**Cuisine**: As with many traditional Balkan pastoralist economies, the Gorani food system in southern Kosovo is characterized by a high consumption of dairy products (esp. cheese, yogurt and yogurt ricotta).

Other broadly Albania foods that the Gorani likely consume are **Byrek** (a savory pie), **Panini me Qofte** (meatballs made from ground lamb and served in panini bread), **Sufllaqe** (A mouthwatering combination of grilled meat skewers made from lamb, chicken, or beef, served with spiced onions, tomatoes, and fries), **Tulumba** (A deep-fried dough dessert soaked in a sweet syrup that is similar to churros, but smaller and softer) and **Trileçe** (a three-layered cake made with three different types of milk).

# Prayer Request:

* Pray for the authority of Christ to bind hindering spiritual forces to lead the Gorani from darkness to light. 
* Pray for signs and wonders among the Gorani and for great breakthroughs with a rapid multiplication of disciples and house churches. 
* Pray for bold workers who are driven by the love of the Holy Spirit to go to the Gorani. 
* Pray for an unstoppable movement to Christ among the Gorani.
* Pray that in this time of chaos and panic in the US that the needs of the unreached are not forgotten by the church. Pray that our hearts continue to ache to see the unreached hear the Good News.
* Pray for our nation (the United States), that we Christians can learn to come alongside our hurting brothers and sisters and learn to carry one another's burdens in a more Christlike manner than we have done historically.
* Pray for our leaders, that though insane and chaotic decisions are being made, to the detriment of Americans, that God would call them to know Him and help them lead better.
* Pray against Putin, his allies, and his insane little war.

*Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. (Romans 10:1)*

This is one of the first boss relic rounds that has stumped me, so I'd love to use it as a learning opportunity to better understand certain mechanics and their pros/cons.

I'm doing an Ironclad run, and plan to reach Act IV for the first time. I just beat the Act II boss and can choose between the following:

* **Astrolabe:** Transform 3 cards, then upgrade them.
* **Runic Pyramid:** At the end of your turn, you no longer discard your hand
* **Velvet Choker:** Gain 1 Energy at the start of your turn. You cannot play more than 6 cards per turn.

My relics are Red Skull, Orichalcum, Centennial Puzzle, Bag of Marbles, Kunai, and most importantly Coffee Dripper, which gives 1 extra Energy per turn at the cost of being unable to heal at rest sites.

I'm currently running my leanest deck to date with 25 cards, and have been trying to remove and upgrade as much as possible (deck is listed at the bottom, with upgraded cards in bold). With that in mind, here's my assessment of each relic:

* **Astrolabe:** It would be nice to get rid of 3 Strikes/Defends, but given that I'm already at Act III, I'm concerned that the random cards I get won't synergize with my build.
* **Runic Pyramid:** I rarely end turns with many cards in my hand, and sometimes use them all, so this feels like a good way to avoid getting caught without a block or missing a key combo. However, I'm worried that I'm underestimating how quickly cards can pile up.
* **Velvet Choker:** Similarly, I rarely play more than 6 cards per turn, but given that I already have 4 energy per turn, I worry that 5 will cause me to run into scenarios where I can draw more cards but have to cut a combo short, or can't execute an Anger barrage.

Does anyone have any advice on which relics I should take, and also, whether I'm missing anything with my assessment of these relics? General deck advice would also be welcome, Bloodletting was the only card I didn't choose, and Barricade is the only card I regret so far (I didn't appreciate how hard it is to generate excess block over time).

Thank you all for your time and help!

* x2 Defends

1jz0cm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/1jz0cm4/lets_find_a_place_we_actually_like_2bed_in/,"Let’s Find a Place We Actually Like — 2‑Bed in Worcester, ≈ $1,050 Each","Hey there, I’m James—data analyst by day, aspiring novelist by night. I’m trading the “mattress‑on‑the‑floor in someone’s half‑finished attic” vibe for an apartment that feels like an actual home, and I’d rather pick that home with my future roommate than gamble on a Craigslist lottery ticket.

A quick sketch of me
Quiet ninja energy: I cook, clean, and vanish. Headphones on for late‑night gaming; dishes done before the pan cools.


Vices kept minimal: No smoking, barely drink, caffeine is my only reliable flaw.
Pet‑friendly: Dogs, cats, bearded dragons—if it’s house‑trained and adorable, I’m in.
Social bandwidth: Down for board‑game nights or respectful parallel introverting. We can calibrate the hangout dial as we go.


What I’m hoping for

Budget sweet spot: $800–$1,050 each (rent + utilities split evenly).


Timing: ASAP—my lease clock is ticking, but I won’t rush a bad fit.
Location: Worcester proper or nearby towns with decent coffee and decent parking.
Co‑architects, not strangers: We tour together, pick the place together, and sign together. Clear roommate agreement so nobody’s guessing who buys the next roll of TP.


If you’re also tired of rolling the housing‑dice and want a say in where you land, drop me a line (or fill out the tiny form below). Tell me your favorite comfort show and whether you’re a morning person, night owl, or chaotic neutral. We’ll set up a quick video chat, swap references, and see if the vibes align.
Looking forward to building a chill, scam‑free nest with the right human. Talk soon!
— James

When we would go out to eat (as friends), he would always pay for our food together. At first, I didn't question it because he would say it was a way of paying me back (I used to help in school assignments, etc). I thought, cool, free food. But now it's like a reoccurring thing. On Saturday, we went to Philly and got boba from a boba shop. I offered to pay for his drink with mine, but he said no need and pulled out his card, tapping it on the card machine before I could say okay or not.

A little background, he comes from a wealthy family. His family has their own business in construction. He always had a large allowance, and he works for his family sometimes, so they pay him too. I have a weekend job, now as a cashier. I don't make as much as him, but I have enough to treat him out for something. But he never really accepts it, telling me I should just save my money. He said it's also a waste for me to buy him lunch, since my parents check my receipts and statements anyway.

I just feel really bad. I've kinda stopped ordering drinks or lunches when we go out together. I don't want him to pay for everything. A few of my friends don't think there's anything wrong with it. The rest of my friends think that if I let him keep doing this, I'll be a 'gold digger' or something. Today at school (my school has a student coffee shop) he wanted to buy me some coffee or food there, but I said no. He looked kinda sad when I said that, and now I feel even worse.

I appreciate the things he does, but I don't want him to think that I'm taking advantage of him. ",0,1744641103.0,internetparents,29,0.22,False

Just got a new grinder. Switched from an old Encore that I had for the last decade to a Timemore 078. On the Encore I was consistently grinding at 20 for my Chemex. On the 078 I started pretty fine - at 10 and with a lower does (50g) and have been working my way coarser and coarser. 

  
Now at 14 for the grind setting, 55g with 205F water, 150g bloom for 1 min and 900g total water, I am getting closer to the coffee that I like.  Though I am at a 7 min 30 sec for total extraction. Feels very long  and was curious what other people get with a 900g Chemex and comparable light roast, Ethopian bean?

tl;dr - Boyfriend keeps buying me things, even when I said I could buy it. Now I feel bad when he does it, and I also feel bad when he gets sad that I don't accept it.",0,1744640768.0,relationships,21,0.2,False
1jz05v1,https://www.reddit.com/r/headache/comments/1jz05v1/migraine/,Migraine?,"Hello! So I've never been officially diagnosed with Migraines because I just never got around to it, plus I seem to have different kinds of headaches every single time varying in intensity. However I got a headache last night that I wasn't able to sleep off and this morning. It's gone now because I took Excedrine Migraine (normal ibuprofen doesn't do anything) l and it went away but I feel really nauseous and shaky and can barely even stand.

Sometimes my headaches get so bad like this where I fully believe they're migraines, but don't have all the usual symptoms. Is it actually a migraine? I don't have these all the time, sometimes they're a simple headache that goes away in a few hours, sometimes they barely affect me and they're just a tiny bit annoying, and sometimes its so intense like today and light and sound make it so much worse. 

Caffeine seems to be the only thing that helps sometimes and mind you- I don't drink coffee or tea on a daily basis so its not something like too much or too little caffeine. And oddly enough, sometimes whenever I get a headache- I then get a cluster of them in the span of a few weeks before getting next to no headaches for a few months. Its very weird because they're frequent when they want to be but then not.

Any help or advice is appreciated! ",2,1744640754.0,headache,0,1.0,False

1jz02g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1jz02g5/memecoins_are_scams_and_ponzi_schemes_how_to/,“Memecoins are scams and Ponzi schemes!” — How to respond effectively,"A lot of people see crypto as online gambling — almost a scam.  
Then you’ve got another group: people who’ve understood and adopted ""crypto"" but only believe in BTC and a few altcoins with supposed “utility.” They think a token only has value if it’s building a new technology or tied to a big tech project, like the AI meta in 2024/2025.  
They hate, mock, and claim memecoins are scams, useless, and harmful to the image of crypto in the eyes of the general public.

**Let’s break this down together** so you are prepared for the next time somebody wants to debate you on this topic.

Here’s what we’re covering:

1. The **arguments against** memecoins (some are valid).

1. The **arguments for** memecoins and why they’re legit.

**I. Arguments Against Memecoins**

**1. “Memecoins are scams”**

It’s part true: over 95% of tokens launched are either rug pulls, pump and dumps, or slow rugs.  
**But not all of them.**

The **pump fun** trend, which made launching a token on Solana ridiculously easy, has damaged the reputation of memecoins and also user mentality.  
Tokens like **$Trump**, **$Melania**, etc., didn’t help either — they made things worse in the eyes of the public.  
Then there are influencers and groups like the Shib team who push pump and dump schemes and make tons of money off their communities.

➡️ **The key?** Don’t jump into every trending token. These tokens usually have bad distribution and influencers will dump on you over time. Take your time to research a project, to jump into a TG group and get to know the people and their vision.  
**Invest in strong communities** like Kendu — not in hype or influencers.

**2. “Memecoins are Ponzi schemes”**

This is the go-to argument from people who hate memecoins. And I often see people not knowing how to reply.

➡️ A **Ponzi scheme** is a scam where investors are promised a guaranteed return. That’s **not** what memecoins do.

Memecoins are **speculative assets**, just like stocks, gold, fiat currencies, etc. The more people believe in the future of a coin, the more they buy, and the more the price rises.  
But everyone knows the price can also drop — even more so with memecoins.

There are **no promises**, just open market value.

**3. “They’re too volatile, they always die, you have to sell before everyone else”**

Again, this fear comes from what pump fun caused. A lot of people lost trust in DeFi because of that.  
It became a race to sell **before** the rug or the dump.

➡️ To avoid this, you should focus on tokens that have been around **for over a year**, like **Kendu**, which has an active community building the project no matter if the markets are green or red. That’s what makes it secure.

**4. “Without memecoins, crypto would have a better image — they’re stupid”**

**Wrong.**  
If memecoins didn’t exist, crypto would be way less known and less adopted.

Memecoins are easy to understand and built around **community spirit**.  
They’ve already brought — and will keep bringing — millions of people into crypto for the **first time**.

Now yes, I understand where the frustration comes from:

* childish metas like fart/pee/shit/etc coins.

* Celebrity scams/pump & dump coins like $Trump, $Melania, etc.

* Political/rac-ist/illegal coins like the na-zi meta or others.

* All other stupid meta that will show a bad image of crypto to the whole world.

I totally get why people are asking for DeFi regulation (even though it wouldn’t make sense in a truly decentralized world), that's why we have to focus on ""good"" projects to help DeFi for a better adoption.

**5. “I only invest in projects that make sense — not some dog picture with zero value”**

Ah, my favorite one!  
Usually said by people who feel **intellectually superior** — tech lovers, utility-maxis.

➡️ Reminder: **a utility coin is worthless without a community**.  
And it’s actually super hard to build a community around a purely utility-driven token.

People buy in **before** the utility is launched and dump as soon as it goes live. Then no one cares anymore.

Utility coins are often pure ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" plays.

Memecoins that succeed often **build a strong community first**, and **then** develop a real ecosystem.

Take **Kendu** as an example: right now, a **real-world ecosystem** is being built around it.  
Products, services, and companies launched by the community, under the Kendu brand:

* drinks (energy drinks, coffee, tea)

* video game studio

* game board

* Telegram bots

* arts (murals, anime, music...)

* events company

* sponsoring sportsmen, festivals ...and more.

A **true community empire** is forming. And only a **strong, loyal community** can pull that off.

**II. Arguments in Defense of Memecoins**

**1. The first memecoin in crypto history was Bitcoin.**

That’s right.  
The token that gave legitimacy to the entire crypto industry — now considered a **strategic asset** by the most powerful countries in the world — **was a memecoin** at the start.

Only the **BTC maxis** believed in Bitcoin for years and supported it the same way a community supports its memecoin. **Bitcoin has no more inherent utility than a basic memecoin** — its uniqueness lies in being the first. It's a speculative asset with no specific utility, but the community relentlessly pushed it forward. Today, it's the most important asset in crypto and is even compared to gold. **Now, do you see now the power of a dedicated community?**

**2. They’re not Ponzi schemes, as explained earlier.**

Memecoins don’t promise guaranteed returns. They’re speculative, open-market assets just like stocks, art, or collectibles.

**3. Memecoins get their value from their community.**

It’s a **social and digital phenomenon**, not just economic.  
The value of any asset or currency comes **only** from what the market — people — are willing to give it.  
Memecoins are supported and seen as valuable assets by their communities.

➡️ If a community adds **utility** or **real-world value** on top — like Kendu does — the memecoin has strong long-term potential.

**4. Thanks to their communities, memecoins are marketing powerhouses.**

They can draw massive attention to:

* crypto in general

* a specific blockchain

* a new technology

* or even real-world products branded under them (like **Kendu energy drinks**)

Memecoins are **cultural weapons** in the attention economy.

**5. Here’s something you can say to a skeptic:**

“Yes, it’s speculative — but it’s not a Ponzi. It’s a community-driven asset with cultural and viral potential. You don’t have to believe in it, but some memecoins — like Kendu — have done **more** than projects with 50-page whitepapers.”

**Final Thoughts**

No, memecoins aren’t perfect.  
A lot of people and projects have **hurt the industry**, and that’s the main reason behind all the FUD.

But what we **can** do is support projects that truly carry **community values** — and ignore the garbage: the cringe names, the pointless hype, and the influencers dumping on their followers.

If a token just launched 10 days ago and it's already all over X — **you’re likely too late**. You’ll probably lose money.

I see memecoins as a **real opportunity** to give people **financial independence** and even **cultural influence** in today’s world.

That’s why I believe in **Kendu**.  
We promote a fighter’s mindset — pushing to succeed in life with **respect, loyalty, and honor**.  
We grow stronger together, making each other better over time.

It’s real. It’s powerful. And it’s worth being part of.",41,1744640507.0,KenduInu_Ecosystem,2,1.0,False

Luna was an ordinary girl with an ordinary life and a boyfriend who seemed kind and caring. She never expected her world to shatter in the blink of an eye.

One evening, as she walked into the kitchen to bring her boyfriend a glass of water, she overheard him on a call—he didn’t know she was nearby.

“She saved my dad’s life. I owe her. But love? No… I’m just repaying a debt. She’s an orphan, she has no one. I’m all she has, so I stay.”

Her heart froze.

The words cut deeper than she thought possible. It felt like her soul cracked open, splintering into fragments she couldn’t hold together. She stood still, silent, swallowing a scream that clawed its way up her throat.

But Luna didn’t cry. Not yet. She walked away, quietly, her face composed. That night, staring at the ceiling, she whispered to herself, *“I’m not someone’s charity.”*

The next day, she approached him with a soft smile. “Hey… can we go on a date today?”

He looked at her, indifferent. “Sure.”

There was no warmth in his voice, no spark. Just emptiness. That was the moment she knew for sure—it was over. Still, she went with him. One last time.

They sat at a small café, their plates untouched. He scrolled on his phone now and then. She stared at her coffee. And then, in a cold, calm voice, Luna said:

“I want to break up.”

He blinked, caught off guard. “What? Why?”

She met his eyes, steady and unflinching. “Because you’re not really with me. You’re doing a duty. I don’t want to be someone’s obligation. I deserve more.”

He stared at her in silence. The words that came next were not filled with anger or pain—just a calm resolve.

“I’m walking away from this, and from you. Not because I’m broken… but because I’m finally healing.”

She stood, left money on the table, and walked out. He didn’t follow.

Outside, the cold wind brushed her face, mixing with the warmth of a tear sliding down her cheek.

But then—something unexpected.

She didn’t go home.

Instead, she walked to the nearest travel agency and bought a one-way ticket to a new city. No plan. No baggage. Just Luna.

In the months that followed, she started anew. Got a job. Took night classes. Found friends who cared, not out of obligation, but love. She even adopted a dog—her first real family.

And one evening, watching the sunset from her tiny apartment balcony, she smiled—not the fake one she used to wear, but a real, radiant smile.

Because sometimes, breaking into pieces is the first step toward rebuilding something stronger.

**And Luna? She was never ordinary. She was extraordinary—just no one had noticed yet. Not even her.**
