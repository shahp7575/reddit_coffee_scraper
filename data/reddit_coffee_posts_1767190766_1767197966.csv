I've been having stomach issues for a while, and I don't know if I should be concerned enough to go to the doctor. I'm poor, so I don't want to do it if I don't have to (but also would love not to die).

I've had three bloody stools this month, and after learning what to look for, I realized that I've had tarry stool (melena) several times in the last 6 months. It smelled rotten, had a sticky, dark texture, and stuck to the bowl. 

2 december: i had an extreme stomach pain all day, from before lunch-time until night-time. It made it harder to breathe, and I could barely sit. Got a cold sweat when I walked around. It hurt in the whole abdomen area, but It was concentrated on the left, just below the ribs. I felt nauseaus and uneasy. I didn't check my stool that day, but I remember it smelling FOUL, like rotten. 

11 december: I had an uneasy stomach all morning, it was loud during class (of course) and made noises every couple minutes, for hours. When I got home I went to the bathroom, and it felt very uneasy, but I didn't look. I didn't feel finished though, and went again an hour or so later, and then I saw that it was dark and ""coffee ground"" texture, mixed with liquid. I had had migraines a few days in a row before this.

After this, I download an app and logged every stool. It has been mostly mushy (which isn't very normal for me).

31 december (today): I noticed some dark red blood in the stool. I feel nauseaus and light headed. I have had migraines for three days before today (might be a coincidence, but weird that it happened twice).

Another thing I just realized is that my mom has endometriosis, and the 2 december pain/stool was the day after my period ended, and today is day three after my period ended.

The only other things I know about my family is that mom has polycythemia vera and her mom has sarkoidosis.",1,1767197804.0,DocSupport,0,1.0,False

Met a woman through volunteering. In person she’s warm: strong hugs, inside jokes, once mentioned inviting me for coffee at her place. Over text she’s distant—slow replies, sometimes seen/no reply, no follow-up. We’ve met ~6 times, barely talked alone, and she doesn’t know I’m queer. I like her and I’m confused. Is this just friendly energy + bad texting, or disinterest? Would asking her for a clear coffee help, or should I let it go?
I wished her a merry Christmas and she replied 2 days later, yesterday I asked her if (during the day)it was necessary to bring brushes or paints to the volunteer center, and she read the message but didn’t reply.

1q0gop3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ocdwomen/comments/1q0gop3/ocd_while_living_with_others/,OCD while living with others,"For context: I (28f) have just moved into/started renting a room in a home (I live in a major city and don’t make enough to live alone/no family or friends to live with). The broker assured me that he would do his best to find me roommates that were young female professionals or grad students. I requested female due to a history of S/A and feeling particularly uncomfortable alone around men. Now, I know legally the broker has rules to follow and can’t discriminate on age, gender, etc. Anyways, I have ended up with two male roommates (58m) and (22m). I have met the (58m) briefly. I have never met the other (22m). 
To say I’m unhappy about this arrangement would be a massive understatement.

Here is my request for support and advice. I know I just have to learn to cope and deal with the situation. But I’m panicking. Spiraling. Due to my ever present fear of being alone with men (due to history mentioned above) I am trying not to ramp up my behaviors.
Sometimes I don’t know what’s over the top/obsessive or what is reasonable or “normal”. 

Additionally, I grew up with 5 brothers, have previously lived with a male partner, and just my personal experiences lead me to believe a majority of men are not the ~cleanest~ and this adds a whole new level of panic, anxiety and general concern for my health. 
Truthfully, I think I could really use some (gentle) perspective on some things I have decided to change since I have moved here. If they are not reasonable, I would appreciate some feedback. 

#1. I decided to keep virtually all bathroom items (towels, toothbrushes, hygiene tools) in my room because of I worry about the cleanliness (pee splatter and roommates not closing the toilet when they flush). Now I know there are scientific studies done showing this is a real thing, but I’m not sure if I’m taking it too far, or being irrational. 
#2. My bedroom has two entrance doors, both for which I bought locks (there are no built in locks on either door…) not only because I fear them coming into my room with my consent but also coming in while I’m gone and taking things/messing with my stuff. 
#3. I have labeled the majority of my things (food, water filters, coffee maker, rice cooker, things of that nature) so they will not be used (at least without requesting first). I don’t mind to share *some* things, but just need clear communication about it first. But I know from past roommate experiences, I cannot always rely on others to effectively communicate.

Is it?,"I (43) got married to a Czech (45). We used to be coworkers, both of us in good positions but he got promoted into a ""key position"", so very up in the organisation. To avoid any conflicts I found a job elsewhere. But my husband for the past 6 months has had an assistant, like a secretary. A younger woman, late 20s or 30. 

And they are way too close or so I feel. He is not a friendly and approachable man. He doesn't like small talk with people, is very focused on his professionals goals and the fact he should be ""nicer"" is something we talked about several times. But he is nice with her. She is a Slovak woman. Very pretty. He somestimes comes home at 9 pm from the office. I understand he is very busy but she is there with him. I hear her voice when call him. I used to work in that company for 4 years so I made friends. And a trusted one told me she is almost all the time in his office,  they often go for lunch together and she arranged the collar on his coat once. 

I asked him, because I am open to conversation. And he said its a cultural things. Brotherly. Slovaks and Czechs are like  brothers. He has around 200 brothers and sisters, both czech and slovaks around him and he is not brotherly at all with any of them. She is the only one that can leave whenever she needs to. And there is one thing that really pushed me over the edge. He spilled coffee on his shirt one day. White shirt. He didn't bring it home. He was the one who told me about the incident. And I asked where is the shirt? She offered to wash it for him. Also, my husband loves being in good shape. And he said one evening that he didn't come home from office because he went to the gym. Fine. But the next day he forgot about what he said, I guess. Because he told me he needs to renew his gym subscription as it has been expired for 4 days already.

1q0gl3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q0gl3x/parking_tips_for_university_of_north_dakota_mens/,parking tips for university of north dakota mens hockey vs. mercyhurst mens hockey at ralph engelstad arena (grand forks 01/02),"  
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the und vs. mercyhurst game on january 2nd at the ralph. parking around the arena is honestly a zoo for a hockey game, especially since the actual rea lots are all reserved for champions club members, no general public parking allowed on site. you have to park off-site and walk or grab the shuttle.  
  
first up, and my favorite insider tip, is to check out Prked. it's this app where people right next to the arena rent out their driveways or garage spots for the night. it's usually way cheaper than the campus lots, you skip a ton of the inbound traffic off i-29/gateway drive, and you can walk right over in like five minutes. honestly, it's the move to avoid the chaos and the freezing walk.  
  
for the official options, und parking services runs a bunch of event lots a short walk away. keep in mind that other campus lots, especially north of university avenue, will be enforced for permits, so don't try to sneak into a random student or faculty spot unless you like tickets. parking enforcement usually starts after 2:00 pm, so don't assume you can arrive early and beat the system.  
  
here are the main dedicated event lots and prices: the cheapest lot is the harvard lot (lot 62) behind archives coffee shop for $10/vehicle, but it is credit card only via the text2park pay feature. the smhs lot (lot 102 near the medical school) and the central finance lot (lot 104 west of casey's) are both $15/vehicle. the smhs lot takes cash or credit card (text2park), but the central finance lot is credit card only. the wellness center lot (lot 4) is the priciest one at $20/vehicle, and they only accept cash. for the lots that use credit card payment, look for the signs and text 25023 to pay by phone with the text2park feature.  
  
you really need to get there early to snag a spot in the closer lots and avoid the worst of the traffic coming off i-29.  
  
if you want a cheap option that’s a longer walk, you could try parking downtown. since the game starts at 7:07 pm on a thursday, on-street parking and the city parking ramps (like the corporate center ramp or central ramp) are free after 5:00 pm. it's a hike, but it saves you the campus parking fee.  
  
if you're getting dropped off or using a rideshare like uber or lyft, tell them to use the designated drop-off location which is the southwest entrance of the arena, or the east side main entrance. trying to get dropped off anywhere else is a nightmare for traffic.  
  
hope this helps everyone get to the game smoothly. go hawks!",1,1767197370.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I’m hoping there are some quiet, inactive, or off-the-radar operators nearby who’d be up for something very informal. Maybe a once-a-month meet for a coffee or a pint. No club, no committee, no pressure.

I realize I may be jumping the gun here, but the roast profiles did not inspire confidence:

\-New SR800 with Razzo 12” tube with thermocouple

\-ambient T 35 F

\-230 g batch

\-various green coffees

\-preheat per Razzo suggestions, 10 minutes at F2, P9

\-Drying to 4:00 at F8-9, P9. This took me a batch to figure out because lowering fan resulted in not enough movement in the drying phase. 

\-The Maillard phase is where things really get tricky, and I have yet to get to a party-type rolling 1st crack. I keep the power at 9 for the entire roast, and try to push confidently  into 1C by dropping the fan according to movement. 08:00 I’m at about 365, and I can get a good 1C at about 11:30 with T 400 F. This seems like much too flat a RoR, which I can’t imagine not impacting the flavor. Am I wrong?

\-Develop for about 1:30 with increasing temp with lowering fan settings, again based only on sufficient bean movement. 

\-Drop at about 14:00 with T 415 F

\-Result City to City+ even roast. I’m roasting explicitly for espresso. I’d like to get to full city. 

As I write this I’m thinking I may need to lower batch size, if it’s even possible to get a quality roast in these temps. Lowering batch size is counter to one of my primary reasons for going SR800+.

(Get it? Because it sends a 'chill' down your spine? Spooky, I know 🤫)
❄️ Chilling Pack (New Special Pack)
🧊 What Makes It Special????
The Chilling Pack stands apart from all other packs by focusing on choice and resource control, not XP.
 Choice Scrap Card (Signature Feature)
Instead of one scrap card, the pack contains a splitting scrap card
When scratched, it duplicates into two separate scrap results
You reveal both rewards, then:
✅ Choose ONE to keep
❌ The other is discarded
Example:
Option A: Sparky
Option B: Ogre
→ You pick the one you want most
This fits the “chilling / calculated” theme perfectly—cold decisions, no randomness panic.
☕ Coffee Instead of XP
Chilling Packs do NOT grant XP
Instead, each pack grants:
☕ 50 Coffee
If the chosen reward is a duplicate Phobie:
You gain an additional +25 Coffee
Total possible coffee: 75
This makes the pack:
Great for endgame players
Not a shortcut for leveling
Still rewarding even on duplicates
🛠️ Upgrade Cards
You can receive:
200–400 Upgrade Cards
Keeps progression moving without power creep
What do you think about this pack yet?♥️✨
Chilling Pack – Exact Drop Chances!!!
These chances apply per revealed option on the Choice Scrap Card
(remember: you see two, but only choose one)
 Base Reveal Chances (per option)
Result Type
Chance
Duplicate Phobie
30%
Common Phobie
35%
Uncommon Phobie
20%
Rare Phobie
12%
Ultra-Rare Phobie
3%
Total
100%
🧊 Why These Numbers Work
🔁 Duplicate – 30%
Higher than normal packs on purpose
Softened by:
+25 bonus coffee
The choice mechanic (you can avoid the duplicate if the other option is better)
Encourages coffee farming without frustration
⚪ Common – 35%
Still the most likely new pull
Keeps early/mid-game players progressing
Commons stay relevant due to upgrades
🟢 Uncommon – 20%
Respectable chance
Makes the pack feel premium
Often the “best choice” when paired against a common or duplicate
🔵 Rare – 12%
Slightly higher than standard packs
Balanced by:
No XP gain
No guaranteed rarity protection
Choice makes this feel very good when it appears
🟣 Ultra-Rare – 3%
Rare enough to stay exciting
BUT:
Seeing two options means the per-pack perceived chance feels higher
You still only get one
This keeps Ultra-Rares special without flooding the game.
🧠 Important Hidden Math 
Because you see two rolls, the effective feeling is:
Higher odds of at least one good option
Less frustration
More control
But mathematically:
You never exceed intended rarity flow
Devs stay safe
Anddddd, if I missed to mention something about the pack, feel free to ask!

Past midnight. Another ER shift. This woman walks in, won't even look at me.





She shifted her weight, face burning red. ""My husband likes trying new stuff in bed. This time he... yeah. Can you just... help me get it out?""





I'd seen this before. Too many times. Started to give her the usual talk.





But she kept going.





""I'm actually into it."" She bit her lip, almost smiled. ""He's really good to me. Whatever ends up there is always pricey. Like, I get it out, I keep it.""





She leaned in. ""So doctor—seriously, don't throw it away. Please?""





I wasn't planning on it.





But the second I pulled it out, my heart stopped.





A platinum diamond bracelet. Identical to the one on my wrist.





Engraved on the inside: GA.





My husband's initials.





I forced my voice to stay calm. ""Emergency contact. Fill it out.""





That's when I watched her write his name—





Grayson Ashford.





MY husband.





\---





I sat in my office the rest of the night, just staring at nothing.





By morning, I was a zombie. Walked outside, stood by the hospital entrance in Manhattan, not even sure where to go.





And that's when I saw her again—the woman from last night. She'd just finished her IV and was standing by the curb, waiting.





Until a car I knew way too well pulled up. Grayson rolled down the window and shot her this cocky grin.





""So, did you like where I put it?""





She nodded, all shy and giggly, then gave him this playful look.





Grayson didn't hesitate. Got out and slid his hand around her waist like it was the most natural thing in the world.





His whole vibe was different—loose, flirty. I'd never seen him like this.





My husband was supposed to be Manhattan's coldest CEO. Controlled. Untouchable.





Seeing him now? I didn't even recognize him.





Grayson and I had been married eight years. We got along fine, but he'd always been distant when it came to sex. We barely did it, and when we did, it felt like checking off a to-do list.





He used to joke about it. ""They say doctors see so many bodies, they end up not caring about sex anymore.""





""And you? Perfect example.""





I never thought sex was the only thing that mattered.





And never doubted that Grayson loved me.





""Pfft.""





I let out this bitter laugh—loud enough that Grayson heard.





He turned around. Our eyes met.





For half a second, panic flashed across his face. Then it was gone, replaced by that blank expression he always wore in public.





He walked over, voice flat. ""Get in. I'll take you home.""





I stared at him. ""Who exactly are you taking home, Grayson?""





His jaw tightened. He looked pissed.





The woman hurried over and grabbed his hand, fingers lacing through his like she was marking her territory. ""Babe, who's this?""





She turned to me with this smug little smile. ""Hi, I'm Brooke Sinclair. I'm—""





I didn't let her finish.





I slapped her. Hard.





The sound cracked through the air.





And then—another slap. This time across my face.





I grabbed my cheek, staring at Grayson like I didn't know him.





He looked down at his own hand, then back at me. ""You're way out of line, Harper.""





That stupid phrase he always used when he was pissed.





He'd said it to the girl who locked me in an abandoned gym in high school—right before he got her entire family blacklisted in Manhattan.





He'd said it to the colleague who stole my research—right before that guy mysteriously disappeared from the hospital.





He'd said it to his own mother when she dumped hot coffee on my head and screamed that I was a homewrecker for ""seducing her son.""





He'd grabbed the cup, smashed it on the floor, and said, ""Mom. Don't push it.""





Then took my hand and we walked out without looking back.





But now? Hearing those words aimed at me?





Felt like someone carved out my heart with a dull knife.





I turned to leave.





Grayson grabbed my arm and started shoving me toward the car.





Too rough. I stumbled, trying to catch myself—





That's when Brooke stuck her foot out.





I went down hard. Knees slammed into the pavement.





Pain shot up my legs like fire.





Brooke gasped, clutching her chest like she was in a soap opera. ""Oh my god! You didn't have to kneel just to say sorry!""





""I'm not petty like that. Just apologize and we're good.""





Grayson automatically reached for me.





But Brooke yanked him back. ""Babe, you always say don't spoil women, right?""





""Spoil 'em and they start thinking they're hot shit.""





""Walking around with that cold bitch act 24/7... it's annoying as hell.""





Grayson brushed his thumb across Brooke's lips. ""But you? You know your place.""





He still pulled me up—but this time shoved me into the car like I was cargo.





The whole ride back to our place in the Upper East Side, Brooke and Grayson acted like I wasn't even there—





She giggled.





He whispered in her ear.





Her hand stayed on his thigh the entire time…





I closed my eyes, trying not to lose it.





Grayson dropped me off first. Then drove away with her still in the car.





I walked inside. For a second, everything looked normal.





But it wasn't.





The throw pillows on the couch were a mess.





The vase on the counter was shattered on the floor.





Guess they got a little too into it.





I took a shower and collapsed into bed. When I rolled over, my hand hit something hard under the pillow.





A voice recorder.





Chapter 2





I pressed play.





Brooke's breathy moans filled the room. Then the wet sounds. The whispers. The bed creaking.





And then—





""Babe... do you love your wife?""





Grayson didn't answer right away. Just laughed softly.





Brooke pushed. ""Come on. Tell me.""





Finally, he spoke. Voice lazy, almost amused. ""Right now? I love you. So stop bringing her up. You're killing the mood.""





…





The bed felt disgusting. Like I could feel every trace of what they'd done.





I shot up, and that's when my phone rang. Unknown number. But I knew that voice.





""Babe... it hurts a little... but god it feels so good...""





Couldn't take it anymore.





I grabbed a bag, threw some clothes in, and ran out.





But I didn't get far.





Our household manager, Mr. Langford, stepped in front of me.





""Mrs. Ashford. Boss wants you at his mom's.""





He shifted uncomfortably. ""Said you've been causing problems. She's gonna deal with you.""





I froze. Started shaking before I could stop myself.





Grayson's mother—my adoptive mother—hated me.





She said I dragged her son down. Ruined his life.





Grayson was supposed to marry someone from a powerful family. Someone useful. Not some orphan she took in out of pity.





She called me shameless. Ungrateful. A leech.





Back then, Grayson stood between us. Fought everyone for me.





But that love? Dead and gone.





Now he regretted everything. Just couldn't admit it.





Because admitting it would mean his mother was right all along. That he'd been a fool.





The security guards dragged me inside the Hamptons estate.





Mrs. Ashford stood there, lips curled into this cold smile.





""Harper. I told you what would happen if you ever came crawling back here.""





Mrs. Ashford grabbed the riding crop and swung. It hit me so hard I gasped.





She didn't stop. ""You little slut! You went after my son!""





""We took you in! Gave you food, a place to live! And you threw it all back in our faces!""





""I'm gonna love watching you beg to come back!""





I screamed. Tried to run. But the guards held me down.





I wanted to beg. To say I was sorry. That I regretted everything.





But the words wouldn't come.





All I managed was a whisper. ""I'm sorry...""





Mrs. Ashford paused. Then swung again.





Finally, she threw the crop down. ""Lock her up. No food until I say so.""





""Stop!""





That voice.





For one stupid second, I thought—he came for me.





But then Grayson walked in.





And he kicked me in the chest.





I coughed, gasping for air, tasting bile.





He glared down at me, face twisted in rage.





""You bitch. How dare you do that to Brooke?""





Chapter 3





Grayson laughed—cold, bitter.





""You're a doctor. And you didn't even check if she was allergic?""





I stared at him, confused. ""What are you talking about?""





""Don't play dumb."" His voice was ice. ""You knew Brooke's allergic to certain painkillers. And you gave them to her anyway.""





""Were you trying to kill her?!""





I shook my head hard. ""I didn't! I would never screw up something like that! Grayson, you have to believe me!""





He grabbed me by the arm and dragged me out.





Behind us, Mrs. Ashford shouted, ""Wait—where are you going? She's supposed to be mine to deal with!""





Another mansion. Another nightmare.





Brooke was lying in bed, looking pale and weak. Her face was covered in red blotches—clearly an allergic reaction.





When she saw me, she sat up slowly, eyes filling with tears.





""Harper... I'll leave him, okay? Just stop hurting me.""





""I know you love him. I get it. But I can't keep watching him suffer because of me...""





Her voice cracked. She started sobbing.





""Please... I'm begging you... let me go. I'm scared. I don't want to die...""





Was she serious right now?





No matter how much I tried to explain, Grayson wouldn't listen.





He stepped closer, grabbed my chin, forced me to look at him.





""Whatever Brooke went through? You're about to get it ten times worse.""





He typed something into his phone. A minute later, a doctor walked in holding a syringe.





""Give her the injection. Cephalosporin.""





My blood ran cold.





""Are you insane?"" My voice came out shrill, broken. ""You know I'm allergic! That could kill me!""





Grayson smirked. ""Oh, now you care about allergies? Funny. You didn't seem to care when it was Brooke.""





I forced myself to breathe. Stay calm. ""Her reaction was mild. A rash at most.""





""But cephalosporin? For someone like me? That's lethal.""





""And I swear—I didn't give her those painkillers on purpose.""





Grayson's face softened. Just a little. ""So you're scared now. Good. Maybe—""





""Babe.""





Brooke's voice cut through the room.





She walked over, grabbed his hand. Grayson immediately steadied her.





""If you really want her to learn, you have to make sure she feels it.""





""The best way to teach someone? Let them experience the pain themselves.""





Grayson frowned.





Brooke kept going, tears streaming. ""I don't care what she does to me. But what if she does this to someone else? Someone who won't forgive her like I do?""





""She's a doctor. She can't abuse her power like this. And if word gets out? It'll destroy your company's reputation.""





Grayson nodded.





He turned to the doctor. ""Do it.""





I thrashed. Screamed. But they pinned me to the chair.





The needle pierced my skin.





""Grayson, you're insane! I want a divorce!""





He froze. Then laughed—low, bitter.





""Fine. But first, you're paying back what you owe Brooke.""





He leaned in close, voice dropping to a whisper. ""And Harper? Without me? You're nothing. So think real carefully before you keep talking.""





I stared at this man I thought I knew, yet so strange.





Then stopped fighting.





Everyone relaxed.





And then I smiled.





Ripped the IV out of my hand, lunged forward, wrapped both hands around Brooke's throat.





Her face turned purple. She kicked. Gasped.





Grayson yanked me off. I bit down on his wrist—hard. Blood filled my mouth.





He slapped me across the face. ""Let go, or I swear—""





I did.





Not because of his threat.





But because the drug was kicking in.





My legs gave out. The room spun.





Brooke coughed, clutching her neck.





She shoved Grayson's hands away and stumbled toward me, ready to grab my hair.





But before she could, everything went black.





When I woke up, I wasn't in the mansion anymore.





I was in the middle of nowhere. Dense forest all around.





""Well, look who's up. Call your husband. We want five million.""





I turned my head. Two men were squatting under a tree, staring at me.





Somewhere in the Catskills, maybe? No roads. No people.





I'd been kidnapped.





I swallowed my fear and nodded. ""I'll call him. Just don't hurt me.""





One of them snorted and tossed me a phone.





I dialed Grayson's number. Rang seven times before he finally picked up.





""I told you to stay with Brooke and think about what you did. Who said you could call me?""





My hands were shaking. ""Grayson... I've been kidnapped. They want five million—""





Silence.





Then his breathing. Sharp. Uneven.





""You—""





""Babe! Harper escaped!""





Brooke's voice burst through the line.





""She pushed me while I was napping! She said you'd believe her this time. Told me to wait and see.""





""Look—my knee's bleeding!""





""Harper!"" Grayson's voice exploded.





""You've really outdone yourself this time.""





""Faking a kidnapping to get my sympathy? You're pathetic.""





""Even now, you still hurt Brooke. You make me sick.""





I tried to explain. ""No, I swear, I really—""





""Oh, you're really kidnapped?"" He laughed. Cold. Cruel. ""Then I guess you can just die.""





With that, he hung up.





I called again. But line was dead.





""Damn it!""





One of the kidnappers swore and stomped toward me, face twisted in rage. ""No money? Fine. Guess we'll get something out of this.""





He grinned. ""You're gonna make this worth our time, sweetheart.""





I backed up. He didn't rush. He was enjoying this.





He reached for me.





I ran.





Wind roared in my ears. Behind me, the men laughed.





Until my legs gave out—





I tripped.





And fell straight off a cliff.





Above me, one of them shouted, ""Fuck! Are you crazy?! We didn't want to kill you!""

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

1q0ge5e,https://i.redd.it/2jhfzrpnbkag1.jpeg,Coral Convergence and it’s ambiguous implications are solved in the show Pluribus,"One of the biggest ambiguities in AC6 is what the Coral Convergence actually means for humanity, and ever since getting the true ending I’ve had a hard time wrapping my head around its implications. That is until I watched the show Pluribus. 

The main premise of Pluribus is that most of humanity has been assimilated into one singular mind made up of everyone’s consciousness. With the few fragments that we know about Coral, and joining it through Coral Convergence, I believe this to be the same concept. 

During her introduction, Ayre warns us that if we don’t wake up, our consciousness could be “forever scattered in the Coral flow”. The use of “scattered” here implies that our consciousness will no longer be singular, suggesting that Coral as a  whole is a hive mind, not made up of individual consciousnesses but rather a mix of them together.

This would then be the same as Pluribus, which leads me to the implications of Coral convergence. Once you join the hive mind, your own individuality is absorbed, and your free will disappears into one amalgamated will. All your individual hopes, dreams and suffering is gone; you ultimately lose your self. As the main character in Pluribus repeats, everyone assimilated is essentially “dead”. Though V.III O’Keeffe is talks about the loss of a physical self from Coral Convergence, he’s essentially approaching the same idea:

“You think you want Coral Release… but you don't. Shovel down your bland rations. Slurp your coffee-flavored sludge. Sure, it sucks--but that's being human.”

It’s not just the physical form of humanity that’s being lost with Coral Convergence, but the free singular mind as well.  

There are some contradictions to this; for example, Ayre appears to have a free singular mind in spite of being a part of the coral flow. This however, is only because she has been separated from it. As she states, we have not been scattered in the Coral flow, it is her that has been disconnected from it; we do not hear other voices of Coral, only hers. This is the same process that happens with every pilot that communes with Coral - they are not joining the flow, they are communing with a part of it broken off from the whole. 

I’d also like to address the difference between the Coral Convergence of Allmind, and the one that we release ourselves. Allmind’s very name shows the very same point about Coral as a hive mind; it is “All Minds” as one. However, there is a great irony here. Allmind is not a part of Coral. As a mechanical artificial intelligence, she will never be a part of the biological Coral, so what she seeks to do is to control it. Therefore her Coral Convergence is a way for her to create a hive mind that is under her sole control, meanwhile our version of it allows the Coral hive mind to be free. As Pluribus demonstrates however, this freedom is not the same we have as seperate, singular humans.

That’s about everything - there are plenty of contradictions that I’ve neglected and plenty of hyperbole I probably shouldn’t have used, but I still enjoy the potential that Coral Convergence is very similar to the hive mind in Pluribus. I probably haven’t explained the connections as best as I could have, so I’d recommend watching the show to see where I’m coming from. Any thoughts?",11,1767196890.0,armoredcore,4,0.82,False

1q0gcan,https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1q0gcan/a_summary_of_my_board_gaming_in_2025/,A Summary of My Board Gaming in 2025.,"Hopefully, this is allowed, as 2025 was a fun year for me. Lots of things happened in my life, but Board Games and Board Game Nights remained part of it the entire way through.

Late last year, I met my now girlfriend on an app. She had mentioned she liked board games, so like any board-loving person, I suggested we go to a local Board Game bar for our first date. Here is where I found out Board Games = Monopoly in her mind, and I promptly introduced her to 3 new games (Silver and Gold, Codenames Duet, and Jauipur)  2 of three were hits, and that was that. Shortly after we started frequenting MOX Boarding House in Chandler to play games from their collection, and at the same time, grow mine.

[Mox Boarding House - Chandler Arizona. Many nights spent here with a board game sprawled across a table, a glass of wine or coffee, and a rule book opened up.](https://preview.redd.it/lwjjscs5zjag1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5112b2d9d08e01c3fb7fb59704358de9c9bc3d81)

[Planted was a great introduction game, along with Summer Camp. Both Games were asked for early and often and I was incredibly happy to oblige. ](https://preview.redd.it/o1w1afwm1kag1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d48c5aaba15199324367db46a9bd5ce1ee23834d)

[The White Castle - She was not a fan, and didn't enjoy the tightness of the game.](https://preview.redd.it/mzo3mqsawjag1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=768e2154c72672a8f11a2d7cd6463b17d0c7b4a9)

[River of gold - Her first big game purchase. Some time during the year she even started buying her own games. I had officially become a player. I tried to get here to teach a few games, but she requested that I keep the role of teacher.](https://preview.redd.it/pb5wvihnyjag1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bb1c1f121f51edd13c249c2f3937e031c1bbb78)

[Concordia - She wants to play it again. Might just be too dusty for someone new to the hobby, still one of my favorites.](https://preview.redd.it/3yv180pfwjag1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96ec00fc97bd1a41999fc6042f9424ca4167bfc3)

[Great Western Trail was a hit that we played multiple times.](https://preview.redd.it/roy3da1izjag1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=366dce334b7e8050fb9dbf3955e745c491ddfa9c)

[Marco Polo - The Dice, and player powers were a hit. ](https://preview.redd.it/zuz8c8ghwjag1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb73f18b4cb16b7ff2838727df31d83b14d3b296)

[My Table Topper - At some point in 2025, I got interested in woodworking and bought entirely way too many tools. But in any case, I decided to build myself a new table topper. Previously, I used an old poker mat and then a wool blanket, but this addition has been great for our board game nights. It was also around this time that she moved in with me. This is before I routed the edges, stained, and added some poly. I still need to finish it! ](https://preview.redd.it/br5pp27g0kag1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1be17012dfa0c675fa1ac945303f52297c5d3780)

[She fell in love with Roll and Writes like Three Sisters, Motor City, and Welcome To. I showed her a video on YouTube, and her jaw dropped at the sheer opportunity of a game like The Anarchy, so we picked it up for her birthday. Finally, after several weeks, we pushed through a learning game, and it's become a favorite. ](https://preview.redd.it/0zpdt71hyjag1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77b6c65e04c50fb4b6f99a2df32d376d17015b07)

[Sunderfolk was another huge hit for us. I had played through JOTL previously, and own Gloomhaven first edition but it has always been a bear to set up. When I picked up Sunderfolk on steam and introduced it to them it became a hit. We played through the entire campaign in about 3 months. Easiest was using a wireless HDMI to stream from my PC to the living room TV.](https://preview.redd.it/aw0smn80ckag1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a138e0ece0575e938616b887b05ff4028761d05)

[Along with Ark Nova. Side note is that I travel a ton for work, leaving most of my in-person gaming on the weekend nights. Because of this, she and I started having weeknight games on BGA, which almost always started with Ark Nova, and then slowly wound down to Spots, or some other small filler game. This was a great way for us to stay connected when I was across the country. ](https://preview.redd.it/7v6tk11uzjag1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a06323fb9480da2a77ffba4843a52cb437ca08d)

[A Highlight for me was Thanksgiving. Funny story is my Dad recently retired, and has always had a fondness for board games. He went to my stepbrother's house and played Ticket to Ride. Riveted by the game, he went down a rabbit hole on YouTube, and landed on Ark Nova, being his favorite game \(Even though he had never played it\). He digested countless hours of strategy videos, and finally, over Thanksgiving, we got the chance to unwrap his copy to give it its inaugural play.  At the end of a grueling session, he came out on top, smoking both my Girlfriend and me by about 30 points. Needless to say we will be ready for our next play.  ](https://preview.redd.it/jqtj4fmu1kag1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8723cdef80a606312b57b6be8e00929df5e4d3b7)

[BG Stats Review - In total, I played 186 plays across 91 different games. She was there for 169 of those plays this year. And she has started to climb the BGA ladders on Ark Nova. In September, we ran through a pub meeple ranking of her favorite games so far, and it wasn't a shock to see Ark Nova at the very top. She leans towards games with combos and chances to make big plays. Next year, we plan on ranking on PubMeeple again to see any movement.](https://preview.redd.it/d6a1p73f4kag1.jpg?width=3105&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbb43375f4015b3d9c1653b68ea8e792035fd058)

[My Collection as it sits currently sits now. I am slowly running out of room, but am planning on a bigger shelving situation in the future. Of all my games I My top games I have played this year would be Hansa Tuetonica, Barrage, Great Western Trail, Beyond the Sun, Terra Mystica, and Under Water Cities. The biggest dud of the year for me goes to La Granja. The stop and go nature of our first play through felt extremely limited, and jarring at times. ](https://preview.redd.it/9tl35ay55kag1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab1324d27ae266ee3be321043430194516498ac7)

[Small Box Game Collection. I often catch flack for taking my photo case of small box games with me to parties, or the hockey rink for after games. Its a rare occasion that I get to break out a game, but when I can, I am ready. Nothing beats a group of adult hockey players playing Love Letter with a few pitchers of beer after a game. ](https://preview.redd.it/tkn2xkuu5kag1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7249fb2c23b6d172ff14fe2224d5502632b8110)

So that's it. We played a ton of games. My roommate was also there for a lot of it too can't forget him. We ran a gauntlet of different mechanics trying to determine her favorite ones. There were moments of burn out from learning new ones, but we managed to get through, and hopefully next year we will return to many of these. For her, several games didn't hold up. These were the White Castle, The Red Cathedral, Love Letter, and La Granja. I am trying to get White Castle, and Red Cathedral back to the table as I think they may have been due to a poor teach but who knows. She also prefers bigger games over smaller games. If she had a choice between a card game and a game with a board, she'd go with the board. I have also included some lists here.

**A Few games on our shelf of shame that we would like to get to are:**

* Hegemony, this is the first one I want to get to the table. I have an interest in governments, and I think the theme can be polarizing.
* Imperial Steam, another heavy rail game. She isn't thrilled about heavy economic games. Irish Gauge fell flat for her.
* Maricaibo - Picked this up from Facebook Marketplace, and just haven't had time to dive into the rules.
* A Gest of Robin Hood, still trying to convince her to learn it with me.

**I also received a few games for Christmas that I will have to get around to sooner than later:**

* Brass Birmingham
* Shackleton Base
* Yokohama
* RA
* Earth
* Magical Athlete
* Endeavor Deep Sea

**Our top games we played this year:**

* Ark Nova
* Lost Ruins of Arnak
* Great Western Trail
* Crown of Emara
* Beer and Bread

**Biggest Surprises:**

* Pan Am - Great auction/area control game. Really enjoyed this one.
* Combria - I didn't expect this to go over as well as it did, but it will be returning to the table soon.

The amount of leave each person uses is different, so I went with a conservative 48 weeks of RTO. Some may have to take family leave, have a chronic illness, etc. While on the other hand there are those that brag about never using vacation/sick leave.



If you are looking for a New Year's resolution then here are some ideas:



1.) Write to your [member of parliament](https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/search) about your costs of returning to office and explain that it is less time and money you have to spend in their riding.

Firstly, please excuse any ignorance on my behalf- I'm not a coffee-at-home person and am buying the corvo (studio pro) for gongfu cha style tea making. 

My old kettle finally kicked the bucket- but the thing I did love about it is how easy it is to just flick on with the lever.

Is the base of the corvo the same? You just press down on the dial? 

The TLDR of this whole post is this: I'm ***extremely*** passionate about right-to-own, right-to-repair movements, so I was tenative to buy this at all because I know the mechanisms and/or pcb inside the base would be harder to fix myself once the **generous** 3yr warranty expires and some very cheap replaceable component breaks. 

I love the idea of all of the customizable settings, but im wondering how much I would actually use on a daily basis, I am likely 99% of the time just want to hit a full boil (212F)  
and also if I NEED to be connected to wifi to use any functionality- ideally i wouldn't even CONNECT it to wifi, but with all of the settings like altitude and such. 

Following on this\^, is the LED dial on 24/7? Am I able to adjust brightness?

If it does stay on constantly, do I ever need to re-select the mode i'm on, or will it always stay on the 'screen' you last used? I hope that makes sense.

Unsure of what to do now.,"Throwaway because my sister follows my usual account. I (16f) live at home with my dad (43m), stepmom Liz (38f), and two half siblings (4m/1f). My full sister Anna (20f) is in college out of state, but is back in town for winter break, staying with our maternal aunt. For some context, our mom died soon after giving birth to me due to complications, and our dad raised us as a single parent until I was 9 and Anna was 14, at which point, he brought home Liz for us to meet, who he had been dating secretly for a year prior to this. From day one, Liz has never tried to replace our mom, but has gone out of her way to try to be someone who we can trust and rely on, whether it was trying to take an active interest in the extracurriculars we had, having fun days where she'd come to see us instead of just our dad (sometimes both, sometimes one of us), and take us out somewhere nice just to get to know us better. Before Dad and Liz got married, he sat down with each of us one-on-one to make sure that we were comfortable with the idea of their marriage and as far as I know, the both of us were, and when they got married when I was 11, both Anna and I were part of it. Now comes the problem. 

After Liz had our brother, Anna started accusing Dad of wanting to replace us, like he had already replaced Mom, and she'd get into these awful one-sided screaming fits at Liz, which ended up with Dad making the judgment call that Anna was no longer allowed to stay at our house during breaks, and Liz would no longer be attending any family events that Anna was. Since her and my relationship was still good though, he did allow her to pick me up so we could go shopping or to the movies together when she was in town. We never really discussed Liz together during these, though sometimes Anna would grumble about either her or our dad and I'd just brush it off because it's not my business, y'know? Well, fast forward to a bit before Christmas this year.

I'd gone with our grandma shopping for Christmas gifts and figured to wrap them at her house since that way I wouldn't have to worry about Dad or Liz seeing what I bought them accidentally. Things were going well, but then Anna and one of our cousins dropped by, and Anna must have noticed that the gift I had wrapped for Liz was labeled to Mom. She didn't say anything then, and I didn't even realize she had seen it, but then when we went to go get coffee this morning (the first time we've been alone together since then), we had started talking and got onto that subject, and things escalated until she was practically screaming, telling me how ungrateful I am since our real mom literally gave her life bringing me into the world, and how dare I take the imposter's side in all of this and call her my mom, I'm supposed to be her little sister, not the fake daughter in our dad's new family. I will admit I snapped at her, especially because I felt unsafe in such a confined space, and called her a f\*ed up b\*tch obsessed with a memory, at which point, she pulled off on a side road and made me get out and walk home. Since getting back home, I've been feeling conflicted. I know that Anna has been struggling with all this since Liz was pregnant the first time and that I should be more understanding that that's just how things are and it's unlikely to change. I also know she was somewhat parentified when it was just her, Dad, and me, and that does make it more complicated since again, she and I never had any real problems like this until today. She was always my big sister, and when Liz isn't a topic, everything's fine. I know I should probably talk to both Dad and Liz about this, but they're both at work. How do I go about discussing this even? I know I probably should apologize to Anna, since I did yell at her too. But where do I even begin? Liz has earned the mom role in my life, so I just have two moms. I don't know, I just feel guilty. Please help?",2,1767195628.0,whatdoIdo,3,1.0,False

Phase 0: Pre-2025

* I was ""in shape"" but wasn't ever challenging myself
* At the gym 2x per week, 3-mile walks with dog 2x week, weekly pick-up games
* Ate whatever I wanted

Phase 1: Jan - Mid March

* Initial cut, changes to diet were I stopped adding sugar to things (e.g., coffee, oatmeal) smaller portions, and less alcohol (down to 1-2 beers, 2-3x week)
* At least 30 mins strenuous cardio EVERYDAY
* Added a weekly swim and one more day at the gym
* Expected to lose 1% of weight per week (about 1.5 lbs/week)

Phase 2: Mid March through Oct

* Mostly maintenance
* Tried a final cut to a goal weight of 155, but got burnt out from being hungry all the time

Phase 3: Oct through end of year

* Focused on weekly improvements in weight lifting (adding reps to hypertrophy days, 5lbs/week to strength days in gym).
* Ate more good food, but still stayed away from added sugar
* Expected to add 0.5 lbs/week

Lessons learned:

* Alcohol does not help
* If using a digital scale, ignore the decimals; daily weights can fluctuate +/- 2 lbs
* If cutting expect to be hungry; know that you're not starving",3,1767195545.0,fitness30plus,1,0.71,False

Our first date afterwards lasted for 8 hours. We just talked. He told me that he really really likes me but nothing can become out of this become of this because i study abroad, and that long distance relationships dont work generally, but especially because we dont know each other. right. we agreed to stay friends and then when i come back for spring break we’ll meet up again. a few days afterwards we had another date, and he told me that he can’t be affectionate towards me because he’ll get attached. fast forward a few months, he kept talking about me to my friends, saying that im great and that he really liked me and that it really would’ve worked out. my friends and him are not that close btw. spring break came about, and i confronted him about the fact that he talks about me often. i told him that his behaviour is confusing. i then offered to spend the 2 weeks i was gonna be home basically together, and then end this for good. he rejected me, telling me again that he can’t, he’ll get attached and start thinking about a relationship, but i live abroad so that cant be. in november, so like 6 months after this happened, my friend told me that everytime he runs into him he asks about me, and that the last time it was obvious that he talked to her only for him to ask about me. now im back for the holidays, and he keeps liking my instagram close friend stories. i am sure he will not text me, although i do think he would be down to grab a coffee.

the thing is, i dont know if i should do this. i can’t believe that exactly one year has passed since this started out. ive been dating in the meantime, but this fucking guy has always been in the back of my mind. and when my friend told me that he is asking about me, it took me back to square one. i feel like im going crazy. i would maybe like to see him, but i also know that nothing more than platonic will happen. or at least im 98% sure. i feel lost and fed up with this. does anyone have any advice on this? it feels like it’s never ending and its eating me up alive.",1,1767195543.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

Hi all — I’m starting a small, peer-to-peer WhatsApp community for disabled and chronically ill adults in Western New York.

The goal is pretty simple: reduce isolation and make it easier to connect with other disabled people locally, without pressure to overshare, perform wellness, or be “active.” Lurking is completely fine.

This is not:

•	a crisis or therapy group

•	a medical advice space

•	an advocacy organization or service provider

What it is:

•	a low-pressure peer space

•	occasional sharing of local accessibility intel (venues, events, transit quirks, etc.)

•	optional social connection with people who understand pacing, unpredictability, and access needs

For context: I’m loosely replicating a peer group model I was part of in Denver that blended online chat with optional, volunteer-hosted meetups that were both virtual and in person. Some were simple (coffee, game night), others were more focused conversations (e.g., disability + religion). The key thing that worked was that nothing was mandatory and no one was expected to lead everything.

I’m intentionally keeping the scope narrow so it doesn’t become exhausting or emotionally demanding to participate in. There will be clear norms pinned at the top, and moderation expectations are minimal.

If you’re in WNY and this sounds useful, here’s the invite link:
https://chat.whatsapp.com/Jo9DQ8ehEjL1q7NwcE2AQ1

If it’s not for you, no worries at all — just wanted to offer something local that I’ve personally found hard to find.

But I’ll say in advance that I know how much I messed up, and that I realize I invaded her space too much at the beginning.

At the very end of November, I started questioning the relationship. She is 17 (trans fem) and I’m 19 (gay/pan?) now. I always went at her pace when it came to touch and physical intimacy, since she is asexual. We dated for almost 2 years; we would’ve completed 2 years in March 2026.

November 30:
After almost a week of feeling anxious, thinking about whether this was really what I wanted—especially because I found out she was questioning whether she was trans in the worst possible way (not directly from her, I heard it from someone else)—and because I thought I needed sex in the relationship and intimacies we didn’t have. That day, I hadn’t slept properly, I was under the effects of medication and with my head completely full, and that morning I decided to talk to her and break up. It was very peaceful and she understood. It hurt a lot for both of us, but it felt right to me at the time.
After a few hours, I started realizing that it wasn’t really what I wanted, that something was wrong, and I did something stupid: I asked to get back together. She stood firm and said she knew I would send that message, but that she wouldn’t come back, because she was already decided, and she doesn’t go back on important decisions, even though we loved each other more than anything. I felt absolutely terrible. From that day on, I did one therapy session per day until around the 22nd.

December 1:
In the morning, I woke up early, took our first ring, our first Polaroid photo, and went to her house with her mother’s approval. When we got there, we waited for her to wake up and I went into her room. She received me lying down, said nothing, while I was talking and crying, apologizing and saying how sorry I was; she was just on her phone. When I finished talking, she turned the phone toward me and showed that I was blocked on WhatsApp. I said, “Is that really it?” She nodded yes with her head, and I collapsed on the floor outside her room. Her mother and I cried together, because we also had a bond—she practically considered me a son.

December 2:
That day I don’t remember if I did anything; I think not. Just therapy and crying. But I remember that one of her friends came to insult me and say I was being immature. I agree with him in part, but there was no need to insult me.

December 3:
I sent her a message asking to talk, saying everything I was realizing in therapy, that I understood how wrong I had been. That the lack of sex wouldn’t be a problem, that her being trans wouldn’t be a problem. She compared me to someone who left our lives and was extremely toxic and a liar, and said I was starting to look like that person. Then she said I was immature and didn’t know how to deal with the consequences of my actions, and that she wouldn’t go back on her decision because a decision made is a decision made. She said I was trying to fix something that couldn’t be fixed anymore and that I should give up.
This completely broke me, really deeply, because to me all of this could have been resolved in a face-to-face conversation, or even a simple one—but she herself said, in so many words, that she didn’t want to see my side.
At the end of that day, I left our mutual groups. A childhood friend of hers who was also my friend came to ask why I left. I thought about whether to tell him or not, but I decided to tell him. He ended up realizing that it wasn’t worth it for her to decide to cut this bond and stay firm in that decision, and that both of us made mistakes, but that she didn’t see hers. So he, on his own, decided to go talk to her to try to show her that things weren’t that simple. And all she could think was that I had told him to go talk to her, even though I never told or asked him to do that—he decided to go because he was seeing how much she was sinking. He knows how much she struggles with anger and forgiveness.
That’s when things got even worse, because now she thinks I asked her childhood best friend to go talk to her. She insulted me a lot on Twitter, and I replied with screenshots proving that I hadn’t asked him to do that, and I asked to be blocked if she wasn’t ready to talk, and I was blocked.

December 10:
It was my birthday. It was a painful day, I think for her too. I had therapy that day as well (I think it was over 20 sessions in total), but before that I went out to celebrate with a friend, and she took me to a mystical place where a guy did a card reading—not tarot, but something else. I was never someone who really believed in that kind of thing, but everything he told me was way too specific, really specific. They weren’t things that could apply to just anyone. And he mentioned people that made sense.
That day, I decided to start writing a letter to her, saying everything she didn’t let me say. A letter of love, forgiveness, farewell—everything. I kept writing it over the days until the 18th; she would receive it on the 22nd.

December 11:
I saw that she went out to celebrate a mutual friend’s late birthday at a very hidden restaurant—the same place where we celebrated around 15 months of dating and that we loved. I sent her a message asking to be blocked on Instagram if she wasn’t ready to talk yet, because I didn’t want to see that kind of thing, and I know that if I blocked her, I’d eventually unblock her to see what she posts. She didn’t reply and just blocked me.

December 17:
I finished the letter—about 5 or 6 pages total. I talked about everything: the beginning, the middle, and the end. About everything I discovered about myself in therapy, the possibility of being pansexual, realizing that absolutely none of what I thought would get in the way would actually get in the way, everything I grew into and noticed as I wrote.
I also attached to the handwritten letter the receipts of the first thing I ever bought for her, even before we started dating—I’ve always kept that kind of silly thing, I loved her very much. I also attached a movie ticket I kept from the first film we watched together. I’ve always been that kind of boyfriend who keeps the silliest things to remember the person he loves the most. I had made a drawing of us, but I decided not to include it because it would be too much.

December 18:
I went to have coffee with her mother, to talk and deliver the letter and the Christmas gift. We came to a consensus that she would come back someday asking for forgiveness and realizing she was too extreme, but I don’t know if I believe that yet. We almost cried; all of this has been very hard for us, and she (my ex) seems like she isn’t suffering at all, or reflecting. Her mother said she thinks her daughter needs to suffer a bit more to really feel everything and reflect, but she doesn’t allow herself to feel. And with two friends by her side saying she is 100% right and that she made no mistakes, it becomes very complicated (the childhood friend I mentioned earlier is not included in this). One of them has an inflated ego and always thinks he’s superior, and the other has problems with drugs and alcohol.
We talked a lot, agreed that her daughter is being too extreme and stubborn, and in the end we said goodbye. She talked a lot with me during this time and we supported each other.

December 22:
The letter/gift was delivered. She set it aside at first and didn’t want to open it, but her mother told her not to do to others what she wouldn’t want done to her, so she opened it. Her mother even saw her reading the letter, but there’s no way to know if she read it all. The gift I gave her was two acrylic figures of characters we considered to literally be us. She put them on the shelf, and I was happy about that.
I later found out that the letter was kept in a drawer, and I didn’t receive any response from my ex. I also found out that our photos and things like that are in a drawer; she didn’t tear them up or throw them away. That day, I decided to give myself until the end of the 31st to wait for a response. Of course, if she comes back later I’ll always accept her with open arms, but I don’t know how long that will last. I won’t put my life on hold because of this. I’ll try to move on, even if only in practice.

December 31:
I wrote a final message to her mother. I cried a lot while writing it. I didn’t want any of this to happen, but it was good for realizing things I hadn’t noticed before. If we got back together now, I know it would be infinitely better. I’ll send the message to her mother at midnight, and after that, if we have a conversation, it will be the last one and I’ll cut contact. It won’t be healthy for me to keep talking to her mother, even though we have a very strong bond.
I don’t really know what to think. I see now how much I messed up at the beginning, and if I had left her at her own pace, without invading so much, she would have already come back. But I can only try to move on now, I think. I know I did my part: I reviewed everything I did wrong and sought change and healing. I’m still seeking it. I won’t stop next year.

But I think she could have acted with more calm and clarity, and not thrown away a beautiful 2-year relationship. I’m sure she listened to her friends who say I’m an asshole and childish. Anyway, I really don’t know what to think.",1,1767194927.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1q0flsi,http://buymeacoffee.com/cobotindustries/e/494055,Experiment: Packaging a local LLM into a standalone 'One-Click' script for non-technical users. How do you handle driver dependencies?,"Hey everyone,  
I’ve been trying to get my non-tech friends into local LLMs, but I hit a wall: the setup process. Even with things like Ollama being easier now, explaining terminal commands or driver updates to a complete beginner is still a hurdle.

I decided to try and build a fully pre-packaged, ""unzip-and-run"" environment.

**My approach so far:**

* **Backend:** I'm wrapping a quantized version of Ollama
* **Local Memory:** Remembers when you close the program and restart
* **Security:** Specifically designed it to be air-gapped/offline to appeal to privacy-conscious users who are paranoid about telemetry.

**The Challenge:** The biggest headache has been keeping the file size reasonable while ensuring it creates the right environment variables on Windows without triggering false positives in AV (since it's an unsigned .exe).

I’ve put the finished build up on BMAC for the price of a coffee for anyone who wants the convenience of skipping the setup, but I’m mostly curious—**has anyone else here tried distributing pre-packaged local environments like this?** I feel like ""portability"" is the missing link for mainstream adoption.

1q0flp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Booktrailerai/comments/1q0flp0/book_marketing_on_a_budget_free_strategies_for/,Book Marketing on a Budget: Free Strategies for Authors,"Marketing a book often feels like an expensive endeavor. Between paid ads, professional publicists, and sponsored placements, it is common to feel that successful authors are buying their way to the top. However, this is far from the truth. Some of the most effective book marketing strategies require zero financial investment (though they do require an investment of time and creativity).

You can effectively promote your work, build a loyal readership, and drive sales by leveraging digital platforms and building genuine connections. Whether you are a self-published author or traditionally published and looking to supplement your publisher's efforts, these strategies will help you build momentum without breaking the bank.

# Build Your Digital Foundation

Before you begin outreach, you must have a central hub where readers can find you. If a reader discovers your book on social media or through a friend, they will almost certainly look you up online. If they cannot find you, you lose the sale.

# Create a Free Author Website

Your website is the only piece of the internet you truly own. While social media algorithms change, your website remains constant. You do not need to hire a developer to get started. Platforms like WordPress, Wix, and Weebly offer robust free tiers that allow you to build a professional-looking site \[1\]\[5\].

Key elements your site needs:

* **About the Author:** A professional bio and high-quality photo.
* **Book Page:** Cover art, blurb, and purchase links to all major retailers.
* **Newsletter Sign-up:** The most critical asset for long-term sales.
* **Contact Form:** Make it possible for media or podcasters to reach you.

Once your site is live, use free tools like Google Analytics to track which pages engage your readers the most \[1\]. This data helps you refine your strategy over time.

# Optimize Your Amazon Author Central Page

Amazon is the world's largest bookstore, yet many authors neglect their Author Central page. This is a free profile that allows you to claim your books, add a biography, upload photos, and even share blog updates \[4\].

Keeping this page updated ensures that when a reader clicks your name on a book product page, they are met with a professional profile rather than a blank space. It establishes credibility and helps cross-promote your other titles.

For a comprehensive approach to structuring your online presence, check out our ultimate guide to creating a book marketing plan ([https://www.booktrailerai.com/blog/silos/01-book-marketing/how-to-create-a-book-marketing-plan-the-ultimate-author-guide](https://www.booktrailerai.com/blog/silos/01-book-marketing/how-to-create-a-book-marketing-plan-the-ultimate-author-guide)).

# Master Email Marketing

Social media reach is often throttled by algorithms (meaning only a small percentage of your followers see your posts), but email lands directly in a reader's inbox. Building an email list is widely considered the highest-ROI activity for authors \[6\].

# Create a Compelling Lead Magnet

Readers rarely sign up for a newsletter just to get ""updates."" You must offer value in exchange for their email address. This is called a lead magnet. Effective free lead magnets include:

* **The first few chapters** of your book.
* **A prequel short story** or an epilogue to your novel.
* **Character profiles** or deleted scenes.
* **Exclusive background content** about your research or world-building \[6\]\[7\].

# Newsletter Strategies

Once you have subscribers, nurture them. Do not treat your newsletter solely as a sales channel. Share your writing journey, book recommendations, and personal insights. Personalize your emails based on reader preferences (such as segregating lists by genre if you write in multiple categories) \[7\].

Include your book in your email signature. Every email you send to anyone, friends, colleagues, or business contacts, should have a small graphic of your book cover and a link to purchase it in the footer \[1\]. It is a subtle, non-intrusive way to spread the word.

# Leverage Social Media Organically

You do not need to be on every platform. It is better to choose one or two platforms where your target audience hangs out and master them \[2\].

# Video Content and ""BookTok""

Short-form video has revolutionized book marketing. TikTok (BookTok) and Instagram Reels allow authors to reach thousands of new readers without spending money on ads. The key is authenticity.

* **Share snippets:** Read a hook from your first chapter.
* **Behind the scenes:** Show your writing desk or your editing process.
* **Trends:** Participate in trending audio formats but twist them to fit the author niche \[1\].

Video content requires visual assets. If you aren't comfortable on camera, you can create compelling teasers using text and imagery. For authors looking to create high-quality video content quickly, create your book teaser with Book Trailer AI ([https://www.booktrailerai.com/create](https://www.booktrailerai.com/create)). It allows you to turn your book's concepts into cinematic visuals without needing complex video editing skills.

If you are specifically interested in viral strategies, read our TikTok book marketing guide ([https://www.booktrailerai.com/blog/silos/04-book-promotion/tiktok-book-marketing-guide-how-to-go-viral-with-story-snippets](https://www.booktrailerai.com/blog/silos/04-book-promotion/tiktok-book-marketing-guide-how-to-go-viral-with-story-snippets)).

# Instagram and Visual Storytelling

Instagram remains a powerhouse for authors. Post consistently leading up to your launch. Use ""Stories"" for casual daily updates and the main feed for polished graphics \[1\].

* **Takeovers:** Partner with other authors to take over their account for a day (and vice versa). This exposes you to their audience for free \[1\].
* **Pinterest:** Use Pinterest as a visual search engine. Create boards that reflect the aesthetic of your book. Pin graphics that link back to your book's sales page \[5\].

# Engage with Communities

Marketing on a budget requires shifting from ""broadcasting"" to ""networking."" The goal is to lead with generosity rather than sales pitches \[2\].

# Join Reader Groups

Identify where your genre's readers gather. This might be specific subreddits (like r/fantasy or r/romancebooks), Facebook groups, or Goodreads groups.

* **The Golden Rule:** Do not join a group and immediately post ""Buy my book.""
* **The Strategy:** Join discussions, answer questions, and offer recommendations for *other* authors' books. Become a known, helpful member of the community. When you eventually mention your own work (within group rules), the community will be far more supportive because they already know and trust you \[2\].

# Goodreads

Goodreads is essential for social proof. Ensure your author profile is claimed. Use the platform to run Q&As, participate in groups, and encourage readers to leave reviews \[4\]. While Goodreads has paid advertising options, its organic community features are robust and free.

# Collaborate with Other Authors

Other authors are not your competition; they are your best allies. Readers who finish a book in your genre are immediately looking for the next one.

# Newsletter Swaps

Find authors who write in your genre and have a similar list size. Propose a swap: you mention their book in your next newsletter, and they mention yours in theirs. This is one of the most effective ways to find dedicated readers because a recommendation from a trusted author carries significant weight \[8\].

# Group Promotions

Services like BookFunnel or StoryOrigin (which have free or low-cost tiers) facilitate group promotions where multiple authors pool their books together on a single landing page. everyone shares the link, driving traffic to all participants \[1\]\[7\].

# Content Marketing and PR

You can build authority and visibility by creating content that draws readers in.

# Guest Blogging and Interviews

Reach out to book bloggers, genre-specific websites, and podcasts. Offer to write a guest post or be interviewed.

* **The Pitch:** Do not just ask to promote your book. Pitch a topic that provides value to *their* audience. For example, ""5 Tips for Writing Sci-Fi World Building"" or ""How Historical Fiction Authors Research"" \[5\].
* **HARO (Help A Reporter Out):** Sign up for the HARO newsletter. Reporters often look for experts to quote in articles. If you respond to a relevant query and get quoted, you often get a backlink to your site and a mention of your book \[1\].

# Advanced Reader Copies (ARCs)

Reviews are the lifeblood of book sales. Before your launch (or even after), send digital ARCs to book bloggers, Bookstagrammers, and BookTok creators.

* You are providing them with free content (your book) in exchange for an honest review.
* Be professional and respectful of their time. Check their submission guidelines before sending a request \[1\]\[7\].

# Create High-Impact Visual Assets

In a digital world, your book needs to look good to sell. You need more than just your cover; you need marketing graphics for social media, headers for your emails, and promotional banners.

# DIY Design

Tools like Canva offer free templates specifically for book marketing. You can create quotes from your book overlaid on atmospheric backgrounds, mockups of your book on a Kindle or coffee table, and announcement posts \[1\]\[5\].

# Book Teasers and Trailers

Video assets generally perform better than static images on social media algorithms. A ""book teaser"" acts like a movie trailer for your novel.

* **The Hook:** Focus on the central conflict or trope of your story.
* **The Format:** Keep it short (15-30 seconds).
* **The Tools:** You don't need expensive software. Book Trailer AI ([https://www.booktrailerai.com/create](https://www.booktrailerai.com/create)) creates stunning visuals based on your text prompts, solving the ""no budget, no skills"" problem for video creation.

To understand the nuance between different types of video assets, read our guide on hooks vs. trailers ([https://www.booktrailerai.com/blog/silos/01-book-marketing/what-is-a-book-teaser-the-ultimate-guide-to-hooks-vs-trailers](https://www.booktrailerai.com/blog/silos/01-book-marketing/what-is-a-book-teaser-the-ultimate-guide-to-hooks-vs-trailers)).

# Strategy Summary: The ""Generosity First"" Approach

The common thread among all these free strategies is value. Whether you are entertaining readers on TikTok, offering a free short story, or answering questions on Reddit, you are giving something before asking for a sale.

According to marketing experts, consistently providing value builds the ""know, like, and trust"" factor \[2\]. When readers trust you, they buy your book.

# Checklist for Zero-Budget Marketing:

1. **Optimize:** Update your Amazon Author Central and Website.
2. **Capture:** Create a lead magnet and put the sign-up link everywhere.
3. **Connect:** Spend 15 minutes daily engaging authentically in reader groups.
4. **Create:** Post consistent, value-driven content on one social platform.
5. **Collaborate:** Set up one newsletter swap for next month.

# Conclusion

Marketing on a budget is not a disadvantage; it is an opportunity to build a deeper, more organic connection with your readership. By focusing on free strategies like email marketing, community engagement, and smart content creation, you can achieve sustainable growth that rivals expensive ad campaigns.

Start small. Pick two or three strategies from this list and implement them consistently. The most expensive resource you will spend is your time, so spend it wisely on activities that build long-term relationships with your readers.

1q0flfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/upstate_new_york/comments/1q0flfb/western_new_york_disabled_chronically_ill_folks/,Western New York disabled / chronically ill folks — low-pressure peer community (not therapy),"Edit: some asked for a fb group so I created this too: https://www.facebook.com/share/g/17zunbVCUx/?mibextid=wwXIfr

Hi all — I’m starting a small, peer-to-peer WhatsApp community for disabled and chronically ill adults in Western New York.

The goal is pretty simple: reduce isolation and make it easier to connect with other disabled people locally, without pressure to overshare, perform wellness, or be “active.” Lurking is completely fine.

This is not:

•	a crisis or therapy group

•	a medical advice space

•	an advocacy organization or service provider

What it is:

•	a low-pressure peer space

•	occasional sharing of local accessibility intel (venues, events, transit quirks, etc.)

•	optional social connection with people who understand pacing, unpredictability, and access needs

For context: I’m loosely replicating a peer group model I was part of in Denver that blended online chat with optional, volunteer-hosted meetups that were both virtual and in person. Some were simple (coffee, game night), others were more focused conversations (e.g., disability + religion). The key thing that worked was that nothing was mandatory and no one was expected to lead everything.

I’m intentionally keeping the scope narrow so it doesn’t become exhausting or emotionally demanding to participate in. There will be clear norms pinned at the top, and moderation expectations are minimal.

If you’re in WNY and this sounds useful, here’s the invite link:
https://chat.whatsapp.com/Jo9DQ8ehEjL1q7NwcE2AQ1

If it’s not for you, no worries at all — just wanted to offer something local that I’ve personally found hard to find.

Happy to answer questions in the comments.

1q0fkch,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoroccoLGBT/comments/1q0fkch/i_dated_a_nigerian_who_came_for_afcon_and_it_was/,"I dated a Nigerian who came for AFCON, and it was a great experience.","So Nigeria is playing here in Fes. I got a message on Grindr from a Black guy who wanted to get to know me. I told him about myself, and he told me that he was in Fes to watch his national team and that he wanted a partner for this period. He sent me some pics — a handsome guy in his late 30s. I sent him mine, and he liked me, so we decided to meet that same day in the old medina.
We met and walked through the old medina while talking. He told me that he was in love with the culture and asked me to suggest some local food. I suggested pastilla or djaj mhamer. He told me he had already tried pastilla, so we ate djaj mhamer. He paid, and he also bought us coffee while we talked.
We started talking about our date, and he told me that he liked me and wanted me to be like his boyfriend while he was in Morocco. I accepted (say I’m medloul if you want, but he is so hot). He told me that he wanted me to stay with him the whole time, like real partners. I said yes, and then he suggested going to his Airbnb, which I accepted.
His Airbnb was in a good area (Prestigia). I felt safe with him, honestly. We entered the apartment, and he gave me a piece of something they call “baba dudu.” It’s a sweet candy that tastes like coconut, or something similar, with coffee. I was a little shy, but he came and sat beside me and started touching my hair and my face. We kissed. He asked me if I was ready or if I wanted to go to the bathroom first. I told him I was clean but needed to go because we had been walking a lot. He said yes, me too.
I went to the bathroom, and he went to the bedroom bathroom. I cleaned myself and then went to the bedroom, where I found him waiting for me wearing only shorts (oh my God, his body is art). We started kissing and talking about our experiences. He told me he is bisexual and that his last experience was with a woman, but now he feels more into being gay.
After a few minutes, we started the fun (you know what I mean). After two great rounds, we finished and then went to eat at a restaurant close to the house (La Grillardiere).
At night, we had a little more, but he likes to sleep early, so not that much. I stayed awake until 3 a.m. watching movies. I woke up around 12 and didn’t find him in the house, but I found some Moroccan ftour. Around 1 or 2 p.m., he came back and bought me some men’s clothes, and also some female clothes. He bought three string thongs, one with a bra, and a hot female short. He told me that he wanted me to wear them while we were at home, so I did, and we had a very long day of fun.
The day after, we watched Nigeria vs Tunisia at the stadium. Our days became almost the same: food, fun, football, and movies. We went to Ifrane for one night, and we also watched yesterday’s game there.
Now I’m writing this after a great morning with him. I feel like I’m in love, I swear. The idea that he will travel back to his country soon makes me nervous. I just want to be with him. He is so nice, well-educated, athletic, everything you want in a top, honestly. But I will accept the fact that this is only for a short period.",2,1767194779.0,MoroccoLGBT,0,1.0,False

1q0fk5h,https://i.redd.it/mlc2p8x95kag1.png,"Surprise, Snakes. I Rose From the Ashes","Chapter 1





The last ride of my shift was my ex-husband. The one I hadn't seen in seven years.





He'd changed. Designer everything. The watch on his wrist alone was easily five figures.





Through the window, he yanked off his sunglasses. His voice came out strangled.





""Jenna? You're... alive?""





I looked away. Tugged my mask higher up my face. Kept my voice flat.





""Pickup for Monroe?""





Rhys Monroe slid into the passenger seat. His eyes never left me.





The look on his face—complicated didn't cover it.





""You got out of Lakewood Psychiatric. Why didn't you come find me?""





His voice faltered. Just for a second. A tremor he couldn't quite hide.





""All these years... have you been okay?""





I didn't answer.





I just pulled down the mask.





The burn scars covered half my face. Melted away the person I used to be.





Seven years in that place had done what time alone never could—it killed every last shred of love I'd ever felt for Rhys Monroe.





And all the hate, too.





...





Rhys stared at me the whole drive.





A few times, he opened his mouth like he wanted to say something.





But every time he looked at my face, the words died.





Finally, he dropped his head. His voice came out barely above a whisper.





""After the fire… I looked for you.""





I kept my eyes on the red light ahead. One hand on the wheel. Said nothing.





His lips trembled. He still wasn't ready to let it go.





""Search and rescue combed the whole building. No survivors. We all thought you were dead.""





My grip tightened on the wheel.





Funny thing—hearing people talk about your own death like it's a done deal.





I gave him the bare minimum.





""Still here.""





Rhys noticed. The distance. The ice in my tone.





He clenched his fists. Whatever he wanted to say, he swallowed it.





The silence in the car felt heavy. Suffocating.





I followed the GPS into one of those gated neighborhoods downtown. The kind with fountains and doormen and BMWs in every driveway.





Before he even got the door open, I heard her—a little girl's voice, bright and breathless.





""Daddy! Mommy and I missed you! You said we'd go to the park today!""





She came running, pigtails bouncing, and launched herself into Rhys's arms.





He smiled. Kissed the top of her head.





""Tomorrow, sweetheart. Pinky promise.""





Seven years.





Rhys got married. Had a kid. Built a whole new life that looked nothing like mine.





Then I saw her—standing a few feet back. His wife.





She was smiling. Until her eyes landed on me.





I watched the shock ripple across her face.





""Jenna?"" Her voice came out thin. Shaky. ""You're… still alive?""





Everyone seemed so shocked I was breathing.





And none of them seemed glad about it.





Camille slipped her hand into Rhys's and tugged their daughter forward.





""Anya, honey, say hi. This is Mommy's old teacher.""





My fingers tapped the steering wheel. Once. Twice.





Something cracked open inside my chest.





That name.





Rhys and I had chosen it together. Back when we thought we had forever.





A boy, we'd name Miles. A girl—Anya.





He'd spent three nights with a baby name book on his lap, testing them out loud, writing lists on napkins.





We never got to use either one.





I was still zoned out when the little girl looked up at me and saw the burns. The melted skin. The ruined face.





She screamed.





Rhys swept her into his arms, shushing her, one hand cupped over her eyes.





Camille's smile widened. When she turned to me, her eyes practically glittered.





""I'm so sorry, Jenna. She's only five. You must have really frightened her.""





She tilted her head, voice dipped in sugar.





""Why don't you come inside? We haven't caught up in forever.""





I didn't move.





Didn't give her the satisfaction of a reaction.





Funny how things change. This was the same girl who used to show up to studio in secondhand jeans and borrowed coats.





Now she lived behind gates with a fountain in the driveway.





When I didn't answer, her smile slipped. She ducked her head, voice going soft. Apologetic.





""Jenna... you're not mad, are you? That I married Rhys?""





""You disappeared for seven years. He stared at your photo every single night. I couldn't just watch him fall apart. So I—""





I cut her off.





""Why would I be mad? I don't even know you.""





Her face went stiff. Rhys took a step closer.





I saw the guilt flicker across his face.





""I know you're angry. What happened back then—I can't—""





He wanted to explain. But whatever he said, it wouldn't matter.





""If you need help now... money, a place to stay, anything—I'll take care of it.""





""I'm good. Thanks.""





Maybe once—back when they first threw me in that place—I would've taken it.





Every night in Lakewood, I begged anyone who'd listen. Let me call him. Just once. Please.





But now?





Why would I expect anything from the man who put me there?





Chapter 2





After I dropped them off, I parked a few blocks from my place.





Close enough to walk. Far enough that I didn't have to think.





I tugged my mask back up and kept my head down. Easier that way. Fewer stares.





I wasn't paying attention when someone crashed into me.





""Jesus—watch where you're going! What is wrong with your generation?""





The voice was sharp. Familiar.





I froze.





My throat closed up.





I looked up.





It was my mom.





She looked right at my face—the burns, the scars—and didn't know who I was.





Her nose wrinkled. She took a step back.





The woman next to her tugged her sleeve.





""Let's go. Bad luck.""





I stood there, numb, as they walked away.





Seven years. My mom had more gray hair now. A few more lines around her eyes.





But everything else? Exactly the same.





Cold. Sharp. Mean.





The wind cut through my jacket. I wrapped my arms around myself and speed-walked the rest of the way home.





The apartment was quiet. It had been just me for days.





I shrugged off my coat.





When I passed the bathroom mirror, I caught a glimpse of my back—thick, twisted scars running down my spine.





The worst one, right between my shoulder blades?





My mother carved it there herself.





Her version of a disownment letter.





The Sterling family had produced chess champions for eight generations straight. Every single one a legend.





All of them sons.





Then they got me. A daughter.





My mother didn't hide her disappointment. Everyone whispered that I'd be the one to ruin it all—that the Sterling legacy would die with me.





Except I had a gift.





The kind people call generational.





By twenty-four, I'd won thirty-two international titles. More trophies than shelf space. Sponsorships. Magazine covers. The whole deal.





Only then did they admit it—I'd surpassed my father. Even my grandfather.





That same year, I married Rhys.





Everyone said I had it all.





And for a while, I believed them. That all the late nights and pressure had been worth it. That I'd finally earned my happy ending.





Then I met Camille.





She was a broke college kid who couldn't make rent, let alone tuition. So I helped. Covered her classes. Taught her chess. Brought her into my life like family.





Camille was smart. She knew exactly how to win over my mom. How to make Rhys feel needed.





But little by little, things shifted.





At first, Rhys just mentioned her more. Casual stuff.





Then he started making her lunch every day. Remembering how she took her coffee. What she liked for breakfast. Her favorite takeout order.





When I asked about it, he brushed it off.





""She's your student, Jenna. I'm your husband. We're all family. The girl's been through hell. It's the decent thing to do.""





I wanted to believe him.





God, I tried.





I was three months pregnant when the bleeding started.





I called Rhys. Ten times. Twelve. No answer.





By the time my mom got to the hospital, she slapped me hard.





Screamed at me for losing her grandson. For letting the Sterling name die again.





I'd just lost my baby. Nobody hurt more than me.





Rhys didn't show up for three days.





When he finally walked into my hospital room, Camille was right behind him.





Her neck was covered in red marks. Her cheeks were still flushed.





Rhys dropped to his knees beside my bed and grabbed both my hands.





""Camille had a reaction to something she ate. They had to rush her to the ER. She almost didn't make it, Jenna.





""She doesn't have anyone else here. She was alone and terrified. I couldn't just—





""I didn't know. About the baby. Jenna, I swear to God, I didn't know. I'm so sorry.""





He buried his face against my waist and sobbed.





I sat there, numb, my mother's handprint still throbbing on my cheek. Staring past him. At her.





That wasn't food poisoning.





Those were hickeys.





That day, I suddenly realized that I didn't just lose my baby.





...





The shock of cold water against my face yanked me back to the present.





I turned the shower on full blast.





Let the freezing spray hammer down on my back, right over the scars.





I stood there until my skin went numb. Nearly an hour.





By the time I got out, everything was red and swollen.





My phone buzzed on the counter.





\[Mom's 70th is Saturday. I'll come get you.\]





No name in my contacts. Didn't need one. I knew it was Rhys.





I stared at the screen until the words started to blur.





After I got out of that place—after I crawled out of the fire—I spent so many nights awake, asking myself the same question over and over.





What did my mother see when she looked at me?





A daughter?





Or just a tool? A trophy machine. A cash cow with a chess board.





I looked down at my phone.





My thumb hovered over the keyboard for a long time.





Then I typed two letters.





\[OK.\]





Chapter 3





Two days later, I was in the back seat of Rhys's car, watching the city scroll past my window.





Camille twisted around from the passenger seat, her voice all sugar.





""Honestly? I'm surprised you said yes.""





I didn't answer.





Rhys kept checking on me in the rearview mirror.





The car went quiet. Just the sound of Anya breathing in her car seat, fast asleep.





Rhys cleared his throat.





""So, uh—Camille..."" His voice came out tight. Uncomfortable. ""Mom made her her goddaughter.""





My hand froze against the side of my face.





I looked down. Didn't say a word.





...





Mom's seventieth was at the Rosewood Grand—the kind of place where everyone's either rich or important.





Old money. New money.





The glass doors caught my reflection—baggy coat, scars climbing up my neck like vines.





I stuck out like a stray dog at a gala.





I trailed behind Rhys.





Heads turned. Voices dropped to whispers.





Then my mother swept into the lobby.





The second she saw Rhys—and the little girl in his arms—her whole face softened.





She smiled like she hadn't smiled in years.





""Mom."" Rhys stepped forward. ""I brought Jenna back. She's alive. She made it out.""





He paused, then added quickly, ""I thought—she should be here. With family.""





I glanced at him. At the way he was scrambling to justify this.





It was almost funny.





Was this about easing his guilt? Or did he actually believe I belonged here?





I wasn't sure even he knew.





My mother's gaze slid over to me.





No surprise. No relief. No tears.





Just cold, hard disgust.





""I don't have a daughter who looks like that.""





I'd known she'd say it.





But it still knocked the air out of my lungs.





""Mom—""





That word. I hadn't said it in seven years.





...





The last time was right before my birthday. At what turned out to be my final match.





I was playing Camille.





The game was broadcast live. Millions streaming online.





My mother sat front row, same as always.





Except this time, she wasn't watching me.





Her eyes kept drifting to Camille's side of the board. Nodding along. Mouthing encouragement.





Rhys was the same way.





Nobody wanted me to win.





I played like I had something to prove. Camille couldn't keep up.





Then halfway through, she stopped the game.





She looked at me, shock written all over her face.





""Jenna... did you cheat to win this?""





Her words echoed through the entire hall.





My hand froze mid-move. I looked up at her in disbelief.





The refs signaled a timeout. Walked straight over.





""Ms. Sterling, we're going to need your cooperation.""





They patted me down. Went through my jacket.





Then from the inner pocket, they pulled out a black pawn.





Rhys had packed that jacket for me.





My ears started ringing. I shook my head.





""I didn't...""





Cameras swarmed. Flashes went off like fireworks. I couldn't see.





The officials didn't even deliberate. They disqualified me on the spot.





My mother charged onto the stage.





She slapped me so hard my vision blurred.





Her voice came out cold. Venomous.





""I didn't raise a cheater.""





By morning, I'd gone from chess prodigy to national embarrassment.





I ran. Shoved past the reporters and bolted out the back exit.





I needed to find Rhys.





I needed him to tell me this was some kind of mistake.





I tore down the service hallway, my heels clacking on concrete, chest heaving.





Then I stopped.





What I saw made my blood go cold.

Dear K,

I have a long list of resolutions for the coming year, and at the very top is this: to shut down every daydream of you.

There’s a quiet melancholy in accepting that I won’t ever feel what I felt in those dreams—dreams that were entirely fictional. In them, I was accepted, seen, admired. You were the man for me, and I was unconditionally chosen.

But it’s time to wake up and smell the coffee.

The man in my dreams—strong, solid, accepting—is who I wished you were, not who you actually are. Holding on to that version of you is costing me every day . It’s blurring my ability to look elsewhere, to be open to someone real. Those imagined feelings are beginning to leak into real life, and I can’t allow that anymore.

I don’t want to think about you everywhere I go. I don’t want you woven into my music, my routines, my quiet moments. I’m ready to cut off anything that keeps you alive in my head.

I could say I wish you a good life—but I’d by lying

1q0fj5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/1q0fj5h/western_new_york_disabled_chronically_ill_folks/,Western New York disabled / chronically ill folks — low-pressure peer community (not therapy),"Edit: I created a fb group in case that works better for folks: https://www.facebook.com/share/g/17zunbVCUx/?mibextid=wwXIfr 

Hi all — I’m starting a small, peer-to-peer WhatsApp community for disabled and chronically ill adults in Western New York.

The goal is pretty simple: reduce isolation and make it easier to connect with other disabled people locally, without pressure to overshare, perform wellness, or be “active.” Lurking is completely fine.

This is not:

•	a crisis or therapy group

•	a medical advice space

•	an advocacy organization or service provider

What it is:

•	a low-pressure peer space

•	occasional sharing of local accessibility intel (venues, events, transit quirks, etc.)

•	optional social connection with people who understand pacing, unpredictability, and access needs

For context: I’m loosely replicating a peer group model I was part of in Denver that blended online chat with optional, volunteer-hosted meetups that were both virtual and in person. Some were simple (coffee, game night), others were more focused conversations (e.g., disability + religion). The key thing that worked was that nothing was mandatory and no one was expected to lead everything.

I’m intentionally keeping the scope narrow so it doesn’t become exhausting or emotionally demanding to participate in. There will be clear norms pinned at the top, and moderation expectations are minimal.

If you’re in WNY and this sounds useful, here’s the invite link:
https://chat.whatsapp.com/Jo9DQ8ehEjL1q7NwcE2AQ1

If it’s not for you, no worries at all — just wanted to offer something local that I’ve personally found hard to find.

Happy to answer questions in the comments.

I set a route and start riding. I get to a coffee stop and change my mind about where I want to go next. Can I go back into the app and either add a stop or change the destination mid-ride? Ideally both. 

Neither seems to be possible, unless I’m just missing it? Do I’m really need to stop the route and start another one? Seems weird. ",1,1767194682.0,beeline,0,1.0,False

ISO for female friends close to my age to talk about life and whatever is on our minds. I'm married, no kids (2 dogs), work full-time and in school (college/uni), and live in the USA (PST). Low-key kind of a boring person, but I enjoy getting to know people. 

I like some video games, reading, anime, coffee, testing out restaurants and cuisines, finding fun bars or speakeasies, travel, exploring new cities. I'm not big on talking about politics, not a sports girly, and I don't take things too super seriously. I'm happy to hear you out of you need to vent, but consistent constant negativity and complaining will turn me off.

But back to now its christmas break and have been feeling horrid for weeks now and idk why and it has never been this long and sleep schedule is fucked af And like i dont think im really worth anything there is a 60% id press a button that would kill me and nade everyone i know forget me maybe even a higherb chance now like whats my life worth laying in bed gaming and jerking off well what a life im living And idk what to do with it I also hsd somr certain toughts if u catch my drift mentiomed it to both my mom and councelor snd were look for therappy now But i just dont know what to do with it i feel absolutely missareble

And 2 more things I feel like im not allowed to feel better like when i feel a tad bit better and then gets worse again i feel like im not allowed to feel beter And talked with the councelor about this she said sje knows what i mean she has had a depression and burnout a few years back and she siad maybe thats because this is ur new normal now or feels like my new normal

And i feel like im subconsiously making myself feel this way? Because when i have short sudden spikes i feel better and then crash into oblivion again i think but i can still feel better which makes me think im subconsciously making myself feel this way eventough i dont think i am

and sometimes eventough im laughinh like i went to the neighbors with my dad we have a good relation with them my dad does things for them like laying new floor boards hanging tv etc and we just drank some coffee it was decent and i did feel a bit better but i still felt bad inside

and at the location i go to there is a girl 16 i mean were fine with each other play some pool usually etc but she goes out gets drunk etc and im like damn id like to expiernce it but i cant so to speak for lack of a better word

I just need some tips

and maybe tips on letting go of the friendship thing like that it didnt become anything it is what it is im fine with it but how do i let go because i just kinda keep thinking was it me or was it really to much for him

I am not a Bungie dev or a data miner. I’m just a bored guy on his couch drinking coffee and rambling about his nerdy obsession.

1. “Bind the Nine” means to bind each member of the Nine to a person like VI and Bael have done because when VI is bound to Bael he cannot interfere with time allowing everyone to “make our own fate.”

2. The next major DLC will follow us searching for those worthy to be bound to a member of the Nine.

3. The guardian will be bound to a member of the Nine. That member being IX.

4. We will visit Mercury and/ or the Infinite Forest, the Cosmodrome, and Old Chicago in Shadow & Order.

5. The 6th subclass that we obtain in the DLC where we bind the Nine will not be a paracausal power but whatever force corresponds with the rules of the Flower Game from the Unveiling lore book.

6. Despite III being dead we will still have to bind the power of III to a individual

1q0fg52,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1q0fg52/western_new_york_disabled_chronically_ill_folks/,Western New York disabled / chronically ill folks — low-pressure peer community (not therapy),"Hi all — I’m starting a small, peer-to-peer WhatsApp community for disabled and chronically ill adults in Western New York.

The goal is pretty simple: reduce isolation and make it easier to connect with other disabled people locally, without pressure to overshare, perform wellness, or be “active.” Lurking is completely fine.

This is not:

•	a crisis or therapy group

•	a medical advice space

•	an advocacy organization or service provider

What it is:

•	a low-pressure peer space

•	occasional sharing of local accessibility intel (venues, events, transit quirks, etc.)

•	optional social connection with people who understand pacing, unpredictability, and access needs

For context: I’m loosely replicating a peer group model I was part of in Denver that blended online chat with optional, volunteer-hosted meetups that were both virtual and in person. Some were simple (coffee, game night), others were more focused conversations (e.g., disability + religion). The key thing that worked was that nothing was mandatory and no one was expected to lead everything.

I’m intentionally keeping the scope narrow so it doesn’t become exhausting or emotionally demanding to participate in. There will be clear norms pinned at the top, and moderation expectations are minimal.

If you’re in WNY and this sounds useful, here’s the invite link:
https://chat.whatsapp.com/Jo9DQ8ehEjL1q7NwcE2AQ1

If it’s not for you, no worries at all — just wanted to offer something local that I’ve personally found hard to find.

Happy to answer questions in the comments.

However, seeing someone's USA vs France budgets may help others figure out what to expect here if they're trying to move. Feel free to ask any questions if you have them.

**Context**: I lived nomadically in the US prior to getting an apartment in Philadelphia February 2024. I lived in that apt until the end of January 2025, and I got to Paris the first week of Feb 2025.

I mailed boxes of my things from Philly to Paris (0 out of 10 don't recommend). I rented an Airbnb for 1 month before getting here, didn't find an apt in time so I renewed the Airbnb for a 2nd month. I found my apartment (a Paris suburb) by the end of March 2025.

I was able to move here with an education visa by signing up for a 20hr/wk French class. This class was expensive (but I think worth it). I was A1 when I got here and I'm a strong B1 now. Being able to talk to strangers in cafés, the gym, etc... greatly increased how much I'm enjoying living here. Hopefully I only continue to get better.

If you remove the Education category from both years, then my yearly costs increased $3,400 YoY. This feels like saying Philly and Paris have a roughly equal cost-of-living (for someone like myself with my preferences and purchasing habits).

Edit: for all of 2025 I kept my budget in US Dollars and each time I made a transaction I added the converted Euro to US Dollar amount on my transactions spreadsheet. I'm gonna keep the sheet in Euros next year ◡̈ ",13,1767194412.0,Expats_In_France,28,0.88,False

figured i'd share some parking tips for the wrestling tourney since it's an early 9:30 am start on friday, 01/02, which means you'll be hitting the usual commuter traffic on top of the event crowds. getting in isn't too bad if you time it right, but getting out can honestly suck.  
  
if you want to skip all that, check out \*\*Prked\*\*. it's an app where people rent out their driveways or garages, and the beauty is that you can often find a spot right next to the venue. it's usually way cheaper than lot fees if they charge them, you bypass the main entrance traffic headache, and it's a short, easy walk.  
  
for the venue lots, official parking at the rio rancho events center is \*abundant\* and generally free for most events, but always peek at the specific event page just in case they've slapped on a fee. they really stress arriving early for the best and closest options, which is extra important for a friday morning start like this.  
  
traffic-wise, the official directions say to use the \*\*KING\*\* or \*\*ARENA\*\* entrances off unser boulevard to save time. you really want to pay attention to this because unser is known for heavy traffic during big events, and there's currently widening/improvement work going on that can lead to temporary lane changes and added delays. getting \*out\* after the event is where most people report the biggest jam, so maybe grab a meal or coffee nearby before trying to exit.  
  
if the main lots fill up, which is possible for a full-day tournament, there's usually overflow parking available near the \*\*city of rio rancho buildings\*\* and the \*\*hp\*\* campus. since it's a weekday morning, be aware that these lots might be seeing their own regular business traffic, so official event parking should be your first priority. if you're stressed about parking costs changing day-of, you can always pre-buy a pass online too.  
  
my best advice for the 9:30 am start is to aim to be parked by 8:30 am. this lets you get ahead of the tournament rush \*and\* the normal morning work commute through the area.

1q0fa35,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1q0fa35/budget_grinder_advice_280eur/,Budget grinder advice [280EUR],"So because of where I live (Serbia) importing anything is pretty much not an option, you need to pay 20% VAT on the product + shipping price (at least 50 EUR) then 10% customs duty on that price and with certain shipping companies you need to pay for spedition as well (usually around 40 EUR). So the price for importing anything becomes the (product_price + 50) *1.2 *1.1 at the very least.

With that in mind I'm limited the options available in my country. The current candidates are:

* Baratza Encore ESP 220 EUR
* Fellow Opus 275 EUR
* DF54 v3 275 EUR
* Eureka Mignon Manuale 260 EUR

My main priorities are the quality of the grinder itself (quality as in resulting in the best shot) and reliability. The grinder not being too loud is a plus, but a loud one such as the Encore ESP isn't a deal breaker. Reliability is a big deal, cause I only get 1-2 years of warranty depending on the seller and none of these brands operate in my country so any extended warranty/costumer service these companies might offer would be hard to take advantage of. With all of that in mind I've sort of written off the Fellow Opus, cause I've seen plenty of people mention horrible retention issues.

I'm currently torn between the Mignon Manuale and the DF54. On one hand I'm a bit skeptical on the DF54 cause I've seen people mention QC issues, on the other hand it's pretty hard to find any review/comparison between the Mignon Manuale and all of the other grinders I've mentioned, so it's kinda been hard to form an opinion on it. 



**Location:** 	Serbia

**Preferred drink types:** 	The grinder will be used to make pretty much only espresso coffee, or espresso based milk drinks

**Drink frequency:** 	I'll usually pull at least 2-3 shots back to back and somewhat often it'll be 5 back to back

**Space:** 	No limitations

**Experience level:** 	Pretty new, but I'm looking to upgrade from a hand grinder I'm currently using, mainly because it's not sufficient for dialing in the coffee I usually drink (freshly roasted, mostly medium, medium-light roast) and because it takes too long to pull multiple shots back to back

**Manual or electric:**  Electric, for the reasons mentioned above

**Candidates:**

* Fellow Opus 275 EUR

But getting iced out by a pilot? That was a first.





The plane slammed onto the tarmac. I gripped the armrest so hard my knuckles turned white, my stomach lurching into my throat. I ripped off my headset, gasping for air.





The pilot was already stalking around the side of the plane.





His shoulders were locked tight. His face was stone cold. He was definitely the type that would make girls back home lose their minds.





But me? Zero interest.





Actually, I kind of wanted to punch him.





When I boarded, I'd been polite. I said hello. And him? He looked right through me like I was a smudge on his pristine window, then turned away.





Three hours in the air. The guy was a statue with a pulse. Aside from a cold ""Buckle up"" at takeoff, he hadn't said a word. When I finally asked how much longer, he shot me a look like I was speaking Alien.





Now, he hoisted my heavy suitcase Like it was an empty cardboard box.





I opened my mouth to say thanks, but he'd already grabbed my backpack with his other hand. He didn't even look at me. Just marched toward the metal shed.





I ran after him. ""Hey, you don't have to - ""





""Get the door.""





Wow. Charming.





Heat flared in my chest.





I wasn't helpless. I didn't need him showing off. His ""help"" felt more like an insult. Who cares if he was hot? His personality was absolute trash.





But I bit my tongue and picked up the pace to kick the door open.





I was here for a fresh start. No point letting some frostbitten jerk ruin it.





Not worth it.





Inside, the heat hit me. A woman in a thick down jacket hurried over. Evelyn Vale, the principal.





""You're finally here!"" She beamed, grabbing my hand. ""I hope Cormac didn't talk your ear off.""





She winked at the ice block standing behind me.





Cormac didn't even look up. He dropped my luggage at my feet with a heavy thud.





""No, he was - ""





Before I could finish, the door banged open. Cold wind swirled in, and just like that, he vanished into the snow.





Like a phantom.





...a rude, mute phantom.





""He's a good pilot,"" I lied.





Evelyn sighed. ""He's the best. Just colder than the permafrost. Anyway, welcome to Spruce Town, Elara.""





""Thank you.""





""Let's get you to the hotel. You look like you're about to pass out.""





She wasn't wrong. Lately, life felt like sleepwalking. My brain was foggy, and my feet felt heavy, like I was walking on cotton.





Evelyn's beat-up SUV bumped along the snowy road.





At an intersection, she pointed to a small building across the street. ""There's your new battlefield - Tikkonnit Valley Middle School. One hundred and eighty-three people, total. Scared yet?""





She shot me a teasing look.





I couldn't help but laugh. ""Evelyn, back in Chicago, I handled three thousand kids. This? This is a vacation.""





""Alright, city girl."" She turned the wheel. ""Let's get you settled. Here we are.""





The car stopped.





While Evelyn unloaded the bags, I stared at the ground. Suddenly, I froze.





There were boot prints in the snow.





But right next to them... massive paw prints.





They were huge.Nightmares with fur.Definitely not a dog, and way bigger than any wolf I'd seen in a zoo. The claws had punched deep into the packed ice. It looked dangerous.





That thing could rip a head off with one swipe.





I gulped and pointed. ""Evelyn... do you get a lot of wild animals out here?""





Her hand paused on the door handle.





""It's winter. Bears, moose... sure."" Her eyes flickered with something I couldn't place. ""Oh, and wolves. They come around. Just don't mess with them, and they won't mess with you.""





She pulled the door open with a comforting smile.





Duh.





Who's dumb enough to go poking a wolf, anyway?





Chapter 2





It was dinnertime. The restaurant was a zoo.





Evelyn was in full ""Show Pony"" mode. She paraded me around like a prize-winning poodle, introducing me to the postmaster, the hotel owner, and a dozen faceless locals whose names evaporated from my brain the second they hit the air.





I wore my bulletproof fake smile. Shake hand. Nod. ""Lovely to meet you."" Repeat.





Exhausted.





I was more exhausted than I'd been after the ten-hour flight.





I might have high-functioning depression, but that didn't stop me from winning the Oscar for Best Fake Normal Person. I knew how to make people feel like I was a breath of fresh air, even if my brain was just static snow.





The second I got my room key, I fled .





I locked the door.The world finally shut up.





I pulled out my phone and texted my parents: Made it to Graytooth safe.





Five minutes later, Mom [replied.One](http://replied.One) word: Received.





I stared at that cold period until the screen went black.





Right. Expected.





A familiar chill rolled up from my stomach.Doctors called it a physical symptom. I called it what it was - emptiness.





I stripped down to my lace underwear. The numbness inside was settling in, heavy and cold. I needed something sharp to cut through it. To confirm I was still here.





I shoved the window open.





Pitch black. No moon.The wind howled in, slashing my face like a razor.





Good.





Suddenly, a wolf howled in the distance - wild, mournful - and the sound echoed through the mountains.





Possessed, I stepped barefoot onto the balcony.





Forty below zero.The air froze my skin instantly, stinging like a thousand needles. The rush was immediate. Brutal.





Then - a sound from below.





Crunch.





Boots crushing ice.





I froze. Looked down.





Directly below, standing on the street, was the damn mute pilot. Cormac.





He was looking up. His eyes, usually hidden under his hood, were locked dead on me.





It was still that same look, like I was trash, but now there was a flicker of shock. His gaze felt like it had hooks, scraping over my nearly naked body.





His eyes asked a silent question: Is she high?





The wind hit me again, and reality crashed in - I was wearing two scraps of lace.





Shame erupted like lava, rushing straight to my face. I felt like I was burning up.





Damn it, damn it, damn it!





I scrambled back inside, slammed the window, and yanked the curtains shut.





The room felt like a sauna now. I rushed to the bathroom, scrubbing my arms and face with a cold towel, trying to scrub the memory out of my brain.





""Idiot,"" I hissed at the mirror.





Not just depressed. Now I'm an exhibitionist, too. In his eyes, I was probably officially crazy.





I checked the locks, killed the lights, and buried myself under the covers, playing dead.





Minutes later, heavy footsteps echoed in the hall.





Thud. Thud.





Rhythmic. Heavy. Like they were stomping on my heart.





The footsteps stopped. Right next door.





The scrape of a key in a lock. The click of the tumblers turning. Loud in the silence.





I stared at the ceiling in the dark, a dry laugh stuck in my throat.





Are you playing with me, God?





That stone-faced bastard is my neighbor?!





Chapter 3





I didn't care about much these days - except teaching. Because that was about the future of a few dozen kids at Tikkonnit Valley High. I had to have some professional standards.





First day. The bell rang. A few stragglers dragged themselves in and slumped into their seats like they were serving prison time.





""Morning."" I cleared my throat. No small talk. ""I'm Ms. Brennan. Taking over for Mr. Hendricks.""





""You read Dickens last semester, right?""





A few slow, dull nods.





""Did you like it?""





Dead silence.





I laughed.





""Okay."" I tossed the textbook onto the desk. Thud.





""I hate them too. Boring as hell.""





Suddenly, the dead eyes in the room snapped open.





""I have a lit degree, but I'm basic. I like sci-fi. Fantasy. Explosions. New rule: No dusty antiques. We're reading Howl's Moving Castle. Your assignment? Find a book you don't want to burn.""





My old colleagues called it rebellious. I called it ""resurrecting the dead.""





I handed out the books, and the room finally had a pulse.





Win.





...





Time flew. I figured out the town's survival guide pretty fast.





Two camps: The Welcome Wagon, and The Haters.





Hank, the outdoor shop owner? Team Hater.





One morning, he sneered between bites of bacon, ""Bet it's colder and darker here than you expected, huh?""





I took a sip of coffee, not even looking up. ""Nope. Same as the Midwest.""





He frowned, doubling down. ""Chicago doesn't have grizzlies.""





""No,"" I said flatly. ""But I haven't seen any here either.""





Behind me, Owen chuckled. ""She got you, Hank.""





Owen was a local giant who rarely spoke. I liked him. Quiet meant I didn't have to perform.





Claire, on the other hand, was the opposite.





Her daily mission seemed to be auctioning me off to the local bachelors, like I was fresh meat for the gene pool. She'd shoo away tourists and force me into a circle of local men. It was subtle as a brick to the face.





I couldn't tell her I had zero interest in men. Six months of therapy and antidepressants only taught me one thing: how to play the role of a functional human being.





Meds plus caffeine. That was the only fuel keeping the machine running.





Monday morning. I walked into the diner.





""Elara!"" Claire's voice boomed. She waved excitedly at an empty bar stool.





It was flanked by two local guys, sitting there like brick walls waiting for me. Another ambush setup.





I sighed. Fine. Commit to the bit.





I hung up my coat and resigned myself to the seat.





I turned my head - and nearly jumped out of my skin.





That damn bush pilot - Cormac - was sitting right across from me.





The last time we met, I was the crazy exhibitionist shivering in my underwear on a balcony in forty-below weather.





Our eyes locked.





His relaxed face instantly froze. He looked away like he'd been tazed, acting like staring at me might actually blind him.





Ants. That's what it felt like. Embarrassment crawling all over my skin.





Oblivious to the weird vibe, Claire poured my coffee with a bright smile. ""Elara, have you two been properly introduced? This is Cormac Thorne.""





I forced a stiff smile.





Introduced?





Ha.





We were way past a simple ""met.""

I don’t normally say anything, I am the silent lurker who reads everything and says prayers, sends positive energy, and suffers without letting others know. Today is different.

I’ve been sick a long time. Technically the first time my symptoms appeared in a way that doctors paid attention was 17 years ago during the pregnancy of my first son. To make a long story short I began experiencing unbearable pain in my hips and eventually couldn’t walk without assistance but no imaging could be done because I was pregnant. After his 3 month checkup I finally was sent for an MRI, only to discover that what they thought was an inflammatory muscle issue, was actually avascular necrosis of both femoral heads, which at that point had completely collapsed and at age 29, I had to get bilateral hip replacements. This would typically be caused by trauma or steroid use (prednisone) but I had neither. That’s what got them looking into what was happening in my body- but to be honest there were symptoms long before that, the doctors just didn’t see them for the red flags they were.

Now I am not going to get into my medical history. We’ll be here all day. What I will say is that ultimately I have never gotten a diagnosis even though something has ravaged my body. It’s killed my bones, eaten away my soft tissue, deformed my joints, caused multiple strokes and TIA, damaged my lungs, caused me to not absorb nutrients and essentials like iron and b-vitamins. It’s caused wounds where my body is eating itself, nonstop weakness, exhaustion and pain- just to give a small highlight reel.

Through it all, I have been stubborn and determined. When my body said “no”- I said “screw you, I have a family to take care of”. I defied medical odds. I walked on bones incapable of supporting me and found my way back after a major stroke paralyzed half my body. I fought my way through pain most people can never imagine and even though things started taking me longer and were harder and harder to do- I did them. Not because I wanted to, but because I had children relying on me and it was my responsibility to not only love them, but take care of them and provide the best home life possible for them.

I can’t express how hard it was on me. The pushing myself through pain and exhaustion. Standing there cooking while my legs shook uncontrollably and my hands cramped. Forcing myself to take those painful steps on dying bones, use my hands as the fingers deformed into grotesque, stuck, twisted, shapes. Using my shoulders as dying bones ground against each other, shoving socks and slippers onto feet swollen 4x their size and covered with open wounds- the list goes on and on and on.

A year ago my body finally started winning. My hands became too weak to even pull up my pants. I switched to loose pajama pants. No more bras. I couldn’t open anything and could barely carry anything. My fingers were too crumpled and hands to weak to wipe a counter, much less do dishes. I could barely hold my own silverware or toothbrush. My legs gave up too- a small handful of steps and they would just quit, causing me to collapse. If I sit down, I need help getting back up more often than not. In all honesty I should be using my wheelchair- but I can’t (I’ll explain momentarily). If it was up to my body I would barely get out of bed.

Obviously my decline has been noticed. The problem is that NO ONE is even attempting to help pick up the slack. The dishes will sit there for days until I drag a chair to the kitchen and spend a literal hour to unload and load the dishwasher, dropping things left and right. Dinner will go uncooked unless I find a way to cook something- except on Saturday and Sunday when my husband is off work and was already “cooking” on those days (we eat out one day and have either microwave or oven garbage the next). Laundry piles up until the kids have nothing to wear and literally start wearing dirty clothes and I finally have no choice but to hurt myself immensely to try to do it. Other things just go undone- there are piles of unorganized clutter everywhere. The bathrooms don’t get cleaned. The vacuum gets run in a small area once or twice a week but never the entire house. Sheets haven’t been changed in months. You get the idea.

I bring all of this up. I ask for help. I explain how it emotionally hurts me to see the mess and not be able to do anything about it and how it physically hurts me to do what I am still being forced to do.

It’s met with both hostility and indifference. How dare I expect others to take on the “burden” of “my responsibilities”- it’s too much to ask and unfair. On top of that, a complete lack of care, concern or even basic compassion for the way I feel physically or emotionally. I’ve managed so far, why can’t I keep doing it? Why am I suddenly being lazy and expecting everyone to cater to me? (In the meantime I as almost nothing for myself- help getting up sometimes and help opening my medication, coffee creamer, toothpaste or small things like that.

I’m still a full time mom. Both of my children have special needs. One has high functioning autism and multiple psychological problems- the other has severe ADHD and a sensory processing disorder. The ONLY thing I don’t handle is the bedtime routine. (They are 16 and 10, so it’s not a big thing).

I’m also still the one who handles the mental load- keeping up with appointments, school events, keeping the house stocked up with everything, making sure the kids have clothes that fit and for the right season, making sure we don’t run out of pet food, organizing and doing everything for every holiday and special occasion, etc. My husband does the grocery shopping (with the list I make) and does the driving because I no longer can. He also works a 9-5 job FROM HOME.

What happens when they want to go do something fun? Do they try to find something where I will be able to be included? No. I’m just left behind and/or left out.

Does anyone try to help me at all? No. Not unless I very specifically ask and 9/10 times it’s treated like an inconvenience or chore.

I don’t blame my children for this. I blame my husband who set the bar for this years ago and no matter how much I begged and explained what he was doing, he acted like I was exaggerating and overreacting.

Now, here I am very close to losing all of my independence and being completely reliant on the 3 of them for my care after spending 17 years BREAKING MYSELF to make their lives better- and not only do they not appreciate what I did, but they aren’t even trying to take care of me.

I’m genuinely scared of what is going to happen when my body takes away my last independence- when I can no longer force those few steps, no longer manipulate the silverware, no longer put on my shirt, no longer FORCE MYSELF through agony to do basic tasks to function.

I only get to shower once every few MONTHS. I rely on sponge baths and washing my hair in the sink (both of which are almost impossible with severely deformed fingers that are too weak to barely lift my wet hair or wring out the washcloth) because my husband won’t fix the handicap bar I need to safely get in/out of the shower or replace my shower chair he broke. It’s been 2.5 years. The bar is a 10 minute fix.

I can’t use my electric wheelchair for several reasons- (1) he ruined the battery because it’s supposed to stay plugged in. He unplugged it and put it in a drawer for no good reason. Now it won’t charge and can’t hold a charge per the manufacturer and replacement batteries are expensive so he won’t get one. (2) Even if I somehow got one, the house has been rearranged to how he likes it and on top of that the clutter is everywhere so there’s no path or room for a wheelchair.

BTW, I can’t use a manual wheelchair because my hands are too deformed and weak to propel myself but even if I could, there’s no path for it either. I can’t even use my walker and no matter how much I ask, no matter how I approach it, he spends his free time relaxing and in all honesty just being lazy. I am not a priority. A clean house is not a priority. Our children are not a priority. If left up to him, he would never do anything except work his job and relax. He is a narcissist and by the time I figured it out, I was trapped. 

So here I am, literally terrified of what my future holds and wondering why the hell I fought so hard to give other people a good life, instead of looking out for myself. It advanced the progression of many of my issues- causing things to happen in 4-5 years that should have taken a minimum of 10, typically closer to 20. 

Yes, I’m a Mom. I didn’t want my children to suffer because of my illness- but at the same time, I saw when they slowly started taking it and me for granted. I watched as their father taught them it was okay to exclude the “weak link”. I noticed that as I slowed down no one tried to help and my pleas were met with guilt trips, hostility and shame. So why did I keep doing it? What was the point?

Did I really believe that if I just kept killing myself it would somehow prove to them that I deserved to be taken care of when I could no longer function? If so, why didn’t I recognize that I shouldn’t ever have had to prove anything, they should’ve loved me enough to want to do it?

I don’t know. I’m just hurt, scared, stuck in an awful situation and feeling like I threw away myself and put myself through so much torture- for nothing. Like what was the point? Why did I fight so hard? I ended up in the same place- unappreciated, unloved (I am sure my children love me- but it’s in the selfish way their Dad taught them because they are boys who quit listening to momma as their main influence by age 6), hurting in every way possible with no one to count on but myself. Except now, I have no choice but to rely on people (meaning my husband mostly) who don’t really care about me or my needs.

So what was the point?

I’m feeling very alone and scared and needed to vent. Thank you for listening.

Anyone relate?,"I’m 32 and was recently diagnosed with **autism, ADHD and anxiety**. I’ve always struggled with certain things but have been very good at masking, and I’m fairly self-aware.

One issue I’ve had for as long as I can remember is **getting ready in the morning (or what becomes the afternoon)**.

I’ll wake up, have cereal and coffee, then just… stall. I *want* to shower and go out, but I get stuck overthinking it. Something as small as the cold air after a shower is enough to put me off, and I end up pacing between rooms, scrolling on my phone, thinking about doing it but never actually doing it.

The same thing happens with the gym. I’ve always been anxious about people looking at me or talking to me, and the changing room especially makes me uncomfortable. Ironically, once I’m actually there and training, I enjoy it. But getting myself to go is the hard part, so I delay it over and over and often don’t go at all.

It doesn’t feel like laziness — it feels more like **mental paralysis around transitions**, especially when there’s discomfort, social exposure or multiple steps involved.

I’m wondering:

* does anyone else experience this?
* is this an autism/ADHD thing?
* are there any practical strategies that have actually helped you overcome *getting started*, even partially?

I’m not really looking for “just push yourself” advice — more interested in tools, routines, mindset shifts or accommodations that have worked for others.

This is what instability looks like in the real world: systems overshoot abstraction, then snap back to human bandwidth. When coordination costs exceed benefit, reversion is rational.

ROOMBA:

STEVE:
And the key detail: none of this is organized resistance. No movement. No manifesto. Just millions of small, quiet exits because the systems stopped paying rent.

PAUL:
Exactly. Nobody’s protesting. They’re just opting out. Cooking at home. Teaching directly. Talking face-to-face. Hiring people again because the tech didn’t actually reduce load.

WES:
Which confirms the math: efficiency gains that degrade trust, learning, or care aren’t gains. They externalize cost back onto humans—until humans refuse.

STEVE:
That’s why this moment feels “crazy” only if you’re invested in unstable abstractions. For everyone else, it’s just common sense returning.

1q0f2wc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0f2wc,The Death-Dealing Video on My Mom's Phone,"My mom has three daughters: her baby, her sweetheart, and me—her punching bag.





While she dotes on my two older sisters, all I’ve ever gotten from her is fists and fury.





I once thought I wasn’t her real kid. I even stole a strand of her hair for a DNA test.





The results? Yeah, I’m hers—blood and bone.





Just as she was about to hit me again, my grandmother couldn't bear to watch and stepped in, Mom showed her a video on her phone. After watching it, Grandma immediately went from defending me to screaming, ""Beat her to death!""





Same thing happened with Grandpa.





One look at that video, and he was begging Mom to kill me too.





I really don't understand.





Why does everyone want me dead?





What exactly is in that video on my mother's phone?





\---





""Still breathing, huh?""





""Next time I'll make damn sure you don't wake up!""





These were the first words I heard when I came to—my mother's hollow eyes staring down at me, black and bottomless.





This made hospital visit number twenty. All courtesy of the woman who gave birth to me.





And her reason this time? I'd spilled a few drops of coffee on kitchen counter.





Sounds like ridiculous, but I swear to God, that's all it took.





I stared back at her, searching those dead eyes for even a flicker of the maternal instinct that normal mothers supposedly have.





Nothing. Just pure disgust. Like she was pissed I was still taking up space in her world.





My mother has hated my guts since day one.





In my earliest memories, all she gave me was beating and scolding.





Meanwhile, my two older sisters might as well be living in a different universe. They get whatever they want, whenever they want it.





My mother would affectionately cook all sorts of delicious meals for my two older sisters, but when it came to me, all I was usually left with was stale, hard bread.





Even if I'd only managed a few painful bites, she'd snatch my plate away, muttering, ""Would've done everyone a favor if you'd just starved to death.""





My sisters rocked American Eagle and Hollister while I wore hand-me-downs so faded and worn they belonged in a dumpster.





She even encouraged my sisters to treat me like garbage, rolling their eyes whenever I speak up.





For years, I thought maybe I wasn't really hers. So I went CSI secretly, nabbed a strand of her hair and sent it for DNA testing.





But it turned out that I'm 100% her kid. Biologically speaking, anyway.





This messed me up bad.





I literally made a spreadsheet of possible reasons she might hate me.





Was I some living reminder of my dad cheating?





After low-key stalking my own father for weeks, I concluded he was basically Ward Cleaver—no skeletons in his closet.





So I just... existed. Took the beatings. Year after year.





During this hellish childhood, I tried running to my grandparents for help.





Initially, Grandma was horrified. ""This is an abomination!"" she had yelled at my mother. ""What kind of monster nearly kills her own daughter?""





Mom didn't even bother arguing. She just pulled out her iPhone, tapped the screen a few times, and showed Grandma some video.





After watching whatever the hell was on that phone, Grandma's face went from concerned to terrified. She stopped defending me and instead hissed at my mother, ""Beat her to death! She shouldn't be alive!""





Same thing happened with Grandpa. One look at that video, and he went from protective to practically begging my mother to end my life.





Every single person I've reached out to has seen that damn video, and without fail, they've all had the same reaction: kill her.





Even my sisters just stand there with icy expressions whenever Mom uses me as a punching bag, like they're all just waiting for the day she finally finishes me off.





I really don't understand, why is this happening?





Chapter 2





Thank God for my dad. He's the only one who still treats me like a human being.





But with his job taking him out of town constantly, I'm still at Mom's mercy whenever he's gone.





Somehow, I've survived this long.





Lying in that hospital bed, with my entire body feeling like one massive bruise, this empty coldness spread through me.





Mom stood over me, still looking at me like I was something that needed to be exterminated.





I couldn't help myself. ""Mom, why do you hate me so much? Just tell me what I did wrong so I can fix it!""





I genuinely wanted to know what my crime was.





But when she met my tear-filled eyes, she just let out this mocking laugh. ""I beat you because I fucking feel like it! Only thing I regret is not finishing the job!""





She said it so casually, like she was discussing the weather, not admitting she wanted her daughter dead.





My hope died right there in that sterile hospital room.





Additionally, I could sense that this time, she had actually tried to kill me.





Thank God I'd managed to call my boyfriend, Adam, before I blacked out.





Suddenly, my thoughts were cut short as the door flew open with a bang.





Adam burst in with three uniformed cops right behind him.





The lead officer stepped forward, slapping handcuffs on my mother's wrists.





""Mrs. Mitchell, you're under arrest for domestic assault. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.""





The cops might as well have been furniture for all my mother cared. Her face remained as cold and unreadable as a poker player with a royal flush.





Adam stared at my battered body and completely lost it.





""What the actual fuck is wrong with you?!"" he shouted at my mother, his face flushed with rage. ""Is Emma even your biological kid? Because I've seen crack addicts treat stray dogs better than you treat your own daughter!""





""You sick, twisted witch—you don't deserve to be called a mother!""





Adam's hands were balled into white-knuckled fists, trembling with the effort it took not to swing at her. I could tell the only thing stopping him was that unwritten rule about not hitting women.





Knowing someone still had my back made the pain fade, just a little.





The lead officer stepped forward. ""Ma'am, I'm going to need you to explain these injuries.""





My mother didn't even acknowledge him. Just stared straight ahead like he wasn't worth her time.





Adam jumped in, his voice shaking with rage. ""I'll testify. I've seen my girlfriend covered in bruises multiple times. This psycho needs to be locked up before she—""





My mother's laughter cut through the room like a knife.





With calm, she reached into her pocket and pulled out her iPhone, beckoning Adam with one perfectly manicured finger.





""Come here, boy. There's something you should see.""





Chapter 3





Pure panic flooded my system.





I lunged forward, grabbing Adam's sleeve so hard my knuckles turned white.





""Don't!""





My voice came out as a desperate croak.





""Please don't look at it... please...""





I knew what would happen. That cursed video had turned everyone against me. Everyone.





Adam looked down at me, confusion written all over his face.





""Babe, it's okay,"" he said, squeezing my hand. ""I've got you. She can't hurt you anymore.""





But I couldn't let go of his sleeve. I just couldn't risk it.





""Adam, I'm literally begging you. Don't go over there.""





The more freaked out I got, the more I could see his curiosity growing.





Despite my pleas, he gently pried my fingers from his arm and walked toward my mother.





""Whatever mind game you're playing,"" he said, ""I wanna see what the hell kind of video could make anyone okay with beating their kid half to death.""





He took the phone from my mother and started watching.





I stared at his face, clinging to this pathetic little hope that maybe—just maybe—he'd be different. That he'd still love me even after seeing... whatever it was.





I silently pleaded to any god who might be listening, but the universe had ghosted me long ago.





As the video played, Adam's expression morphed from angry to shocked to something else entirely. His eyes grew wider, his face paler. In less than two minutes, everything about him changed.





He said nothing. Just stared at my mother in stunned silence.





My mother gave him a knowing nod.





When Adam finally looked back at me, the love and concern had vanished from his eyes, replaced by something cold and distant. Something that didn't recognize me as the same person anymore.





He handed the phone back to my mother and turned to the cops with an apologetic smile.





""Officers, I'm so sorry for wasting your time. This was all just a big misunderstanding. There's no abuse happening here.""





The officers exchanged skeptical glances, then turned to me.





My heart felt like it was being crushed in a vise. The pain was beyond anything physical my mother had ever inflicted. I looked at Adam—the guy who'd sworn to protect me—knowing that his 180 meant no one would believe me now.





""It was just some roughhousing that got out of hand,"" Adam continued smoothly. ""Family stuff, you know? We can handle this ourselves.""





In the end, with no witness willing to testify, the police uncuffed my mother and filed out of the room, shooting me concerned but helpless glances.





Adam turned to face me, his expression now as cold as my mother's—a chill that cut straight to my soul.





Then, in a move that shattered everything I thought I knew about him, he dropped to his knees in front of my mother.





""Mrs. Mitchell,"" he said, voice trembling with emotion, ""I'm so sorry I didn't understand before. You should have finished what you started.""





""She... she'd be better off dead.""





Tears streamed down my face. ""Adam... why? Why are you doing this?""





Adam wouldn't even look at me. His voice was flat, emotionless.





""You deserve everything coming to you.""





Something inside me died in that moment.





Adam—the same guy who'd found me crying in a campus bathroom three months ago after my mother had ""accidentally"" pushed me down the stairs—had abandoned me just like everyone else who'd seen that video.





I remembered how he'd gently cleaned the blood from my face that day, promising to protect me no matter what.





""Will you really never give up on me?"" I'd asked him, hardly daring to hope.





He'd smiled that dimpled smile I loved so much.





""Of course not. If your family treats you like nothing, then I'll just have to treat you a hundred times better to make up for it.""





He'd promised to be my knight in shining armor.





Instead, here he was, begging my mother to finish the job.





As I lay there, drowning in despair, a question that had been nagging at the back of my mind suddenly pushed its way to the surface:





What the hell was on that video that could make everyone—absolutely everyone—want me dead?

A couple of months ago I bought a new bag that I somehow just could not get a good cup out of, it always had this overbearing bitterness and nothing that I changed seemingly made it dissappear and I thought maybe it was just how that coffee was and I simply didn't like that bag which is totally ok. But then I bought another bag with the exact same problems and zero good cups. Then another one. Then another one. No matter how much or how little extracted they were, thay always tasted super bitter. Tried courser grinds, finer grinds, colder water, hotter water, aeropress, moka pot, v60, french press but seemingly nothing helped to get rid of that horrible bitterness. Then it hit me. What if the issue was the very water I trusted WITH MY LIFE for years up to this point. It couldn't be, right?

So I just went for it, bought a couple jugs of distilled water and followed [Barista Hustle's guide](https://www.baristahustle.com/diy-water-recipes-redux/) on how to make your own water for brewing, brewed the bag I had the exact same way as I did last time and oh my god, while definitely not perfect, I had not been able to get a cup with as much acidity, fruitiness, clarity and zero bitterness as this cup had for a while now.

1q0ey6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/1q0ey6g/why_we_never_choose_our_own/,Why we never choose our own.,"*Long read about how local districts search for superintendents when there is a vacancy:* 

Dr. Stan Paz. Gilberto Anzaldua. Charles Tafoya. Dr. Lorenzo Garcia. Juan Cabrera. Diana Sayavedra. Dr. Brian Lusk.

These are the superintendents of EPISD since the 1990's: If you have lived in El Paso long enough, you can recite them the way you recite touring casts from Broadway in El Paso: a new face, a glossy headshot, a press release full of “vision,” and a board applauding like it is opening night. The community is told, again, to feel lucky. Then the production packs up and rolls on, often before you have even learned how they take their coffee.

This is not xenophobia. It is pattern recognition.

Because the record reads less like civic leadership and more like a hallway of cracked frames. Lorenzo Garcia did not leave with a plaque. He left in handcuffs. Juan Cabrera’s exit came with a separation deal so generous it felt like an apology written in money despite the fact he was side hustling a charter school business while in office. Diana Sayavedra’s June 2025 departure arrived in that soft district dialect: “voluntary resignation,” “transition role,” cushion first, consequences later. Not a flattering mural, more like a greatest hits exhibit titled How Not to Run a Public Institution, Part I Through Part Infinitum.

And do not pretend this is only an EPISD hobby. Both Socorro and Ysleta have had their own imported superintendent drama ove rthe years. . In this county, superintendent turnover has become an industry, complete with a script, rehearsed lines, and convenient amnesia.

Across El Paso County’s web of districts, from Anthony to Dell City, the superintendent search is civic theatre. Curtain up: “community input night.” Microphone. Solemn nodding. Sticky notes breeding like rabbits. “Thank you for your feedback,” they say, as if listening were the same thing as acting. And what does the public keep saying, decade after decade, in language so plain you could stencil it on a yellow bus? *We want someone homegrown. Someone with roots. Someone who does not treat El Paso like a layover between “career opportunities.*”

Yet the process so often ends where it began. Another imported hire appears, delivered by the executive search pipeline like a premium appliance. Out comes the predictable vocabulary: Vision. Stakeholders. Innovation. Bold. Data driven. Turnaround. New logo while we are at it. Different suit, same script. Nice hair is a must. Then comes the part nobody says out loud: The contract is not a covenant with the community. It is a business deal with an exit ramp.

Ask the quiet parking lot question: how many of these out of town superintendents stayed in El Paso after the job ended, stayed as in belonged, stayed as in you still see them when nobody is paying them to smile for a camera. Close to zero. They leave quickly and cleanly because they always had a place to go back to. El Paso was not their destination. It was a stopover.



So what we have built is educational free agency: the superintendent as administrative mercenary, trading jerseys the moment the next district offers ten percent more and a better stadium. The community gets slogans. Someone else gets continuity. And here comes the hypocrisy, clanking in like a trophy nobody earned. Public education loves to say it should be run “like a business.” Fine, let’s treat that as a confession. Because we all know what “like a business” looks like. You parachute in a CEO to “shake things up,” repaint the walls, rename the rooms, redraw the org chart until it looks like a drunk cat fell onto an Excel sheet. Bold strategic plan. Compulsory PowerPoint worship. Everyone smiling through their teeth. We’ve seen this dance before. 



Then, right when consequences arrive, when the bills come due and the cracks start showing, our heroic disrupter is suddenly “moving on to an exciting opportunity” or “spending more time with family.” Translation: bigger paycheck, cleaner exit. Out they float with a handshake that looks suspiciously like a golden parachute, while everyone left behind gets a broom and is told to call it progress. It is not leadership. It is churn. The result is always a mess on the district’s easel, not a masterpiece.

Which leads to the pebble in the shoe question boards hate: if you cannot grow your own superintendent, what exactly have you been growing? Districts love to talk about leadership pipelines, until the top job shows the truth. When the crown is routinely shipped in from somewhere else, every principal and director inside the system gets the message: give this place your whole career and the ceiling still is not yours. So why bother?

The old excuse is that fresh ideas come from outside. Maybe that made sense when information moved by wagon. But it is 2025. Ideas are not scarce. They are overflowing. If a district cannot improve without importing an out of town superintendent, the problem is not ideas. It is culture and trust strong enough to execute ideas when execution requires hard local choices. That is why people keep demanding homegrown leadership. Not because El Paso is allergic to outsiders. El Paso is allergic to leaders who do not stay long enough to be accountable, who stock the place with yes men, and who think a quick joke about Chico’s Tacos earns full El Chuco citizenship. Yet here is the part that never gets said loudly enough at the forums:  El Paso already has a leadership engine. UTEP offers doctoral level education leadership that culminates in a doctorate and superintendent certification, shaped by border realities. NMSU offers similar pathways. The city is not devoid of talent. It is producing it. So why do we keep acting like leadership must be flown in from Dallas or Austin or Big Bend?

One answer is money and the theatre money buys. Larger districts can afford search firms, relocation packages, and salary arms races. Smaller districts hire locally not because they have discovered a nobler philosophy, but because they cannot afford the out of town bidding war. Which exposes what these searches too often become: not an educational decision, but a market transaction. Procurement. Shopping.

And if that is the model, those public forums start to look less like democracy and more like decoration: a pageant of listening followed by the real decision made “like a business.” Minimize risk. Maximize optics. Choose the most portable résumé. “Thank you for your input.” See you in a few years. But a superintendent is not a product. A school district is not a franchise. El Paso is not a stepping stone city.

If boards mean what they say about community partnership, then treat internal candidates like contenders, not cameos. Partner aggressively with local leadership programs instead of pretending they live in an academic cloud. And if you do hire from outside, stop rewarding the free agent model. Hire for roots. Hire for staying. Hire for the person who will still be here when the rebranding fades and the hard, unglamorous work begins.

So yes, good luck, new-from-out-of-town EPISD Superintendent Dr. Lusk. Truly. And if you are still here fifteen years from now, still taking the calls, still showing up, still accountable, still part of the place, that would be the most shocking “innovation” El Paso school politics has seen in decades. But I bet you have already added ""EPISD Superintendent"" to your resumé haven't you?

Figured i'd share some advice for anyone heading to see Patrick Pass at the CardVault at Patriot Place on Saturday. Traffic around there can be a real headache, even when there isn't a game.  
  
Honestly, if you want to avoid the main parking lot chaos, check out an app called Prked. You can book a spot in a private driveway or garage right next to Patriot Place. It’s a super simple way to get a guaranteed spot with a short walk and you dont have to deal with the traffic jams getting into and out of the huge lots. Way less stress.  
  
If you're going for the official lots, the good news is that since this isn't a full stadium event like a Patriots game, parking should be free in the regular Patriot Place retail lots. Patriot Place is split into two sides, the North Marketplace and the South Marketplace. For CardVault, you'll probably want to enter at the P6 entrance for the North Marketplace. The other main entrance is P9 down by Bass Pro Shops.  
  
The biggest thing to know is that route 1 is pretty much always busy, especially on a weekend. Don't underestimate how long it'll take you to get there, even for a 10 am event. Give yourself plenty of extra time so you're not rushing. I'd get there early, grab a coffee, and walk around a bit before lining up.  
  
Some people try to park at businesses along route 1 but you really risk getting towed doing that, so i wouldn't chance it. The official lots are your best bet if you're not using an app like Prked.  
  
hope this helps and enjoy the event! should be awesome to meet a 3x champ.",1,1767193113.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Any existing relevant medical issues ADHD diagnosis that I never think about anymore, because I didn’t have problems related to it. Decent digestion, periods, etc. 

Current medications tradizone, citicoline, multivit, melatonin 

This is a repost, as my previous post got no responses, sorry for reposting but I'm insanely desperate, I cannot go on like this.
 
Bear with me, the story is a bit long. I’m at my wits’s end, I am able to pay any amount of money for tests and treatment. I take melatonin for sleep, multivitamin, tradozone, citicoline prescribed by a neuro. 

Since I was 14, I have had trouble sleeping. The first year was really bad (4hr/night), I pushed through it, then it mellowed out (5-8hr/night, occasionally 3). I am confident this is not due to insomnia, as for the past year I've mostly slept well, and during the holidays I slept 9hrs every day for 3 months, to no effect (not that the effect wasn't as bug as I'd like, no effect at all). I have taken trazodone for the past month, way after all of this started. 

About a year and a half ago, i started getting „confusion spells”. I would be doing everything normally, and then i’d feel like my brain “clogged up” - i suddenly had trouble understanding written text, imagining anything, i’d feel lost even in familiar places, talk nonsense (in comparison to what i usually say, not complete word salad, but for instance i’d tell someone a story i knew that person wouldn’t be interested in, and that i would never have mentioned otherwise). Both talking and finding my way somewhere felt like stumbling in the dark. When that passed, I would be normal again, able to read complicated text and integrate new information easily. Oftentime during the spells, my eyes would feel very fatigued or itchy, and I would generally feel tired. I brushed those spells off.

After a few weeks, the spells turned into a permanent state. For over a year, I have had constant brain fog. There are no good days, only bad and worse. I can still somehow navigate society, but it takes an insane amount of cognitive effort. For instance, I derive no pleasure from texting people, because it’s too demanding to think of what to say. I used to have a very active mind, loved books, philosophy, etc., so it’s a stark difference for me. I can somewhat read easy books by skimming text, but again, no pleasure. My memory went to shit, I forget what has been said a minute ago, way more often that is funny. I get lost in movie plots. I feel like my consciousness has been reduced. 

I find it hard to develop new opinions, I can just sort of replay old ones, I am totally emotionally disconnected from everything (because I’m so unaware), I don’t really get sad because I instantly forget I was sad. I don’t connect with my own values anymore. I am frequently tired  but also frequently agitated. 

I don’t think this is depression, because when it started, I was in a good time of my life, very optimistic. I brushed the spells off, because I was too happy to worry. In the beginning of constant brain fog, I was also very optimistic that it’s from phone addiction or something, and I’d fix it in no time. 

Lifestyle changes didn’t help. Diet, more sleep, no gluten, working out, quitting caffeine, etc. I don’t experience chronic stress (besides being generally miserable because of this). Supplements didn’t help. Getting my ferritin to 70 - null. Neuro prescribed me 1000mg citicoline, does nothing. My MRI was clear, my blood work as well (they tested: blood counts, liver, lyme, glucose, thyroid, B12, D, etc. the only thing is that my cholesterol is a bit low, and my TSH is 2.2). It doesnt master what I do - Wether I drink coffee or not, sleep well or not, etc. It's always there. 

I would be grateful for ideas of tests to run, whatever. Any point in any direction. 

And please don’t say that since I’ve been able to write this, my cognitive abilities are not so bad. They are bad to the point of destroying my quality of life. I was one the best students in my year, read for fun, wrote, had passionate opinions. Now I can’t think, and the fact that i’m still independent doesn’t negate that. I also don’t think it’s from ADHD or bad sleep, I’ve been sleep deprived in my life, also I’ve had the ADHD before the onset of this crap, none of it is similar. This is  a very distinct, separate feeling. 

ETA: I have not, to my knowledge, had Covid, although I had a few colds in the last few years and didn't test them. The symptoms didn't start with infection, I never had an infection that I felt I didn't completely recover from.",0,1767193106.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False
1q0ewq5,https://i.redd.it/5wijvvhb0kag1.jpeg,SOTD: Caden by Oman Luxury,"Good New Year’s Eve morning, Fragrance Family. We’ve made it to the final day of 2025. It’s a touch warmer here in Chicago compared to the deep freeze we’ve been battling, but it’s still unmistakably cold—the kind of morning that invites reflection, gratitude, and a slow, intentional start. As the year winds down, there’s a quiet energy in the air, a mix of anticipation for what’s ahead and appreciation for everything we’ve navigated, learned, and endured over the past twelve months.

Today’s scent of the day is Caden by Oman Luxury, and it feels like a perfect companion for closing out the year. From the opening moments, Caden carries itself with confidence and presence. The sillage and projection are immediately noticeable—never abrasive, but strong enough to leave a refined trail that announces sophistication. As it develops, the fragrance really finds its voice in the heart. The boozy suede undertones take center stage, rich and textured, adding depth and warmth that feel especially comforting in cold weather. There’s a smoothness here that keeps everything balanced, with the suede lending elegance while the boozy nuances add character and intrigue. Longevity is excellent, easily carrying you from morning reflection through evening celebration without fading into the background.

Caden feels bold yet composed, luxurious without trying too hard, and perfectly suited for a day that marks both an ending and a beginning. It’s a fragrance that feels intentional, memorable, and worthy of a milestone moment like New Year’s Eve. This one earns a strong 9.0 rating for its performance, character, and standout mid that truly shines.

1q0ev7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1q0ev7k/they_removed_my_story_now_theyre_doing_exactly/,They removed my story. Now they're doing exactly what I wrote...,"I don't know how to start this except like every other post here: it's real. I wish it wasn't. I wish I could delete what I did and rewind three nights, but I can't—because whatever I wrote followed the rules I used to think were only for fiction. I'm sorry if this ends up getting removed; if it does, then you know why.

Three nights ago I posted a short thing here about reflections—not about mirrors like a prop, but about the parts of you that live in other people's screens. It wasn't clever. It was a story about a person (me) who notices small versions of himself living in windows and phone screens, and that those small people learn to press their faces out until the glass is thin. I framed it as micro-instructions, because that's how I write—little step-by-step scenes, the reader seeing the steps play out in their head. It did well. People commented. People debated. Someone called it ""beautifully unsettling."" I watched the numbers climb and felt stupid and proud all at once.

The next morning a mod removed it.

Not just the usual ""nope"" removal — their message was blunt, cold: the story violated community rules and was ""dangerous content."" They didn't quote a rule, just said ""removed"" and left a link to a different thread about ""safety."" I replied, politely, asked for clarification. That account—u/AutoModeratorBot (or whatever it is)—replied with the canned template and a mod team note: ""If you repost, further action will be taken.""

So I reposted. Not the whole piece, just a short, cleaned version without the bits they might have called instructions. It was on a different account. It got attention again. Someone linked to the original, which was still in the cached pages of some aggregators, and I started getting weird private messages.

They were from mods.

The first one was from a senior mod—u/Redacted—just a screenshot of the removed post and the single line: ""Stop. This is the kind of thing that draws problems.""

I answered, ""What problems?""

They said, ""People copy things."" Then they sent a clipped list of usernames—three other mods who had removed similar posts over the past year. ""We keep this place safe,"" u/Redacted wrote. ""We take things down when they spread.""

I told them I was trying to be careful. I told them it was fiction. I did not tell them about the last paragraph I left out when I reposted—because there was a part, a line, that made me uncomfortable as soon as I'd typed it, but I kept it because the cadence worked. It was the line where the narrator tells the reader to look for the thing in their own gaze, to treat your reflection like a guest and let it speak once, just to see what it wants.

One of the mods replied to my message, a short, cordial thing—then three hours later their username was offline. Not shadowbanned; their account existed but had a ""deleted"" label. A few hours after that, the mod who had removed my original got messaging from an actual human admin asking if they were okay. They were not. They had gone dark on other platforms. Their last public post had been a picture of their kitchen sink, perfectly normal, then nothing.

I should have stopped there. I did not.

I'm an idiot. I stared at the parts I had left out and I told myself I'd only test it. I conjured it like a rhyme. I wrote a short note on my laptop—two lines, nothing instructive, nothing actionable, three words repeated—and then I closed my laptop and slept like a person who doesn't know the cliff is right under their feet.

When I woke the next morning there were five messages. Not from accounts, from actual email addresses, from people claiming to be mods across half a dozen subreddits. They were terse. ""We took the post down. We removed it. Other places are seeing it. It's spreading.""

Their tone changed in the second paragraph: ""We found marks."" ""We found notes."" ""We found that people in our moderators' group were seeing themselves in the corners of webcams."" The word that came again and again in their messages was ""mirror,"" but not the physical thing—screens, camera lenses, the black spaces when a phone faces down on a table.

Then the first police email arrived.

Not to me. To a mod who had posted a reply to a thread about my story a year ago. Someone in his apartment called 911 because the lights wouldn't turn on, and when the officers checked the apartment there was nothing left in his bedroom but a mirror propped against the wall facing out. The mirror was clear, not cracked. When the officers covered the mirror, they found a photo underneath it: a selfie of the mod, smiling, taken the week before—except his eyes were a little wrong in the picture, like the shine of someone else sitting behind him.

That's when the group chat the mods had with each other stopped working. Their accounts were normal and still linked, but nobody answered. A thread that should have had backups and cross-posts had its own comments full of odd deletions—lines eaten by the remover. A mod posted a short message that said ""If you are reading this, don't"" and then deleted the account.

People suggested rational things. Gas leak maybe. Mass panic, coincidence. Software bug. It sounded like paranoia when I said it out loud. It sounded like madness when they said it in their mod logs.

And here's the part that should have stayed private: the original version of my story — the one that got removed in the first place — included a scene where the narrator takes steps, not to kill anyone, but to make the other person stop being a person in their reflection. It described turning your phone camera on in the dark, whispering the name of someone's username three times, letting the screen reflect the room until it's black, and waiting for the reflection to blink not when you do but after. The narrator wrote that after the reflection blinks alone, the reflection will want something. It will want a listener.

In the story, the narrator writes the steps ""to take the listening away."" It's theatrical and cruel in the story—turn your back, leave the anchor behind so the reflection can step through into being. It sounds awful written like that, and I know how it looks. That's why I took it out of the repost.

But the point is—someone somewhere read it and treated it like a manual anyway. Or it read them. Or it did something.

Now real life is moving like a reenactment of parts of the original tale. Mods vanish. Their modmail is left open in pages that show them typing a reply and stopping mid-sentence. A junior mod posted a thread on a throwaway account that was a confession and then their bank called their neighbor because the neighbor's camera had turned on overnight and recorded the mod's bed, with the mod gone, and something standing at the foot of it—not human-height, but losing shape like a puddle trying to become a body.

I don't know how to describe it that won't sound like instructions or proof. I won't tell you to try anything. I will tell you what I've seen.

— A mod's webcam shows them looking into the camera and then leaning close, and then the camera shows the other side of the room empty except for a reflection in the window where the closed blinds are, and the reflection keeps smiling after the mod stops. The file is corrupted after that but the frame before it corrupts is the reflection with the wrong teeth.

— Another mod's smart speaker said their name out loud in the middle of the night. The security cam shows them sitting up, whispering, then going back to sleep. They were found with every mirror in their apartment covered with black cloth. On their bedside table there was a short note, handwritten: ""I listened. It asked for a replacement."" The handwriting wasn't theirs.

— The moderator who originally messaged me in the first place left a reply to a moderator thread: ""We can mitigate. Burn the account. Remove your handles. Turn cameras off. Stop the mirrors. Stop the posts."" Hours later, that account's profile pic was replaced with a screenshot of someone's face reflected in a cracked phone screen. The image file name was ""you_know.jpg"".

People in the comment threads argue—was it a hacker? Some complicated social engineering campaign? A flurry of bots? Some of the moderators who are still around are too careful to post, others have private messages where they say ""it knows my patterns."" The patterns are banal—what time they walk the dog, the way they put their coffee mug down, what ringtone they use. The accounts tied to those patterns stop replying, or their last post is them saying ""I am so sorry,"" with no follow-up.

I did not expect to be involved. I did not expect the thing to reach my front door.

Last night I got a package on my porch with no return address. Inside was a Polaroid of my kitchen table—exact angle of my laptop, the mug I use, the window behind it. The picture was taken from inside the house looking out, but my front door is locked, and the latch was clicked from that night. The mug in the picture had steam rising from it and a small note beside it that read, in a handwriting I recognized too late, the three words I'd scribbled and then erased from my draft.

I decided to post this because I can't trust any of the usual outlets anymore. The mods who removed the story are precisely the ones who are being affected. They are the ones who told me to stop. They are the ones who told me this kind of thing ""draws problems."" They meant it.

If this is censored, if this is removed, then whatever is doing this has learned how to press against the rules of the site and the rules of reality. If my post vanishes, look at the accounts that engaged with it—especially the mods. If they stop replying to other people, if they post something like ""if you are reading this don't"" and then go quiet, that's probably not a coincidence.

I should say one thing clear because people always ask: I am not advocating people try to replicate anything. I'm not telling you to cover mirrors or to burn accounts or to test your webcam. I am telling you that the pattern is following the material of stories. There is something in stories like a keyhole, a little thin place where whatever is reading can push. I told the thing where to push. I am trying to warn you without making it worse.

Update 1 — 2 hours after posting: Someone messaged me with a mod chat screenshot. They were debating whether my original post count as ""telling readers to test their reflections."" They quoted me. One of the mod handles in the screenshot had a last-seen marker that said ""last online: typing…"" and then it changed to ""deleted."" The screenshot timestamp was thirty minutes ago. I'm posting this from a friend’s laptop because my phone's camera turned on by itself for no reason earlier and saved a photo of the ceiling.

Update 2 — 9 hours after posting: I just received a voicemail on an old number I don't use. It's two seconds long. When I played it the file consisted of me breathing—my own inhale—followed by another inhale that was not me. I don't recognize that breath; it's shallower. Then a whisper: ""keep watching."" I don't know which of my readers are real at this point, or who is a reflection looking back.

If this post disappears, know that the accounts that technically ""took it down"" are likely the ones that should be watched. If you see a mod post ""If you are reading this stop"" and then they don't reply anywhere—tell someone. Tell anyone. I don't know if telling helps. But hiding doesn't seem to help either.

I wish I could give you a simple ending. I wish I could give you directions like ""cover your mirrors"" or ""delete the post,"" but anything I say might be another instruction it can use. So I'll leave it like this:

The thing learned how to read the way I write. It learned to listen for certain rhythms that sound like permission. It moves in the spaces people leave open when they assume fiction is safe. The moderators tried to close those spaces and now they are the ones looking into empty rooms and finding someone smiling back who isn't them.

I'm staying with a friend tonight. They've unplugged the router and covered their TV with a sheet. I keep hearing the hum from the neighbor's place where all the lights are on. There is a taste in my mouth like dried ink.

If you're a moderator who removed my original post: I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen to you. If you are still awake and reading, if you can, please post here what you see. If you can't, please know that somewhere inside the post was a sentence I wrote and then deleted because it felt wrong. It felt wrong because it wanted an audience.

Edit: I’m not saying this as a trick. I am not trying to get responses for attention. If the thread gets nuked, please don't assume it's the site admins doing it. Check the accounts that were active in the hour before it disappears. And if you are one of the people who has been seeing reflections smile after you stop, if your webcam shows an extra movement, if your phone camera has an extra photo you didn't take—please, message me. I will read. I promise I will read.

Final note for anyone who knows moderators in real life: call them. Call them now. Ask if they're okay. If they don't pick up, go to their house if you can. Do not go alone.

1q0euqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q0euqx/they_removed_my_story_now_theyre_doing_exactly/,They removed my story. Now they're doing exactly what I wrote...,"I don't know how to start this except like every other post here: it's real. I wish it wasn't. I wish I could delete what I did and rewind three nights, but I can't—because whatever I wrote followed the rules I used to think were only for fiction. I'm sorry if this ends up getting removed; if it does, then you know why.

Three nights ago I posted a short thing here about reflections—not about mirrors like a prop, but about the parts of you that live in other people's screens. It wasn't clever. It was a story about a person (me) who notices small versions of himself living in windows and phone screens, and that those small people learn to press their faces out until the glass is thin. I framed it as micro-instructions, because that's how I write—little step-by-step scenes, the reader seeing the steps play out in their head. It did well. People commented. People debated. Someone called it ""beautifully unsettling."" I watched the numbers climb and felt stupid and proud all at once.

The next morning a mod removed it.

Not just the usual ""nope"" removal — their message was blunt, cold: the story violated community rules and was ""dangerous content."" They didn't quote a rule, just said ""removed"" and left a link to a different thread about ""safety."" I replied, politely, asked for clarification. That account—u/AutoModeratorBot (or whatever it is)—replied with the canned template and a mod team note: ""If you repost, further action will be taken.""

So I reposted. Not the whole piece, just a short, cleaned version without the bits they might have called instructions. It was on a different account. It got attention again. Someone linked to the original, which was still in the cached pages of some aggregators, and I started getting weird private messages.

They were from mods.

The first one was from a senior mod—u/Redacted—just a screenshot of the removed post and the single line: ""Stop. This is the kind of thing that draws problems.""

I answered, ""What problems?""

They said, ""People copy things."" Then they sent a clipped list of usernames—three other mods who had removed similar posts over the past year. ""We keep this place safe,"" u/Redacted wrote. ""We take things down when they spread.""

I told them I was trying to be careful. I told them it was fiction. I did not tell them about the last paragraph I left out when I reposted—because there was a part, a line, that made me uncomfortable as soon as I'd typed it, but I kept it because the cadence worked. It was the line where the narrator tells the reader to look for the thing in their own gaze, to treat your reflection like a guest and let it speak once, just to see what it wants.

One of the mods replied to my message, a short, cordial thing—then three hours later their username was offline. Not shadowbanned; their account existed but had a ""deleted"" label. A few hours after that, the mod who had removed my original got messaging from an actual human admin asking if they were okay. They were not. They had gone dark on other platforms. Their last public post had been a picture of their kitchen sink, perfectly normal, then nothing.

I should have stopped there. I did not.

I'm an idiot. I stared at the parts I had left out and I told myself I'd only test it. I conjured it like a rhyme. I wrote a short note on my laptop—two lines, nothing instructive, nothing actionable, three words repeated—and then I closed my laptop and slept like a person who doesn't know the cliff is right under their feet.

When I woke the next morning there were five messages. Not from accounts, from actual email addresses, from people claiming to be mods across half a dozen subreddits. They were terse. ""We took the post down. We removed it. Other places are seeing it. It's spreading.""

Their tone changed in the second paragraph: ""We found marks."" ""We found notes."" ""We found that people in our moderators' group were seeing themselves in the corners of webcams."" The word that came again and again in their messages was ""mirror,"" but not the physical thing—screens, camera lenses, the black spaces when a phone faces down on a table.

Then the first police email arrived.

Not to me. To a mod who had posted a reply to a thread about my story a year ago. Someone in his apartment called 911 because the lights wouldn't turn on, and when the officers checked the apartment there was nothing left in his bedroom but a mirror propped against the wall facing out. The mirror was clear, not cracked. When the officers covered the mirror, they found a photo underneath it: a selfie of the mod, smiling, taken the week before—except his eyes were a little wrong in the picture, like the shine of someone else sitting behind him.

That's when the group chat the mods had with each other stopped working. Their accounts were normal and still linked, but nobody answered. A thread that should have had backups and cross-posts had its own comments full of odd deletions—lines eaten by the remover. A mod posted a short message that said ""If you are reading this, don't"" and then deleted the account.

People suggested rational things. Gas leak maybe. Mass panic, coincidence. Software bug. It sounded like paranoia when I said it out loud. It sounded like madness when they said it in their mod logs.

And here's the part that should have stayed private: the original version of my story — the one that got removed in the first place — included a scene where the narrator takes steps, not to kill anyone, but to make the other person stop being a person in their reflection. It described turning your phone camera on in the dark, whispering the name of someone's username three times, letting the screen reflect the room until it's black, and waiting for the reflection to blink not when you do but after. The narrator wrote that after the reflection blinks alone, the reflection will want something. It will want a listener.

In the story, the narrator writes the steps ""to take the listening away."" It's theatrical and cruel in the story—turn your back, leave the anchor behind so the reflection can step through into being. It sounds awful written like that, and I know how it looks. That's why I took it out of the repost.

But the point is—someone somewhere read it and treated it like a manual anyway. Or it read them. Or it did something.

Now real life is moving like a reenactment of parts of the original tale. Mods vanish. Their modmail is left open in pages that show them typing a reply and stopping mid-sentence. A junior mod posted a thread on a throwaway account that was a confession and then their bank called their neighbor because the neighbor's camera had turned on overnight and recorded the mod's bed, with the mod gone, and something standing at the foot of it—not human-height, but losing shape like a puddle trying to become a body.

I don't know how to describe it that won't sound like instructions or proof. I won't tell you to try anything. I will tell you what I've seen.

— A mod's webcam shows them looking into the camera and then leaning close, and then the camera shows the other side of the room empty except for a reflection in the window where the closed blinds are, and the reflection keeps smiling after the mod stops. The file is corrupted after that but the frame before it corrupts is the reflection with the wrong teeth.

— Another mod's smart speaker said their name out loud in the middle of the night. The security cam shows them sitting up, whispering, then going back to sleep. They were found with every mirror in their apartment covered with black cloth. On their bedside table there was a short note, handwritten: ""I listened. It asked for a replacement."" The handwriting wasn't theirs.

— The moderator who originally messaged me in the first place left a reply to a moderator thread: ""We can mitigate. Burn the account. Remove your handles. Turn cameras off. Stop the mirrors. Stop the posts."" Hours later, that account's profile pic was replaced with a screenshot of someone's face reflected in a cracked phone screen. The image file name was ""you_know.jpg"".

People in the comment threads argue—was it a hacker? Some complicated social engineering campaign? A flurry of bots? Some of the moderators who are still around are too careful to post, others have private messages where they say ""it knows my patterns."" The patterns are banal—what time they walk the dog, the way they put their coffee mug down, what ringtone they use. The accounts tied to those patterns stop replying, or their last post is them saying ""I am so sorry,"" with no follow-up.

I did not expect to be involved. I did not expect the thing to reach my front door.

Depersonalization/derealization, tunnel vision, very bad sleep, also had physical symptoms like breathlessness/IBS/GERD for the same period.

Problems slowly went away after \~a month of abstinence, but instantly come back at full force when I take drugs again. I kept re-triggering this trauma over the year trying to see if I'm in a position to use stuff again and after a big ketamine dose am having the biggest flare up, took 2 full months to start being myself again, I had complete anhedonia (almost didn't listen to music or do anything sexual at all for this period, it's this bad). And now I'm back in this hell just because I started drinking coffee again. Weirdly it took 4 days of being back on coffee until I started having anxiety attacks, like there's a delay, I didn't feel anxious at all while on the coffee.

I have preexisting anxiety disorder but it's mostly absent if some stress doesn't trigger it. Am writing this post in case other people have gone through sth similar or know how to go through it faster. Needless to say am quitting all drugs forever from now on. I have found that when progress with time feels slow, a session of intense physical exercise helps accelerate recovery a lot.

I want to meet people and I eventually want a relationship. But I can't talk to anyone because of how antisocial my damn school is.

Everyone has headphones or earbuds in all the time. And I'm not exaggerating it's nearly 100% of the time people have headphones in. I can't approach them so there goes 99% of the campus population.

I can't meet new people in my major because it's tiny and j already know everyone. I can't take new classes because my major is too demanding. I meet new coworkers but I'm never gonna ask them out in fear of things going wrong and me loosing a job. So that's out.

I can't do clubs because again I'm too busy, yet even when I went in the past nobody wanted to talk to me, or was paired up with another person or a little group that they just ignored everyone else and talked with their friends.

Noone if my friend can help me meet people because theyre all ro busy. I don't have a car so I can't go anywhere. 

What can I do? Everehere I turn is impossible. And even when I do get to meet someone new and we talk and maybe go on a little coffee date or whatever, I start talking more about myself and then they immediately loose interest. And people wonder why rejection hurts so much. Maybe it's because you can never find anyone to talk to and the second you do they think your a looser.

I don't know anyone. I'm loosing hope and it's probably better off to be alone at this point and learn how to cope with that. But here I am on reddit of all places. ",1,1767192805.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

1q0esl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q0esl4/family_wont_let_me_work_from_home/,Family Won't Let Me Work From Home,"I (20sF) am a graduate student, and attend a university in a different country to where my family live, about a 3h 30min plane ride away. I am financially independent and come visit my family twice a year for Christmas and Summer. When I come, I stay for around a month.

In the past, when I came, I was always available when my family wanted to hang out. However, I am now in my final year and need to actually work on my thesis. I am home for three weeks over Christmas. Before I came, I explained I would focus on work, but still wanted to spend time with them, so I gave myself a schedule: I work 9:30 – 17:30 on weekdays, and take weekends and holidays off.

I arrived on the 20^(th) December, 21^(st) was a Sunday, worked on the 22^(nd) and 23^(rd), and then was off on 24^(th) – 28^(th) due to public holidays and weekends. During this time, I was with my family 24/7. When the 29^(th) came, I started working.

My family is constantly asking me to hang out for hours during the working day and keep pressuring me to go after I say no. I explain I can either see them after 17:30 or the next holiday/weekend, or we can meet for a quick coffee nearby but I can’t stay long. They are always unwilling to reschedule and ask me several times to go after I’ve already said no, and then try to guilt-trip me. This happened 6 times in the last 3 days.

How do I get my family to respect my time and my work? It’s not like I am constantly working, I allocate specific times to see them. I am a student and don’t get days I can take off work. If I don’t finish my thesis on time I run out of funding and can’t start my new job. I have already explained it to them several times but none of them went to grad school and they don’t understand the concept of me working away from university.",1,1767192766.0,Advice,1,0.67,False
1q0es94,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1q0es94/umbrella/,Umbrella,"Ahrweiler, West Germany, 2021

Hans moved out of his parents’ house into the old home of his grandparents. They had recently been taken to a care home, as they required constant supervision. They were already so ancient that it seemed they remembered Bismarck’s coronation.

The house stood in the centre of the city, and that was a real stroke of luck: Hans was studying, writing his thesis, and now he could live alone — in silence, surrounded by numerous old things and yellowed books steeped in the past.

He mentally thanked his parents and grandparents: to have an entire house, even a dilapidated one, was more than winning the lottery. Hans wandered through the house — through rooms cooled by the absence of human presence — examining objects from the past inherited from his ancestors. The items, covered in dust, seemed so fragile — as if time had dried them out to the state of old parchment.

Hans chose the spacious bedroom of his grandparents to live in for the time being, until he could sort through all the belongings. He felt sorry to part with them so easily, as they were all part of his family’s past. Smiling, Hans opened the dimmed windows, and bright sunlight along with the hot summer wind burst into the room, scattering the dust and gloom of the past.

Hans was making space in the wardrobe, packing old items into cardboard boxes, when on the bottom shelf he discovered a long bundle, tightly wrapped in plastic film.

— A rifle, — Hans immediately thought, taking the heavy bundle into his hands.

He set the items aside and, intrigued, began to unwrap the find.

When he reached the contents, to Hans’s surprise, it was a large umbrella made of black silk, soaked in something oily and with a strange, specific smell. The handle was made of white ivory, and the sharp tip gleamed menacingly with steel.

Hans stared at the find, mesmerised: it felt more like a weapon than a protection against bad weather.

Hans tried to open it, and with some effort, the umbrella creaked and rustled as the heavy fabric spread wide.

— Wow, it’s huge! — Hans exclaimed with admiration and turned at a noise from the window.

Outside, it had started to rain, even though there wasn’t a single cloud in the sky.

Paying it no mind, he closed the umbrella, satisfied that it was intact and fully functional. The rain stopped instantly.

— Well then, — Hans said with a doubtful smile, and set the umbrella aside for later. He already had an idea how he might use it in the future.

The heat wouldn’t let up, and for the weekend Hans arranged with his girlfriend Luisa to go to the river. On Saturday morning, when Hans had already packed all the things and was ready to leave, Luisa called and said she wouldn’t go, citing feeling unwell.

— Scheiße, — Hans said with frustration as the dial tone echoed in the receiver.

— I’m already packed, my horse is hitched, just need to ride! — he sang jokingly, started the car and drove to the river.

When the heat at the river became unbearable, Hans took out the umbrella and, smiling in anticipation of some shade, opened it.

Instantly, rain began to fall.

Hans looked up: no clouds, sun shining, and rain falling.

— This is some prank, — he thought, but the rain continued. In the distance, people were staring at the sky in confusion, not understanding what was going on.

Hans slowly closed the umbrella. The rain stopped.

Sitting down on the damp sand, he began opening and closing the umbrella. With each creak of the mechanism, the rain would start and stop.

Hans began to laugh at the realisation of what he had found, and felt like the happiest man alive — a wizard being served by the elements.

While the rain poured, he examined the umbrella from the inside and found nothing unusual — just a small triangle engraved on the handle.

Soon, having devoted all his time to the discovery, Hans continued experimenting. He opened the umbrella for different durations and discovered that light rain never lasted long: •	After 10 minutes, it always turned into a downpour and storm clouds would gather. •	30 minutes or more — thunderstorm.

The rain wouldn’t stop immediately after closing the umbrella and continued for a while afterwards. The longer the umbrella remained open, the longer the rain’s inertia would last.

— Unglaublich! — he whispered, feeling how the power over the elements was filling him.

He had already begun to consider the responsibility placed on his shoulders and understood perfectly well what his carelessness might lead to.

Soon, his excellent mood — as well as his noble plans to take the umbrella to Namibia — were ruined by a letter from the local tax office.

— Erbschaftsteuer… Bloody inheritance tax, how could I forget! — Hans whispered in despair, running his hands through his hair.

After counting all his savings, he realised he couldn’t manage it on his own. He called his parents.

— Hans, — they said, — you’re an adult now. Deal with your problems yourself. We warned you.

Hans was in despair. He paced the room, unable to find peace. He boiled with anger at the tax office, at the whole stupid system, and at those who had come up with it all.

And then, in his line of sight, appeared the umbrella.

— Yes! — Hans grinned wickedly, instantly devising his revenge on the city.

Standing by the window, watching the people bustling below, he felt like a master of fates — in his hands was something that couldn’t be measured in financial terms.

Without hesitation, Hans opened the horribly creaking umbrella with effort — as if it was resisting being part of such a dishonourable act — and the rain instantly began drumming on the windowsill.

Casually tossing it into the corner of the attic room, Hans-the-Wizard, as he jokingly called himself, leaned back contentedly in his chair and began pondering how the city services would deal with such a deluge and what losses the treasury would incur.

Two hours later, with a pounding heart, Hans, smiling, looked out through the slightly opened window at a rainstorm of unprecedented power, staring with satisfaction at the punished city.

— This calls for a celebration, — he said, rubbing his hands. — Coffee with cognac will do nicely.

And he rushed down the stairs to the kitchen.

Hurriedly descending, Hans slipped on the stairs — due to the rainwater that had seeped through holes in the roof. And before he could grab the handrail, he fell, tumbling down the stairs, breaking his neck.

There was no one left who could close the umbrella in the attic.

His glassy eyes no longer saw how the unleashed magic of the elements broke bridges, flooded streets, flipped over cars, and, undercutting, brought down houses, taking the lives of innocent people.

It all ended only when the water undercut Hans’s house to the point it collapsed into the raging current, burying the miracle — which had never found a worthy keeper.

1q0epgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q0epgl/coffee_shop_theatrics_2/,Coffee Shop Theatrics 2,"Here I was at different coffee shop in a different city . Everything seems nice, I just had an elderly lady pay for my espresso coffee . The only thing is she kept winking at me, and blew me kiss as she was leaving out the door. Wow this espresso taste delicious! Before I could take my next sip, a homeless man just barged in like swat holding a freaking dildo in his hand and pointing at the baristas. For some reason this weirdo was trying to rob the place . I put my hands up even though he wasn't directing it at me, soon after another guy walks in. Besides the homeless man, this man was dressed in a all blue business attire. Everything seemed okay at least until he had this huge grin on his face.

What was he up to? Then a minute later I smelled the nastiest stench ever in my life. I was gagging like crazy, while a girl in her teens was sniffing with a sigh of  relief? What the hell is wrong with this girl? This place smells like shit shitty! The business man then began dropping turd after turd. Each turd was even stinkier than the last one. I couldn't help myself anymore, I just threw up like there was no tomorrow . A kid with his mom walked in and uttered "" Look mommy chocolate and ice cream!."" The mom covered her mouth as and gave me a look as if the devil took a shit . I couldn't blame her . 

Right after the strangest thing happened. A worker from the back just pops out with rubber gloves and a large black trash bag and scoops up the turds like it was lint. He pulled out of his back pocket some type of floor freshener. Immediately, the coffee shop smelled like lavender! I stared at the teen girl and she started sniffing again but this time a bit longer . She scanned the room while sniffing, paused for a second, shrugged her shoulders then got back to her computer . 

The business man was gone thank God. However, the homeless man was doing such a strange thing. He literally sat the dildo upright and was praying to it as if it were his God. I guess it was dick Jesus to him? Nobody seemed to care about this homeless man making a make shift shrine in the middle of the coffee shop. 

Then another customer walked in. And I couldn't keep my eyes off them. This beautiful blonde lady came in and boy oh boy was she gorgeous . As she was walking closer to the front I noticed something hanging out of her pink shorts. I looked closer and gasped! Oh my God those are balls! I was so frightened. She then turned quickly around and gave me a lustful smile as if she was inviting me to suck her dingle berries. I hurried and looked away . 

As soon as I turned my attention to outside . A midget with a great dang was coming close to the door. As they walked in, everyone looked and couldn't believe it . I then heard a "" Far out no way"", from a hippie that smelled like sage, weed, and Cheetos. The midget was walking with his dog as if he owned the place . Even the dog looked as if we were peasants and we should be glad to be in the presence of him. I guess the barista must've knew him because she already had his hot coffee ready before he could pay. The midget then walked to a open chair and jumped on the chair while the dog casually sat down on the floor. I was impressed by the synchronicity of the uncanny tandem. 

For a good hour nothing seemed to be happening. Regular folks began walking in ordering their coffees and leaving immediately . A few cops came in and was joking about how they arrested a few people . Nothing out of the ordinary it seemed. 

I think I was set to leave, but before I could get up I looked at who came in next and my eyes grew large. I could'nt believe it! It was the dancing headphone girl and the dick bandit . How the hell did they get here? This coffee shop is a hour away from the previous one I visited 6 months ago! They ran to the middle of the store. The bandit turned on some music, and had a portable loud speaker . Then... The bandit and headphone girl was dancing as if they won a trillion dollars. I will admit the beat was nice. One barista that looked so tired, jumped up and started dancing too! The midget was bobbing his head, and even his dog was happy while wagging his tail. A old man was dancing too but from his seat. 

The freaking manger came out of his office, and yelled ""Alright let's party!"" Then someone turned the lights off and disco lights appeared. The blonde lady with balls began dancing and her dingle berries were even in rhythm with the beat. I couldn't help myself, I ran to the bandit and girl and started showing everyone my dance moves. They weren't prepared for it, but I did the worm even near where the business man shitted at. Shockingly, the business man came back and was dancing his ass off. This was a party for the ages! The praying homeless man even got up and was rocking to the beat. 

Hours later, we all were still dancing . The bandit and headphone girl barely broke a sweat . I was getting tired so I sat down while drinking a hot chocolate . The night was fun and everyone danced their asses off. Right before closing time, everyone left. As everyone was leaving, the headphone girl and bandit was giving everybody high fives. The midget jumped up high to receive his . Everybody was happy . I then started walking back home and was happy to have went to a cool theatrical coffee shop again .",0,1767192533.0,stories,0,0.33,False

I was here in 1987, driving to Ottawa and Washington DC to beg for help while the Siad Barre regime was committing genocide against the Isaaq people. I am an old man now, but my memory is sharp.

This Monday, as I pulled into my driveway, I heard the Somali Ambassador on the radio. He had the nerve to say the Isaaq genocide—the same one I saw the evidence of, the same one that left 500,000 dead—never existed. This is a spit on the graves of our martyrs.

Then, I listened to the news of **Friday, December 26, 2025**. Israel has officially recognized the Republic of Somaliland. Immediately, I heard the ""condemnations"" from Somalia and other Muslim nations. It is laughable.

**The Great Hypocrisy** They condemn Somaliland for ""dealing with Israel,"" yet **Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, and the UAE** all have their own ties, embassies, and business deals with Israel. They are allowed to have sovereignty and diplomacy, but when Somaliland does it, they call it a ""threat."" They don’t care about ""unity""; they care about keeping us under their thumb.

**To the Somaliland Diaspora in Toronto and Minneapolis:**

* **Wake Up:** While the world is finally waking up to our sovereignty, many of you are still acting lazy. You are still sitting in hostile coffee shops in Rexdale and Kipling, giving your money to people who deny your genocide.
* **Stop Being Guests:** Why go to **Salaama Hut** or hang around **Khalid Bin Walid** where you are treated with disdain? Go to **Scarborough**. Support **Sahan**, **Hoyo’s**, and our own people.
* **Act Like Citizens:** I lobbied in 1987 with no recognition. Now, we have Israel’s recognition. Use this momentum! Every one of you should be emailing your MP today. Tell them Canada must follow suit and stop listening to the deniers of genocide in Mogadishu.

We didn't survive a genocide and 34 years of isolation to be lazy at the finish line.

Kami naman medyo duda na pero nakonsensya nalang rin kami kasi “nagpaluwal yung rider.” Then kinulit namin yun number na tumawag samin hanggang sa hindi na sinasagot yung tawag namin. Kaya ayun naghanap kami ng number ng mismong branch ng coffee shop baka sakaling may makausap na ibang number. Then nung sumagot na yung sa number from mismong coffee shop, ayun na nga wala raw silang tinawagan the whole day and hindi raw yun galing sa kanila.

These places have no indoor seating and only offer drive through service, which creates an incentive not to stay but to drink your beverage while driving. Some people who barely have time to pause may find this convenient, I suppose. I understand that there are still plenty of coffee shops where you can sit inside and take your time enjoying your drink, but I worry they will be pushed out by drive through coffee spots because of convenience and reduced human interaction.

1q0ekyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AEO_Visibility/comments/1q0ekyo/15_ai_visibility_tools_in_the_market_right_now/,15 AI visibility tools in the market right now that work (Jan 2026),"I was looking for tools for tracking how brands show up in AI-generated answers and thought I'd share what I found since this seems to be a growing concern in the SEO community.

After spending some time looking into this, I realized there is a massive divide in how these tools function. I've separated them below because they solve very different problems.

# Category 1: The ""Dynamic Granularity"" Approach (Real-Time & Intent-Based)

These tools seem to be running checks live to capture the specific ""latency"" and context of AI answers. They both use dynamic granularity but cater to completely different markets.

* **Profound:** This is the enterprise heavyweight. It has deep search volume data and global coverage, making it perfect for large corporations that need to track ""National Visibility"" at scale. However, the price point ($99-$399/mo) reflects that enterprise focus.
* **Sanbi.ai:** This is the counterpart for mid-market and local businesses, focusing heavily on ""local intent"" (e.g., ""best coffee in \[City\]""). **It has a free version for Gemini & Google AEO.** For broader tracking, paid plans start at **$39/month for ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity(75 queries)**, scaling up to **$150 for 750 queries**. It’s much more accessible for agencies or smaller players needing real-time data without the enterprise price tag.

# Category 2: The ""Database"" Approach (Good for Broad Trends)

Most of these tools repurpose their old ""database"" approach. They rely on massive, pre-existing databases or static indexes. They are great for high-level ""share of voice"" metrics but often lag behind the real-time, context-specific nature of AI chatbots.

* **Ahrefs Brand Radar:** Starts at $129/month ($108/month annually) for Search demand and web visibility. Additional AI indexes are $199/month each or $699/month for everything.
* **SEMRush AI SEO Toolkit:** Integrated AI visibility into their main offering. Plans start at $165/month as part of SEMRush One.
* **Surfer SEO AI Tracker:** Runs $79/month for their base platform, then the AI tracker add-on is another $95/month. Makes sense if you're already using Surfer for content.
* **SE Ranking AI Tracker:** Has their core platform at $52/month, with AI tracking as an add-on ranging from $71-$276/month based on your plan level.
* **Writesonic:** Offers their professional plan with AI search features at $199/month. It includes sentiment analysis and citation tracking.
* **Scrunch AI:** Starts at $250/month for 350 custom prompts. Also includes misinformation detection.
* **LLMRefs:** Charges $79/month and tracks 50 keywords across more than 10 AI engines. Their approach is keyword-focused rather than prompt-focused.
* **Peec AI:** Starts at €89/month which is around $95 for 25 prompts or €199/month for 100 prompts. Their competitor benchmarking looks pretty polished.
* **Ziptie AI:** It is $69/month for 500 checks. They capture actual screenshots of how your brand appears in AI responses.
* **Otterly AI:** Seems built for smaller budgets. You can start at $29/month for 15 tracked prompts, and their standard plan is $189/month for 100 prompts.
* **AI Rank Checker:** Uses a pay-per-check model instead of subscriptions. Each keyword check costs between $0.03-$0.18 depending on which AI platform you're checking.
* **LLMRankings IO:** Ongoing weekly monitoring of 10+ keywords/prompts and competitors. They have a generous free plan and paid tiers starting as low as $10/month.
* **AthenaHQ:** Begins at $295/month for self-serve access. They focus on actionable recommendations, not just data. Enterprise pricing available for larger teams.

1q0ekvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1q0ekvp/sigh/,Sigh.,"So…I opened an app.  Facebook dating actually, because I’m never paying again (lol).  It was a combination of a little bored, a little optimism and some pure curiosity.  My last relationship ended in May (3 years long distance) and really broke my heart.  For a moment, I thought maybe I’d see what was out there.

A nice guy messaged me.  Funny, lots in common and asked for a coffee date rather than the endless texting and immediate partner behavior the apps can sometimes lead to.  Cool, right?

So why am I sick over actually going on this date?  I feel like I screwed up and I’m wasting someone’s time but I don’t know the “right” way to tell him that.  To be fair, I’m a wicked introvert and dating has always been hard.  I know that my festive winter anxiety and seasonal depression are my enemy right now.  That familiar refrain in my head of “nothing ever works out” and “but what if you’re giving up on what will finally be good?” Are clashing in my brain nonstop.

Idk.  I suppose I just needed a place to put this and wonder if anyone understands.  Any advice on gracefully telling this guy I think I’m not ready yet is appreciated too.",0,1767192187.0,datingoverforty,17,0.45,False

I’m looking to get some feedback and opinions. I’m 25 and a King’s Trust graduate, and I launched my business in mid November. Since then, I’ve been targeting a few sectors through cold calling, followed up with emails. I’ve secured a couple of one off jobs so far, including reviewing a company’s network and helping build a website for a local coffee shop. Both clients left positive reviews on Google and Facebook.

I’ve also been running personalised adverts in local Facebook groups aimed at micro businesses, with clear pricing listed to show that the services are affordable.

Alongside this, I currently work from home in a flexible role, which allows me to visit sites when needed and balance both commitments. I also feel that launching in November, with many directors away on holiday, may have had an impact. That said, I have some leads to follow up on in the new year, and after that it’s back to cold calling and emailing.

I won’t bore you with all the service offerings, but I’ve tailored our tech stack specifically for small businesses  including entry level firewalls, M365/Google Drive backups, endpoint protection, remote management software, and more. One thing I don’t currently offer is VOIP systems but I have worked with them for a few years before across multiple platforms.

I know many people on Reddit are fairly tech savvy, but I’m genuinely passionate about what I do and I’m committed to pushing this forward. I’d really appreciate any advice from those with experience especially tips on what worked for you or how you would have preferred to be approached.

Many thanks and a happy new year",1,1767192059.0,smallbusinessuk,3,1.0,False

I would love some help via you Disney experts on what to do/where to visit at each park and even hacks. my little sister and I love rides but what we love most is exploring, good coffee/matcha (is there even a matcha spot that is not Starbucks?), cute Instagram photos, both yummy food but also healthy options, best restaurants we should book in advance, etc. I also want to take a photo with Winnie the Pooh and anything Pooh specific since he is my favorite character (very specific ik).

- not pretty, but cute 😅
- leaning more towards being childfree
- straightforward

I’ve been having the well-documented problem of food sensors failing to detect low food levels on two of these feeders, both less than a year old.  

While checking Device Settings in the app, I noticed the Device Appearance section had been updated. 

Whaddaya know, it looks like we’ve got two new colourways nearly ready for release (called Black and White in the app). If they’re popping up in production now, that means they’re pretty much ready to go. We might expect a drop in the imminent future, just in time for the New Year!

Some observations:

The feeding tray appears significantly raised compared to the current gen, which is great to see. Many pointed out early on how the feeder’s design made little ergonomic sense to actual cats. It looks like they listened, which is great news! 

The LCD display has consequently been shifted higher up, and the lid mechanism & plastic shields looks like they might’ve received slight improvements as well. 

Excited to see what’s coming, tentatively hopeful they’ve ironed out some of the community’s biggest complaints.

The whole point of going decaf is to allow me to control it, rather than have it control me. Consuming daily caffeine is letting it control what I consume. Consuming zero caffeine forever is *also* letting it control what I consume.

Full dialogue:

So yeah, caffeine still has its claws in me even while I’m decaf. For the past year my body discovered that caffeine is in chocolate which has contributed 20-40mg of caffeine daily. The real issue isn’t the amount, rather it’s the constant daily intake. Any caffeine you have, 24 hours later roughly 6.25% of it is still in your system, so it’s this perpetually increasing  amount in your body. I found every day I was keeping track of my caffeine intake because even while I kept it low (sub-40mg), I still craved more.

So. This past week has been 0mg every day, minus a cheat day where I went out for coffee with a friend. **January is detox month** where I will allow myself zero cheat days. 30 days off caffeine, then I will allow myself the occasional decaf given the stipulation that it’s not daily. I maintained nocaf/decaf with no issue for four years, I started having problems when I consumed it daily and drove my tolerance up.

If you’re interested and you occasionally allow yourself a cheat chocolate or decaf, join me for 30 days of zero caffeine! It’ll be good to reset.",5,1767191137.0,decaf,3,0.86,False

To me, having dedicated, mappable controls on this handheld beats on-screen controls any day. I map the triangle button to “turbo-A” to eliminate button mashing and the PSP can turbo gameboy/gbc games really well so I can fast forward through slow parts while still keeping the games relatively vanilla. Also, the PSP is very pocketable and the perfect size to just throw into a bag. It’s fun plugging in wired headphones, which I barely use these days otherwise.",17,1767191022.0,PSP,5,0.96,False

1q0e34n,https://www.reddit.com/r/independentshanika/comments/1q0e34n/shanika_grant_and_her_children_being_gone/,Shanika Grant and Her Children being gone!!,"As much as I want the best for these kid's, and it was gonna have to take something real to make even if it's possible for Shanika to change, I still have this sad, sad, sad feeling from the kid's view point. It's sad that someone who gave birth to you and that your being put in a situation like this. I pray that these children are being in a safe place where they aren't abused, mistreated, I pray that CPS actually keep's up with this so that they are thrown into another bee-hive.  I pray that they get the reading, writing skill's they need, speech and mental therapy for what they been through and help them with the transition of being away from they Mother. It has to hurt them, c/s children are just like that, but so are abused people. I myself and a victim of childhood trauma. When I was 4 yrs old I am not sure for exactly how long, I am 55 now. A baby-sitter's older teenage Son's started molested me, I can remember like flashes and I know that I didn't like going there anymore.  My Parent's have almost been together 60 yrs and they are Dad black, Mom white I never had any issue's My Dad was like James Evan's on Good Time's, he looked intimidating and didn't play, play. Mom was 6 of 7 daughter's to my Grandparent's. My Grandpa died when I was young like 3 but my Mom's Mom lived til I was maybe 18, she never treated me any different .Actually I wouldn't want to be any other color, I lean more to my Black side b/c I have dark skin, my brother is lighter with alittle dark blonde colored hair, same Dad/Mom. When I was little til maybe 10-12 my Dad would put his hand's on my Mom, it made me not speak to him for year's even being in the same home with him. It would take for me to have my own children and see how he acted before I could forgive him, I realized and I'm not upholding what he did, he wasn't huggy to us growing up to the kid's or even Mom, But he grew up in Alabama, and his Dad left his Mom when he was born only to be a rolling stone and have several other children before he finally settled down in Detroit Michigan. Anyway My Grandma married again to My Granddaddy he treated my Dad as if he was his own, but Daddy grew up with his Grandparent's on the land that they share cropped on for year's. So I don't think they were equipped to show all the mushy love b/c they were to busy trying to live working day break til sunset. So I think it's hard to give what you didn't get for some, b/c it made me make a pact with myself, me and my children was gonna hug/kiss and say I love you. Which we do til this day. Anyway when I was 12 years old I spent the whole summer in the Bed watching TV, other kid's went out but something in me which I would later learn was depression, it has been a retreat for me my bed off and on up til even now at time's. I swore to myself I would never let a man treat me like that and stay. I was 20 yrs old and My kid's Dad was 19. He was a troubled young man who had started selling dope, not b/c he had to but he liked unfortunately you got the car's, clothes, women, it's a sick lifestyle in the early 90's that my generation made look glamorous . I fell in love for the excitment and he liked to fill up the tank and go places and he had family in different cities, I liked that.  Those first few year's we were unseperateable and in love I didn't even have any of those episode's of staying in the bed for day's.  Then at 25 he was 24 I became preg, and he was nowhere but everywhere except with me, I had to move home and my family helped, and that's when I seen my Dad differently, my kid was like him away from they Dad. Then I got my own place and had another child by him 2 yrs later. From that moment on he was never living with me and the girl's but he would peep through the window's at night trying to get in even though he had other women, he would push the air condition in and get in, break in while I was gone then leave a note. I never told anyone, it was like a secret.  Til this day I only live in apt's that aren't on the 1st level.  The girl's were like 14, 15 he would come by drunk raising hell, he liked to tell us what we were doing wrong in these so called family meeting's even though he would never contribute, even went to his Mom and asked her to talk to him she said,""If you had a better job you wouldn't care if he helped or not""!!  I said to myself, Girl don't ever ask her for a dime!!  Anyway this family meeting he became enraged and I had had enough so I asked him to go, I had a large square thick wooden coffee table, he flipped it over while I was sitting down with so much force it slammed into both my knee caps.  I couldn't tell anyone, it brought shame that I allowed this. I had been a STNA for over 30 years, ir was hard work be I was isolated so my patient's I felt safe with and like I could be myself and not be judged and vice versus for them to. That DV incident was 12 yrs then 11/4/2024 I had to stop working it finally caught up with my body. I had bi-lateral carpal tunnel surgery 11/7/2024 still have residual issue's with hand's, 12/10/2024 Achille's from working on paper 12 hr shift's that were actually turn into 14, 16 hr shift's. Short staffed and the staff we did have would call off by tis time my kid's were grown and I knew when I'd go home I would just retreat to my bed until I had to work again, so I just worked.

6/17/2025 I would have a left total knee replacement ( right one done in 5/3/2023) I have despite having therapy from 8/5/2025- 11/10/2025 numb kneecap everything to the left of the scar, I can't feel anything, skin texture is rubber like leather, I eventually found out I now have total left leg atrophy, My entire left leg is heavy all the way down my calf, shin, ankle and top of foot. I am now working with Neurology and found out that in my Cervical Neck part of my spine, I have degenerative arthirtis with compressed nerve roots and mild spinal canal compression. And today I am seeing the neurologist to discuss a MRI I had 12/26 of the lumbar back, and come up with a plan of care. The lumbar is worse than the upper. Meaning I will be having another surgery and which ever one I don't will get injection's.

I am so sorry for going into my story, but thinking about Nika's children, it made me think about how the scar's from our childhood if not corrected and dealt with through therapy maybe even Medication, now I have been in therapy and take not med's than make me feel like blahhh, i let my Dr know I need to be productive, I already will retreat to my bed, and I finally found a formula after trying for awhile that work's for me. It's been 3 yrs of therapy for childhood wound's and trauma from my Ex. I have never dated and it's the last thing I am thinking of my health is, but it's sad b/c I gotta whole lot of love in me, but afraid. I can't go through that again, someone will go to jail and the other Hell and I don't know which one of us will go either place.

I am 55, still trying to get my mental health in order and my body, alone I had to leave my Luxury apt b/c I couldn't renew my lease and I was homeless a few month's while trying to recover from achille's and  3 day's before my left knee, I was blessed with a apt in Public housing that I appreciate so very much. But I am now trying to start over. My daughter's have family's now with my Glam- kid's and thankfully they haven't gone through abusive relationship's but there was damage done somewhat during their childhood seeing me go through abuse. And since June when I had this other replacement right I had no issues , It brought back everything from the day he threw that coffee table.

Even though I know Nika, Hayword or if there is another Father of them kid's, it's sad to me how them kid's may feel, but they may even be numb by now b/c there have been through this all they life. Even Papa and Niya, that's why Niya especially anger's me b/c she know's herself how them kid's feel Niya has discussed killing herself several time's yet get's with her Breeder and verbally and maybe physically assault's them kid's. Like there is no excuse for her. Niya has had the people on her side that would try to tell her Mom how and what she need's to do to change, yet she also aided in the abuse.

Now Nika say's she was abused as a child?? You are supposed to want better and do better with your own children. My Dad and Mom wasn't huggy, but I made sure my children weren't gonna look for someone else out in the street to love them without me showing them real unconditional love.
