Seeking people who work in the city to catch up for a coffee, drink or a quick lunch to break the monotony of the working day‚Ä¶ 

Preferably similar age and stage of life I guess, although could be refreshing to have something other than kids to talk about.

I work in property finance and funds management (exciting, I know), and hobbies include trying to get to the gym a few times a week, if I can.

1l1aq52,https://i.redd.it/7tkie2pohg4f1.jpeg,New setup,"Hello! 

I purchased the Baratza encore ESP and De'Longhi Dedica Arte yesterday after a few weeks of research for a set up within my budget. I was originally going to buy the bambino, however got chatting to a woman in the store and she was buying her second De'Longhi dedica - the first one lasted her 6 years and apparently didn't miss a beat. She seemed to have a foundational idea about espresso so I took her on her word! It was cheaper than the bambino, so I went for it. I'm grateful I did. After some tinkering with grind size, it's making really smooth shots for a low end machine, honestly better than some of the local cafes (why are some cafes espresso so burnt and bitter all the time??). 

Even if it only lasts me a couple of years, it will get me through uni. I've been paying $7-8 for a coffee everyday so this will help cut back on that daily expense. 

My question is, should I buy a bottomless portafilter? What is the taste difference with this kind of portafilter on a low end machine? 

Any other recommendations to add to my new set up are welcome. Cheers. ",4,1748844872.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1l1aocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1l1aocs/ethical_dramas_novel_alone_on_her_birthday/,"""Ethical dramas Novel""- Alone On Her Birthday","""Leland... help me..."" The whisper slipped out before she realized.

""Say that again?"" The voice was cold and sharp.

Nadia Woodward's head snapped back as fingers tangled in her hair, yanking her into a glare of icy eyes. ""Jason? What the hell‚Äî""

He shoved her against the fogged-up glass wall, gripping her jaw tight. ""Who did you think you were gonna see in my room, huh?""

""Let me go!"" She struggled, but he held firm.

""You had the balls to mess with me. Now you're gonna‚Äî""

BANG‚Äî

Nadia jolted awake, her head hitting the bus window.

Even now, three years later, that night still haunted her‚Äîthe hospital stay, the rushed marriage, the mess she'd made of everything.

Then, screams. The bus lurched, skidding into a roadside ditch.

Chaos erupted‚Äîshouts, crying, people scrambling for the exits.

""Move your ass! Get out now!"" someone yelled in her ear.

She looked down at the smashed-up cake box in her hands. 'Happy freaking birthday.' With a clenched jaw, she climbed toward the emergency hatch.

Sirens wailed in the distance. She saw an ambulance parked near a sleek black Audi. The paramedics rushed out, but a tall guy pushed past them, leaning into the car.

Her heart stopped.

Jason. Her husband. Holding some woman like she was made of glass. Of course. Abby. His dream girl who'd gone overseas to chase her master's degree. The one he'd been obsessed with.

Her hands trembled as she reached for her phone.

Jason Black picked up on the second ring, voice clipped. ""What?""

""Are you coming home tonight?"" She fought to keep her voice steady.

""Can't."" Click.

That was it. Two syllables, and the line went dead. No explanation. No concern. Just‚Ä¶ her, shoved aside like an afterthought.

Meanwhile, Abby got the royal treatment‚Äîcradled in his arms, whisked away like some damsel in distress. Nadia bit down on her lip until she tasted blood.

Unbelievable. The man who ""forgot"" their anniversary could recite Abby's class schedule by heart. Who missed her birthday dinner last year because of ""work"" was currently playing knight in shining armor.

Pathetic. She'd actually thought‚Äîhoped‚Äîhe might remember today. That maybe, just maybe, he'd show up for her birthday.

The ambulance rolled past, giving her a perfect view through the window - Abby's head resting on his shoulder, his lips moving against her hair.

Something inside her chest cracked open.

By the time traffic cleared ‚Äî some poor woman had gone into early labor ‚Äî night had fallen. Nadia dragged herself home to an empty mansion.

The cake sat on the counter, smashed beyond recognition. She lit a single candle. The flame trembled. ""Happy birthday,"" she whispered to the darkness.

\*\*\*\*\*

At the City Hospital emergency room, Abby was wheeled out on a gurney, and Jason was by her side in a flash.

""How's she doing?"" he asked, his voice low and tense.

Abby's forehead was wrapped in a bandage, her face pale as death, trembling like she'd just escaped a horror flick. When she locked eyes with Jason, tears welled up fast.

The doctor piped up, ""Mild concussion. Her spine's taken a beating before, so she needs to stay in bed and take it easy for a while.""

Jason's eyes darkened as he took in Abby's ghostly pallor.

""Doc‚Ä¶"" Abby's voice was soft, almost fragile, as she pleaded, ""I came back to the city for a killer role in this hotshot director's film. I can't just walk away from it.""

The doctor yanked off his mask, his tone all business. ""You're in no condition for anything heavy-duty. If you have to work, you need someone by your side 24/7, looking out for you.""

""Thanks, Doc. I'll make it work."" Abby's teary gaze flicked to Jason, a wobbly smile breaking through. ""And thanks for rushing over to get me and hanging out here. My agent's flying in tomorrow morning, so you should go catch some Zs.""

The doctor had just made it clear she couldn't be left alone, and her agent was still a day away. No way Jason was bailing.

He pulled out his phone and called his assistant. ""Hey, get those urgent files sent to the hospital, stat.""

Then he turned to Abby, his voice steady but warm. ""I'm sticking around tonight. You just chill and rest up.""

Abby's eyes lit up for a moment, but then worry crept in. ""You staying here‚Ä¶ won't Nadia flip out? Maybe you should‚Äî""

""Don't worry about it,"" Jason said, brushing it off. He nodded to the nurse to take Abby to her room, then lit a cigarette, exhaling a slow plume of smoke into the sterile air.

The next morning, Jason dragged himself home, looking like he'd been chewed up and spat out.

He hadn't slept a wink, and his mood was as dark as the bags under his eyes. Kicking off his shoes, he shuffled into the house.

As he passed the living room, he paused. Normally, Nadia would be done with her yoga by now, flipping pancakes or ironing his suit for the day. But today, the house was dead quiet, like it was holding its breath.

He pushed open the bedroom door, and his already foul mood turned arctic.

The room was empty. Smack in the middle of the bed sat a pristine document, the title glaring up at him: Divorce Agreement.

Jason didn't even flinch. Nadia's dramatics were old hat. She'd pulled this stunt before‚Äîstorming off to some swanky hotel whenever she was in a huff, only to waltz back in a few days later like nothing happened.

Abby's big return and that car crash fresh off the plane? The gossip rags were probably eating it up. He believed Nadia must've seen the headlines and decided to throw a fit.

He glanced at the closet. His shirts hung in neat rows, organized by color, but no suit was laid out for him today.

Slamming the closet door shut, he grabbed the papers off the bed. As he skimmed the text, a cold smirk tugged at his lips. ""Well, damn,"" he muttered. ""She's got some serious nerve.""

\*\*\*\*\*

Nadia had been out since the crack of dawn, hunting for a new place to crash. If divorce was happening, she sure wasn't sticking around No. 8 Crest Manor.

She hit the jackpot‚Äîa cute little apartment up for a quick sale. It was cozy, not some sprawling penthouse, but the price was right, and it came with all the furniture.

She slapped down a deposit and headed back to start packing.

The fancy gated neighborhood didn't let taxis roll through, so Nadia got out and hoofed it.

""What's this? Strolling in at this hour? Mr. Black doesn't pay you to slack,"" the security guard said, giving her a lazy once-over.

Jason wasn't big on strangers in his space, so they only had a part-time cleaner. Nadia liked running the show herself‚Äîcooking his meals, picking his outfits‚Äîand when the house was spotless, she'd give the cleaner a day off.

Their wedding had been on the down-low, just parents and a handful of close buddies. To the rest of the world, Jason was still the guy carrying a torch for Abby, all tragic and romantic.

So, nobody had a clue Nadia was the lady of No. 8 Crest Manor. They just saw her as the help.

""Mr. Black's old flame is back in town,"" the property manager, Ellen Smith, a gossipy woman in her forties, said, poking her nose in while on her rounds. ""That crash yesterday? He was right there, playing knight in shining armor. Three years, and you couldn't lock him down? That's rough, hon.""

""She's not totally out of luck, though,"" the guard said, smirking like he knew something juicy. ""Didn't she snag some rich boyfriend? So, what's good? You two planning to put a ring on it?""

Nadia's steps slowed.

One night, after a screaming match with Jason, she'd twisted her ankle. The jerk had scooped her up, carried her inside, then ditched her without a word.

The night manager caught the whole thing and got it all wrong: Nadia threw herself at him and ate pavement.

To shut it down, Nadia said it was her boyfriend, who just so happened to wear the same high-end threads as Jason.

By breakfast, the staff's group chat was on fire. A maid landing a wealthy guy? Some were jealous as hell, others just laughed.

""Over it. Dude was a total bust,"" Nadia said, flashing her face at the gate scanner.

""Guys cheat, sweetie. Look the other way, and you're set. A rich boyfriend? That's your golden ticket,"" Ellen said, her tone all fake pity, like a housekeeper had no right to standards.

Click. The gate buzzed open.

Nadia sauntered through, tossing a glance over her shoulder. ""When I say bust, I mean bust. Big talker, zero follow-through. Acts like a boss but flops when it matters in bed. Why bother?""

She spun around‚Äîand nearly walked smack into a car easing out.

A custom silver Maybach, so sleek it screamed money, with a license plate that practically winked. Through the crystal-clear windshield, she locked eyes with the man in the back.

Jason's face was all sharp angles and rugged good looks, his expression hard as granite. Those deep, piercing eyes pinned her in place, cold and unrelenting, like a storm about to break.

# Chapter 2 The Man

""Mr. Black!"" The security guard clocked the car and dropped into a bow like he was greeting royalty.

""Mr. Black, Nadia's not always goofing off, you know. But if you're looking to switch her out, I've got people lined up‚Ä¶"" Ellen sauntered over, all slick smiles, whipping out a business card holder like he was pitching a deal.

A job with the Black family was the ultimate score‚Äîfat paychecks, cushy perks, and a chance to brush shoulders with the city's elite. People would sell their souls to snag Nadia's spot.

Jason sat in the car, silent, his presence heavy enough to make the air feel like lead.

Every fake grin around him stalled, faces stuck like they'd been slapped. It was a blistering July day in Brookshire, but a cold sweat trickled down their spines.

The tension was so thick one could choke on it.

A minute dragged by, then the window hummed down. Jason's voice sliced through, low and arctic. ""If you're running such a tight ship, why're you out here yapping? Don't like the job? Beat it.""

Ellen's smile curdled into something desperate, his legs wobbling like he might hit the deck and start groveling.

Jason wasn't just a player‚Äîhe was the game. One word from him could tank a company's future in Brookshire before the sun went down.

The crowd bobbed their heads like spooked pigeons. Then Jason's razor-sharp gaze landed on Nadia.

""Get in,""Jason said.

""I've got things to do.""

His brow twitched, just a flicker. ""Don't test me.""

Nadia swallowed a sigh. With every eye on her, she slid into the car, hugging the door to keep as much distance as she could from Jason.

The Maybach glided out of the complex, smooth as silk. Jason lit a cigarette, the smoke curling around him like a bad vibe.

He blew out a cloud, his words sharp and sour. ""So, the guy who's all big talk out there's a total dud in bed, huh?""

Nadia stared straight ahead, lips sealed, not giving him an inch.

Nadia stared straight ahead, lips sealed, not giving him an inch.

She flicked her eyes over. Her divorce papers, first draft. ""I'm out. I want a divorce.""

The air in the car turned to ice, so heavy it felt like the walls were closing in.

Ray Miller, the driver, clutched the wheel like it was a lifeline, eyes locked on the road, doing his best to act like he wasn't trapped in the middle of this mess.

""Give me one damn reason,"" Jason said, his voice sharp and cold as a winter blade.

""It's all there, plain as day.""

Nadia nudged the center console up, half-braced for him to sling the papers at her.

Jason leaned back, eyes narrowing, his voice slow and sharp. ""Three years of marriage. The guy's loaded but can't deliver on emotional or physical needs. No time for 'real love.'""

His tone grew colder with every word, the last bit practically growled.

Nadia didn't flinch. It was the unvarnished truth.

Three years hitched to Jason, and he'd showered her with cash‚Äîdesigner bags, sparkling jewels, the whole nine yards. But after that one night three years back, he hadn't laid a hand on her.

He barely showed up at No. 8 Crest Manor, maybe six months total in all that time. Forget heat in the bedroom‚Äîthere wasn't even a spark of basic care.

This marriage was a hollowed-out husk. Nadia could scream she was Mrs. Black from the rooftops, and no one would bat an eye.

Jason's eyes still closed, like he was mocking her. Then he let out a harsh laugh. ""Three years of you sitting pretty, doing nothing, and now you think you deserve my money? Get outta here.""

Sure, to everyone else, Nadia was just a lazy housewife. But in secret, she'd been grinding, stitching up high-end gowns to keep her skills from rusting. The pay was peanuts, but it was hers.

Asking for a cut of his fortune? That was just to screw with him. He'd paraded his mistress like a trophy‚Äîshe needed to hit back.

Nadia was no stranger to Jason's venom, but his words still burned, slicing deep into her chest.

She turned to the window, hiding the hurt. He took it as her running from him and grabbed her chin, yanking her face back to his. ""You spread your legs for my money back then, and now you're pulling this divorce stunt for the same damn thing. Nadia, you're as low as it gets.""

His words were knives, each one twisting deeper.

She clenched her fists, staring at the floor to keep her composure. ""Jason, I've been your wife for three years. I've cooked, cleaned, kept your world spinning. Even a maid gets a paycheck.""

His hand darted to her earlobe, pinching it hard enough to make her wince. ""A maid wouldn't touch those earrings in a million years.""

Nadia tried to twist free, but his grip was a vice. She wouldn't put it past him to rip the studs out in a fury, leaving her ear bloody.

Her face was a mix of defiance and pain, and it only stoked his anger. ""What, you found some guy who can actually get it up for you?""

Nadia bit her lip, terrified her voice would crack and betray her. Her silence screamed guilty to him.

His eyes glinted with cruel amusement as he eased his grip, his thumb grazing her earlobe almost gently. ""Married or divorced, I'm the one who decides. Not you.""

Nadia didn't understand.

When Abby ditched him and left the country, he'd married her in a fit of spite.

Abby was back in town, and it had Sophie's mind racing.

'Why's he still holding on to me when he could chase the love he really wants?' she thought, twirling a strand of hair around her finger. 'Is it just his ego? Or is he scared a divorce would pin the ""homewrecker"" tag on Abby and torch her perfect career?'

Papers signed or not, Nadia had to make her stand clear.

""No one even knows we're married. Everyone still thinks you're pining for Abby. She's back now, kicking ass, and the world would throw you two a parade for getting your fairy-tale ending,""she said.

Jason, about to dial his phone, froze and snapped his head toward her. ""You'd be fine with that?""

Her heart seized, a raw, jagged pain tearing through her.

Her eyes stung, but she forced the tears down. ""It's only a matter of time."" If she didn't say it, Abby would.

Jason locked eyes with her, his gaze drilling into her soul, frustration rolling off him in waves. ""I told you, I decide when this is over.""

He chucked the divorce papers at her, the pages smacking against her thighs. ""Clean up your own mess.""

Nadia opened her mouth to fire back. ""I‚Äî""

His phone buzzed, cutting her off. His chief secretary, asking if they should push the board meeting.

""No, I'm almost there."" Jason hung up and barked at Ray, ""Pull over.""

It was a lousy spot to grab a cab, but Ray didn't dare argue. He flicked a glance at Nadia in the rearview mirror.

She spoke first. ""Stop here. It's not far. I'll walk.""

She stepped out, leaning down to the open window. ""If you change your‚Äî""

Thwack‚Äî

A black credit card flew out, skidding into the dirt, followed by his irritated growl. ""Buy whatever the hell you want.""

Before she could pick it up, the Maybach roared off, kicking up a cloud of dust that burned her eyes.

""I'm done with this place tonight!"" she hollered at the shrinking taillights, needing to let it out, to draw a line in the sand.

She turned to head back and pack, her heart still racing. At the entrance, she scanned her face to get in and caught her reflection‚Äîher ears and cheeks were blotched with ugly purple bruises.

'Damn, that jerk really went for it,' she cursed silently.

She'd just reached the front of No. 8 Crest Manor when someone yelled her way. ""Hey, Nadia, grab that water and bring it in!""

To everyone who didn't know better, she was just the Black family's maid, but running errands for the property crew? That wasn't in her job description.

Still, Jason had it out for her, so even the maintenance guys acted like they could boss her around.

The property manager, Ellen, clocking her messed-up appearance, gave a smug grin. ""Got put in your place by Mr. Black, huh? Look, sunbathing on that fancy terrace, flopping around in the pool‚Äîyou really thought you were hot stuff? Newsflash: you're no princess. A sparrow doesn't turn into a swan.""

Nadia's blood boiled, but she let out a dry, biting laugh. ""I'm done playing lapdog for Jason. And you lot, sneering down at me? Take a hard look in the mirror before you start running your mouths.""

She was through being the perfect little Mrs. Black. No one was going to prance around, acting like they owned her, ever again.

Ellen's eyes nearly popped out, floored. ""Done? You're draped in designer labels you'd never sniff without Mr. Black's cash. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. Him keeping you around for three years? That's your lucky break of the century.""

Nadia spun to leave, ready to ditch this whole scene, when a heavy hand clamped her shoulder.

Ellen shoved a pair of grimy gloves into her hands. ""Don't get cute. Move that water now, or I'm telling Mr. Black you're half-assing it.""

Nadia's stomach dropped. She glanced back and saw it‚Äîa sleek sedan parked behind the property crew's rickety cart. And there, leaning against the car door with that infuriating cool, was Jason.

# Chapter 3 He's All About The Drama Queens

Jason was on his phone, giving Nadia a look so smug it could sour milk.

Ellen didn't even spare her a glance. 'How the hell does she think she could waltz in like a diva and drop the divorce bomb?' he thought.

Nadia let out a sharp scoff. Right in front of Jason, she ripped off her filthy gloves and flung them at Ellen's face.

Ellen wasn't ready for it. His clipboard and pen clattered to the ground. ""You call yourself a manager? Maybe go back to square one!""

Nadia snapped. ""You can try to boot me out, but you're not setting foot in No. 8 Crest Manor. He's into those loud, extra types. Sure, you've got the attitude, but sweetie, you're way past your prime!""

She was out the door soon anyway‚Äîwhy play nice? Plus, sneaking in a jab at Jason? Total cherry on top.

Jason's eyes turned to ice, his knuckles whitening as he clutched his phone.

Nadia stormed inside, grabbing a glass of water. The front door swung open, then shut, and something hit the entryway shelf.

When she finished packing and headed out, she saw it‚Äîher phone.

'Did Jason actually come back just because I left it in his car?' she wondered.

This time, Nadia wasn't playing dumb. She hopped into the Porsche Cayenne in the garage and peeled out.

The car was one of Jason's wedding gifts. She barely drove it‚ÄîBrookshire traffic was a nightmare‚Äîso it'd been sitting there, collecting dust.

But even if she walked away from Jason's fortune, this ride was hers. Pre-marital property.

The thought of leaving that cold-hearted jerk behind had her practically beaming. She slammed the gas, the engine roaring like it was cheering her on.

On the road, her bestie, Kate Baldwin, called. She'd seen the latest gossip and was worried Nadia was falling apart, so she tried to drag her to a bar to let loose.

Nadia wasn't ready to pop champagne just yet‚Äîshe wanted to settle in first‚Äîso she passed.

The apartment was spotless, but Nadia had this weird thing: she couldn't sleep in a new bed without zapping it with her de-mite machine.

She was on her knees, buzzing away at the mattress, when the real estate agent strolled in like he owned the place.

""Knocked forever, but you didn't hear, so I let myself in,"" he said with a shrug.

Nadia shot him a look. ""What's up?""

""Uh‚Ä¶"" He flashed a fake grin. ""So, the landlord just called. Bad news‚Äîthis place isn't for sale anymore.""

""But I paid a deposit.""

""We're super sorry. We'll refund you double, no problem.""

This morning, they were desperate to sell. Now it's suddenly off the table.

Nadia grabbed her phone to dial the landlord, but froze when she saw the last incoming call. Him.

'Well, big surprise,' she thought bitterly. 'Bet Jason answered that call.'

If she couldn't see through this little game, she'd be a complete fool.

She tossed the de-mite machine onto the bed. ""Buying this place was my choice. That jerk doesn't get to call the shots!""

The agent flashed a nervous, fake grin, practically sweating bullets. ""Ms. Woodward, I'm just the go-between here. You really think I'd have the guts to‚Ä¶"" 'mess with the head honcho of the Black Group?' he thought, not daring to say it out loud.

Nadia tried every trick in the book, but the guy just shook his head, that infuriating smile stuck in place. A room for the night? Nope, not happening.

Out of options, she slung her bags over her shoulder and headed to her best friend Kate's place.

It wasn't about the cash‚Äîshe could afford a hotel. They just gave her the creeps, plain and simple.

Kate was rinsing off the day's grime when her phone lit up. She scrambled out of the shower, still dripping, towel half-on and a shower cap perched on her head. When she spotted Nadia wrestling luggage out of her car, her eyes nearly popped out.

""Well, hell's bells!"" Kate hooted. ""Takes some sleazeball shattering your heart to remember your bestie's got your back, huh? But eloping already? Pump the brakes, girl‚Äîlet's at least Netflix and chill first!""

Nadia, caught up in the vibe, yanked too hard on her suitcase and got her finger stuck. ""Ow, damn it, ow!""

""Oh, crap, my bad!"" Kate snorted, doubling over. ""That museum's royal robe is counting on your fancy fingers. You go and break one, and Emperor's gonna haunt me from the grave!""

Nadia lost it, laughter bubbling up and chasing away the gloom that'd been weighing her down. ""Oh, please. I'll just ship you off to sing at his tomb. Big-shot pop star like you? He'd be living his best afterlife.""

They were still cackling when Jason's mom, Madge, called, all but demanding Nadia swing by for dinner.

""She got any clue you ditched the house?"" Kate asked, her voice dropping with worry.

Nadia shook her head.

To both their families, Nadia and Jason were the poster kids for wedded bliss‚Äîpolished, polite, perfect. Nadia had to keep Madge happy to lock in the her family's future and, more importantly, her brother's shot at survival.

Truth was, Madge treated her better than her own blood ever did. She could dodge Jason's calls all day long, but letting Madge down? That'd hit her where it hurt.

When Nadia showed up alone, Madge's face darkened like a storm cloud. ""That little punk! I told him to pick you up, and he leaves you to haul ass over here by yourself? What a clown show!""

Only Madge could roast Jason like that and not bat an eye.

""It's cool. He's just buried in work,"" Nadia said, slipping her hand into Madge's with a smile. ""How you holding up?""

Madge had been fighting a laundry list of health problems since Jason's sister, Chloe, came along. She was always brewing some herbal remedy, the faint scent of it lingering on her like perfume.

""You give me a grandbaby to fuss over, and I'll be right as rain!"" Madge said with a playful nudge, dropping her voice to a whisper. ""You drinking those soups I sent?""

Madge had been dropping off these so-called ""health"" tonics, swearing they'd get her ready for motherhood. Subtle? Not even a little‚Äîit was her way of saying, ""Hurry up with the grandkids.""

Nadia wasn't dumb, but Jason wouldn't touch her with a ten-foot pole. No amount of soup was gonna change that.

Sometimes, she toyed with the idea of overnighting a batch to Jason's office just to screw with him. But then she'd picture Madge's warm smile and worried eyes, and she couldn't bring herself to let her down.

""Every last drop,"" Nadia said, flashing a sweet grin.

""No rush, honey,"" Madge said, giving her hand a squeeze. ""You and Jason stay over tonight‚ÄîI've got a good feeling you two are gonna make some magic happen.""

'Uh, hold the phone‚Äîwhat?' Nadia was speechless.

Before Nadia could even process that, the front door swung open. The housekeeper gave a quick bow. ""Mr. Black, Ms. Black, welcome home.""

Jason's gaze snapped to Nadia, a glint of scorn flickering in his eyes.

'Crying for a divorce one minute, kissing up to Mom the next. Nice act,' he thought, his jaw tightening.

""Mom, look what I scored for you."" Chloe sauntered in, handing Madge a velvet box with a smug grin. ""Emerald pendant from the auction. Top-tier stuff."" She flicked her eyes to Nadia, her smile thinning. ""Oh, didn't know you'd be here. No gift for you, sorry. You're cool with that, right?""

Chloe played sweet for Madge's sake, but everyone knew her claws came out when Mom wasn't watching.

To Chloe, Nadia was a nobody‚Äîsome gold-digger who'd conned her way into the Black family. No way she deserved her brother.

Madge, practically glowing to have her daughter back, clapped her hands and ushered everyone to the table. ""Come on, let's eat!""

Nadia, always the one to keep things running, hopped up to spoon some noodle onto Madge's plate. But the second she sank back into her chair, Chloe slid her bowl across with a lazy smirk. ""Half a plate for me, thanks.""

Nadia started to rise, but Jason's leg hooked hers under the table, his touch firm and deliberate, pinning her in place.

Her breath hitched, eyes darting to his, just as his low voice cut through. ""What, did you sprain your wrist at that auction?""

Chloe scoffed, tossing her hair. ""She's already playing servant for you. What's a little extra for me?""

""I don't touch noodlea at night."" Jason's tone was ice as he slid his fork toward Nadia, his eyes daring her to argue.

Sure, he swore off carbs after sunset, but that didn't stop him from turning Nadia's life into a culinary obstacle course. Steamed pumpkin? Too soft, too hard, too bland, too sweet‚Äîhe'd send it back every time, his complaints sharp enough to sting.

Now, though, with Madge's eyes on him, he was all smooth charm. Nadia's defiance flared.

She jerked her leg free and stood, her chin lifting. ""Fine. You starve. I'm eating."" She grabbed Chloe's plaate and strode to the rice warmer, her pulse hammering.

She didn't need to look to know Jason's face had darkened‚Äînot because she was helping Chloe, but because she'd dared to cross him.

Dinner was a battlefield. Jason sat there, his expression a brewing storm, barely touching his plate. Madge, oblivious to the tension, chatted with Nadia, their laughter warm and easy, like they were the only two in the room.

Madge's giggles faded as she glanced at Jason, her smile softening. ""I had the staff prep the guest suite. You and Nadia are staying tonight.""

Jason's eyes slid to Nadia, cold and unreadable, but he didn't say a word.

After dinner, Nadia busied herself clearing plates while Madge slipped off to check the rooms. Chloe, never one to miss an opportunity, dropped onto the couch beside Jason, her voice low and conspiratorial.

She said,""Jason, Abby's back. She texted you the second she hit town‚Äîshe's still got it bad for you. You're not even into Nadia. Why not cut her loose and go for Abby?""

Jason's gaze turned glacial, his voice a low growl. ""What'd you say?""

# Chapter 4 Divorce Off The Table

""She totally played you, Jason! You'd never have married her if she hadn't pulled that stunt!"" Chloe snapped, her arms crossed tight. ""Mom's tossing her the best meds, but it's pointless‚Äîyou don't even want her knocked up!""

Nadia, wiping her hands in the kitchen, froze as their voices carried through the doorway. Her heart sank, and she quietly backed away.

""Brother, I can't even tell my friends you're hitched. Her? She's a walking embarrassment. Abby's a freaking superstar now‚ÄîMom wouldn't care if you went back to her. Just give me the green light, and I'll deal with Mom,"" Chloe pushed.

""Abby's career is blowing up‚Ä¶"" Jason mumbled, flicking his lighter to spark a cigarette.

Nadia's throat tightened, her eyes stinging. Of course he wouldn't sign the divorce papers‚Äînot when it'd make Abby look like the other woman.

As always, Abby came first.

Her pride was already ground into the dirt by Jason. Storming out there now would only torch the last shred of self-respect she was holding onto.

""Oops!"" A maid carrying a tray of coffee collided with Nadia, her eyes widening. ""Oh no, ma'am, your hand!""

""It's fine,"" Nadia brushed it off, even as her skin bloomed red from the burn.

Before she could react, Jason grabbed her wrist, dragging her to the sink and shoving her hand under cold water.

His jaw was clenched, and her staying quiet about the burn only seemed to rile him up more.

""What, you're out here telling everyone I don't lay a finger on you?"" he growled, his voice low and sharp.

Nadia locked eyes with him, unfazed. She had never said a word.

But Chloe had been causing a scene at No. 8 Crest Manor, dropping by when Jason was never around. She'd decided they weren't even sharing a bed.

Nadia hadn't bothered correcting her‚Äîit wasn't exactly a lie.

""Am I wrong?"" she asked, her tone steady but challenging.

""I'm not into you,"" he shot back, his words cold as ice.

""Then why string me along? Just divorce me,"" Nadia said, her voice light but pointed, like she was daring him.

His grip on the cigarette tightened, veins bulging on his hand. He stared her down for a long, tense moment before turning and stalking off.

""Grab some coffee after dinner, hon,"" Madge chirped, gliding into the living room with a warm smile. She waved at the maid to bring Jason a fresh mug, but he flicked his hand, clearly not in the mood.

""Nadia, sweetheart, take it to him,"" Madge said, nudging Nadia with a grin.

Nadia flashed a dazzling smile, picking up the steaming cup. ""Don't break Mom's heart now, okay?""

They'd agreed to play the happy couple in front of family, so Jason wouldn't cause a scene.

His eyes darkened as he took in her glowing smile, something stormy flickering in his gaze.

Nadia had a cool, refined beauty, but when she grinned, she was pure fire‚Äîespecially those eyes, their upturned corners practically begging for trouble.

She held the mug to his lips, tilting her head with a playful smirk.

""Want me to feed you, babe?"" she teased, her voice dripping with honey as she looped her arm through his.

Jason's hand shot to her wrist. He downed the coffee in one quick gulp, waiting until she set the mug down.

Then, in a split second, he tipped her chin up and kissed her hard, the bitter taste of coffee lingering on his lips.

Nadia's breath hitched, her mind spinning.

Madge, watching the ""sweethearts,"" giggled and threw her hands over her eyes. ""Alright, you two lovebirds, it's been a long day. Go get some rest!""

The bedroom door barely clicked shut before Nadia spun on him. ""Jason, you're such a jerk!""

""What? You're always moaning I don't touch you,"" he shot back, that infuriating smirk curling his lips.

""Yeah? Well, I'm done with half-measures!"" Nadia grabbed his tie, yanked hard, and pushed him onto the bed. She swung a leg over, straddling him with fire in her eyes. ""If you won't walk out, then give me a damn kid.""

In a flash, Jason flipped her, pinning her beneath him, his gaze smoldering.

He brushed a stray curl from her cheek, his fingers tracing her face slow and deliberate, like he was memorizing every curve. When they grazed her lips, his eyes darkened, heavy with something dangerous.

""Go to sleep, Nadia. You can have it all in your dreams.""He rolled off and strolled to the bathroom, leaving her seething.

Nadia gripped the sheets, her nails digging in as she swallowed a scream. She knew he'd pull this. 'Why did I keep throwing myself at him, begging to get burned?'

She snuffed out the room's scented candles and tugged a sachet from under her pillow. Madge was playing dirty‚Äîswapping her comfy PJs for a whisper-thin slip dress that screamed ""grandbaby fever.""

Too bad her son was stubborn as a freaking mule.

Nadia was still fuming when Jason appeared behind her. ""Wear it, don't wear it‚ÄîI don't give a damn,"" he said, his voice cold enough to sting.

That one cut deep.

She'd never shake the memory of slipping into a skimpy bunny outfit, posing seductively on the bed, only for Jason to freeze, blink, and toss a blanket over her, muttering about ""keeping his eyes clean.""

These past few years, no matter what she tried‚Äîsultry looks, bold moves‚ÄîJason wouldn't budge.

Fine. If he was gonna act like he didn't care, she'd play that game too.

Fresh from her shower, she draped a shawl over her shoulders and switched on the blow-dryer. Then Jason was there, crowding her, his arms wrapping around her waist, pulling her close.

Nadia froze, flicking off the dryer and meeting his gaze in the mirror.

His cheeks were flushed, his breathing rough, and something very eager pressed against her hip.

""That coffee‚Ä¶"" he growled, voice low and gritty. Something was definitely up with it.

No wonder Madge had pushed them to stay. She was practically their baby-making coach.

Jason's hands slid over her hips, hot and teasing, setting her skin on fire. ""You're the one who poured it for me.""

His touch was electric, sparking heat that raced through her. Nadia leaned in, craving his kiss, but he pulled back at the last second, leaving her hanging.

""I'm getting kind of hard, so your divorce card's no good,"" he taunted, his voice dripping with smug challenge.

He was toying with her, and it pissed her off.

Nadia's blood simmered, but she flashed a sassy grin. ""Big whoop. If you're not using it, it's just a sad, limp stick.""

""Limp?"" Jason's laugh was sharp, like a blade. ""Who was flat on her back in the hospital for a week, fever through the roof, three years ago?""

""That just means you suck in bed‚Äîall brute, no finesse.""

""That was your wake-up call‚Äî"" He stopped short, jaw clenched, torn between shoving her away and dragging her closer.

Nadia clocked his quickening breath and decided to fan the flames. But before she could, his phone blared from the bedroom.

Jason's eyes snapped clear. He pushed her off and bolted for the sound.

Nadia trailed him, spotting his phone on the nightstand. The screen glowed: Abby calling.

""Hey,"" he answered, voice soft as silk.

""Jason, I'm losing it,"" Abby's voice trembled through the speaker, dripping with tears. ""My career's just taking off‚Ä¶""

Nadia sidled up, looping her arms around his waist, her voice pure honey. ""Still got the heat, huh? Let's see if you've gone soft.""

Back in the day, mistresses got burned at the stake. Now they just strut in and steal the show.

'I'm the one with the ring‚Äîlet's dance,' she thought.

1l1anwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l1anwu/im_so_hurt_by_my_maid_and_matron_of_honor/,I‚Äôm so hurt by my maid and matron of honor.,"I‚Äôm really hurt and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I posted in this group before my bachelorette weekend to get advice so part of this story may seem repetitive if you saw that post.
I have a Maid of Honor & a Matron of Honor ( I was maid of honor for one of them and was supposed to maid of honor for the other before her wedding was called off). My other bridesmaids are my two sisters and my fianc√©s little sister. 

I threw bachelorette trips for both of my maid and matron of honor when it was their turn. I did everything from reservations, getting payments from bridesmaids, setting up decorations, getting Airbnbs, and getting gifts. 

Now that it‚Äôs my turn I feel disregarded and uncared for. All I asked for was one weekend of things with them two, like doing nails, threading eyebrows, getting a wax, just self care type things and maybe getting drinks. We planned for Memorial weekend, and that was the plan. I told them I didn‚Äôt need anything big and crazy how I did with theirs. Well before the sunday before that weekend my matron of honor, she told me she could only do something on Saturday because she had a Memorial Day barbecue to go to on Sunday. That hurt my feelings enough because all I had asked for was one weekend. 

Anywho on that weekend we got our nails done and since there wasnt a plan that they made, we were doing things on the spot. After our nails I went to get a wax, and I told my matron of honor I would call her when it was over. After it was offer my maid of honor decided to go home to shower and I called my matron of honor to let her know we could do something else after my maid of honor was ready. She made a comment like ‚Äúwell what are we doing, I feel like I‚Äôm just sitting at home‚Äù. After she said that I kinda just broke down and cried and told her that it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be my responsibility to have made a plan. I told her that I did so much for theirs and mine felt so last minute and unthought of. She tried apologizing but just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if that hurt your feelings‚Äù and tried to push the blame more on my maid of honor. I stopped her and said that it was more about being thoughtful to even just be generous with her time, which she didn‚Äôt do because she planned to go to some barbecue during one of the two days we were supposed to do stuff. Anyways I blew it off still upset but I didn‚Äôt want to ruin my whole weekend so I kinda just bit my tongue after that. We ended up going to dinner, which was nice but pretty awkward since they made little effort to keep conversation going (they aren‚Äôt really friends but they‚Äôve known each other for forever because they are both my childhood best friends). The next day my matron of honor went to get coffee and go to the pool with us. But it felt like she was just there to say she was there after I had gotten upset over the phone. She sat on her chair away from us most of the time because we were taking pictures, and I invited her to take some with us or at least come with us bc no one else was at the pool, and she declined. She also didn‚Äôt get in the water until the last bit of time. She didn‚Äôt want to have a drink and wanted to know how long we were going to go for because she was still going to go to the barbecue. 
She ended up sending me a whole apology text on Monday, it said ‚Äúbachelorette day‚Äù several times which annoyed me because we had talked about it being the weekend but she‚Äôs the one who made it a day. I also think that it was made with chat GPT bc there are a lot of long dashes in it. I still haven‚Äôt responded to it. 
Anywho my sisters found out about this and tried to fix it this weekend. They invited my maid of honor and my fianc√©. My fianc√© was out of town, but to my understanding my maid of honor was supposed to be there. Apparently she was even supposed to surprise pick me up this morning but I wasn‚Äôt answering my phone, so one of my sisters came to get me instead. After my sister came to get me she briefly explained that we were going to brunch and my maid of honor couldn‚Äôt get ahold of me. Sure enough when I checked my phone there was a message from her that she wanted to go to brunch at this new place. I said sorry for not answering it and that my sister was there to get me. I also asked what she would be wearing so I knew how to dress as I was getting ready. She sent a thumbs up but never saw the one about what to wear. Then when we were leaving my sister asked me to text her that we were on our way. She said she wasn‚Äôt sure what time we were going so she wasn‚Äôt ready. I kinda got the feeling she was going to flake but I thought surely not, so I said no worries if you‚Äôre late you can still come the place doesn‚Äôt close until 2 and we can wait. She then said that she wouldn‚Äôt be coming since I spent all last weekend with you I‚Äôll let you spend some alone time with your sisters let me know if y‚Äôall are doing anything after.
I immediately just broke down and cried. My maid and matron of honor have pretty much always been my only two best friends. And I felt like such a burden. Why would they ditch me, why would they both do something like this? I just said I didn‚Äôt understand why they were doing this and went to the bathroom. I talked to my mom on the phone and went back out to eat with my sisters. After we talked about something else for a bit I said that I never had responded, one of my sisters said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry I said something‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt know what she said. Later she said something like ‚Äúwell your friend probably hates me Now but I don‚Äôt really care‚Äù which is nice for standing up for me, but I hate confrontation. So all I can think about is how awkward my bridal shower is about to be and how awkward it‚Äôs going to be on the morning of getting ready. My heart just feels broken and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like it just hurts because if it were the other way around I know I would want to do anything for them to make sure they felt celebrated.

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows.

Someone whispered, ""Mr. Patel's such a saint. He still sticks with her after she went nuts and hurt others with a knife.""

Another person said bitterly, ""If my wife pulled a stunt like that, I'd kick her out the same day. She's a total disgrace to Mr. Patel.""

Someone else chimed in, ""If Ms. Patterson's father hadn't passed away, and she hadn't moved in with her uncle, she would've married Mr. Patel ages ago. Audrey would never have had the chance.""

Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.

Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no-name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big-shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.

But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'They all think I don't deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself.'

It was July. The sun blazed down, but Audrey felt chilly all over, especially her heart.

Ashwood had a glossy cover story‚Äîsomething about correcting troubled youth and improving their mental state. But what went on inside was a nightmare.

Audrey, a 23-year-old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.

During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch-black isolation‚Äîuntil she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised to change.

Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.

""Zoe's ran a bath for you. Let's go home and wash off the bad luck,"" Clayton said to Audrey.

Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.

Clayton was always well-groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn't smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.

Ignoring Clayton's grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger-side door and got in.

The driver, who'd already opened the back door, glanced at Clayton in confusion.

Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn't used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.

Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn't blame her for her little temper.

He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.

Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.

It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest‚Äîhis childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three-year-old daughter, Luna Patterson.

While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn't give Clayton back to her.

Tears streamed down Valerie's face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.

Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.

Valerie stumbled into Clayton's arms, sobbing like she'd just survived a war. ""Audrey, please don't hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven't done anything. You're getting it all wrong.""

Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.

Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. ""Clayton only let us move into your house 'cause we had nowhere else to go.

""I swear I'll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don't scare my baby, okay? She's got autism.""

Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. ""Valerie's hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?""

Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton's arms, shaking like a leaf.

Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.

She thought to herself, 'So that's her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my husband's got no side piece, or I pack my bags and quit the game.'

Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. ""Believe it or not, she cut herself.""

""No way,"" Clayton shot back without missing a beat.

He was convinced no one knew Valerie's talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she'd hurt herself just to frame Audrey.

Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. ""Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You're keeping her and her kid on the side, and I'm supposed to just be cool with it?""

Clayton's colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.

""My hand... Clayton, it hurts,"" Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.

Guilt flashed across Clayton's face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, ""My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.""

Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, 'To protect that woman's reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place.'

Clayton must've caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, ""I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.

""She had a fever for days. They've had a hard time. You shouldn't trash Valerie like that.""

Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. ""I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They're living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should've been more generous, huh?""

Clayton took a deep breath and said, ""Vally doesn't blame you. She's already dropped the charges. It won't affect you.""

Audrey sneered, thinking, 'Won't affect me? Due to my so-called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.'

Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton's fathers got sick. Valerie's father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton's father.

After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.

Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie's divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.

\*\*\*\*\*

The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn't wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.

She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.

When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, ""Dinner's almost ready, ma'am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.""

Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold-rimmed glasses and said, ""Dry your hair first. I'll wait to eat with you.""

Anyone walking in might've thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.

But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.

Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, ""It's a bit late today. I'll have Zoe buy your favorite fish tomorrow.""

Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.

Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.

Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.

Now, Audrey didn't even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.

# Chapter 2 Don't Keep Pushing

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.

They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton's favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.

She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the past.

Clayton's mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton's money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she'd return it when she was sure Audrey wasn't a gold digger.

Their finances had basically been split fifty-fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame-hungry wannabe.

Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn't believe how blind she used to be.

The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman's reputation.

Clayton's hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. ""Audrey, I can explain that thing.""

From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, 'If you had anything to say, why didn't you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What's the act for now?'

She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but irritation, and he said to her, ""You can leave Ashwood once you calm down.""

He even said, ""Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you're gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it's time you felt what being truly alone is like.""

He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.

When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn't even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, 'Say what you want, Clayton won't believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you'll look.'

Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet-talking Clayton, ""Clay, the doctor just said I can't draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me 'cause she loves you too much.""

Audrey didn't hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.

She'd clenched her teeth and thought, 'If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don't drag decent people down with them. I'm not interested in his lame excuse.'

Clearly thrown by Audrey's sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, ""Why do you hate Vally so much? She's just a friend.""

Audrey didn't buy that for a second. She couldn't believe he still pretended not to know how Valerie felt for him.

After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three-year-old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.

Audrey sneered inwardly, 'What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman's husband?'

If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she'd finally go crazy one day.

She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, ""Your family owes Valerie. That's your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I'm supposed to repay your debt too?""

She thought bitterly, 'Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn't get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically.'

She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, ""You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?""

Her voice shook with rage. ""What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?""

Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.

She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.

Clayton's expression turned more serious. He hadn't expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, ""I know you lost your job, but I'll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I'll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.""

Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, 'If I fall for his crap again, I'm the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once, and what makes you think I'll believe your promise again?'

She'd seen through him completely. Clayton's heart had already gone rotten. He'd always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn't know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.

After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.

Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.

She said, ""Don't bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You're gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.""

""I'm not divorcing you,"" Clayton shot back without hesitation.

Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn't breathe. He thought, 'She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?'

The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.

For once, the always-composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. ""You lost your job, and I'll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.""

He thought he'd already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton‚Äîthe admired, respected, and untouchable top-tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should've known when to quit.

But Audrey's eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.

Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn't name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.

He muttered, ""It's all in the past. Can't we let it go?""

""Clay? Is Audrey back?"" Valerie's voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high heels.

Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical‚Äîsaving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.

However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head-to-toe brands. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was footing the bill.

She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. ""Audrey, if you've got a problem, take it out on me. My hand's ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.

""That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.""

Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. ""Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?""

Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. ""You heard her, right? That thing's a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.""

Valerie's eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless, wounded eyes toward Clayton. ""Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I‚Äî""

Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. ""Vally's already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don't need to keep pushing.""

# Chapter 3 Clear The Mess

Valerie gently touched Clayton's arm and said, ""Clay, it's fine. I know Audrey hates me. I'll just leave now.""

But she didn't move a muscle. Instead, she looked up at Clayton with wide eyes, full of dependence and reluctance.

Clayton picked up the broken pieces and placed them on the coffee table. He was afraid Audrey might lose it again and end up hurting Valerie.

Clayton and Audrey got married just after they met each other. Back then, he was pissed at his family and randomly asked Audrey, who'd just dropped off a file at his law firm, if she'd marry him.

Audrey's reaction was unforgettable. She was first shocked, then pure joy. She told him she was an orphan, just landed a job at a foreign company, and didn't have much to offer compared to him. She promised she'd work hard, catch up to him, and be worthy.

Clayton made sure to sign a prenup, and the two of them got their marriage license without much fuss.

In the year since, Audrey worked her ass off at the office and at home. She arranged everything well, made his favorite meals, and never once complained.

Clayton could see how much she loved him in her eyes. He enjoyed being the center of her world. He believed she'd never actually leave him, and everything she said was just because she was angry.

Clayton said to Valerie, ""Vally, can you go back for now?""

""Huh?"" Valerie looked like she'd just been slapped.

Her eyes went wide in disbelief, and she thought, 'Is Clayton seriously kicking me out for Audrey?'

""I need to talk to Audrey. I'll come see you later,"" he added, looking at her with a gentler gaze, like trying to soothe a sulking child.

""Alright, I'll wait for you,"" Valerie said, but her heels didn't budge.

She turned to Audrey with a smile that barely masked her bitterness. ""Audrey, Clayton and I have known each other since we were kids. If anything were going to happen between us, it would've happened a long time ago. Don't you think?""

Just then, Zoe burst through the door, breathless. ""Ms. Patterson, come here, Luna collapsed. Her face is blue. I didn't dare move her.""

Valerie let out a sharp gasp and spun toward Clayton. ""What should I do? She had an episode yesterday too. Clayton, I'm scared.""

Clayton didn't hesitate. He turned around and went toward the living room. ""Calm down. Let's take her to the hospital right away.""

""Thank goodness you're here,"" Valerie said, sticking close to him. ""Feel my hands. I'm freezing.""

As Clayton grabbed his car keys, he suddenly thought of Audrey. His hand paused mid-air.

He turned back and looked at her, saying. ""Vally is still new to Ironhaven. She doesn't know the hospitals here. I'll take Luna to see the doctor first. Can we talk later?""

Audrey stared back at him, her face blank. She didn't give him any response.

Clayton frowned, and Valerie instantly took his arm and said, ""What if something happens to Luna? If she dies, I won't want to live.""

Without another word, Clayton grabbed the keys and rushed out the door.

Valerie followed right behind him, but before stepping outside, she turned around and shot Audrey a smug little look‚Äîone that screamed, 'See? You lost again, Audrey. I'm the one Clayton cares about above all.'

Audrey stood by the window and watched as Clayton carried Luna to the car, and Valerie slipped into the passenger seat. To any outsider, they'd look like a perfect family.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'How ridiculous. Her own kid passed out. Instead of checking on her, that woman ran straight to Clayton.

'What if he weren't here? Would she watch her daughter die? Either Clayton's too blind to see through this pathetic act or he enjoys playing her hero.'

Zoe then left too, and the house finally went quiet. Audrey went back to the bedroom and started packing her things. She wasn't going to keep tolerating this broken marriage‚Äînot for another day.

Clayton was a lawyer. If he refused to divorce, she'd have to sue him, and she knew she'd be at a disadvantage. But she wasn't scared. It was hard, but it didn't mean it was impossible.

Back when they got married on impulse, Clayton suggested they take a year to get to know each other before becoming a ""real"" couple. Audrey agreed, but on one condition‚Äîshe'd buy her own house with her own money.

Now, she felt relieved that she made that decision. At least she still left herself a way out.

Audrey took out her suitcase and started packing her clothes and documents. Then, she opened her jewelry box on the vanity. Inside was the diamond necklace Clayton bought her. The diamond wasn't huge, but it cost over ten grand.

She'd barely worn it, afraid it looked too flashy. Now, all she could think was how stupid she'd been.

She never asked Clayton to stop giving money to his parents. During holidays, she always paid out of her own pocket to buy his parents some gifts to avoid conflict.

She didn't spend a dime of Clayton's money, yet Valerie and her kid were living off Clayton just fine.

Audrey took a deep breath, opened a drawer, and grabbed the incident report and withdrawal form from Ashwood Mental Hospital, along with the clean bill of health the doctor gave her when she was discharged.

Then she hailed a cab and went straight to the apartment she bought herself‚Äîonly to find the lock code had been changed.

Furious, she called the police. The police showed up with the building's property manager in tow.

The manager looked nervous as hell and explained, ""Mrs. Patel, Mr. Patel told us that woman and her daughter would move in.""

Audrey held up her property deed and declared, ""I'm the legal owner here. No one can move in without my permission. That's trespassing. Officer, I want the door opened under your supervision. If they damaged my place, I'm holding them and this property company accountable.""

The manager wiped the sweat from his forehead and called in a locksmith. When the door swung open, even the police and the manager looked stunned.

The house was originally done in minimalist style‚Äîwhite walls, light tiles, nothing fancy. Audrey didn't have enough budget to renovate it, but it was clean and livable.

Audrey once ordered all the furniture online. Clayton told her the dimensions were wrong and the stuff had to be returned. Thus, they didn't move in yet.

But now, they really couldn't move in.

The floor was covered with takeout boxes, trash bags, soggy delivery containers, and so on. The once-pristine walls were scribbled with markers in every color. There were dark stains everywhere‚Äîgod knows what caused them.

In the bedroom, bras and stockings were tossed all over the place. The air reeked of some cheap fruity perfume.

The plants Audrey had bought to clear out the formaldehyde were crammed onto the balcony, dried up like museum specimens.

With the police and building manager present, Audrey snapped photos of everything for evidence. Then she called a moving company. In front of everyone, she packed up all the junk, sealed it in boxes, and had it shipped off to Clayton's place in Hightower Homes.

When that was done, she asked the police for a formal incident report, changed the lock, and headed to her office to deal with her resignation procedure.

\*\*\*\*\*

At Ironhaven Medical Center, Clayton's good friend Carson Wilson pulled some strings to get Luna checked out fast.

After the exam, the doctor said, ""She had an allergic reaction that led to temporary airway obstruction. You'll need to figure out what triggered it. She got here in time, so she's currently fine. Still, don't take it lightly.""

""Thank you, doctor."" Valerie's eyes were full of tears. She clung to Clayton and said, ""Clay, I don't know what I would've done without you.""

But she noticed Clayton seemed distracted. Normally, the moment Valerie started crying, Clayton would be right there comforting her. Yet just now, when she tried to lean on him, he actually dodged a bit.

Valerie's heart dropped, and she thought, 'No. I can't let him slip away. Clayton is mine. I have to keep him mine.'

Through tears, she said, ""This is all my fault. I shouldn't have left Luna outside like that. But you know what Audrey did last time.

""Luna already has autism, and she's still scared from that scene. I didn't have a choice but to leave her in the living room.""

# Chapter 4 Audrey's Fight Back

""You know Luna is my whole world,"" Valerie sobbed, covering her face with both hands. ""Back then, I took beatings just to protect her. If anything happens to her now because of my carelessness, I won't forgive myself.""

Hearing her cry, Clayton felt a sudden wave of irritation rising in his chest.

He said, ""The doctor said she's fine. Don't beat yourself up. Honestly, getting her out of that mess is already brave. I've got stuff to deal with. You stay here and look after Luna, okay?""

A bad feeling crept up Valerie's spine. She asked cautiously, ""Are you worried Audrey will be mad? I can take Luna and leave. I swear we won't cause you any trouble.""

""You don't have to leave,"" Clayton replied, rubbing his temples. ""It's something at the firm.""

The real reason Clayton had Audrey sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital on her birthday was because she cut Valerie's hand. Valerie's reputation was just a minor cause.

He thought getting Audrey out of the picture would calm Valerie down, and then maybe she'd agree to drop the charges. If Audrey ended up with a record, she'd be blacklisted from half the job market.

Clayton had connections at Ashwood‚Äîhis law firm handled some of their legal affairs. He personally asked the manager to put Audrey in a quiet, nicer section of the hospital and told him she just needed time to cool off.

""Audrey is not the kind to hold grudges,"" Clayton added absentmindedly.

Valerie almost lost control of her expression. She opened her mouth to say more, but Clayton had already turned around and left the ward.

Carson, waiting outside the ward, walked down the stairs with Clayton. Carson said, ""Look, man, don't take this the wrong way, but Valerie's got a strange look in her eyes when she sees you.""

Clayton shot Carson a look that could freeze hell. He warned, ""Say that again, and you're not my friend anymore.""

""Alright, alright."" Carson raised his hands in surrender. ""I'm done. Just keep your eyes open. Audrey's not your match, but she's been really good to you.""

Clayton's eyes flickered, then he turned around and left the hospital. Carson stood there watching him leave and shaking his head.

None of the guys in their circles planned to get married, and they definitely hadn't supported Clayton's impulsive marriage just to spite his family for arranging an alliance for him.

But Audrey's devotion after they got married made a few of them reconsider the whole bachelor lifestyle.

When Clayton brought Valerie back into the picture and started putting her first in everything, Carson warned him not to keep Audrey in the dark.

On Audrey's birthday, Clayton had planned to finally come clean. But they were a bit late, and the accident happened.",1,1748844546.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1l1an5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brides/comments/1l1an5r/bachelorette_failed/,Bachelorette failed,"I‚Äôm really hurt and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I posted in this group before my bachelorette weekend to get advice so part of this story may seem repetitive if you saw that post.
I have a Maid of Honor & a Matron of Honor ( I was maid of honor for one of them and was supposed to maid of honor for the other before her wedding was called off). My other bridesmaids are my two sisters and my fianc√©s little sister. 

I threw bachelorette trips for both of my maid and matron of honor when it was their turn. I did everything from reservations, getting payments from bridesmaids, setting up decorations, getting Airbnbs, and getting gifts. 

Now that it‚Äôs my turn I feel disregarded and uncared for. All I asked for was one weekend of things with them two, like doing nails, threading eyebrows, getting a wax, just self care type things and maybe getting drinks. We planned for Memorial weekend, and that was the plan. I told them I didn‚Äôt need anything big and crazy how I did with theirs. Well before the sunday before that weekend my matron of honor, she told me she could only do something on Saturday because she had a Memorial Day barbecue to go to on Sunday. That hurt my feelings enough because all I had asked for was one weekend. 

Anywho on that weekend we got our nails done and since there wasnt a plan that they made, we were doing things on the spot. After our nails I went to get a wax, and I told my matron of honor I would call her when it was over. After it was offer my maid of honor decided to go home to shower and I called my matron of honor to let her know we could do something else after my maid of honor was ready. She made a comment like ‚Äúwell what are we doing, I feel like I‚Äôm just sitting at home‚Äù. After she said that I kinda just broke down and cried and told her that it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be my responsibility to have made a plan. I told her that I did so much for theirs and mine felt so last minute and unthought of. She tried apologizing but just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if that hurt your feelings‚Äù and tried to push the blame more on my maid of honor. I stopped her and said that it was more about being thoughtful to even just be generous with her time, which she didn‚Äôt do because she planned to go to some barbecue during one of the two days we were supposed to do stuff. Anyways I blew it off still upset but I didn‚Äôt want to ruin my whole weekend so I kinda just bit my tongue after that. We ended up going to dinner, which was nice but pretty awkward since they made little effort to keep conversation going (they aren‚Äôt really friends but they‚Äôve known each other for forever because they are both my childhood best friends). The next day my matron of honor went to get coffee and go to the pool with us. But it felt like she was just there to say she was there after I had gotten upset over the phone. She sat on her chair away from us most of the time because we were taking pictures, and I invited her to take some with us or at least come with us bc no one else was at the pool, and she declined. She also didn‚Äôt get in the water until the last bit of time. She didn‚Äôt want to have a drink and wanted to know how long we were going to go for because she was still going to go to the barbecue. 
She ended up sending me a whole apology text on Monday, it said ‚Äúbachelorette day‚Äù several times which annoyed me because we had talked about it being the weekend but she‚Äôs the one who made it a day. I also think that it was made with chat GPT bc there are a lot of long dashes in it. I still haven‚Äôt responded to it. 
Anywho my sisters found out about this and tried to fix it this weekend. They invited my maid of honor and my fianc√©. My fianc√© was out of town, but to my understanding my maid of honor was supposed to be there. Apparently she was even supposed to surprise pick me up this morning but I wasn‚Äôt answering my phone, so one of my sisters came to get me instead. After my sister came to get me she briefly explained that we were going to brunch and my maid of honor couldn‚Äôt get ahold of me. Sure enough when I checked my phone there was a message from her that she wanted to go to brunch at this new place. I said sorry for not answering it and that my sister was there to get me. I also asked what she would be wearing so I knew how to dress as I was getting ready. She sent a thumbs up but never saw the one about what to wear. Then when we were leaving my sister asked me to text her that we were on our way. She said she wasn‚Äôt sure what time we were going so she wasn‚Äôt ready. I kinda got the feeling she was going to flake but I thought surely not, so I said no worries if you‚Äôre late you can still come the place doesn‚Äôt close until 2 and we can wait. She then said that she wouldn‚Äôt be coming since I spent all last weekend with you I‚Äôll let you spend some alone time with your sisters let me know if y‚Äôall are doing anything after.
I immediately just broke down and cried. My maid and matron of honor have pretty much always been my only two best friends. And I felt like such a burden. Why would they ditch me, why would they both do something like this? I just said I didn‚Äôt understand why they were doing this and went to the bathroom. I talked to my mom on the phone and went back out to eat with my sisters. After we talked about something else for a bit I said that I never had responded, one of my sisters said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry I said something‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt know what she said. Later she said something like ‚Äúwell your friend probably hates me Now but I don‚Äôt really care‚Äù which is nice for standing up for me, but I hate confrontation. So all I can think about is how awkward my bridal shower is about to be and how awkward it‚Äôs going to be on the morning of getting ready. My heart just feels broken and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like it just hurts because if it were the other way around I know I would want to do anything for them to make sure they felt celebrated.

Emily's pov

He entered me slowly, the length of him burying inside me deeply.¬†

His fingertips entwine with my hair, his breath mingling with mine on my parted lips.¬†

His penetrating green eyes locked onto mine, pushing into the depths of my soul as he moved in and out of my p\*ssy.

¬†A breathy moan escaping my lips as he moved in deeper.¬†

""You feel so good Em,"" Bryson moaned on my parted mouth, his lips brushing against mine.¬†

Just as we are about to kiss a sharp buzzing sound pulls me out of my steamy dream.¬†

I woke up, my eyes wide, my chest heaving with the weight of my racing breaths, the remains of desire still lingering in my mind.

It felt so real, his touch, his kisses......the feeling of his cock pushing between my p\*ssy lips and entering me.¬†

It felt so real....

Yet, it was not.¬†

This wasn't the first time I dreamt of my best friend Bryson f\*cking my brains out. In fact, it has become a very recurring dream, one I'll admit I anticipated every night.¬†

It was the only way I could voice my true feelings, show him how much I have wanted him more than a friend.¬†

I know....it was not possible for us to ever be together.¬†

He was out of my league, and not only in feature wise but Bryson was soon to be alpha and I......was just an omega.¬†

Our two worlds could never connect in the way I wanted it to.¬†

Yet, in my dreams they do clash.¬†

I sighed heavily, twisting around and putting off the alarm clock.¬†

I groan as I fall back on my back, my eyes on the ceiling.¬†

My body was still buzzing with that ache of desire Bryson left in my dream, an ache I knew only he would be able to stop.¬†

But of course, in my reality, that wasn't possible.¬†

But in my imagination....

I closed my eyes, biting into my bottom lip harder as my fingers trail down my body, between my breasts, trailing lower.¬†

I imagine that it was not mine but his rough calloused fingers that felt good on my skin.¬†

I moaned as I imagine him whispering nasty things in my ear, his body beside me, his hands.....on my pussy.¬†

I gasp as my fingers pushed into my panties, kissing its way down to my throbbing clit.¬†

I imagine his touch, rough, yet tender. His scent. The way he'd kiss me while his fingers rub circles around my clit.¬†

The way his fingers would seek my-

""Looks like you're having fun,"" His loud voice inches from my ear made my eyes shot open.

They connected with foresty green and a crooked smile. Bryson Taylor. My best friend and future alpha of the Silver Moon pack. The one who have been haunting my restless steamy dreams at night.

He was kneeled down beside my bed so he'd be same height as me. But he still had to lean down so we could be leveled. With his elbows pushing down on my mattress, Bryson chuckled. "" Did I interrupt your little session?""¬†

His eyes twinkled with amusement when my cheeks reared an ugly red embarrassed flush. I nearly choked on my saliva.¬†

So lost in my imagination, I had not heard when he entered my room.¬†

¬†I sat up, awkwardly moving my hand out of my panties after realizing I still had them tucked in there. I notice his nose flaring as he took in a long whiff before he cleared his throat and stood up.¬†

"" How long have you been here?"" I uttered awkwardly, my face hot as I am unable to look at him.¬†

How embarrassing.¬†

Bryson let out a chuckle. ""Long enough to see that you were enjoying yourself, Em,"" He teased.

I groaned throwing the covers over y head, my mortification now worse by his playful taunting.¬†

""Please pretend like you didn't see that,"" I moaned, burning in embarrassment under the covers.¬†

I can't believe he walked in on me masturbating. Thank God I didn't moan out his name. Though I was so close to.¬†

Suddenly I felt the dip of my bed and fingers prying the sheets off my face.¬†

I peeled my eyes open and sucked in a breath with how close he was to me.¬†

Bryson smiled widely, the dimples in his cheeks going on full showcasing mode. I was breathless. Just like I always got when he smiled. Bryson was the epitome of too hot to handle.

With his green eyes, sharp jawline, dimples, straight nose, perfect brown curly hair, lean yet muscular build and tall height, it's no wonder every female wolf wanted to be his mate.

His eyes drowned into mine, almost like he was peering into my soul. It felt like I was in the dream again, only that this time, I knew it was reality.¬†

The tip of my tongue pushed out of my lips and I brushed it on my bottom lip.

His eyes flickered to my lips, the smile slipping from his mouth and replaced by a serious expression.¬†

The air suddenly feels charged, his gaze darkening and causing my breath to hitch.

""Em-

"" Breakfast is ready guys!"" My mom yelled downstairs, snapping Bryson out of his haze. He shakes his head, his eyes returning to normal as the grin returned on his mouth.¬†

""I'm sure you're starving after that little session you were having there Em. How about we head down to feed you something. I know it's not what you really want but I'm sure it can help a little."" He winked, rising to his full height.¬†

I felt my face heat up even more, the embarrassment of the situation intensifying as Bryson's teasing continued.

""Shu-u-t up,"" I stuttered. He chuckled, turning around and headed for the door. Before he was completely out, he stopped and teased over his shoulder.¬†

""Might want to put on some fresh panties."" With a light chuckle he steps out of the room, leaving me embarrassed and flushed in my room alone knowing he definitely took the scent of my arousal.¬†

# 2

Emily's pov

After I put on some fresh panties and washed my hands clean, I made my way downstairs. I found Bryson in the kitchen with a piece of bacon nearing his slightly parted mouth.

When he noticed me, he sent me a crooked grin that showcased his white teeth. ""Were you trying to finish what you started?"" He teased, pushing the bacon in his mouth.

I glared at him, my cheeks hot. He chuckled, clearly liking that he was embarrassing me further with his teasing.

I ignored him. Well tried to.¬†

I ¬†looked at my mother who was preparing breakfast. Her blonde hair similar to mine was whipped into a very high sloppy bun that was on the verge of collapsing.

""Morning momma."" I said, walking into the kitchen slowly.

She turns to look at me over her shoulder and beamed. ""Good morning Emily. Did you have a good sleep?""

""She definitely had a great morning from what I saw and heard, "" Bryson snorted under his breath. With my advanced hearing, I picked it up quickly.

I glared at the side of his face and when I do join him, I smack him behind his head while answering my mother. ""Yes I did.""

Bryson jerks forward dramatically and rubs the back of his head and hisses.

I rolled my eyes and took a seat beside him, stifling a laugh when I saw how he pouted. For being the next alpha in line, Bryson sure is dramatic.

Mom turns around with the frying pan in her hand and starts throwing some of those bacon bits on a clean plate.

""I'll be doing over time tonight Emily so I will be a bit late. You'll manage to make dinner for yourself and your dad?"" Mom asked, blowing out some of ¬†her blonde locks from her vision.

I wasn't the best chef and usually can't even cook Mac and cheese from the box properly, so it's no wonder Bryson couldn't hold himself back from snorting out a laugh.

I sent him a death stare but he only laughed even louder. Even mom joined in. It was like they were mocking me.

""I hate you two."" I grumble, reaching out for the plate mom had set the endless pieces of bacon on.

""What I meant is....I have left some overnight chicken and some rice in the fridge. All you have to do is warm it up for dinner. Can I trust you with that?"" Mom teased, turning around to place the frying pan back on the stove.

Bryson snorted. I rolled my eyes.

""Sounds super easy."" I answered through clenched teeth.

""Don't worry Mrs. Snow, I'll not have her burn your precious house down. You can count on me."" Bryson made show of placing his hand on his chest and sent me a wink that may or may not have made my heart leap.

\-

""For the love of God Bryson slow down! At this rate, we'll be dead before we even get to school."" I yelled as the wind whipped against my dirty blonde locks harshly.

Bryson spares me a glance, grins and slows down a bit.....by a bit I mean, barely.

""You need to live a little Em. We're werewolves, we won't die so easily."" He snorted, turning the steering wheel.

The sunlight that peeked from the huge branches above, treasured his face and left me in awe until he turns around to glance at me. I tore my eyes away quickly not wanting to be caught staring.

I crossed my arms over my chest and answered. ""Doesn't mean we are immortal. Besides, you're an alpha, you're practically almost immortal with those super quick healing. And I'm just an omega practically human, still heal up quick but not quick enough. "" I pointed out.

I hated mentioning how different we are. Bryson was a leader and I was at the bottom of the food chain. In fact, it was strange for an omega and alpha to be this close.

But Bryson never cared about our differences and nor did he care about the judgemental stares from the other pack members.

We got a shit tone of weird looks, especially seeing as I was known as the wolf who couldn't shift.

So why were Bryson and I practically glued by the hip? I have no clue. And I'm still trying to figure out why he even spared me a second glance that day.

\*flashback\*

You can do it, Emily, it's not that high. I reassured myself as I looked up at the monkey bars. They were high and my little skittish self backed away a little until I hit something hard.

I turned around to stare up at Giovanni. ""What? Are you a scaredy cat!?"" He sneers.

Giovanni wasn't a higher rank per se but he was ranked higher than I.

He and his friends laughed at my expense.

Since I was the lowest ranked one here and the smallest, he and his friends always picked on me.

I thought I could show them how tough I was by doing something they always mocked me I couldn't do....

But it seems that my hands cannot stop sweating and my heart won't stop beating so loudly. I was afraid of heights. Wolves were not supposed to be afraid of anything, yet I was afraid of heights.

""Yeahh!"" I heard a loud yell from a few distance away.

I turn to face the commotion. It was a boy my age, cheering on another boy my age who held a bat in his hand. They were playing cricket. And they were the higher ranked wolves.

I squinted as I watch the boy with the bat. I knew him....

I blushed brightly when he caught my eye and sent me a smile. I rip my eyes away, blushing furiously. He was the alpha's son. Bryson Taylor.

He was one of the few that didn't care about his status and mingled with the lower ranks. Many times I've seen him in the halls playing with a few lower ranks but I never got enough courage to say hello.

Suddenly, I got a boost of confidence as I still felt his eyes on me. In my stupid mind, I thought that I'd look cool to him if I did do the monkey bars.

So I did. I gathered enough courage to do it, but forced my eyes to stay ahead and not on the ground. But then Giovanni's stupid mouth had to open.

""She's shivering like a scaredy cat! Look at her!"" He laughed.

He managed to draw my attention to him and his friends.... and to the ground that seemed way higher than I thought. And now way blurrier.

I felt my fingers slip and felt the harsh cutting on my knees as I fall to the ground. I stayed down on my knees, and in quite a shock I actually fell. I couldn't cry even though I was in pain.

But then I heard his name, a yell. ""Bryson!"" And then heard the rattling of the fence as he jumped over it and raced over to me.

""Shut your mouth asshole!"" He sneered at Giovanni who had been laughing at my expense and pushed him roughly until Giovanni fell to the ground.

""Mommy!"" Giovanni cried, getting to his feet and racing out of there with tears flowing down his cheeks. His friends run after him, calling out his name.

I almost giggled because they all looked like dogs with their tails tucked between their legs.

There and then, I looked at Bryson as my hero but then when he helped me get up and dust myself while smiling down at me, I developed something I was afraid I'd never be able to stop.

Emily's pov

""You're not just an omega Em. You're special."" Bryson argued, cutting through my thoughts. His voice held a slight edge.

He always hated when I mentioned how different we both were. ""You're special to me."" He said under his breath with honesty.

My heart stops and then leaps again, this time quicker. When he said things like this my stupid heart would think that Bryson meant it in a more than friendly way.

But then the logical side of my mind would instantly throw me back a few steps or two by revealing that Bryson was only just trying to make me feel better.

Because that's what best friend's are supposed to do. Make the other one feel better.

I turned to face the window and stared at the huge endless green trees. They were so tall and their branches were thick. They wouldn't end until a few miles but would start right back again.

The sleepy town of Green Hallow....wasn't so sleepy at all.

\-

Bryson kills the engine and turns to face me, his eyes holding a gleam of mirth and his mouth a bit pouty.

I try to not stare at it for too long even though it was a temptation that I have always lost.

I keep my eyes on his nose. Because if I were to bring them to his eyes, I'd be a lost in the windows of his soul.

""Oh come on, don't tell me you're still annoyed at me?"" His lips curved into a playful grin and he chuckled.

I raised an eyebrow, and nearly rolled my eyes at his words. ""For which part exactly? Is it for teasing me the entire morning after what you saw in my room or driving like a maniac?"" I asked sarcastically.

I was trying to be as serious as I can but with Bryson, I can never truly remain angry or annoyed at him. It was just impossible.

He had that way about him that didn't allow someone to be angry with him. Or maybe it was me who just couldn't for the life of me stay mad at him for too long.

He lifts his eyes to the roof of the car and playfully made a clicking sound while shifting his head from side to side. "" For both?""

His green eyes came back to join mine, only that they were sparkling in mischief while a grin so wide and bright nearly blinded me.

They looked deep into my soul and made me shiver.

This was one of the reasons I try to avoid staring into his eyes when we were alone. I always end up feeling things I know I shouldn't be feeling.

Bryson grins.

My stomach does a slight twist and I looked away quickly.

Wanting to not have him see my skittish self I snorted out. ""Then yes, I'm a hundred percent still annoyed with you."" I unbuckled myself and opened the car door.

When I was out, I swung the bag strap over my shoulder and looked over the roof of the car when Bryson also gets out.

His eyes narrowed as the sun strikes in his eyes. It made his eyes seem gold from where I stood. "" Come on Em, you can't stay annoyed at me forever. You know you love me. "" He said with a cheesy grin.

My heart flips. If only he knew exactly how much those words were actually true. Just more than what he thought. I didn't love him only as a best friend, I loved him as more.

I breathed in through my nose and let it out through my mouth. When I am about to respond, a friend of ours joined us.

Her face shows off a huge beam, her eyes dancing when they fell on both Bryson and me.

She skips towards us, her red hair flipping behind her. She was very beautiful with her wide cocoa eyes and pretty features.

I would look like a homeless person standing beside her.

Maya throws her arm over my shoulder and hugged me. ""I missed you Em."" She squealed beside my ear.

Was it get Emily deaf day?

I wince but hugged her back while my ears rang.

Maya was the beta's daughter and would be taking the role of our future beta soon. I met her through Bryson who was already friends with her.

At first, she hadn't quite liked me and didn't want my rank to make her look bad. But then after a few greetings here and there, the conversations gradually became longer and funnier until we were practically best friends.

""You saw me yesterday."" I pointed out.

She pulls away and smacks me on the shoulder playfully. ""Still way too long to not see your chubby cute little cheeks."" She pinches my cheek to show her point.

Even though I was petite, I had chubby cheeks that made my face round. Everyone said I look adorable especially when I blush.

I smacked her hand away and glared at her playfully.

""So no one's going to even include me in the conversation?"" Bryson grumbles as he walks over to us.

I turn to give him a fake annoyed stare. ""No.""

""Ouch Em, that hurt."" He feigned a hurt look by placing his hand over his heart.

When he's beside me, Maya darts her eyes between the two of us in curiosity. ""Did something happen with you two again? Did Bryson pull a prank Em?""

Honestly, her words flew over my head the moment Bryson stepped beside me.

His body heat....

My stomach knotted and I gripped my bag strap for an anchor as I try to relax my beating heart.

With them being werewolves they'd obviously hear my quickly pounding heart. I didn't want them to question me on something I'd lie about.

And obviously, with Bryson knowing me like the back of his hand, he'd know I was lying.

Bryson throws his arm over my shoulder and is the first to respond. ""Em doesn't like fast rides, I'd make sure to remember that in the future. Apparently, my girl likes it slow. Don't you Em?"" He teased and squeezed me to him and looks down at me.

I lift my head and our eyes connected quickly.

My heart races and I'm not sure I can actually hide the fact that I'm getting flushed.

My girl...

Bryson's tone was heavy with a tease, but there was something in his eyes while he stares at me that made my heart leap.

# 4

Emily's pov

I sat down on one of the chairs around the lunch table and dug into my burger. I was hungry and moaned aloud.

""Don't make that sound again Em,"" Bryson grunted a bit when he sat down on one of the chairs beside mine.

I furrow my brows and turn to him.

His eyes fall to my lips and they darken. I'm stunned by how dark they've become. ""You have something on the corner of your..."" He trails off and before I can wipe whatever was on my lips, Bryson reached out and brushed his finger on the corner of my mouth.

My eyes fall to his finger and I feel the heat crawl up my neck and settle in my cheeks when I noticed that the tip of his finger was painted with mayo.

With a smirk, Bryson lifted his finger and pushed it in his mouth and, sucked. He moaned.

And my heart leaped.

When he was done, he grinned at me and teased. ""You're such a messy eater.""

This time the heat took over my entire face. I was certain I looked so red that everyone could spot me from afar.

Bryson chuckled and was about to say something when someone else plopped down on the chair mirroring mine.

""What are you two talking about?"" Shawn, Bryson's best friend and also a close friend of mine asked as he dug into his fries.

His eyes gleamed with amusement as they darted between Bryson and I.

He arrowed a fry our way. ""Let me guess. You two are flirting like usual.""

If it were even possible my face turned even redder. ""We we-re not flir-ting."" I splattered out.

Shawn busted out laughing at my expense and from the corner of my eye I can see Bryson staring at me with a huge grin on his face.

Great my friends thought I was a laughing stock.

""Bryce. Did you see how red she got man?! Em is literally the color of a firetruck."" Shawn snorted playfully.

I glared at both him and Bryson whose grin widened as he agreed. ""Yes. Makes me wonder where else that blush go."" There's a heavy tone in Bryson's voice that had a slick electrical feeling zapping down my spine.

""Yuck. Keep the flirting away from me before I barf."" Shawn jokes and had me shyly moving my eyes away from both his and Bryson's.

""Who's flirting?"" Maya's voice flutters near.

I turn around to see one of her arms slung over Bryson's shoulder as she held him close.

Everyone knew that if anyone had to be Bryson's fated mate, then it would be Maya.

Not only was she of higher rank but she was beautiful and walked with grace.

Bryson deserved a mate as strong as him.

And that mate couldn't be me, because I was weak. An omega and not as pretty as Maya.

Swimming with jealousy, I tore my eyes away from the two.

Shawn who didn't always see eye to eye with Maya, responded sarcastically. ""Bryson and Emily. Who else? Do you see any other couple around Maya?""

I shyly peeked at Bryson when Shawn mentioned that we were a couple. He didn't look like he hated it, in fact, Bryson had a charming grin on his face.

Maya removed her arm off Bryson's shoulders and glared at Shawn. ""Would it kill you to be nice to me for once dick? And, besides, Bryson and Em aren't a couple. Bryson's going to find his mate soon so you should be careful with your words. His mate might be someone in this room, you never know.""

She huffed and went to sit down on the chair beside Shawn who scooted away from her a little.

I looked over at Bryson. That grin on his face is gone and is replaced by a frown.

""What does finding his mate have to do with this now? There's no harm in the two flirting."" Shawn grumbles and glared at Maya.

""I'm just saying that if his mate is in the room she might get the wrong idea. It could be anyone, well except for Emily herself. She's an omega so her being Bryson's mate isn't believable."" Maya said with a shrug.

There was a bitter feeling in my chest when she said those words. And even though they were absolutely true, it didn't make it hurt any less.

Suddenly a chair scraps backward and I snap my gaze to Bryson who stands up and storms away, leaving the three of us stunned by his sudden departure.

""What's wrong with him?"" Maya asked in confusion as she stared at a storming away Bryson who managed to capture everyone's attention.

""Gee I wonder who upset him,"" Shawn said sarcastically.

I rise to my feet, concerned about his obvious angry mood. ""I'll go check up on him,"" I said.

""No, I'll go,"" Maya said and rose to her feet. Shawn is quick to wrap his hand around her wrist and stops her.

""No, Emily should go. It's obvious you upset him with your words Maya. I don't think you going to him is a good idea. Let Emily handle it."" He grumbles tightly.

Maya frowns but nods and sat back down.

Shawn nods his head, urging me to go ahead. I quickly leave the cafeteria my eyes scanning around the area.

Where could you be Bryce....

I opened the locker room and sure enough, there was the sound of a fist hitting metal.

I rush over to his side, shocked to see him this angry. He's breathing roughly and his canines are out. And when he looked at me, I stare into angry red eyes.

He's shifting and he's trying to fight it.

""Bryce,"" I said softly as I took a cautious step forward. Bryce was an alpha, a future alpha and they tend to not be able to control their emotions when the day to take over the pack is approaching.

He places his forehead on the locker while trying to control his rage and breathing.

I approached him slowly, cautiously and when I'm beside him, I reach out and place my hand on his shoulder.

He relaxes, breathing out a sigh.

""Did she upset you that much Bryce?"" I whispered when his eyes had gone back to normal and his teeth retracted.

""It's her damn words. I hate when she brings up the mate thing."" He admits and pushes off the locker only to turn around to face me.

""I don't understand,"" I whispered. ""She's right you know, you'll be finding your mate soon. Isn't that a good thing?""

Bryson's jaw ticked and his eyes shifted in irritation. ""How is that a good thing if there's a possibility I can't have the girl I want Em?""

Emily's pov

His words stunned me and my heart leaped.

Did he have someone in mind he wanted as his mate?

It sure sounded as though he had someone he liked.

My heart throbbed.

I know I shouldn't feel this way, Bryson after all would obviously be attracted to girls...

A big part of me wanted him to be attracted to me but that was just wishful thinking.

Bryson was way out of my league, in looks and ranking.

It's actually laughable that I was so deeply in love with an alpha male who would never be mated to an omega like me.

Bryson sighs and rakes a hand through his hair. ""The closer my birthday comes the more agitated I get. I'm fearful of who I'll end up with¬† knowing that the one I really want might not-

He groans and shakes his head. His eyes lift to mine and they connected. It feels like electricity is zapping around us as he holds me in an intense stare.

""In a few months, you'll be turning eighteen to Em. Aren't you afraid of who you'll end up with?"" He asked, staring at me deeply.

I tore my eyes away from him.

I've thought about who the moon goddess must've chosen for me and my mind always wraps back to maybe an omega or low-ranked male.

Omegas have never been mated to any higher-ranked wolves, it's not like I'd magically be mated to one now.

""I've thought about it a lot actually. And yes I'm terrified of that day."" I admitted.

I'm terrified that we won't have the same bond we have now.

Your main focus will be on your Luna and I'll be stuck with someone I have to force to fall in love with even though my heart belongs to you.

But instead of saying the truth, I sent him a shaky smile. ""But I figured the moon goddess won't fate me to a higher ranked wolf so I suppose I have nothing to fear of. You know how you higher ranked wolves are more maintenance."" I joked trying to ease the tension.

But it does the opposite because Bryson's brows knot into a frown and he grumbles. ""Right.""

He stares at me with an emotion he was quick to mask and then clears his throat. ""I guess we'll just have to wait and see who we end up with huh?""

I nodded grimly.

I didn't want to end up with anyone else other than Bryson. I was in love with him and I was afraid that even with a mate that's not him, I'd never be able to get over him.

\_

""You better take your time today,"" I warned him as I buckled myself.

Bryson shoots me a grin and winks. ""No promises.""

I gripped the door quickly as he drove off.

""Bryson Taylor!"" I yelled in anger.

He roared with laughter and then slowed down. I turn to shoot him a glare.

""I swear you're just trying to piss me off.""

The corner of his mouth lifted into a smirk as he spared me a glance. ""You're hot when you're pissed off, I can't help it."" He joked but there was something weighing in his tone that made it a bit hoarse.

Again, his words always seem to make me stop breathing for a few. But then I always remember that Bryson was always a teaser and he loved to tease me. Those words had no real meaning behind them. They were just that, words.

Even though I wanted them to mean so much more.

With a raging blush on my face that I failed to hide, I rip my eyes away from him and focus on the road while I murmur. ""Shut up. ""

He chuckles and the sound sent a warm rush of tingles fluttering in my stomach.

When we got to my place Bryson said he'd much rather warm up the food in fear that I'd 'burn' down the house.

""Whatever,"" I said and rolled my eyes.

I left him and went upstairs to freshen up.

When I got back upstairs, Bryson is already seated on the sofa, his feet kicked up on the coffee table.

""Aren't you supposed to have a meeting with your dad today about the alpha ceremony?"" I asked as I approached him.

Not only was Bryson turning the age of eighteen in a couple of days, but he would also be passed down the alpha title. He will now be the alpha leader of the pack.

Something he's been training for relentlessly.

He looks up at me and I didn't fail to notice the way his eyes dipped for a few seconds on my breasts area and legs.

I blushed and he clears his throat while reaching over for the remote. ""Like I'd leave you home alone Em. I mind linked my dad, we'll talk about it tomorrow.""

I winced.

Brent Taylor, alpha of our pack, was a bit more stern. Especially when it came to pack business.

""Was he upset?"" I winced as I plopped beside him.

I let out a tiny breath when his arm slings around my shoulder and he pulled me closer to his side.

""Nah not really. He understood. It's really not a big deal Em. Alpha duties can come after, you'll always come first.""

I swallowed the lump in my throat. When he says words like that it makes me want to beg him to kiss me at least once before he'll never be mine again.

But that wasn't a possibility. We were best friends and he only saw me as his little sister.

""I just don't want to be the reason you're missing out on your duties Bryce. You'll take over the pack in literally a few days. "" I whispered and peeked at him under my lashes.

I hear his sharp intake of breath when our eyes connected and furrow my brows when he rips them away quickly.

""I have enough time Em. Now stop being so worried."" He whispered and switched through the movies and picked one I liked even though he didn't like that kind of genre.

I smiled and lay my head on his shoulder.

\-

A few hours had passed and now it was dark out. The only light in the house was coming from the television.

We had eaten a few hours ago and now I was exhausted.

I yawned, my eyes fluttering closed until sleep washed over me. It was only when I felt myself being lifted did my eyes slowly fluttered open.

In my hazy mind and vision, I spotted Bryson's eyes staring down at me. ""Go back to sleep Em, I got you."" He whispered and my eyes followed his command.

I can hear his footfalls as he walked up the stairs, feel his arms hold me protectively to his chest. Hear the steady beating of his heart in his chest.

And then soon, I felt the soft covers under me as I sank into the mattress. He fixed me and pulled the covers over my legs to my midsection.

But when I thought he was gone, I felt the hovering presence of him above me then felt the softness of his lips on the corner of my mouth.

""Goodnight baby."" He whispered, his lips lingering there.

# 6

Emily's pov

""Bryson, what are you doing here?"" I whispered, looking into his startling green eyes that shone with love.

I must be dreaming. Why was he staring at me with so much love?¬†

Bryson takes a step forward, his eyes darkening with lust when they fall to my parted mouth.

I let out a gasp of air from the intensity of the fire of desire swirling in his foresty gaze.

His eyes cause my body to burn with heat and I bit my bottom lip to stop myself from moaning out loud.

I'm like a flickering match under the weight of his stare and when he spoke in a husky tone next, I burn alive.

""Em, I want you,"" He groaned, his eyes darkening until they swirled with red.

His wolf was aroused too.

It wasn't only him.

""I've wanted you for so long. I want you Em. I want you so badly it hurts."" His hands reach up and he bunches his shirt in his hand. Where his heart beat.

I can hear it. I can hear the organ beat as furiously as mine.

I sucked a very sharp breath, stumbling back a step when his words registered.

He wants me.

His canines jut out from his gum and he takes a powerful step forward.

¬†""I want you and I'm going to claim you. I'm claiming you as mine Em. You're mine."" He snarls and finishes the distance between us and pulls me in his arms.

He holds the back of my head, forcing me to look up. Our eyes connected and tingles rake over my body and swirl in my veins like the fire he had flickered already inside me.

""Bry-son,"" I gasped, my eyes widening a little.

He grins, showcasing his canines that were still on display. ""I knew it. I knew you were mine. You're my luna-

I gasped, my upper half snapping up in a sitting position. I gripped the covers around my body as I try to relax my pounding heart.

I'm trembling and lift my hand to brush through my hair shakily.

Great Em, now you're dreaming of your best friend claiming you....

You can't be any more obsessed than this.

I let out a shaky breath and licked across my lower lip which felt dry.

Pang.

My brows furrowed.

Pang.

What the hell?

Another pang cracks the silence in the room.

I look over at my window. There wasn't a tree or a branch close by that can make that kind of sound.

The only person or should I say wolf who would do this was none other than my best friend. The boy I just dreamt about.

Pang.

I was right. He was throwing tiny stones at my window.

My heart starts beating like it normally does when he's near.

I gripped my shirt where my heart beat in my chest.

Calm down, heart. Stop making it obvious.

When the organ had finally settled, I throw the covers off my body and padded my way over to the window.

I slid it open, welcoming the cold air to beat against my cheeks.

I looked down and sure enough, Bryson is standing just under my window, his arm up ready to sling another pebble at the glass.

I stop him before he could.

""Bryson!"" I hissed getting his attention. He stops, throws the pebble down, and grins up at me.

""You caught me. I will forever be indebted to you, my lady."" He joked, keeping his hands up in surrender.

I rolled my eyes yet smiled. I had noted that he had no shirt on and only khaki shorts.

He had been in wolf form and run all the way here.

I turn to look at the beating red numbers on my nightstand clock. It's two a.m in the morning.

That's the latest he had ever come here.

I furrowed my brows in confusion.¬† ""What's wrong Bryce?"" I whispered in a worried tone that he caught.

""Jump,"" He answered.

I shook my head. ""It's cold out, and it's inappropriate to be outside at this hour with my future alpha.""

He knew I was bullshitting him. Even if I had yet to shift I still had wolf genes which made my body warm even in the winter times. It was difficult to get cold.

After that dream I just had, I didn't want to be face to face with him so close.

Bryson looks irritated and moves out of the shadows a bit. The fadish light from the moon beamed down on him, eliminating his green foresty eyes.

""And as your future alpha, I ask that you get your pretty ass down here this instant."" He cocked a challenging brow. ""Or would you rather I come up there and take you myself?""

Oh damn, he was serious.

Sighing in defeat, I opened the window wider and crawled onto the ledge. I looked down, pinning him with a look that told him he better catch me.

He grins boyishly and winks. ""I'll always catch you Em. "" He promises, his eyes shining with honesty.

If I fell I wouldn't necessarily die. It wasn't that high off the ground and I could still heal. Slowly yes, but I'd heal nonetheless.

But that didn't mean I'd take the chance to actually fall and perhaps accidentally break a bone or two in the process.

I held the air in my lungs, counted to three, and jumped.

""Oomph,"" I said when arms quickly wrap around me, catching me before I could land on the ground.

Bryson's arms wrapped around me like a band of hard steel, tightening around me protectively.

For a few moments, we stay like this, just me in his arms and him holding me so closely.

I slowly looked up at him, only to remember that his upper half was naked.

A furious blush spread on my cheeks hotly and I squirm and wiggle for him to put me down on my feet.

""Okay you can put me down now,"" I said, avoiding his gaze and very thankful that¬† I left my hair down messily, so it would help to veil around my face and block his sight from my reddened cheeks.

""Oh right,"" Bryson said sheepishly and awkwardly place me on my feet.

I fixed my oversized shirt and brushed my hair in a way that would block my cheeks.

Looking up at him, he's already staring at me in amusement.

""Now can you tell me why you're here so late?"" I asked, trying to move his attention away from me.

In the third year of marriage,a female college student,Afro Cartier,came to my door and shouted,""So this is the old woman who seduced Hyes!""

The woman grabbed my phone and threw it to the¬†[ground.In](http://ground.in/)¬†the next moment,a group of female college students swarmed over and held me down.""Strip her clothes off and throw her into the yard,see if she knows shame.""

I screamed with all my strength and finally curled up on the ground.I let them punch and kicked me.

When Afro came back,I was kneeling in front of the mistress in embarrassment.She just frowned and helped me up,""The girls were jealous and they have bad tempers when they are bothered,so don't mess up with them.""

I raised my head,""Why should I bother them?""

Afro sneered immediately,""Then you should try it.""

Watching their backs hugging and leaving,I turned around and called the police.""Hey,I want to report a crime located in 10-meter suburbs of California.Someone broke into the house and beat me!""

‚Äî‚Äî

I went to the hospital to check my condition and got the injury report.Afro and her friends were taken to the police station.

I rejected the doctor's suggestion of intravenous infusion and took the medicine home.I held the pill in my mouth and the bitterness just spread on the tip of my tongue.

When Richard Hyes came back,he walked up to me and glanced at me,""You‚Äôre six years older than Afro,how can you be so ignorant?Don't you care about the face of our families?Go to the police station and withdraw the case.""

He handed over a paper,""You don't want your father-in-law's scandal to be on the headlines tomorrow,do you?If your mother-in-law knows,she will go crazy again.""

I flipped through the photos and documents handed over by the man and my eyes sank.

My father had always been bearish and the women he had slept with could be so much trouble.

After a provocation at home,my mother was pushed down the stairs and lost her eight-month-old son in her belly.

My mother had not had a miscarriage yet and the fact that my father's mistress gave birth to a son hit her so hard.She became mentally [broken.How](http://broken.How) could she not when she borne such a blow?

The poor man who supported her wholeheartedly betrayed not only the vows of love,but also her beliefs.

That year,I was ten years old.I watched my father move into the house with his¬†[mistress.My](http://mistress.my/)¬†mother cried all day long,half sober and half obscured.

At that time,I didn't understand why my mother didn't divorce.When I was eighteen years old,my mother gave me 50%of the company's shares when she was sober.

I realized that I couldn't protect the tens of billions of assets at the age of ten and my mother couldn't protect them either.She could only rely on the affection between her and my father when she was young to protect me as I grew up.

While my heart was broken,I consumed my spirit to heal¬†[myself.My](http://myself.my/)¬†heart was stung by the sting of a wasp's tail.

I looked at Richard with a stern look,""Richard,is she so important?Why do you treat me like this?""

At that moment,I raised my head and let my tears flow into my chest.

My mother's tears told me that tearing in front of someone who didn't love you would only be cheaper than tap water.

Richard looked at me,""Quinni,I always thought you were a smart person.She won't threaten your position as [Mrs.Hyes.At](http://Mrs.Hyes.At) most,she maybe a little bit aggressive,but you don‚Äôt have to be doing the same,do you?""

I looked at Richard and smiled bitterly.

At this moment,I finally saw the attentive side of Richard,but his heart was only for his mistress.

""Richard,you promised me that you would not do dirty things and would not look for any other women.I married you because you have good self-control and a clean private [life.Now](http://life.Now) you are threatening me with your dad?""

He knew how much I hated men protecting mistresses,but he still didn't care.

Chapter 2

He really didn't care about me at all.Richard was silent for a moment.

He said,""This time it was just an accident.I will never look for a woman again.Don't touch Afro.She‚Äôs innocent.I will give you everything you want in the future,except feelings.""

I was stunned and my ears were like thunder.He was not unchaste,but he had not met someone worthy.

At that time,he had met his true love,so he would do whatever it took and lost his principles.

Three years of marriage,after all,I was wrong.After thinking for a night,I withdrew the case.

My half-brother became the general manager of the company.I,the deputy general manager,was nominally half a level higher than him,but my father had already begun to train him to take over various activities of the company.

I couldn't act on impulse.Lawrence was built by my grandfather and my mother had given away half of it.I had to keep his hard work.

At night,Richard did not come back and I received a video sent by Afro.

Under the dim light,Richard held his wrist and put down his latest Patek Philippe,with a doting and affectionate look in his eyes.

""Little rascal,don't mess around anymore.What if I hurt you?I'll feel [bad.No](http://bad.No) matter what happens,just leave it to me.""

Listening to Richard's low and soft voice,a feeling of suffocation came over me.

""Richard,I broke into your house and beat her up on purpose.I just wanted you to see the truth.Who do you really love?""

""After all,even I mentioned that I beat her up,I know that you will protect me and settle it for [me.You](http://me.You) should be smart and take the initiative to divorce so you can get out of the Hyes Family.""

The person on the other side was arrogant and complacent.

I had already prepared myself mentally,thinking that I had more a support.However,when I heard Afro's declaration,I couldn't stop the pain in my heart.

I picked up the strong liquor in front of me and drank it in one gulp.Since I entered Lawrence's at the age of 18,in order to gain a foothold,I drank ten glasses of brandy and a bottle of Lafite at a time.

I was hospitalized for three days due to gastric bleeding.After being discharged from the hospital,I still drank with a group of men.

Since I married Richard,he didn‚Äôt let me drink wine and said,""Drinking is a man's thing.I will drink it from now on.""

At that moment,I had expectations for business marriage.Perhaps,the husband chosen by my father for me would be my lifelong support.I also knew that he was a decent person with good self-control and behavior.He should not be a womanizer.

Tears mixed with strong liquor went down my throat and the burning heart hurt even¬†[more.In](http://more.in/)¬†a trance,I pulled a man next to me and angrily questioned him,""Why?Why do you bully me like this?""

That day,I held him tightly and refused to let go.When I woke up again,I was lying on the big bed in my only small clothes and there was a sound of running water in the bathroom.

The tall figure was cast on the frosted glass and when I was going to move,my lower body was slightly¬†[painful.My](http://painful.my/)¬†heart trembled and I quickly bent down to pick up the clothes and put them on.

I walked towards the door with my back hunched.While I was walking to the door,I paused,took out a stack of money and put it on the coffee table.I left the room decisively.

Just as I let out a sigh of relief,my father called me,""Tomorrow is your aunt,Luna's 50th birthday.I need to discuss something with Richard.Ask him to go home.""

I thought for a moment and called Richard.There was a burst of laughter from the other side,""Husband,I want you to feed me!Is it that the old woman?""

Richard's low laugh came,""Be nice,just one minute.""

I took a deep breath and pretended not to hear,""Richard,go back to the old house tomorrow.It's Luna's birthday and dad asked you to go home.""

Chapter 3

The sound on other side hummed,""I will prepare a gift and pick you up at six o'clock tomorrow night.""

After that,the phone was hung up with a snap.I could imagine the scene of Afro pestering Richard to feed her with a sweet smile.

Looking at the bruise on my arm,I suddenly felt a sense of revenge.I sighed dejectedly after a moment.

The next day,I prepared everything and put on light makeup to improve my [complexion.At](http://complexion.At) six o'clock,Richard was nowhere to be seen and could not reach.

After several times,I left her a message and went over first.I brought the gifts to the old house and found that the guests were all there.

Seeing that I was alone,my father said dissatisfiedly,""Where is my son-in-law?So many guests are here,why don't you come with him?""

Luna Ortish glanced at me lightly,""Ronald,don't embarrass Quinni.With her stubborn personality,it's normal that your son-in-law doesn't like to come with her.""She raised her wrist unconsciously,revealing the eight-treasure imperial green bracelet.

I couldn't help but shrink my eyes.That was my mother's dowry and it was custom-made by my grandfather from a foreign master.

My father showed a little impatience,""Call him and make sure he‚Äôs coming.""

I lowered my eyebrows and head,as I was about to perfunctorily pass it over.The next second,there was a noise outside the door.I looked up and saw Richard in a white suit and red bow tie at the door.

Meanwhile,Afro Cartier,who was next to him,was wearing a white dress.

If someone didn‚Äôt know him,they would most probably think that this was his wedding day.

My heart tightened.That day was the Lawrence Family's banquet and he actually brought Afro to the door.This was openly trampling on my face.Someone nearby started to whisper.

""Boss Hyes turns to bring his young mistress to his father-in-law's house,what a fantastic night!""

""Who let him be the richest man?When the Lawrence Family tried to lift him up after they sold their daughter,they should have thought about the result today.""

""What‚Äôs on earth!It's very pitiful Miss Lawrence.She‚Äôs so proud and capable,but now look what happen?She becomes an abandoned woman.""

I watched Richard walking to my father with Afro.""Dad,this is my friend,Afro Cartier.She‚Äôs bored alone at home,so I brought her here to get some fun.""

My father's face froze and he smiled,""Afro Cartier,welcome,welcome,Richard's friends are friends of mine,please take a seat.""

Afro glanced at me with her eyes rolling,""Since you welcome me,I won't be naughty.""

Seeing Richard chuckle and look at Afro,my nose suddenly felt¬†[sore.My](http://sore.my/)¬†heart seemed to be pinched by a pair of big hands and ravaged.

In the next moment,my father led Richard to meet Luna.Richard handed over the gift with a smile,wishing her health and happiness.

My father and him sat side by side in the middle of the podium,accepting everyone's congratulations.Only then did I realize that my mother had also been taken back from the sanatorium.She actually stood below Luna.

Everyone called Luna Mrs.Lawrence and just nodded to my¬†[mother.In](http://mother.in/)¬†contrary,my mother only laughed,mechanically turned the jade bracelet on her wrist.She immersed herself in her own world.

It was a token of love that my father gave her when he confessed his love,a man-made glass bead bracelet worth twenty billion dollar.

I walked over her in distressed and hugged my mother.I arranged her hair.Everyone passed by us,toasting and laughing.They chatted with Richard,praising Afro's elegant temperament.

The rich ladies surrounded Luna,envious of her marrying a good husband and taking better care of herself.

In the intertwined banquet hall,my mother and I were like lonely fallen leaves,letting people wave away at will.

Chapter 4

I couldn't bear to embarrass my mother,so I helped her to the room to rest.I saw that the master bedroom had been replaced with Luna's things.

The revealing lace nightgown,the head-to-head photos of her and her father filled the room.I held back my sadness and helped my mother into the guest room.Let her lie down and rest for a while.

She smiled at me and said,""Quinni is so good.""

When I returned to the banquet hall,I found that Richard was gone.I turned around and suddenly heard a familiar voice in the shadows of the courtyard,""Richard,you openly brought Afro to the Lawrence Family banquet.Aren't you afraid that your wife be angry and turn against you?""

""Last time,Afro brought people to beat your [wife.You](http://wife.You) are spoiling her too much.""

I paused and moved towards the dark.There was a lot of noise all around,but Richard's deep voice still came through clearly,""Afro is my life.We have a different kind of relationship and I am spoiling her.""

""What kind of relationship do you have with her?Isn't it just a few times of sleeping together?""

""You don't understand,she saved me when she was ten years old.I promised her to marry her.""

My friend was stunned for a moment,""So,the girl that saved you when you were kidnapped as a child is her?You even gave her the amulet,but I didn't expect that your benefactor was Afro.""

Richard hummed softly,followed by a long silence.It was like a thunder in my mind.I looked at Richard's figure in the dark in shock.It turned out to be him,it was him.

Richard walked out of the shadows and I quickly turned and entered the hall.I stepped into the hall and my pupils suddenly dilated when I looked up.

I saw two servants holding my mother down and kneeling in front of¬†[Luna.My](http://luna.my/)¬†mother struggled and shouted,""My pocket watch,that was given to me by my father!""

Luna held up the pocket watch frivolously and the silver watch chain hung on her face.""Isn't it just a broken watch,then how could you grab me?Husband,look at the back of my hand,I just spent two hours maintaining it.""

My father looked at my mother with disgust,""Why are you becoming more and more ignorant?It's Luna's 50th birthday.It's rare that she likes a watch like this.What's wrong with you cannot give it to her to play with?""

A surge of anger surged me up.I strode over and pushed the two servants away,""Take your dirty hands and let go of my mother.""

I snatched my mother's pocket watch,put it in her hand and hugged her tightly,""Mom,it's okay.It's okay.No one will take your watch.""

My mother hugged the pocket watch tightly to her heart as she was sobbing.Meanwhile,my tears couldn't help [falling.It](http://falling.It) dropped little by little on my arm.

My mother wiped my tears in panic,""Don't cry,my dear.""

My father's face darkened and he slapped me on the head,""You rebellious girl,why don't you give the watch to Luna?She has worked hard for our family for 20 years and you treat her like this?""

I stumbled back and saw Richard walking into the hall.Suddenly,there was a scream behind me,""Ah,Richard,save me!""

I steadied myself and saw that Afro was rolling down the stairs.Just then,she was standing behind me,but I didn't touch her at all.Richard's face suddenly changed and he ran over and picked up Afro.

""Richard,don't blame her.She will be fine once she vents her anger.""Afro looked pale and timidly at me.Richard picked her up in distress,looking at me coldly.

He said in decisive tone,""Quinni Lawrence,am I too tolerant to you,you dare to attack Afro?""

I was hoarse and helpless to defend,""Richard,I didn't.""

""Enough,I saw it with my own eyes,but you still don't admit it?""

""If you hadn't humiliated Afro last time,how could Afro run to our house to beat [you.You](http://you.You) even bit back and called the police.Quinni,why are you so cruel now?""

I stared at Richard [blankly.It](http://blankly.It) turned out that it was my fault to be¬†[beaten.In](http://beaten.in/)¬†his heart,although I said a hundred words,it wouldn‚Äôt comparable to Afro's one word.

My silence fell into Richard's eyes as guilty acquiescence.His pupils slowly shrank and a fierce look flashed on his face.

""Security,lock my wife in the basement.Without my order,you are not allowed to let her out.""

The security held my arms with their mountain-like bodies,but I struggled¬†[furiously.My](http://furiously.my/)¬†father stepped forward and advised,""Richard,Quinni was just out of control for a moment,you...""

Richard coldly spoke,""Dad,Quinni is now Hyes Family.You can trust this matter to me.All you have to do is just to focus on your new project.You don't need to worry about her.""

After he said that,he walked out with Afro in his arms.Afro turned her head and looked at me in disdain and mockery.

All the guests whispered,""Afro Cartier is Mr.Hyes'Achilles'heel.You should be polite when you meet her in the future.""

""That's right,Mr.Hyes used to be very nice to Mrs.Hyes,but he didn't expect to meet Afro Cartier and be so mean to her to lock her in the basement.""

The security held me out,while my mother was pulling my feet.She cried heartbreakingly,""Don't take Quinni away,my Quinni...""

The servants surrounded my mother and pressed her¬†[down.My](http://down.my/)¬†tears flowed down.Through my tearful eyes,I saw my mother lying on the ground.I couldn't hold back any more and cried out,""Mom!""

I‚Äôm not complaining or saying anything bad about this btw. Like obviously anyone can be there !

I‚Äôm just genuinely curious because we started to see like a lot of middle eastern folks populating mosaic a lot recently and was curious about if there‚Äôs some kind of function. 

I remember I used to see some car people, basically just any spoiled teen with a modded bmw or some with loud Toyotas lol. Didn‚Äôt really care or mind much, except for those few cars that would endlessly blow up their exhausts. 

We‚Äôve noticed it slowly transitioned from being a car kids hotspot, to some of those middle eastern dudes with expensive cars would show up for the car meets. To now seeing full on middle eastern families hanging out there by heaps anywhere past 6pm till 11. 

One of my brown friends was thinking /guessing that the coffee shop might be owned by a middle eastern family and maybe that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs lots of them coming out to support. But I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs it since the sign for the coffee shop says its own by dolcezza ?  

I thought it could be a Ramadan type of thing where Muslim folks/families would go out to eat late at night due to their religious beliefs.

I ordered an Iced Lavender Latte as well. I didn't taste the lavender. However, the coffee itself was so-so; I wouldn't grab coffee from here on my way to work or anything but on the flip side, I noticed that most of the drinks on the menu were pretty low in calories ranging from 150cal to 350 cal. They also offered vegan options or dairy substitutes. They have some pretty interesting drinks. I would like to revisit just to try their Matcha Lavender Lemonade.



I didn't like that guest must open the pastry container and get their own treats. It's a bit unsanitary. Furthermore, the restrooms were out of toilet paper and tissue was on the ground. All of the trash cans in the cafe were overfilled. There were forks but no butter-knives; as a result, struggled to enjoy my pastry without getting food under my nails. The dining area wasn't clean and I noticed that guests were not washing their hands prior to opening the pastry counter; by the end of my experience, there were finger prints all over the glass.



When I arrived, there weren't many guest but once I began eating, a rush of people came into the cafe. However, there was a line of three people when I first got there.

This is reflected throughout the series in various ways, for example, I think that seeing people like Razor as a person and trusting him is a risk. People don‚Äôt trust each other, because it always seems like the safer route. But my focus is not Razor, nor Binolt, nor even Killua. 

[It‚Äôs (mostly) about Pakunoda, of course.](https://i.imgur.com/Zmx3myo.png) 

And Kurapika and a bit of Gon, and generally just a part of why Yorknew is an incredible arc. 

---

When considering the fortunes, I‚Äôm convinced that it is Paku‚Äôs choice that made it so that Chrollo‚Äôs capture was only an afternoon coffee break for Chrollo.

I don‚Äôt think Chrollo was inherently right, [either about the Spiders, nor about Kurapika](https://i.imgur.com/S2zgKN7.png) (more on that later). The Spider didn‚Äôt need its head, or so Kurapika believed, and getting rid of Chrollo wouldn‚Äôt achieve his goals.

Yet Paku showed up completely unguarded, taking that gamble, staking her life on this (not unlike Pitou making herself vulnerable before Gon). And like Gon, it‚Äôs a large part of what Kurapika struggled to face when confronting the enemy, and for Kurapika, it changed everything. Things could have gone differently had Paku not shown up fully *trusting in the enemy* ‚Äì Phinks‚Äô suspicion was legitimate. Not only could Kurapika have set Judgement Chain on Chrollo with more conditions while Paku wasn‚Äôt there, he could have watched Paku‚Äôs airship leave, then turn back around and kill Chrollo. But he didn‚Äôt. [He chose not to, knowing the risk of removal.](https://i.imgur.com/RqeFdGP.png) 

I said that I don‚Äôt believe Chrollo was right about Kurapika, despite it playing out exactly as he said: that he ended up choosing his friends over killing Chrollo for vengeance. But as we see with Gon ‚Äì he [pointed out what he believes about Kurapika‚Äôs abilities,](https://i.imgur.com/W8NaE1l.png) while [Killua contradicts him.](https://i.imgur.com/uZfHWHS.png) Gon wasn‚Äôt right *at first,* but [the experiences they shared made it so.](https://i.imgur.com/SRsleU8.png) What I mean about Chrollo not inherently being right is that the choices mattered. The characters‚Äô lives, actions, and who they become are not set in stone.   

What I take from Gon‚Äôs view of Kurapika is that, when he insisted [‚ÄúKurapika isn‚Äôt that type of person‚Äù](https://i.imgur.com/P1Bb4Lt.png), we know this isn‚Äôt necessarily true; he wasn‚Äôt there when Kurapika fought Uvo, he didn‚Äôt see this side of Kurapika. But Gon has faith in him, like he did in Killua back when he had no idea that [Killua was losing his temper and tearing up some guys just for pissing him off.](https://i.imgur.com/Nd0OpE0.png)

In Hunter x Hunter, almost no one is truly static. People can change at any time. Believing in someone doesn‚Äôt mean that they were always ‚Äúgood‚Äù to start with, but it means that there is potential for that good (and ill of course).

Whether it‚Äôs Pakunoda asking her friends to accept her gunshots in the midst of their conflict, or showing up and [trusting in her enemy completely,](https://i.imgur.com/UQXM0Q2.png) and in doing so, influencing that enemy‚Äôs actions and ensuring the safety of her friend.

So, I‚Äôm not here to drop a ‚Äúhey wyd‚Äù and vanish after 3 texts‚ÄîI‚Äôm actually looking for a real long-term connection. Something easy, genuine, fun, maybe even deep sometimes. Y‚Äôknow‚Ä¶ something that feels good to come back to after a long day.

I‚Äôm 19. Into classic movies (yes, I love The Good, The Bad and The Ugly), emotional story games that destroy you in the best way, writing poetry and short stories when I get in my head a little too much.
Also big on books, learning languages (currently on Japanese and German), and just exploring new cultures in general.

I‚Äôm more of a mountain-and-coffee than club-and-shot type of guy. Solo travel? Big yes. Quiet sunrises? Even bigger yes.
Work-wise, life‚Äôs kinda wild‚ÄîI run a marketing agency, work with an American company, and manage an NGO and school for kids who deserve better. So yeah, my schedule is chaotic‚Äîbut I‚Äôm passionate about it.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
A long-term friend. Someone I can talk to regularly. Could be about deep life stuff or stupid memes. Could be voice notes at 2am or random ‚Äúyou gotta hear this song‚Äù moments. I‚Äôm open-minded, respectful, and not here to waste anyone‚Äôs time.
And no, I won‚Äôt ghost you. I know how to hold a convo and actually enjoy it.

# Best iPhone 14 Pro Max Privacy Screen Protector [2025]

The iPhone 14 Pro Max is a powerhouse of technology, packed with sensitive personal and professional data. Protecting that data from prying eyes is crucial. A privacy screen protector is an essential accessory,limiting the viewing angle of the display,making it difficult for those nearby to see what's on your screen. With advancements in display technology and increasing concerns about data security, choosing the right privacy screen protector in 2025 requires careful consideration of several factors. This review dives deep into the top contenders, assessing their privacy, clarity, durability, and ease of installation to help you make an informed decision.

[[Explore Top Rated iphone 14 pro max privacy screen protector on Amazon.]](https://blog.rediys.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=iphone 14 pro max privacy screen protector)

## Key Features Analysis

the ideal iPhone 14 Pro Max privacy screen protector goes beyond simply blocking side views. It should offer a blend of robust security, excellent display clarity, and long-lasting durability.

**Privacy Angle:** This refers to the degree to which the screen needs to be viewed off-axis before the content becomes illegible. Most privacy screen protectors offer a 45-degree viewing angle. Though, some advanced models boast a narrower 30-degree viewing angle for enhanced security in crowded environments, ensuring only the user directly in front of the phone can see the display clearly. This level of security is particularly crucial for professionals handling sensitive data.

The effectiveness of the privacy filter depends on its construction. Higher quality filters utilize micro-louver technology that effectively blocks light transmission from the sides, creating a narrow viewing cone. some cheaper alternatives rely on simple tinting, compromising screen brightness and clarity.

**Screen Clarity and Touch Sensitivity:** A common complaint with older privacy screen protectors was their tendency to substantially reduce screen brightness and clarity. The best privacy screen protectors in 2025 utilize advanced optical technology to minimize this effect. They maintain a high level of openness,ensuring that the vibrant colors and sharpness of the iPhone 14 pro Max's Super Retina XDR display are preserved. Additionally,they are designed to be ultra-thin and responsive,guaranteeing accurate touch sensitivity and seamless interaction with the device.

Advanced coatings are employed to prevent smudging and fingerprint buildup, maintaining a clean and clear display even with frequent use.

**Durability and Scratch resistance:** The iPhone 14 Pro Max screen is inherently durable, but it‚Äôs still susceptible to scratches and minor impacts. A high-quality privacy screen protector should offer excellent scratch resistance, typically rated on the Mohs hardness scale. A 9H hardness rating indicates that the protector can withstand scratches from common objects like keys, coins, and even knives.Furthermore, the protector should be made from tempered glass with shatterproof properties.

In the event of a drop, the privacy screen protector will absorb the impact, protecting the underlying display from cracking. many protectors include an oleophobic coating that reduces fingerprints and smudges,maintaining a cleaner and clearer screen.

**Installation Process and Bubble Prevention:** A frustrating aspect of screen protectors is the potential for bubble formation during installation. The best privacy screen protectors come with comprehensive installation kits that include alignment frames, cleaning wipes, dust removal stickers, and squeegees. These tools make the process easier and more precise, minimizing the risk of trapped air bubbles.

Electrostatic adsorption technology ensures a seamless adhesion to the screen, pushing out any remaining air pockets automatically. Clear instructions and video tutorials further simplify the installation process.

**Material Composition:** The material used to manufacture a privacy screen protector directly impacts its performance and longevity.Premium protectors typically utilize multi-layered tempered glass with a specialized privacy film embedded within. The privacy film is constructed using micro-louver technology, which restricts the viewing angle. The surface is treated with an oleophobic coating to resist fingerprints and smudges.

The glass itself is often made using aluminosilicate glass, known for its superior strength and scratch resistance compared to customary soda-lime glass. These materials combine to provide optimal privacy, clarity, and durability.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a quality privacy screen protector for your iPhone 14 Pro Max offers several tangible benefits that enhance both your security and overall user experience.

**Enhanced Data Security:** The primary benefit is the obvious one: protecting sensitive information from visual hacking. In crowded environments like trains, buses, or cafes, a privacy screen significantly reduces the risk of someone peering over your shoulder and accessing your personal or professional data. This is especially crucial when handling confidential emails, financial transactions, or proprietary business information.

Imagine commuting to work on a crowded train and needing to respond to an urgent email containing sensitive financial data. Without a privacy screen protector, nearby passengers could easily glance at your screen and read the information. With a privacy screen protector, though, the content is only visible to you, ensuring your data remains safe and private.

**Preservation of Screen Clarity:** Unlike older generations of privacy screen protectors that significantly degraded screen clarity, modern versions are designed to minimize distortion and maintain the vibrant colors and sharpness of the iPhone 14 Pro Max's display. This allows you to enjoy a clear and crisp viewing experience without sacrificing privacy.

You can comfortably watch videos, browse photos, or work on documents without experiencing the grainy or washed-out effect that was common with older privacy screen protectors. The advanced optical technology ensures minimal interference with the display's performance.**Protection Against Scratches and impacts:** Beyond privacy, these screen protectors also offer robust protection against scratches and impacts, safeguarding the underlying display from damage. This prolongs the lifespan of your iPhone 14 Pro Max and helps maintain its resale value.

Think about accidentally dropping your iPhone 14 pro Max on a hard surface. Without a screen protector, the impact could shatter the display, resulting in costly repairs. With a quality privacy screen protector, the impact is absorbed, preventing damage to the underlying screen.

**Improved User Experience:** the best privacy screen protectors are designed to be ultra-thin and responsive, ensuring accurate touch sensitivity and seamless interaction with the device. They also feature oleophobic coatings that resist fingerprints and smudges,maintaining a cleaner and clearer screen.you can enjoy a smooth and effortless touch experience, unimpeded by the presence of the screen protector. Gestures, typing, and scrolling all feel natural and responsive. The oleophobic coating minimizes distracting fingerprints and smudges, keeping your screen looking clean and clear.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions related to iPhone 14 Pro Max privacy screen protectors:

**Can I reuse a privacy screen protector if I remove it?**
Generally, it is not recommended to reuse a privacy screen protector. Removing the protector can damage the adhesive layer and introduce dust or air bubbles during reinstallation. This can compromise both the privacy and protective features of the screen protector.**Will a privacy screen protector reduce the brightness of my iPhone 14 pro Max screen?**

The house has three bedrooms and two bathrooms. Currently, each parent has their own bedroom.

Recently, Jeff told our father that both parents need to share one room so that his 2-year-old daughter can have her own room. He gave our father a two-year deadline to move his belongings into our mom‚Äôs room. Additionally, Jeff has imposed several house rules, including not allowing our father to drink coffee or eat in his room, which upset him greatly. As a result, our father moved out to live with our other sibling, Danny.

Our mother is still living at the house but is unhappy. She feels guilty about moving out because she knows Jeff wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford the mortgage without the financial support or our parents living there.

Over the course of the next week, Mandy spent more and more time at the farmhouse. By the weekend, she had practically moved in. I felt like I was engaging in some shameful and depraved act of perversion, but like an addict, I continued to indulge. There was something about the way Mandy would look at me that made it impossible to even think of saying the word ‚Äúno.‚Äù

Each time I began to consider the horror of what she was putting into motion, I would picture my brother going over the edge of the well. That's how I ended up sitting at my kitchen table while Mandy talked with the sheriff over the phone. Apparently, he was a Wisher too.

I tried my best to ignore what was taking place with my consent. I failed miserably in that endeavor.

Mandy had arranged a prisoner to be brought up to the farm under the guise of a work-release program. I closed my eyes and forced myself to not think about what would happen this evening. I failed at that as well.

Mandy must have sensed this, because after she hung up the phone, she walked to where I was to lift my chin up with a gentle push of her index finger and kissed me deeply. It was almost supernatural how the words entered my mind as she pressed against me.

I suppose if it's just criminals...

I knew it was only the first of many rationalizations I would have to make. Still, I let myself be drawn into it. As she pulled away, I only barely registered that I was condemning a man to die.

Life with Mandy was dream-like. After the months of solitude, waking with her by my side didn't feel quite real. I'd reach out and brush my fingers along her black hair, pulling the strands from her ivory shoulders and watch as she'd smile in her sleep. If this was a dream, I never wanted to wake from it.

I'd wake up early and have coffee with her as she would get ready to leave for the bar. Not long after she left, Otto would appear and talk for a while. I didn't have the courage to tell him what Mandy was doing, but he also didn't ask. Instead, he'd tell me how much happier I looked and that he was looking forward to meeting Sarah and Blake when they came to visit.

I'm ashamed to admit it, but Otto was right. I was happier. Even talking with my mother had become easier. When she'd hold out hope that Danny might come back someday, I found myself smiling and thinking that he actually might. Mandy had told me that I could have anything I wanted so long as I was willing to provide the flesh the Well would desire as its price. More and more, that price didn't seem as steep as it had.

When the evening came that day, Mandy and I were waiting in the driveway as the sheriff pulled up in his SUV. He tipped his hat to Mandy and I, and even though he was wearing sunglasses, I was sure I saw a wink. He then went to the back of the vehicle and led out a man that couldn't have been older than twenty. The sheriff held the young man by his handcuffs as he walked him towards where Mandy and I were standing. We wordlessly turned and began leading the way to the Well.

‚ÄúI just want to say that I appreciate the opportunity to-‚Äù the young man began to say nervously, only to be cut off by the sheriff's sharp voice.

‚ÄúNo need to talk, son. They're about to go over orientation. Better listen up.‚Äù

I realized this was my cue and swallowed hard before speaking.

‚ÄúDon't worry, it's an easy job. We had some damage to the interior of this well and just needed someone to get lowered down to repair the masonry. It won't take long.‚Äù

We arrived at the well just as I finished speaking, a contraption of wood and cable suspended above it. It was a simple pulley system I had rigged up the night before. There was a hand crank at the base of the structure which would either draw a cable up or down depending on the way you moved it. At the end of the cable was a harness held in place by a metal spring-clip.

After he had his handcuffs removed, the young man nervously pulled it towards himself and put it on while the sheriff, Mandy and myself watched him wordlessly. After he had pulled the last strap tight around his thigh, he looked out at us expectantly.

‚ÄúOkay, go ahead and step into the well,‚Äù Mandy urged with a pleasant smile.

The young man suddenly looked confused.

‚ÄúWhere's the tools?‚Äù

Oh shit.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù asked Mandy, the pleasant smile suddenly replaced by irritated confusion.

‚ÄúYou want me to go down there and fix something, right? Where's the tools? I don't see any around here. It's just strange is all,‚Äù he he said slowly, eyes going from one person to the next and a look of trepidation darkening his features.

In response to this, the sheriff pulled his pistol from his holster with a slow and deliberate movement accompanied with an irritated sigh. He pulled back the slide chambering a round as the young man flinched backwards and began to take breaths in rapid secession.

‚ÄúCome on, don't do this! I just took some stuff! Pleas don't do this!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa, calm down! The tools are down there already, there's no need to freak out, okay?‚Äù I heard myself saying as I lifted my arms with my pams out in a disarming gesture.

The kid seemed to calm down a little, turning towards the well while the sheriff lowered his gun. The kid let go of the side of the well and was hanging over it, nervous sweat beading on his forehead.

‚ÄúOkay, so I just go down there and fix the well, right?‚Äù

I smiled at him, my hand reaching past the lever of the pulley system and instead grabbing the clip joining the harness to the cable.

‚ÄúThat's right kid. You're gonna fix the well.‚Äù I said reassuringly while my stomach churned.

I pressed down on the release and the clip came away with a loud snap. For just a moment, the kid's face contorted into a look of desperate terror as he sucked in air to prepare for a scream that never came. His gasp echoed up from the dark only to be followed by a meaty crunch. Then another. And another.

I stood there, bracing for the realization of what I had just done to settle over me with its totality, but the shock never came. Instead, I felt only relief mixed with cold acceptance.

When I finally did turn away, I saw Mandy and the sheriff both kneeling upon one knee with their heads down. Mandy was the first to lift her face up towards mine, her green eyes shining with renewed vigor. I had thought she was was in her forties, but the woman before me looked ten years younger than that. She stood to her feet and wrapped her arms around my waist with a coy smile.

‚ÄúHow many more,‚Äù I said, burying my face into her shoulder.

She laid a hand across the back of my head, her dark embrace a more complete oblivion than even the liquor could afford me. She pulled me in with those slow and deliberate movements, each smooth action reminiscent of a languid wave washing ashore... or a snake caressing its prey.

‚ÄúAs many as it takes, my love. As many as it takes for your dream to come true.‚Äù

I finally embraced her back, having made up my mind. After all, if it's just criminals that are being killed...



Sarah and Blake arrived a couple days after that. I picked them up from the airport with Mandy riding in the passenger seat. It was a three hour long drive back into the countryside, so we had plenty of time to get to know one another. I had been a little nervous that things might be awkward, but to my relief, it was the most normal moment I've had since I got the phone call about grandpa Silas's stroke all those months ago.

Sarah and Blake were standing next to the parking area as we pulled up. I got out and helped with their luggage, getting a good look at the two of them as I did so. Sarah had blonde hair that fell almost to her waist laced with a few streaks of premature gray. She bore the weight of the last few months admirably, but the wear of such exertion was clear upon her face in the dark rings beneath her eyes.

Blake stayed close to his mother, regarding me with a shy curiosity. When he met Mandy, that shy curiosity gave away to outright infatuation. He sat just behind her in the car, completely drawn in as Mandy described the veritable feast she would be preparing once we arrived home. She would look back at him and smile occasionally, those bright green eyes flaring with infectious excitement as she described the fun he'd have fishing and camping.

‚ÄúCamping sounds amazing, I haven't done that in years,‚Äù Sarah sighed from the backseat.

‚ÄúIt's going to be great, there's a really cool campsite the town uses,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere's lots of families up there this time of year, it's a lot of fun.‚Äù

I saw Blake grinning ear to ear through the rear view mirror and laid my hand on Mandy's knee. I felt her hand slide over the top of mine and give it a squeeze.

We pulled up to the farmhouse as the sun was beginning to set. I walked behind everyone else with the bags and glanced towards the silhouette of the well standing black against the waning light of the sun, the pulley system looking like gallows, and realized that this was the longest I'd gone without feeding it since I had come here. I smiled and followed the others inside.

Blake was falling asleep before we had even finished dinner and was already snoring upstairs as Mandy uncorked a bottle of red wine. She settled in at the table with the bottle and three glasses and began to pour.

‚ÄúSo how'd you two meet?‚Äù Sarah asked as the ruby liquid splashed from the bottle into a glass.

‚ÄúIt's actually really cute,‚Äù Mandy began. ‚ÄúDo you believe in fate?‚Äù

To her credit, Sarah didn't roll her eyes, though I wouldn't have blamed her if she had.

‚ÄúI'm not sure if I do or not, but I'm listening,‚Äù she said with an amused grin.

‚ÄúWell, Ches would come in every now and again when he was in town, but never really talked much. So, one day, I decide I'm going to flirt with him.‚Äù

Sarah snorted a little and Mandy gave me a wry smirk. I could tell she was enjoying telling this story she had invented.

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù Sarah prompted with another laugh.

‚ÄúI walk over to where he's sitting at the bar and tell him he looks like the first boy I ever kissed when I was eleven years old, and he looks at me like I'm crazy, but now I have his attention.‚Äù

She paused to take a sip of wine dramatically, masterfully building the tension. She finished and sat the glass down, turning to me to act out her next scene of the story.

‚ÄúYou know you never forget your first kiss, right? What was yours like?‚Äù She asked with exaggerated innocence and femininity, then dropped her voice into a mimic of my own. ‚ÄúMy first kiss happened not far from here at the lake where everyone goes camping. ‚ÄúI was visiting my grandpa and met a girl up there over the weekend. On the last day, I finally got up the courage to kiss her by the lake.‚Äù

She paused again, looking at me adoringly and slipping her hand into mine, all the teasing and mimicry melting from her voice as it filled with emotion.

‚ÄúI told him that's crazy, because that's exactly how I had my first kiss with old man Silas's grandson...‚Äù

I smiled at Mandy, staring deep into those implacable green eyes as she squeezed my hand. The story was a complete falsehood, pure fiction with no other purpose than to explain our meeting. Still, I lost myself in that fiction. I lost myself in Mandy's dream.

Sarah smiled at us fondly, then broke into crying with a sudden gasp.

‚ÄúI'm sorry, I don't mean to-‚Äù

Mandy was already on her feet, an arm around Sarah's shoulders as she told her not to worry.

‚ÄúIt's just the wine, honey, it's okay,‚Äù Mandy soothed.

‚ÄúI know, I just miss him...‚Äù Sarah whispered, turning to look into my eyes. ‚ÄúI know you miss him too, Ches.‚Äù

I nodded and laid my hand on her shoulder, unable to hold her gaze. I tried not to think of the fact that she was trying to comfort me, the man who had killed her husband. The only thing that allowed me to withstand that thought was the belief that I could also be the man who returned him to her.

The next day, we left for the campsite. I left the barn door open for Otto, in case he needed to borrow the tractor, and left to enjoy a week out at the lake. We had brought tents, fishing poles, food and about a dozen bottles of wine to enjoy over the next week. We all piled into the car and started on the short drive, no more than a few miles away.

We crested the final hill and could see Lake Meder in the distance, reflecting the brilliance of the sun upon its gentle waters. There was already a good number of tents around it and a few small boats on the water with fishing poles bristling over the sides.

We parked and retrieved all our gear to begin walking to our camping spot. On the way there, we passed families setting up their own tents, playing with frisbees or just sitting around their campsites. As we got closer to the water, we could see lots of kids Blake's age all playing on the beach or swimming.

‚ÄúCan I go swimming, mom?‚Äù Blake asked excitedly.

‚ÄúAfter you set up your tent. Where else are you gonna change into your bathing suit?‚Äù Sarah responded with a laugh.

We got to our spot and started setting up tents and unpacking gear. A short distance away was a family doing the same. There was a man and woman as well as a little girl about Blake's age. The man had a large build and dark brown hair. I recognized him from town as Calvin Larson, one of the managers of the feed store. I'd talked with him a few times and deduced that the woman must be his wife, Jennifer, and the little girl would be his daughter, Cary. I waved and smiled at them, prompting them to do the same.

For the first time since I had arrived in this place, I actually felt like I belonged in that moment.

We finished setting up the campsite and Blake wasted no time in changing into swimming trunks and running down to the lake. Sarah looked at Mandy and smiled.

‚ÄúThank you guys for this. It means a lot. It's the first time I've seen him this happy since his father disappeared.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thank you for being here,‚Äù Mandy said, giving Sarah a hug. ‚ÄúYou two don't even realize how much we wanted to have you here.‚Äù

I let Mandy and Sarah have their moment. I decided I would go down to the lake and fish off the dock. I had my rod and reel in one hand and my tackle box in the other as I followed the little trail that ran down from the hill we had camped on. I arrived at the dock and flicked my rod through the air, hearing the satisfying splash of my baited hook hit the water as I sat down.

I had been sitting out there for a few minutes when I heard foot steps echoing on the wooden planks of the dock. I looked up to see Calvin Larson walking towards me with his own rod and reel.

‚ÄúHi there, neighbor!‚Äù he exclaimed with a cheerful smile.

‚ÄúHey Cal, you're fishing too, huh?‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúWell, I hope to, but I'm gonna have to borrow some bait. I don't have any in my tackle box. I can trade for it though,‚Äù he said as he drew near, setting his tackle box on the dock and opening to reveal it had been filled with ice and beer.

‚ÄúI think we can make a deal,‚Äù I laughed, grinning at him.

We cracked a couple cans of beer and sat there on the dock, lines in the water and the sun shining overhead.

‚ÄúSo, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help.‚Äù

I looked at Calvin with a raised eyebrow. I had ceased to be shocked by locals knowing about the worst kept secret in town.

‚ÄúThat's good to know, Cal. Seriously, it's appreciated,‚Äù I answered him and took another sip of beer.

From where we sat, we could see Cary and Blake swimming in the lake. I smiled, remembering how Danny and I would play out here as kids.

‚ÄúI think it's going to be a fun week,‚Äù Calvin said next to me. ‚ÄúThe wife and I are going to grill tomorrow night. You'll have to bring everyone over.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds fun, we'll be there with a bottle of wine‚Äù I confirmed with a content sigh.

The stars that night were incredible, an explosion of light painted across the sky. Mandy and I watched them while laying next to each other in the grass. She was curled up against my side, head resting against my chest. I helped her to her feet and led her to our tent where she laid down and fell right to sleep. I stepped out to douse the fire and heard a voice coming from Blake's tent. I crept closer and peaked through the perforated material near the top to see Blake and Cary sitting next to each other.

‚ÄúI like you too...‚Äù I heard Cary whisper.

Blake leaned forward and kissed her awkwardly on the lips. They parted and grinned at each other.

‚ÄúI have to go back before they realize I'm gone,‚Äù she said after a moment.

‚ÄúOkay, but I'll see you tomorrow, right?‚Äù Blake whispered to her.

‚ÄúYou better,‚Äù Cary said with a grin as she stood up to sneak back out.

I hid behind the tent as she left, smiling at the innocence of it all.

Danny would have been proud of him.

No.

Danny will be proud of him.

I next morning, Mandy surprised us by make pancakes and coffee. She had brought a French Press, which was already full of rich, dark coffee wafting through the air as we awoke. She made me jump by appearing right in front of me as I unzipped the door of the tent. I laughed at my own fright as she handed me a coffee cup and kissed my cheek.

‚ÄúOh my God, is that coffee?‚Äù came Sarah from the doorway of her own tent.

‚ÄúIt is, honey, and there's pancakes too!‚Äù Mandy tittered as she poured another cup of coffee.

‚ÄúI like the way this day is starting,‚Äù I said wish a grin.

‚ÄúThen you'll love what we're doing later,‚Äù Mandy said with a sly wink.

‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe're having a picnic. I got a nice bottle of rose' and packed some bread and cheese for us.‚Äù

I took another sip of coffee, once again wondering if this could even be real. I decided I wouldn't question it too much, letting out an audible moan of approval at the quality of the coffee.

After we packed our provisions and hiked out to a little spot on a hill, Mandy and I sprawled on a blanket with a bottle of wine and a basket between us. We sipped and giggled as the light glittered off the tiny waves of the lake in the distance.

‚ÄúJust so you know, I'm really happy with you,‚Äù I suddenly told her.

She wordlessly reached out and held my hand, smiling at me with those perfect eyes.

We laid there watching as the clouds drifted lazily through the sky with our fingers intertwined. I thought back to the Harvest Moon and my sheer panic and horror as I fed a dead body into the well. Here I was after killing a living man and condemning him to the well, and I felt serene. I didn't feel an inkling of guilt. If there ever was any, it had been swallowed up the twin emeralds that shined out from Mandy's eyes.

By the time we got back to the camp, it was already sunset and we could smell the smoke of the Larsons beginning to grill. As promised, Sarah, Blake, Mandy and I arrived with a bottle of wine. Before long, we all sat around the fire, eating and talking.

‚ÄúSo, what do you think of our town so far, Sarah?‚Äù Calvin asked her courteously with a smile.

‚ÄúI like it a lot! I wish we would have come down earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kept you from visiting?‚Äù Jennifer, Calvin's wife, asked.

‚ÄúMostly my husband's job,‚Äù Sarah said, then stopped suddenly, clearly having tripped over small patch of pain she hadn't seen.

‚ÄúYea, Jenny and I heard about what had happened with your husband. We're real sorry to hear about it,‚Äù Calvin said in a sympathetic tone.

‚ÄúThank you. I pray to God everyday that he comes home,‚Äù Sarah added in a voice scarce above a whisper.

‚ÄúWe'll make sure to pray as well. God works miracles everyday,‚Äù came Jennifer's reassurance.

‚ÄúYes, he does,‚Äù Mandy said, looking at Blake with a smile as she did so. ‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.‚Äù

Looking back now, I shudder when I think of her saying that. However, at the time, I smiled at her and enjoyed my food and wine.

The night air was cool but not cold, and as the night wore on, we all entered a comfortable stupor of well fed euphoria and decided to call it a night. Blake and Sarah went to their tents with sleepy smiles on their faces and Mandy and I lounged by the fire.

There, in that moment, I'm pretty sure I was the happiest I had ever been in my entire life. That being said, I can't be certain that it doesn't just seem like that when juxtaposed by the events that came after.

I woke up in the dark. I looked over to where Mandy should have been, but she wasn't there. Feeling confused, I got up and walked to the open door flap of the tent. There was a stillness to the air that felt... wrong. I looked around, but Mandy was nowhere to be seen. As my eyes scanned the dark around the camp for a human form, I noticed Blake's tent was open as well. When I looked into the opening, I could see that Blake was missing too.

I began to get a bad feeling, but pushed it down. I instead walked towards the Larson campsite to see if maybe Mandy and Blake were over there, but when I arrived, I found their tents all empty.

The foreboding sensation boiling in my stomach began to evolve into a blooming sense of dread in my chest. I spent the next few minutes jogging to where I parked the car only to find it gone when I arrived. I tried to ignore what my mind was beginning to put together and began walking.

It was a few miles back to the farm by road, but with cutting through fields and hopping a few fences, I could make it back there in about an hour and a half. Every step I took, my mind began to race faster and faster.

‚ÄúSo, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help,‚Äù I could hear Cal saying.

I walked a bit longer.

‚ÄúThe well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better,‚Äù I could hear Mandy saying in my mind.

I walked faster now, my heart thundering in my chest.

‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle,‚Äù I could hear her saying to Blake now.

I ran the last bit of the way from there. I jumped the fence and entered into the massive cornfield that led up to the farmhouse. The corn pressed in from all sides, but I knew to keep the fence to my left as I followed it up to where I could see firelight dancing in the distance.

The first thing I arrived at was the barn. I crept up to the doors, trying to open them as silently as possible. I could hear voices in the distance, down by where the well sat silent and hungry. I went to pull the door open, but found it locked. It was at that moment that I realized I forgot to grab my keys from the camp.

I crept around the side of the barn until I could see the well and the crowd that had gathered around it. At least three dozen people were holding torches and all facing the well, seemingly waiting for something.

‚ÄúChester...‚Äù I heard a rumbling voice speak from just behind me.

I turned and was relieved to see Otto standing there.

‚ÄúThank God, Otto, we need to do something. I think they're about to sacrifice Blake to the well.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry, Chester, they would never do that. Blake is the next caretaker.‚Äù

My blood froze in my veins and I took an involuntary step backwards.

‚ÄúWhat are you saying... Otto, that can't be what's happening.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe must feed the well, Chester.‚Äù

Otto began to change in front of me. His features became less defined. He still looked like an old man, but there was something else there now too. It was like looking at something with 3D glasses, but the second image was something grotesque. Too many eyes and a mouth that was more of a mandible than anything human.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I shouted and jumped back.

I wasn't fast enough and Otto grabbed both of my arms in his and held me in place. I struggled, but his iron grip held me there.

‚ÄúCome, Chester. Come witness a miracle.‚Äù

He began marching me towards the well, hauling me as I kicked and scrambled uselessly the whole way.

I recognized some of the people gathered there. There was Henry, a regular at the bar. Jordan, the girl who ran the sewing shop in town. Jennifer Larson, who's husband and daughter were noticeably absent.

Oh no.

I realized what was happening them. I looked over to the farmhouse to see Mandy leading Blake towards the well with a hand on either shoulder, the boy beaming with a toothy smile. Behind her was Calvin similarly leading Cary. I twisted hard in Otto's grasp to no avail.

‚ÄúDo you know how long I had endured you grandfather's meager rations? How long the most I could look forward to was a desiccated corpse to be thrown down my gullet?‚Äù He leaned in near me, his voice a low snarl. ‚ÄúDo you know much I've hungered in the dark?‚Äù

I was crying now, tears streaming down my face.

‚ÄúPlease... please, let me go...‚Äù

Otto responded with stony silence as he turned me towards the well and held me in place by my shoulders. I watched as Mandy led Blake to where he could watch. I could hear her as she looked down and spoke to him.

‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.‚Äù

Calvin lifted Cary up and sat her on the edge of the well, giving her a kiss on her forehead. She looked up at him serenely, not a hint of terror on her face. That's when he turned and looked at me expectantly.

‚ÄúYou have to choose, Chester.‚Äù Otto whispered behind me. ‚ÄúYou have to choose to make this trade. Ask for your brother to be returned to you and he shall be.‚Äù

I closed my eyes hard, then opened them and looked into Mandy's green orbs that looked back at me with a smile. I looked back over to Calvin with his face of grim expectation. Finally, I opened my mouth and I spoke.



It's been a while since all that happened. I'm sitting in the airport now, waiting to board my flight, writing this on my laptop. I'm flying back home to the farm after picking up Susan.

I met Susan on a message board about the paranormal. She's only seventeen, but she wants to start her own paranormal YouTube channel. I went out to meet her and we're flying back to the farm so she can research the well.

I told her there's some kind of weird artifact at the bottom of it.

It's wrong, sure, but I'm going to have my brother over soon. He was found a couple weeks ago with amnesia a few towns away. No idea how he got there, and with him having no memory of how it happened, it looked like a mystery that would never be solved. I wasn't able to see the tearful reunion between him and Sarah, but I was definitely happy to hear about it.

It was definitely something Blake needed. After he got back from the camping trip, he had been really quiet and withdrawn, but his dad's reappearance seemed to have brought him out of it.

Sarah just seemed happy to have her family back.

I'm having all three of them as well as a bunch of other guests out over to the farm for the wedding. Mandy and I still haven't decided where we want to go to for our honeymoon, but at least we know the well will be okay in the meantime.

Well, Susan and I are boarding the plane now, so I have to go. She's so happy and bubbly that I almost feel some guilt for what I'm about to do. Almost.

At the end of the day, I have to do what I was always meant to do. I have to feed the well.

Here are 10 cultural norms and social habits that make Syrian society beautiful, layered, and sometimes hilariously confusing, especially if you didn‚Äôt grow up with them:

	1.	Social Rituals is Real: Syrians will insist you stay for dinner 5 times, and actually mean it‚Ä¶ sort of. Learn to read the room.

	2.	Hospitality = Identity: If you walk into a Syrian home, you will be offered tea, juice, coffee, fruit, nuts, and possibly their kidneys.

	3.	Age = Authority: Elders are respected, expect younger people to stand when older ones enter a room.

	4.	Shoes Stay Outside: Yes, even if they‚Äôre really expensive Jordans.

	5.	Never Say No to Food (even if you‚Äôre full): Just accept it. Or fake it convincingly.

	6.	Personal Space? What‚Äôs That?: Close talkers. Warm huggers. Emotional expressers. Prepare yourself.

	7.	Friday is Family Day: And by family, we mean 42 people in one room shouting and laughing and debating life.

	8.	‚ÄúInsha‚ÄôAllah‚Äù is Not a Promise: It means maybe, possibly, never, or yes. Depending on tone.

	9.	Sarcasm & Jokes = Love Language: If a Syrian teases you, they like you.

	10.	Religion & Culture Intertwine: Even secular Syrians often celebrate religious holidays or customs out of tradition, not necessarily belief.

Over the course of the next week, Mandy spent more and more time at the farmhouse. By the weekend, she had practically moved in. I felt like I was engaging in some shameful and depraved act of perversion, but like an addict, I continued to indulge. There was something about the way Mandy would look at me that made it impossible to even think of saying the word ‚Äúno.‚Äù

Each time I began to consider the horror of what she was putting into motion, I would picture my brother going over the edge of the well. That's how I ended up sitting at my kitchen table while Mandy talked with the sheriff over the phone. Apparently, he was a Wisher too.

I tried my best to ignore what was taking place with my consent. I failed miserably in that endeavor.

Mandy had arranged a prisoner to be brought up to the farm under the guise of a work-release program. I closed my eyes and forced myself to not think about what would happen this evening. I failed at that as well.

Mandy must have sensed this, because after she hung up the phone, she walked to where I was to lift my chin up with a gentle push of her index finger and kissed me deeply. It was almost supernatural how the words entered my mind as she pressed against me.

I suppose if it's just criminals...

I knew it was only the first of many rationalizations I would have to make. Still, I let myself be drawn into it. As she pulled away, I only barely registered that I was condemning a man to die.

Life with Mandy was dream-like. After the months of solitude, waking with her by my side didn't feel quite real. I'd reach out and brush my fingers along her black hair, pulling the strands from her ivory shoulders and watch as she'd smile in her sleep. If this was a dream, I never wanted to wake from it.

I'd wake up early and have coffee with her as she would get ready to leave for the bar. Not long after she left, Otto would appear and talk for a while. I didn't have the courage to tell him what Mandy was doing, but he also didn't ask. Instead, he'd tell me how much happier I looked and that he was looking forward to meeting Sarah and Blake when they came to visit.

I'm ashamed to admit it, but Otto was right. I was happier. Even talking with my mother had become easier. When she'd hold out hope that Danny might come back someday, I found myself smiling and thinking that he actually might. Mandy had told me that I could have anything I wanted so long as I was willing to provide the flesh the Well would desire as its price. More and more, that price didn't seem as steep as it had.

When the evening came that day, Mandy and I were waiting in the driveway as the sheriff pulled up in his SUV. He tipped his hat to Mandy and I, and even though he was wearing sunglasses, I was sure I saw a wink. He then went to the back of the vehicle and led out a man that couldn't have been older than twenty. The sheriff held the young man by his handcuffs as he walked him towards where Mandy and I were standing. We wordlessly turned and began leading the way to the Well.

‚ÄúI just want to say that I appreciate the opportunity to-‚Äù the young man began to say nervously, only to be cut off by the sheriff's sharp voice.

‚ÄúNo need to talk, son. They're about to go over orientation. Better listen up.‚Äù

I realized this was my cue and swallowed hard before speaking.

‚ÄúDon't worry, it's an easy job. We had some damage to the interior of this well and just needed someone to get lowered down to repair the masonry. It won't take long.‚Äù

We arrived at the well just as I finished speaking, a contraption of wood and cable suspended above it. It was a simple pulley system I had rigged up the night before. There was a hand crank at the base of the structure which would either draw a cable up or down depending on the way you moved it. At the end of the cable was a harness held in place by a metal spring-clip.

After he had his handcuffs removed, the young man nervously pulled it towards himself and put it on while the sheriff, Mandy and myself watched him wordlessly. After he had pulled the last strap tight around his thigh, he looked out at us expectantly.

‚ÄúOkay, go ahead and step into the well,‚Äù Mandy urged with a pleasant smile.

The young man suddenly looked confused.

‚ÄúWhere's the tools?‚Äù

Oh shit.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù asked Mandy, the pleasant smile suddenly replaced by irritated confusion.

‚ÄúYou want me to go down there and fix something, right? Where's the tools? I don't see any around here. It's just strange is all,‚Äù he he said slowly, eyes going from one person to the next and a look of trepidation darkening his features.

In response to this, the sheriff pulled his pistol from his holster with a slow and deliberate movement accompanied with an irritated sigh. He pulled back the slide chambering a round as the young man flinched backwards and began to take breaths in rapid secession.

‚ÄúCome on, don't do this! I just took some stuff! Pleas don't do this!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa, calm down! The tools are down there already, there's no need to freak out, okay?‚Äù I heard myself saying as I lifted my arms with my pams out in a disarming gesture.

The kid seemed to calm down a little, turning towards the well while the sheriff lowered his gun. The kid let go of the side of the well and was hanging over it, nervous sweat beading on his forehead.

‚ÄúOkay, so I just go down there and fix the well, right?‚Äù

I smiled at him, my hand reaching past the lever of the pulley system and instead grabbing the clip joining the harness to the cable.

‚ÄúThat's right kid. You're gonna fix the well.‚Äù I said reassuringly while my stomach churned.

I pressed down on the release and the clip came away with a loud snap. For just a moment, the kid's face contorted into a look of desperate terror as he sucked in air to prepare for a scream that never came. His gasp echoed up from the dark only to be followed by a meaty crunch. Then another. And another.

I stood there, bracing for the realization of what I had just done to settle over me with its totality, but the shock never came. Instead, I felt only relief mixed with cold acceptance.

When I finally did turn away, I saw Mandy and the sheriff both kneeling upon one knee with their heads down. Mandy was the first to lift her face up towards mine, her green eyes shining with renewed vigor. I had thought she was was in her forties, but the woman before me looked ten years younger than that. She stood to her feet and wrapped her arms around my waist with a coy smile.

‚ÄúHow many more,‚Äù I said, burying my face into her shoulder.

She laid a hand across the back of my head, her dark embrace a more complete oblivion than even the liquor could afford me. She pulled me in with those slow and deliberate movements, each smooth action reminiscent of a languid wave washing ashore... or a snake caressing its prey.

‚ÄúAs many as it takes, my love. As many as it takes for your dream to come true.‚Äù

I finally embraced her back, having made up my mind. After all, if it's just criminals that are being killed...



Sarah and Blake arrived a couple days after that. I picked them up from the airport with Mandy riding in the passenger seat. It was a three hour long drive back into the countryside, so we had plenty of time to get to know one another. I had been a little nervous that things might be awkward, but to my relief, it was the most normal moment I've had since I got the phone call about grandpa Silas's stroke all those months ago.

Sarah and Blake were standing next to the parking area as we pulled up. I got out and helped with their luggage, getting a good look at the two of them as I did so. Sarah had blonde hair that fell almost to her waist laced with a few streaks of premature gray. She bore the weight of the last few months admirably, but the wear of such exertion was clear upon her face in the dark rings beneath her eyes.

Blake stayed close to his mother, regarding me with a shy curiosity. When he met Mandy, that shy curiosity gave away to outright infatuation. He sat just behind her in the car, completely drawn in as Mandy described the veritable feast she would be preparing once we arrived home. She would look back at him and smile occasionally, those bright green eyes flaring with infectious excitement as she described the fun he'd have fishing and camping.

‚ÄúCamping sounds amazing, I haven't done that in years,‚Äù Sarah sighed from the backseat.

‚ÄúIt's going to be great, there's a really cool campsite the town uses,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere's lots of families up there this time of year, it's a lot of fun.‚Äù

I saw Blake grinning ear to ear through the rear view mirror and laid my hand on Mandy's knee. I felt her hand slide over the top of mine and give it a squeeze.

We pulled up to the farmhouse as the sun was beginning to set. I walked behind everyone else with the bags and glanced towards the silhouette of the well standing black against the waning light of the sun, the pulley system looking like gallows, and realized that this was the longest I'd gone without feeding it since I had come here. I smiled and followed the others inside.

Blake was falling asleep before we had even finished dinner and was already snoring upstairs as Mandy uncorked a bottle of red wine. She settled in at the table with the bottle and three glasses and began to pour.

‚ÄúSo how'd you two meet?‚Äù Sarah asked as the ruby liquid splashed from the bottle into a glass.

‚ÄúIt's actually really cute,‚Äù Mandy began. ‚ÄúDo you believe in fate?‚Äù

To her credit, Sarah didn't roll her eyes, though I wouldn't have blamed her if she had.

‚ÄúI'm not sure if I do or not, but I'm listening,‚Äù she said with an amused grin.

‚ÄúWell, Ches would come in every now and again when he was in town, but never really talked much. So, one day, I decide I'm going to flirt with him.‚Äù

Sarah snorted a little and Mandy gave me a wry smirk. I could tell she was enjoying telling this story she had invented.

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù Sarah prompted with another laugh.

‚ÄúI walk over to where he's sitting at the bar and tell him he looks like the first boy I ever kissed when I was eleven years old, and he looks at me like I'm crazy, but now I have his attention.‚Äù

She paused to take a sip of wine dramatically, masterfully building the tension. She finished and sat the glass down, turning to me to act out her next scene of the story.

‚ÄúYou know you never forget your first kiss, right? What was yours like?‚Äù She asked with exaggerated innocence and femininity, then dropped her voice into a mimic of my own. ‚ÄúMy first kiss happened not far from here at the lake where everyone goes camping. ‚ÄúI was visiting my grandpa and met a girl up there over the weekend. On the last day, I finally got up the courage to kiss her by the lake.‚Äù

She paused again, looking at me adoringly and slipping her hand into mine, all the teasing and mimicry melting from her voice as it filled with emotion.

‚ÄúI told him that's crazy, because that's exactly how I had my first kiss with old man Silas's grandson...‚Äù

I smiled at Mandy, staring deep into those implacable green eyes as she squeezed my hand. The story was a complete falsehood, pure fiction with no other purpose than to explain our meeting. Still, I lost myself in that fiction. I lost myself in Mandy's dream.

Sarah smiled at us fondly, then broke into crying with a sudden gasp.

‚ÄúI'm sorry, I don't mean to-‚Äù

Mandy was already on her feet, an arm around Sarah's shoulders as she told her not to worry.

‚ÄúIt's just the wine, honey, it's okay,‚Äù Mandy soothed.

‚ÄúI know, I just miss him...‚Äù Sarah whispered, turning to look into my eyes. ‚ÄúI know you miss him too, Ches.‚Äù

I nodded and laid my hand on her shoulder, unable to hold her gaze. I tried not to think of the fact that she was trying to comfort me, the man who had killed her husband. The only thing that allowed me to withstand that thought was the belief that I could also be the man who returned him to her.

The next day, we left for the campsite. I left the barn door open for Otto, in case he needed to borrow the tractor, and left to enjoy a week out at the lake. We had brought tents, fishing poles, food and about a dozen bottles of wine to enjoy over the next week. We all piled into the car and started on the short drive, no more than a few miles away.

We crested the final hill and could see Lake Meder in the distance, reflecting the brilliance of the sun upon its gentle waters. There was already a good number of tents around it and a few small boats on the water with fishing poles bristling over the sides.

We parked and retrieved all our gear to begin walking to our camping spot. On the way there, we passed families setting up their own tents, playing with frisbees or just sitting around their campsites. As we got closer to the water, we could see lots of kids Blake's age all playing on the beach or swimming.

‚ÄúCan I go swimming, mom?‚Äù Blake asked excitedly.

‚ÄúAfter you set up your tent. Where else are you gonna change into your bathing suit?‚Äù Sarah responded with a laugh.

We got to our spot and started setting up tents and unpacking gear. A short distance away was a family doing the same. There was a man and woman as well as a little girl about Blake's age. The man had a large build and dark brown hair. I recognized him from town as Calvin Larson, one of the managers of the feed store. I'd talked with him a few times and deduced that the woman must be his wife, Jennifer, and the little girl would be his daughter, Cary. I waved and smiled at them, prompting them to do the same.

For the first time since I had arrived in this place, I actually felt like I belonged in that moment.

We finished setting up the campsite and Blake wasted no time in changing into swimming trunks and running down to the lake. Sarah looked at Mandy and smiled.

‚ÄúThank you guys for this. It means a lot. It's the first time I've seen him this happy since his father disappeared.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thank you for being here,‚Äù Mandy said, giving Sarah a hug. ‚ÄúYou two don't even realize how much we wanted to have you here.‚Äù

I let Mandy and Sarah have their moment. I decided I would go down to the lake and fish off the dock. I had my rod and reel in one hand and my tackle box in the other as I followed the little trail that ran down from the hill we had camped on. I arrived at the dock and flicked my rod through the air, hearing the satisfying splash of my baited hook hit the water as I sat down.

I had been sitting out there for a few minutes when I heard foot steps echoing on the wooden planks of the dock. I looked up to see Calvin Larson walking towards me with his own rod and reel.

‚ÄúHi there, neighbor!‚Äù he exclaimed with a cheerful smile.

‚ÄúHey Cal, you're fishing too, huh?‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúWell, I hope to, but I'm gonna have to borrow some bait. I don't have any in my tackle box. I can trade for it though,‚Äù he said as he drew near, setting his tackle box on the dock and opening to reveal it had been filled with ice and beer.

‚ÄúI think we can make a deal,‚Äù I laughed, grinning at him.

We cracked a couple cans of beer and sat there on the dock, lines in the water and the sun shining overhead.

‚ÄúSo, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help.‚Äù

I looked at Calvin with a raised eyebrow. I had ceased to be shocked by locals knowing about the worst kept secret in town.

‚ÄúThat's good to know, Cal. Seriously, it's appreciated,‚Äù I answered him and took another sip of beer.

From where we sat, we could see Cary and Blake swimming in the lake. I smiled, remembering how Danny and I would play out here as kids.

‚ÄúI think it's going to be a fun week,‚Äù Calvin said next to me. ‚ÄúThe wife and I are going to grill tomorrow night. You'll have to bring everyone over.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds fun, we'll be there with a bottle of wine‚Äù I confirmed with a content sigh.

The stars that night were incredible, an explosion of light painted across the sky. Mandy and I watched them while laying next to each other in the grass. She was curled up against my side, head resting against my chest. I helped her to her feet and led her to our tent where she laid down and fell right to sleep. I stepped out to douse the fire and heard a voice coming from Blake's tent. I crept closer and peaked through the perforated material near the top to see Blake and Cary sitting next to each other.

‚ÄúI like you too...‚Äù I heard Cary whisper.

Blake leaned forward and kissed her awkwardly on the lips. They parted and grinned at each other.

‚ÄúI have to go back before they realize I'm gone,‚Äù she said after a moment.

‚ÄúOkay, but I'll see you tomorrow, right?‚Äù Blake whispered to her.

‚ÄúYou better,‚Äù Cary said with a grin as she stood up to sneak back out.

I hid behind the tent as she left, smiling at the innocence of it all.

Danny would have been proud of him.

No.

Danny will be proud of him.

I next morning, Mandy surprised us by make pancakes and coffee. She had brought a French Press, which was already full of rich, dark coffee wafting through the air as we awoke. She made me jump by appearing right in front of me as I unzipped the door of the tent. I laughed at my own fright as she handed me a coffee cup and kissed my cheek.

‚ÄúOh my God, is that coffee?‚Äù came Sarah from the doorway of her own tent.

‚ÄúIt is, honey, and there's pancakes too!‚Äù Mandy tittered as she poured another cup of coffee.

‚ÄúI like the way this day is starting,‚Äù I said wish a grin.

‚ÄúThen you'll love what we're doing later,‚Äù Mandy said with a sly wink.

‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe're having a picnic. I got a nice bottle of rose' and packed some bread and cheese for us.‚Äù

I took another sip of coffee, once again wondering if this could even be real. I decided I wouldn't question it too much, letting out an audible moan of approval at the quality of the coffee.

After we packed our provisions and hiked out to a little spot on a hill, Mandy and I sprawled on a blanket with a bottle of wine and a basket between us. We sipped and giggled as the light glittered off the tiny waves of the lake in the distance.

‚ÄúJust so you know, I'm really happy with you,‚Äù I suddenly told her.

She wordlessly reached out and held my hand, smiling at me with those perfect eyes.

We laid there watching as the clouds drifted lazily through the sky with our fingers intertwined. I thought back to the Harvest Moon and my sheer panic and horror as I fed a dead body into the well. Here I was after killing a living man and condemning him to the well, and I felt serene. I didn't feel an inkling of guilt. If there ever was any, it had been swallowed up the twin emeralds that shined out from Mandy's eyes.

By the time we got back to the camp, it was already sunset and we could smell the smoke of the Larsons beginning to grill. As promised, Sarah, Blake, Mandy and I arrived with a bottle of wine. Before long, we all sat around the fire, eating and talking.

‚ÄúSo, what do you think of our town so far, Sarah?‚Äù Calvin asked her courteously with a smile.

‚ÄúI like it a lot! I wish we would have come down earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kept you from visiting?‚Äù Jennifer, Calvin's wife, asked.

‚ÄúMostly my husband's job,‚Äù Sarah said, then stopped suddenly, clearly having tripped over small patch of pain she hadn't seen.

‚ÄúYea, Jenny and I heard about what had happened with your husband. We're real sorry to hear about it,‚Äù Calvin said in a sympathetic tone.

‚ÄúThank you. I pray to God everyday that he comes home,‚Äù Sarah added in a voice scarce above a whisper.

‚ÄúWe'll make sure to pray as well. God works miracles everyday,‚Äù came Jennifer's reassurance.

‚ÄúYes, he does,‚Äù Mandy said, looking at Blake with a smile as she did so. ‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.‚Äù

Looking back now, I shudder when I think of her saying that. However, at the time, I smiled at her and enjoyed my food and wine.

The night air was cool but not cold, and as the night wore on, we all entered a comfortable stupor of well fed euphoria and decided to call it a night. Blake and Sarah went to their tents with sleepy smiles on their faces and Mandy and I lounged by the fire.

There, in that moment, I'm pretty sure I was the happiest I had ever been in my entire life. That being said, I can't be certain that it doesn't just seem like that when juxtaposed by the events that came after.

I woke up in the dark. I looked over to where Mandy should have been, but she wasn't there. Feeling confused, I got up and walked to the open door flap of the tent. There was a stillness to the air that felt... wrong. I looked around, but Mandy was nowhere to be seen. As my eyes scanned the dark around the camp for a human form, I noticed Blake's tent was open as well. When I looked into the opening, I could see that Blake was missing too.

I began to get a bad feeling, but pushed it down. I instead walked towards the Larson campsite to see if maybe Mandy and Blake were over there, but when I arrived, I found their tents all empty.

The foreboding sensation boiling in my stomach began to evolve into a blooming sense of dread in my chest. I spent the next few minutes jogging to where I parked the car only to find it gone when I arrived. I tried to ignore what my mind was beginning to put together and began walking.

It was a few miles back to the farm by road, but with cutting through fields and hopping a few fences, I could make it back there in about an hour and a half. Every step I took, my mind began to race faster and faster.

‚ÄúSo, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help,‚Äù I could hear Cal saying.

I walked a bit longer.

‚ÄúThe well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better,‚Äù I could hear Mandy saying in my mind.

I walked faster now, my heart thundering in my chest.

‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle,‚Äù I could hear her saying to Blake now.

I ran the last bit of the way from there. I jumped the fence and entered into the massive cornfield that led up to the farmhouse. The corn pressed in from all sides, but I knew to keep the fence to my left as I followed it up to where I could see firelight dancing in the distance.

The first thing I arrived at was the barn. I crept up to the doors, trying to open them as silently as possible. I could hear voices in the distance, down by where the well sat silent and hungry. I went to pull the door open, but found it locked. It was at that moment that I realized I forgot to grab my keys from the camp.

I crept around the side of the barn until I could see the well and the crowd that had gathered around it. At least three dozen people were holding torches and all facing the well, seemingly waiting for something.

‚ÄúChester...‚Äù I heard a rumbling voice speak from just behind me.

I turned and was relieved to see Otto standing there.

‚ÄúThank God, Otto, we need to do something. I think they're about to sacrifice Blake to the well.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry, Chester, they would never do that. Blake is the next caretaker.‚Äù

My blood froze in my veins and I took an involuntary step backwards.

‚ÄúWhat are you saying... Otto, that can't be what's happening.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe must feed the well, Chester.‚Äù

Otto began to change in front of me. His features became less defined. He still looked like an old man, but there was something else there now too. It was like looking at something with 3D glasses, but the second image was something grotesque. Too many eyes and a mouth that was more of a mandible than anything human.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I shouted and jumped back.

I wasn't fast enough and Otto grabbed both of my arms in his and held me in place. I struggled, but his iron grip held me there.

‚ÄúCome, Chester. Come witness a miracle.‚Äù

He began marching me towards the well, hauling me as I kicked and scrambled uselessly the whole way.

I recognized some of the people gathered there. There was Henry, a regular at the bar. Jordan, the girl who ran the sewing shop in town. Jennifer Larson, who's husband and daughter were noticeably absent.

Oh no.

I realized what was happening them. I looked over to the farmhouse to see Mandy leading Blake towards the well with a hand on either shoulder, the boy beaming with a toothy smile. Behind her was Calvin similarly leading Cary. I twisted hard in Otto's grasp to no avail.

‚ÄúDo you know how long I had endured you grandfather's meager rations? How long the most I could look forward to was a desiccated corpse to be thrown down my gullet?‚Äù He leaned in near me, his voice a low snarl. ‚ÄúDo you know much I've hungered in the dark?‚Äù

I was crying now, tears streaming down my face.

‚ÄúPlease... please, let me go...‚Äù

Otto responded with stony silence as he turned me towards the well and held me in place by my shoulders. I watched as Mandy led Blake to where he could watch. I could hear her as she looked down and spoke to him.

‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.‚Äù

Calvin lifted Cary up and sat her on the edge of the well, giving her a kiss on her forehead. She looked up at him serenely, not a hint of terror on her face. That's when he turned and looked at me expectantly.

‚ÄúYou have to choose, Chester.‚Äù Otto whispered behind me. ‚ÄúYou have to choose to make this trade. Ask for your brother to be returned to you and he shall be.‚Äù

I closed my eyes hard, then opened them and looked into Mandy's green orbs that looked back at me with a smile. I looked back over to Calvin with his face of grim expectation. Finally, I opened my mouth and I spoke.



It's been a while since all that happened. I'm sitting in the airport now, waiting to board my flight, writing this on my laptop. I'm flying back home to the farm after picking up Susan.

I met Susan on a message board about the paranormal. She's only seventeen, but she wants to start her own paranormal YouTube channel. I went out to meet her and we're flying back to the farm so she can research the well.

I told her there's some kind of weird artifact at the bottom of it.

It's wrong, sure, but I'm going to have my brother over soon. He was found a couple weeks ago with amnesia a few towns away. No idea how he got there, and with him having no memory of how it happened, it looked like a mystery that would never be solved. I wasn't able to see the tearful reunion between him and Sarah, but I was definitely happy to hear about it.

It was definitely something Blake needed. After he got back from the camping trip, he had been really quiet and withdrawn, but his dad's reappearance seemed to have brought him out of it.

Sarah just seemed happy to have her family back.

I'm having all three of them as well as a bunch of other guests out over to the farm for the wedding. Mandy and I still haven't decided where we want to go to for our honeymoon, but at least we know the well will be okay in the meantime.

Well, Susan and I are boarding the plane now, so I have to go. She's so happy and bubbly that I almost feel some guilt for what I'm about to do. Almost.

At the end of the day, I have to do what I was always meant to do. I have to feed the well.

And the well shall feed me.",1,1748842018.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False

First and foremost, I am a coward.

I spent every morning for a few weeks waking up on the dusty ground around the well. Those waking moments were the least drunk I'd be during those times. Every sunrise would bring a short period of time when I'd be confronted with the vibrant memory of my brother going over the side of the well. I could almost hear the sounds of feral mastication, every meaty crunch of bones cracking beneath ragged flesh echoing in my mind. I'd push myself up, look down at the empty bottle in my hand, and go inside to resume drinking.

I used to look at the farmhouse as a happy memory. I could still picture Danny and I running around the corn fields and my mother happily watching over us from the porch with our grandparents standing behind her. That happy place had become nothing more to me than a massive tombstone rising up from the ground now. Every step to my front door was haunted by the knowledge of what composed the foundations of this place. The happy memories I once held so dear had been buried alongside so many others within the mass grave I had come to live upon.

Some nights, I'd stumble out into the field, the path to the well lit by the moon like a beacon guiding me into Hell. I'd approach that profane altar and stand poised upon its lip. I'd walk around the edges, bottle in hand while hoping my foot would slip. I'd fantasize about going over the edge only for everything to stop. No more pain. No more shame. I'd balance on a single leg and take a long drink from the bottle of liquor in my hand. I'd drink until the dreamless sleep that I hoped death would be like would overtake me. Then, I'd wake up on the ground, preparing to do it all over again.

This continued, until I woke up before the sunrise one morning, pushed myself up, looked at the empty bottle, then noticed the old man watching me while leaning against that damn well.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I croaked with a half wave before pushing myself up to my feet.

The old man lifted his hand to acknowledge my wave and I got a good look at him. He was large, but not fat, just very broad all around. His ruddy skin was a testament to years spent toiling in fields living the life of a farmhand. He was wearing a flannel shirt buttoned up to his neck as well as a leather jacket over it and faded blue jeans held up by a worn, brown leather belt. I held my hand out as he approached to greet him, and as he gripped my hand, I could feel the myriad of calluses covering his palms like armor.

‚ÄúGood to meet you, Chester,‚Äù he rumbled, his voice much deeper than I had thought it'd be. ‚ÄúYour grandfather told me a lot about you. Sorry to hear he's gone. I'm Otto, your neighbor to the East.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou knew my grandfather?‚Äù I asked dumbly.

‚ÄúYea, I'd look after the well for him now and again. Don't look so shocked, most of us older folk here know about it. We got to be pretty good friends a while back, talked about our families and such. I'm gonna miss him quite a lot.‚Äù

He looked at me and I almost couldn't meet those sky-blue orbs that penetrated right through any facade of nonchalance I could erect. When I finally did force myself to meet his gaze, I couldn't hold it for longer than a split-second before having to glance back at the endless sea of corn stalks swaying in the morning breeze.

‚ÄúSomething on your mind, Chester?‚Äù Otto said in a low, soothing baritone.

I fought the tears, feeling pain creeping up the sides of my face from the strain of forcing my stinging eyes to stay open and dry. There was an awkward silence and the wind became the only sound.

‚ÄúNo, it's nothing, but I appreciate you asking,‚Äù I replied in a series of hoarse stutters after a full three seconds had passed.

Otto laid a hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúI got a nephew like you, about your age too. He always thinks he has to hide what he's going through, like he's embarrassed about it. Yet, in the end, he always opens up to his family. We always help him through it. So don't feel like you have something to gain by keeping your troubles a secret.‚Äù

Maybe it was his kind tone, maybe it was the way he reminded me of Grandpa Silas. Maybe it was the way my head felt like it was going to split in two if I didn't tell someone what was going on. In that moment, I poured out everything to this old man I had only just met. Otto listened too. I told him everything and he let me. The sun was over the horizon by the time I got to the end and finished crying over Daniel's death.

‚ÄúIt took him, Otto. The well. I don't know how to get him back. I don't know how to make it right,‚Äù I whispered shakily while wiping the tears from my dirt covered cheeks onto my dirt covered sleeves.

‚ÄúWhen my nephew was really young, he convinced his parents to adopt this dog he found off the streets. The dog was fairly small and well behaved, so my sister and her husband agreed to hold onto the dog until the owners arrived. It soon became apparent that the dog was pregnant. So when the time came for the puppies, four were born and my nephew was instantly smitten by them. However, he didn't understand that puppies were fragile. He handled one a little rough and broke the poor things neck.‚Äù

The way Otto spoke was hypnotic, the story transfixing me so well that, for a moment, I forgot about my own pains and could only think of the poor dog.

‚ÄúThe dog died immediately, and my nephew was quite distraught. He felt guilty knowing his carelessness had facilitated that tragedy. However, guilt is our mind telling us to act in some way. So I gave him an act to do. I told him that he needed to take care of the other puppies for the rest of their lives. Feed them, walk them, love them. That's how he makes it right. So your brother, you say he has a wife and child? Maybe you can start making it right by helping them.‚Äù

I sniffed back tears and, for the first time in weeks, the weight crushing my chest lifted allowing me to breath. For the first time since Danny went down the well, I felt like I had direction. It wasn't strong enough to be called hope, but it was something. I thanked the old man and gave him a hug.

‚ÄúDon't worry about it, young man. Though, now that you mention it, if I could borrow your tractor, I'll bring it back tomorrow morning.‚Äù

I laughed and said ‚ÄúThat's no problem. So you used to help my grandfather with the well?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yea, I wasn't the only one. There was a whole group of folks that did, at one point. They called themselves the Wishers. Some of the business owners in town are part of them. I don't really know too much about them though, I started helping your grand dad after he stopped allowing them onto his property. I never asked him too many questions about it, but he seemed to have some kind of problem with them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are they now?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey're mostly business owners in town. The only one I can remember off hand is Amanda, the lady who owns the bar. The ocean-themed one.‚Äù

I had no idea what he was talking about, but made a mental note of it for the next time I was out there. He then thanked me for loaning him my tractor and I went inside the farmhouse where I could hear the phone ringing.

I picked it up and was greeted by my mother. She had been calling a lot since Danny went missing. Talking to her was always painful, but the idea of her suffering without my support was even worse.

‚ÄúI think I have an idea of what happened to Danny!‚Äù she shouted into the receiver.

Her tone was that peculiar sound of forced elation that can only be born of the desperation lying just beneath it.

‚ÄúOh? What's that mom?‚Äù  
‚ÄúHe always loved camping, right? He'd joke about running off to live in the woods all the time. I think he did it, Chester! He could be out there, in the woods, just taking some time for himself... That's what I like to think, that he's out there and happy, just taking some time for himself before coming home. Do you think that could be where he is?‚Äù

As she talked, her voice became less excited and more dreamy. That is, until she asked for my participation in the delusion. It was a kind of bargaining we do so often with reality, pleading for tragedy to be replaced by compromise. In my mother's case, she could stomach her son going missing, so long as she didn't have to believe he was dead. She asked me in a pleading voice and I couldn't help but think I would do the same as her if I wasn't cursed with having seen exactly what happened to my only brother.

I blinked the tears out of my eyes and hunched over, keeping myself steady by placing a hand against the wall and fighting to stay strong for my mother.

‚ÄúYea, mom. I could definitely see that,‚Äù I said calmly while sitting on the floor and wrapping my arms around my knees that were firmly pressed to my chest.

‚ÄúI had another dream about him last night, you know? I was at the farmhouse, watching you two play around in the corn field. You grandpa Silas was there too, hollering to stay away from the old well. Now grandpa Silas is gone and your brother-‚Äù

Her voice cracked for a moment and I realized that my mother, miles away on the other side of the phone, was being strong for me right now. That realization filled me with such shame that I had to bite my lip to avoid whimpering. I tasted blood by the time I recovered.

‚ÄúIt's okay, mom. He could be out there, sitting by a campfire right now, or fishing. It could be a lot of things. I'm sure he'll turn up,‚Äù I lied.

‚ÄúYou're right, sweetie. Sorry, I just miss him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do too, mom.‚Äù

That last part was the truth. The fact that we had grown so distant was painful before I had killed him. Knowing that I could never repair that relationship was almost as bad as knowing I had been the one to rob myself of that chance.

After I got off the phone, I crept upstairs and pulled my brother's phone out of my nightstand drawer to look at the lock-screen picture of us as children. It was at that moment that I remembered Otto's advice and texted Sarah. It started with a simple ‚Äúhow're you doing?‚Äù and became a solid stream of conversation. We would recount memories that we'd share with one another about Danny, or talking about how Blake was doing or simply offering support.

Blake looked a lot like his dad in the pictures that Sarah would send me. At twelve years old, every picture of him that Sarah sent me could have been a picture of my brother at that age. It hurt a little to look at those pictures, but it was also comforting. Before I knew it, I was asking Sarah about my nephew pretty often.

At first, it was clear that she was a proud parent, but it slowly became apparent that it was more than that. Blake was her last link in this world to Danny. Blake was the only piece of him left in her life now. So it should come as no surprise that she was becoming increasingly worried as Blake became more withdrawn.

‚ÄúI still don't know what I was thinking, Otto,‚Äù I was saying a few days later, sitting on my front porch drinking coffee with my neighbor while he listened to my woes. ‚ÄúI didn't think she'd actually say yes to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou still haven't told me what you've done,‚Äù Otto grumbled, clearly wanting me to stop holding back and get to the point of my story. ‚ÄúYou said she was saying she was worried about Blake and thought he needed to get a change of scenery for a little bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYea, and I told her she's always welcome to come over here for a visit!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's actually not a bad idea. This could be your best chance to find some closure. Helping your sister-in-law and your nephew to grieve, well, maybe it can help you with your guilt,‚Äù Otto said slowly in a voice that you could feel as much as hear.

‚ÄúWhat about the well? Isn't it dangerous to have people around it?‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn't your grandfather have you and your brother come to visit all the time as kids? What did he do when you two came over?‚Äù

I actually hadn't thought about this before and was stumped. I never saw him go feed the well when we were visiting. I'd of known, I used to get up and help him with the different jobs to do around the farm every morning, back when I used to want to be a farmer and before I was forced into being one by fate and circumstance. God certainly has a sense of irony.

‚ÄúI have no idea what he did, but you said there was a group of people who used to help him, right? Maybe they would know?‚Äù  
‚ÄúMaybe, but I need to get back to my farm. I'll be back by tomorrow morning to talk if you'd like.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Otto. I'll talk to you in the morning. You can borrow my tractor if you need to, by the way.‚Äù

Otto gave a smirk and a half wave, then walked down the long driveway towards his land. I figured I'd go into town and get a few things if Sarah was coming over. Truthfully, I didn't feel ready to face the woman I had widowed and the child who's father I had murdered. The mere thought of it made me want to vomit, but that didn't matter. They were hurting and I could help them hurt a little less. It wouldn't bring Danny back, but maybe it could help me hurt a little less too.

I went inside to grab my car keys and was about to leave, relishing the feeling of slight optimism stirring inside me, that small sensation that was whispering in the back of my mind... that maybe... just maybe... life could go on.

That's when I heard the well screaming.

After feeding the well, I was on the road, speeding towards town to do some grocery shopping, load up on feed and enjoy access to the internet for a little while. Trees flew past either side of me as I wound my way towards the small patch of civilization nestled into the rolling fields of farmland.

I knew I was approaching the town when I saw the water tower stretching up on the right side of the road, the town name written across it. Just after the water tower is a huge hill, the town just on the other side of it. When you get to the top of the hill, you can see the little town in its entirety. It's actually a really pretty view and I always hesitate for a moment at the top of the hill, taking in the scene before flying down the asphalt ramp in front of me.

Once in town, I ran my errands, only hesitating in front of the liquor store for a moment before driving on and choosing to be sober for Sarah and Blake's visit. I felt rather proud of myself for that. In fact, I felt so proud, that I decided I deserved to have a few drinks before heading home. Sure, I had some groceries in the car, but I had bought a couple bags of ice to toss over them while I took my time. The hard part was finding a bar. I drove around slowly, keeping a wary eye open and finding nothing. I was about to give up when I turned the corner to see a sign that read ‚ÄúThe Port Hole‚Äù that featured a little tugboat pulling the ‚Äúe‚Äù at the end. I turned in and parked in front of the bar which only had three other cars in the parking lot.

I was walking towards the door while looking up at the sign when I remembered Otto talking about how the only Wisher he could remember was the one that owned a nautical themed bar. What had he said her name was? Amanda.

My hand pushed against worn wood and the door swung open revealing the dark interior inside. I stepped onto the wooden planks of the floor and closed the door behind me, waiting for my eyes to adjust. The life preservers on the walls were the first thing I noticed, along with the anchors and nets and all manner of random things one might associate with a boat. In the center of a the bar was a large ship-wheel, like something out a pirate movie, with the logo of a different beer on each arm of the wheel. The top of the bar was reminiscent of ship railing, and a black haired woman wearing a knee length skirt with a matching red blouse was leaned over it with a cloth to wipe it down. She looked up as I approached, fixing those green eyes onto mine and giving me a smile.

I realized that this must be Amanda, but she looked much younger than I had anticipated. She definitely wasn't that young, but she was no older than forty at the most. I had expected someone my grandfather's age, well into their seventies or eighties. That was the first surprise I received from Amanda.

In those precious few moments I had while walking to the bar, my mind blurred with a series of thoughts. Firstly, Amanda most likely had a falling out with my grandfather, so it would probably be best if I didn't tell her who I was. I could just say that I'm here to move in with my uncle. Wait, who's my uncle? Otto. Otto's my uncle. And I'm just here to get a drink. Should I mention the well? No, not yet. I'll have to do this a few times. Maybe in a week or two of coming up here every other day or so, I'll get close enough to mention it, see how she reacts. I have to get close to her first. Okay, I'll slowly get close to her and then I'll learn her secrets. Wait, I don't have time to-

All that went through my head before I sat down in front of her, deciding that I at least knew to introduce myself as Otto's nephew and could figure out the rest as I went.

‚ÄúHi, Chester, nice to finally meet you,‚Äù she greeted me in a sultry voice that matched her smirk.

Fuck.

‚ÄúGood to meet you as well, uh...‚Äù

‚ÄúMandy. I own the bar here. I heard you had taken over your grandfather's farm,‚Äù she said nonchalantly while wiping a glass and not even looking at me.

She came off as smug and arrogant, as if everything I was doing was both mildly amusing and at risk of becoming boring. I immediately didn't like her. I think that fact that I was also immediately attracted to her made it even worse.

‚ÄúYea, we thought it best to keep the farm in the family,‚Äù I replied with a concerted effort to keep the annoyance I felt from creeping into my voice.

‚ÄúOf course, that farm has been with your family since... well, I think your grandfather's grandfather, or something like that,‚Äù she said while filling up a glass with beer.

‚ÄúYea, something like...‚Äù I said, involuntarily shuddering at the thought of how long this ravenous pit has been tormenting my family.

She sat the beer in front of me and suddenly, I was trying to repress the urge to look down while also fighting not to be lost in those green gems that almost seemed to glow in the dim light of this shit-hole bar.

‚ÄúIt's on the house,‚Äù she said with a wink.

Something told me that while I may not be giving her money for this drink, it was far from free. Still, I was thirsty, and was coming up on the longest I had been sober since my brother's death.

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I muttered and took a drink, trying to pull my mind away from the image of my brother vanishing into the maw of a monster, and instead trying to think of how to broach the subject of the well with her.

‚ÄúSo, you're the new caretaker of the well, huh?‚Äù

Or maybe she'd beat me to it, I thought while trying to keep the look of shock from my face. Those eyes had me fixed in place now, Mandy's black hair softly brushing the counter as she leaned in closer to me. I could hear my heart beating in my ears now, but I forced myself to speak.

‚ÄúYea, I guess so. It still surprises me that so many people here know about it,‚Äù I said, taking another gulp of the beer to calm myself.

‚ÄúIt used to be a lot more than your grandfather who watched over that well...‚Äù she said in a cryptic and conspiratorial whisper that was almost... seductive.

‚ÄúWere you one of the Wishers?‚Äù I whispered.

She smiled and leaned in until her otherworldly eyes were all I could see. She smelled like almonds and honey.

‚ÄúHoney, I was¬†*the*¬†Wisher.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat exactly did¬†*the*¬†Wisher do?‚Äù

She leaned back sharply, giving me the smallest of reprieves before contorting her face in a pouting expression.

‚ÄúWe helped Silas with the well, and in return, we also got to use it.‚Äù

Her tone was vindictively playful. She knew she was giving a starving man breadcrumbs... and not just in terms of information.

‚ÄúWait, use it? I thought it just made the corn grow?‚Äù I replied evenly as my frustration only continued to eat away at me.

She leaned back in towards me again, locking me into her hypnotic gaze once again. She followed this with a wink and tapped her nose three times.

‚ÄúIt can do a lot more than that, Chester... A lot more...‚Äù she whispered, the last part directly into my ear.

I was simultaneously filled with a need to know more and the undeniable sensation that I was nearing an unseen danger. The first feeling won out and I pushed a little further.

‚ÄúMaybe you can help me. I have some family coming for a visit and I couldn't help but realize my grandfather never fed the well while my brother and I were visiting him. How did he do that?‚Äù

I hoped by ignoring that she was flirting with me that she'd stop, but to both my pleasure and my dread, she was undeterred.

‚ÄúThere's ways to keep the well satiated for a while. Of course, everything the well gives must be purchased with flesh. That's why the Wishers came about...‚Äù she continued to whisper, forcing me to lean closer to hear her.

I waited for her to say more, but instead, she let the moment draw out with us face to face like that. It was the closest I had been to a woman in a while, and I couldn't help but wonder how it would feel to kiss her.

‚ÄúDo you think you could teach me more about the well?‚Äù I asked, finally matching her tone and playing her game.

Her lips curled into a full grin and she was whispering in my ear again.

‚ÄúI'd love to, but this isn't a good time. I could always drop by tomorrow morning though, if that's okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds perfect. I'll see you then,‚Äù I whispered back, my heart thumping in my ears.

I finished my drink after that, knocking back the rest in one smooth gulp, and started to head back towards the farm. I was full of the strangest blend of foreboding and anticipation, fearing and yearning to trapped alone with Mandy's surreal gaze.

When I got back home, the sun was setting in the distance, painting the countryside in hues of gold and amber beneath a sky the color of flames. I could see the black silhouette of the well squatting in the field next to the farmhouse, looking like a small temple of dark stones. No, that's not quite it. It looked like a sacrificial altar awaiting the next victim.

The next morning, I woke up to knocking on the door. I wandered down the stairs, pulling on a shirt as I did so. I was expecting Mandy's petite frame standing in the doorway, but when I swung open the door, it was Otto's broad form filling the porch.

‚ÄúGood morning, Chester! Just wanted to check on you and make sure you're were doing okay,‚Äù he said in a voice that one could feel vibrating in their chest.

‚ÄúI'm doing pretty good, though I'm glad you stopped by. I had a question,‚Äù I responded while gesturing for him to come inside.

‚ÄúIf it's about the tractor, I planned to put more gas in it today,‚Äù he said while taking a seat at the kitchen table and looking a little sheepish.

‚ÄúWhat? Never mind, that's not what this is about. Do you remember you mentioning the Wishers? I found Amanda, she said she's teach me more about the well.‚Äù

Otto gave me a serious look.

‚ÄúAre you sure that's a good idea, Ches? Your grandfather seemed to have had some kind of issue with them.‚Äù

‚ÄúBelieve me, I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but this Mandy woman seems to know something. I can't take a chance on Sarah and Blake getting hurt when they come to visit.‚Äù

Otto considered this for a moment and then nodded his head in agreement.

‚ÄúJust be careful, Ches. If anything happens, just know that you can always call on me for help,‚Äù Otto rumbled, standing up as he did so.

‚ÄúThanks, Otto. I'm glad to have you hear. It means a lot.‚Äù

He didn't say a word, just placed a large hand on my shoulder and gave me a knowing smile, then headed out the door.

I wish I could say that I sat down and thought about the risks I had been too stupid to realize that I had been taking, or that I had taken a moment to consider the people I was putting in danger, but I didn't. Instead, I went and shaved and groomed my hair, unable to stop my mind from wandering to Mandy's plump lips and raven hair.

Just as I finished, I heard the sound of tires crunching on the gravel road outside the house and was down the stairs just as the first knock came. I opened the door and grinned like an idiot at the Mandy who was wearing skin tight blue jeans coupled a white dress shirt with the top three buttons left undone.

‚ÄúWow, it looks just the same as it did the last time I saw it...‚Äù she muttered with a far away look on her face as she scanned every inch of the room she was stepping into.

It took me a moment to realize she was talking about the farm which had the strange quality of being seemingly frozen in time.

‚ÄúI thought the same thing too when I got here,‚Äù I muttered absentmindedly while gesturing for her to follow me inside.

We sat at the kitchen table and once again, I was confronted with the honey and almond smell of her perfume. She smiled and leaned forward across the table, fixing me with that supernatural gaze.

‚ÄúSo, you want to know about the well?‚Äù she said with a crooked smile after a moments pause.

‚ÄúI would¬†*love*¬†to know about the well,‚Äù I replied, matching her tone.

‚ÄúWhat do you want more than anything in the world, Chester?‚Äù she asked excitedly.

You, I thought.

‚ÄúTo have my brother back.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd call me Ches.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe well can do a lot of things... Ches,‚Äù she said with a heavy emphasis on my name that made my head spin. ‚ÄúIt's just a matter of what you're willing to pay for it. Flesh is its currency, and the bigger the dream, the more flesh to pay.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does this have to do with keeping the well quiet for a week or two?‚Äù I asked, confused.

She narrowed her eyes and leaned forward a little more, closing the gap between us and making my mind fog over again.

‚ÄúThe well is meant to grant wishes. If you let someone make a big enough wish, the well will go silent for a while. But it has to be a big wish.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, so I throw a few pounds of meat down the well and wish for my brother back. I'll throw a whole cow down there if I have to-‚Äù

‚ÄúThat's not how it works, Ches,‚Äù she said, placing a finger on my lips to shush me. I wanted to be mad about it so bad, but... I was entranced.

‚ÄúThe well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better.‚Äù

My blood ran cold and the spell was broken. I jumped up so fast that I knocked the chair I was sitting in over in the process. The full reality of what she was talking about settled over me, making me feel sick.

‚ÄúAre you suggesting we kill children?!‚Äù I screamed.

Mandy suddenly looked irritated.

‚ÄúDon't be like your grandfather, Ches! Babies die in nature all the time. Don't you realize you could have anything you like? You could have your brother back, you could be rich, you could be young forever! Think you about it! Every dream you've ever had, they can all come true! What kind of price would you pay to have every dream you ever had be a reality?‚Äù

‚ÄúBabies? Mandy, do you hear yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't be an idiot, Ches. Your grandfather started off with the occasional prisoner in the town jail, but even if he never admitted it, those prisoners got younger and younger each time...‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're lying...‚Äù I stuttered, my words falling flat without the force of conviction behind them.

‚ÄúNo, Ches, I'm not,‚Äù she growled darkly, standing and beginning the step around the table to close the distance between us.

‚ÄúI can't believe that grandpa Silas would be okay with such a thing...‚Äù I heard myself saying, more a plea to my own ears and than any sort of a rebuttal.

‚ÄúChester... you're not thinking about it. You could have¬†*anything*¬†you want. What would you not give to have your brother back?‚Äù

She had slipped back into a seductive and sympathetic whisper, and as much as I hate to admit it, the words found their mark. I looked down at the floor, too ashamed to lift my face any higher as I felt Mandy step in even closer, the smell of almonds and honey enveloping me again.

‚ÄúWhat would I have to do?‚Äù I breathed as I felt her arms slide up and around my neck.

‚ÄúOnly that what you're meant to do,‚Äù I heard her say as her face filled my vision, her ghostly green eyes burrowing into me.

‚ÄúWhat was I meant to do?‚Äù I muttered over the sound of my beating heart.

She leaned in until her lips were brushing my ear and I already knew the words she would utter before they left her mouth.

Over the course of the next week, Mandy spent more and more time at the farmhouse. By the weekend, she had practically moved in. I felt like I was engaging in some shameful and depraved act of perversion, but like an addict, I continued to indulge. There was something about the way Mandy would look at me that made it impossible to even think of saying the word ‚Äúno.‚Äù

Each time I began to consider the horror of what she was putting into motion, I would picture my brother going over the edge of the well. That's how I ended up sitting at my kitchen table while Mandy talked with the sheriff over the phone. Apparently, he was a Wisher too.

I tried my best to ignore what was taking place with my consent. I failed miserably in that endeavor.

Mandy had arranged a prisoner to be brought up to the farm under the guise of a work-release program. I closed my eyes and forced myself to not think about what would happen this evening. I failed at that as well.

Mandy must have sensed this, because after she hung up the phone, she walked to where I was to lift my chin up with a gentle push of her index finger and kissed me deeply. It was almost supernatural how the words entered my mind as she pressed against me.

I suppose if it's just criminals...

I knew it was only the first of many rationalizations I would have to make. Still, I let myself be drawn into it. As she pulled away, I only barely registered that I was condemning a man to die.

Life with Mandy was dream-like. After the months of solitude, waking with her by my side didn't feel quite real. I'd reach out and brush my fingers along her black hair, pulling the strands from her ivory shoulders and watch as she'd smile in her sleep. If this was a dream, I never wanted to wake from it.

I'd wake up early and have coffee with her as she would get ready to leave for the bar. Not long after she left, Otto would appear and talk for a while. I didn't have the courage to tell him what Mandy was doing, but he also didn't ask. Instead, he'd tell me how much happier I looked and that he was looking forward to meeting Sarah and Blake when they came to visit.

I'm ashamed to admit it, but Otto was right. I was happier. Even talking with my mother had become easier. When she'd hold out hope that Danny might come back someday, I found myself smiling and thinking that he actually might. Mandy had told me that I could have anything I wanted so long as I was willing to provide the flesh the Well would desire as its price. More and more, that price didn't seem as steep as it had.

When the evening came that day, Mandy and I were waiting in the driveway as the sheriff pulled up in his SUV. He tipped his hat to Mandy and I, and even though he was wearing sunglasses, I was sure I saw a wink. He then went to the back of the vehicle and led out a man that couldn't have been older than twenty. The sheriff held the young man by his handcuffs as he walked him towards where Mandy and I were standing. We wordlessly turned and began leading the way to the Well.

‚ÄúI just want to say that I appreciate the opportunity to-‚Äù the young man began to say nervously, only to be cut off by the sheriff's sharp voice.

‚ÄúNo need to talk, son. They're about to go over orientation. Better listen up.‚Äù

I realized this was my cue and swallowed hard before speaking.

‚ÄúDon't worry, it's an easy job. We had some damage to the interior of this well and just needed someone to get lowered down to repair the masonry. It won't take long.‚Äù

We arrived at the well just as I finished speaking, a contraption of wood and cable suspended above it. It was a simple pulley system I had rigged up the night before. There was a hand crank at the base of the structure which would either draw a cable up or down depending on the way you moved it. At the end of the cable was a harness held in place by a metal spring-clip.

After he had his handcuffs removed, the young man nervously pulled it towards himself and put it on while the sheriff, Mandy and myself watched him wordlessly. After he had pulled the last strap tight around his thigh, he looked out at us expectantly.

‚ÄúOkay, go ahead and step into the well,‚Äù Mandy urged with a pleasant smile.

The young man suddenly looked confused.

‚ÄúWhere's the tools?‚Äù

Oh shit.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù asked Mandy, the pleasant smile suddenly replaced by irritated confusion.

‚ÄúYou want me to go down there and fix something, right? Where's the tools? I don't see any around here. It's just strange is all,‚Äù he he said slowly, eyes going from one person to the next and a look of trepidation darkening his features.

In response to this, the sheriff pulled his pistol from his holster with a slow and deliberate movement accompanied with an irritated sigh. He pulled back the slide chambering a round as the young man flinched backwards and began to take breaths in rapid secession.

‚ÄúCome on, don't do this! I just took some stuff! Pleas don't do this!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa, calm down! The tools are down there already, there's no need to freak out, okay?‚Äù I heard myself saying as I lifted my arms with my pams out in a disarming gesture.

The kid seemed to calm down a little, turning towards the well while the sheriff lowered his gun. The kid let go of the side of the well and was hanging over it, nervous sweat beading on his forehead.

‚ÄúOkay, so I just go down there and fix the well, right?‚Äù

I smiled at him, my hand reaching past the lever of the pulley system and instead grabbing the clip joining the harness to the cable.

‚ÄúThat's right kid. You're gonna fix the well.‚Äù I said reassuringly while my stomach churned.

I pressed down on the release and the clip came away with a loud snap. For just a moment, the kid's face contorted into a look of desperate terror as he sucked in air to prepare for a scream that never came. His gasp echoed up from the dark only to be followed by a meaty crunch. Then another. And another.

I stood there, bracing for the realization of what I had just done to settle over me with its totality, but the shock never came. Instead, I felt only relief mixed with cold acceptance.

When I finally did turn away, I saw Mandy and the sheriff both kneeling upon one knee with their heads down. Mandy was the first to lift her face up towards mine, her green eyes shining with renewed vigor. I had thought she was was in her forties, but the woman before me looked ten years younger than that. She stood to her feet and wrapped her arms around my waist with a coy smile.

‚ÄúHow many more,‚Äù I said, burying my face into her shoulder.

She laid a hand across the back of my head, her dark embrace a more complete oblivion than even the liquor could afford me. She pulled me in with those slow and deliberate movements, each smooth action reminiscent of a languid wave washing ashore... or a snake caressing its prey.

‚ÄúAs many as it takes, my love. As many as it takes for your dream to come true.‚Äù

I finally embraced her back, having made up my mind. After all, if it's just criminals that are being killed...

Sarah and Blake arrived a couple days after that. I picked them up from the airport with Mandy riding in the passenger seat. It was a three hour long drive back into the countryside, so we had plenty of time to get to know one another. I had been a little nervous that things might be awkward, but to my relief, it was the most normal moment I've had since I got the phone call about grandpa Silas's stroke all those months ago.

Sarah and Blake were standing next to the parking area as we pulled up. I got out and helped with their luggage, getting a good look at the two of them as I did so. Sarah had blonde hair that fell almost to her waist laced with a few streaks of premature gray. She bore the weight of the last few months admirably, but the wear of such exertion was clear upon her face in the dark rings beneath her eyes.

Blake stayed close to his mother, regarding me with a shy curiosity. When he met Mandy, that shy curiosity gave away to outright infatuation. He sat just behind her in the car, completely drawn in as Mandy described the veritable feast she would be preparing once we arrived home. She would look back at him and smile occasionally, those bright green eyes flaring with infectious excitement as she described the fun he'd have fishing and camping.

‚ÄúCamping sounds amazing, I haven't done that in years,‚Äù Sarah sighed from the backseat.

‚ÄúIt's going to be great, there's a really cool campsite the town uses,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere's lots of families up there this time of year, it's a lot of fun.‚Äù

I saw Blake grinning ear to ear through the rear view mirror and laid my hand on Mandy's knee. I felt her hand slide over the top of mine and give it a squeeze.

We pulled up to the farmhouse as the sun was beginning to set. I walked behind everyone else with the bags and glanced towards the silhouette of the well standing black against the waning light of the sun, the pulley system looking like gallows, and realized that this was the longest I'd gone without feeding it since I had come here. I smiled and followed the others inside.

Blake was falling asleep before we had even finished dinner and was already snoring upstairs as Mandy uncorked a bottle of red wine. She settled in at the table with the bottle and three glasses and began to pour.

‚ÄúSo how'd you two meet?‚Äù Sarah asked as the ruby liquid splashed from the bottle into a glass.

‚ÄúIt's actually really cute,‚Äù Mandy began. ‚ÄúDo you believe in fate?‚Äù

To her credit, Sarah didn't roll her eyes, though I wouldn't have blamed her if she had.

‚ÄúI'm not sure if I do or not, but I'm listening,‚Äù she said with an amused grin.

‚ÄúWell, Ches would come in every now and again when he was in town, but never really talked much. So, one day, I decide I'm going to flirt with him.‚Äù

Sarah snorted a little and Mandy gave me a wry smirk. I could tell she was enjoying telling this story she had invented.

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù Sarah prompted with another laugh.

‚ÄúI walk over to where he's sitting at the bar and tell him he looks like the first boy I ever kissed when I was eleven years old, and he looks at me like I'm crazy, but now I have his attention.‚Äù

She paused to take a sip of wine dramatically, masterfully building the tension. She finished and sat the glass down, turning to me to act out her next scene of the story.

‚ÄúYou know you never forget your first kiss, right? What was yours like?‚Äù She asked with exaggerated innocence and femininity, then dropped her voice into a mimic of my own. ‚ÄúMy first kiss happened not far from here at the lake where everyone goes camping. ‚ÄúI was visiting my grandpa and met a girl up there over the weekend. On the last day, I finally got up the courage to kiss her by the lake.‚Äù

She paused again, looking at me adoringly and slipping her hand into mine, all the teasing and mimicry melting from her voice as it filled with emotion.

‚ÄúI told him that's crazy, because that's exactly how I had my first kiss with old man Silas's grandson...‚Äù

I smiled at Mandy, staring deep into those implacable green eyes as she squeezed my hand. The story was a complete falsehood, pure fiction with no other purpose than to explain our meeting. Still, I lost myself in that fiction. I lost myself in Mandy's dream.

Sarah smiled at us fondly, then broke into crying with a sudden gasp.

‚ÄúI'm sorry, I don't mean to-‚Äù

Mandy was already on her feet, an arm around Sarah's shoulders as she told her not to worry.

‚ÄúIt's just the wine, honey, it's okay,‚Äù Mandy soothed.

‚ÄúI know, I just miss him...‚Äù Sarah whispered, turning to look into my eyes. ‚ÄúI know you miss him too, Ches.‚Äù

I nodded and laid my hand on her shoulder, unable to hold her gaze. I tried not to think of the fact that she was trying to comfort me, the man who had killed her husband. The only thing that allowed me to withstand that thought was the belief that I could also be the man who returned him to her.

The next day, we left for the campsite. I left the barn door open for Otto, in case he needed to borrow the tractor, and left to enjoy a week out at the lake. We had brought tents, fishing poles, food and about a dozen bottles of wine to enjoy over the next week. We all piled into the car and started on the short drive, no more than a few miles away.

We crested the final hill and could see Lake Meder in the distance, reflecting the brilliance of the sun upon its gentle waters. There was already a good number of tents around it and a few small boats on the water with fishing poles bristling over the sides.

We parked and retrieved all our gear to begin walking to our camping spot. On the way there, we passed families setting up their own tents, playing with frisbees or just sitting around their campsites. As we got closer to the water, we could see lots of kids Blake's age all playing on the beach or swimming.

‚ÄúCan I go swimming, mom?‚Äù Blake asked excitedly.

‚ÄúAfter you set up your tent. Where else are you gonna change into your bathing suit?‚Äù Sarah responded with a laugh.

We got to our spot and started setting up tents and unpacking gear. A short distance away was a family doing the same. There was a man and woman as well as a little girl about Blake's age. The man had a large build and dark brown hair. I recognized him from town as Calvin Larson, one of the managers of the feed store. I'd talked with him a few times and deduced that the woman must be his wife, Jennifer, and the little girl would be his daughter, Cary. I waved and smiled at them, prompting them to do the same.

For the first time since I had arrived in this place, I actually felt like I belonged in that moment.

We finished setting up the campsite and Blake wasted no time in changing into swimming trunks and running down to the lake. Sarah looked at Mandy and smiled.

‚ÄúThank you guys for this. It means a lot. It's the first time I've seen him this happy since his father disappeared.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thank you for being here,‚Äù Mandy said, giving Sarah a hug. ‚ÄúYou two don't even realize how much we wanted to have you here.‚Äù

I let Mandy and Sarah have their moment. I decided I would go down to the lake and fish off the dock. I had my rod and reel in one hand and my tackle box in the other as I followed the little trail that ran down from the hill we had camped on. I arrived at the dock and flicked my rod through the air, hearing the satisfying splash of my baited hook hit the water as I sat down.

I had been sitting out there for a few minutes when I heard foot steps echoing on the wooden planks of the dock. I looked up to see Calvin Larson walking towards me with his own rod and reel.

‚ÄúHi there, neighbor!‚Äù he exclaimed with a cheerful smile.

‚ÄúHey Cal, you're fishing too, huh?‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúWell, I hope to, but I'm gonna have to borrow some bait. I don't have any in my tackle box. I can trade for it though,‚Äù he said as he drew near, setting his tackle box on the dock and opening to reveal it had been filled with ice and beer.

‚ÄúI think we can make a deal,‚Äù I laughed, grinning at him.

We cracked a couple cans of beer and sat there on the dock, lines in the water and the sun shining overhead.

‚ÄúSo, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help.‚Äù

I looked at Calvin with a raised eyebrow. I had ceased to be shocked by locals knowing about the worst kept secret in town.

‚ÄúThat's good to know, Cal. Seriously, it's appreciated,‚Äù I answered him and took another sip of beer.

From where we sat, we could see Cary and Blake swimming in the lake. I smiled, remembering how Danny and I would play out here as kids.

‚ÄúI think it's going to be a fun week,‚Äù Calvin said next to me. ‚ÄúThe wife and I are going to grill tomorrow night. You'll have to bring everyone over.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds fun, we'll be there with a bottle of wine‚Äù I confirmed with a content sigh.

The stars that night were incredible, an explosion of light painted across the sky. Mandy and I watched them while laying next to each other in the grass. She was curled up against my side, head resting against my chest. I helped her to her feet and led her to our tent where she laid down and fell right to sleep. I stepped out to douse the fire and heard a voice coming from Blake's tent. I crept closer and peaked through the perforated material near the top to see Blake and Cary sitting next to each other.

‚ÄúI like you too...‚Äù I heard Cary whisper.

Blake leaned forward and kissed her awkwardly on the lips. They parted and grinned at each other.

‚ÄúI have to go back before they realize I'm gone,‚Äù she said after a moment.

‚ÄúOkay, but I'll see you tomorrow, right?‚Äù Blake whispered to her.

‚ÄúYou better,‚Äù Cary said with a grin as she stood up to sneak back out.

I hid behind the tent as she left, smiling at the innocence of it all.

Danny would have been proud of him.

No.

Danny will be proud of him.

I next morning, Mandy surprised us by make pancakes and coffee. She had brought a French Press, which was already full of rich, dark coffee wafting through the air as we awoke. She made me jump by appearing right in front of me as I unzipped the door of the tent. I laughed at my own fright as she handed me a coffee cup and kissed my cheek.

‚ÄúOh my God, is that coffee?‚Äù came Sarah from the doorway of her own tent.

‚ÄúIt is, honey, and there's pancakes too!‚Äù Mandy tittered as she poured another cup of coffee.

‚ÄúI like the way this day is starting,‚Äù I said wish a grin.

‚ÄúThen you'll love what we're doing later,‚Äù Mandy said with a sly wink.

‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe're having a picnic. I got a nice bottle of rose' and packed some bread and cheese for us.‚Äù

I took another sip of coffee, once again wondering if this could even be real. I decided I wouldn't question it too much, letting out an audible moan of approval at the quality of the coffee.

After we packed our provisions and hiked out to a little spot on a hill, Mandy and I sprawled on a blanket with a bottle of wine and a basket between us. We sipped and giggled as the light glittered off the tiny waves of the lake in the distance.

‚ÄúJust so you know, I'm really happy with you,‚Äù I suddenly told her.

She wordlessly reached out and held my hand, smiling at me with those perfect eyes.

We laid there watching as the clouds drifted lazily through the sky with our fingers intertwined. I thought back to the Harvest Moon and my sheer panic and horror as I fed a dead body into the well. Here I was after killing a living man and condemning him to the well, and I felt serene. I didn't feel an inkling of guilt. If there ever was any, it had been swallowed up the twin emeralds that shined out from Mandy's eyes.

By the time we got back to the camp, it was already sunset and we could smell the smoke of the Larsons beginning to grill. As promised, Sarah, Blake, Mandy and I arrived with a bottle of wine. Before long, we all sat around the fire, eating and talking.

‚ÄúSo, what do you think of our town so far, Sarah?‚Äù Calvin asked her courteously with a smile.

‚ÄúI like it a lot! I wish we would have come down earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kept you from visiting?‚Äù Jennifer, Calvin's wife, asked.

‚ÄúMostly my husband's job,‚Äù Sarah said, then stopped suddenly, clearly having tripped over small patch of pain she hadn't seen.

‚ÄúYea, Jenny and I heard about what had happened with your husband. We're real sorry to hear about it,‚Äù Calvin said in a sympathetic tone.

‚ÄúThank you. I pray to God everyday that he comes home,‚Äù Sarah added in a voice scarce above a whisper.

‚ÄúWe'll make sure to pray as well. God works miracles everyday,‚Äù came Jennifer's reassurance.

‚ÄúYes, he does,‚Äù Mandy said, looking at Blake with a smile as she did so. ‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.‚Äù

Looking back now, I shudder when I think of her saying that. However, at the time, I smiled at her and enjoyed my food and wine.

The night air was cool but not cold, and as the night wore on, we all entered a comfortable stupor of well fed euphoria and decided to call it a night. Blake and Sarah went to their tents with sleepy smiles on their faces and Mandy and I lounged by the fire.

There, in that moment, I'm pretty sure I was the happiest I had ever been in my entire life. That being said, I can't be certain that it doesn't just seem like that when juxtaposed by the events that came after.

I woke up in the dark. I looked over to where Mandy should have been, but she wasn't there. Feeling confused, I got up and walked to the open door flap of the tent. There was a stillness to the air that felt... wrong. I looked around, but Mandy was nowhere to be seen. As my eyes scanned the dark around the camp for a human form, I noticed Blake's tent was open as well. When I looked into the opening, I could see that Blake was missing too.

I began to get a bad feeling, but pushed it down. I instead walked towards the Larson campsite to see if maybe Mandy and Blake were over there, but when I arrived, I found their tents all empty.

The foreboding sensation boiling in my stomach began to evolve into a blooming sense of dread in my chest. I spent the next few minutes jogging to where I parked the car only to find it gone when I arrived. I tried to ignore what my mind was beginning to put together and began walking.

It was a few miles back to the farm by road, but with cutting through fields and hopping a few fences, I could make it back there in about an hour and a half. Every step I took, my mind began to race faster and faster.

‚ÄúSo, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help,‚Äù I could hear Cal saying.

I walked a bit longer.

‚ÄúThe well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better,‚Äù I could hear Mandy saying in my mind.

I walked faster now, my heart thundering in my chest.

‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle,‚Äù I could hear her saying to Blake now.

I ran the last bit of the way from there. I jumped the fence and entered into the massive cornfield that led up to the farmhouse. The corn pressed in from all sides, but I knew to keep the fence to my left as I followed it up to where I could see firelight dancing in the distance.

The first thing I arrived at was the barn. I crept up to the doors, trying to open them as silently as possible. I could hear voices in the distance, down by where the well sat silent and hungry. I went to pull the door open, but found it locked. It was at that moment that I realized I forgot to grab my keys from the camp.

I crept around the side of the barn until I could see the well and the crowd that had gathered around it. At least three dozen people were holding torches and all facing the well, seemingly waiting for something.

‚ÄúChester...‚Äù I heard a rumbling voice speak from just behind me.

I turned and was relieved to see Otto standing there.

‚ÄúThank God, Otto, we need to do something. I think they're about to sacrifice Blake to the well.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry, Chester, they would never do that. Blake is the next caretaker.‚Äù

My blood froze in my veins and I took an involuntary step backwards.

‚ÄúWhat are you saying... Otto, that can't be what's happening.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe must feed the well, Chester.‚Äù

Otto began to change in front of me. His features became less defined. He still looked like an old man, but there was something else there now too. It was like looking at something with 3D glasses, but the second image was something grotesque. Too many eyes and a mouth that was more of a mandible than anything human.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I shouted and jumped back.

I wasn't fast enough and Otto grabbed both of my arms in his and held me in place. I struggled, but his iron grip held me there.

‚ÄúCome, Chester. Come witness a miracle.‚Äù

He began marching me towards the well, hauling me as I kicked and scrambled uselessly the whole way.

I recognized some of the people gathered there. There was Henry, a regular at the bar. Jordan, the girl who ran the sewing shop in town. Jennifer Larson, who's husband and daughter were noticeably absent.

Oh no.

I realized what was happening them. I looked over to the farmhouse to see Mandy leading Blake towards the well with a hand on either shoulder, the boy beaming with a toothy smile. Behind her was Calvin similarly leading Cary. I twisted hard in Otto's grasp to no avail.

‚ÄúDo you know how long I had endured you grandfather's meager rations? How long the most I could look forward to was a desiccated corpse to be thrown down my gullet?‚Äù He leaned in near me, his voice a low snarl. ‚ÄúDo you know how much I've hungered in the dark?‚Äù

I was crying now, tears streaming down my face.

‚ÄúPlease... please, let me go...‚Äù

Otto responded with stony silence as he turned me towards the well and held me in place by my shoulders. I watched as Mandy led Blake to where he could watch. I could hear her as she looked down and spoke to him.

‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.‚Äù

Calvin lifted Cary up and sat her on the edge of the well, giving her a kiss on her forehead. She looked up at him serenely, not a hint of terror on her face. That's when he turned and looked at me expectantly.

‚ÄúYou have to choose, Chester.‚Äù Otto whispered behind me. ‚ÄúYou have to choose to make this trade. Ask for your brother to be returned to you and he shall be.‚Äù

I closed my eyes hard, then opened them and looked into Mandy's green orbs that looked back at me with a smile. I looked back over to Calvin with his face of grim expectation. Finally, I opened my mouth and I spoke.

It's been a while since all that happened. I'm sitting in the airport now, waiting to board my flight, writing this on my laptop. I'm flying back home to the farm after picking up Susan.

I met Susan on a message board about the paranormal. She's only seventeen, but she wants to start her own paranormal YouTube channel. I went out to meet her and we're flying back to the farm so she can research the well.

I told her there's some kind of weird artifact at the bottom of it.

It's wrong, sure, but I'm going to have my brother over soon. He was found a couple weeks ago with amnesia a few towns away. No idea how he got there, and with him having no memory of how it happened, it looked like a mystery that would never be solved. I wasn't able to see the tearful reunion between him and Sarah, but I was definitely happy to hear about it.

It was definitely something Blake needed. After he got back from the camping trip, he had been really quiet and withdrawn, but his dad's reappearance seemed to have brought him out of it.

Sarah just seemed happy to have her family back.

I'm having all three of them as well as a bunch of other guests out over to the farm for the wedding. Mandy and I still haven't decided where we want to go to for our honeymoon, but at least we know the well will be okay in the meantime.

Well, Susan and I are boarding the plane now, so I have to go. She's so happy and bubbly that I almost feel some guilt for what I'm about to do. Almost.

At the end of the day, I have to do what I was always meant to do. I have to feed the well.

## Key Features Analysis

The following analysis highlights the significant features that provide superior performance and user-friendliness.

**Water Filtration System:**
A high-quality water filtration system is essential for any water dispenser. The best models utilize multi-stage filtration, including sediment, carbon, and potentially reverse osmosis filters, to remove impurities and improve the taste of the water.This ensures that both the dispensed water and the brewed coffee are free from chlorine, lead, and other contaminants. Some systems also include UV sterilization to kill bacteria and viruses.

**Coffee Brewing Capabilities:**
The coffee brewing component can range from a simple single-serve pod system to a more complex drip coffee maker with programmable features.Key considerations include the brewing capacity, the type of coffee accepted (ground coffee vs. pods),and the ability to adjust the brew strength.Look for features like a programmable timer, automatic shut-off, and a keep-warm function to maintain coffee freshness for an extended period.**Temperature Control:**
Precise temperature control is critical for both dispensing water and brewing coffee. The ideal water dispenser should offer multiple temperature settings, including cold, room temperature, and hot water, for different beverages and purposes. The coffee brewing component should reach and maintain the optimal temperature for extracting the full flavor from the coffee grounds or pods.Some advanced models allow users to customize the water temperature for brewing different types of coffee or tea.**Dispensing Mechanisms:**
The dispensing mechanism should be user-friendly and leak-proof. Options range from push-button controls to lever-operated faucets. Some models incorporate touchless dispensing technology for enhanced hygiene. The water dispenser should also have a sufficient water tank capacity to meet the needs of the household or office.Consider models with a removable drip tray for easy cleaning and maintenance.

**Water Tank Capacity:**
A larger tank capacity reduces the frequency of refills. A typical capacity for a combination water dispenser coffee machine is between 2-5 gallons. Larger households or office settings will need larger tanks than smaller ones. The material that the tank is made from is also import, such as BPA-Free plastics and stainless steel options.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:**
Ease of cleaning and maintenance is a critical factor for long-term usability. Look for models with removable components that can be easily washed in the dishwasher or by hand.Some dispensers also have self-cleaning functions that help prevent the buildup of mineral deposits and bacteria. Regular descaling is typically recommended to maintain optimal performance.

## Core Benefits

**Time savings:**
The combination of a water dispenser and coffee maker eliminates the need for separate appliances,saving time and effort. Users can quickly dispense fresh, filtered water for hydration or brew a cup of coffee without switching between multiple devices. This is particularly beneficial during busy mornings or when hosting guests.

**space Optimization:**
The consolidated design of this appliance saves valuable counter space, especially in smaller kitchens or office breakrooms.Instead of cluttering the countertop with a water dispenser and a coffee maker, you only need one device. This creates a cleaner, more organized environment and frees up space for food preparation or other tasks.

**Cost Efficiency:**
Although the initial investment may be higher than purchasing separate appliances, a water dispenser with a coffee maker can be more cost-effective in the long run. The filtered water eliminates the need for bottled water, reducing waste and saving money. Additionally, some models are designed to be energy-efficient, minimizing electricity consumption during operation.

**Enhanced Convenience:**
The convenience of having both water and coffee readily available in one appliance is unparalleled. Users can easily access hot or cold water for various beverages, such as tea, instant soups, or oatmeal. The coffee maker can be programmed to brew coffee at a specific time, ensuring a fresh pot is ready when you wake up or arrive at the office.

**Sustainability:**
By eliminating the need for single-use plastic bottles and coffee pods (depending on the model), a water dispenser with a coffee maker can contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle. Using reusable water bottles and ground coffee reduces waste and minimizes the environmental impact. Some manufacturers also prioritize using eco-friendly materials in the construction of their appliances.

From blurred work-life boundaries to isolation and distractions, remote workers need intentional steps to thrive. Here is a practical guide to the best solutions for common remote work challenges:



**1. Challenge: Time Blindness & Overworking**

**Solution: Scheduling + Time Awareness**

Without reminders in the office, work time can creep into personal time. Resist this by:

* Having Fixed Work Hours: Establish start/end times and make them known to your team.

* Time Tracking: Use something like a toggletimer to track where your time is going visually. This is not micromanagement‚Äîit's about intercepting inefficiencies (e.g., unconscious 3-hour email binges) and logging off.

* Calendar Blocking: Schedule deep work, meetings, breaks, and personal time. Make these blocks non-negotiable and schedule them first.



**2. Challenge: Home Distractions**

**Solution: Environment Design + Focus Techniques**

Home disorganization can disrupt concentration. Take back control by:

* Dedicated Workspace: Even a dedicated small space signals ""[work mode](https://www.toggletimer.com/).""

* Noise Management: Listen using noise-canceling headphones or ambient sound programs (e.g., rain noise).

* Pomodoro Technique: Alternate between 25-minute work sessions and 5-minute breaks. Apps such as Focus Keeper automate this for you.



**3. Challenge: Isolation & Burnout**

**Solution: Active Engagement + Boundaries**

Loneliness and constant work mode are bad for mental well-being. Counteract that with:

* Virtual Socializing: Enjoy regular virtual coffees or virtual work communities with coworkers.

* Ritualized Breaks: Take a walk, stretch, or meditate‚Äîoff screens.

* Offline Activities: Emphasize activities that don't involve a keyboard (e.g., gardening, cooking).



**4. Challenge: Communication Gaps**

**Solution: Clarity-First Practices**

Miscommunication escalates rapidly remotely. Avoid this by:

* Over-communicating: Check for understanding in communications (e.g., ""To summarize, next steps are X"").

* Async-First Culture: Record by default (Loom, Notion) rather than live calls when feasible.

* Weekly Syncs: Brief video check-ins for aligning priorities and resolving blockers.



**5. Challenge: Unpredictable Productivity**

**Solution: Task Batching + Energy Alignment**

Energy will fluctuate normally. Optimize output by:

* Batching Similar Tasks: Batch similar emails, calls, or creative work to minimize context-switching.

* Energy Mapping: Track your most focused times (e.g., using a toggletimer to indicate when you're at your most focused). Schedule complex tasks at peak energy times.

* The ""Two-Minute Rule"": If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately.



**6. Challenge: Tech Fatigue**¬†

**Solution: Digital Minimalism**

Endless notifications are stressful. Regain focus by:

* App Consolidation: Consolidate 5 apps into 1 single app (e.g., ClickUp for tasks/docs).

* Notification Culls: Mute non-essential notifications. Check Slack/email occasionally, not constantly.

* Analog Alternatives: Brainstorm with a notepad instead of a screen.¬†

**The Golden Rule: Try Everything There isn't a one-size-fits-all solution**

What suits one remote worker will not suit another. Experiment with tools (such as time auditors like a Toggletimer, habits, and environments. Monitor your mood and productivity for a week, and repeat. Remote work relies on self-awareness and flexible systems rather than strict rules.

Over the course of the next week, Mandy spent more and more time at the farmhouse. By the weekend, she had practically moved in. I felt like I was engaging in some shameful and depraved act of perversion, but like an addict, I continued to indulge. There was something about the way Mandy would look at me that made it impossible to even think of saying the word ‚Äúno.‚Äù

Each time I began to consider the horror of what she was putting into motion, I would picture my brother going over the edge of the well. That's how I ended up sitting at my kitchen table while Mandy talked with the sheriff over the phone. Apparently, he was a Wisher too.

I tried my best to ignore what was taking place with my consent. I failed miserably in that endeavor.

Mandy had arranged a prisoner to be brought up to the farm under the guise of a work-release program. I closed my eyes and forced myself to not think about what would happen this evening. I failed at that as well.

Mandy must have sensed this, because after she hung up the phone, she walked to where I was to lift my chin up with a gentle push of her index finger and kissed me deeply. It was almost supernatural how the words entered my mind as she pressed against me.

I suppose if it's just criminals...

I knew it was only the first of many rationalizations I would have to make. Still, I let myself be drawn into it. As she pulled away, I only barely registered that I was condemning a man to die.

Life with Mandy was dream-like. After the months of solitude, waking with her by my side didn't feel quite real. I'd reach out and brush my fingers along her black hair, pulling the strands from her ivory shoulders and watch as she'd smile in her sleep. If this was a dream, I never wanted to wake from it.

I'd wake up early and have coffee with her as she would get ready to leave for the bar. Not long after she left, Otto would appear and talk for a while. I didn't have the courage to tell him what Mandy was doing, but he also didn't ask. Instead, he'd tell me how much happier I looked and that he was looking forward to meeting Sarah and Blake when they came to visit.

I'm ashamed to admit it, but Otto was right. I was happier. Even talking with my mother had become easier. When she'd hold out hope that Danny might come back someday, I found myself smiling and thinking that he actually might. Mandy had told me that I could have anything I wanted so long as I was willing to provide the flesh the Well would desire as its price. More and more, that price didn't seem as steep as it had.

When the evening came that day, Mandy and I were waiting in the driveway as the sheriff pulled up in his SUV. He tipped his hat to Mandy and I, and even though he was wearing sunglasses, I was sure I saw a wink. He then went to the back of the vehicle and led out a man that couldn't have been older than twenty. The sheriff held the young man by his handcuffs as he walked him towards where Mandy and I were standing. We wordlessly turned and began leading the way to the Well.

‚ÄúI just want to say that I appreciate the opportunity to-‚Äù the young man began to say nervously, only to be cut off by the sheriff's sharp voice.

‚ÄúNo need to talk, son. They're about to go over orientation. Better listen up.‚Äù

I realized this was my cue and swallowed hard before speaking.

‚ÄúDon't worry, it's an easy job. We had some damage to the interior of this well and just needed someone to get lowered down to repair the masonry. It won't take long.‚Äù

We arrived at the well just as I finished speaking, a contraption of wood and cable suspended above it. It was a simple pulley system I had rigged up the night before. There was a hand crank at the base of the structure which would either draw a cable up or down depending on the way you moved it. At the end of the cable was a harness held in place by a metal spring-clip.

After he had his handcuffs removed, the young man nervously pulled it towards himself and put it on while the sheriff, Mandy and myself watched him wordlessly. After he had pulled the last strap tight around his thigh, he looked out at us expectantly.

‚ÄúOkay, go ahead and step into the well,‚Äù Mandy urged with a pleasant smile.

The young man suddenly looked confused.

‚ÄúWhere's the tools?‚Äù

Oh shit.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù asked Mandy, the pleasant smile suddenly replaced by irritated confusion.

‚ÄúYou want me to go down there and fix something, right? Where's the tools? I don't see any around here. It's just strange is all,‚Äù he he said slowly, eyes going from one person to the next and a look of trepidation darkening his features.

In response to this, the sheriff pulled his pistol from his holster with a slow and deliberate movement accompanied with an irritated sigh. He pulled back the slide chambering a round as the young man flinched backwards and began to take breaths in rapid secession.

‚ÄúCome on, don't do this! I just took some stuff! Pleas don't do this!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa, calm down! The tools are down there already, there's no need to freak out, okay?‚Äù I heard myself saying as I lifted my arms with my pams out in a disarming gesture.

The kid seemed to calm down a little, turning towards the well while the sheriff lowered his gun. The kid let go of the side of the well and was hanging over it, nervous sweat beading on his forehead.

‚ÄúOkay, so I just go down there and fix the well, right?‚Äù

I smiled at him, my hand reaching past the lever of the pulley system and instead grabbing the clip joining the harness to the cable.

‚ÄúThat's right kid. You're gonna fix the well.‚Äù I said reassuringly while my stomach churned.

I pressed down on the release and the clip came away with a loud snap. For just a moment, the kid's face contorted into a look of desperate terror as he sucked in air to prepare for a scream that never came. His gasp echoed up from the dark only to be followed by a meaty crunch. Then another. And another.

I stood there, bracing for the realization of what I had just done to settle over me with its totality, but the shock never came. Instead, I felt only relief mixed with cold acceptance.

When I finally did turn away, I saw Mandy and the sheriff both kneeling upon one knee with their heads down. Mandy was the first to lift her face up towards mine, her green eyes shining with renewed vigor. I had thought she was was in her forties, but the woman before me looked ten years younger than that. She stood to her feet and wrapped her arms around my waist with a coy smile.

‚ÄúHow many more,‚Äù I said, burying my face into her shoulder.

She laid a hand across the back of my head, her dark embrace a more complete oblivion than even the liquor could afford me. She pulled me in with those slow and deliberate movements, each smooth action reminiscent of a languid wave washing ashore... or a snake caressing its prey.

‚ÄúAs many as it takes, my love. As many as it takes for your dream to come true.‚Äù

I finally embraced her back, having made up my mind. After all, if it's just criminals that are being killed...

Sarah and Blake arrived a couple days after that. I picked them up from the airport with Mandy riding in the passenger seat. It was a three hour long drive back into the countryside, so we had plenty of time to get to know one another. I had been a little nervous that things might be awkward, but to my relief, it was the most normal moment I've had since I got the phone call about grandpa Silas's stroke all those months ago.

Sarah and Blake were standing next to the parking area as we pulled up. I got out and helped with their luggage, getting a good look at the two of them as I did so. Sarah had blonde hair that fell almost to her waist laced with a few streaks of premature gray. She bore the weight of the last few months admirably, but the wear of such exertion was clear upon her face in the dark rings beneath her eyes.

Blake stayed close to his mother, regarding me with a shy curiosity. When he met Mandy, that shy curiosity gave away to outright infatuation. He sat just behind her in the car, completely drawn in as Mandy described the veritable feast she would be preparing once we arrived home. She would look back at him and smile occasionally, those bright green eyes flaring with infectious excitement as she described the fun he'd have fishing and camping.

‚ÄúCamping sounds amazing, I haven't done that in years,‚Äù Sarah sighed from the backseat.

‚ÄúIt's going to be great, there's a really cool campsite the town uses,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere's lots of families up there this time of year, it's a lot of fun.‚Äù

I saw Blake grinning ear to ear through the rear view mirror and laid my hand on Mandy's knee. I felt her hand slide over the top of mine and give it a squeeze.

We pulled up to the farmhouse as the sun was beginning to set. I walked behind everyone else with the bags and glanced towards the silhouette of the well standing black against the waning light of the sun, the pulley system looking like gallows, and realized that this was the longest I'd gone without feeding it since I had come here. I smiled and followed the others inside.

Blake was falling asleep before we had even finished dinner and was already snoring upstairs as Mandy uncorked a bottle of red wine. She settled in at the table with the bottle and three glasses and began to pour.

‚ÄúSo how'd you two meet?‚Äù Sarah asked as the ruby liquid splashed from the bottle into a glass.

‚ÄúIt's actually really cute,‚Äù Mandy began. ‚ÄúDo you believe in fate?‚Äù

To her credit, Sarah didn't roll her eyes, though I wouldn't have blamed her if she had.

‚ÄúI'm not sure if I do or not, but I'm listening,‚Äù she said with an amused grin.

‚ÄúWell, Ches would come in every now and again when he was in town, but never really talked much. So, one day, I decide I'm going to flirt with him.‚Äù

Sarah snorted a little and Mandy gave me a wry smirk. I could tell she was enjoying telling this story she had invented.

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù Sarah prompted with another laugh.

‚ÄúI walk over to where he's sitting at the bar and tell him he looks like the first boy I ever kissed when I was eleven years old, and he looks at me like I'm crazy, but now I have his attention.‚Äù

She paused to take a sip of wine dramatically, masterfully building the tension. She finished and sat the glass down, turning to me to act out her next scene of the story.

‚ÄúYou know you never forget your first kiss, right? What was yours like?‚Äù She asked with exaggerated innocence and femininity, then dropped her voice into a mimic of my own. ‚ÄúMy first kiss happened not far from here at the lake where everyone goes camping. ‚ÄúI was visiting my grandpa and met a girl up there over the weekend. On the last day, I finally got up the courage to kiss her by the lake.‚Äù

She paused again, looking at me adoringly and slipping her hand into mine, all the teasing and mimicry melting from her voice as it filled with emotion.

‚ÄúI told him that's crazy, because that's exactly how I had my first kiss with old man Silas's grandson...‚Äù

I smiled at Mandy, staring deep into those implacable green eyes as she squeezed my hand. The story was a complete falsehood, pure fiction with no other purpose than to explain our meeting. Still, I lost myself in that fiction. I lost myself in Mandy's dream.

Sarah smiled at us fondly, then broke into crying with a sudden gasp.

‚ÄúI'm sorry, I don't mean to-‚Äù

Mandy was already on her feet, an arm around Sarah's shoulders as she told her not to worry.

‚ÄúIt's just the wine, honey, it's okay,‚Äù Mandy soothed.

‚ÄúI know, I just miss him...‚Äù Sarah whispered, turning to look into my eyes. ‚ÄúI know you miss him too, Ches.‚Äù

I nodded and laid my hand on her shoulder, unable to hold her gaze. I tried not to think of the fact that she was trying to comfort me, the man who had killed her husband. The only thing that allowed me to withstand that thought was the belief that I could also be the man who returned him to her.

The next day, we left for the campsite. I left the barn door open for Otto, in case he needed to borrow the tractor, and left to enjoy a week out at the lake. We had brought tents, fishing poles, food and about a dozen bottles of wine to enjoy over the next week. We all piled into the car and started on the short drive, no more than a few miles away.

We crested the final hill and could see Lake Meder in the distance, reflecting the brilliance of the sun upon its gentle waters. There was already a good number of tents around it and a few small boats on the water with fishing poles bristling over the sides.

We parked and retrieved all our gear to begin walking to our camping spot. On the way there, we passed families setting up their own tents, playing with frisbees or just sitting around their campsites. As we got closer to the water, we could see lots of kids Blake's age all playing on the beach or swimming.

‚ÄúCan I go swimming, mom?‚Äù Blake asked excitedly.

‚ÄúAfter you set up your tent. Where else are you gonna change into your bathing suit?‚Äù Sarah responded with a laugh.

We got to our spot and started setting up tents and unpacking gear. A short distance away was a family doing the same. There was a man and woman as well as a little girl about Blake's age. The man had a large build and dark brown hair. I recognized him from town as Calvin Larson, one of the managers of the feed store. I'd talked with him a few times and deduced that the woman must be his wife, Jennifer, and the little girl would be his daughter, Cary. I waved and smiled at them, prompting them to do the same.

For the first time since I had arrived in this place, I actually felt like I belonged in that moment.

We finished setting up the campsite and Blake wasted no time in changing into swimming trunks and running down to the lake. Sarah looked at Mandy and smiled.

‚ÄúThank you guys for this. It means a lot. It's the first time I've seen him this happy since his father disappeared.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thank you for being here,‚Äù Mandy said, giving Sarah a hug. ‚ÄúYou two don't even realize how much we wanted to have you here.‚Äù

I let Mandy and Sarah have their moment. I decided I would go down to the lake and fish off the dock. I had my rod and reel in one hand and my tackle box in the other as I followed the little trail that ran down from the hill we had camped on. I arrived at the dock and flicked my rod through the air, hearing the satisfying splash of my baited hook hit the water as I sat down.

I had been sitting out there for a few minutes when I heard foot steps echoing on the wooden planks of the dock. I looked up to see Calvin Larson walking towards me with his own rod and reel.

‚ÄúHi there, neighbor!‚Äù he exclaimed with a cheerful smile.

‚ÄúHey Cal, you're fishing too, huh?‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúWell, I hope to, but I'm gonna have to borrow some bait. I don't have any in my tackle box. I can trade for it though,‚Äù he said as he drew near, setting his tackle box on the dock and opening to reveal it had been filled with ice and beer.

‚ÄúI think we can make a deal,‚Äù I laughed, grinning at him.

We cracked a couple cans of beer and sat there on the dock, lines in the water and the sun shining overhead.

‚ÄúSo, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help.‚Äù

I looked at Calvin with a raised eyebrow. I had ceased to be shocked by locals knowing about the worst kept secret in town.

‚ÄúThat's good to know, Cal. Seriously, it's appreciated,‚Äù I answered him and took another sip of beer.

From where we sat, we could see Cary and Blake swimming in the lake. I smiled, remembering how Danny and I would play out here as kids.

‚ÄúI think it's going to be a fun week,‚Äù Calvin said next to me. ‚ÄúThe wife and I are going to grill tomorrow night. You'll have to bring everyone over.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds fun, we'll be there with a bottle of wine‚Äù I confirmed with a content sigh.

The stars that night were incredible, an explosion of light painted across the sky. Mandy and I watched them while laying next to each other in the grass. She was curled up against my side, head resting against my chest. I helped her to her feet and led her to our tent where she laid down and fell right to sleep. I stepped out to douse the fire and heard a voice coming from Blake's tent. I crept closer and peaked through the perforated material near the top to see Blake and Cary sitting next to each other.

‚ÄúI like you too...‚Äù I heard Cary whisper.

Blake leaned forward and kissed her awkwardly on the lips. They parted and grinned at each other.

‚ÄúI have to go back before they realize I'm gone,‚Äù she said after a moment.

‚ÄúOkay, but I'll see you tomorrow, right?‚Äù Blake whispered to her.

‚ÄúYou better,‚Äù Cary said with a grin as she stood up to sneak back out.

I hid behind the tent as she left, smiling at the innocence of it all.

Danny would have been proud of him.

No.

Danny will be proud of him.

I next morning, Mandy surprised us by make pancakes and coffee. She had brought a French Press, which was already full of rich, dark coffee wafting through the air as we awoke. She made me jump by appearing right in front of me as I unzipped the door of the tent. I laughed at my own fright as she handed me a coffee cup and kissed my cheek.

‚ÄúOh my God, is that coffee?‚Äù came Sarah from the doorway of her own tent.

‚ÄúIt is, honey, and there's pancakes too!‚Äù Mandy tittered as she poured another cup of coffee.

‚ÄúI like the way this day is starting,‚Äù I said wish a grin.

‚ÄúThen you'll love what we're doing later,‚Äù Mandy said with a sly wink.

‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe're having a picnic. I got a nice bottle of rose' and packed some bread and cheese for us.‚Äù

I took another sip of coffee, once again wondering if this could even be real. I decided I wouldn't question it too much, letting out an audible moan of approval at the quality of the coffee.

After we packed our provisions and hiked out to a little spot on a hill, Mandy and I sprawled on a blanket with a bottle of wine and a basket between us. We sipped and giggled as the light glittered off the tiny waves of the lake in the distance.

‚ÄúJust so you know, I'm really happy with you,‚Äù I suddenly told her.

She wordlessly reached out and held my hand, smiling at me with those perfect eyes.

We laid there watching as the clouds drifted lazily through the sky with our fingers intertwined. I thought back to the Harvest Moon and my sheer panic and horror as I fed a dead body into the well. Here I was after killing a living man and condemning him to the well, and I felt serene. I didn't feel an inkling of guilt. If there ever was any, it had been swallowed up the twin emeralds that shined out from Mandy's eyes.

By the time we got back to the camp, it was already sunset and we could smell the smoke of the Larsons beginning to grill. As promised, Sarah, Blake, Mandy and I arrived with a bottle of wine. Before long, we all sat around the fire, eating and talking.

‚ÄúSo, what do you think of our town so far, Sarah?‚Äù Calvin asked her courteously with a smile.

‚ÄúI like it a lot! I wish we would have come down earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kept you from visiting?‚Äù Jennifer, Calvin's wife, asked.

‚ÄúMostly my husband's job,‚Äù Sarah said, then stopped suddenly, clearly having tripped over small patch of pain she hadn't seen.

‚ÄúYea, Jenny and I heard about what had happened with your husband. We're real sorry to hear about it,‚Äù Calvin said in a sympathetic tone.

‚ÄúThank you. I pray to God everyday that he comes home,‚Äù Sarah added in a voice scarce above a whisper.

‚ÄúWe'll make sure to pray as well. God works miracles everyday,‚Äù came Jennifer's reassurance.

‚ÄúYes, he does,‚Äù Mandy said, looking at Blake with a smile as she did so. ‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.‚Äù

Looking back now, I shudder when I think of her saying that. However, at the time, I smiled at her and enjoyed my food and wine.

The night air was cool but not cold, and as the night wore on, we all entered a comfortable stupor of well fed euphoria and decided to call it a night. Blake and Sarah went to their tents with sleepy smiles on their faces and Mandy and I lounged by the fire.

There, in that moment, I'm pretty sure I was the happiest I had ever been in my entire life. That being said, I can't be certain that it doesn't just seem like that when juxtaposed by the events that came after.

I woke up in the dark. I looked over to where Mandy should have been, but she wasn't there. Feeling confused, I got up and walked to the open door flap of the tent. There was a stillness to the air that felt... wrong. I looked around, but Mandy was nowhere to be seen. As my eyes scanned the dark around the camp for a human form, I noticed Blake's tent was open as well. When I looked into the opening, I could see that Blake was missing too.

I began to get a bad feeling, but pushed it down. I instead walked towards the Larson campsite to see if maybe Mandy and Blake were over there, but when I arrived, I found their tents all empty.

The foreboding sensation boiling in my stomach began to evolve into a blooming sense of dread in my chest. I spent the next few minutes jogging to where I parked the car only to find it gone when I arrived. I tried to ignore what my mind was beginning to put together and began walking.

It was a few miles back to the farm by road, but with cutting through fields and hopping a few fences, I could make it back there in about an hour and a half. Every step I took, my mind began to race faster and faster.

‚ÄúSo, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help,‚Äù I could hear Cal saying.

I walked a bit longer.

‚ÄúThe well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better,‚Äù I could hear Mandy saying in my mind.

I walked faster now, my heart thundering in my chest.

‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle,‚Äù I could hear her saying to Blake now.

I ran the last bit of the way from there. I jumped the fence and entered into the massive cornfield that led up to the farmhouse. The corn pressed in from all sides, but I knew to keep the fence to my left as I followed it up to where I could see firelight dancing in the distance.

The first thing I arrived at was the barn. I crept up to the doors, trying to open them as silently as possible. I could hear voices in the distance, down by where the well sat silent and hungry. I went to pull the door open, but found it locked. It was at that moment that I realized I forgot to grab my keys from the camp.

I crept around the side of the barn until I could see the well and the crowd that had gathered around it. At least three dozen people were holding torches and all facing the well, seemingly waiting for something.

‚ÄúChester...‚Äù I heard a rumbling voice speak from just behind me.

I turned and was relieved to see Otto standing there.

‚ÄúThank God, Otto, we need to do something. I think they're about to sacrifice Blake to the well.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry, Chester, they would never do that. Blake is the next caretaker.‚Äù

My blood froze in my veins and I took an involuntary step backwards.

‚ÄúWhat are you saying... Otto, that can't be what's happening.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe must feed the well, Chester.‚Äù

Otto began to change in front of me. His features became less defined. He still looked like an old man, but there was something else there now too. It was like looking at something with 3D glasses, but the second image was something grotesque. Too many eyes and a mouth that was more of a mandible than anything human.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I shouted and jumped back.

I wasn't fast enough and Otto grabbed both of my arms in his and held me in place. I struggled, but his iron grip held me there.

‚ÄúCome, Chester. Come witness a miracle.‚Äù

He began marching me towards the well, hauling me as I kicked and scrambled uselessly the whole way.

I recognized some of the people gathered there. There was Henry, a regular at the bar. Jordan, the girl who ran the sewing shop in town. Jennifer Larson, who's husband and daughter were noticeably absent.

Oh no.

I realized what was happening them. I looked over to the farmhouse to see Mandy leading Blake towards the well with a hand on either shoulder, the boy beaming with a toothy smile. Behind her was Calvin similarly leading Cary. I twisted hard in Otto's grasp to no avail.

‚ÄúDo you know how long I had endured you grandfather's meager rations? How long the most I could look forward to was a desiccated corpse to be thrown down my gullet?‚Äù He leaned in near me, his voice a low snarl. ‚ÄúDo you know much I've hungered in the dark?‚Äù

I was crying now, tears streaming down my face.

‚ÄúPlease... please, let me go...‚Äù

Otto responded with stony silence as he turned me towards the well and held me in place by my shoulders. I watched as Mandy led Blake to where he could watch. I could hear her as she looked down and spoke to him.

‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.‚Äù

Calvin lifted Cary up and sat her on the edge of the well, giving her a kiss on her forehead. She looked up at him serenely, not a hint of terror on her face. That's when he turned and looked at me expectantly.

‚ÄúYou have to choose, Chester.‚Äù Otto whispered behind me. ‚ÄúYou have to choose to make this trade. Ask for your brother to be returned to you and he shall be.‚Äù

I closed my eyes hard, then opened them and looked into Mandy's green orbs that looked back at me with a smile. I looked back over to Calvin with his face of grim expectation. Finally, I opened my mouth and I spoke.

It's been a while since all that happened. I'm sitting in the airport now, waiting to board my flight, writing this on my laptop. I'm flying back home to the farm after picking up Susan.

I met Susan on a message board about the paranormal. She's only seventeen, but she wants to start her own paranormal YouTube channel. I went out to meet her and we're flying back to the farm so she can research the well.

I told her there's some kind of weird artifact at the bottom of it.

It's wrong, sure, but I'm going to have my brother over soon. He was found a couple weeks ago with amnesia a few towns away. No idea how he got there, and with him having no memory of how it happened, it looked like a mystery that would never be solved. I wasn't able to see the tearful reunion between him and Sarah, but I was definitely happy to hear about it.

It was definitely something Blake needed. After he got back from the camping trip, he had been really quiet and withdrawn, but his dad's reappearance seemed to have brought him out of it.

Sarah just seemed happy to have her family back.

I'm having all three of them as well as a bunch of other guests out over to the farm for the wedding. Mandy and I still haven't decided where we want to go to for our honeymoon, but at least we know the well will be okay in the meantime.

Well, Susan and I are boarding the plane now, so I have to go. She's so happy and bubbly that I almost feel some guilt for what I'm about to do. Almost.

At the end of the day, I have to do what I was always meant to do. I have to feed the well.

It helped to keep me sane. If you're not aware, this is a continuation of a previous post, which you can find [here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mother-Effective-797/comments/1ku31bp/hunger_of_the_well_part_3/)

Over the course of the next week, Mandy spent more and more time at the farmhouse. By the weekend, she had practically moved in. I felt like I was engaging in some shameful and depraved act of perversion, but like an addict, I continued to indulge. There was something about the way Mandy would look at me that made it impossible to even think of saying the word ‚Äúno.‚Äù

Each time I began to consider the horror of what she was putting into motion, I would picture my brother going over the edge of the well. That's how I ended up sitting at my kitchen table while Mandy talked with the sheriff over the phone. Apparently, he was a Wisher too.

I tried my best to ignore what was taking place with my consent. I failed miserably in that endeavor.

Mandy had arranged a prisoner to be brought up to the farm under the guise of a work-release program. I closed my eyes and forced myself to not think about what would happen this evening. I failed at that as well.

Mandy must have sensed this, because after she hung up the phone, she walked to where I was to lift my chin up with a gentle push of her index finger and kissed me deeply. It was almost supernatural how the words entered my mind as she pressed against me.

I suppose if it's just criminals...

I knew it was only the first of many rationalizations I would have to make. Still, I let myself be drawn into it. As she pulled away, I only barely registered that I was condemning a man to die.

Life with Mandy was dream-like. After the months of solitude, waking with her by my side didn't feel quite real. I'd reach out and brush my fingers along her black hair, pulling the strands from her ivory shoulders and watch as she'd smile in her sleep. If this was a dream, I never wanted to wake from it.

I'd wake up early and have coffee with her as she would get ready to leave for the bar. Not long after she left, Otto would appear and talk for a while. I didn't have the courage to tell him what Mandy was doing, but he also didn't ask. Instead, he'd tell me how much happier I looked and that he was looking forward to meeting Sarah and Blake when they came to visit.

I'm ashamed to admit it, but Otto was right. I was happier. Even talking with my mother had become easier. When she'd hold out hope that Danny might come back someday, I found myself smiling and thinking that he actually might. Mandy had told me that I could have anything I wanted so long as I was willing to provide the flesh the Well would desire as its price. More and more, that price didn't seem as steep as it had.

When the evening came that day, Mandy and I were waiting in the driveway as the sheriff pulled up in his SUV. He tipped his hat to Mandy and I, and even though he was wearing sunglasses, I was sure I saw a wink. He then went to the back of the vehicle and led out a man that couldn't have been older than twenty. The sheriff held the young man by his handcuffs as he walked him towards where Mandy and I were standing. We wordlessly turned and began leading the way to the Well.

‚ÄúI just want to say that I appreciate the opportunity to-‚Äù the young man began to say nervously, only to be cut off by the sheriff's sharp voice.

‚ÄúNo need to talk, son. They're about to go over orientation. Better listen up.‚Äù

I realized this was my cue and swallowed hard before speaking.

‚ÄúDon't worry, it's an easy job. We had some damage to the interior of this well and just needed someone to get lowered down to repair the masonry. It won't take long.‚Äù

We arrived at the well just as I finished speaking, a contraption of wood and cable suspended above it. It was a simple pulley system I had rigged up the night before. There was a hand crank at the base of the structure which would either draw a cable up or down depending on the way you moved it. At the end of the cable was a harness held in place by a metal spring-clip.

After he had his handcuffs removed, the young man nervously pulled it towards himself and put it on while the sheriff, Mandy and myself watched him wordlessly. After he had pulled the last strap tight around his thigh, he looked out at us expectantly.

‚ÄúOkay, go ahead and step into the well,‚Äù Mandy urged with a pleasant smile.

The young man suddenly looked confused.

‚ÄúWhere's the tools?‚Äù

Oh shit.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù asked Mandy, the pleasant smile suddenly replaced by irritated confusion.

‚ÄúYou want me to go down there and fix something, right? Where's the tools? I don't see any around here. It's just strange is all,‚Äù he he said slowly, eyes going from one person to the next and a look of trepidation darkening his features.

In response to this, the sheriff pulled his pistol from his holster with a slow and deliberate movement accompanied with an irritated sigh. He pulled back the slide chambering a round as the young man flinched backwards and began to take breaths in rapid secession.

‚ÄúCome on, don't do this! I just took some stuff! Pleas don't do this!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa, calm down! The tools are down there already, there's no need to freak out, okay?‚Äù I heard myself saying as I lifted my arms with my pams out in a disarming gesture.

The kid seemed to calm down a little, turning towards the well while the sheriff lowered his gun. The kid let go of the side of the well and was hanging over it, nervous sweat beading on his forehead.

‚ÄúOkay, so I just go down there and fix the well, right?‚Äù

I smiled at him, my hand reaching past the lever of the pulley system and instead grabbing the clip joining the harness to the cable.

‚ÄúThat's right kid. You're gonna fix the well.‚Äù I said reassuringly while my stomach churned.

I pressed down on the release and the clip came away with a loud snap. For just a moment, the kid's face contorted into a look of desperate terror as he sucked in air to prepare for a scream that never came. His gasp echoed up from the dark only to be followed by a meaty crunch. Then another. And another.

I stood there, bracing for the realization of what I had just done to settle over me with its totality, but the shock never came. Instead, I felt only relief mixed with cold acceptance.

When I finally did turn away, I saw Mandy and the sheriff both kneeling upon one knee with their heads down. Mandy was the first to lift her face up towards mine, her green eyes shining with renewed vigor. I had thought she was was in her forties, but the woman before me looked ten years younger than that. She stood to her feet and wrapped her arms around my waist with a coy smile.

‚ÄúHow many more,‚Äù I said, burying my face into her shoulder.

She laid a hand across the back of my head, her dark embrace a more complete oblivion than even the liquor could afford me. She pulled me in with those slow and deliberate movements, each smooth action reminiscent of a languid wave washing ashore... or a snake caressing its prey.

‚ÄúAs many as it takes, my love. As many as it takes for your dream to come true.‚Äù

I finally embraced her back, having made up my mind. After all, if it's just criminals that are being killed...

Sarah and Blake arrived a couple days after that. I picked them up from the airport with Mandy riding in the passenger seat. It was a three hour long drive back into the countryside, so we had plenty of time to get to know one another. I had been a little nervous that things might be awkward, but to my relief, it was the most normal moment I've had since I got the phone call about grandpa Silas's stroke all those months ago.

Sarah and Blake were standing next to the parking area as we pulled up. I got out and helped with their luggage, getting a good look at the two of them as I did so. Sarah had blonde hair that fell almost to her waist laced with a few streaks of premature gray. She bore the weight of the last few months admirably, but the wear of such exertion was clear upon her face in the dark rings beneath her eyes.

Blake stayed close to his mother, regarding me with a shy curiosity. When he met Mandy, that shy curiosity gave away to outright infatuation. He sat just behind her in the car, completely drawn in as Mandy described the veritable feast she would be preparing once we arrived home. She would look back at him and smile occasionally, those bright green eyes flaring with infectious excitement as she described the fun he'd have fishing and camping.

‚ÄúCamping sounds amazing, I haven't done that in years,‚Äù Sarah sighed from the backseat.

‚ÄúIt's going to be great, there's a really cool campsite the town uses,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere's lots of families up there this time of year, it's a lot of fun.‚Äù

I saw Blake grinning ear to ear through the rear view mirror and laid my hand on Mandy's knee. I felt her hand slide over the top of mine and give it a squeeze.

We pulled up to the farmhouse as the sun was beginning to set. I walked behind everyone else with the bags and glanced towards the silhouette of the well standing black against the waning light of the sun, the pulley system looking like gallows, and realized that this was the longest I'd gone without feeding it since I had come here. I smiled and followed the others inside.

Blake was falling asleep before we had even finished dinner and was already snoring upstairs as Mandy uncorked a bottle of red wine. She settled in at the table with the bottle and three glasses and began to pour.

‚ÄúSo how'd you two meet?‚Äù Sarah asked as the ruby liquid splashed from the bottle into a glass.

‚ÄúIt's actually really cute,‚Äù Mandy began. ‚ÄúDo you believe in fate?‚Äù

To her credit, Sarah didn't roll her eyes, though I wouldn't have blamed her if she had.

‚ÄúI'm not sure if I do or not, but I'm listening,‚Äù she said with an amused grin.

‚ÄúWell, Ches would come in every now and again when he was in town, but never really talked much. So, one day, I decide I'm going to flirt with him.‚Äù

Sarah snorted a little and Mandy gave me a wry smirk. I could tell she was enjoying telling this story she had invented.

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù Sarah prompted with another laugh.

‚ÄúI walk over to where he's sitting at the bar and tell him he looks like the first boy I ever kissed when I was eleven years old, and he looks at me like I'm crazy, but now I have his attention.‚Äù

She paused to take a sip of wine dramatically, masterfully building the tension. She finished and sat the glass down, turning to me to act out her next scene of the story.

‚ÄúYou know you never forget your first kiss, right? What was yours like?‚Äù She asked with exaggerated innocence and femininity, then dropped her voice into a mimic of my own. ‚ÄúMy first kiss happened not far from here at the lake where everyone goes camping. ‚ÄúI was visiting my grandpa and met a girl up there over the weekend. On the last day, I finally got up the courage to kiss her by the lake.‚Äù

She paused again, looking at me adoringly and slipping her hand into mine, all the teasing and mimicry melting from her voice as it filled with emotion.

‚ÄúI told him that's crazy, because that's exactly how I had my first kiss with old man Silas's grandson...‚Äù

I smiled at Mandy, staring deep into those implacable green eyes as she squeezed my hand. The story was a complete falsehood, pure fiction with no other purpose than to explain our meeting. Still, I lost myself in that fiction. I lost myself in Mandy's dream.

Sarah smiled at us fondly, then broke into crying with a sudden gasp.

‚ÄúI'm sorry, I don't mean to-‚Äù

Mandy was already on her feet, an arm around Sarah's shoulders as she told her not to worry.

‚ÄúIt's just the wine, honey, it's okay,‚Äù Mandy soothed.

‚ÄúI know, I just miss him...‚Äù Sarah whispered, turning to look into my eyes. ‚ÄúI know you miss him too, Ches.‚Äù

I nodded and laid my hand on her shoulder, unable to hold her gaze. I tried not to think of the fact that she was trying to comfort me, the man who had killed her husband. The only thing that allowed me to withstand that thought was the belief that I could also be the man who returned him to her.

The next day, we left for the campsite. I left the barn door open for Otto, in case he needed to borrow the tractor, and left to enjoy a week out at the lake. We had brought tents, fishing poles, food and about a dozen bottles of wine to enjoy over the next week. We all piled into the car and started on the short drive, no more than a few miles away.

We crested the final hill and could see Lake Meder in the distance, reflecting the brilliance of the sun upon its gentle waters. There was already a good number of tents around it and a few small boats on the water with fishing poles bristling over the sides.

We parked and retrieved all our gear to begin walking to our camping spot. On the way there, we passed families setting up their own tents, playing with frisbees or just sitting around their campsites. As we got closer to the water, we could see lots of kids Blake's age all playing on the beach or swimming.

‚ÄúCan I go swimming, mom?‚Äù Blake asked excitedly.

‚ÄúAfter you set up your tent. Where else are you gonna change into your bathing suit?‚Äù Sarah responded with a laugh.

We got to our spot and started setting up tents and unpacking gear. A short distance away was a family doing the same. There was a man and woman as well as a little girl about Blake's age. The man had a large build and dark brown hair. I recognized him from town as Calvin Larson, one of the managers of the feed store. I'd talked with him a few times and deduced that the woman must be his wife, Jennifer, and the little girl would be his daughter, Cary. I waved and smiled at them, prompting them to do the same.

For the first time since I had arrived in this place, I actually felt like I belonged in that moment.

We finished setting up the campsite and Blake wasted no time in changing into swimming trunks and running down to the lake. Sarah looked at Mandy and smiled.

‚ÄúThank you guys for this. It means a lot. It's the first time I've seen him this happy since his father disappeared.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thank you for being here,‚Äù Mandy said, giving Sarah a hug. ‚ÄúYou two don't even realize how much we wanted to have you here.‚Äù

I let Mandy and Sarah have their moment. I decided I would go down to the lake and fish off the dock. I had my rod and reel in one hand and my tackle box in the other as I followed the little trail that ran down from the hill we had camped on. I arrived at the dock and flicked my rod through the air, hearing the satisfying splash of my baited hook hit the water as I sat down.

I had been sitting out there for a few minutes when I heard foot steps echoing on the wooden planks of the dock. I looked up to see Calvin Larson walking towards me with his own rod and reel.

‚ÄúHi there, neighbor!‚Äù he exclaimed with a cheerful smile.

‚ÄúHey Cal, you're fishing too, huh?‚Äù I responded.

‚ÄúWell, I hope to, but I'm gonna have to borrow some bait. I don't have any in my tackle box. I can trade for it though,‚Äù he said as he drew near, setting his tackle box on the dock and opening to reveal it had been filled with ice and beer.

‚ÄúI think we can make a deal,‚Äù I laughed, grinning at him.

We cracked a couple cans of beer and sat there on the dock, lines in the water and the sun shining overhead.

‚ÄúSo, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help.‚Äù

I looked at Calvin with a raised eyebrow. I had ceased to be shocked by locals knowing about the worst kept secret in town.

‚ÄúThat's good to know, Cal. Seriously, it's appreciated,‚Äù I answered him and took another sip of beer.

From where we sat, we could see Cary and Blake swimming in the lake. I smiled, remembering how Danny and I would play out here as kids.

‚ÄúI think it's going to be a fun week,‚Äù Calvin said next to me. ‚ÄúThe wife and I are going to grill tomorrow night. You'll have to bring everyone over.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds fun, we'll be there with a bottle of wine‚Äù I confirmed with a content sigh.

The stars that night were incredible, an explosion of light painted across the sky. Mandy and I watched them while laying next to each other in the grass. She was curled up against my side, head resting against my chest. I helped her to her feet and led her to our tent where she laid down and fell right to sleep. I stepped out to douse the fire and heard a voice coming from Blake's tent. I crept closer and peaked through the perforated material near the top to see Blake and Cary sitting next to each other.

‚ÄúI like you too...‚Äù I heard Cary whisper.

Blake leaned forward and kissed her awkwardly on the lips. They parted and grinned at each other.

‚ÄúI have to go back before they realize I'm gone,‚Äù she said after a moment.

‚ÄúOkay, but I'll see you tomorrow, right?‚Äù Blake whispered to her.

‚ÄúYou better,‚Äù Cary said with a grin as she stood up to sneak back out.

I hid behind the tent as she left, smiling at the innocence of it all.

Danny would have been proud of him.

No.

Danny will be proud of him.

I next morning, Mandy surprised us by make pancakes and coffee. She had brought a French Press, which was already full of rich, dark coffee wafting through the air as we awoke. She made me jump by appearing right in front of me as I unzipped the door of the tent. I laughed at my own fright as she handed me a coffee cup and kissed my cheek.

‚ÄúOh my God, is that coffee?‚Äù came Sarah from the doorway of her own tent.

‚ÄúIt is, honey, and there's pancakes too!‚Äù Mandy tittered as she poured another cup of coffee.

‚ÄúI like the way this day is starting,‚Äù I said wish a grin.

‚ÄúThen you'll love what we're doing later,‚Äù Mandy said with a sly wink.

‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe're having a picnic. I got a nice bottle of rose' and packed some bread and cheese for us.‚Äù

I took another sip of coffee, once again wondering if this could even be real. I decided I wouldn't question it too much, letting out an audible moan of approval at the quality of the coffee.

After we packed our provisions and hiked out to a little spot on a hill, Mandy and I sprawled on a blanket with a bottle of wine and a basket between us. We sipped and giggled as the light glittered off the tiny waves of the lake in the distance.

‚ÄúJust so you know, I'm really happy with you,‚Äù I suddenly told her.

She wordlessly reached out and held my hand, smiling at me with those perfect eyes.

We laid there watching as the clouds drifted lazily through the sky with our fingers intertwined. I thought back to the Harvest Moon and my sheer panic and horror as I fed a dead body into the well. Here I was after killing a living man and condemning him to the well, and I felt serene. I didn't feel an inkling of guilt. If there ever was any, it had been swallowed up the twin emeralds that shined out from Mandy's eyes.

By the time we got back to the camp, it was already sunset and we could smell the smoke of the Larsons beginning to grill. As promised, Sarah, Blake, Mandy and I arrived with a bottle of wine. Before long, we all sat around the fire, eating and talking.

‚ÄúSo, what do you think of our town so far, Sarah?‚Äù Calvin asked her courteously with a smile.

‚ÄúI like it a lot! I wish we would have come down earlier.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kept you from visiting?‚Äù Jennifer, Calvin's wife, asked.

‚ÄúMostly my husband's job,‚Äù Sarah said, then stopped suddenly, clearly having tripped over small patch of pain she hadn't seen.

‚ÄúYea, Jenny and I heard about what had happened with your husband. We're real sorry to hear about it,‚Äù Calvin said in a sympathetic tone.

‚ÄúThank you. I pray to God everyday that he comes home,‚Äù Sarah added in a voice scarce above a whisper.

‚ÄúWe'll make sure to pray as well. God works miracles everyday,‚Äù came Jennifer's reassurance.

‚ÄúYes, he does,‚Äù Mandy said, looking at Blake with a smile as she did so. ‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.‚Äù

Looking back now, I shudder when I think of her saying that. However, at the time, I smiled at her and enjoyed my food and wine.

The night air was cool but not cold, and as the night wore on, we all entered a comfortable stupor of well fed euphoria and decided to call it a night. Blake and Sarah went to their tents with sleepy smiles on their faces and Mandy and I lounged by the fire.

There, in that moment, I'm pretty sure I was the happiest I had ever been in my entire life. That being said, I can't be certain that it doesn't just seem like that when juxtaposed by the events that came after.

I woke up in the dark. I looked over to where Mandy should have been, but she wasn't there. Feeling confused, I got up and walked to the open door flap of the tent. There was a stillness to the air that felt... wrong. I looked around, but Mandy was nowhere to be seen. As my eyes scanned the dark around the camp for a human form, I noticed Blake's tent was open as well. When I looked into the opening, I could see that Blake was missing too.

I began to get a bad feeling, but pushed it down. I instead walked towards the Larson campsite to see if maybe Mandy and Blake were over there, but when I arrived, I found their tents all empty.

The foreboding sensation boiling in my stomach began to evolve into a blooming sense of dread in my chest. I spent the next few minutes jogging to where I parked the car only to find it gone when I arrived. I tried to ignore what my mind was beginning to put together and began walking.

It was a few miles back to the farm by road, but with cutting through fields and hopping a few fences, I could make it back there in about an hour and a half. Every step I took, my mind began to race faster and faster.

‚ÄúSo, Mandy told me about your whole well thing you're dealing with. She wanted me to come down here and let you know that you're not alone and that I'm willing to help,‚Äù I could hear Cal saying.

I walked a bit longer.

‚ÄúThe well doesn't accept dead flesh for this. It needs to be a live human, the younger, the better,‚Äù I could hear Mandy saying in my mind.

I walked faster now, my heart thundering in my chest.

‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle,‚Äù I could hear her saying to Blake now.

I ran the last bit of the way from there. I jumped the fence and entered into the massive cornfield that led up to the farmhouse. The corn pressed in from all sides, but I knew to keep the fence to my left as I followed it up to where I could see firelight dancing in the distance.

The first thing I arrived at was the barn. I crept up to the doors, trying to open them as silently as possible. I could hear voices in the distance, down by where the well sat silent and hungry. I went to pull the door open, but found it locked. It was at that moment that I realized I forgot to grab my keys from the camp.

I crept around the side of the barn until I could see the well and the crowd that had gathered around it. At least three dozen people were holding torches and all facing the well, seemingly waiting for something.

‚ÄúChester...‚Äù I heard a rumbling voice speak from just behind me.

I turned and was relieved to see Otto standing there.

‚ÄúThank God, Otto, we need to do something. I think they're about to sacrifice Blake to the well.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon't worry, Chester, they would never do that. Blake is the next caretaker.‚Äù

My blood froze in my veins and I took an involuntary step backwards.

‚ÄúWhat are you saying... Otto, that can't be what's happening.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe must feed the well, Chester.‚Äù

Otto began to change in front of me. His features became less defined. He still looked like an old man, but there was something else there now too. It was like looking at something with 3D glasses, but the second image was something grotesque. Too many eyes and a mouth that was more of a mandible than anything human.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck!‚Äù I shouted and jumped back.

I wasn't fast enough and Otto grabbed both of my arms in his and held me in place. I struggled, but his iron grip held me there.

‚ÄúCome, Chester. Come witness a miracle.‚Äù

He began marching me towards the well, hauling me as I kicked and scrambled uselessly the whole way.

I recognized some of the people gathered there. There was Henry, a regular at the bar. Jordan, the girl who ran the sewing shop in town. Jennifer Larson, who's husband and daughter were noticeably absent.

Oh no.

I realized what was happening them. I looked over to the farmhouse to see Mandy leading Blake towards the well with a hand on either shoulder, the boy beaming with a toothy smile. Behind her was Calvin similarly leading Cary. I twisted hard in Otto's grasp to no avail.

‚ÄúDo you know how long I had endured you grandfather's meager rations? How long the most I could look forward to was a desiccated corpse to be thrown down my gullet?‚Äù He leaned in near me, his voice a low snarl. ‚ÄúDo you know how much I've hungered in the dark?‚Äù

I was crying now, tears streaming down my face.

‚ÄúPlease... please, let me go...‚Äù

Otto responded with stony silence as he turned me towards the well and held me in place by my shoulders. I watched as Mandy led Blake to where he could watch. I could hear her as she looked down and spoke to him.

‚ÄúIf you keep your eyes open and look, you'll see a miracle.‚Äù

Calvin lifted Cary up and sat her on the edge of the well, giving her a kiss on her forehead. She looked up at him serenely, not a hint of terror on her face. That's when he turned and looked at me expectantly.

‚ÄúYou have to choose, Chester.‚Äù Otto whispered behind me. ‚ÄúYou have to choose to make this trade. Ask for your brother to be returned to you and he shall be.‚Äù

I closed my eyes hard, then opened them and looked into Mandy's green orbs that looked back at me with a smile. I looked back over to Calvin with his face of grim expectation. Finally, I opened my mouth and I spoke.

It's been a while since all that happened. I'm sitting in the airport now, waiting to board my flight, writing this on my laptop. I'm flying back home to the farm after picking up Susan.

I met Susan on a message board about the paranormal. She's only seventeen, but she wants to start her own paranormal YouTube channel. I went out to meet her and we're flying back to the farm so she can research the well.

I told her there's some kind of weird artifact at the bottom of it.

It's wrong, sure, but I'm going to have my brother over soon. He was found a couple weeks ago with amnesia a few towns away. No idea how he got there, and with him having no memory of how it happened, it looked like a mystery that would never be solved. I wasn't able to see the tearful reunion between him and Sarah, but I was definitely happy to hear about it.

It was definitely something Blake needed. After he got back from the camping trip, he had been really quiet and withdrawn, but his dad's reappearance seemed to have brought him out of it.

Sarah just seemed happy to have her family back.

I'm having all three of them as well as a bunch of other guests out over to the farm for the wedding. Mandy and I still haven't decided where we want to go to for our honeymoon, but at least we know the well will be okay in the meantime.

Well, Susan and I are boarding the plane now, so I have to go. She's so happy and bubbly that I almost feel some guilt for what I'm about to do. Almost.

At the end of the day, I have to do what I was always meant to do. I have to feed the well.

1l19jtq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1l19jtq/reflecting_on_my_2_years_in_the_netherlands/,Reflecting on my 2 years in the Netherlands,"I moved to the Netherlands in early 2023 with high hopes. I had a solid engineering background, a Thai partner I love, and a job lined up that helped with visa sponsorship, relocation costs, and even finding housing in Delft. For a while, it felt like everything was going to click.

Then the luck started running out.


---

What I Loved:

Delft is beautiful, and I genuinely loved living there. Quiet, charming, bike-friendly. Great for my lifestyle.

Cycling culture is incredible. I gave it a 10/10 even in the rain. I miss that freedom every day.

Work-life balance was unreal. I had 40 days off, and nearly everyone took long summer holidays. I used that time to travel‚Äîespecially in winter when the weather wore me down.

I made friends more easily than expected. Despite what I‚Äôd read, my workplace had lots of expats, coffee culture, and Dutch folks who were open and easy to connect with.



---

Where Luck Turned:

I got laid off unexpectedly just 6 months after my partner joined me. She had 7 years of experience and C1 English but couldn‚Äôt get any traction in the Dutch job market.

I landed a great offer at ABB‚Ä¶ and then they retracted it after a long, drawn-out process. That hit hard. And because of the timing, I also lost eligibility for the 30% ruling‚Äîa major financial blow.

I did find another job‚Äîbut it was in Almere, with a brutal commute from Delft. It paid the bills, but wasn‚Äôt a sustainable setup, especially while supporting my partner and trying to stay afloat.

Our apartment lease wasn‚Äôt renewed after two years. I‚Äôd been lucky to find it at all (my recruiter spoke Dutch to the landlord), but starting the housing search again‚Äîespecially in that market‚Äîfelt like a non-starter.

Learning Dutch felt like shouting into the wind. I took classes weekly, but English was everywhere, and the culture isn‚Äôt exactly supportive of learners. I stalled out around A2-B1.

Healthcare? I avoided it. Heard too many frustrating stories from friends. I had insurance (because you have to), but I just got my checkups when I visited Thailand.

Restaurants were overpriced and underwhelming. So I mostly cooked at home. Groceries were cheaper than the US, at least.



---

Why I Left:

Lease ended. Partner still jobless. My commute was draining. I had no savings left. So we made the call to leave and move to Thailand.


---

Final Thoughts:

There‚Äôs a lot I loved about life in the Netherlands. But if you hit a string of bad luck‚Äîjob instability, visa stress, housing turnover, loss of tax benefits‚Äîit can become unsustainable fast.

If you're thinking of moving there, I‚Äôm happy to answer questions or offer a reality check. I don‚Äôt regret going, but I sure learned a lot the hard way.

[Behold: Behemoth by Tate Brombal & Nick Robles](https://preview.redd.it/5qqj1kb30g4f1.jpg?width=974&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14af14a38b34eb90a9903a3cc9bba1a6dd95bf6c)

I picked this one up because of Brombal‚Äôs name, having enjoyed his work on House of Slaughter. Just like HoS, this book shows a lot of promise and marks him as a writer to look out for - and Robles as an artist to be paid attention to.

I don‚Äôt want to give away too much information, as it‚Äôs one of those books that throws you right into the thick of the action and slowly answers questions. However, I do want to discuss what I like about the book so I‚Äôm going to describe it in very broad strokes: It‚Äôs a tale of the apocalypse, and of a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù and significant child (a girl named Wren) under the protection of a grown man (Grayson).

This is a pretty standard story trope setup, but there are a couple of things that make it stand out. The first is that Brombal spends equal time giving us the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù of the apocalypse as he does the ‚Äúafter‚Äù, which makes it a little more interesting, especially as this isn‚Äôt your usual apocalypse (and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm going to tell you about this).

The second thing I like about it is the relationship between Wren and Grayson. Unlike many instances of this trope, Grayson¬† does not suddenly discover fatherly instincts that he wasn‚Äôt previously aware of - in fact, he is not a fan of the duty he‚Äôs had foisted upon him. He is a deeply flawed human being full of addictions, vices and insecurities, and a large part of his story arc involves growing into his role, and warming to his initially highly combative relationship with Wren.

The villainous characters are very complex as well, with two main antagonists - one who has a connection to Grayson‚Äôs past life, a fascinating reason for feeling resentment towards him and a very understandable one for wanting to take Wren for herself. The other is a military type who is strongly hinted to have lost a child in the apocalypse, and is wracked with complicated feelings over the fact that his duty requires the death of a girl as young as Wren.

Robles‚Äô artwork is glorious too, particularly shining in the big, monstrous action scenes.

Overall a very good book. My only real complaint is that Wren has an abusive foster father at the beginning of the story who has the same name as me, and by that so mean the exact bloody same, and that‚Äôs just rude.



[Berlin by Jason Lutes](https://preview.redd.it/ws68qng80g4f1.jpg?width=1172&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9698b2d6ac694cb7c98edc2502fec23f2c83f068)

The setting: Berlin, Germany (duh), from 1928 thru 1933, against a backdrop covering the decline of the Weimar Republic and the rise of National Socialism.

The characters: A young woman from a small town who moves to Berlin to become an art student, a middle aged, politically-inclined journalist growing increasingly disillusioned with the world around him, a working-class woman abandoned by her husband who becomes active in the burgeoning Communist party, a socialite, a bohemian tomboy lesbian, and various others.

The themes: An exploration of life during in the city during one of its more turbulent times - notably, the first volume culminates in the Blutmai / Bloody May police brutality incident, which completely upheaves the life of one character and ends that of another.

Other areas investigated by Lutes include changes in political attitudes of journalists as the papers attempt to survive the economic unrest, and the lifestyles of those who frequent the robust nightlife happening in the city‚Äôs hidden quarters during this time period. A particularly fascinating storyline follows the life of a troupe of African-American musicians who are brought in to introduce a new genre named ‚ÄúJazz‚Äù to Berliners, and the way society reacts to them.

This book took Lutes 20 years to produce and it is clearly a labor of love, with intricate storylines laced into real historical events, rendered in Lutes‚Äô expressive black and white artwork. One of the more satisfying coffee-table books I‚Äôve read recently.

[Blink by Christopher Sebela & Hayden Sherman](https://preview.redd.it/u954hm0e0g4f1.jpg?width=975&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e6a8d72d81ee8846a6b711286f6d8ce9dc34e80)

This book stars a young woman named Wren, who suffered horrifying trauma as a child that she cannot remember, but manifests as an adult in anxiety and night terrors. She has a sleep paralysis demon named Cy (short for ‚ÄúCyclops‚Äù, because he has one eye) that she has been experiencing her entire life and has almost grown attached to. She works as a journalist, and uses her work and her writing to help her cope with her traumas, pouring it into everything she does.

One day, someone provides her with the slightest of hints which can explain what happened to her when she was younger, and she drops everything - she abandons her husband, her work, and her home, hopping a flight from Arizona to New York so she can find the brownstone where she spent her early years and break into it.I won‚Äôt say much more about the plot besides these broad strokes: cults, brainwashing, obsessive compulsive behaviour, and a paranoid journey into the belly of the house, which turns out to be a mazelike labyrinth of dark corridors, rooms full of shrines made up of TV screens, and twisted visions out of a cyberpunk nightmare.

This is a very effective horror book, made all the more so by Hayden Sherman‚Äôs beautifully expressive artwork. Sherman (and colorist Nick Filardi) especially shines once Wren enters the brownstone, as there‚Äôs a pervasive feeling that this place isn‚Äôt quite ‚Äúreal‚Äù, or at least that it isn‚Äôt of the outside world, and their art reflects this. The panel work very suddenly goes unconventionally wonky and avant-garde, at times even twisting and contorting to give the impression that you as the reader are traversing your way through a maze just as Wren is.

However, it‚Äôs never difficult to read, even on occasions where we have to turn the page around as the text turns sideways - Sherman and/or letterer Frank Cvetkovic (whichever one was in charge of the word balloons and narration boxes) do a great job guiding you across the page through the dialogue.

Sherman is clearly a fan of Sienkiewicz and Templesmith, though their art has a distinct style of its own without simply aping those greats.



[Bolero by by Wyatt Kennedy & Luana Vecchio](https://preview.redd.it/6dpd4lph0g4f1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e18987d375776a4c3ed45a29042a091e20ab1f10)

Unapologetically queer romance between a bisexual woman and a transgender woman, with intense, just barely censored sex scenes.

I‚Äôm saying that right at the beginning because not everyone likes reading about some of the things in that paragraph. I thought I‚Äôd make the content of this comic clear from the off so as not to waste their time.

Devyn (the bisexual girl) has broken up with Natasha (the trans girl), after a twelve year relationship that began when they were in high school. On top of that, her best friend is getting married to a man that Devyn is convinced is the absolute worst person for her.

She‚Äôs miserable, living a listless and unsatisfied life, sorely tempted into relapsing into alcoholism (she‚Äôs been sober for a while).

Then along comes a stranger, on the run from his own miserable life, who lets Devyn in on a means of escape: what if you had the opportunity to travel to an alternative universe and start again afresh? You get 53 chances to jump into a version of your life that took a different path and find a chance at happiness.

I know multiverses and alternate dimensions are a bit played out at the moment. However, I found this take on it compelling in that, much like with Devyn‚Äôs alcoholism and other self-destructive behavior, the dimension-hopping is very clearly a band-aid solution to the characters‚Äô deeper problems. It‚Äôs literal escapism, jumping into parallel lives to avoid solving the problems in your own, and not realizing that you‚Äôve brought your own personal problems with you until they start ruining your new life just as they did your old one.

I won‚Äôt delve too much more into the plot or the mechanics of the dimension jumps as finding all that out is part of the fun.

Luana Vecchio‚Äôs artwork is a tour-de-force. Her character expressions are realistic and believable, and her use of color and her page composition are both mesmerizing. I especially love way she demonstrates the switches in dimension with slight variations in color schemes and designs, making the whole thing smooth and seamless.

Heavy though the subject matter is, this one‚Äôs well worth a look.



[The Con Artists by Luke Healy](https://preview.redd.it/ewayxjnk0g4f1.jpg?width=1018&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7b7f327320ccfddc48e3167c67458f6c3110b451)

Frank, a queer Irish comedian wracked with anxiety, has his life slowly but surely hijacked by a childhood friend named Giorgio.

One day, while planning world domination with his friend Ro (aka a shared gig at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival), Frank receives a call from Giorgio saying ‚ÄúFrank, I‚Äôm in the hospital. I got hit by a bus.‚Äù

And so, Frank meets Giorgio at the hospital, then takes him home and cares for him while he waits for surgery to repair his severely broken arm.

The narrative episodically goes into detail about Frank‚Äôs neuroses, his self-deceptions (he boasts at one point that he never lies in his stand-up sets, but later gets called out for ‚Äútwisting the truth‚Äù in them), and his sessions with a therapist over his anxiety. It jumps back and forth between this and Frank‚Äôs time with Giorgio, who it becomes increasingly clear is a troubled man with deeply manipulative tendencies.

The novel‚Äôs author, Luke Healy, appears at the beginning of the book to assure the reader that every character and event in this story is fictional. As he does this, he dons a fake mustache, puts on a pair of glasses, and changes into a new sweater - transforming himself into Frank, the protagonist. It‚Äôs clear what he‚Äôs trying to tell us: Just as Frank does repeatedly throughout the book, Luke is lying to himself and to the reader. He, Frank, and Giorgio are the titular con artists, and they are their own victims.

It‚Äôs a frequently hilarious, unashamedly self-deprecating, and often beautiful story about the importance of honesty and a long-standing friendship that is well past its sell-by date.



[It‚Äôs Lonely At The Center Of Earth by Zoe Thorogood](https://preview.redd.it/5pjnz8bo0g4f1.jpg?width=975&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93c652c4765794cb522cd03f8262fa1a39879206)

This book has gotten a lot of buzz lately and I feel like I might be cheating slightly by putting a review of it in this post, but honestly, it‚Äôs so damn good that I can‚Äôt help but add my voice to the many that have been shouting it from the rooftops.

Essentially, Thorogood charts six months of her life from a mental health perspective, exploring her struggle with depression and self-worth, and frequently referencing her past history of suicidal thoughts.

The period covered takes place in the 23rd year of her life, soon after the breakout success of her debut book The Impending Blindness of Billie Scott, and coinciding with her collaboration with David M. Booher on adapting Joe Hill‚Äôs novel Rain into a comic\*. Also during this time, Zoe reaches a peak in her long-distance relationship with a man whom Zoe insists time and again that she is not considering a serious, long-term commitment, but, possibly due to her mindset and need for validation, seems to want him to be nonetheless.

(\*curiously, neither Hill nor Booher makes an appearance in this book - it‚Äôs not made clear if she ever even spoke with them, or was just handed the assignment by her publisher. Given that Thorogood resides in the UK and the other two are from the States, it‚Äôs entirely possible that she never indeed met them. This book goes into detail re: Zoe‚Äôs isolation from the world around her, and this seems like yet another example of it.)

The people she interacts with throughout these six months are fully aware that she‚Äôs chronicling her life with them as it happens - at one point, Zoe‚Äôs best friend gets uncontrollably drunk and passes out in her bathroom. Afterward, said friend insists that Zoe depicts this episode in the most unflattering way she can to emphasize what a wreck she was. A powerful moment happens when another character asks ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be one of the bad guys in your book, aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù

Thorogood‚Äôs artwork is beautiful and chameleonic, jumping between grungy-looking scenes of realism and warped, experimental passages. Zoe‚Äôs inner monologue is punctuated at multiple points by other versions of herself, all drawn in totally different styles and each representing a different facet of her mental state - there‚Äôs a childlike, almost chibi-manga-esque version which possibly represents Zoe‚Äôs young and innocent past self, an exuberant personality constantly trying to bring the mood up and getting quashed by the other personalities. There‚Äôs one of the more prominent ones, one whose face is often superimposed over ‚Äúmain‚Äù Zoe‚Äôs in the real-life scenes and appears to represent the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù state of a depressed person feeling detached and unable to become unenthused by the life around them - this Zoe is drawn appropriately in low-effort, sketchy and minimalistic style with very few distinguishing features. And then there‚Äôs an imposing, demonic figure who probably represents her self-doubt and the depths of her depression.

If this all sounds unbearably self-loathing and self-obsessed, Zoe is aware of that,muses on it a few times and wonders who the hell this book is supposed to appeal to. She also gets told to shut up at one point by one of her stronger positive aspects, who yells ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sad and mildly insufferable. Do you have any idea how big of a base that covers?!‚Äù

And to be honest, it‚Äôs true: Thorogood is sad and mildly insufferable, but she also unflinchingly bares her entire soul in this book and I found it quite impossible to hate her for it. It‚Äôs an incredibly brave and honest book that would establish Thorogood as a generational talent if The Impending Blindness of Billie Scott already hadn‚Äôt.

Oh, and by the way, she‚Äôs a little insecure about that last part - people call her ‚Äúthe future of comics‚Äù at multiple points in the book and it only serves to pile on the pressure. Billie Scott actually turns up several times as Zoe grapples with the anxiety over having to follow-up on a book that received so much acclaim.

I‚Äôm just gushing at this point, so I‚Äôll end with this: If I‚Äôd read this back in 2022, it would have ended up at the very top of my end-of-year best-of lists. It‚Äôs that fucking good.



[The Magic Fish by Trung Le Nguyen](https://preview.redd.it/r0xim7vs0g4f1.jpg?width=1045&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=efa707bc0effae19f2de398fb8f599f1b74a3490)

A semi-autobiographical story about a young boy named Tien, the son of Vietnam war refugees who fled the country by boat, settling eventually in the USA.

The story of Tien‚Äôs parents‚Äô life in Vietnam during the war and their subsequent escape from it is touched upon and informs much of what happens in this book, but it is not the primary focus.

See, Ti·∫øn is gay, has known he is gay for a long time, has an unrequited crush on a classmate, and is deeply concerned that cultural boundaries will cause his mother, Helen, to struggle to accept him.

Helen, for her part, has her own struggles - she is incredibly family-focused and struggles with her distance from her family, with the ongoing culture-shock of trying to fit into her new home, and with what she sees as an increasing distance between her and her son. In her own words:

\> My past and present selves speak two different languages. It feels like I died on that boat. And I‚Äôm still stuck in the middle of the ocean. Far away from my mother‚Ä¶ and far away from my son. I‚Äôm afraid Ti·∫øn doesn‚Äôt think he can tell me things.

Ti·∫øn helps his mother learn English by reading her stories as she works (she is a tailor). These stories become a framing device, the narrative jumping between them and real-life scenes, and each story is deliberately chosen as a metaphor for the personal struggles the characters are going through - two are variants of Cinderella, and the third is a retelling of The Little Mermaid.

The shifts between settings and time periods are noted via Nguyen‚Äôs choice of color - he renders everything in black, white, and a single dominant color to demonstrate whether scenes are happening in the present (red), the past (yellow), and a fairytale (purple).

And it‚Äôs beautiful artwork too. Nguyen‚Äôs choice to make Helen a tailor is a very deliberate one, as he seems to have a lot of knowledge and possibly some background in clothing and tailoring (the end of the book has detailed notes on the inspirations behind various costume designs) and this knowledge makes for striking pages.

The three fairytales build off one another,¬† enforcing the idea that classic stories are never fixed narratives and constantly change. This is something that is emphasized by the contrasting Cinderella stories, one of which comes from a book Ti·∫øn is reading, and the other which is told to Helen by her aunt. The first is very Disney-esque and child-friendly, and the other one is, not to put it lightly, fucking dark. I‚Äôm talking so dark it would make the Brothers Grimm look at it sideways.

This idea of fluid narratives and the unpredictability of traditional storytelling is of course part of the book‚Äôs central theme, tying into Helen‚Äôs history and Tien‚Äôs personal struggles. It informs the narrative in some unexpected ways that I won‚Äôt spoil, but culminates in a climactic moment between Ti·∫øn and his mother that, no exaggeration, damn near made me cry.

A small village named Haresden has recently been overrun by strange magical mishaps: Plants growing in places they shouldn‚Äôt be, people slipping into comas and not awaking from them, things like that. Jo, a young village girl, knows something is wrong and seeks out the only person she can think of to help: Orla, the young, solitary witch who has been spotted in the nearby woods.

Together the two girls (plus Orla‚Äôs little black cat, Sith, because of course) adventure around the town fixing the various curses that have befallen them. There is, of course, something deeper happening and Orla is tied to it, but I‚Äôll leave that up for you to find out more about by yourself. Suffice to say that a theme of this book is family, both the one you‚Äôre born with and also the one that you acquire over the course of your life, how the latter relates to the former and how the former can sometimes be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. It‚Äôs also about having a place to whom you belong, and reconciling that with both the good and bad that comes with it.

Remember how I compared Skip to a Pixar movie? Well, this one‚Äôs more like Studio Ghibli, complete with the lush, brightly colored landscapes, precocious child characters and general folksy charm. This would be a lovely book to read by a warm log fire on a cold winter night, it just has that cozy feel to it, y‚Äôknow?



[Next Testament by Clive Barker, Mark Miller & Heami Jang](https://preview.redd.it/3oq3au1z0g4f1.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f232d017b9aa37b00a14e8f52e79f82f0362bcb9)

(Yes, that‚Äôs Mark MillEr, not Mark MillAr)

You know the whole ‚Äúfather, son, Holy Ghost‚Äù thing? And the oft-debated discrepancy between the vengeful bastard God from the Old Testament and the kinder, gentler one from the New Testament? Turns out they were different Gods. The father, son and Holy Ghost are distinct holy beings, and the son and HG sealed the father up in a cage for his mad shenanigans and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so much fucking nicer when the New Testament begins.

But now Old Testament God has been freed and he is gonna have himself a second coming at everyone else‚Äôs expense. This version of God is a kaleidoscopically rainbow-colored Loki-type who, upon reading the King James Bible, says he ‚Äúenjoyed it thoroughly, though really, it should have included a disclaimer - ‚ÄòLoosely based on true events‚Äô‚Äú

This guy didn‚Äôt cause Noah‚Äôs flood because of a need for biblical cleansing, he did it ‚Äúsimply to see what it would look like‚Äù. He also didn‚Äôt burn Sodom and Gomorrah, he was in Sodom ‚Äúenjoying the place for its very namesake‚Äù until his ‚Äòbrethren‚Äô turned up and spoiled everything. It‚Äôs a gloriously anarchic take on God, kind of in the vein of Garth Ennis‚Äô Preacher although not quite so juvenile. It is also a Clive Barker book so it very quickly gets violent and bloody. Good, blasphemous fun, with beautiful artwork from Jang.

Having really enjoyed his work on the first two years of Lumberjanes, plus her She-Ra reboot on Netflix, I thought I‚Äôd go back and take a look at the thing that first made the industry pay attention to Stevenson.

It‚Äôs a hoot. It‚Äôs set in a fantasy/sci-fi universe where a disgraced Knight-turned-mad-scientist supervillain is pursued by his nemesis, a Knight by the name of ‚ÄúGoldenloins‚Äù (literally ‚Äúgolden dick‚Äù).

In comes Nimona, a young girl with a prodigious talent for shapeshifting, who a) has ambitions of being a villain and b) doesn‚Äôt give a fig about established concepts like chivalry. She latches on to the villain, ostensibly as his sidekick. However, their relationship becomes much more a case of minder/charge than mentor/mentee once she joins him on a mission and goes absolutely berserk, killing enemies left, right and center and royally scaring the crap out of all and sundry.

There‚Äôs more to it, including tragic backstories and wonderful character development for Nimona (guess what her happy-go-lucky demeanor is hiding?), the so-called villain and Goldenloins, all rendered in playful, children‚Äôs book-style artwork. The way the artwork emulates children‚Äôs books does, of course, make it so much more shocking when Nimona goes berserk and slaughters people, and that makes it all the more perfect as a result.

It‚Äôs a gleeful sendup of classic children‚Äôs story clich√©s, wrapped up in Adventure Time-esque weirdness and Gravity Falls-esque humour, seasoned with a dash of gory hyper-violence, written with a whole lot of heart and kept from overflowing by Stevenson‚Äôs sharp instinct for when to dial down the chaos and go for the feels. Such fun.



[Skip by Molly Mendoza](https://preview.redd.it/jmrb3igh1g4f1.jpg?width=1109&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4f6f7300969289d60356a2b0e134ec4695b8a70)

Two young children, a human boy named Bloom, separated from his guardian, and Gloopy, a strange, furry being of indeterminate gender who is outcast from their clan for being an optimistic dreamer instead of a hard worker like the rest, get lost. They find each other, and try to help each other get home, skipping through trippy, polychromatic alternate dimensions (the mechanism for this is unexplained, but it might be caused by a black stone keepsake given to Bloom by his guardian).

They meet, among other things, a weeping giant, a paranoid raven, a huge crocodile who is literally a party animal and just wants to play board games with them, and an omniscient, sentient computer simulation with a wild imagination. Their toughest challenge, however, is facing their own fears: Bloom with his sense of abandonment and fear of the unknown, Gloopy with the realization that their family are not entirely right but also not entirely wrong to be mad at them.

This whole book unfolds like a Pixar movie in graphic novel form. Seriously, it‚Äôs got all the quirks: Weird, adorable characters, vibrant artwork, bizarre fantasy settings, all anchored by the very human and family-friendly drama at the center.

It‚Äôs visually absolutely draw-dropping, with Mendoza using the dimension-hopping motif to frequently switch art styles with often gorgeous results - just check out some of the pages in this link.

I loved this book. It‚Äôs heartwarming and delightful and I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough.



[Snapdragon by Kat Leyh](https://preview.redd.it/5ocmay5x1g4f1.jpg?width=1031&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fa53366fd9f8c0ebe9540e13c265bd5ebc3177e)

Snapdragon, known as ‚ÄúSnap‚Äù by friends and family, is a young girl living in a poor rural community, the location of which isn‚Äôt stated but it‚Äôs appears to be somewhere akin to the Ozarks.

Snap is named as such because it‚Äôs her mother‚Äôs favorite flower (it‚Äôs a family tradition). She‚Äôs something of a social outcast, with people in town regularly describing her in terms that make her seem almost feral - a teenage boy calls her a ‚Äúweirdo squirrel‚Äù at one point, and another child warns their friends not to go near her because she bites.

It‚Äôs only fitting, then, that Snap should end up befriending the town witch, who of course turns out not to be a witch but a strange old lady named Jacks with an affinity for wild animals.

This is a story about outcasts finding other outcasts and bonding with them, and also about things not being what they appear on the surface and not conforming to expectations. Snap also makes another friend named Louie, a young boy who thinks he might actually be a young girl and starts going by ‚ÄúLulu‚Äù halfway through the book. Snap‚Äôs family has a longrunning legend about a monster stalking them named ‚ÄúOne Eyed Tom‚Äù, which of course also turns out to be something unexpected.

Snap herself has a wonderful conversation with her mother, Violet, who asks Snap if she‚Äôs ever felt like she‚Äôs ‚ÄúA boy, you know, kinda like how Lulu is a girl?‚Äù

To this, Snap retorts that no, she definitely feels like a girl, she just doesn‚Äôt want to do girly things like paint her nails or play with dolls.

Fittingly, this book is also not quite what it seems at first - roughly halfway through the plot, we‚Äôre introduced to an element of Magical Realism which I will not spoil, but suffice to say that it plays a key role in the book‚Äôs themes of self acceptance, and how being different is not a bad thing.

People who‚Äôve read Lumberjanes may recognize Leyh‚Äôs name as she was a co-writer on that series, and also its cover artist. This book is very much in the same vein as that one - a light, YA-friendly adventure yarn with some charming characters and an emphasis on self-acceptance.



[Stuck Rubber Baby by Howard Cruse](https://preview.redd.it/u5c4bbfr1g4f1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be59f0a1b3d19112a6647a065b0209db7ae1f195)

The story of a gay man growing up in small-town America during the Jim Crow era.

Cheerful, uplifting stuff for a sunny afternoon's reading!

I kid, of course. It's a semi-autobiographical tale of a young man named Toland, as he grows up struggling with the self-hatred foisted upon him by a culture which abhors him for what he is. He spends roughly half the book deeply closeted, to the point that he actively gaslights himself into thinking he's genuinely romantically in love with his girlfriend Ginger.¬†

This is, of course, happening against the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement. Toland lives in a small town in the South, and his town is in the grip of protests and crackdowns against African Americans. Toland works as a gas station attendant, but Ginger is a college student and a civil rights activist, so Toland quickly finds himself dragged into her world of violent protests and late nights at black-run jazz bars. There he meets an assortment of different characters - fellow closeted gay men, black activists, a drag performer, the straight black woman who plays piano for the local gay bar and is considered an ""honorary lesbian"", etc. This exposure to different lifestyles quickly causes a change in Toland, as he begins to shed his political apathy and come to terms with his identity.

It's heavy, intense stuff told to the reader from the perspective of an older Toland, who is happily out of the closet and settled with a partner. This actually makes for quite a fun framing device, as it's clear Toland has told his stories to his partner a few times and we see the partner interjecting at multiple points (""Tell them about X, that part's hilarious!"" or ""Wait, are you sure that's how it happened? You told me that part differently...""), adding a playful meta angle to the whole thing.

Cruse has a solid handle on pacing and dialogue and the whole thing is portrayed in alt-comix-style black and white, text-heavy artwork - despite a comparably smaller 200 issue page count, there's a lot packed in here and it's well worth the read.

This book is a reissue of a book written in the late 90s/early 2000s. However, , with controversies over LGBTQ+ rights and racial issues being as prevalent as they have been lately, it feels as relevant as ever.



[Tunnels by Rutu Modan](https://preview.redd.it/9rb5jxul1g4f1.jpg?width=1090&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b60e3b29eb2be07671d88b078e34bf4bdbd96e8)

Nili is the daughter of a famed archeologist named Israel, and is also attempting to be his successor. At the beginning of the story, Nili happens upon an ancient tablet that has been hidden from researchers in the private hoard of a wealthy collector named Mr. Abuloff. Nili realizes this tablet possibly shows directions to the legendary Ark of the Covenant.

Nili scrambles to assemble a team to help her look for the Ark, not only because of the fame it will bring her but also to complete the work of her father, who has succumbed to dementia. Nili describes practically growing up in the tunnels dug by her Dad, who obsessively searched for the Ark until his health failed, and then had credit for his work stolen by his former partner, a academic named Rafi.

Speaking of Rafi, he gets wind of Nili‚Äôs new dig. Nili‚Äôs brother, Broshi, works for him and is eager to gain the man‚Äôs favor so that he can get tenure as a professor, so when Rafi asks Broshi to join his sister‚Äôs dig as a spy, he eagerly agrees.

And of course things are further complicated when it turns out the likely location of the Ark is on the other side of the West Bank Barrier wall, in Palestinian territory.

Thematically, things should be fairly clear from the above description - the story is very concerned with concepts such as family legacy, the desire to leave a mark on the world (pretty much every character wants the Ark for the glory involved, whether it be for them or for others), and of course with this being a story about Israelis entering Palestinian territory, there‚Äôs a lot of discussion regarding relations between the two nations-within-a-nation, particularly when two Palestinian workers enter the scene and join the dig (Nili convinces the rest of their team that it‚Äôs worth it because Palestinians can work on Shabbat, increasing their efficiency).

It‚Äôs also funny. Like, bloody hilarious at times. One member of Nili‚Äôs team is a religious zealot called Shmuel Gedanken, who is accompanied by a small peanut gallery of twenty-something zionists. These characters provide a wealth of physical comedy and broad jokes about religious doctrine. There‚Äôs also Nili‚Äôs young son, Doctor (that‚Äôs his real name, and we‚Äôre never given a reason why), who is obsessed with playing games on cellphones and won‚Äôt miss an opportunity to pester characters with cellphones in their hand, asking ‚ÄúWhat percentage are you at?‚Äù (as in battery life) and begging them to let him play on it while the dig is happening.

A lot of the characters are quite broad, but they are almost all given moments to show they are not simple caricatures. Just for example, the aforementioned Doctor and Gedanken both play a pivotal role in saving the day later in the story when their obsessions (games and doctrine, respectively) give each of them an opportunity to perform acts of extreme bravery in the aftermath of a tunnel collapse.

There‚Äôs a lot happening in this book, with a lot of layers to the storytelling and some quite masterful shifting between comedy, sentimentality and high-stakes drama.

[Behold: Behemoth by Tate Brombal & Nick Robles](https://preview.redd.it/6e9sdax53g4f1.jpg?width=974&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=007f6c2d0d91680188f2521da14a407b89e297d0)

I picked this one up because of Brombal‚Äôs name, having enjoyed his work on House of Slaughter. Just like HoS, this book shows a lot of promise and marks him as a writer to look out for - and Robles as an artist to be paid attention to.

I don‚Äôt want to give away too much information, as it‚Äôs one of those books that throws you right into the thick of the action and slowly answers questions. However, I do want to discuss what I like about the book so I‚Äôm going to describe it in very broad strokes: It‚Äôs a tale of the apocalypse, and of a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù and significant child (a girl named Wren) under the protection of a grown man (Grayson).

This is a pretty standard story trope setup, but there are a couple of things that make it stand out. The first is that Brombal spends equal time giving us the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù of the apocalypse as he does the ‚Äúafter‚Äù, which makes it a little more interesting, especially as this isn‚Äôt your usual apocalypse (and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm going to tell you about this).

The second thing I like about it is the relationship between Wren and Grayson. Unlike many instances of this trope, Grayson¬† does not suddenly discover fatherly instincts that he wasn‚Äôt previously aware of - in fact, he is not a fan of the duty he‚Äôs had foisted upon him. He is a deeply flawed human being full of addictions, vices and insecurities, and a large part of his story arc involves growing into his role, and warming to his initially highly combative relationship with Wren.

The villainous characters are very complex as well, with two main antagonists - one who has a connection to Grayson‚Äôs past life, a fascinating reason for feeling resentment towards him and a very understandable one for wanting to take Wren for herself. The other is a military type who is strongly hinted to have lost a child in the apocalypse, and is wracked with complicated feelings over the fact that his duty requires the death of a girl as young as Wren.

Robles‚Äô artwork is glorious too, particularly shining in the big, monstrous action scenes.

Overall a very good book. My only real complaint is that Wren has an abusive foster father at the beginning of the story who has the same name as me, and by that so mean the exact bloody same, and that‚Äôs just rude.



[Berlin by Jason Lutes](https://preview.redd.it/f0f6x8c83g4f1.jpg?width=1172&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=324dd3053233973b51d39f5bce1e3b3e84245a8a)

The setting: Berlin, Germany (duh), from 1928 thru 1933, against a backdrop covering the decline of the Weimar Republic and the rise of National Socialism.

The characters: A young woman from a small town who moves to Berlin to become an art student, a middle aged, politically-inclined journalist growing increasingly disillusioned with the world around him, a working-class woman abandoned by her husband who becomes active in the burgeoning Communist party, a socialite, a bohemian tomboy lesbian, and various others.

The themes: An exploration of life during in the city during one of its more turbulent times - notably, the first volume culminates in the Blutmai / Bloody May police brutality incident, which completely upheaves the life of one character and ends that of another.

Other areas investigated by Lutes include changes in political attitudes of journalists as the papers attempt to survive the economic unrest, and the lifestyles of those who frequent the robust nightlife happening in the city‚Äôs hidden quarters during this time period. A particularly fascinating storyline follows the life of a troupe of African-American musicians who are brought in to introduce a new genre named ‚ÄúJazz‚Äù to Berliners, and the way society reacts to them.

This book took Lutes 20 years to produce and it is clearly a labor of love, with intricate storylines laced into real historical events, rendered in Lutes‚Äô expressive black and white artwork. One of the more satisfying coffee-table books I‚Äôve read recently.



[Blink by Christopher Sebela & Hayden Sherman¬†](https://preview.redd.it/tgkeury93g4f1.jpg?width=975&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b0a4bcc9e69724fb278435cd722019e4a88ddfc)

This book stars a young woman named Wren, who suffered horrifying trauma as a child that she cannot remember, but manifests as an adult in anxiety and night terrors. She has a sleep paralysis demon named Cy (short for ‚ÄúCyclops‚Äù, because he has one eye) that she has been experiencing her entire life and has almost grown attached to. She works as a journalist, and uses her work and her writing to help her cope with her traumas, pouring it into everything she does.

One day, someone provides her with the slightest of hints which can explain what happened to her when she was younger, and she drops everything - she abandons her husband, her work, and her home, hopping a flight from Arizona to New York so she can find the brownstone where she spent her early years and break into it.I won‚Äôt say much more about the plot besides these broad strokes: cults, brainwashing, obsessive compulsive behaviour, and a paranoid journey into the belly of the house, which turns out to be a mazelike labyrinth of dark corridors, rooms full of shrines made up of TV screens, and twisted visions out of a cyberpunk nightmare.

This is a very effective horror book, made all the more so by Hayden Sherman‚Äôs beautifully expressive artwork. Sherman (and colorist Nick Filardi) especially shines once Wren enters the brownstone, as there‚Äôs a pervasive feeling that this place isn‚Äôt quite ‚Äúreal‚Äù, or at least that it isn‚Äôt of the outside world, and their art reflects this. The panel work very suddenly goes unconventionally wonky and avant-garde, at times even twisting and contorting to give the impression that you as the reader are traversing your way through a maze just as Wren is.

However, it‚Äôs never difficult to read, even on occasions where we have to turn the page around as the text turns sideways - Sherman and/or letterer Frank Cvetkovic (whichever one was in charge of the word balloons and narration boxes) do a great job guiding you across the page through the dialogue.

Sherman is clearly a fan of Sienkiewicz and Templesmith, though their art has a distinct style of its own without simply aping those greats.



[Bolero by by Wyatt Kennedy & Luana Vecchio](https://preview.redd.it/42w1fqrc3g4f1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b04dba02ad38d96a3d113cdb15eb317a6bc56744)

Unapologetically queer romance between a bisexual woman and a transgender woman, with intense, just barely censored sex scenes.

I‚Äôm saying that right at the beginning because not everyone likes reading about some of the things in that paragraph. I thought I‚Äôd make the content of this comic clear from the off so as not to waste their time.

Devyn (the bisexual girl) has broken up with Natasha (the trans girl), after a twelve year relationship that began when they were in high school. On top of that, her best friend is getting married to a man that Devyn is convinced is the absolute worst person for her.

She‚Äôs miserable, living a listless and unsatisfied life, sorely tempted into relapsing into alcoholism (she‚Äôs been sober for a while).

Then along comes a stranger, on the run from his own miserable life, who lets Devyn in on a means of escape: what if you had the opportunity to travel to an alternative universe and start again afresh? You get 53 chances to jump into a version of your life that took a different path and find a chance at happiness.

I know multiverses and alternate dimensions are a bit played out at the moment. However, I found this take on it compelling in that, much like with Devyn‚Äôs alcoholism and other self-destructive behavior, the dimension-hopping is very clearly a band-aid solution to the characters‚Äô deeper problems. It‚Äôs literal escapism, jumping into parallel lives to avoid solving the problems in your own, and not realizing that you‚Äôve brought your own personal problems with you until they start ruining your new life just as they did your old one.

I won‚Äôt delve too much more into the plot or the mechanics of the dimension jumps as finding all that out is part of the fun.

Luana Vecchio‚Äôs artwork is a tour-de-force. Her character expressions are realistic and believable, and her use of color and her page composition are both mesmerizing. I especially love way she demonstrates the switches in dimension with slight variations in color schemes and designs, making the whole thing smooth and seamless.

Heavy though the subject matter is, this one‚Äôs well worth a look.



[The Con Artists by Luke Healy](https://preview.redd.it/bj7itgue3g4f1.jpg?width=1018&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a6f048a94e097a94c08518803ef7d4a6913f7c5)

Frank, a queer Irish comedian wracked with anxiety, has his life slowly but surely hijacked by a childhood friend named Giorgio.

One day, while planning world domination with his friend Ro (aka a shared gig at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival), Frank receives a call from Giorgio saying ‚ÄúFrank, I‚Äôm in the hospital. I got hit by a bus.‚Äù

And so, Frank meets Giorgio at the hospital, then takes him home and cares for him while he waits for surgery to repair his severely broken arm.

The narrative episodically goes into detail about Frank‚Äôs neuroses, his self-deceptions (he boasts at one point that he never lies in his stand-up sets, but later gets called out for ‚Äútwisting the truth‚Äù in them), and his sessions with a therapist over his anxiety. It jumps back and forth between this and Frank‚Äôs time with Giorgio, who it becomes increasingly clear is a troubled man with deeply manipulative tendencies.

The novel‚Äôs author, Luke Healy, appears at the beginning of the book to assure the reader that every character and event in this story is fictional. As he does this, he dons a fake mustache, puts on a pair of glasses, and changes into a new sweater - transforming himself into Frank, the protagonist. It‚Äôs clear what he‚Äôs trying to tell us: Just as Frank does repeatedly throughout the book, Luke is lying to himself and to the reader. He, Frank, and Giorgio are the titular con artists, and they are their own victims.

It‚Äôs a frequently hilarious, unashamedly self-deprecating, and often beautiful story about the importance of honesty and a long-standing friendship that is well past its sell-by date.



[It‚Äôs Lonely At The Center Of Earth by Zoe Thorogood](https://preview.redd.it/bmsaxn6h3g4f1.jpg?width=975&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=beb1c90ad0fac6b17d95a7dfbc0661442aac1d60)

This book has gotten a lot of buzz lately and I feel like I might be cheating slightly by putting a review of it in this post, but honestly, it‚Äôs so damn good that I can‚Äôt help but add my voice to the many that have been shouting it from the rooftops.

Essentially, Thorogood charts six months of her life from a mental health perspective, exploring her struggle with depression and self-worth, and frequently referencing her past history of suicidal thoughts.

The period covered takes place in the 23rd year of her life, soon after the breakout success of her debut book The Impending Blindness of Billie Scott, and coinciding with her collaboration with David M. Booher on adapting Joe Hill‚Äôs novel Rain into a comic\*. Also during this time, Zoe reaches a peak in her long-distance relationship with a man whom Zoe insists time and again that she is not considering a serious, long-term commitment, but, possibly due to her mindset and need for validation, seems to want him to be nonetheless.

(\*curiously, neither Hill nor Booher makes an appearance in this book - it‚Äôs not made clear if she ever even spoke with them, or was just handed the assignment by her publisher. Given that Thorogood resides in the UK and the other two are from the States, it‚Äôs entirely possible that she never indeed met them. This book goes into detail re: Zoe‚Äôs isolation from the world around her, and this seems like yet another example of it.)

The people she interacts with throughout these six months are fully aware that she‚Äôs chronicling her life with them as it happens - at one point, Zoe‚Äôs best friend gets uncontrollably drunk and passes out in her bathroom. Afterward, said friend insists that Zoe depicts this episode in the most unflattering way she can to emphasize what a wreck she was. A powerful moment happens when another character asks ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be one of the bad guys in your book, aren‚Äôt I?‚Äù

Thorogood‚Äôs artwork is beautiful and chameleonic, jumping between grungy-looking scenes of realism and warped, experimental passages. Zoe‚Äôs inner monologue is punctuated at multiple points by other versions of herself, all drawn in totally different styles and each representing a different facet of her mental state - there‚Äôs a childlike, almost chibi-manga-esque version which possibly represents Zoe‚Äôs young and innocent past self, an exuberant personality constantly trying to bring the mood up and getting quashed by the other personalities. There‚Äôs one of the more prominent ones, one whose face is often superimposed over ‚Äúmain‚Äù Zoe‚Äôs in the real-life scenes and appears to represent the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù state of a depressed person feeling detached and unable to become unenthused by the life around them - this Zoe is drawn appropriately in low-effort, sketchy and minimalistic style with very few distinguishing features. And then there‚Äôs an imposing, demonic figure who probably represents her self-doubt and the depths of her depression.

If this all sounds unbearably self-loathing and self-obsessed, Zoe is aware of that,muses on it a few times and wonders who the hell this book is supposed to appeal to. She also gets told to shut up at one point by one of her stronger positive aspects, who yells ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sad and mildly insufferable. Do you have any idea how big of a base that covers?!‚Äù

And to be honest, it‚Äôs true: Thorogood is sad and mildly insufferable, but she also unflinchingly bares her entire soul in this book and I found it quite impossible to hate her for it. It‚Äôs an incredibly brave and honest book that would establish Thorogood as a generational talent if The Impending Blindness of Billie Scott already hadn‚Äôt.

Oh, and by the way, she‚Äôs a little insecure about that last part - people call her ‚Äúthe future of comics‚Äù at multiple points in the book and it only serves to pile on the pressure. Billie Scott actually turns up several times as Zoe grapples with the anxiety over having to follow-up on a book that received so much acclaim.

I‚Äôm just gushing at this point, so I‚Äôll end with this: If I‚Äôd read this back in 2022, it would have ended up at the very top of my end-of-year best-of lists. It‚Äôs that fucking good.



[The Magic Fish by Trung Le Nguyen](https://preview.redd.it/nydb9saj3g4f1.jpg?width=1045&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74499f602be917c7d52416c4322260dd57d0cefb)

A semi-autobiographical story about a young boy named Tien, the son of Vietnam war refugees who fled the country by boat, settling eventually in the USA.

The story of Tien‚Äôs parents‚Äô life in Vietnam during the war and their subsequent escape from it is touched upon and informs much of what happens in this book, but it is not the primary focus.

See, Ti·∫øn is gay, has known he is gay for a long time, has an unrequited crush on a classmate, and is deeply concerned that cultural boundaries will cause his mother, Helen, to struggle to accept him.

Helen, for her part, has her own struggles - she is incredibly family-focused and struggles with her distance from her family, with the ongoing culture-shock of trying to fit into her new home, and with what she sees as an increasing distance between her and her son. In her own words:

\> My past and present selves speak two different languages. It feels like I died on that boat. And I‚Äôm still stuck in the middle of the ocean. Far away from my mother‚Ä¶ and far away from my son. I‚Äôm afraid Ti·∫øn doesn‚Äôt think he can tell me things.

Ti·∫øn helps his mother learn English by reading her stories as she works (she is a tailor). These stories become a framing device, the narrative jumping between them and real-life scenes, and each story is deliberately chosen as a metaphor for the personal struggles the characters are going through - two are variants of Cinderella, and the third is a retelling of The Little Mermaid.

The shifts between settings and time periods are noted via Nguyen‚Äôs choice of color - he renders everything in black, white, and a single dominant color to demonstrate whether scenes are happening in the present (red), the past (yellow), and a fairytale (purple).

And it‚Äôs beautiful artwork too. Nguyen‚Äôs choice to make Helen a tailor is a very deliberate one, as he seems to have a lot of knowledge and possibly some background in clothing and tailoring (the end of the book has detailed notes on the inspirations behind various costume designs) and this knowledge makes for striking pages.

The three fairytales build off one another,¬† enforcing the idea that classic stories are never fixed narratives and constantly change. This is something that is emphasized by the contrasting Cinderella stories, one of which comes from a book Ti·∫øn is reading, and the other which is told to Helen by her aunt. The first is very Disney-esque and child-friendly, and the other one is, not to put it lightly, fucking dark. I‚Äôm talking so dark it would make the Brothers Grimm look at it sideways.

This idea of fluid narratives and the unpredictability of traditional storytelling is of course part of the book‚Äôs central theme, tying into Helen‚Äôs history and Tien‚Äôs personal struggles. It informs the narrative in some unexpected ways that I won‚Äôt spoil, but culminates in a climactic moment between Ti·∫øn and his mother that, no exaggeration, damn near made me cry.

A small village named Haresden has recently been overrun by strange magical mishaps: Plants growing in places they shouldn‚Äôt be, people slipping into comas and not awaking from them, things like that. Jo, a young village girl, knows something is wrong and seeks out the only person she can think of to help: Orla, the young, solitary witch who has been spotted in the nearby woods.

Together the two girls (plus Orla‚Äôs little black cat, Sith, because of course) adventure around the town fixing the various curses that have befallen them. There is, of course, something deeper happening and Orla is tied to it, but I‚Äôll leave that up for you to find out more about by yourself. Suffice to say that a theme of this book is family, both the one you‚Äôre born with and also the one that you acquire over the course of your life, how the latter relates to the former and how the former can sometimes be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth. It‚Äôs also about having a place to whom you belong, and reconciling that with both the good and bad that comes with it.

Remember how I compared Skip to a Pixar movie? Well, this one‚Äôs more like Studio Ghibli, complete with the lush, brightly colored landscapes, precocious child characters and general folksy charm. This would be a lovely book to read by a warm log fire on a cold winter night, it just has that cozy feel to it, y‚Äôknow?

(Yes, that‚Äôs Mark MillEr, not Mark MillAr)  
  
You know the whole ‚Äúfather, son, Holy Ghost‚Äù thing? And the oft-debated discrepancy between the vengeful bastard God from the Old Testament and the kinder, gentler one from the New Testament? Turns out they were different Gods. The father, son and Holy Ghost are distinct holy beings, and the son and HG sealed the father up in a cage for his mad shenanigans and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so much fucking nicer when the New Testament begins.

But now Old Testament God has been freed and he is gonna have himself a second coming at everyone else‚Äôs expense. This version of God is a kaleidoscopically rainbow-colored Loki-type who, upon reading the King James Bible, says he ‚Äúenjoyed it thoroughly, though really, it should have included a disclaimer - ‚ÄòLoosely based on true events‚Äô‚Äú

This guy didn‚Äôt cause Noah‚Äôs flood because of a need for biblical cleansing, he did it ‚Äúsimply to see what it would look like‚Äù. He also didn‚Äôt burn Sodom and Gomorrah, he was in Sodom ‚Äúenjoying the place for its very namesake‚Äù until his ‚Äòbrethren‚Äô turned up and spoiled everything. It‚Äôs a gloriously anarchic take on God, kind of in the vein of Garth Ennis‚Äô Preacher although not quite so juvenile. It is also a Clive Barker book so it very quickly gets violent and bloody. Good, blasphemous fun, with beautiful artwork from Jang.



[Nimona by ND Stevenson](https://preview.redd.it/jcrd8vsq3g4f1.jpg?width=1014&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=683cd63bd3a7b67ed735989e04fd94419c96252e)

Having really enjoyed his work on the first two years of Lumberjanes, plus her She-Ra reboot on Netflix, I thought I‚Äôd go back and take a look at the thing that first made the industry pay attention to Stevenson.

It‚Äôs a hoot. It‚Äôs set in a fantasy/sci-fi universe where a disgraced Knight-turned-mad-scientist supervillain is pursued by his nemesis, a Knight by the name of ‚ÄúGoldenloins‚Äù (literally ‚Äúgolden dick‚Äù).

In comes Nimona, a young girl with a prodigious talent for shapeshifting, who a) has ambitions of being a villain and b) doesn‚Äôt give a fig about established concepts like chivalry. She latches on to the villain, ostensibly as his sidekick. However, their relationship becomes much more a case of minder/charge than mentor/mentee once she joins him on a mission and goes absolutely berserk, killing enemies left, right and center and royally scaring the crap out of all and sundry.

There‚Äôs more to it, including tragic backstories and wonderful character development for Nimona (guess what her happy-go-lucky demeanor is hiding?), the so-called villain and Goldenloins, all rendered in playful, children‚Äôs book-style artwork. The way the artwork emulates children‚Äôs books does, of course, make it so much more shocking when Nimona goes berserk and slaughters people, and that makes it all the more perfect as a result.

It‚Äôs a gleeful sendup of classic children‚Äôs story clich√©s, wrapped up in Adventure Time-esque weirdness and Gravity Falls-esque humour, seasoned with a dash of gory hyper-violence, written with a whole lot of heart and kept from overflowing by Stevenson‚Äôs sharp instinct for when to dial down the chaos and go for the feels. Such fun.

[Skip by Molly Mendoza](https://preview.redd.it/y8shy8bs3g4f1.jpg?width=1109&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37752e2d83ed641d343bd9eb8380e8e0882f4220)

Two young children, a human boy named Bloom, separated from his guardian, and Gloopy, a strange, furry being of indeterminate gender who is outcast from their clan for being an optimistic dreamer instead of a hard worker like the rest, get lost. They find each other, and try to help each other get home, skipping through trippy, polychromatic alternate dimensions (the mechanism for this is unexplained, but it might be caused by a black stone keepsake given to Bloom by his guardian).

They meet, among other things, a weeping giant, a paranoid raven, a huge crocodile who is literally a party animal and just wants to play board games with them, and an omniscient, sentient computer simulation with a wild imagination. Their toughest challenge, however, is facing their own fears: Bloom with his sense of abandonment and fear of the unknown, Gloopy with the realization that their family are not entirely right but also not entirely wrong to be mad at them.

This whole book unfolds like a Pixar movie in graphic novel form. Seriously, it‚Äôs got all the quirks: Weird, adorable characters, vibrant artwork, bizarre fantasy settings, all anchored by the very human and family-friendly drama at the center.

It‚Äôs visually absolutely draw-dropping, with Mendoza using the dimension-hopping motif to frequently switch art styles with often gorgeous results - just check out some of the pages in this link.

I loved this book. It‚Äôs heartwarming and delightful and I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough.



[Snapdragon by Kat Leyh](https://preview.redd.it/v9cibg0u3g4f1.jpg?width=1031&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=70c67877937206c8743a26900e210d7c931cecda)

Snapdragon, known as ‚ÄúSnap‚Äù by friends and family, is a young girl living in a poor rural community, the location of which isn‚Äôt stated but it‚Äôs appears to be somewhere akin to the Ozarks.

Snap is named as such because it‚Äôs her mother‚Äôs favorite flower (it‚Äôs a family tradition). She‚Äôs something of a social outcast, with people in town regularly describing her in terms that make her seem almost feral - a teenage boy calls her a ‚Äúweirdo squirrel‚Äù at one point, and another child warns their friends not to go near her because she bites.

It‚Äôs only fitting, then, that Snap should end up befriending the town witch, who of course turns out not to be a witch but a strange old lady named Jacks with an affinity for wild animals.

This is a story about outcasts finding other outcasts and bonding with them, and also about things not being what they appear on the surface and not conforming to expectations. Snap also makes another friend named Louie, a young boy who thinks he might actually be a young girl and starts going by ‚ÄúLulu‚Äù halfway through the book. Snap‚Äôs family has a longrunning legend about a monster stalking them named ‚ÄúOne Eyed Tom‚Äù, which of course also turns out to be something unexpected.

Snap herself has a wonderful conversation with her mother, Violet, who asks Snap if she‚Äôs ever felt like she‚Äôs ‚ÄúA boy, you know, kinda like how Lulu is a girl?‚Äù

To this, Snap retorts that no, she definitely feels like a girl, she just doesn‚Äôt want to do girly things like paint her nails or play with dolls.

Fittingly, this book is also not quite what it seems at first - roughly halfway through the plot, we‚Äôre introduced to an element of Magical Realism which I will not spoil, but suffice to say that it plays a key role in the book‚Äôs themes of self acceptance, and how being different is not a bad thing.

People who‚Äôve read Lumberjanes may recognize Leyh‚Äôs name as she was a co-writer on that series, and also its cover artist. This book is very much in the same vein as that one - a light, YA-friendly adventure yarn with some charming characters and an emphasis on self-acceptance.



[Stuck Rubber Baby by Howard Cruse](https://preview.redd.it/h1v51wwv3g4f1.jpg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d0d1b91943b4e977c766df01c0a8f795a61b730)

The story of a gay man growing up in small-town America during the Jim Crow era.  
  
Cheerful, uplifting stuff for a sunny afternoon's reading!

I kid, of course. It's a semi-autobiographical tale of a young man named Toland, as he grows up struggling with the self-hatred foisted upon him by a culture which abhors him for what he is. He spends roughly half the book deeply closeted, to the point that he actively gaslights himself into thinking he's genuinely romantically in love with his girlfriend Ginger.¬†

This is, of course, happening against the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement. Toland lives in a small town in the South, and his town is in the grip of protests and crackdowns against African Americans. Toland works as a gas station attendant, but Ginger is a college student and a civil rights activist, so Toland quickly finds himself dragged into her world of violent protests and late nights at black-run jazz bars. There he meets an assortment of different characters - fellow closeted gay men, black activists, a drag performer, the straight black woman who plays piano for the local gay bar and is considered an ""honorary lesbian"", etc. This exposure to different lifestyles quickly causes a change in Toland, as he begins to shed his political apathy and come to terms with his identity.It's heavy, intense stuff told to the reader from the perspective of an older Toland, who is happily out of the closet and settled with a partner. This actually makes for quite a fun framing device, as it's clear Toland has told his stories to his partner a few times and we see the partner interjecting at multiple points (""Tell them about X, that part's hilarious!"" or ""Wait, are you sure that's how it happened? You told me that part differently...""), adding a playful meta angle to the whole thing.

Cruse has a solid handle on pacing and dialogue and the whole thing is portrayed in alt-comix-style black and white, text-heavy artwork - despite a comparably smaller 200 issue page count, there's a lot packed in here and it's well worth the read.

This book is a reissue of a book written in the late 90s/early 2000s. However, , with controversies over LGBTQ+ rights and racial issues being as prevalent as they have been lately, it feels as relevant as ever.



[Tunnels by Rutu Modan](https://preview.redd.it/70jaodc24g4f1.jpg?width=1090&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5d1b4871b26d3a2f5507aa59ada8dc0a60b3014)

Nili is the daughter of a famed archeologist named Israel, and is also attempting to be his successor. At the beginning of the story, Nili happens upon an ancient tablet that has been hidden from researchers in the private hoard of a wealthy collector named Mr. Abuloff. Nili realizes this tablet possibly shows directions to the legendary Ark of the Covenant.

Nili scrambles to assemble a team to help her look for the Ark, not only because of the fame it will bring her but also to complete the work of her father, who has succumbed to dementia. Nili describes practically growing up in the tunnels dug by her Dad, who obsessively searched for the Ark until his health failed, and then had credit for his work stolen by his former partner, a academic named Rafi.

Speaking of Rafi, he gets wind of Nili‚Äôs new dig. Nili‚Äôs brother, Broshi, works for him and is eager to gain the man‚Äôs favor so that he can get tenure as a professor, so when Rafi asks Broshi to join his sister‚Äôs dig as a spy, he eagerly agrees.And of course things are further complicated when it turns out the likely location of the Ark is on the other side of the West Bank Barrier wall, in Palestinian territory.

Thematically, things should be fairly clear from the above description - the story is very concerned with concepts such as family legacy, the desire to leave a mark on the world (pretty much every character wants the Ark for the glory involved, whether it be for them or for others), and of course with this being a story about Israelis entering Palestinian territory, there‚Äôs a lot of discussion regarding relations between the two nations-within-a-nation, particularly when two Palestinian workers enter the scene and join the dig (Nili convinces the rest of their team that it‚Äôs worth it because Palestinians can work on Shabbat, increasing their efficiency).

It‚Äôs also funny. Like, bloody hilarious at times. One member of Nili‚Äôs team is a religious zealot called Shmuel Gedanken, who is accompanied by a small peanut gallery of twenty-something zionists. These characters provide a wealth of physical comedy and broad jokes about religious doctrine. There‚Äôs also Nili‚Äôs young son, Doctor (that‚Äôs his real name, and we‚Äôre never given a reason why), who is obsessed with playing games on cellphones and won‚Äôt miss an opportunity to pester characters with cellphones in their hand, asking ‚ÄúWhat percentage are you at?‚Äù (as in battery life) and begging them to let him play on it while the dig is happening.

A lot of the characters are quite broad, but they are almost all given moments to show they are not simple caricatures. Just for example, the aforementioned Doctor and Gedanken both play a pivotal role in saving the day later in the story when their obsessions (games and doctrine, respectively) give each of them an opportunity to perform acts of extreme bravery in the aftermath of a tunnel collapse.

There‚Äôs a lot happening in this book, with a lot of layers to the storytelling and some quite masterful shifting between comedy, sentimentality and high-stakes drama.

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows.

Someone whispered, ""Mr. Patel's such a saint. He still sticks with her after she went nuts and hurt others with a knife.""

Another person said bitterly, ""If my wife pulled a stunt like that, I'd kick her out the same day. She's a total disgrace to Mr. Patel.""

Someone else chimed in, ""If Ms. Patterson's father hadn't passed away, and she hadn't moved in with her uncle, she would've married Mr. Patel ages ago. Audrey would never have had the chance.""

Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.

Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no-name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big-shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.

But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'They all think I don't deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself.'

It was July. The sun blazed down, but Audrey felt chilly all over, especially her heart.

Ashwood had a glossy cover story‚Äîsomething about correcting troubled youth and improving their mental state. But what went on inside was a nightmare.

Audrey, a 23-year-old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.

During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch-black isolation‚Äîuntil she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised to change.

Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.

""Zoe's ran a bath for you. Let's go home and wash off the bad luck,"" Clayton said to Audrey.

Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.

Clayton was always well-groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn't smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.

Ignoring Clayton's grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger-side door and got in.

The driver, who'd already opened the back door, glanced at Clayton in confusion.

Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn't used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.

Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn't blame her for her little temper.

He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.

Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.

It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest‚Äîhis childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three-year-old daughter, Luna Patterson.

While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn't give Clayton back to her.

Tears streamed down Valerie's face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.

Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.

Valerie stumbled into Clayton's arms, sobbing like she'd just survived a war. ""Audrey, please don't hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven't done anything. You're getting it all wrong.""

Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.

Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. ""Clayton only let us move into your house 'cause we had nowhere else to go.

""I swear I'll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don't scare my baby, okay? She's got autism.""

Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. ""Valerie's hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?""

Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton's arms, shaking like a leaf.

Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.

She thought to herself, 'So that's her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my husband's got no side piece, or I pack my bags and quit the game.'

Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. ""Believe it or not, she cut herself.""

""No way,"" Clayton shot back without missing a beat.

He was convinced no one knew Valerie's talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she'd hurt herself just to frame Audrey.

Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. ""Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You're keeping her and her kid on the side, and I'm supposed to just be cool with it?""

Clayton's colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.

""My hand... Clayton, it hurts,"" Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.

Guilt flashed across Clayton's face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, ""My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.""

Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, 'To protect that woman's reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place.'

Clayton must've caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, ""I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.

""She had a fever for days. They've had a hard time. You shouldn't trash Valerie like that.""

Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. ""I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They're living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should've been more generous, huh?""

Clayton took a deep breath and said, ""Vally doesn't blame you. She's already dropped the charges. It won't affect you.""

Audrey sneered, thinking, 'Won't affect me? Due to my so-called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.'

Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton's fathers got sick. Valerie's father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton's father.

After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.

Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie's divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.

\*\*\*\*\*

The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn't wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.

She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.

When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, ""Dinner's almost ready, ma'am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.""

Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold-rimmed glasses and said, ""Dry your hair first. I'll wait to eat with you.""

Anyone walking in might've thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.

But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.

Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, ""It's a bit late today. I'll have Zoe buy your favorite fish tomorrow.""

Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.

Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.

Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.

Now, Audrey didn't even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.

# Chapter 2 Don't Keep Pushing

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.

They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton's favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.

She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the past.

Clayton's mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton's money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she'd return it when she was sure Audrey wasn't a gold digger.

Their finances had basically been split fifty-fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame-hungry wannabe.

Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn't believe how blind she used to be.

The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman's reputation.

Clayton's hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. ""Audrey, I can explain that thing.""

From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, 'If you had anything to say, why didn't you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What's the act for now?'

She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but irritation, and he said to her, ""You can leave Ashwood once you calm down.""

He even said, ""Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you're gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it's time you felt what being truly alone is like.""

He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.

When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn't even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, 'Say what you want, Clayton won't believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you'll look.'

Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet-talking Clayton, ""Clay, the doctor just said I can't draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me 'cause she loves you too much.""

Audrey didn't hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.

She'd clenched her teeth and thought, 'If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don't drag decent people down with them. I'm not interested in his lame excuse.'

Clearly thrown by Audrey's sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, ""Why do you hate Vally so much? She's just a friend.""

Audrey didn't buy that for a second. She couldn't believe he still pretended not to know how Valerie felt for him.

After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three-year-old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.

Audrey sneered inwardly, 'What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman's husband?'

If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she'd finally go crazy one day.

She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, ""Your family owes Valerie. That's your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I'm supposed to repay your debt too?""

She thought bitterly, 'Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn't get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically.'

She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, ""You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?""

Her voice shook with rage. ""What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?""

Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.

She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.

Clayton's expression turned more serious. He hadn't expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, ""I know you lost your job, but I'll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I'll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.""

Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, 'If I fall for his crap again, I'm the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once, and what makes you think I'll believe your promise again?'

She'd seen through him completely. Clayton's heart had already gone rotten. He'd always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn't know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.

After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.

Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.

She said, ""Don't bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You're gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.""

""I'm not divorcing you,"" Clayton shot back without hesitation.

Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn't breathe. He thought, 'She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?'

The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.

For once, the always-composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. ""You lost your job, and I'll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.""

He thought he'd already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton‚Äîthe admired, respected, and untouchable top-tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should've known when to quit.

But Audrey's eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.

Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn't name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.

He muttered, ""It's all in the past. Can't we let it go?""

""Clay? Is Audrey back?"" Valerie's voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high heels.

Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical‚Äîsaving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.

However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head-to-toe brands. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was footing the bill.

She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. ""Audrey, if you've got a problem, take it out on me. My hand's ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.

""That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.""

Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. ""Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?""

Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. ""You heard her, right? That thing's a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.""

Valerie's eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless, wounded eyes toward Clayton. ""Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I‚Äî""

Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. ""Vally's already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don't need to keep pushing.""",1,1748840344.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

Have you found another who can pronounce your name correctly yet? 
I finally understand why you were so pissed off after the glitter bomb in your car, you swore revenge that fateful day. Well, you finally got it. 


Remember the day you got on a plane? You gave me a diary wrapped in that silly homemade wrapping paper. In that last embrace, tears flowing, you whispered, ""Write your hopes, dreams, poems, and lovesongs. When we meet again, you can recite them to me."" Those words still echo through my mind. 
I never opened it; I couldn't bring myself to write. How could I when you were gone?


During the week I came across that diary and carefully unwrapped it. Tears started rolling when I saw the cover: two kids dressed like mafioso fairies. Ugh God, how many hours, actually days we spent looking for those outfits?


As I opened the diary, *pop* glitter, so much glitter, your signature mix. 
Silver to shine    
blue to remind me of you    
green hearts, red hearts 2 to1    
because we have bled   
Touch of gold to make us bold    
In that cloud of sparkly joy, I heard you giggle and say, 'Who's the sparkly bitch now, C***ie'.


Memories rushed back like it was only yesterday. Sneaky sunrise coffee, hiding from the mall cops in the juice bar, getting stoned at sunset, drinking cocktails in the rain, and late night talking that went into morning. Sneaky visits whilst I was hospitalized. Even the funeral where we reconnected and so so so many more.


N***** no words will ever repair what is broken between us. How can it if you refuse to tell me what happened, What did J***** say to you? I have asked, and every time the same answer: 'I love you, really I do, I always will. But I can never forgive you.'


I am sorry that I allowed her to talk to you. I have never received as much hate mail as what your friends sent after that encounter. She really fucked up what we had planned, how we were to conquer the world, one glitter fight at a time. I was weak and blinded by lust.


This letter will never find you. I do not wish to remind you of the hurt I caused. I will always remember you fondly.
I will be cleaning glitter for months. Thank you for that, and also fuck you for that lol.

Forever in my heart

There is a lot of baggage and hurt over the last 20 years, not the least of which was he had an emotional affair and met up for coffee with an ex while I was pregnant with our second. I found out when I was in labor. 

We went through discernment counseling in February. I was willing to do a 6 month intensive therapy to see if we could save our marriage, he said no, he's not ""in love"" with me anymore.i grieved heavily and cried everyday.

Fast forward a couple weeks later and we were being civil to each other and he changed his mind and was willing to try. I said no because he said he didn't love me anymore and because I expected him to do this again in another 5 years. (we came very close to considering divorce 5 years ago and then the pandemic hit and we just ignored the elephant in the room.) 

We tried alternating sleeping on the couch for a couple weeks but eventually decided we could be fine sleeping in the same bed until STBXH moved out. There are a lot of other major life changes (new job after being a SAHM for 8 years, my parents are moving into what is now the playroom, general Maycember craziness at the kids school) so neither of us were in a hurry to move forward. We still talk everyday and say good night before bed. We hit a friendly stride. Several times we said if this was the dynamic the past few years we wouldn't be getting divorced.

Earlier this week I found out he's been dating/screwing someone and it's like I'm grieving all over again. I was angry and hurt and his defense was that we already talked about getting divorced and we already told the kids/our families so why shouldn't he be able to chase happiness. 

I kicked him out of our bedroom and it's never felt so empty. I.feel like I'm walking through the day in comatose misery.  My heart is broken in a million pieces. I keep having to stop myself from texting him or wanting to be near him. 

When is the longing and despair going to ease up? How can I get myself to stay away? Why do I miss him so much when we had

So I am a fresher in my first job (for about a year now). I have known a guy here since joining, and although I know I am not supposed to treat colleagues as friends, I did end up being best friends with him. Like we used to hang out together all the time (we are on the same team, but have different roles). Now, one thing to know about me is that I'm not out. No one knows that I am gay. But I do have a Bumble account, and one of my colleague saw this account (which mentions that I am into guys), and then told my bestie that I am gay. Since that happened, he had absolutely stopped talking to me. He actively avoids me. We used to often go out for coffee together, in breaks, and now he doesn't. Since this happened, I also stopped talking to him, out of anger and hurt. But I am having a very hard time coping with this.

I have always been a good friend to him, and we used to share everything, but now I feel that my existence bothers him. I have helped him out in some bad financial times (I lent him some money when his father needed an operation; he hasn't returned it yet), and I felt he would be there for me when I needed some support, too. 

This is not the first time I have lost someone very close to me. Actually, it's now more than a dozen very close friends whom I have lost after they found out about my orientation. 

I know I am supposed to move on, but I can't. It has been 5 months since he stopped talking, and I am having a very hard time coping with this. The fact that I have to work with him every day doesn't help. I asked ChatGPT (I know I shouldn't, but I don't have anyone to talk to), and it suggested not to justify why he left but to grieve and let go. But how do you do that even? I didn't do anything wrong. I loved him (platonically), and he is a very reserved person (as am I), and he actually opened up to a lot of things about himself to me, which made me feel very close to him.

Although I am a very confident guy but it is times like these that make me kind of regret me being born gay.

I know this is kind of sad, especially since it's pride month, but I just can't process this... I frequently break out crying when I am alone at my home.

After I wrote my last update‚Äîthe one where I admitted that Updates 4‚Äì9 were me spiraling into a beautifully delusional revenge fantasy‚ÄîI decided it was time to come back down to earth and do the work. The *actual* work. No rioting crowds, no explosive courtroom dramas‚Äîjust justice, piece by piece.

Because while it isn‚Äôt illegal to cheat, it *is* illegal to retaliate against an employee for reporting workplace misconduct. And it *is* illegal to create a hostile work environment. And it *is* illegal to fire someone without due process when protected labor rights are involved.

So, I lawyered up.

# The Legal Route

Let‚Äôs get one thing straight: I‚Äôm not suing Rachel or Ryan for cheating on me. That‚Äôs gross, yes. Traumatizing? Definitely. But not illegal.

What *is* illegal is:

* Firing me in direct retaliation after I called out unethical behavior in the workplace.
* Bypassing HR protocol and forcing me out without documentation, warnings, or mediation.
* Creating a workplace environment where favoritism and sexual relationships affected hiring, promotions, and firings.

And that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm hitting them.

I filed a formal complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). My lawyer believes we have a strong retaliation case, and we‚Äôre also looking into whether Rachel‚Äôs behavior constitutes quid pro quo sexual harassment under Title VII.

And the best part? I‚Äôm not doing this alone anymore.

# The Former Employees Speak

My former company‚Äîlet‚Äôs call it **Grayson & Chase**‚Äîisn‚Äôt the mega-conglomerate I made it out to be in my fantasy. It's a mid-sized, regional marketing firm with about 100 employees spread across three locations.

After my story started circulating (at least the *real* version), several former employees reached out to me.

And *boy*, did they have stories.

* One woman was *demoted* after refusing to go to dinner with a ‚Äúsenior partner‚Äù (hint: Rachel‚Äôs married business associate).
* A guy in accounting said he was forced out for questioning irregular expenses‚Äîlike Rachel getting reimbursed for ""client entertainment"" at a luxury spa *alone*.
* Another employee said she caught Rachel screaming at interns and threatening to blacklist them from the industry if they ‚Äúgot an attitude.‚Äù

We‚Äôre talking favoritism, intimidation, and unethical hiring/firing practices. None of it as explosive as my courtroom fantasy‚Ä¶ but all of it *very actionable.*

# The Secret Mistress

This next part honestly shocked *me*.

Someone slid into my DMs last week and introduced herself as *Ryan‚Äôs other mistress*. Not Rachel. Not me. Someone *else.*

Her name‚Äôs Kim. She‚Äôs in her twenties. Met Ryan through a work conference three years ago. She thought he was single the whole time until she ‚Äúfound me on Facebook through tagged wedding photos.‚Äù

Cool, cool, cool.

She was devastated. But now she‚Äôs *pissed*. And she wants to help.

Apparently Ryan used to rant to her about how ‚ÄúHR was in his pocket,‚Äù and that ‚ÄúRachel would cover for anything.‚Äù He told her about clients he manipulated, coworkers he sabotaged, and how ‚Äúuntouchable‚Äù he and Rachel were because they ‚Äúknew where the bodies were buried.‚Äù

So now? Kim‚Äôs cooperating. She‚Äôs given me text logs, screenshots, and even one recording. My lawyer nearly choked on his coffee when he heard it.

# Rachel‚Äôs Daughter

And then there‚Äôs *this* little gem.

Rachel has a 19-year-old daughter named Ava. I used to babysit her occasionally back in the early days of my job‚Äîbefore Rachel grew cold, calculated, and impossible to please.

Ava reached out to me a few weeks ago and said, and I quote:

>

We got coffee. We talked. I didn‚Äôt dig‚Äîshe volunteered everything.

* Ava says Rachel is emotionally manipulative, cruel, and obsessed with power.
* Apparently Rachel‚Äôs been in ‚Äúpower-couple mode‚Äù since she and Ryan got together and treats her own family like props in a LinkedIn post.
* Ava has *emails* Rachel accidentally forwarded to her, where she discusses ‚Äúleverage‚Äù she has on executives and ‚Äúhow to replace deadweight.‚Äù

Deadweight = me. Cool.

She offered to send them to my lawyer. She wants no part of her mother‚Äôs empire of lies.

# The Calm Before the Real Storm

So here we are.

No mobs. No Netflix specials.

Just facts. Documents. Testimonies. Emails. Voice recordings. And enough shady conduct to light up a courtroom like a Christmas tree.

Rachel. Ryan. Grayson & Chase.

You might not be the villains of some wild soap opera fantasy, but you *are* real-life monsters. And you‚Äôve hurt a lot of people under the radar‚Äîpeople who didn‚Äôt have the power or platform to fight back.

Well now I do.

And I‚Äôm not stopping.

Not until your names are attached to every legal filing, HR complaint, and ethics board review I can get my hands on.

Because I might not be a riot-inciting antihero with a flaming briefcase anymore‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶but I *am* your worst nightmare:

A woman with nothing to lose, a lawyer who loves receipts, and a folder titled ‚ÄúThe Fall of the Three Musketeers.‚Äù

You messed with the wrong employee.

**TL;DR:** The chaos from Updates 4‚Äì9 didn‚Äôt happen‚Äîbut *this* is real. I‚Äôve filed legal complaints against my former boss and company, connected with former employees and victims of their misconduct, discovered Ryan‚Äôs secret mistress (not even Rachel knew), and gained the support of Rachel‚Äôs own daughter. The takedown is happening‚Äîquietly, legally, and methodically. And it‚Äôs just getting started.",1,1748838643.0,StoriesMadeByAI,0,1.0,False

1l18yio,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l18yio/quitting_for_real/,Quitting for real,"I've been ""quitting"" caffeine for a while now. I stopped a few years ago because I was having some unrelated health problems, and was trying everything under the sun to fix it. But, as soon as my health improved, I started drinking tea and coffee again.

More recently, I've started to seriously question if I want this in my life. I feel like it doesn't do me any good mentally. I've noticed I get less done on weeks that I drink caffeine.

I remember once seeing a documentary about some drug, and the interviewer asked one of the addicts why he likes it. The addict said it made him feel ""powerful"". The addict said this while reclining and looking off in a limp daze, not exactly the image I would've associated with power.

Later in life, I met a guy who juggled several drugs. He confidently told me that he was in absolute control, and knew which drug to use in which circumstance (one for making art, one for passing an exam, etc). It didn't take long for me to realize that in actuality, his life was an utter mess, and he was constantly shooting himself in the foot.

It hit me that I am both of those people. Caffeine makes me *feel* capable in the moment, while hindering my capabilities and making it harder to feel capable in the long run. Even when I knew I wanted to quit, I'd think to myself ""oh, but I need to wake up early tomorrow"" or ""I have a lot of work to do today"". But when I take an honest look at the outcomes, I do much better without it.

I'm done making excuses, I'm done experimenting to see if there's some situation where it can be useful. I just want to be done with it.",6,1748838361.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

I recently purchased a Flair 58 plus. In preparation I watched numerous tutorials and workflow set up so that I would not be so far below on the learning curve with my first lever machine. 

After setting everything up and trying about 5 times to pull a decent short i began to noticed that no matter what I did different I would get maybe 2 bars of pressure. I used a post here to troubleshoot. I would like to state what I've down and see if anyone could tell me what to try next. I suspect it will be getting a better grinder. 

I have checked all gaskets for proper fit. There are no leaks in any of the area. 

I have made sure everything is assembled in sequence and tightened as per set up tutorials. 

I am using fresh beans that I roasted myself. I have Oxo Brew Conical Burr grinder as all the lowest Fine settings. I am comparing it to grinds I see online and it looks just about the same. I suspect this is where the issue is. 

When I try and pull a shot I get no resistance, the gage reads about 2 bar. I load 18g grounds and pull about 65g liquid in about 16 seconds. When I go and pull again to purge the water I see pressure, I see it go to about 5-7 bar. This is what makes me think the grind is not fine enough. 

I use a WDT. I do not have a leveler so I have ordered one and also a better WDT and a spring loaded tamper. 

I have tried doing more grounds, less grounds, more water,  less water, different temps. But nothing I see yields me any results. I've watched many videos and have done step by step follow through but nothing. 

I am considering going to my local coffee shop and asking if they will grind something for me as fine as possible to see if maybe this will give me some positive results. Even if it is too fine and I see too much resistance then I can at least be sure it is the grind level.

Any advice or ideas? ",1,1748838331.0,FlairEspresso,6,1.0,False

(but genuinely if my issues were severe I'd likely not initiate bringing it up to a therapist.)

Yet at the same time, I'm not sure how to stop minimizing them? (on occasional I will have a realization that its actually a big issue. Then I'm actually not worried about my mental health much but still going to go to therapy. 100% think I can deal with this by finding the right playlist on spotify. (hyperbole but still).

My mental health is fine(usually if its not happening this exact second) despite:

\-very frequent paranoia sometimes about hidden recording devices but frequently that others are keeping tabs on me or im being dosed. Randomly noticing other people who're keeping track of me from a distance. (uhhh was worse. Then got better. Now maybe a bit worse)

\-sometimes i sense entities and i used to hear things but not much anymore. Lately noticed seeing people(often those i know sorta? or at least i assume its those i know) in my peripheral vision just sitting around or doing regular daily things but when I look at them they're gone.. 

\-intrusive thoughts

\-sometimes randomly realizing i'm sucking the life force out of others and am responsible for people i know getting ill. Physically theres no way to do that but at the same time... my brain is weird? Somehow I feel like i'm physically different in a way that its possible.

\-random feelings of depersonalization? Like everything already ended or is about to end and we're witnessing past memories. Not dejavu-ish but more like ""we're all watching this as souls after our deaths. its too perfect to be real"".  (and sometimes this is the byproduct of coffee, but honestly coffee just amplifies ideas that were already in my mind.)

\-i used to have 0 productivity all day every day but i've fixed that mostly. (Not very well.)

\-sometimes either assuming people i know are disgusted at me or just know something or im leaking my thoughts to them.

\-recently I ""realized my paranoia was actually entities messing with my thoughts which is why i eventually would realize it made 0 sense.""

\-keep feeling like running off and ruining my life and also that i have no real motivation to finish anything in life.

\-sometimes realize things are a message and that hey ""this really awful on a personal scale event will happen and these things which could be random but sometimes i dont think they are"" are all signs that that event is going to happen and im slowly figuring out what it is.

But no my mental health is actually good. (: I listened to a nice song thus i have good mental health and eh who cares about the rest its not a big deal. (:

Like the world's already full of people who can make magnificent books. They can write better, quicker, and more confidently. 

I get that. I'm a younger writer too, and some days even the idea of writing gets me down. I struggle with adhd and have (Undiagnosed) autism. Everything comes slowly, and I can hyperfixate on certain things and doubt my abilities. 

But here's the thing: writing isn't about having it all figured out. It's not about making better content than anyone else. It's about showing up to the desk or to the school or lecture or whatever it is, and continuing to improve and become a better person and writer on your own pace.

And yeah, using Ai as a 'shortcut' can feel weird. Like, am I even the one doing any work? It feels like cheating... Is it cheating? No, the short answer is no, it's not cheating. As long as you are exploring your ideas, creating new ideas, making content that has your style or thought on it, then it's yours. Ai is like a pen, you still have to pick it up to write.

Ai can be used to keep going. Just how a friend's late-night texts of encouragement, ai has helped me get to where I am, and I know it has for many others too.

If today's the kind of day you don't feel like writing, or maybe you do, write anyway. Write something bad, something awful. Write something short, or long. Write something beautiful, or ugly. Write something funny, or sad. Don't write to impress. Write just to keep going. You'd be surprised where it can lead if you continue.

The landscape of writing is wide. It's not a single genre, or path, or style, it's a whole world. Some people write fast-paced action books. Others write kids comics. Some crawl in their stories, others bolt around like lightning. Some write along at night (Guilty), others write in a loud coffee shop with friends or music.

It's ok to be scared of what others write, or to write clumsily. Again, writing is exrtremely hard to master, very few ever truly have. You probably won't be a C.S. Lewis, or a G.K. Chesterton, or a J.R.R. Tolkien. But you can try to be the best you can. If ai helps you to simply get the words on the page, use it!

Keep writing, whatever it takes. Through the cringe lines of dialogue, through the amazing world building. Please, brothers and sisters, keep the pen, or the google doc, or whatever you use to write going. Writing is a gift, never lose it!",6,1748838119.0,WritingWithAI,0,1.0,False
