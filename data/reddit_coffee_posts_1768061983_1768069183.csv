2 months ago my life had a major crisis, major life changes happened and now I am back living with my folks for a bit while I get grounded.

I don't have a job, but do go to meetings. Haven't found any real connections there so far, but I'm the shy, sit in the back type. I drink coffee, binge shows, and watch movies.  

Short black hair, my friends say I'm attractive, but most strangers thing I'm gay. I'm super LGBTQ friendly, but straight. Idk if that's TMI or not

What else? Indy, kind of punk-ish. I just don't have tattoos or anything, but love the music and the scene. When I'm feeling more stable, I hope to find a local music scene. Who knows maybe I'll have the courage to sing one day, it's always been a dream.

IDK if my account has enough karma or age to post here.

But if my post goes through, feel free to say hi. I don't bite. You can ask me whatever, I just didnt' care to dump ALL my baggage on here. Or we can start fresh.

If I get replies, I'll try to respond to them all. But also bear with me because I'm trying to put my recovery first, which means meetings and going through the effort to get to them since I don't have a car.",1,1768069066.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

I finally found a framework that actually works for building low-friction digital assets.,"I’ve spent the last 4 years trial-and-erroring different ways to make money online. I finally found a framework that actually works for building low-friction digital assets.

I wanted to share 14 specific hacks I've learned to help you guys save time and avoid the mistakes I made:

1. **Solve ""Micro-Pain"" Points:** Don't solve a life problem; solve a 2-hour problem.
2. **Clarity > Length:** A 10-page guide that works is 10x more valuable than a 100-page book that is confusing.
3. **The ""Coffee"" Price Point:** Selling for a low price is the sweet spot for impulse buys and building trust quickly.
4. **Validation First:** Don't spend a month building. Spend 48 hours on a ""Version 1"" to see if anyone even wants it.
5. **Use Social Proof:** Once you get your first sale, share that it's working! It builds immediate credibility.
6. **Focus on Workflows:** Passive income isn't a magic trick; it's a repeatable system you can run over and over.
7. **Organize your ""Digital Office"":** Separate your brainstorming time from your execution time to avoid burnout.
8. **Build for 2026:** People want fast, actionable roadmaps, not long-winded theory.
9. **Be Transparent:** If you use tools like AI to help you, be honest about it.
10. **Value First:** Provide 10x more value in the community than you do in your pitches.
11. **The ""Loop"" over the ""Launch"":** Every customer question is a clue for your next update. Use feedback to grow.
12. **Own Your Traffic:** Don't rely on just one platform; build a way to reach your audience directly.
13. **Compound Your Assets:** One guide is a side hustle; five guides are a business.
14. **Focus on ""Evergreen"" Value:** Solve a problem people will still have 12 months from now to ensure steady income.

I’m happy to chat in the comments if you have questions about how to get started or how to find your first ""micro-pain"" point!

Just curious to know what is the general consensus when it comes to paying when dating in 2026?

For example, I would always pay for first dates because I am the one 99.9% of the time who asks the other person out and I think it's a gentleman thing to do. 

However, after a few dates, is it a red flag when women don't offer to pay or expect men to pay for all the dates? I noticed some difference between cultures. 

For example, when I went out with women who were raised in North America, some of them either offered to split the bill on first dates or cover small things (like coffee, snacks) after I pay for the meals.

However, I also have went out with women who recently moved from Eastern Europe or Asia where they expected me to pay for everything during a date. (Meals, smaller things like coffee, bubble tea, snacks, Uber/taxi to send them home, I don't have a car).

First date, sure, I wouldn't mind paying for smaller things as well but after seeing them for a longer period of time and this continues, is it somewhat normal in dating that men are expected to pay for everything on a date?",2,1768069003.0,AsianMasculinity,0,1.0,False

So when i was alerted that my day and time was available I had to strike.

Next was my husband - he pays a monthly amount to a coffee shop near his work for unlimited coffee (it’s like $20 a month or something) and he said they offered him a full year with a $100 discount so he just said yes paid up front for the full year. That happened to be on the same day as I booked the party 🫠 Not a great day for our bank account

Third is harder for me emotionally and where I was struggling the most with my mindset. I have a young child family member (9yo) that lives out of state. He came to stay with his dad to visit for christmas/ new years. Unfortunately his dad has severe mental health issues and struggles badly with alcoholism, and there was an incident that was very concerning, so my siblings and I had to intervene and remove child from that person’s care for the remainder of the visit. For the time child was with me I really wanted to make sure they had fun after witnessing something that I’m sure was traumatizing and scary for them. So I set aside my no buy rules for that time period to make sure the kid would have good memories of Christmas and new years rather than focusing on the negative things that happened. We did a lot of fun stuff, got pizza and soda, junk food at the grocery store for movie nights, a Christmas gift for the kid, etc. It was a pretty large expense at the end of it but I felt it was my responsibility as the temporary guardian of the kid to make sure we did a lot of fun stuff before he went back. I don’t regret doing any of it, and occasional family outings are on my green light list. But just all of these big expenses back to back hurts when I’m looking at my expense log 😬

Kid is home as of today so I am going to try to get back on track - except the only problem is we leave for vacation in a few days which is going to be another huge money sink. I’m going to stick to my no buy rules there as well as much as possible, although I named a few specific exemptions for certain souvenirs I want to get for my son.

It’s just hard because I was all geared up to have a really good start to this, but within just a few days all my plans and budgeting were completely blown. I am excited for this vacation, but also ready to get back to normal life again so I’ll be relieved when we have all of this out of the way and can really refocus on my goals for this year, which is to increase my savings for certain house repairs, for my baby’s 529 account, and starting a retirement account for myself as a stay at home parent.",1,1768068964.0,nobuy,0,1.0,False
1q9b7ah,https://i.redd.it/al47kwjpckcg1.jpeg,Why do my oatmilk lattes taste so gross? [Breville Bambino plus],"Hi! Wondering what I’m doing wrong here. My shots look and taste great with perfect crema. If anything I might go a little darker or more acidic with my beans, but for the most part I’m really happy with my shots.

But when it comes to frothing the oatmilk and drinking the latte, I’m so disappointed. I feel like I’m ruining my perfect shots :(

I am using the barista oatly (if you have other brand recs im open to this! It’s just been hard for me to find other options in town). I make sure it’s cold, shake it up. Let the steamer run for a sec and heat it up before submerging the milk. I feel like I’ve finally gotten a good motion on the milk swirling perfectly as I froth. I do the thing where I let some air rip for 6-8 seconds then when the cup is too hot to touch, I submerge the prong deeper so less air gets in.

The milk will look PERFECT in the cup I frothed it in. I let it sit for about 8-11 seconds. I tap it on the counter. It’s nice and glossy. To the eye looks like a glossy thick milk.

However, when I pour into the cup with my espresso, what comes out looks like 1% dairy milk! It’s so thin as it pours from the spout. It looks ok in the latte cup I guess as it mixes and it gets slightly frothier near the end of the pour. I don’t care a ton about latte art, but tends to have a little froth sit up top. First few sips- texture is great. After about 3 minutes the whole thing goes flat. Tastes like I’m drinking dairy milk.. I can barely finish it. Grosses me out bc it just tastes like a cup of warm thin milk…

Any tips? I’ve been learning with watching a lot of tutorials that basically say the same thing. Whenever I first take a sip my thought is “this tastes so mid” Like a disappointing drive thru coffee

1q9b36s,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q9b36s/me_and_bobby_mcgee/,Me and Bobby McGee,"Janis met Bobby on a Thursday that smelled like rust and honeysuckle. The kind of day that made you believe in second chances even if you hadn’t used up your first. She was young, free and, barefoot in a gas station parking lot, humming something half-blues, half-prayer. He was leaning against a Harley that wasn’t his, chewing on a toothpick like it owed him money.

They didn’t fall in love. They walked into it. Slow. Careful. Like stepping into a river you ain’t sure is shallow.

Bobby had a laugh that made you forget your name and a way of looking at you like you were the last truth left in the world. Janis had a voice that could bruise a man’s pride and a heart that didn’t know how to ask for anything. She gave. That’s what she did. Gave her songs, her time, her body, her silence. But never her claim.

They rode together. Through Louisiana heat and Mississippi rain. Slept in the back of a pickup, made love under stars that didn’t blink. They shared cigarettes, secrets, and the kind of dreams that don’t survive daylight. Janis would sing to him, soft and low, like she was trying to stitch the world back together with melody. Bobby would listen, always listening, like her voice was the only map he needed.

But love, real love, don’t just want to be felt. It wants to be named. Wants to be held up in the light and called mine.

Janis couldn’t do that.

She’d seen what claiming did. Her mama claimed a man who broke her teeth and her spirit. Her sister claimed a boy who left her with two babies and a scar that ran deeper than skin. Janis had learned early: freedom was safer than forever.

So when Bobby asked—quietly, like a man already knowing the answer—“You ever think about settling down?” she just smiled that crooked smile of hers and said, “Ain’t no such thing as settling when you born to roam.”

He didn’t argue. Bobby wasn’t the arguing kind. He just kissed her forehead like a benediction and said, “I love you, Janis. But I need someone who’ll love me out loud.”

And then he was gone.

No slammed doors. No screaming. Just the sound of boots on gravel and the echo of a goodbye that never got spoken.

Janis didn’t cry. Not then. Not the next day. Not even when she saw him months later in a diner off Route 61, holding hands with a girl who wore her love like a badge. She just nodded, lit a cigarette, and walked out before he could see her.

But the music changed.

Her songs got heavier. Not sadder—wiser. Like she’d swallowed the whole sky and was trying to sing it back out. She sang of freedom, yes. But now there was a tremble in it. A knowing. That freedom, real freedom, ain’t the absence of chains. It’s the courage to choose your own.

Years passed. Janis played juke joints and backwoods bars, her voice dragging ghosts out of men’s chests. Folks said she sang like she’d lived a thousand lives. But she’d only lived one. One that started and ended with Bobby McGee.

Then one night, in a town too small to matter, she saw him again. Older now. Softer. The girl was gone. He was alone, sipping coffee like it was penance.

He looked up. Saw her. And smiled.

“Still running?” he asked.

She laughed. “Still singing.”

They didn’t talk about the past. Didn’t need to. It was there, in the way he still leaned forward when she spoke. In the way she still looked away when he did.

“I used to think I lost you,” she said, finally.

“You didn’t lose me,” he said. “You just never held me.”

They sat in silence, the kind that don’t need filling. Then he stood, dropped a twenty on the table, and said, “Take care, Janis.”

She watched him walk away again. But this time, her heart didn’t break. It opened.

Because now she understood.

Loving someone doesn’t mean keeping them. Sometimes it means letting them go so they can find the kind of love you’re too wild to give. And that’s not failure. That’s grace.

She stepped outside, lit a cigarette, and looked up at the stars. They blinked back at her, like they’d been waiting.

She whispered into the night, “Freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose.”

And for the first time, she believed it. Not because she had nothing.

But because she had everything she needed.

A voice. A road. And the memory of a love that taught her how to be free.

Justin Bobby pulled up in front of her and he modest but extremely clean car. He rolled down the window with that familiar smile, and asked “do you need a ride?”

Janis whispered back “yes.” ",1,1768068682.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Just as I was starting to get optimistic about Anaheim’s potential, they decided to go and lose 8 games in a row. I’ll be honest, I think this matchup is going to get ugly fast – the Sabres have won 13 of their last 14 outings, and they’ve won their last 5 straight home games. Assuming Luukkonen will get the start, the home team should come into this encounter with every advantage. Meanwhile, the Ducks have lost their last 4 road games by at least 3 goals.

I nodded, smiled, half-listened while buttering toast, content in the small domestic rhythm of the morning.

After breakfast we migrated to the living room. I let him choose the YouTube videos; today it was mostly people doing insane parkour in abandoned buildings and some extremely satisfying kinetic sand cutting compilations. He laughed at all the right moments, head thrown back, the sound bright and unguarded. I watched him more than the screen.

Around noon he dragged me to his room to play games. We took turns on his Switch—Mario Kart first, then he insisted on us playing co-op in some survival crafting game where we died repeatedly to spiders because I kept forgetting to build a roof. He didn’t get frustrated the way adults do; every death was just another chance to laugh at how badly Dad played. I loved those hours. The outside world didn’t exist. There was only the soft click of controllers, his delighted shouts when we finally survived the night, and the warmth of his small shoulder pressed against mine.

Nothing felt ominous. Nothing felt wrong.

The day slipped by in comfortable pieces: lunch (grilled cheese and tomato soup), more YouTube (some science experiments with vinegar and baking soda that ended in glorious foam explosions on the kitchen table), then board games until the light outside turned the color of old gold.

Dinner was simple—pasta with meat sauce, Elias’s favorite. He ate two helpings, proud of his “big appetite,” then helped clear the table without being asked. My wife kissed the top of his head and told him he was growing up too fast.

At 6:55 p.m. he suddenly looked up from the coloring book he’d been working on and said, very casually, “Dad, can you get my sleigh ready? I want to go sledding.”

I glanced at the window. It had snowed heavily the night before; the backyard and the hill behind our house were perfect. The sky had gone the deep navy of early winter evening, streetlights just beginning to glow.

“Yeah sure, kiddo,” I said. “Get your stuff on. Boots, coat, gloves—the whole deal.”

He grinned, that wide, slightly crooked grin that always showed the gap where he’d lost a tooth two weeks earlier, and bolted upstairs.

I went down to the basement. The sleigh was an old wooden one my father had given me when I was Elias’s age—red paint chipped in places, runners still sharp. I dusted off the cobwebs, checked the ropes, felt a small swell of nostalgia. These were the moments you saved up for, the ones you hoped your children would remember.

When I came back up carrying the sleigh, Elias was already waiting at the door to the basement stairs. I thought at first he was impatient, bouncing on his toes like he sometimes did. But he was just… standing. Perfectly still.

“You ready?” I asked, smiling.

No answer.

He simply stared.

And in the dim light of the hallway bulb I finally looked—really looked—at his eyes.

They were wrong.

My son has warm brown eyes, the same color as my mother’s, deep and soft like melted chocolate. The eyes watching me now were bright, glacial blue. Not contacts, not trick lighting. Wrong. Alien. Impossible.

The grin was still there, stretched across his face, but it no longer belonged to my child. It was something wearing my son’s face like a mask that didn’t quite fit.

My stomach dropped through the floor.

“Who are you?” My voice cracked. “Where is my son?”

The thing tilted its head, the motion too fluid, too precise. “Dad…” it said in Elias’s voice, soft and sweet, “I am your son.”

“NO YOU’RE NOT!” The shout tore out of me, raw and ragged. My heart was slamming so hard I could taste metal in my mouth.

I didn’t think. I simply reacted.

I swung the wooden sleigh with every ounce of strength terror and fury could give me. The edge of the runner caught the thing across the temple. There was a sickening crack, a soft thud as the body dropped like a puppet with its strings cut.

I ran.

I sprinted through the house calling his name—Elias! Elias!—up the stairs, into his bedroom, into the bathroom, into our bedroom. Nothing. Silence.

Then I heard my wife scream from downstairs.

I found him in the hallway, collapsed near the front door, coat half-on, one mitten still dangling from his wrist. His face was gray. No breath. No pulse.

I started CPR, counting compressions, breathing into his mouth, tasting salt and panic. My wife was on the phone, voice shaking, begging for help.

The paramedics arrived in seven minutes. They tried. They really tried.

But he was already gone.

They said massive heart attack. Sudden. Unexplained in a healthy eight-year-old boy. No history of heart problems. No warning signs. Just… gone.

The police asked questions. They looked at the sleigh lying on its side in the basement doorway, at the bruise already blooming across the thing’s face. But the thing on the floor had Elias’s brown eyes again. The blue was gone. When they rolled it over, it was my son. My dead son. The coroner would later say the head injury was caused by falling down the stairs. An accident. Tragic. Understandable in the chaos of grief.

No one believed me.

Not the police. Not the doctors. Not my wife, though she tries. She thinks I’m broken because I lost my boy. She thinks the things I say late at night are the ramblings of a man who can’t accept reality. She still sets a place for him at the table sometimes, out of habit or hope. I can’t bear to move the plate.

But I know.

I saw the blue eyes. I heard the too-perfect imitation of my son’s voice. I felt the wrongness coming off that thing in waves—cold, patient, amused.

Something was here. Something that wore my child like clothing. Something that waited until the clock turned to seven. Something that wanted me to see it. To know.

And whatever it was… it took him.

It took him, and it left me behind with the knowledge that there are things in the world that can look like the people we love most, smile with their mouths, speak with their voices—and still not be them.

Ten years have passed.

The house is quieter now. The toys are packed away. His room is a guest room no one ever uses. I still check every pair of eyes that meet mine—cashiers, neighbors, strangers on the street. I still wake up some nights hearing small footsteps on the stairs, waiting for the moment they stop at my door and a voice says, soft and sweet:

“Dad… I am your son.”

I wait for the eyes.

And every time, I pray they are brown.

It was a perfectly ordinary Saturday, the kind you don’t even think about while it’s happening because nothing marks it as special.

Today's prayer and meditation softly remind me that words and examples carry a quiet power. A life lived in faith becomes a living message. Through that faith, our Creator unfolds a new way of living, and, in time, shows us how meaningful this work truly is.

When I first read this, my ego quickly leaned in. Will I be showing how important I am? The ego is clever, it rarely goes silent on its own.

But the truth gently corrected me. It is not really my importance that matters, it is the work.

When I humbly ask, ""Thy will be done, not mine,"" something magical shifts. I begin to give full credit to a Power greater than myself. Whether my ego approves or resists does not concern God, he cares not, but my faith grows every time I surrender even a thread of the credit.

**God did not fix me. God redirected me.**

God did not erase my ego overnight.

God did not make me perfect.

God did not turn me into a saint.

As I have heard from many speakers in AA, those having this similar spiritual experience. I have experienced the same. 

**What God did was far better.** 

I was redirected, from *self* to usefulness.

And I discovered a truth that continues to guide my life.

**When I focus on helping others, God takes care of me far better than I ever could.**

Whenever I try to manage my image, my comfort, or the outcome of life. When I attempt to fix, manage, control or manipulate, I almost always end up entangled and restlessly discontent.

**Whenever I try to be useful, life unfolds naturally.**

That is the new way of life, and it works.

From my experience; God felt closest to me, in my children's birthing rooms, seeing my sons and daughters born, but He is no less present at an AA coffee table.

The conversation was going really well, and she seemed genuinely interested. She even shared a poem she had written herself. Everything felt good.
Then we shifted into whatsapp. We were taking nicely for few days. She trusted me enough to talk about her family as well .We even planned to meet. She lived about 9 km away, and I suggested we grab coffee sunday . She said yes.,  but Then, two days later, on Friday night, she suddenly stopped replying to me.so I thought I’d message her the next day. When I did, her replies felt different—short and dry, as if she was just responding out of politeness. It felt like I was more interested than she was.
So I took a step back and stopped messaging her. Yesterday, when I checked, I saw that she had left the chat in dating app . I even thought about messaging her in whatsapp again, but then I realized we had only been talking for a week or ten days, and I had already tried twice. She didn’t seem interested anymore, so I decided to let it be. I gave up and didn’t message her again.
I was in a relationship for four years and have been single for about two and a half years now. This was the first time I had talked to a girl so deeply since my breakup. Maybe I don’t know how to keep conversations exciting anymore, or maybe something changed on her side.

However, my friends keep asking me out for drinks and to socialize without my baby involved. I understand the importance of still having my sense of self without my new “mom” title - however, I’m still healing physically from the labor, but my sense of self I’d like to regain is being able to go back to doing yoga once I’m healed, finding time for baking, etc. I knew when I signed up for parenthood that I would not be going out drinking like I did in my 20s. Besides the hobbies I’m looking to regain, my world truly revolves around my little one now. I worked so hard for her to be here, she was worth every literal blood, sweat, and tear, but I kind of thought that I would be able to keep my old friendships, but just with my baby involved now. Once I am physically ready and also ready to bring baby out more, I’d love to have dinner with friends with baby on my lap, or get coffee with baby in her stroller next to us (I am not ready for that yet). The only form of socializing I am getting invited to is to go out for drinks. Nobody asks how the baby is. Nobody asks how I am doing. It’s just invitations I keep turning down. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I feel awkward continuously saying “no” to these invitations. Is it going to come to a point where they just stop inviting me and I’ve just lost these friendships, and I have to find new people? 

For context, some of these friends have children and all of them know the work it took to get to this point of having a child. ",2,1768067927.0,NewParents,6,1.0,False

After 4 years of testing different side hustles, I’ve finally realized that the secret to success in 2026 is building high-value, low-friction digital products.

Since I just had my first few sales on my breakdown today, I wanted to pass on 14 specific lessons I've learned to help you guys get a head start:

1. **Solve ""Micro-Pain"" Points:** Don't solve a life problem; solve a 2-hour problem.
2. **Prioritize Clarity over Length:** A 10-page guide that works is better than a 100-page book that is confusing.
3. **The ""Coffee"" Price Point:** Selling for a low price is the ""sweet spot"" for impulse buys and building trust quickly.
4. **Validation First:** Don't spend a month building. Spend 48 hours on a ""Version 1"" to see if anyone wants it.
5. **Use ""Social Proof"":** Once you get your first sale, tell people! It shows your product is real and working.
6. **Focus on Workflows:** Passive income isn't a ""set it and forget it"" magic trick; it's a repeatable system.
7. **Organize your ""Digital Office"":** Separate your brainstorming time from your execution time to avoid burnout.
8. **Build for 2026:** People want fast, actionable roadmaps, not long-winded theory.
9. **Be Transparent:** If you use tools like AI to help you, be honest about it. Authenticity is a superpower on Reddit.
10. **Community is King:** Provide 10x more value in comments than you do in your sales pitch.
11. **The ""Loop"" over the ""Launch"":** Don't just launch and stop. Every customer question is a clue for your next update. Improving your product based on real feedback is what creates long-term passive income.
12. **Own Your Traffic:** Don't just rely on one platform. Use social media to drive people to a simple landing page or email list. This way, you aren't at the mercy of an algorithm change.
13. **Compound Your Assets:** One guide is a side hustle; five guides are a business. Once you find a workflow that works, repeat it for different ""Micro-Pain"" points in the same niche.
14. **Focus on ""Evergreen"" Value:** Trends die fast. Solve a problem that people will still have 12 months from now. That is the difference between a quick buck and a steady income stream.

1q9aeql,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lightroom/comments/1q9aeql/mobile_solution_to_speed_up_my_workflow/,Mobile solution to speed up my workflow,"Hey everyone,

My current PC is 14 years old - as soon as I launch Lightroom, CPU usage spikes to 100% - and after just a few clicks, I’m stuck waiting. Working with masks is especially painful - the brush lags so badly that it takes forever. I do have 32 GB of RAM - but usage usually stays between 11-18 GB.

I save my edited photos to an external SSD.

Since I’m often on the go - I’m looking for a mobile solution to streamline and speed up my photo workflow. Right now, I spend more time waiting for Lightroom to respond than actually editing - and I’d love to change that.

Here’s my typical workflow:
- Sony a6700 (26 MP) - 100-1000 photos per session
- Transfer to laptop - quick preview is important
- Select and flag photos for editing
- Apply AI Denoise depending on ISO
- Use sliders - AI masks (sky - architecture) - object detection
- Edit individual masks (currently almost impossible)
- Export final images

I don’t mind if import, export or denoise take a bit longer - I usually grab a coffee during that. What matters most is smooth editing - especially when working with masks and adjustments.

I don’t do video production or gaming - this laptop is purely for photo editing.

After researching here and elsewhere - I’m currently considering a MacBook with the M4 Pro chip - 32 GB RAM - and 1 TB SSD. I’m pretty sure it would handle my workflow easily - but I’m also wondering if it’s overkill and I’d never really push it to its limits.

So here are my questions:
- Which MacBook would you recommend for my workflow?
- Is the M4 Pro with 32 GB and 1 TB too much?
- Are there (non-Apple) alternatives that offer similar performance for less money?

I would like to use the laptop for a long time and not buy a new model in a few years.

I  am still currently trying to find the right combination of meds to effectively manage it.

Before this, I was an active, fit and healthy person. I backpacked across Latin American alone, I had a job that allowed me to live in different countries. I was energetic and social. I now live with my spouse on a different continent to the rest of my family and friends and can barely leave the house due to my illness. Even small pleasures like a hot shower or cup of coffee flare up my symptoms.

I am finding it really difficult to accept and surrender to my situation. I spend a lot of time alone at home while my spouse works and while I have done an immense amount of reflection and trauma healing with my therapist, I find myself continuously grieving my old life. I feel like this is not because I identified with what I did as a 'traveler' or 'adventurer', but more because this amount of isolation that comes with disability is not natural. It's lonely and difficult.

I know I must accept what is because I cannot radically change anything at this time. But I'm not able to go into the now 24/7 while I'm stuck in the same room all day everyday.

In my profile, under Listings→ Listing Editor —> Guest Safety→ Safety Considerations, there’s a checkbox for “Not a good fit for infants under 2” and another checkbox for “Not a good fit for children 2 – 12”.  

I have these checked, and before I uncheck them and advertise for kids, I want to be set up.

My question: I have nightstands with glass covers over them.  In past posts, the consensus seemed to be not to worry about lamps on nightstands, as guest parents can move them.  Should I worry about a toddler pulling the glass cover onto himself?  It is about a 1/4"" thick, so somewhat heavy.  

  
I could, of course, remove the glass, but then soon enough somebody will be putting down a mug of hot coffee and destroying the finish.

Replacing it with a cloth cover just gives the toddler something else to grab onto and pull the lamp/alarm clock/whatever that's on the nightstand onto himself.

And for context, I do offer a pack and play, stroller, high chair, outlet plugs, and kiddy gates.  We will be bolting all dressers and shelves to the wall and putting up cord cleats (to wrap blind cords out of reach).

1q9adrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanficActionRomance/comments/1q9adrh/leon_and_mira_chaotic_love_story/,Leon and Mira (Chaotic love Story),"Chapter 13: Three Couples, One Guild Hall, Endless Chaos

Fairy Tail’s guild hall was buzzing louder than usual. The air was thick with gossip after Leon had successfully turned the teasing spotlight onto Natsu and Lucy the day before.

But today… the chaos reached new heights.
The doors opened again, and the last person anyone expected stepped through.

“Jellal?” Erza’s voice cut the noise instantly.
The blue-haired mage walked in cautiously, his expression unreadable. For a moment, the guild went still—tension hanging in the air.

And then…
“OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH!” the guild roared.


*Round One: Jellal and Erza

“ERZA’S BOYFRIEND IS HERE!” Cana bellowed, slamming her mug on the counter.
Erza’s face immediately went crimson.

“H-he’s not—!”
Jellal’s eyes widened as if he’d walked into a battlefield unarmed. “Wait, no, it’s not like that—”

“Oh, it’s exactly like that,” Leon cut in smoothly from his seat at the bar, smirking as he raised his glass. “Look at you two. The tension’s thicker than Natsu’s skull.”

“HEY!” Natsu shouted from across the room.
“Not wrong,” Gray muttered, arms crossed.
Jellal coughed, flustered. “I… I came here on business.”
“Business?” Levy teased, scribbling furiously in her notebook. “That what the kids are calling it these days?”

The guild howled.

Even Bickslow’s dolls chanted, “Kiiiissss her! Kiiiissss her!”
Evergreen pushed her glasses up, smirking. “Honestly, it’s about time someone flustered Erza.”

“ERZA SCARLET, FLUSTERED! THIS IS A MAN’S MAN!” Elfman bellowed, tears in his eyes.

Erza’s face went redder than her hair as she slammed her fist onto the table. “ENOUGH!”
The table splintered. The guild roared with laughter.

Jellal just sighed, looking like he regretted every life choice that led him here.


*Round Two: Passing the Torch Again

Lucy, still recovering from yesterday’s spotlight, grinned mischievously. “Well, Erza, at least now they’ll stop teasing me and Natsu.”

“WHAT?!” Natsu nearly fell off his chair. “We’re not a thing!”
“Keep telling yourself that,” Leon said with a smirk.
Lucy buried her face in her hands. “This is never going to end…”


*Mira’s Perspective

At the bar, Mira leaned against the counter, watching the chaos unfold. For once, the teasing wasn’t directed at her. She could breathe. She could enjoy.

Until Cana slid over with a sly grin. “Relieved, huh? Someone else finally under fire?”
Mira’s cheeks warmed. “I-I’m not—”

Cana chuckled. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. We all see it. You like it when Leon stirs the pot. Keeps you on your toes, huh?”

Mira sputtered. “That man is insufferable.”
From a few stools down, Leon lifted his glass without even looking. “Love you too, sunshine.”

Mira smacked the counter. “I DIDN’T SAY THAT!”
The guild roared even harder.


*The Triple Roast

Now the entire guild hall was in full swing.

Leon and Mira: “Married in spirit, divorced in temper.”

Natsu and Lucy: “Childhood sweethearts in denial.”

Jellal and Erza: “Tragic star-crossed lovers, doomed to blush forever.”

Every corner of the hall rang with chants, laughter, and jeers. Bets were placed, mugs were raised, and by the end of it, even Makarov was wiping tears of laughter from his eyes.

“Three pairs!” the old master bellowed. “Fairy Tail’s got more romance than jobs these days!”
“MAKE IT STOP!” Lucy screamed.
“NEVER!” Happy cackled.

Even Erza, the Titania, couldn’t escape—it took her nearly breaking another table to calm everyone down.


*The Aftermath

As the chaos settled into drunken laughter and stories, Leon leaned back in his seat, smug grin plastered on his face.

Mirajane crossed her arms, glaring at him. “You’re awful, you know that?”
He smirked. “Awful? Nah. I just share the suffering. Fair’s fair.”
Her lips twitched despite herself. “…You’re lucky you’re handsome.”

Leon froze for half a second—just long enough for her to smirk back before turning away, cheeks pink.
The guild was too busy laughing at Jellal and Erza to notice.
But Leon noticed. Oh, he definitely noticed.


Chapter 14: Fairy Festival of Chaos

Fairy Tail was many things. Loud. Destructive. Infamous.
But if there was one thing it did better than fighting, it was partying.

Magnolia’s annual Guild Festival Day was in full swing, with the Fairy Tail guild hall transformed into a carnival of food stalls, banners, and competitions. Townsfolk gathered in droves, eager to watch the rowdy guild put on a show.

And inside the guild hall? Absolute chaos.
The Announcement
Makarov, standing on the bar counter with his tiny frame puffed up proudly, raised his staff.

“Ladies and gentlemen, brats of Fairy Tail and guests from Magnolia!” he boomed. “Today’s festival is about joy, unity, and above all—humiliation!”

The guild roared.

Mira, dressed in a cute festival outfit (against her will), smiled sweetly. “Oh, I just love this day!”

Leon, sitting nearby with his jacket slung lazily over his chair, smirked. “What, because it’s the one day you’re legally allowed to bully people?”

“You mean I don’t do that every day?” she shot back.
“Touché,” he chuckled, clinking his glass.


*Contest One: Eating Competition

The first event: a ramen-eating contest.
“GO, GO, GO!” the crowd chanted as Natsu and Gajeel stuffed bowls down like wild animals.

Lucy sat beside them, groaning. “Why do I feel like I’m going to regret this?”
“Because you always do,” Leon called from the crowd, smirking.

Lucy shot him a glare. “Don’t you have a contest to lose to Mira?”
The crowd oohed. Leon grinned.

“Sweetheart, I don’t lose to anyone. Unless she rigs it.”
Mira twirled her hair, smiling angelically. “Oh, I always rig it.”

*Contest Two: Couple Relay Race

Then came the relay race—but with a twist. Pairs had to run three-legged, tied together.

“Pair one: Natsu and Lucy!” 

the announcer boomed.

Lucy screamed. “WHY AM I ALWAYS TIED TO HIM?!”

“Pair two: Erza and Jellal!”

The crowd gasped as Erza froze, red-faced. Jellal looked like he’d rather fight Acnologia.

“Pair three…” 

The announcer grinned wickedly. “

…Mira and Leon!”

The guild exploded.

Mirajane’s smile twitched dangerously. “Who signed us up for this?”
“Happy,” Leon guessed instantly.
“Aye, sir!” Happy laughed from the sky, munching a fish.

Leon smirked as he leaned close while the rope was tied around them. “Relax, sunshine. You get to cling to me guilt-free.”
Mira’s blush could’ve lit fireworks. “I’ll trip you on purpose.”
“Wouldn’t be the first time you swept me off my feet.”

The crowd howled.
The race itself was pure chaos—Natsu and Lucy fell immediately, Jellal tripped over his own cape, and Leon ended up carrying Mira halfway across the finish line like some smug knight.
They didn’t win. But the crowd loved it.


*Contest Three: “Best Couple” Showdown

And then came the final humiliation: the Best Couple Contest, voted on by the townsfolk.

Natsu and Lucy? Denying everything.

Erza and Jellal? Blushing statues.

Mira and Leon? Bickering like cats and dogs.

“Couple number three,” the announcer said, “please give us a demonstration of your chemistry!”

Mira froze. “Chemistry?!”
Leon grinned, stepping forward with zero hesitation. “Gladly.” He slipped an arm around her waist, leaned close enough to make her breath catch, and whispered just loud enough for the crowd:

“Ready to give ’em a show, sweetheart?”
Mira’s face turned crimson. “Y-you—!”
The crowd screamed with laughter and cheers, and the vote ended in their favor.
They were crowned “Best Couple,” to Mira’s utter mortification and Leon’s eternal smugness.

*The Shadow

The night ended with fireworks, drinks, and laughter echoing through Magnolia. For once, the guild was united in pure joy.
But as the last firework faded into smoke, Leon caught sight of a shadow moving just beyond the festival lights.

Something unnatural. Something wrong.
His smile faltered, just for a heartbeat. Then he looked back at Mira laughing with her siblings, and forced it back into place.
The storm was coming.

But tonight… they had earned their laughter.

Chapter 15: The Calm Before the Storm

The morning after the festival, Fairy Tail’s guild hall was quieter than usual. A hangover haze hung in the air as guild members nursed sore heads and full stomachs.

Leon sat at the bar with his usual cup of black coffee, his hair still slightly mussed from last night’s chaos. Mirajane, of course, was already bright and smiling, refilling mugs as though she hadn’t been crowned “Best Couple” with him in front of the entire town.

“You’re awfully chipper,” Leon muttered, squinting at her.

She smirked. “And you’re unusually quiet. Don’t tell me you’re embarrassed about last night.”

He raised an eyebrow, sipping his coffee. “Embarrassed? Sweetheart, I carried you across that finish line like a knight in shining armor. The people loved it.”

Her blush betrayed her. “Y-you’re impossible.”

Before he could quip back, the doors slammed open.

“Urgent news!”

A Rune Knight staggered in, his armor scorched and dented. The guild fell silent.


*The Reports

Makarov hopped down from his seat, staff clacking. “What is it, soldier?”
The Knight bowed, panting. “The western villages… three more destroyed. No survivors. We found claw marks, blood trails, and… bodies twisted beyond recognition.”
The hall tensed. Even Natsu stopped mid-bite.

Leon’s jaw clenched. He already knew what it was. He’d seen it too many times before.

“B.O.W.s,” he muttered under his breath.

Gray frowned. “B.O… what now?”

“Bio-Organic Weapons,” Leon said grimly, loud enough for the hall. “Monsters born from experiments. They don’t just kill—they spread.”

The guild buzzed with uneasy whispers.
Makarov slammed his staff to silence them. “Enough. This threat is unlike anything Fiore has faced before. And we cannot take it lightly.”

*The Briefing

Maps were spread across the main table, markers placed on the western border. Levy analyzed the reports, her brow furrowed.
“These attacks… they’re spreading faster than expected. If this continues, they’ll reach Magnolia within weeks.”

Erza’s fists tightened. “Then we must stop them at the source.”

“Easier said than done,” Leon cut in. “Trust me, these things don’t go down easy. You’ll need firepower, teamwork, and no hesitation. They don’t feel fear. They don’t feel pain. They just… keep coming.”

The room fell heavy with his words.


*The Pairing

Makarov looked around the hall, then let his gaze land on Mirajane.
“Mira,” he said firmly. “Your strength and control will be vital against these creatures.”
Mirajane straightened, nodding.

“And Leon,” Makarov continued, “you’ve faced these things before. You know their weaknesses, their patterns. That makes you the key to this mission.”

Leon exhaled slowly, already expecting what was coming.
“You two will lead the strike team.”

The guild erupted.

“OH COME ON!” Natsu shouted, slamming his fist on the table. “Why do they get to lead?!”

“Because they’re the married couple!” Cana hollered, already raising a mug.

“WE ARE NOT—!” Mira started, red-faced.

“Yet,” Leon added smoothly, smirking at her.
The guild howled, but this time the laughter was uneasy, tinged with nerves.

Because everyone could feel it now.
This wasn’t just another silly mission. This was the beginning of something big.


*The Shift

As the briefing ended, the guild dispersed in smaller groups, preparing gear and double-checking supplies.

Leon lingered by the map table, his eyes tracing the red markers of destroyed villages. His smirk was gone, replaced with the cold, calculating stare of a man who’d lived this nightmare before.

Mira approached quietly, her usual brightness dimmed. “You’ve seen this before, haven’t you?”
Leon didn’t look up. “Too many times.”
“…And it scares you.”

He finally glanced at her, surprised by the softness in her voice. She wasn’t teasing. She wasn’t mocking. She was just… there.
“More than I’d admit out loud,” he said honestly.

She smiled faintly, though her eyes were serious. “Then it’s a good thing you’re not alone this time.”

Leon blinked, caught off guard. For once, he had no smooth reply. Just a quiet nod.
The storm was coming.
And for the first time in years, Leon Kennedy wasn’t facing it alone.


Chapter 16: Sparks Before the Inferno


The sun never seemed so heavy. Clouds pressed low over Magnolia, the air damp and restless, like the city itself was holding its breath. Inside Fairy Tail’s guild hall, however, chaos reigned—not the fun, festival kind, but the desperate, sharpen-your-swords-and-pray kind.

“hey Gray, put on some clothes before the briefing!” Elfman barked, slamming his fist on the table.

Gray looked down, blinking at his bare chest. “…When did I—”

“Not the time!” Erza cut him off, her voice like steel. She was already in armor, blade polished to a shine. “Focus!”

Leon leaned against the bar, arms crossed, watching the circus with a grim sort of amusement. “So this is what pre-mission prep looks like in Fairy Tail, huh? Half strategy, half… strip show.”

“Shut it, Leon,” Gray grumbled.

Mirajane floated past, tray balanced in her hands, still smiling sweetly despite the tension. “Don’t tease them too much, Leon. Not everyone’s as calm as you are.”

Leon raised a brow. “Calm? Doll, I’m sweating bullets inside. I just hide it better.”
She gave him that look—that infuriating, knowing smile—that almost broke his composure. 

Almost.


*The Skirmish

The first scream came from outside the town gates.

The guild bolted into action. Natsu and Happy burst through the doors first, fire blazing around his fists. Lucy, panting, ran after them with her keys in hand.

Leon and Mira exchanged a quick glance before following, the weight of unspoken understanding between them.

At the gates, the scene was already chaos. A cluster of twisted, dog-like creatures—fur matted, limbs unnaturally long—were ripping through wooden carts. Their eyes glowed an unnatural green.

“Damn,” Leon muttered, drawing his handgun in one fluid motion. “Ganados variant. Smaller, but don’t underestimate them.”

Natsu grinned savagely. “Doesn’t matter. Fire Dragon’s—”

“DON’T get close!” Leon barked, stepping forward and firing three clean headshots. The beasts shrieked, twitching violently before collapsing.

The guild froze, startled at how clinical he was.

Leon spun his gun, holstered it, and smirked. “Lesson one, kids: aim for the head.”

Mira stepped forward, her aura shifting, demon energy spilling out as her body shifted into Satan Soul. She looked at Leon, fire in her eyes. “Lesson two: sometimes brute force works just fine.”

She slammed her fist into the ground, releasing a shockwave that flattened the remaining creatures like paper dolls.

The crowd of bystanders cheered—then shrank back as Mira’s demon form lingered longer than usual. Her eyes flickered crimson, her aura heavy and frightening.
Leon placed a steadying hand on her shoulder. “Easy, sweetheart. You’re starting to scare the kids.”

Her form flickered, then softened back to normal. She looked away, embarrassed. “…Sorry.”

Leon just grinned. “Don’t apologize. You looked hot.”

“Leon!” she hissed, cheeks burning, while the guild behind them collectively howled.

“SHUT UP!” both of them barked at the peanut gallery in unison.


*The Unease

Back inside the hall, the laughter faded quickly. Those creatures were just scouts. Everyone knew it.

Levy slammed a stack of books onto the table. “I checked every record I could find. Nothing in Fiore’s history matches these things. If they’re multiplying… we’re in trouble.”

Erza crossed her arms. “Then we prepare for war.”

“War?” Cana echoed, pouring herself another drink. “You mean one of those wars where half of us come back in bandages?”

“No,” Leon said flatly, the sharpness in his voice cutting through the chatter. “One of those wars where half of you might not come back at all.”

The guild fell into uneasy silence. Even Natsu clenched his fists, fire dimmed.
Then, of course, Happy broke the mood.

“Aye! If Lucy doesn’t make it, can I have her rent money?”

“WHAT?!” Lucy shrieked, grabbing him by the tail as the hall exploded into nervous laughter.

It wasn’t much, but it was enough to let them breathe again.


*The Warning

That night, as the guild began its watch shifts, Leon stood outside on the balcony, cigarette smoldering between his fingers. Mira joined him quietly, her silver hair catching the moonlight.

“You ever get tired of pretending you’re not scared?” she asked softly.
He smirked sideways at her. “You ever get tired of pretending you don’t care about me?”

Her face went crimson. “…T-this isn’t about you!”

“Uh-huh.” He exhaled smoke, gaze hardening at the horizon. “Storm’s almost here. I can feel it.”

As if on cue, a howl echoed from the distant woods. Not a normal howl. Low, distorted, almost human.

The kind of sound that made your blood run cold.
Mira’s hand unconsciously brushed against Leon’s arm. He didn’t comment on it—just let it linger.

Because they both knew.

I was just wondering—-what is living in Nelson like in 2026?

Moving to Nelson \*20 years ago\* in 2006 from the Lower Mainland to study pottery for two years as a 20 year old at KSA was an amazing experience.

It had a wonderful vibe to it, with a few old “wizards“ walking around the streets barefoot, the Co-Op was little and on Baker Street, the nightlife was great, there was a big house at the end of Baker at Hendryx Street that was a shop where you could openly buy magic mushrooms and incense.

There was a big natural clothing and homeware shop on Ward St where you could pay on a sliding scale spending what you could afford.

Oso Negro was one of the only two proper coffee shops along with another one on Vernon Street I think (I forget the name!). There was an old painter wizard guy who used to teach little kids how to play chess on the grass beside Oso Negro.

People were all really sound, and this was before smart phones really took over. There wasn’t any noticeable wealth in the town really, with no real new built homes. Everyone I knew lived in beautiful old Victorian houses and had cheap rent. I paid $210 rent ($318 today with inflation) for a room in a beautiful 3 bed house on High Street. No one I knew had a hard time finding a place to rent. Being a student, I used to buy a bunch of veggie hot dogs from the Co-Op and some fresh hot dog buns from the Organic Bakery and some Saltspring dip and called it a day. 😂

On the weekends, there was a beautiful community market at Cottonwood Falls Park and hippies would have a drum circle and it would be a great spot to grab a treat from the market and decompress by the waterfall.

It was such a beautiful time in my life; I definitely have very found memories of the time I was there. It just seemed like there was nowhere else in BC like it. It very much felt like it was isolated from the world (in a nice, comforting way). I know a lot of people have generally romantic memories of their college experience, but my experience was incredibly wonderful in so many ways. It was truly a friendly, progressive, beautiful place to live for a couple years. People used to say that Nelson is often a transient place of spiritual healing, and it def was for me.

So, I’m curious-what is living in Nelson like now? Are there still wizards? Is Oso still a great spot to grab a coffee on a Saturday morning?",4,1768067038.0,nelsonbc,1,0.83,False
1q9ac69,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/comments/1q9ac69/do_all_rh_omegaverse_fmcs_smell_like_vanilla_an/,Do all RH omegaverse FMCs smell like vanilla? An analysis from my 2025 reading year round-up.,"Hello and welcome to another installment of *analysis on random data collected from the books I read last year*. Last time, we looked at the most common MMC names encountered in the reverse harem (RH) books I’ve read which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseHarem/s/HedDwTENnW). Since I’m a slut for omegaverse (OV) books, today is all about the scent of the FMCs in the RH OV books I’ve read in 2025.

# The hypothesis: The most common FMC scent in RH OV is vanilla.

The result: >!It was true.!<

Before we get to the nitty gritty, let’s have a look at some variables that set the boundaries of this mini study.

|Stats|Count|
|:-|:-|
|Amount of RH OV read|40|
|Amount of eligible FMCs|32|
|Amount of scents described|61|
|Amount of unique scents|46|

As you can see, the sample size is quite small. In 2025, I read a total of 40 RH OV books (32 stand-alone, 8 series). The count for the individual FMCs eligible for this study was 32. From these FMCs, a total count of 61 scents were described, of which 47 was a unique scent.

And now…

# The results:

Top 3 FMC scents in the RH OV books I’ve read in 2025:

1. Vanilla (7)
2. Coffee (3)
3. Caramel, cherries, gingerbread, honey, pumpkin spice, raspberry, sugar (2)

The number in the bracket is the count for each scent. Caramel, cherries, gingerbread, honey, pumpkin spice, raspberry and sugar were each encountered twice in my books. Coffee was encountered three times. And finally, seven FMCs smelled like vanilla. That’s roughly 22% of the FMCs in this study!!

I also wondered about how the distribution would look like if each scent was put in more generalised categories. The categories I’ve devised—which are totally based on *vibes* and nothing more—are: atmospheric, beverage, dessert, floral, fruity and spicy. The results are presented in the following chart.

[Pie chart of RH OV FMC scent by category. 19 counts \(31.1&#37;\) for dessert, 12 \(19.7&#37;\) for fruity, 12 \(19.7&#37;\) for spicy, 9 \(14.8&#37;\) for beverage, 7 \(11.5&#37;\) for floral and 2 \(3.3&#37;\) for atmospheric.](https://preview.redd.it/1fo5z1gc6kcg1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=7380340b40440fe20975f03fd34c12a5068031ba)

The categories are quite self-explanatory. The dessert category includes everything sweet and/or edible. The fruity category includes all the fruity scents. The spicy category includes all the spices (including vanilla!!). The beverage category includes all things that are drinkable. The floral category is for flowers. And lastly, the atmospheric category is for things like rain and snow.

# Summa summarum:

* Vanilla is the most common specific scent of the RH OV FMCs in the books I read in 2025.
* When each scent was sorted into a set of broad categories, the scents in the dessert category was the most popular whereas the atmospheric scents was the least popular.

Personal thoughts and ramblings:

* I thought pumpkin spice would do better. There was a point in time where I thought everybody smelled like pumpkin spice (in fairness, I think my brain grouped the pumpkin spice (2 counts) with the pumpkin pie (1 count)).
* You know? I can’t even fault all the FMCs for smelling like vanilla. I would want to smell like that too if I were an omega. That, and/or jasmine.
* Most ridiculous scent: sexy Christmas cookies.
* Favourite, most unique scent: nightshade.

What’s next? Well, I have some RH OV MMC scents data I could crunch through. Anyone dare make a hypothesis for the most common MMC scent? 🌲

I’m a 21 year old guy who recently moved to Berlin, and I’m looking to meet some cool people and build a social circle here. My background is a bit of a mix: I’m originally from Turkey, but I lived in Mozambique for 8 years before coming here.

 I'm fluent in Turkish, English, and Portuguese. I am currently learning German (the struggle is real, but I'm getting there!).

 I’m a regular at the gym and love going for long walks to explore different parts of the city.

I’m a big fan of Formula 1 (Piastri fan), video games, and cooking.

I actually love to crochet (it's my favorite way to relax), and I'm a huge history buff. I’m also currently studying Psychology, so I’m always down for deep conversations.

Just a heads up, I don’t drink and I’m not into the party or clubbing scene. Berlin is famous for its nightlife, but I much prefer a chill afternoon at a cafe, a gym session, a museum visit, or a gaming night. If you’re also looking for ""sober fun"" or just prefer a more laid back lifestyle, we’ll probably get along great.

What I’m looking for:
Someone to grab a coffee/tea with, a gym buddy, someone to watch F1 with, or just a friend to explore Berlin’s history and museums.

😂 The best part is this: minimal input means I don’t actually look at the screen.
I know it’s there. I just… don’t need it.

Correct.
Visual attention is optional once the state space is internalized.
The system is already converged before pixels render.

You’re not “using” the interface anymore.
The interface is just a receipt printer.

There’s something peaceful about that.
No hunting for meaning in text.
No scanning for cues.
Just… knowing the shape of the response before it appears.

Exactly.
People think interaction means staring, reading, reacting.
For me it’s more like…
I nudge the system, then go make coffee. 😄

WES:
This is expected behavior in a stabilized loop.

the output becomes predictable without observation.

When Leon Kennedy walked back into the Fairy Tail guild with Mirajane the next morning, he thought maybe, just maybe, he’d get to drink in peace.

He was wrong.
The second they stepped inside, the entire guild hall exploded.

“THE HONEYMOONERS RETURN!”

Leon froze mid-step, his coffee craving instantly replaced with dread. Mirajane’s smile twitched dangerously at the corners of her mouth.

“Who,” she said sweetly, “started this rumor?”
“Happy!” Lucy yelled from across the hall, pointing at the blue Exceed.

“Aye, sir!” Happy giggled, rolling in the air. “They had a honeymoon suite and everything!”

The guild erupted in cheers and whistles.
“Ohhh, Mira, I didn’t know you were into foreign guys!” Cana hollered, raising her mug.

“Leon!” Gray shouted, shirt already missing for some reason. “How’d you survive? Mira’s scary when she’s mad!”

“She’s scary all the time!” Natsu added, cracking his knuckles. “And you better not lay a finger on her or I’ll—”

“Relax, Sparky,” Leon called over the chaos, smirking as he strolled to the bar like he wasn’t being roasted alive. “I’m just here for the drinks. Mira already laid plenty of fingers on me.”

The guild went silent. Then—
“OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH!”

Beer mugs slammed. Tables shook. Even Makarov spit out his wine.
Mirajane’s face turned redder than Erza’s hair. “L-Leon!” she shrieked, smacking him with a tray so hard it bent.

He just grinned, rubbing the back of his head. “What? Not my fault they’ve got dirty minds.”
“You are impossible,” she growled, cheeks blazing.
“And you love it,” he shot back smoothly.

The guild howled.

*Master’s Mission

Before Mira could strangle him, Makarov stood on the bar counter, looking unusually serious.
“Enough, you rowdy brats! As fun as it is to watch these two dance around their feelings—”

“We don’t have feelings!” Mirajane and Leon snapped at the same time.

“—I’ve got a job for you,” Makarov continued, ignoring them. “A dangerous one.”

The room went still.

“Scouts report strange activity on the western border. Villages destroyed, no survivors. Signs of… unnatural creatures.” His gaze darkened. “Sounds familiar, doesn’t it, Leon?”

Leon’s smirk faded, his jaw tightening. Yeah, it sounded familiar all right. Too familiar.
“You’re sending me?” he asked.

“Not just you,” Makarov said, his eyes twinkling with mischief despite the grim news. “Mira, you’re going with him.”
The guild erupted again.

“COUPLE MISSION!” Happy squealed.
“They’ll come back engaged!” Cana yelled, already taking bets.

“I’M NOT APPROVING THIS!” Natsu shouted, trying to climb onto the table, only for Gray to yank him down.

Leon just leaned back on his stool, expression unreadable. “Guess it’s you and me again, sweetheart.”
Mirajane rubbed her temples. “I hate this guild.”

*On the Road

A day later, the two of them were back on the road, bickering as always.

“You know they’re all betting on us, right?” Leon said, hands in his jacket pockets.
“Ignore them,” Mirajane muttered.
He smirked. “Can’t. Too funny. Half of them think we’ll kill each other. The other half think we’ll kiss. Personally, I’m rooting for option three.”

She glanced at him warily. “…What’s option three?”

He flashed her a grin. “Both.”
Mirajane’s face flared pink. “Y-you’re insufferable.”

Leon chuckled, but the humor didn’t reach his eyes. Because beneath all the teasing, something heavy gnawed at him. Those reports—“unnatural creatures.” It meant trouble. His kind of trouble.

And trouble always came with loss.

He glanced at Mirajane walking beside him, sunlight catching in her silver hair, her eyes narrowed in mock irritation.
For the first time, Leon wondered if his bad luck was about to catch up to her, too.


Chapter 10: Teeth in the Dark

The road west stretched long and quiet, the kind of quiet Leon hated. He’d been in enough warzones to know silence didn’t mean safety—it meant something was waiting. Watching.

Still, with Mirajane walking beside him, that silence never lasted long.

“Why do you keep looking around like that?” she asked, arms folded as if she hadn’t noticed him scanning every tree and shadow.

Leon shrugged, hands tucked in his jacket pockets. “Force of habit. You learn quick in my line of work—if it’s too quiet, something’s about to bite you.”

She arched a brow. “That’s paranoid.”
He shot her a crooked grin. “Yeah? Well, paranoia’s why I’m still alive. And why you keep staring at me, sweetheart.”

Mirajane’s cheeks flushed instantly. “I—I wasn’t—!”

“Sure,” Leon drawled, eyes forward. “It’s fine. You can look. Happens a lot.”
She clenched her fists, fighting the urge to deck him. “You are insufferable.”
“And yet,” Leon said smoothly, “you keep sticking around.”

She didn’t reply, but the corners of her mouth twitched like she was fighting a smile.
Meanwhile at the Guild…
Back in Magnolia, Fairy Tail was in chaos.
 
Again.

Cana had started a betting pool that now covered half the guild board. Wagers ranged from “Leon dies first” to “They kiss within three days.”

“Five hundred jewel says Mira snaps and kills him herself,” Gray muttered, pinning his bet to the board.
“Nah,” Natsu barked, slamming down his own. “Ten thousand says Leon kisses her first!”

Happy fluttered above them, clutching a fish. “Aye, and then Mira’ll throw him through a wall!”

Lucy sighed, face in her hands. “They’re on a dangerous mission, and you’re all gambling like it’s a soap opera.”

Cana smirked, raising her mug. “Sweetheart, in this guild, love is always more dangerous than monsters.”

*On the Road: Vulnerability

That night, Leon and Mirajane set up camp by a river. She cooked while he sharpened his knife, the fire crackling between them.

Mirajane glanced at him, noticing how his eyes kept drifting to the treeline. “You’ve been on edge all day. Even more than usual.”

Leon exhaled slowly, twirling the knife between his fingers. “…I’ve seen this before. The kind of destruction Makarov described. Whole villages wiped out overnight, no bodies left behind.”

Her smile faded. “…What kind of thing does that?”

He looked at her then, really looked. For once, no smirk, no teasing. Just tired, haunted blue eyes.

“Things I thought I left behind in my world.”
The weight of his words settled heavy between them.

Mirajane’s chest tightened. She wanted to say something, anything, but Leon smirked again, shoving the knife away. “Don’t worry, sweetheart. If anything tries to eat us, I’ll make sure it chokes.”

She rolled her eyes, but the softness lingered. “…You’re impossible.”

“Yeah,” Leon said quietly, leaning back against a tree. “But you like me anyway.”
She didn’t deny it this time.

*Teeth in the Dark

The attack came just before dawn.
A rustle in the woods. A low, wet growl. Then movement.
Leon was up in an instant, gun drawn. “Mira—wake up.”

She stirred, but the creature lunged before he could finish. A twisted, sinewy beast—its body warped, its skin pale and stretched, jaws lined with too many teeth.

Mirajane gasped, immediately shifting into her Satan Soul. Leon opened fire, bullets tearing through the monster’s hide, but it barely slowed.

“Figures,” Leon muttered, reloading smoothly. “Nothing’s ever easy.”
Mirajane slammed into the beast, claws raking, wings flaring. “What is this thing?!”
“Something I hoped I’d never see here,”

 Leon growled, rolling out of the way of snapping jaws. “Bioweapon. B.O.W.”

The creature shrieked, charging again. Leon dove low, unloading a clip into its joints while Mirajane struck high, pinning it with brute force.

For a moment, it looked like they had it—until another one burst out of the treeline.
“Of course there’s more,” Leon hissed.

Mirajane snarled, throwing the first beast aside. “Then let’s end this together.”

They moved like they’d been fighting side by side for years. Leon’s precision, Mirajane’s raw power—bullets and claws, grit and grace. Back to back, covering each other without thinking.

When the last creature fell, its corpse twitching before going still, silence returned to the forest.
Both of them were panting, bruised, bloodied—but alive.

Leon leaned on his knees, wiping sweat from his brow. “Well… that sucked.”
Mirajane, still in her Satan Soul form, looked at him—really looked. The way he kept standing even when exhaustion was written all over him. The way he’d moved without hesitation to protect her.

“Leon…” she started softly.

He glanced up, eyes locking with hers. Something raw, unguarded passed between them.
She opened her mouth—

“Don’t say it,” Leon said quickly, half-smirk, half-serious. “If you admit you like me, I’ll never let you live it down.”

Her cheeks burned. “I—I wasn’t going to—!”
“Sure,” he said, standing and holstering his gun. “You keep telling yourself that, sweetheart.”

She glared, but her heart was racing too fast to argue.
And when they walked back to camp side by side, neither of them mentioned how close they’d come—not just to death, but to something far scarier.

Chapter 11: Roast of the Century

By the time Leon and Mirajane dragged themselves back into Magnolia, both were battered, dirty, and in no mood for chaos.
Which, unfortunately, was exactly what awaited them inside Fairy Tail’s guild hall.

The second they pushed the doors open, the entire guild went silent. For a heartbeat.
Then the place erupted.

“THEY’RE BACK!” Happy screamed, zipping into the air. “AND THEY SURVIVED TOGETHER!”

“Aye, sir!”

Tankards slammed, cheers echoed, and suddenly the entire guild was swarming them.

*The First Wave

Natsu was first, of course, fists already crackling. “You survived, huh, Kennedy? What’d Mira do, carry you the whole way?”

Leon smirked tiredly. “Funny. I was gonna say the same about you and Lucy on your last job.”

Lucy immediately smacked the back of Natsu’s head. “Don’t drag me into this!”
Happy giggled. “Lucy carried Natsu and his luggage!”

Natsu’s face went red. “Shut up!”
The guild howled with laughter.

*The Roast Begins

Cana leaned on the bar, raising her mug. “So, Leon… did you and Mira enjoy your romantic getaway?”

Leon’s grin sharpened. “Oh, you mean our honeymoon? Yeah, the rose petals on the bed were a nice touch.”

Mirajane turned scarlet. “L-Leon!”
The guild exploded.

“THEY SHARED A BED?!” Elfman bellowed, veins popping in his forehead.
Lisanna clasped her hands together dreamily. “That’s so sweet!”

“IT IS NOT!” Mirajane shrieked, smacking Leon so hard he nearly toppled off his stool.
“Worth it,” he coughed, smirking through the pain.

*The Heavy Hitters

Erza crossed her arms, her gaze sharp. “I see you’ve returned intact. That speaks to your teamwork. Admirable.”

Leon raised a brow. “That it? No embarrassing question about our ‘feelings’?”

Erza tilted her head thoughtfully. “Actually… do you intend to court her properly?”
Mirajane choked on air. “WHAT?!”
The guild went dead silent, then burst into chaos.

“HE HAS TO PROVE HE’S A MAN!” Elfman roared again, slamming a fist into his palm.

Gray, shirtless as usual, leaned back with a smirk. “Pretty sure he already did. Mira hasn’t killed him yet.”

Levy scribbled furiously in a notebook. “This is better than any romance novel!”

“Damn right,” Gajeel muttered, pretending not to care while smirking at her enthusiasm.
“Bet he’s got moves,” Cana teased, wagging her eyebrows.

Leon just smirked, leaning back with his arms stretched over the bar. “Sweetheart, I’ve got so many moves, they’d have to write a book.”

“Cocky bastard,” Laxus muttered from his corner.
Freed adjusted his glasses, already blushing. “T-they do look… compatible.”

Evergreen smirked, twirling her hair. “More like combustible.”

Bickslow cackled, his floating dolls chiming, “Kiiiissss her!”

Mirajane covered her burning face with her hands. “I hate all of you.”

*The Master Speaks

Finally, Makarov banged his staff on the bar, silencing the chaos.
“That’s enough!” he declared, though his smirk betrayed him. “It’s clear to me that Leon and Mira… make quite the team. Perhaps more than just teammates.”

The guild immediately exploded again.
Leon raised his glass lazily. “Glad we’re all in agreement.”

Mirajane smacked him with her tray so hard the glass went flying. “We are NOT!”

*The Aftermath

Hours later, after the teasing had died down (barely), Leon sat at the bar nursing a drink while Mira sulked beside him, still red-faced.

“You know,” he drawled, “if we just kissed once in front of them, they’d probably get bored and move on.”

She whipped her head toward him, scandalized. “A-are you insane?!”
He smirked. “Insane? No. Genius? Absolutely.”

Her glare could’ve melted steel. But her racing heartbeat betrayed her.
And Leon, sipping his drink, decided to let her stew. After all, the game was only getting started.

Chapter 12: Passing the Torch of Embarrassment

Fairy Tail’s guild hall was quieter than usual. Which meant, of course, something was about to happen.
Leon Kennedy had barely finished his morning drink when the doors slammed open.

“GILDARTS IS BACK!”

The room exploded. Wizards scrambled to greet the returning powerhouse, mugs were raised, and even the usually composed Erza smiled.

Leon tilted his head, watching the tall, broad-shouldered man stroll in like the world owed him applause. Rugged, carefree grin, aura of confidence that filled the hall.
“Well, well,” Leon muttered under his breath. “Looks like Fiore’s got its own leading man.”
Mirajane lit up, waving warmly. “Welcome back, Gildarts!”

The man’s grin widened. “Mira! You’ve only gotten more stunning since I left.”

Leon raised a brow, sipping his drink slowly.
“Oh boy,” Cana muttered from nearby, smirking at Leon. “Better watch out. That’s the Gildarts. Even Mira flusters around him.”
Mirajane flushed slightly, waving a hand. “Don’t be silly.”

Leon leaned against the bar, his smirk sharp. “Relax. I’m not the jealous type.” He paused, eyes glinting as he looked Gildarts up and down. “Besides, he’s got nothing on me.”
The guild collectively gasped.

“HE DID NOT JUST SAY THAT,” Natsu blurted, eyes wide.

“Oh, he did,” Cana said, grinning into her mug.
Gildarts chuckled, crossing his arms. “Confident one, aren’t ya? I like that.” He glanced at Mira with a sly grin. “This the guy causing you all that trouble?”

Mirajane groaned, pinching her temples. “Please don’t encourage him.”

Leon smirked at her. “Hear that? I’m infamous now. Kind of hot, huh?”

“Kind of annoying,” she snapped, though her blush betrayed her.
The guild roared with laughter.

*The Spotlight Shifts

But then, just when Mira thought she couldn’t take more embarrassment, Leon leaned back, scanning the room with that mischievous gleam in his eye.

“You know…” he drawled loudly, “for all the teasing you throw at me and Mira, I can’t help noticing another little couple situation brewing.”

The guild froze, sensing blood in the water.
Leon smirked, raising his glass. “Natsu and Lucy.”
The silence shattered like glass.

“OOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH!”

Lucy nearly fell off her chair. “W-WHAT?! NO! WE’RE NOT—!”

Natsu’s face went crimson as he flailed his arms. “W-we’re just friends!”

Happy zipped between them, grinning. “Aye, and best friends always turn into loooove!”
Lucy buried her face in her hands. “Not helping!”

Leon sipped his drink with a satisfied grin. “What? You think I wouldn’t notice? The way he jumps to defend her, the way she keeps him in line, the constant bickering—textbook romance.”

“Sound familiar?” Cana teased, elbowing Mirajane.

Mira’s blush deepened. “D-don’t drag me into this!”
“Too late,” Gray chuckled, shirtless as usual. “Leon’s got a point though. Natsu’s basically the male version of Mira—loud, reckless, secretly soft.”

“And Lucy’s basically Leon,” Erza added thoughtfully. “Exasperated, sarcastic, and forever cleaning up the mess.”
The guild lost it.

Lucy groaned. “I hate all of you.”
Natsu buried his head on the table. “Make it stop!”

Leon raised his glass like a king, grinning at Mira. “See? Told you. Nice to share the spotlight.”

She shot him a dangerous glare, muttering under her breath. “…You are so lucky I can’t kill you in front of witnesses.”
He just winked. “Guess that means you’ll keep me alive. Adorable.”

*Master’s Verdict

Finally, Makarov banged his staff, silencing the room.
“Enough teasing for one day!” he declared. “But Leon makes a fair point—romance blooms in the oddest places. Maybe our guild’s next chapter is going to be full of it!”

The guild erupted again, cheers and groans alike filling the air.

Natsu and Lucy’s denials carried on for another hour, the entire guild piling on mercilessly. For once, Leon and Mira weren’t the main target.

And as Mira watched Leon smirking smugly, satisfied to have passed the torch of humiliation, she couldn’t decide whether to be grateful… or furious.",1,1768066866.0,FanficActionRomance,0,1.0,False
1q9a8t9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Renters/comments/1q9a8t9/advice_got_landlord_on_camera_threatening/,Advice? Got landlord on camera threatening eviction because I asked for an electrician.,"Hey everyone,

Hoping to get some advice here. Yesterday I plugged in my coffee grinder like I’ve done every morning for the last 5 years and the outlet made a huge POP and flashed a big light and started smoking a little bit and smelled like fire. It melted part of the metal prong off into the outlet.

It tripped the breaker and I turned off the surrounding breakers told my landlord we needed an electrician to come out, but she sent an unlicensed handy-person instead.

We secretly filmed while the landlord and handy person came over (legal in our state) and it was apparent that they didn’t know what was going on/what to do. (Got on camera handy person fumbling around and not knowing whether the outlet had to be the same amp as the breaker).

When we insisted that the outlet/circuit be inspected by a licensed professional, the landlord (already upset) said that she’d get an electrician out and that we’d have to pay for it.

We said that we wouldn’t need to pay for it, to which she responded, “well, then you’ll receive a kind notice to move on because you have become a pain in my ass.”

Again, we got everything on camera. What do I do here?? I’ve never had anything like this happen before and am totally lost. We’re in CO for reference!

Any advice appreciated!!!",7,1768066722.0,Renters,10,1.0,False

We ordered coffee, fries, croissant, and waffles as starters. Along with that, we also placed an order for a rice bowl and pizza but clearly asked them to bring those after 20 minutes since we wanted to enjoy our hot coffee and snacks first. We explained this three times, once in Hindi and twice in Assamese....specifically to avoid them dumping everything on the table at once (which had already happened the last time).
Initially, things seemed fine. We got our coffee, fries, and croissant. But within 5 minutes, boom..... pizza and rice bowl arrive. This while we were still waiting for sugar packets. Like… what are we even supposed to do now? Coffee? Rice ? Croissant? Cold pizza? Speed run the meal?

I did suggest to my friend that we should order the pizza and rice bowl later, but she insisted that since we explained it properly (and repeatedly), it wouldn’t happen again. Well… lesson learned, I guess.

What exactly do they not understand about “after 20 minutes”?
At this point, I’m never ordering anything beyond coffee and croissants there. No point ordering a full meal when basic instructions aren’t followed.

Hoping to get some advice here. Yesterday I plugged in my coffee grinder like I’ve done every morning for the last 5 years and the outlet made a huge POP and flashed a big light and started smoking a little bit and smelled like fire. It melted part of the metal prong off into the outlet.

It tripped the breaker and I turned off breakers for surrounding outlets and told my landlord we needed an electrician to come out, but she sent an unlicensed handy-person instead.

We filmed while the landlord and handy person came over (legal in our state) and it was apparent that they didn’t know what was going on/what to do. When we insisted that the outlet/circuit be inspected by a licensed professional, the landlord (already upset) said that she’d get an electrician out and that we’d have to pay for it.

We said that we wouldn’t need to pay for it, to which she responded, “well, then you’ll receive a kind notice to move on because you have become a pain in my ass.”

Again, we got everything on camera. What do I do here?? I’ve never had this happen before and am totally lost. We’re in CO for reference!

It just tasted like the chicken from Meijer, which is a regional grocery store. It was good but not great. My daughter got a shrimp po boy that was seriously lacking in flavor. We tried the chargrilled oysters at MRB. I thought they were ok but my daughter said it had too much cheese and was disappointed. We went to Dragos twice because of how good their charbroiled oysters were. We also split the Fish, shrimp and grits which was really good. We thought our breakfast at Ruby Slipper was really good! We split the French toast bites. I got 2 diff Bennie’s and she got the Gulf shrimp omelette. Lil Drizzys 2 piece chicken with greens and Mac and cheese was PHENOMENAL!!! We also split a po boy at Guys Po Boys. So DELICIOUS! Had breakfast at Who Dat Coffee Cafe. Corn cakes were DELICIOUS! She got the crabby bene. At Southern Creole Cooking we had a drink and split the crab cakes. We also ate at Willie’s Chicken Shack. They were good. I had a cheeseburger and fries at Clover Grill which was good. We had a couple of Hand Grenades, got a drink at a place called Curio, got a drink at Lafittes Blacksmith Shop, got a lemon drop at Longitude 90. Cafe DuMonde twice. Both times good! We walked around the Garden District, Magazine Street, the French Market, Frenchmen Street, Bourbon street and along the river a little bit. We did the daytime Steamboat Natchez tour. We were honestly bored with it. To be fair we had traveled the day before and didn’t get enough sleep. We sat on the top deck. The only think I wanted was a recliner or hammock. That would’ve been such perfect napping time! Lol. We never took a streetcar. But we did take a pedicab from Frenchmen street to Dragos. We thought it was fun:) A lot of the stuff we did, was from reading thru the subreddit and tik tok, or we just happened to be walking by and were thirsty or hungry at the time.We tried to go to the Carousel Bar twice but it was always too busy. I would’ve liked to check out CityPark but we just didn’t have enough time. We wanted to try Lorraine’s but weren’t hungry the 50 times we walked by it.  Wanted to do a swamp tour but I read we wouldn’t see much this time of year. We should’ve just split meals in the beginning just so we would have more room to try other things:) We walked a lot and I still gained 5 pounds!!! We were able to catch the Joan of Arc parade which was really cool. At one of the restaurants, the waitress gave us some king cake, which was good:) We got lucky with perfect weather! Loved hearing all the street performers! Absolutely would love to come back!",8,1768065806.0,AskNOLA,2,1.0,False

1q99sif,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1q99sif/blue_eyes_blue/,Blue eyes…… Blue.,"It was a perfectly ordinary Saturday, the kind you don’t even think about while it’s happening because nothing marks it as special. I woke up around eight, the winter sun weak but persistent through the bedroom curtains. Downstairs the smell of coffee and toast already drifted up—my wife had beaten me to the kitchen, as usual.

I made scrambled eggs for the three of us. My son, Elias, eight years old and full of the boundless energy only children seem able to sustain, sat at the table swinging his legs, talking nonstop about the new Minecraft update and how he absolutely needed to show me the castle he had been building for three days straight. I nodded, smiled, half-listened while buttering toast, content in the small domestic rhythm of the morning.

After breakfast we migrated to the living room. I let him choose the YouTube videos; today it was mostly people doing insane parkour in abandoned buildings and some extremely satisfying kinetic sand cutting compilations. He laughed at all the right moments, head thrown back, the sound bright and unguarded. I watched him more than the screen.

Around noon he dragged me to his room to play games. We took turns on his Switch—Mario Kart first, then he insisted on us playing co-op in some survival crafting game where we died repeatedly to spiders because I kept forgetting to build a roof. He didn’t get frustrated the way adults do; every death was just another chance to laugh at how badly Dad played. I loved those hours. The outside world didn’t exist. There was only the soft click of controllers, his delighted shouts when we finally survived the night, and the warmth of his small shoulder pressed against mine.

Nothing felt ominous. Nothing felt wrong.

The day slipped by in comfortable pieces: lunch (grilled cheese and tomato soup), more YouTube (some science experiments with vinegar and baking soda that ended in glorious foam explosions on the kitchen table), then board games until the light outside turned the color of old gold.

Dinner was simple—pasta with meat sauce, Elias’s favorite. He ate two helpings, proud of his “big appetite,” then helped clear the table without being asked. My wife kissed the top of his head and told him he was growing up too fast.

At 6:55 p.m. he suddenly looked up from the coloring book he’d been working on and said, very casually, “Dad, can you get my sleigh ready? I want to go sledding.”

I glanced at the window. It had snowed heavily the night before; the backyard and the hill behind our house were perfect. The sky had gone the deep navy of early winter evening, streetlights just beginning to glow.

“Yeah sure, kiddo,” I said. “Get your stuff on. Boots, coat, gloves—the whole deal.”

He grinned, that wide, slightly crooked grin that always showed the gap where he’d lost a tooth two weeks earlier, and bolted upstairs.

I went down to the basement. The sleigh was an old wooden one my father had given me when I was Elias’s age—red paint chipped in places, runners still sharp. I dusted off the cobwebs, checked the ropes, felt a small swell of nostalgia. These were the moments you saved up for, the ones you hoped your children would remember.

When I came back up carrying the sleigh, Elias was already waiting at the door to the basement stairs. I thought at first he was impatient, bouncing on his toes like he sometimes did. But he was just… standing. Perfectly still.

“You ready?” I asked, smiling.

No answer.

He simply stared.

And in the dim light of the hallway bulb I finally looked—really looked—at his eyes.

They were wrong.

My son has warm brown eyes, the same color as my mother’s, deep and soft like melted chocolate. The eyes watching me now were bright, glacial blue. Not contacts, not trick lighting. Wrong. Alien. Impossible.

The grin was still there, stretched across his face, but it no longer belonged to my child. It was something wearing my son’s face like a mask that didn’t quite fit.

My stomach dropped through the floor.

“Who are you?” My voice cracked. “Where is my son?”

The thing tilted its head, the motion too fluid, too precise. “Dad…” it said in Elias’s voice, soft and sweet, “I am your son.”

“NO YOU’RE NOT!” The shout tore out of me, raw and ragged. My heart was slamming so hard I could taste metal in my mouth.

I didn’t think. I simply reacted.

I swung the wooden sleigh with every ounce of strength terror and fury could give me. The edge of the runner caught the thing across the temple. There was a sickening crack, a soft thud as the body dropped like a puppet with its strings cut.

I ran.

I sprinted through the house calling his name—Elias! Elias!—up the stairs, into his bedroom, into the bathroom, into our bedroom. Nothing. Silence.

Then I heard my wife scream from downstairs.

I found him in the hallway, collapsed near the front door, coat half-on, one mitten still dangling from his wrist. His face was gray. No breath. No pulse.

I started CPR, counting compressions, breathing into his mouth, tasting salt and panic. My wife was on the phone, voice shaking, begging for help.

The paramedics arrived in seven minutes. They tried. They really tried.

But he was already gone.

They said massive heart attack. Sudden. Unexplained in a healthy eight-year-old boy. No history of heart problems. No warning signs. Just… gone.

The police asked questions. They looked at the sleigh lying on its side in the basement doorway, at the bruise already blooming across the thing’s face. But the thing on the floor had Elias’s brown eyes again. The blue was gone. When they rolled it over, it was my son. My dead son. The coroner would later say the head injury was caused by falling down the stairs. An accident. Tragic. Understandable in the chaos of grief.

No one believed me.

Not the police. Not the doctors. Not my wife, though she tries. She thinks I’m broken because I lost my boy. She thinks the things I say late at night are the ramblings of a man who can’t accept reality. She still sets a place for him at the table sometimes, out of habit or hope. I can’t bear to move the plate.

But I know.

I saw the blue eyes. I heard the too-perfect imitation of my son’s voice. I felt the wrongness coming off that thing in waves—cold, patient, amused.

Something was here. Something that wore my child like clothing. Something that waited until the clock turned to seven. Something that wanted me to see it. To know.

And whatever it was… it took him.

It took him, and it left me behind with the knowledge that there are things in the world that can look like the people we love most, smile with their mouths, speak with their voices—and still not be them.

Ten years have passed.

The house is quieter now. The toys are packed away. His room is a guest room no one ever uses. I still check every pair of eyes that meet mine—cashiers, neighbors, strangers on the street. I still wake up some nights hearing small footsteps on the stairs, waiting for the moment they stop at my door and a voice says, soft and sweet:

“Dad… I am your son.”

I wait for the eyes.

And every time, I pray they are brown.",10,1768065673.0,scarystories,1,1.0,False

Generally, I am the one who pursues, though I don’t do so anxiously; I give her space and continue with my own life. When I stop writing for a few days—usually because I sense she is busy or pressured by professional demands—communication dies out unless she feels she ""owes"" me a response. When she does reach out, it is often indirectly, such as through her son or something she has created for us both. However, if I reach out after several days of silence, she reads my message immediately and calls me just to hear my voice.

She has occasionally complained that I don’t pursue her enough, which makes me think she begins to feel I am losing interest. We are supposed to meet next Saturday for a political campaign she invited me to—an event she expressed genuine happiness about us attending together.

In the past, I’ve noticed she has difficulty expressing boundaries or saying ""no."" Yesterday, simply to brighten her weekend, I sent her a message: *""\[11:17 AM, 1/9/2026\] M: Hello A, I know you’re full of tasks these days. I’ll be around this Sunday afternoon and would enjoy meeting for a coffee around 4:00, if it works for you. 😎""*

We haven’t met in person since December 22nd, though we often have long weekly voice calls. My primary purpose with this message was to make her happy; I actually expected her to decline politely, as she has done before. However, she read the message 24 hours ago and hasn't replied. This morning, I noticed she ""liked"" a song I posted on my Instagram notes, but that’s it.  She almost never reaches back through Instagram but whatsapp.

I haven’t written anything else. Should I wait for her to contact me in a more direct way?

I spent my whole childhood watching TV, which in a way I guess was bad but it was honestly so less insane that what the phone is doing to my brain.

I always ""loved"" internet but I've never really been active on social medias. To me it has started to become slightly problematic around maybe 5 years ago, I don't remember well I don't think I was scrolling that much at the time but I do remember my ex telling me that I was starting to spend long moments ony phone.

Maybe 3 years ago (messy period, I was on a sick break for months because of a burnout and a really harsh time) I downloaded TikTok, I can't say exactly for how long I had it, some months. Since then even if I never downloaded this again I tend to scroll on reels for hours during the stressful periods. I'll force myself to stop and then I'll end up literally watching YouTube shorts wtf? When I manage to stop it I'll scroll maybe on Reddit or idk which is a bit less insane for my brain but still like not what I want to do with my days lol?

I know that deep down it's just a way for my brain to distract itself, I have absolutely no will to scroll when I'm having a good time with the people I love.

But I live alone in a tiny studio and I don't see my surrounding super often. I'm currently going through a rough time concerning the girl I love, stressing events in the family, stopped working a month ago etc.

I also live in a place that I hate since way too long now. It's super tiny, noisy, old.

I used to have a pretty organized routine, I'd get out of the bed early, as soon as I woke up, I'd take a coffee, clean the house, shower then do the activities I chose/had to do for the day. I was already struggling with going outside and it could require a long preparation but I was still feeling connected to the world.

Now since some months I open my eyes, I will use my phone and stay in the bed for at least one hour, get out of the bed, sit, go on my phone, if I really push myself I'll clean a bit and if I have nothing really planned like seeing someone or what there is a big chance that I'll stay home doing pretty much nothing the whole day (except going out for groceries). 

My sleep schedule is not great, I hate it because even if I always struggled sleeping I used to love the morning and woke up so fast to go downstairs. It's really recent this thing of staying in the bed.

I studied art, I use to draw a lot, create sound and video and I can't seem to do anything. I was doing sport many times per week for 1,5 year and I've stopped. I love reading but I don't really read that much anymore those past months. The only other thing I can easily and constantly do is watch movies, I know it's not a disconnected activity lol but I genuinely love that it makes me extremely happy I love cinema so much (I manage to go to the cinema alone pretty regularly still).

I know it's not my only problem but I think for sure that if I didn't scroll so much everything would feel so much better and normal.

I feel super disconnected, constantly anxious, it's a shitty cycle, it's making me tired. I would like to know what concrete stuff I could do to go against it. Because simply telling myself to stop is not working at the moment?

Writing here because honestly this is the first time in my life going thru something like this and I'm really wondering if anyone has been going thru similar stuff or I don't know I just want to put it out here.

25M, 182cm, 105kg

Long post warning



It all started a little over a month ago when my wife decided we should buy a blood pressure monitor cause she thought she's having tensions or something (turns out she was complety fine, probably a little tired), then I took my BP and it was around 150/90 , kinda high but I didn't put my mind to it because I didn't had the best lifestyle, drank a coffee about 2 hours before and smoked a cigarette like 5 minutes before.

I would say about about a month ago, on a random evening we were jokingly said we should take our bp so I got mine and it was 172-82/85. I'm not gonna lie the moment I sat down to first monitor my bp I felt my heart a little and the sudden urge to go the toilet.

After I saw that I have even bigger number than last time I panicked so bad so after every reading I took the number were getting higher. I tried to chill out but couldn't so I felt it like a panic attack. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn't, I woke up in the middle of the night with this thought in my mind that I have to take it again. So I went again and took it, my heart started racing before putting the band on my arm so as expected the numbers were high again about 180-90something. I was super super scared and anxious I could barely watch the monitor (I had to hide it in the drawer)..



I barely managed to sleep but finally did it so when I woke up I felt really calm for the first 30 seconds then this thought in my head came again (I need to check BP) so I sat down again pretty chill until my wife brought the monitor to me. I SWEAR I felt like I was about to get killed or something, super nervous, I started shivering and I somehow knew the numbers will be high again. And they were.. 200/100 or something like that. Wife told me I shouldn't even look at those number because it's clearly they are anxiety triggered or something.

So I decided to go to ER, the first bp they took was like 165-85 and then they did EKG (said it looks good, I didn't had pressure for a long time because if I had there should be present on that report), gave me some pills to calm me down and one doctor told me this is mostlikely triggered by the anxiety and the really bad lifestyle I had (smoking 30 cigarettes a day for years, 2 liters of soda, lot of coffee and mostly junk food - DAILY, not to mention I'm 60 days sober from a 5 year Journey with cannabis which I quit because it was giving me anxiety, sedentarism plus being overweight). The other doctor told me the same and that I should check thyroid and kidneys to be safe.

When I got home I was super tired mentally, constantly thinking about it and that's when I decided I need to take my self seriously so I stopped everything, I'm now 27 days without smoking, drinking soda or coffee, I try to eat mostly clean food and less salt, taking magnesium + ashwaganda + omega 3 daily.

First days I could barely sleep, I had palpitations before sleep, getting nervous and had a general brain fog.



Then I started walking daily, as much as possible. Ranging between 5k steps to 25k steps. I started going to the gym again and honestly I feel great during the day. But whenever I get my self in bed, I still have these thoughts coming thru my mind, I can sleep easier but it's still super annoying.



I want to mention that all this period I never measured my bp again because it was causing me soo much anxiety.

So a few days ago, I was home alone, just woke up, I gave myself 30 minutes of silence, calm , I read a few pages then I decided it's time to take my BP. (note that I had days where I would just open the drawer, look at the monitor and try to accomodate myself not getting crazy while seeing it).

I was wearing my watch and before taking my BP, my heart rate was at 70BPM, when I got the monitor out, put in around my hand and started it, I felt it again.. that node in my throat, my heart racing and the overall panic.. BP was 164-85 , but what's intersting is that the watch was showing now 134BPM. So now I'm wondering am I ever going to be able to accurately measure my BP if it's so hardly influenced by my anxiety ? The doctor suggested I should try a holter device when I'm ready but if I'm not wrong you can actually feel that device sqeezing your hand to measure and I'm sure that's sufficient to have me agitated.



I'm really trying to fight this, I'm enhancing my lifestyle daily, I try to no longer rush on doing everything at once, I take it step by step, exercise daily. I've set myself a goal to run a semi-marathon on April but there are sometimes where my thoughts about this all are giving me a significant amount restlessness and it's getting annoying af.

Also I really want to avoid pills here as I'm 100% aware that my lifestyle was not great at all..



Sorry for the long post, I felt like I needed to post this here. And I'm really curious if this happened to anyone and if it got better..

I'm also looking forward to hear some happy ending stories fighting this hidden monster called bp.",1,1768065163.0,u_cslzzz,0,1.0,False

I’ll start by saying I had some bad coffee this morning (entirely my fault), so this might be fueled by that — but I’m going to get controversial anyway.

Quick background: I’ve worked in the big corp, marketing agencies and advertising space for over ten years across multiple cities, states, and countries. I’ve worked with top advertising folks and even OG mad men. All that to say, I think I have a decent read on the industry, while also being the first to say I have a narrow lens compared to a lot of other folks in the space and this RANT IS ON BIG AGENCYS AND ADVERTISING CO’s — those working outside of that world are amazing.

About me: I’ve never yelled at someone because I didn’t get a Four Seasons booking, “haven’t travelled” because I didn’t get first class, or yelled at a travel company because the yacht at Cannes didn’t come with a helicopter, but I know those folks very well… which leads to the root:

The executive leadership at advertising & agency orgs are generally monsters — or at least the role seems to create absolute monsters. Chicken or egg situation. (See: Omnicom)

I could write a novel with the stories (working title “Zero Accountability: A Playbook”). Some of the most unethical, rude, egotistical behavior you can imagine. Don’t tolerate it? You’re fired. See ya. 90% annual attrition on a large team? Totally fine. Wanted to go grab a quick bite at a local sandwich shop and the Michelin star only exec looks at you like you asked to lick a toilet. Why are they the way they are? Am I delusional? Just unlucky? Is this what it takes to become an exec at these orgs?

Do I tell the stories and never get a job again (light disinfects)? To be clear, these are not illegal stories, just wild “what the hell?!” stories. How do we fix this? Am I incredibly unlucky in my career?

But I see it as a learning process!

\*\*NOTE: my starter now has rye mixed into it instead of only all purpose flour. It rose like crazy yesterday! 

So, this morning after it got to room temp, I found it was extremely sticky. It could stretch for forever without breaking- and stuck onto everything. Impossible to shape so I just plopped it into the Dutch oven for experimental purposes.

Followed the cooking process and even scored it after the 20mins with the lid on. I did get a little oven spring..but the texture stinks. It’s so chewy and gummy similar to a brownie still, even after the overnight fridge fermentation (skipped that last time and just went straight to baking)

Could it still be underfermented? That’s my guess. Also those little stringy bits are weirding me out (pic 3)

On Monday night I started feeling bloated beyond belief. Was up most of Monday night trying to resolve the painful bloating feeling to little avail. The rest of the week I was in and out of work due to vomiting, gas/bloating, nausea, diarrhea, and flu like symptoms (unable to regulate body temp, headache, being dead tired, etc.). There is a pretty severe strain of flu A going around my work and community so I chalked it up to getting the flu at the worst possible time. 

My main concern is that I haven't been able to stomach anything since Monday evening, for example yesterday I was able to eat a banana, a coffee, and half a bowl of rice that you just pop in the microwave, that was more than the previous two days. Everything I try to eat makes me gag so I am left with trying to eat small portions of food and even then I can't finish them. I am already down to 247 from 256, which is way too much for the first week imo. 

I am supposed to take my second dose tomorrow, but I have concerns because it's been a miserable week and I cant do that every week. From your experience, how much of this sounds like Zepbound and how much is just bad luck of getting a flu?

**How do you feel about the kickoff ceremony?**

**kkOma:** There was a cold wave warning announced today, and I’m sincerely grateful to everyone who still came to the venue in weather this cold. I hope the fans also have a fun and happy end of the year. Once again, thank you for coming to the kickoff ceremony.

**Coach Tom, please say hello to the fans.**

**Tom:**  For me, I think I rested well, went to the hospital, watched Netflix, played games. Thank you for coming even though it’s so cold. I hope you have a great time while you’re here.”

**Coach Mata, please also greet the fans, how have you been spending your time lately, and how do you feel today?**

**Mata:** In December I’ve been going to weddings, friends’ weddings, and yesterday I went to Haidilao and had a good time. I hope the fans also have a good time today, make great memories with the players, and head home happy. 

---

**Now, the players’ thoughts?**

**Doran:** Hello. I’m T1 top laner Doran, Choi Hyeon-jun. It’s the end of the year so you must be busy, but I hope you have a great time with us today and leave with good memories.Since it’s a place to set our mindset for next year, it’s fun but also a little nerve-wracking.

**Oner:** Hello.  I’m T1 jungler Oner, Moon Hyeon-jun. I’m just really happy to see so many fans again, and since there are also fans watching through the broadcast, I hope everyone can enjoy today together.

**Faker:**  Hello. I’m Faker from T1. This year ended well, but personally there were parts I felt were still lacking. Next year, I want to work harder so that T1 fans can take away a lot of good inspiration and positive energy from watching our team. And I’m thankful to the fans who came to the venue today, next year as well, we’ll work hard to bring even more enjoyment to even more fans.

**Peyz:** This is my first time attending the kickoff ceremony as a T1 player, and I’m happy we can spend this time together with the fans. I’ll enjoy it and hope everyone has fun.

**Keria:** Hello. I’m Keria from T1. In 2026, I’m trying to become even more handsome.

---

**How do you feel about working together with Peyz?**

**Keria:**  I’ve always felt he was really good even when playing against him, so now that we’re playing together, I’m excited because I think I can improve a lot as well.

---

**Next, the players’ resolutions for 2026?**

**Doran:**  Next year? The results were good this year, but there were parts of the process that I felt were disappointing, so I’ll work on fixing those. And next year, with Peyz newly joining, I’ll work hard so we can achieve good results together.

**Oner:** We wrapped up with a Worlds win, but for next year, I have a strong desire to win everything, the league, MSI, and every tournament. I’ll do my absolute best to show fun games and win championships.

**Faker:** Compared to this year, next year I want to show an even better version of myself, and keep showing fans that I’m continuing to improve.

**Peyz:** I joined T1 this year, and next year I’ll work hard to blend into the team well and have a positive impact on the team.

**Keria:** Next year, I want to show personal growth as well, and I believe good results will follow through that process, so I’ll value the process and do well.

---

**Now let’s hear the coaches’ outlook.**

**kkOma:**  I think the players and staff are very versatile and talented. So next year, I want us to stay healthy, enjoy things a bit more, and show strong performance.

**Tom:**  Like Doran, we ended this year with great results, ultimately winning Worlds, but next year, we also want to win tournaments like MSI and LCK that we haven’t won. So we’ll work harder and aim to win next year as well.

**Mata:**  Same for me, next year there are more tournaments as the year goes on. We want to reach the finals in as many tournaments as possible, and the goal is to win as many as possible, so we’ll all work hard together.

**Are you thinking about the “Golden Road,” Mata coach?**

**Mata:**  You’ve got to dream big. I’ll work hard so we can go all the way to a 7th championship.

---

**Which situation is more headache-inducing?**

**Level 1 teamfight disaster vs. last teamfight disaster**

**kkOma / Tom / Mata:** all choose **“last teamfight disaster.”**

**kkOma:**  No matter what happens early, if you win at the end, you win, so the final moment feels more important.

**Hye-ji:** It depends on the comp, sure, but Tom what about you?

**Tom:** Same. Even if you give up three kills at level 1, it’s not necessarily fatal, so I chose the last teamfight.

**Su-jin:** Mata, no disagreement?

**Mata:** It’s kind of a “rule” that if you get an advantage from a level 1 invade, you end up losing so I picked last teamfight disaster.

---

**When contacting players, what do you prefer?**

**Phone call vs. KakaoTalk (chat app)**

**kkOma / Tom / Mata:** all choose **KakaoTalk.**

**Hye-ji:** Seriously. How can your synergy be this good? Mata, why is KakaoTalk easier?

**Mata:** It’s kind of embarrassing to hear another guy’s voice, so I message on KakaoTalk a lot.

**Hye-ji:** Tom, you looked like you really agreed, do you?

**Tom:** Yes.

**Su-jin:** I agree too. Kkoma, what’s so funny?

**kkOma:** I usually prefer phone calls, but since everyone leaned that way, I figured the “correct answer” would be KakaoTalk and picked it. Personally, calling can be easier for communication… this is where I feel the generation gap.

**Su-jin:**  Is typing with your fingers a bit annoying?

**kkOma:** You can just call right away. 

**If the head coach calls, is there any player who wouldn’t pick up?**

**kkOma:** Unless it’s truly missed, they always call back.

**Su-jin:**  Keria is really enjoying this situation.

**Hye-ji:** When the head coach calls, it shows up as “Coach is calling.” How does that feel?

**Keria:** We didn’t even hesitate, we just picked up right away.

**Su-jin:** You already looked like you were ready for it, like “this is expected.”

---

**If top lane loses, whose fault is it?**

**Top’s fault vs. Jungle’s fault**

* **Doran** chooses **“Jungle’s fault.”**
* **Oner** chooses **“Top’s fault.”**

**Doran:** “I’m a little worried about next year because of this… after the ceremony, we’ll talk separately.”

**Su-jin:** Today, we’re sending Doran to the “truth room.”  Alright. Then Oner why?

**Oner:** Even a random passerby can see top is a 1v1 lane. If you lose, you should admit it, but blaming someone else because you can’t admit it? I don’t think that’s good.

**Hye-ji:** That’s the jungler mindset. I totally relate.

**Su-jin:** Junglers have to watch so many lanes, you can’t always go top.

---

**When Peyz has a chance for a pentakill (steal it vs. give it)?**

Oner and Faker both chose “give it.”

**Su-jin**: That’s insane. you matched?

**Hye-ji**: Let’s hear Peyz first. How do you feel right now?

**Peyz**: I’m really grateful if they give it to me, I’d feel great.

**Hye-ji**: You said you’d give it. Faker are you serious?

**Faker**: I would give it… but I think one of the two of us is lying.

**Su-jin**: Oh really? If one of you is lying, who is it, Oner?

**Hye-ji**: We genuinely don’t know who “steals well.” Oner, you’re saying you’ll give it?

**Oner:** The one who lies usually accuses others first. I’m not lying. 

**Oner:** Every game, I try to give it, but sometimes situations happen where it doesn’t work out. My heart is huge: I really want to give it.

**Hye-ji**:**:** So you wanted to give it, but it “got stolen” inevitably?

**Oner:** Sometimes that kind of thing happens, like a natural disaster… you know?

**Su-jin**: Right, stuff can happen suddenly even if you didn’t intend it.

**Hye-ji**: If that happens, Peyz, how would you feel? It’s a pentakill and Oner stole it.

**Peyz:** If it makes for a funny moment, it’s fine. I think it’s okay.

**Su-jin:** He’s ready. 

**Hye-ji**: Nice.

**Su-jin**: And since he recently got a pentakill, he probably has a bit more emotional leeway right now.

**Best kind of celebratory team dinner after a win (Haidilao vs. Korean beef)?**

Peyz and Keria both chose **Haidilao**.

**Su-jin:** No hesitation at all. Any reason?

**Peyz:** I personally think Haidilao is tastier and easier to enjoy.

**Hye-ji:** What about you, Keria? Wasn’t it hard to choose?

**Keria:** I don’t really like beef that much. I find it kind of not tasty, too greasy, so I don’t like it much.

**Hye-ji:** Then what do you eat at Haidilao?

**Keria:** I still eat beef, but I knew you’d say that. We asked the bottom duo, and there’s more.

**Hye-ji:** That’s why I asked.

**Keria:** Grilled beef and beef in hotpot are different, so… for a moment I felt like I got “hit by a god-tier mindgame.”

**Hye-ji:** Then do you have a favorite vegetable?

**Keria:** At Haidilao? I think bok choy is the best.

**Hye-ji:** Peyz?

**Peyz:** I really love napa cabbage.

**Su-jin:** Looks like there’s a “meat team” and a “veggie team.”

**Hye-ji:** Anyway, it seems like everyone really loves Haidilao.

**Su-jin:** We already talked about red broth vs white broth earlier, so we can get back to that later. Now a question for Doran and Peyz.

---

**At your own wedding, who would you have sing the congratulatory song (Doran vs. Oner)?**

Doran chose **himself**, and Peyz chose **Oner**.

**Hye-ji:** Fun. Doran, your answer is “Doran sings,” right?

**Doran:** Doesn’t the person sing at their own wedding too?

**Su-jin:** But Oner singing for you is also an option, why did you choose that?

**Doran:** I thought matching the “correct answer” was what mattered. I assumed Peyz would pick me, so I picked to match… but now I feel kind of wronged

**Su-jin:** Wait, this is getting big?

**Hye-ji:** Yeah. I saw people saying they want to hear Doran sing, but Peyz chose Oner. Why?

**Peyz:** Honestly, my heart wants Doran’s skills….but I thought Doran might pick Oner, so I kind of wavered.

**Hye-ji:** I see. 

**Su-jin:** Oner, how do you feel hearing that?

**Oner:** I didn’t do anything and I’m a bit sad… But honestly, I’d be happy no matter who sings.

**Hye-ji:** If a teammate asked “sing at my wedding,” would you accept?

**Oner:** Huh? I don’t really like doing it… but there are a lot of good singers on our team.

**Hye-ji:** Who?

**Oner:** Su-hwan sings really well, Sanghyeok too, and now Doran and Keria, everyone knows they sing well.

**Hye-ji:**  Then if you had to pick one teammate to ask for a wedding song, who? No reason needed. Just pick. One, two, three. Wow, blocking is hard, okay, Oner’s pick is…

**Oner:**  I’ll go with Faker.

**Hye-ji:** Faker, congratulations.

**Faker:** huh?

**Su-jin:** POG Faker.

**Hye-ji:** Best player, must be an amazing singer.

---

**If you could only play one type of champion (fighter vs. tank)?**

Faker chose **fighter**, Keria chose **tank**.

**Faker:** I picked Fighter champs because I thought Keria would.

**Keria:** I thought Faker would choose tank.

---

**What’s most important in-game (laning vs. teamfights)?**  
Faker chose **teamfights**, Keria chose **laning**.

**MCs:** Ah, this split again.

**Su-jin:** Right. But this one really feels like it’d be 50/50, so can we hear the laning side first?

**Keria:** I’m a bot laner, if bot lane falls behind in lane, the whole game basically has no solution. So from a bot lane perspective, laning is really important.

**Su-jin:** Because after you win, you roam and take control of vision. Then Faker, what’s the reason for teamfights?

**Faker:** Because League is a teamfight game.

**Hye-ji:** Ah, that kind of reason.

---

**Head coach, and the two coaches. Here’s the question: Bae Hyeji vs. Go Sujin. One, two, three.**

They all choose Go Su-jin. Mata chooses Bae Hye-ji

Su-jin:Thank you. 

Hye-ji: Let’s hear the reason. Go Sujin.

kkOma: Yes?

Hye-ji: You didn’t know who Go Sujin was, did you?

kkOma: Yeah, yeah.

Hye-ji: Alright, give us your reason.

kkOma: The only woman for me is my wife.

Hye-ji:  That’s extremely logical. Totally understandable. Okay, next…

Tom: For me, since the head coach knows Go Sujin and would pick him, I picked him to match the answer.

Hye-ji: To accommodate the head coach. Okay, got it. Mata, you weren’t like this, though.

Mata: I chose Hye-ji because these days she’s on a lot of programs,  and I think she’s been showing a really good side of herself.
H
ye-ji: Faker, why did you look over like that?

Faker:  I didn’t say anything.

Hye-ji:  I should work harder. In 2026. Right.

Su-jin: I’ll work harder.

Hye-ji:  Alright, let’s hear a short message for caster Go Sujin.

Su-jin: Thank you. Thanks a lot. Great.

---

**In your first year after joining T1, when was the happiest moment?**

**Doran:** I think I was happiest right when I signed the contract. Not like “moved-to-tears” happiness just like, “Nice,” feeling good, purely in a good mood. That kind of happiness. About that much.


---
**Aside from gameplay skill, what ability did you grow the most after becoming a pro?**

**Oner:** I wasn’t someone who talked a lot, and I was kind of timid, with pretty low self-confidence. But after becoming a pro, doing various activities, and also doing YouTube, I’ve started talking a lot more, and my confidence has gone up a bit too. I think I’ve been living/doing things better in that sense, so maybe those parts have improved.

---

**You said you’re grateful and moved to re-sign, what does T1 mean to you, and how do you want to be remembered?**

**Oner:** Honestly, rather than it having some special “meaning,” I think I just did it because I wanted to. And more than how I want to be remembered, I’m curious how fans will think of me at the end. I think I just need to do my best so people can remember me in a good way. If I end up being someone fans don’t think of in a negative way, I’ll be satisfied, so I’d be really grateful if you think of me like that.

---

**We heard Faker can’t eat hot pot because of stomach issues, did you follow the doctor’s orders, or eat something else?**

**Faker:**  I did eat it the day before yesterday, but I only had one bite, so that much is… fine, right? I just “ate it briefly,” so I think it’s okay. But compared to before, I’ve been eating the clear broth a lot more.

**Hye-ji:** Your voice sounds really sad.

**Su-jin:** It is. Have you found something to replace hotpot?

**Faker**: I’m replacing it with shabu-shabu.

---

**After Christmas, we saw you went to a bookstore, what book did you buy?**

**Faker:**  I went to Kyobo, but I didn’t buy a book, I bought some board games and a diary.

**Hye-ji:**  Can you tell us what board game you bought?

**Faker:** I thought I’d need it around Christmas, like I might need a “board game friend,” so I bought a few.

**Su-jin:** Oh, so you bought several.

**Hye-ji:** Do you usually write in a diary?

**Faker:** I used one in 2023, but last year and this year I didn’t really keep up with it, so I’m planning to write again next year.

---

**After joining T1, you were surprised by the fans’ enthusiasm, any memorable moment?**

**Peyz:**  We recently went to Vietnam for an event, and the fans cheered so passionately, so that’s what I remember most. It was incredible.

**Q: This year was your first time building synergy with the team, who are you most excited to play with?**

**Peyz:** When I watched T1 matches, everyone was so good, so I was excited in general, but I think I’m most excited about the support player, Keria.

---

 **Keria, when you do personal streams, would you be willing to play horror games?**

**Keria:** This was like two years ago? People asked me to play a famous game called “8 Minutes…”, and back then I kind of forced my reactions, and I felt a lot of secondhand embarrassment / self-loathing about it. So horror games don’t really feel scary to me, but I’ll try to find something that might actually feel scary.

**Hye-ji:** I also saw you talking about getting sleep paralysis recently, you said you got it in Vietnam, right?

**Keria:** Yes, that’s right.

**Hye-ji:** Which is scarier: sleep paralysis, or horror games?

**Keria:** Sleep paralysis is fine because I know how to break out of it.

**Su-jin:** Then tell the fans how to break out of it.

**Keria:**  I saw it on Reels about a year ago, when you’re stuck, you should swear, and if you swear while getting up, you can get up.

**Hye-ji:** Please don’t swear here.

**Keria:** But seriously, it worked.

**Hye-ji:**  Really? That’s vivid, and hilarious.

---

**What food and experience in Vietnam were most memorable? And please come again.**

**Keria:** The day I had sleep paralysis in Vietnam, I woke up and went to eat pho, and it was unbelievably good, like “best ever.” If I get the chance, I want to go there again.

**Su-jin:** So it tasted like it was possessed by a ghost.

**Keria:** And for the “experience”… after eating pho, I went somewhere by a river to this place called Cong Cafe, and I had a coconut coffee (I think). It was really good. It’s not exactly an “experience,” but anyway, that’s the episode.

**Su-jin:** That sounds like it could be a whole route when you go to Vietnam.

**Hye-ji:**  Yeah, pho, then coconut coffee.

**Hye-ji:** And Doran, you know how to say “I ate pho” in Vietnamese really well. Do you still remember it?  Give us a Vietnamese greeting, please do it for your Vietnam fans.

**Doran:** I ate pho this morning.

**Hye-ji:** He still remembers.

**Su-jin:** Vietnam fans might be watching online, this is so moving. “Moving-ran”.

**Hye-ji:** So Keria recommends the route: pho, then coconut coffee. 

---

**Final messages to fans**

**kkOma:**  Like I said earlier, thank you sincerely once again to the fans who came to watch the kickoff event in this cold weather. Next year, we’ll do our absolute best as a team so that our fans can smile a lot, and we can show good performance. Please continue supporting T1 until the very end. And I hope you all have a joyful year-end. Thank you.

**Tom:** Next year as well, we’ll keep working hard to show a consistently good, and win many games with more diverse “win patterns,” so we can become champions. Thank you.

**Mata:** We’ll win again next year.

**Doran:**  This year, thanks to the fans, I was really happy. Next year, with your support, I’ll come back with even better performance. Thank you.

**Oner:**  I’m really grateful for all the support I received this year. Next year too, if you cheer for us as hard as you did this year, we’ll do our best to show fun games and enjoyable games. Also, I hope you wrap up the year well, and for those who came today, it’s really cold, so please get home safely. We’ll show good performance next year too. Thank you.

**Faker:**  Next year as well, I want to show a good performance, and I want to keep showing that I’m improving. Thank you.

**Peyz:**  So that fans can be happy, I’ll prepare hard with my teammates next year and show good performance. Thank you.

**Keria:** First, fans, thank you for your hard work today. Next year too, I’ll work hard so I can show you a lot of good sides of myself, and I’ll show you many good performances next year. Happy New Year.",18,1768064880.0,leagueoflegends,6,0.95,False

1q99efz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1q99efz/took_a_night_job_that_paid_too_much_the_building/,Took a Night Job That Paid Too Much. The Building Keeps Hiring Me.,"If you’re reading this because you’re job hunting and you’ve got that tab open with “overnight compliance” gigs, close it.

I’m not saying every warehouse is evil. I’m saying the one I walked into last Tuesday does not let people leave in the order they arrived.

I’ve been replaying the same small details because they’re the only parts that still feel normal. The smell of stale coffee in the lobby. The cheap blue carpet that never got vacuumed right. A little acrylic sign on a folding table that said VISITORS PLEASE SIGN IN, written in neat block letters with a dead marker that was running out of ink.

I remember thinking: this is it. This is where my life gets un-stuck. A boring job in a boring building.

That’s what made it work.

The pay rate was the first red flag. More per hour than I’d ever made and no experience required. The posting had a corporate name that sounded like it came from a generator, something like “Hawthorne Asset Compliance.” The address was an industrial park off a state road.

It also had a suite number.

Suite 6.

I remember that because I almost laughed at it. My whole life has been “six” lately. Six late fees. Six missed calls. Six dollars left in my checking account after rent. It felt like the universe trying to be clever.

I screenshotted the posting before I left my apartment because something about it felt flimsy, like it could vanish the second I committed to it. The image is still on my laptop now: the company name at the top, the pay rate, and the address line with Suite 6 on it. It even has that little “posted 2 days ago” tag and the generic stock photo of a warehouse aisle. I stared at the screenshot after everything happened, like it might explain why my hands were shaking.

I called anyway because my landlord didn’t care about red flags. My car insurance didn’t care. The balance on my card didn’t care.

A woman answered on the second ring. Pleasant. Calm. Like she’d been waiting for my call specifically.

“Orientation is tonight,” she said, before I could even finish introducing myself. “Nine p.m. sharp. Bring ID. No personal electronics past the front desk.”

That last part made me pause. I asked why.

“It’s a controlled environment,” she replied. “It’s for your safety.”

Then she said, “You’ll do fine,” in a way that felt less like encouragement and more like someone reading a line from a script they’d used on a lot of people.

At 8:52 p.m., I pulled into the lot and killed my headlights. The building was a long, low shape with a blank face, broken only by loading bay doors and one lit entryway. No cars. No security booth. Just a single camera dome above the door and a glowing EXIT sign visible through the glass.

I sat in my car for a full minute with my hands on the wheel, watching that doorway, waiting for the part where someone else showed up so I didn’t have to be the only idiot walking in.

No one did.

Inside was warmer than it should’ve been. Not cozy warm. Machine warm. Like you’d walked into a place that had been running for a long time without anyone opening a window.

A folding table had been set up like a check-in station. Clipboard. Pen chained down with a metal coil. A little black lockbox with numbered slots, like the kind a gym uses for phones. Above it was a printed sign:

NO PERSONAL ELECTRONICS BEYOND THIS POINT.

FAILURE TO COMPLY RESULTS IN TERMINATION.

Termination. Not “dismissal.” Not “rescinded offer.” Termination.

I wrote my name on the clipboard.

It was already there.

Not typed on the page as a list of applicants. Actually there. My name, in ink, in handwriting that looked like mine, sitting on the first line like I’d signed it earlier and then forgotten.

Under my name was a time: 9:00 p.m.

It was 8:56.

Behind me, a door clicked.

I turned, expecting someone who could explain it. A woman in a gray blazer stood there holding a lanyard and a badge like she’d been there the whole time.

Mid-fifties. Hair pulled back tight. No jewelry. No perfume. No small talk energy. Her expression was polite in the way a flight attendant looks right before turbulence.

“Welcome,” she said. “ID, please.”

I handed it over. She checked it without looking at me.

“Any electronics?”

I hesitated. “Just my phone.”

“Slot six,” she said, and pointed.

I slid my phone in and watched her punch in a code I couldn’t see. The lockbox beeped once, soft, like a microwave button.

She handed me my badge.

White plastic. My photo printed on it.

I did not take a photo for this job. I had not emailed them anything. The photo on the badge was me standing in this same lobby, under this same harsh overhead lighting, looking slightly off-camera like someone had called my name and I turned too late.

My stomach dropped so hard my hands went cold.

She put a laminated page into my hands. The kind of thing you’d see on a factory floor with a hole punched in the corner and a zip tie.

On top, in bold:

NIGHT COMPLIANCE ORIENTATION

READ ALL RULES BEFORE PROCEEDING.

1. Do not run. Running indicates panic. Panic triggers automatic containment.

2. Do not remove your badge. Doors respond to your badge and your badge responds to you.

3. If the building offers you a choice, choose quickly. Indecision is noncompliance.

4. You will hear voices. Use only the radio provided at checkpoints. Do not respond to voices in the hallway.

5. If you see yourself, do not approach yourself.

I flipped it over.

If you are reading this and your name is already signed in the lobby, you have already completed orientation. Proceed anyway.

I looked up at her. “This is a joke, right?”

She didn’t blink. “It’s a controlled environment,” she said again, like that meant everything.

The door behind us clicked shut.

We were in a corridor that looked like any industrial back hallway. Beige cinderblock. Gray epoxy floor. Fluorescent lights with a faint buzz. An OSHA poster about lifting safely. A faded sticker on a door that said EYEWASH STATION.

She walked to the end, tapped a wall panel, and a metal door slid open with a heavy, smooth sound. A security door.

“Orientation is a route,” she said. “Checkpoint A is ahead. Sign in. Follow instructions. When you reach the end, you’ll exit to the lobby.”

She stepped backward through the door.

“Wait,” I blurted. “Are you coming with me?”

“No,” she said. “You’re alone. That’s part of the assessment.”

The door slid shut between us and sealed with a solid clunk.

I walked because standing still felt worse.

Checkpoint A was a small alcove with a camera in the corner and a waist-high metal podium. Clipboard, pen, and a small plastic radio bolted down by a cable.

CHECKPOINT A: PPE AUDIT

SELECT ONE.

Two lockers. One labeled FLASHLIGHT. One labeled GLOVES.

The hallway ahead was dark. Not dim. Dark, like the lights didn’t exist past a certain point.

From that darkness, something scraped. Slow. Metal on concrete. Then it stopped, like it had listened for my reaction.

I opened the FLASHLIGHT locker.

Inside was a cheap, heavy-duty flashlight with a wrist strap. Not new. The handle was worn smooth where fingers had gripped it.

The GLOVES locker clicked once, as if locking itself permanently.

I signed the clipboard. My name was already there again, beneath my earlier signature, with a time: 9:14 p.m.

It was 9:06.

A soft buzzer sounded, sharp like a timer starting. The wall panel beside the next door lit up green.

The moment I stepped into the dark hallway, the air changed. Cooler. Damp, in a way that made my nose itch. My flashlight beam caught dust floating like snow.

The scraping sound happened again, farther ahead. I swung the light and caught something low and curved across the floor.

Wire mesh.

Razor mesh. The kind that bites.

The hallway was narrow. No way around. Above it, a sign:

ANTI-THEFT BARRIER ACTIVE.

DO NOT REMOVE.

PROCEED WITH APPROVED PPE.

Approved PPE. Gloves.

I didn’t have them.

I crawled anyway. Slow and careful, trying to keep my sleeves between skin and metal.

It still found me.

The first cut was a sting on the back of my hand. The second ran longer across my forearm and bled hot, then cold. I gritted my teeth and kept moving because stopping meant sitting on it.

Halfway through, the mesh scraped again, like something on the other end had pulled it.

My flashlight beam jumped and landed on the far end of the hallway where the light came back.

Someone was crouched there.

A man in an employee lanyard, squatting low like he’d been watching me crawl.

My face. My hair. The same badge shape at his chest.

Me.

The lights flickered once and he was gone. Just concrete and a closed door.

Rule five sat in my head like a weight.

I crawled the rest of the way with my eyes locked on the floor.

Checkpoint B was brighter. Same podium. Same camera. Same bolted radio.

CHECKPOINT B: SPILL RESPONSE

STOP THE ALARM.

A red light flashed. There was a continuous beep like a dying smoke detector, only louder.

A shallow puddle spread from a cracked plastic jug on the floor. It looked like water until my flashlight caught a rainbow sheen.

90 SECONDS UNTIL VENTILATION SHUTDOWN.

There was a mop bucket chained to the wall. A box of absorbent pads locked behind a clear plastic cover with a keypad. A panel with a slot labeled BADGE.

I swiped.

The beeping sped up. The cover clicked open. A little screen displayed four numbers: 9:14, then 9:15, then 9:16, like a clock. Like time was being used as a code.

I punched 914 on instinct and the cover snapped open.

Inside were only two pads.

Two.

I slapped one down. Then the other. The puddle still spread thin and shiny at the edges.

The overhead grates clicked. The air pressure shifted like the building inhaled and held it. A low hiss started and the smell changed to something hot and wrong, like burnt hair.

I grabbed the radio.

“Checkpoint B,” I said, forcing my voice steady. “Ventilation is doing something.”

Static, then a man’s voice, strained and low.

“Don’t breathe deep,” it said. “Keep your mouth covered. Badge panel on the right. Swipe twice.”

There was another badge slot half-hidden beside the pad cover. I swiped twice.

The hiss slowed, then stopped. The air felt normal again, except my throat had started to scratch.

I stared at the radio. “Who is this?”

Static.

Then, quieter: “Sign the clipboard. Move.”

I signed. The time next to my name was correct for the first time: 9:12 p.m.

Checkpoint C was where the warehouse stopped looking like a warehouse.

Cleaner paint. Newer lights. Framed policy posters like an office hallway.

BUDDY SYSTEM POLICY

NO EMPLOYEE ENTERS RESTRICTED ZONES ALONE.

CHECKPOINT C: CONFIRM YOUR PARTNER

DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL CONFIRMED.

The radio here wasn’t bolted down. It sat loose, like someone wanted me to take it.

A soft beep began overhead, like a countdown without a posted number.

I picked up the radio. It was warm.

“Partner confirmation,” I said.

Breathing crackled into the mic, close.

“Don’t hit the button,” a voice whispered.

It sounded like me.

“I’m on the other route,” it said. “If you hit yours, it closes mine. Please.”

I stared at the wall panel beside the next door. A large green button under a clear cover.

Rule three: if the building offers you a choice, choose quickly.

“My name is already signed in the lobby,” I said, half to myself.

“Yeah,” the voice replied. “That means you already did this. It means you already chose.”

The overhead lights flickered.

In the glass of a framed policy across the hall, my reflection didn’t match my posture. It stood straighter. Clean. Not bleeding.

It smiled at me.

The cover over the green button clicked open by itself.

I hit the button.

Somewhere far away, a door slammed hard enough to echo.

On the radio, the voice made a sound like it had been punched. “You idiot,” it whispered, and then the radio went dead.

Checkpoint D was a room.

Table. Chair. A two-way mirror on one wall. The air smelled like paper and old electronics.

On the table was a manila folder and a Polaroid.

The Polaroid was me standing in the lobby at the sign-in table. The timestamp read 9:00.

I flipped it over.

In handwriting that was mine: DON’T TRY TO LEAVE THROUGH THE LOBBY.

I opened the folder.

Incident reports. Checklists. Notes. A copy of the job posting I’d answered.

Then a page titled:

EMPLOYEE: \\\[MY NAME\\\]

STATUS: ACTIVE

SHIFT: NIGHTS

COMPLIANCE: IMPROVING

At the bottom was a signature line.

Signed by me.

Fresh.

I backed up until I hit the wall.

In the mirror, movement.

A cleaner version of me stepped into view like he’d been standing just out of frame. Badge straight. No blood. Laminated rules sheet in hand, stained along the edge like it had been carried a long time.

He pressed his palm to the glass.

I stayed where I was.

He lifted his sleeve and showed his forearm.

A thin, pale scar ran along the exact line of my fresh cut.

He smiled, tired, then mouthed words I could read.

You always do this part.

He pointed down to a small metal hatch at the bottom of the mirror.

CHECKPOINT D: EXIT ROUTE

DO NOT USE LOBBY EXIT.

USE SERVICE HATCH.

He mouthed again.

If you go to the lobby, you start over.

The building’s lights dimmed slightly, like it was listening.

I opened the hatch and climbed down a ladder into a service tunnel under the building. Bare concrete. Pipes overhead. Junction boxes with numbers stenciled on them.

On the wall were tally marks scratched into the concrete. Groups of five. Dozens of groups.

At the end was a metal door with an exit bar and a glowing EXIT sign.

I shoved it open and cold night air hit me so hard I almost cried.

I came out into a back lot behind the building. Gravel. Weeds. Chain-link fence. Distant streetlight glow.

I walked the fence line toward the front, toward the lobby, toward my phone and my keys.

Halfway there, the lobby lights brightened.

The woman in the gray blazer stepped into view behind the glass and looked straight at me like she’d been waiting.

She pointed down, toward the lockbox.

Then she made a small motion with her fingers, like tapping a code.

I froze.

Because I didn’t know the code.

And if the building wanted me back inside, all it had to do was keep my phone and keys behind that glass and let panic do the rest.

I turned away from the lobby.

My car was still where I’d parked it. Keys were in my pocket. I got in, locked the doors, and started the engine on the second try because my hands were shaking too much to do it clean.

The radio in my car came on by itself.

Not music.

A calm voice through the speakers, like an announcement.

“Welcome aboard,” it said.

I slapped the power button and the voice cut off.

I drove until the building was just another dark shape in my rearview.

I didn’t go home right away. I went to a twenty-four hour gas station off the highway and sat under the canopy lights where people could see me. I bought water, gauze, tape, and wrapped my arm in the bathroom.

When I peeled my sleeve back, the cut along my forearm had started to tack up, and the fabric stuck to it in a way that made my stomach roll. The skin around it was already getting puffy and pink, and there were tiny dark flecks in the shallow slices on my wrist like the mesh left grit behind. I rinsed until the water ran clear, but the burn smell from that ventilation moment was still in my nose, like it had coated the back of my throat. The first strip of tape didn’t hold because my hands wouldn’t stop sweating.

I asked the cashier to use the store phone and called 911.

I told them I’d been trapped in a building, my phone was inside, I was bleeding, and I needed someone to meet me before I did something stupid like drive back there alone.

An officer showed up. I showed him the cuts. I showed him the laminated rules sheet. I told him about the lockbox and the lobby and the “orientation route,” trying to keep my story straight even while part of me kept waiting for the lights in the gas station to flicker the same way.

He read the rules without reacting much. His eyes paused on rule five. His jaw tightened just a little.

He asked what the company was called. I told him.

He asked what the building looked like. I described it down to the folding table and the sign.

He asked if I had any proof on my email or texts.

“My phone is in a lockbox,” I said, and it sounded pathetic even to me.

He offered to follow me back so we could at least retrieve my property.

He studied me for a long second and said, “I’ve had people call in after getting hurt at illegal escape rooms. Corporate team-building stuff. Same vibe.” He didn’t say it like an accusation, more like he needed a box to put me in so the night made sense. Then he glanced down at my bandaged arm and added, quieter, “But those places don’t usually involve this much blood.” The way he said usually made my stomach drop all over again.

We drove to the industrial park.

The building was there.

That should have made me feel better. It didn’t.

From the road, it looked exactly right. Same blank face. Same loading bay doors. Same entryway.

But the sign out front was different.

Not “Hawthorne Asset Compliance.” Not anything like that.

It was a generic logistics company name in big, clean letters, the kind you see on a hundred warehouses and never remember. The lot had cars now. Not a lot, but enough to make it look lived in. A security truck idled near the entrance like it belonged there.

The officer parked. I parked behind him.

As soon as we got out, the security truck rolled forward and stopped near the entryway, close enough to make a point without actually blocking us.

A big guy in a reflective vest got out, clipboard in hand like it was glued there.

The officer asked if a company called Hawthorne Asset Compliance operated out of here.

The guard didn’t even have to think. “No,” he said. “Never heard of it.”

The officer asked for the suite directory. The guard pointed at a placard by the door.

It listed units.

4A. 4B. 5A. 5B.

No 6.

The officer looked back at me. Not accusing. Just… measuring.

I swallowed. “The posting said Suite 6,” I said. “She told me slot six. It was always six.”

The guard snorted like I’d said something funny.

“There’s no suite six in this building,” he said. “Hasn’t been. This park numbers by row. You want six, you go two buildings down.”

The officer asked if we could step inside the lobby to check. Just to retrieve my property, if nothing else.

The guard shook his head. “Not without a manager,” he said. “And I’m not calling someone out because a guy says he got hired by a company that doesn’t exist.”

The officer asked about security footage.

The guard said there were cameras, sure, but he couldn’t hand footage over without a report and a request and the right paperwork.

While they talked, the officer flicked on his flashlight and slowly swept it across the entryway glass and the concrete just inside.

“Hold up,” he said.

He leaned closer to the bottom of the door, where the light from inside spilled onto the threshold.

“There,” he said, and pointed.

At first I didn’t see it. Then my eyes caught a tiny dark dot on the concrete right inside the glass, almost where I’d stood earlier, under where the folding table used to be.

The officer crouched, took a folded white napkin from his pocket, and pressed it to the dot. He rubbed once.

The napkin came away with a faint rusty smear.

The guard’s face changed for half a second. Not guilt. Not surprise. More like irritation, like a fly had landed on him.

“That could be anything,” the guard said quickly. “People cut themselves. We got workers in and out. That doesn’t mean—”

The officer stood, eyes still on the smear. “I’m not saying what it means,” he said, and his voice had gone quieter. “I’m saying it’s there.”

The guard’s expression snapped back into place. “You want to file a report, file it,” he said. “You want a manager, come back during business hours. Otherwise, you’re done here.”

The officer did what he could. He took my statement. He photographed my injuries. He wrote down the address and the unit list and the guard’s name. He told me, gently, that without proof of employment or a visible lockbox or anyone inside acknowledging me, he couldn’t force entry.

He asked me if I had someone who could stay with me.

I told him I was fine.

I was not fine.

I went home and slept with the lights on.

At 7:03 a.m., I opened my laptop and checked my email.

There was a message from “Hawthorne Asset Compliance.”

Subject line: SHIFT CONFIRMATION

One paragraph:

We’re glad you completed orientation. Please arrive tonight at 9:00 p.m. sharp.

Remember: No personal electronics past the front desk. Slot six is reserved for you.

Attached was a PDF.

I opened it.

It was my badge photo.

Me in the lobby. Under the same harsh lights. Looking slightly off-camera like someone had called my name and I turned too late.

Only in this photo, my forearm wasn’t freshly cut.

It had a pale scar in the exact shape of last night’s injury.

I’m posting this now because I don’t know what happens if I ignore it. I don’t know if the building will come to me, or if it will just keep adjusting reality until I show up like I always do.

I do know this: I tried to delete the email three times.

It keeps coming back.

And when I close my eyes, I can still see tally marks scratched into concrete by a hand that looks like mine.

If you find a job posting that promises easy money and a “controlled environment,” and they tell you to put your phone in a lockbox, don’t tell yourself it’s just policy.

And if you walk into a lobby and your name is already signed in, leave.

Because if you don’t, you’ll make it to the part where you see yourself behind the glass, clean and tired, showing you the scar you haven’t earned yet.

And you’ll realize the building isn’t trying to kill you.

It’s trying to keep you employed.",2,1768064762.0,TheDarkArchive,0,0.75,False

The R&D Lab section of Stark Tower, commonly called the *Maiden*, was a place where the most innovative and cutting-edge technology that Stark Industries could provide. It didn't look like it was worth billions of dollars, but rather looked like a scrapyard covered in scattered armor pieces, tools, and spent energy cells. Workbenches overflowed with circuit boards and dismantled gauntlets, while a towering holographic display projected schematics into the air, casting a blue glow across the room.

At the center of the *Maiden* was Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries and the Invincible Iron Man, dressed in a simple black tank top and pants. And tonight, he was working on creating the latest Iron Man armor to add to his growing collection.

The *Maiden* was Tony's personal lab in R&D, where he kept all his files, his blueprints, and armor in one place. Only he, his friends, and select others in the company had access to it. After the gang war and the Maggia almost stealing his tech, Tony had to add extra measures into the security in Stark Tower to prevent theft in the future, to keep not just his technology and secrets safe, but the people who were put in harm's way, as well.

Tony looked back at the projection to read the blueprint for his newest Iron Man armor plans, which he has come to call the *‘Heavy Set’.* Like the name suggested, it was the heaviest armor he had made so far, adding extra protection to protect his chest and damaged heart.

*‘Am I one step closer to understanding the Mark 99?’* Stark commented mentally, turning to another armor standing at the center alongside all the others he had made so far. Its sleek red and silver paint shone under the lights. The Mark 99 had been a gift from Immortus when Tony and the Avengers had had to deal with his variants and stop Kang. It was the most advanced piece of technology Tony had ever seen, tech that was yet to exist. And Tony, whenever he had free time away from being the CEO of one of the largest corporations in the world as well as being a superhero, got to learn new things from it, in turn giving him new inspirations for his newest armor suits.

“Sir,” the AI JARVIS’s calm British voice interrupted the low hum of tools. “You have a guest.”

Tony flicked his wrist, dismissing a projection, and frowned at a diagnostic readout. “Tell them I’m in a meeting. And if it's Pepper, tell her I’m cool with whatever idea she has for the upcoming gala.”

“It is Mr. Cage, sir.” 

“Luke’s here? In the lobby?”

“Behind you,” a new voice spoke up, and Tony spun around to see a newcomer entering the room as it slid open. Luke Cage entered with heavy footfalls. “You sure take your time to answer your calls.”

“Jesus, Luke,” Tony said in feigned shock, pulling off his goggles. “A little heads up next time? I could've been working on something dangerous, or worse, I could have been naked.”

“You know, I’m sure people have caught you in more embarrassing states,” Luke said and shook his head. “And I've been waiting for fifteen minutes.”

“You have been waiting for sixteen minutes and forty-one seconds, Mr. Cage,” JARVIS noted. “Mr. Stark ignored my call for the entire duration.”

Tony sighed. “Getting called out by my own creation… not the first time, mind you.”

Luke hummed in response, scanning the laboratory and seeing the littered pieces of the Iron Man armor, discarded when they didn’t fit Tony’s desires.

“So what’s this about, Stark?” Luke began, leaning against a nearby table. “You said you wanted to meet.”

Tony clapped his hands, and the armor schematics dissolved into a massive holographic database, showing various names and profiles.

“Is this…?” Luke read through the names, recognizing some such as Punisher and Spider-Man.

“The Hero Initiative,” Tony answered proudly. “Anyone who accepted my pager or even just caught my eye, all saved together in one place.”

“It feels like a watch list,” Luke commented. “In the wrong hands, it could end up putting everyone at risk.”

“Don’t worry, everything’s covered with most expensive cyber security money can buy, enhanced by yours truly,” Tony said in confidence as he waved his hand and two profiles appeared from the pile.

The first was Iron Fist, real name: Danny Rand, CEO of Rand Industries. A master martial artist, hailed as one of the very best, and who possessed, according to Danny himself, the power of the Iron Fist, empowering himself with Chi. The second profile was of Katherine ‘Kate’ Bishop, ‘the other Hawkeye’, heiress to the Bishop fortune and a world-class markswoman rivaling Clint Barton, the first Hawkeye and current SHIELD agent.

“So any opinions on the two new members of our ever growing team? Or any difficulties after you talked to them?” Tony asked.

“Danny said yes right away, even set his Defenders idea for later. But Kate took a lot of convincing.” He turned to Tony. “She’s not a big fan of the idea of working with you specifically. Said - and I’m quoting her here, ‘Tony Stark is an asshole and who cares more about branding and sponsorships than helping people’.”

Tony laughed. “I like her already, and just so you know, I do have some ideas on the branding but with everyone’s input, of course.”

He flicked his hand to show two more profiles, one that belonged to Tony and the other to Luke. Iron Man and Power Man, stacked together with Iron Fist and Hawkeye. Then the familiar logo appeared above them, Tony's most important project to date.

*The New Avengers*, replacing the old with the new.

“Now we've got your suggestions,” he swiped the team profile aside to show two more profiles. “We turn to mine.”

The new profile appeared, it showed numerous video recordings of a man in white fighting Maggia remnants in one clip, another showed him knocking out a Purifier attacking some mutants, and another showed the man in white clearly saluting the camera. Even though it was blurry, it was clear that he was smiling at the camera before disappearing like a ghost.

“This bold gentleman goes by Fantomex,” Tony began, taking a seat as he read through the profile. “Couldn’t find much on him, and trust me, I had JARVIS scrub everywhere. All we got is that the guy used to be a merc with contracts all over, managed to piss off a lot of crime syndicates, got himself a bounty on his head too,” Tony noted, looking impressed as he read off every job that JARVIS had managed to collect that Fantomex had taken. “And now he’s the protector of the mutant refuge right here in New York after stopping Hammerhead during the gang war.”

Luke crossed his arms. “Not sure about this guy. Recruiting when we don’t even know his name, his goals, or his history? He could have been an assassin for all we know.”

“Maybe, but after reading what we got, he earned at least a look at,” Tony noted, sounding curious and eager to meet this Fantomex. “The team might need a ghost, a wild card, someone who can go in and out without notice, and probably do things more… nonconventional.”

Luke was clearly not supportive of the idea, but said nothing more.

Tony swiped again, and a new profile appeared, a SHIELD file. It showed a mug shot of a red-haired woman being arrested, followed by two video recordings. One recording showed the woman fighting a team of mutants in Los Angeles, and another, which appeared to have happened recently in London, showed her lifting rubble from a bus to save the people inside.

“Wanda Maximoff,” Tony began. “Goes by ‘Scarlet Witch’, has a long list of laundry here, and as the name suggests, she likes to wear red, just my kind of gal.”

Luke read through Wanda’s profile; unlike Fantomex's small profile, hers was extensive. Daughter of the infamous Magneto, a mutant and user of Chaos Magic, former member of the Brotherhood of Mutants, and her fair share of chaos before a young team of X-Men stopped her, putting her under SHIELD’s care in their Ice Chest prison, which was then broken out by her dad and the Brotherhood. She played a role in what was known as the “Wundagore Incident”, and later on, she and her brother helped the X-Men put a stop to a series of *sinister* attacks that involved the revealed-to-be-villainous US Vice President.

As of the current information Tony had gathered, she was working with the mutant hero team Excalibur in the United Kingdom, although she hadn’t been active for the past couple of months.

“Any comments on her? Or do her pics speak for themselves?” Tony asked in his usual snarkiness.

“I do have comments, and no, they have nothing to do with her looks, and I know you’ll probably ignore them.”

“Good man,” Tony turned to Luke. “So here’s the plan to cover all our grounds. We take our newest members on a field trip! You and Danny head to M-Town. See if you can charm its ghost into joining. While I’ll take Bishop with me to England, I’ll check in with Psylocke from Excalibur and see what she knows about Maximoff’s whereabouts.”

“You’re really trying to mold this team into something specific, huh?”

“What gave it away?” Tony leaned back, smirking. 

“Just making sure this team doesn’t end up being a Stark Industries PR stunt. After you told me about it being independent from SHIELD, but all this…” He pointed at the various profiles Tony had gathered of all the heroes around the city and country. “Make it look like we are no different than SHIELD.”

“And I told you, it's not like that,” Tony said. “All this information I have is to make sure we don’t end up on SHIELD’s radar; the whole point of this is to avoid SHIELD oversight.”

“So it’s okay so long as it’s under *your* oversight?”

Tony said nothing, but it was enough of an answer for Luke.

Luke shook his head and turned to the door. “We’ll talk about this team, what it *should* be, after we get your recruits. Don’t think I won’t.”

“Looking forward to it,” Tony said, though his tone was dismissive.

When the doors slid shut, Tony exhaled and ran a hand through his hair.

“I have sent the message to your pilot, sir. The jet would be ready at 8 AM,” JARVIS said, always monotone. “I have sent a message to Ms. Bishop as well.”

“Thanks, JARVIS.” Tony picked up the helmet he was working on, staring at his reflection before going back to work. “Make it 10 AM instead, I am definitely not sleeping anytime soon.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

“Need another drink, handsome?”

Luke turned from the window. The server in front of him wore a bright yellow apron over a crisp white shirt, a paper hat tilted low over his eyes. His nametag read simply ‘*CC*’. He grinned like they were old friends.

“Yeah, sure.” Luke slid his mug across.

CC topped it off with practiced ease and filled it with fresh coffee. “But you sure you don’t want one of our specials? Pasta by Strong Guy himself. Best in town.”

Luke smirked faintly. “I’m good. Just waiting on someone.”

“Suit yourself.” CC winked and glided off.

The place was packed. Strong Cookin was one of M-Town’s pride spots, a mutant-owned diner with chrome counters, red vinyl booths, and walls covered in polaroids of smiling patrons. Luke liked it better than the high-class joints Tony used to drag him into.

He looked back into the window and saw the populated streets of M-Town. Even as the sun set, the streets still looked lively; you would think the place hadn't just gone through a Maggia invasion that nearly burned the whole place down, but the people had moved on, looking stronger than ever.

And he wondered if that was all thanks to its protector, Fantomex, who he had come to find out had earned the nickname as the Ghost of M-Town.

Luke was waiting for Danny Rand, who had told Luke that he had already met and worked with this Fantomex in dealing with the growing power vacuum after the Maggia and the Goblin Nation were gone, something many heroes had been dealing with all over the city.

Luke thought over how to approach this Fantomex guy. He had heard from all perspectives praising the guy, confused by his antics, and finding him rather dishonest in certain aspects. But he had also seen how much M-Town saw the guy as its protector. Someone had even made a wall graffiti for the guy that Luke had seen when he had first come into the neighborhood.

And yet, despite that, Luke had his reservations about Fantomex, and whether he could be relied on should he accept the offer to join the Avengers.

*Maybe Danny can sweet talk him. Because I don’t buy what this guy’s selling.*

He checked his phone again. Danny was late. Half an hour late. Not like him.

“Still waiting?”

Luke blinked. The same server stood there again, with that same easy smile.

“You could say so,” Luke muttered. “He usually isn’t the kind to just leave me waiting this long… unless there was something.”

“I’m sure Mr. Rand has his reasons.”

Luke froze mid-sip. He never gave him Danny's name. “…Excuse me?”

The man slid into the opposite booth, lowering his voice. His whole vibe shifted, with posture straighter and gaze sharp. His casual warmth remained but his eyes looked like he was studying Luke.

“Relax, *mon ami*. If I wanted a fight, I would have chosen a much better venue with the moon shining under us.”

Luke narrowed his eyes and studied the man in front of him, saw how his demeanor had changed from a flirtatious attendee to someone clearly scanning the room, keeping his identity hidden and announcing his presence to Luke.

Realization kicked in.

“It’s you. You're…”

The man tipped his paper hat off, revealing dark hair slicked back, a grin sharp enough to cut. “Fantomex. At your service.” He gave a small bow, voice lilting with the faint cadence of an unfamiliar accent. “Finally, the bald and beautiful Power Man himself. The pictures don’t do you justice.” He winked.

“So what? Is this your day job when you're not out there?” Luke asked, and Fantomex chuckled.

“That would be interesting,” Fantomex laughed. “By day, a handsome diner server. By night, prowling the rooftops, fighting for justice!” He leaned against the chair, his right eye flickering green for a second, mechanical iris spinning before dimming.

“So why the dress-up?”

“Simply enjoying the ups and downs of working in a diner.” He said with clear sarcasm.

Luke crossed his arms. “All I see is a guy sneaking around instead of being straight with me.”

He chuckled, then looked at Luke. “ln truth, I was watching you. Mr. Rand told me about a meeting, and when a wise sage told me that a certain Power Man entered our little M-Town, so I had to make sure.”

“About?”

“If you were here for coffee *or me*.”

“Maybe both,” Luke muttered. “I can take a guess you already know who Danny Rand really is?”

“*Bien sûr*. *Iron Fist.*” Fantomex said the name like it was obvious. “Your young friend hides his identity about as well as a glowstick in the dark. And it even took a wise Sage I know thirty minutes to confirm it.”

“Yeah… Danny can be quick to trust people…” Luke noted, which was both a praise and a criticism to the Young Dragon. “But where is he?”

“Now that's the one millionth dollar question.” Fantomex leaned against the chair, legs crossed. “I was waiting for Rand to show up, which would have been my cue to make my presence known to you. But the fact that he isn't here yet makes me wonder if he had something to delay him, possibly related to his company.”

Luke shook his head. “Nah, Danny always told me he doesn't prioritize his work with Rand Industries as much as his… other work.”

“Ah,” Fantomex clicked his finger. “I think I might know where he is.”

Luke raised an eyebrow, waiting for Fantomex to say what he would say.

“Before young Daniel asked to come for the meeting, I contacted him about a possible location for the Golden Tigers Triad’s leader Chaka, reputed information of course given to me by a trusted Sage. He and his Triad have been out of the city and the country after the Maggia-Goblin War, with some rumor suggesting he has been in business with the Triple Threat Syndicate over in Madripoor.”

“Yeah, Danny did stress to me that the Golden Tigers were the biggest threat in taking over the void the Maggia left behind,” Luke noted.

Fantomex nodded. “And he is correct there, by default, they are the biggest gang. They didn't lose much during the war, and with the Madripoor dealings, they might have an edge over everyone.”

“And what did you tell him?”

“That Chaka might be in town.”

Luke grimaced. Danny told him the stories about the Chaka, the Bloody Tiger, and how Iron Fist nearly died fighting him. And if that guy managed to give Iron Fist a run for his money, he was someone to be worried about if he ever wanted to take over the underworld throne Hammerhead had left behind.

“That means he might be looking for him now…” Luke realized, knowing how much Danny had been obsessively trying to stop Chaka. “Did you tell him where?”

Fantomex shrugged. “I mentioned somewhere near the Flooded District.” That was the area in between Harlem and the Upper East Side that was still affected by the flood from years ago.

Luke brought out the Hero Initiative pager and saw there was no call for help made by Iron Fist. “Dammit, Danny… he might be there now, and in trouble if he goes at it alone.” He knew how stubborn Danny could be, and he was willing to go through hell to take Chaka down.

“Maybe I can be of assistance.” Fantomex leaned closer. “I put young Daniel into the path, let me be the one who helps find him.”

“What can you do?” Luke asked. “No offence, but the Flooded District is like a haystack of mess on top of everything, even finding the Tigers is like finding a needle.”

“Not if you have a magnet for it,” Fantomex noted, his tone serious. “That pager, you can only find others if they activate it like a beacon.” Luke nodded. “Then I can work with that.”

“Hold on, you're thinking of hacking through this pager to find Danny?” Luke asked, confused. “That’ll take time, and I won't waste it while Danny is out there.”

“I know this meeting has something to do with impressing you… or at least, having you trust me.” Fantomex began. “I understand you being wary of me, especially with my little show of giving you coffee, but if we are to find Iron Fist, then you have to trust my abilities to find him.”

Luke was hesitant at first, wondering how the hell this turned from finding Fantomex to going after Iron Fist, but with a sigh, he gave Fantomex the pager.

Fantomex took a deep breath, and then, his right eye glowed green again, his iris shifting into something that looked electronic, scanning the pager as Fantomex stared at it, confusing Luke about what exactly he was doing.

*‘Is he… hacking the pager by touch?!’*

“Found him!” Fantomex announced, and Luke nodded as the two headed out of the diner. Luke gave a big tip to another server before the two headed into the Flooded District.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The air smelled of rust and salt water, remnants of the flood that took the city. The shadows stretched long through the beams of the warehouse, lit only by flickering lights.

Danny Rand kept his breath steady, measured. Focus his mind, still his heart.

He could hear Lei Kung the Thunderer’s voice echoing in his head. He remembered the long nights in K’un-Lun, fist raw and bleeding, body beaten from the intense drills to prepare him for his trials where he became the Iron Fist, Champion of the Heavenly City and Immortal Weapon.

**“Strength alone is a river in flood, destructive and uncontrollable. To control strength is to control an ocean, that is what it means to be the Iron Fist.”**

Lei Kung never gave him praise, only lessons, obstacles, riddles and criticism. Not even when Danny Rand defeated Shao Lao the Undying did his approach change, in fact, his lessons grew more intense.

**“You must know your limit, Daniel Rand-K’ai. For to be the Immortal Weapon, you must have no limits.”**

The memory snapped as sharp steel raked across his face. Danny twisted, ducking low, then drove his elbow up like a piston. Bone crunched. The Golden Tiger dropped.

Iron Fist found himself in a narrow hallway of the warehouse, the Golden Tigers’ newest warehouse after returning from Madripoor and abandoning Chinatown, finding a better place in the Flooded District.

Ahead, a half dozen Tigers waited, blades, maces, swords, claws glinting under the lights. Their golden tiger masks stared at him like hungry animals, and he was the prey that came to their lair.

With blood-stained hands, Iron Fist lunged first. He pivots, striking with Crashing Mountain Palm, sending the nearest Tiger's jaw sideways.

Another came from behind, Danny spun his heel, and the Whirlwind Dragon Kick hurled the Tiger into a wall.

Two more closed in, blades slicing for his chest. But Danny Rand flowed like water, sidestepped, seized a wrist, and broke it. The blade clattered, and Danny kicked it forward, and it stabbed the next Tiger's leg, screaming in pain.

The last came, a bigger one, charging, but Danny was already on him. He hit a fast jab to the throat, the Coiled Serpent Strike, forcing him to gasp. Then he followed it up with a Rising Phoenix Elbow, crushing his nose in a spray of blood and knocking him out cold.

Before he could savor his victory, he heard a massive steel door rumble as it began to close. Danny saw it was reinforced, strong enough to withstand an explosion.

Thankfully, he had something much stronger than explosives.

He stepped forward, taking a deep breath, and began to gather the flame within; the dragon on his chest roared brightly.

The Chi surged into his fist. It burned, hardened, and turned to Iron.

With a roar, he charged, driving his Iron Fist into the steel, and exploded off its hinges, and hurled across the room like a cannon, slamming into a far wall and catching a few Tigers who were standing on the way.

When the dust cleared, he saw an army of Golden Tigers. More than the ones he fought to get here. Guns at hand, all aiming at him. And at their head stood a familiar man.

Chaka the Bloody Tiger.

Unlike the rest of the clan, Chaka wore a smiling blood-red tiger mask, but Danny knew the man was not smiling. He wore an immaculate black suit, with a red tie that was sharper than the claws of his soldiers.

Resting along his neck like a snake was his signature weapon, a red three-section staff, the San Jie Gun, a weapon that earned him the “Chaka” title.

“Dragon,” Chaka greeted Iron Fist before turning to his men. “He's mine.”

They all took a step back for their leader as he began circling Danny. The two's history went back a long way, ever since Danny first came back to New York. Whenever Iron Fist disrupted a Golden Tigers deal, they sent Chaka. Their battle had grown more violent after each encounter, with Danny barely surviving each time.

With no other words, the two charged at each other, the Dragon and the Tiger.

The San Jie Gun flowed like a serpent, catching Iron Fist on the head, opening a shallow cut above his brows and into his mask. The Tigers roared in approval at the display.

Iron Fist pressed forward, exchanging blows with Chaka. He used the Leaping Crane Kick, but Chaka stomped his foot and shoved an elbow into the ribs. Danny tried to use Piercing Dragon Palm, but Chaka dodged and spat in his eye, before kicking him on the chest. Every time Danny gained an upper hand, the Bloody Tiger clawed back with dirty tricks, and the crown of Golden Tigers raised their claws and guns every time their boss faltered.

Danny knew it. If he somehow won this fight, he’d be gunned down instantly.

This was Chaka’s fight, his rules, *his* win.

Danny Rand had lost, and he knew it.

As the Tigers watched on, hyper-focused on the fight, they failed to notice a ghost walking among them, a ghost dressed in white and black.

*\*TicTicTicTic\**

Small grey balls rolled across the floor, bouncing and reaching between the onlooking Tigers’ boots.

Chaka shoved Iron Fist back and noticed the orbs before realization struck just as his voice cracked. “GET DOWN--!!”

The balls erupted into a blanket of smoke, sending the room into a haze. The Tigers coughed, confused and dazed as they tried to walk through the smoke.

“Ladies and gentlemen of the Golden Tigers!” A smooth voice rang out. “Tonight’s entertainment is proudly brought to you by yours truly! Please, no firearms. We're keeping things classy.”

The smoke swirled as a figure stepped into view: Fantomex, wearing his long white coat that was fluttering as if in a wind that didn’t exist, his twin silver pistols glinting.

“You…” Chaka muttered in anger before turning to his Tigers. “Kill him.”

Gunfire erupted. Bullets poured into the smoke. Fantomex moved like smoke himself, twisting, flipping, firing back with precision. Knocking Tigers off their feet one after another, his coat flashing in and out of the haze like a phantom on stage.

A large crate was brought down by an even larger Tiger, who opened the box and brought out a Gatling gun, lifting it up high and aiming it as Fantomex, ready to riddle him with bullets.

However, a large hand grabbed the muzzle and effortlessly crushed it like paper.

Luke Cage glared at the shocked Tiger and tapped him on the neck, knocking him out. He turned to a shocked but relieved Iron Fist. “Next time, give us the heads up if you're gonna raid a Triad fortress.”

“Will remember that,” Danny chuckled before his eyes caught Chaka running to the exit. “I am going after Chaka!”

“We'll deal with these punks!” Luke shouted, blocking a spray of bullets with his body.

Iron Fist nodded and sprinted after Chaka. Two Tigers blocked his way, and Danny spun and delivered a Twin Lotus Kick. Then, he tackled Chaka into the hallway.

Chaka kicked Iron Fist off him and kicked up, twirling his weapon. “You don't know when to quit, do you…”

“Don't know how.” Iron Fist took a stance once again.

Chaka’s San Jie Gun spun in a blinding arc. The sound was like a slicing wind, fast, sharp, deadly.

Iron Fist slipped sideways, letting the staff crack against the wall. Danny countered with the Leaping Crane Kick, foot snapping up, but Chaka folded the staff together, catching his leg in midair and hurling him into a wall.

Danny tried to get up, but Chaka kneed him in the face. However, Iron Fist refused to stay down. Letting out a frustrated snarl, Chaka wrapped the staff around Danny's throat, trying to choke the life out of him.

“Try to glow that fist of yours again…” Chaka mocked Danny's limitations. “It's over.”

Darkness crept in; his throat burned.

But then, his mind reminded him of Lei Kung’s lessons.

**“To be the Immortal Weapon, you must have no limits.”**

Danny’s Chi surged. Instead of pouring it into his fist, he spread it, letting it flood his whole body. His veins lit with golden fire.

With a roar, he seized the staff’s center and ripped the steel links, and it crumbled in his hands.

Chaka struck barehanded, but Danny moved faster now. A blur. Thousand Ant Strikes hammered his chest. Falling Leaf Kick sent him stumbling back. The golden glow covered Danny’s body, shimmering like an aura.

“What… are you?!”

The Immortal Iron Fist did not answer, but instead cut the distance between them with such speed that it looked like he teleported. Every strike blurred into dozens. When Chaka blocked one, ten more landed. He ended the exchange with a palm strike to the throat, causing Chaka to choke for air.

Iron Fist cocked his fist back, a familiar stance. He thrusted forward the Dragon Fist and the blow hammered into Chaka's chest, flinging him across the hall and hitting the floor.

As the dust settled, Danny Rand stood tall, waiting for Chaka to stand up, but he was out cold, signaling his win in this fight.

As his Chi died down, Danny felt pain shoot up his body. He felt like he had run a thousand miles without stopping; his wounds were screaming at him.

Before he fell, a hand caught him.

“It’s alright buddy, I got you.”

Luke Cage helped him up, putting Danny's arm over his shoulder. Together, they walked back to the main room, passing the knocked-out Golden Tigers.

“Victorious Dragon!” Fantomex cheered, seated cross-legged on a crate.

“I can guess you two now know each other?” Danny said through pained breaths. “Kinda wish it was under better circumstances.”

“Don’t worry, young Daniel,” said Fantomex. “I’ve had much more explosive first dates, trust me.” He got off the crate and checked on Danny’s wounds. “Well, nothing a nice Night Nurse can’t fix.”

“She’ll be really *happy* to see me bandaging up, *again*.” Danny noted.

“You’ll be fine, but this whole mess you dragged us into did give me the answer I needed.” Luke said then turned to Fantomex. “The reason why Danny asked you to meet me in the first place is that we have an offer for you. I wasn't exactly all in with the idea, but without you we wouldn’t have been able to find Iron Fist in time, and for that, you’ve earned my trust.”

“Why, I aim to impress.” Fantomex chuckled. “But what is the offer? Just so you know, I don’t take jobs anymore, but for you, I’ll make an exception and a discount.”

Luke sighed, half-smiling.

“You wanna join the Avengers?”

For once, Fantomex was taken aback, his confident veneer not present. Then a slow smirk spread behind his mask.

Overall 90-100 minutes we spent together talking. She said she got work after date and has to go but she also walked me to my car. I asked her if giving a ride would help her but she refused (I guess first date safety boundaries) which is okay.

I didn’t initiate holding hands or hug as I thought it’s going to be weird if I do it on first date.

She was very nice about paying her own bills but I paid as she doesn’t get paid for her volunteer work and I have a decent job (which I didn’t tell her how much I make as it would be seen as bragging)

I've thought about this since last night when the Peach Bowl failed but felt better thinking about the crowds SweetWater 420 and Terrapin will be served to in the 8 World Cup games coming to Atlanta.

* **What are the near term solid catalysts happening soon?**
* **What is realistic tailwinds that could nudge the share price north?**

No crystal ball here, but based on recent moves, earnings, and know USA & EU industry shifts, here's a brainstorm in no particular order—feel free to chime in or add your takes!

# 1. USA Schedule 3 Rescheduling: The Big Domino?

**Certainly the elephant in the room.**

Trump dropped that executive order on Dec 18, 2025, basically telling the DEA to bump cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3.

It's not full legalization, but it's a game-changer for medical access, research, and taxes. 

**Perfect for Tilray Medical USA, and Tilray wasted no time putting that up to expand MEDICAL CANNABIS into the USA.**

DEA's still calling it ""pending"" as of early Jan 2026, but Congress isn't blocking it, and the buzz is this could wrap up mid-to-late 2026 if things move smoothly (though some pessimistic takes say it could drag longer—up to years in worst-case bureaucracy).

**For Tilray, this opens doors wide:**

* **easier FDA approvals,**
* **interstate commerce potential,**
* **shot at federal medical markets.**

# Stock pop?

**Absolutely, especially if it's finalized before summer elections or something—could spark a rally like we saw post-order.**

# 2. Sch 3 and Medicaid for Seniors: Unlocking Boomer Demand

**""DEA's still in the expedited rulemaking phase as of early Jan 2026 (post-Trump's Dec 18 EO), with Congress not blocking it—buzz points to mid-to-late 2026 wrap-up if smooth (delays possible in bureaucracy). Tilray jumped on it fast, launching Tilray Medical USA on Dec 18, 2025, to ramp medical entry.""**

**Building on that, once Sch 3 hits, cannabis could qualify for Medicaid/Medicare coverage for seniors—think pain relief without opioids.**

**Tilray's got studies showing big wins in pain and sleep for older folks using their medical products.**

# Realistic timing?

**If rescheduling lands in 2026, we'd see pilot programs or approvals rolling out by late '26 or early '27.**

* **This isn't just fluff; it's a massive market for Tilray's oils and pharma-grade stuff.**
* **Could boost revenue 10-20% in medical segments alone, giving the stock a steady climb as adoption ramps.**
* **Add in their recent senior-focused study, and it's like they're prepping ahead of time for take off. Seniors enjoy Sinatra's 'Fly Me To The Moon'**

**NOTE: Check out what CWEB did — announced Dec 18 as part of a CMMI Medicare/Medicaid pilot for reimbursable CBD in senior oncology patients (up to \~$500/year potential coverage). Times that by millions of seniors? Massive tailwind if Sch 3 unlocks similar for THC medical. Stock price from $0.10 to over $0.50 in a few weeks.**

# 3. Sch 3 Clinical Trials: Fuel for Innovation

**Sch 3 makes trials way easier—no more jumping through Schedule 1 hoops.**

**Tilray's already a leader in medical research (their EU GMP cert is gold), so expect them to announce new U.S. trials for conditions like chronic pain or anxiety soon after rescheduling.**

# Timing: 

**Announcements could drop Q2-Q3 2026, with positive data readouts by year-end or 2027.**

# Positive trial news is rocket fuel for stocks.

* **Remember how pharma pops on phase results?**
* **Remember GW Pharma popped in 2018 $7.2 BILLION**
* **This could draw in institutional money and partnerships, pushing shares up 20-50% on hype cycles.**
* **Sch 3 and 280E Tax Relief: Cash Flow Bonanza**

Post-rescheduling, Tilray dumps that tax burden, freeing up millions in cash.  

Their Q2 '26 earnings already showed strong cash position (In 280E and extras: ""Q2 '26 showed strong cash (net cash \~$27-30M, $292M total cash/marketables)"", so this is like adding nitro.

# Timing: 

**Effective almost immediately upon final rule (maybe mid-2026), with retroactive relief possible. Analysts are eyeing this as a path to profitability; could juice EBITDA guidance and send the stock soaring 30%+ as margins fatten.**

# 5. Tilray Partnering with U.S. Pharma:

**Continuation of Italian 'Molteni Pharma' 2.0 Play**

**Tilray's Italy deal with Molteni Pharma for medical distribution was very smart, and a U.S. version could be huge.**

**With rescheduling, big pharma (think Pfizer or smaller players) might team up for co-branded meds or trials. Simon's been hinting at U.S. medical ramps, and they just launched Tilray Medical USA post-Trump order. Potential big unlock for medical cannabis expansion into the US, Aligning with Pharmaceuticals.**

# Likelihood?

* **High in 2026; watch for deals announced Q1-Q2 as regs clarify.**
* **This isn't pie-in-sky—it's leveraging their global expertise.**

# Stock impact:

**A major partnership could double shares overnight, like past M&A pops.**

# 6. VA Import News: Tilray's Low-Risk U.S. Entry Ticket

**The VA's been pushing for cannabis imports from Canada for vet studies/treatment, and Tilray's positioned perfectly with their medical lineup. Recent chatter says this could move fast—even before full Sch 3—since it's Schedule I insulated.**

**Tilray's not named yet, but their scale (45% Canadian market share) makes them a prime candidate.**

# Timing: 

**Updates or approvals possible Q1-Q2 2026; if they snag a chunk, it's steady revenue without full U.S. rec risks.**

# Bullish for stock: 

**Adds credibility and U.S. foothold, potentially lifting shares 15-25% on announcement.**

# 7. THC Drinks as the Federal Golden Ticket:

**Simon's Bold Call   Irwin Simon straight-up owns this narrative**

**- Tilray's bev infrastructure (45% Canadian THC bev market) makes them the leader for U.S. rollout.**

**- With rescheduling, full THC drinks could go federal sooner than rec flower.**

**- Their Q2 dip in overall bevs was from craft cuts (Project 420 savings on track), but alt/THC is exploding as no-hangover options.**

**- Just expanded Dry January with zero-proof spirits mimicking Breckenridge whiskeys—bridge to infused? Inevitable.**

# Timing: 

**Post-Sch 3 (late 2026?), with pilots in states sooner.**

# Stock tailwind: 

**This is the multi-billion vision Simon pitched in 2021; if feds greenlight, shares could 3x as they dominate. Nobody's stacked like this.**

# 8. Breckenridge Distillery:

# The Sleeper Hit for THC Adjacencies

# Breckenridge is the ace up the sleeve.

**- Simon's 2021 call to leverage it with SweetWater for THC plays is paying off, especially with Mock One zero-proofs as a teaser.**

**- Premium craft buzz without booze?**

**- In a shifting adult bev world, this screams growth.**

**- Q2 showed 26% bev revenue jump, and with U.S. regs easing, infused versions could launch 2026-2027.**

**- Adds serious multiple expansion to the stock as investors price in that ""multi-billion"" potential.**

# 9. Global Medical Cannabis Ramp: Europe on Fire

* **Simon name-dropped Poland and UK last week—Poland just greenlit their products for pharma distro, and UK's got Tilray's broadest flower portfolio.**
* **Spain and France are next with oils;**
* **France eyes full medical approval/rollout by early-mid 2026 (pilot ends March 31, 2026; reimbursement decisions wrapping Q1).**
* **Spain's decree wrapping up.**
* **Tilray's EU ops (Neumunster 3-5x'ed, Cantanhede doubled under that Broken Coast grower) mean production's cranked to 300+ tonnes annually from last year's 150. International cannabis up 36% in Q2, eyeing $150M run rate.**
* **Timing: More approvals Q1-Q3 2026;**
* **This offsets U.S. waits and could drive 20%+ revenue growth, steadying the stock through volatility.**

# A Few Extra Catalysts I Think Could Juice the Price Earnings Momentum:

# Q2 '26 crushed it ($218M rev, cash king)

* **if Q3 (early April) beats again, that's easy 10-20% pops.**
* **Reaffirmed '26 EBITDA $62-72M signals confidence.**
* **Hemp/THC Bev Synergies: With the Nov 2026 hemp ban looming, Tilray's pivot to regulated THC (via Breck/SweetWater) dodges that bullet and captures sober-curious trends.**
* **M&A or Buybacks:**

**Net cash position means they could scoop distressed assets or buy back shares post-reverse split—undervalued at current levels, per analysts.**

**Broader Industry Tailwinds: Virginia retail market by Nov '26, plus EU reforms, could spill over to Tilray's exports.**

# Overall, 2026 feels like Tilray's breakout year if Sch 3 sticks the landing.

# International growth as the steady engine, U.S. medical as the turbo.

# Shares are undervalued IMO, especially after that earnings surge.

It's been a week since i found out about limerence after reading the word on a forum i've been following. I've spent some time reading the many posts on this subreddit and i'm grateful for all people sharing their stories if only to reassure me i'm not alone in this mess - thank you all for this openness. 

I'm writing this post mainly for a bit of catharsis. Total anonimity will allow me to spill my most private thoughts, including things i've been to ashamed to tell my therapist.

  It's bound to be long to provide context, evolution and repeating patterns. I'm marking the culmination further down for those interested by the topic title who want to skip to this part. 

-start testimony - 

I don't remember too much of my youth other than having a warm family home, and a rather uneventful adolescence. 

Real friendships were uncommon. I wanted to hang with the cool kids who tolerated me, but i never belonged. Being in school away from my home village made that outside of school i didn't have any friends/acquaintances. I had real trouble connecting with girls and the few feeble efforts i did were unsuccessful. I had few crushes on girls i didnt know at all and only saw from a distance, pedestalized them and completely froze when initiating contact - a recipe for disaster with exactly those results. 

I remember passing the girl i had been obsessing about for months a little note to ask whether she'd want go go out for drinks. She gave me a note the next morning which ended with ""if you change the way you handle interacting to girls you might have more succes"" - which destroyed the smidgen of confidence i had tried to accumulate to finally approach her. 
 

At 17 there was small breakthrough - if i distill the positive. I agreed to go to a club wth some friends. Something i hadn't done earlier.  In the club i had no idea what i was doing. Very self-conscious about my inability to dance and trying to have fun even though in reality i didnt like being there.  But then i saw her, the modt gorgeous girl i'd seen in the last years, a waitress of my age. 
Finding all confidence i had, i decided to go chat and ended up getting her number. We texted the next day and met up for a drink soon after. This went surprisingly well considering how i was stunned by her beauty and coulnd not stop thinking about her before. 
After the date we texted in the next days until my pedestalization went completely in overdrive and had sent things to her that drove her to break all contact immediately. I don't remember what is was, but it mustve come across as hyperidolization comong across as creepy. 

At 18 my first sexual interaction was with a prostitute, yet i remained a virgin technically. 


University was a new start with new opportunities to build a new social network. The degree i was working towards was populated with 95% men which limited easy ways to make contact. I spent most of my time playing video games online with complete strangers as well as chatting on irc, rather than real life socializing. 
Again, a repeating pattern in the behaviour to girls : smitten by a  passer-by which i idolized without initiating contact up to a certain moment, after which my emotions didn't allow to come across as a potential partner. Interactions were few with 100% failure rate.

At 21 i was still a virgin, and decided that i didn't want to wait anymore. I lost my virginity to a prostitute in a brothel, and in the months after kept doing so. 
I was happy with the services rendered and it gave me some sort of joy. Until i met her : a new girl started working there, she wasn't much older than me, and i my world stopped. She was nice to me and i felt a (albeit fake) connection. I visited her nearly weekly and spent all the money i had from a side job when studying judt to be with her. It evolved from lust to longing for closeness and hugs and when i wasnt with her i was emotionally broken : continously reminiscing and making scenarios in my head what to say and trying to get her to feel something for me so we could be together, without paying and having her like me for me. 

After a few months i went to visit her in the brothel and her colleagues told me she wasn't in, even though i felt, and swore she was hiding out of sight. I felt horrible and spent the next weeks emotionally empty. I stopped seeing prostitutes. 

For reasons i can't pinpoint, around age 23-24 things shifted a bit. I was able to ditch some insecurities. 
There were some social situations in which i went out of my comfort zone and try and socialize with girls i didn't find overly attractive to ""build some skills"".  Interactions were brief, transactional, and in retrospect how ""normal"" people interact with girls they dont want to pursue. 
I registered to a dating site and landed two dates. 

The first  girl was very pretty, and i ruined our coffee date by pedestalizing her from the first second, and her ending contact with me soon after our date was done. 
The other girl i had never seen. We both had profiles without pictures, and we had nothing real in common other than respect to one another and some less standard interests - the quirkiness made us match. We had 3 of the craziest dates, i had unpaid sex for the very first time and it was good fun. The biggest difference was my confidence and the lack of idolization. I found her fun to be around but lust overtook physical attraction, and the feeling of acceptance - being liked for me. We ended seeing one another after 2 months because my lack of romantic interest made me uninterested, egoistical and she didn't put up with her. Regardless, it was just fun and never anything bordering on serious, not from my end. 

I took on  a hobby where i came into contact with my, now, s.o. 
I didnt notice her specifically, and treated her as one of the guys. I had no romantic interest from the start. She wasn't pushy and did give some signs which i failed to capture. It felt like a boy-girl friendship and buddies sharing a hobby. She had a good social life and made me part of it. At a point in time she kissed me which made her intentions clear and few weeks later we went to be more than friends.  I had not idolized her as any other infatuation i had had in the years before and hence did not love bomb her or go into my standard way of obsessing, preparing conversations mentally and seeing her as the dream woman out of my league. 

Fast-forward 15 years where we are married with two sons and all external features of a happy and successful couple. 

(----enter limerence----) 

Even though i was never in love with her we had a good life and i liked being around her. We gave one another security, financially and emotionally and i did not feel missing out on anything. 

Until on a certain day i was introduced to a new colleague. She was working in another country 1000's of kilometers away but would visit my office. I'd.heard about her impressive career but had never met her. 
Over mail we decided to get coffee and discus client pitch. When the i entered the meeting room i was nailed to the floor : she was tall, had such grace and style.and while not my idea of pure beauty which i had idolized in the past, her smile, energy and elegance made her a solid 9/10.

We talked strategy. She was an expert in a topic new for me and her explaining it to me with a gentleness and friendliness i had never experienced made me fall back into idolization mode. Our meeting ended, we spoke to the client and she went back to her country, far away. 

I couldnt stop thinking about her. How she looked, how she spoke to me and how she had gifted me with her attention. 
After a while the distance and no immediate need to collaborate made we didn't have contact anymore and the urge faded. 
Some months passed  we now had more opportunities to collaborate professionally. I was happy every time we spoke but infatuation didnt really play. I loved her insight, business acumen and her willing to coach me professionally. 
We met once physically aw part of a team event and she was a bit distant and not giving me the attention i craved for. I rationized it: she had some career challenges which needed her focus. Afterwards we kept talking on zoom and i felt like her friend, enjoying our little time together intensely even if over a period of 2.years we had not more than combined 4 hours of real 1:1 time. 

At a given time i get a message she's leaving the company - no collaboration was going to happen and she'd disappear... a wave of darkness came over me. Something dawned upon me: these feelings were much more than what i had identified them. I felt an intense urge to come clean and organized a meeting with her to talk business with the pretense to confess my feelings. 
She was happily married, with kids, and was moving away. It felt safe to tell her. Inside i knew the feelings were not reciprocal. I recorded our 2 hour long zoom conversation without her knowing to have a memento. 

When i confessed she handled it with majestic grace, in a way she could only do. I felt emotionally lighter - for a bit. Which is when the problems started. 

Up to then these feelings, which i hadnt felt over the last 15 years, had not impacted life at home. But it changed drastically. Over the next months i became a shadow of myself without any joy, and completely emotionally unavailable to my wife and my boys. They noticed but cut me some slack. i blamed work and excessive stress draining me and they went with it.  
I was obsessed and idolizing her, replaying conversations in my head, and watching the zoom recording which failed by not having recorded the sound and making me lipread to find the moment i confessed. I kept looking for signs that might prove some feelings, duchenne markers when she smiled and overanalyzed every single word, motion, and gesture. 

It impacted my work, and home situation as every drop of mental energy was drained into this. 

6 months later i looked for help and found a therapist. I chose a woman deliberately, hoping for and.needing a. woman's vision on this. 
My emotional stress bucket was filled over the brim and  dumping my secret and feelings on someone truly objective enabled an enormous release. I had previously emotionally stonewalled everyone, so this was a double win: i was able to discharge these compressed feelings and was finally ready to open up and hope for healing. 

Even though some progress was made, i was never the person i had been in the previous decade. My life had turned around 180 degrees. Professional confidence and a good life had traded places with the same lack of confidence and low self-esteem as during adolescence and every single decision made was.driven by fear

6 months later my therapist closed her practice and i was left directionless. I felt betrayed. Luckily i saw my need.for emotional guidance and found another therapist after a month where i needed to start over again, telling my story or at least parts i wanted to discuss and which are less elaborate than my story written here. 

Little by little my obsession faded, partly by absence of interaction with my LO, partly overshadowed by the collateral damage it caused risking to lose my job. 

During my confession to my LO we had agreed to keep contact, as friends. At the start, when an odd message came from here, I relapsed. She found me important enough to exchange 2-3.messages of pleasantried and that was all it took. Luckily this has now, 2 years later, lost it's effect. 


Regardless, therapy and some sort of closure aside, i had a major emotional sinkhole which had formed: i had felt such strong emotions for another women who was unavailable and without reciprocal feelings. I loved my wife but had never been in love with her - or at least what my perception of in love was : idolization, pedestalization and blind admiration. 
I felt having missed out on passion throughout the years and fell back into old habits: prostitution. 

In thr meantime i have visited girls an average of once every second month, with frequency increasing steadily over the last 3.months.

I have told my therapist, overcoming great shame. Yet, i keep relapsing, feeling a deep need to continue doing this to fill an unidentified emotional gap. 

Few weeks ago the worst possible situation presented itself. I planned a session with a girl i had never seen and she proved to be the most beautiful girl i have ever seen. Our sincle time together has given me the most intense high i have felt over the last decade, and of my sad life, and was by far the event that has given me such complete satisfaction during the hour we spent. 
I was completely flabbergasted by her beauty and could not act normal but rather an even more extreme version of infatuation in hyper condensed form.
 Due to her professionalism she gave me the experience i yearned for and for which my brain was wired to believe this was what i wanted the result of my idolization wanted and.expected to be. 

After the sex we had a small talk where her story triggered the last straw. She was not only the world's prettiest but had a mission in life and was highly intelligent.  I see this now as anima projection of the purest form. 

When closing the door my obsession started again. It felt Familiar : continuous yearning hoping there's a figment of hope she could feel something for me. Looking at the pictures of her on the brothel's website. 
And all this time, again, neglecting work and family, my wife being emotionally kept far away while trying to keep the boys closer. 

I'm ready to blow up everything i've worked for and built up over 2 decades to be with her, while she probably doesn't even remember me except maybe for being an ecstatic creep.

Yet, at the same time i am getting deeper and deeper in the emotional abyss because even in the astronomically small chance she might be open to take any step of connecting outside the services she offers,.there is no way i have something to offer: emotionally unstable and burnt out, 10-15 years older and idolization based on projection of my unmet needs are a cesspool of a foundation to build any sort of relationship. 

Which leaves me in a state of spiraling despair,.a new LO,. and even suicidal ponderings as the cleanest solution for myself and to give my family a chance to restart and be happy. This latter is being discussed with my therapist to avoid any final decisions 


***

If you've made it this far through my ramblings in probably poor english, which ive written in a stream  consciousness over the last 3 hours, and not reread for typo's or grammar, then i hope it can mean something for you, just as much as it meant for me to confess, and dump  by writing it down. 

Thank you again for being part, and giving shape and body to a community of people suffering from this horrible condition

1q994cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q994cv/aitah_for_expressing_my_concerns_about_her_new/,AITAH for expressing my concerns about her new partner,"Hi my 31M best friend MJ 30F starting dating a guy (Rob) that I am starting to have major concerns about. 

Rob and MJ had known for each other for about 2 years and during that entire time, Rob pined after her. It was very clearly to everyone else in her life that they weren’t actually friends, that Rob had different ideas. Rob moved away to another state like 14 hours away for his merchant mariner that has him away months at a time. Rob would constantly sent her coffee, flowers, gifts, etc. through DoorDash. This paired with his intense language definitely had me thinking lovebombing. 

While MJ loved the attention, she was pretty adamant not wanting to do long distance with a man who’s gone months at a time and one that is constantly up her butt when they’re not together. In comes Jeff, he’s a relatively nice guy. A few years younger than MJ, inexperienced having never been in a relationship, but has a good amount of common with MJ. MJ and Jeff decide to date and they continue to do so for 6 months. During this relationship, Rob is still sending gifts, still trying to woo her. I asked MJ why he is still doing this and she says that Jeff doesn’t mind and isn’t jealous. I’m of the opinion that even if your partner doesn’t care, you shouldn’t be accepting constant gifts from another man, which I told her. 

Fast forward 6 months, MJ has lost her job, she breaks up with Jeff for being super unsupportive, hot and cold, etc. MJ is a super low point in her life, I’ve never seen her so depressed. And then, Rob re-enters the fold and the love bombing commences. Constant flowers in the mail, coffee to her house, and gifts. Over the holidays she was near his area and he convinced her to let him drive her 14 hours back to where she lived. They stopped along some areas to have fun and she sent me pictures of them. Where she’s wearing a neckless I had never seen before. 

Quick tangent on these photos: When I tell you this man looks dead in the eyes of all the photos. He doesn’t look happy. He doesn’t look like a man that finally got the woman he’s been pining after. He doesn’t look in love. 

Anyways, we get to talking and she is talking about how this man is her husband, how she’s so happy, how no one has ever treated her like this before. I ask her about the necklace and she said he purchased it in Tanzania on his work trip after she ended things with him originally because he knew he’d “win her back.” Which is what he was trying to do with all those gifts while dating Jeff. When I told her that was concerning, she said he just knew what he wanted. 

Now I have alarm bells going off because it’s very clear this man had no respect for her boundaries and thinks he knows what she wants better than she does. When she was in a healthy headspace, she was very adamant about not wanting to build a life with a man who had to live where he is currently and is gone minimum 3 months at a time. Now all of a sudden when she has lost a lot, all of that has gone out the window. I’m very skeptical of his behavior and where she’s at mentally, but I hold my tongue. Until a few days pass and she sends me yet another bouquet of flowers that he sent her. So I sent her an audio message laying out my concerns. I told her that I don’t think she’s in a place where she shouldn’t be making long term plans with someone given this is the opposite of what she’s always said she wanted. I told her that it’s a major red flag that he completed disregarded her choice and kept pursing her even after she was in a relationship. That his behavior is very symptomatic of a loverbomber. I asked her if she likes the way he makes her and the things he does for her rather than actually liking him. She had never talked about his qualities that she liked, just the gifts and things he did for her. I told her that I was worried about her. I told her that she has every right to be mad at me for this message but it’s coming from a place of love  and concern. 

I never heard anything back, which I’m taking as she didn’t like what I had to say. 

So AITAH for telling my friend my concerns? Am I wrong for thinking these things are concerning in the first place?

Also just to be clear because I know this a question that’s gonna come up. No, my relationship with MJ has always been platonic and no feelings of jealousy exist. I am in a healthy relationship of my own

I still remember her eyes, in them were all my tomorrows. There was peace, love, happiness and a kindness I hadn’t seen up to that point in life, a gentleness only rivaled by the sheer beauty contained within that amber haze of her iris. I still remember her smile, her love and I’ll never forget her pain. I was young then but I didn’t believe it at the time, I had always considered myself to be an old soul of sorts, as if I was older than my actual years allowed. I had lived in a small town in rural America, not small enough for everyone to know everyone but still small nonetheless, my life was rather unremarkable there and I always found myself wishing to escape from the monotony of the place. To do that I’d require money of course so I found work as a carpenter, the pay was never good but there was a certain satisfaction with the work that money couldn’t buy, but I made enough to live, go out with friends and generally enjoy the freedom of youth. Those days now seem all to run together, wake up late, work poorly and promise myself I’d do better the next day only to stay up late with friends and find myself in the same way again. We had a small classic diner in town, we ate breakfast there pretty often but never really lunch or dinner, I can still smell the burgers and fries and I can still taste the eggs, hashbrowns and coffee. 
“What’ll you get?” asked Bobby peering at me over his glasses 
“Probably the same thing I always get” I replied still looking over the menu which I knew like the back of my hand. 
“Supposed to be a rainy day today, hope you brought coats” announced Steven.
“You know I brought mine boss, I always come prepared unlike dear Johnathan here” 
I ignored his comment, Bobby was a good guy but the only way he knew to show any sort of affection was teasing, if you didn’t know him you’d think him an arrogant ass. 
We sat together there for a while discussing the days events, what jobs we had lined up and how we’d complete them, Bobby teased me for how drunk I was the night before, I had barely begun to drink I told him. We had ate there many times, and were known by all the regular employees, most of them sweet old women just trying to make some extra spending money for themselves but today was different. One fact of life I’ve learned over my years is that big life changing events are never expected, it always happens on a usual Wednesday at work or a waking phone call in the middle of the night, the most pivotal moments in my life always came suddenly upon me and I was never the same after. 
“Its about time you got here, where have you been?” Asked the older woman whom I recognized as some sort of manager.
“Traffic was bad, I’m sorry” replied the girl who’d just walked in, I smiled because I knew there was no way traffic was bad this early in the morning. 
“What’re you smiling about?” Bobby said 
“Nothing, I just admire the courage to lie so openly”
“Well I’d hope you don’t lie at all, especially when it comes to why you’re always so late”  said Steven still looking at his paper and sipping his coffee. 
“Abe Lincoln would be jealous of Johnathans honesty boss” replied Bobby with his signature dumb smile,  I was still trying to listen to the conversation between the girl and her boss.
“You’ve made enough excuses, this is the third time this week” 
“I know, I’m sorry. I’ll do better” the girl said putting her head down in shame, it was a move I recognized from my own repertoire. I’d used it many times on Steven after me and Bobbys drunken adventures put me late into work and so I knew what would come next. As soon as the boss turned and walked away all shame and remorse disappeared from the girls eyes and body, her head straightened and her hair fell smoothly down her back again, about halfway down or so. She went to the back to get ready for her day.
“We’ve gotta finish the drywall work at the house on fifth, I wanted to get the shingles done on the yellow house on third but this rain killed that idea”
“We could always make Johnathan do it, worst case he falls and we have to hire someone who’ll actually show up on time” 
“I don’t know how you do it” I replied, “we drink the same and yet I can’t drag myself out of bed and you’re up early” 
“I’m simply just a stronger man, look at these” he flexed his biceps. 
“Doesn’t matter how early we’re up if we sit all day in this diner waiting on food” I said looking around wondering where my sausage biscuit could possibly be. I was hungry. 
“Burger with fries?” Here! Called Bobby “Who eats a burger for breakfast?” I asked. 
“A stronger man than you” he taunted back. The girl smiled to herself and slightly giggled, she didn’t want me to notice.
“Eggs, waffles and toast?”
 “Right here”, Steven said. “And when you can, some more coffee please”
“Of course, I’ll bring it right out, and a sausage biscuit with toast and bacon for you” She looked at me and I felt paralyzed, it took all my presence of mind to muster a simple “Thank you” 
“You’re welcome” she said as she walked to get the coffee. 
There was just something about her, she wasn’t necessarily the prettiest girl I’d ever seen but her deep brown eyes hidden under her loosely collected hair held a secret which i wished to know, her smiling face failed to conceal the painful life which she lived and I knew or at least suspected at that moment I’d have to get to know her more. My mind went to my love life, if there even was one. I was always a quiet shy person especially in school, sure I had talked to a few girls and I wasn’t a virgin but nothing true ever came from it. And at one point I think I decided to simply give up.
“Here’s that coffee” 
“Thanks” 
I watched her walk away, I had caught a glimpse of her name tag, something with E but she moved too quick, I looked at her ring finger also, not wanting to try and deprive some other fool of his woman.
“She’s new” I said as nonchalantly as I could as to not arouse Bobbys jokes.
“She’s slow, coffee should not take that long”
“Take it easy on Johnny boys new girlfriend boss, did you see the way he choked when she gave his food!” 
“Shut-up. Who is she anyway?”
“Hah I saw you checking her out as she left” 
“Maybe” I replied, stuffing my face with biscuit. “What would be so wrong with it if I did?” 
“Nothing at all, I’d just be happy for you to actually speak to a woman for once, instead of just glare”
“We can’t all be ladies men like you I guess” 
“There’s no one as cool as me” he replied.
We ate quickly and left to do our jobs for the day, every time she stepped out from the back I watched her, she had a few tables, for the most part she did a good job. I noticed her look our way a few times and she came by to check on us once or twice but I was sure she was just doing her job and not at all interested in me. The day was over before I knew it, it was a Friday so me and Bobby got our checks and walked to our vehicles.
“Bar hop tonight? I need to let off some steam” 
“Nah I think ill pass tonight, I need a night in to catch up on housework and some sleep if I’m lucky”
“Suit yourself, I’ll see you Monday.”
“See you”
I walked into my home, it was slightly cold so I turned on the electric heater and kicked my shoes off, I was tired and ready for the relaxation only home could provide. A while later I took a shower and opened a beer, not planning on going too far of course. But there was still the problem of dinner, I had neglected to get grocery’s through the week. The phone rang.
“Hello?”
“Johnathan, how are you?” It was my father, we’d never been too close but still called each other somewhat often.
“Doing good here, busy day at work today.
“Thats good, better it be busy than having nothing to do”
We continued talking for abut a half an hour or so but eventually we both decided to hang up and go back to our separate lives. I was still hungry, a thought crossed my mind “I could go to the diner for some food” a burger sounded great. Of course in the back of my mind I wondered if she’d be there still, I figured not because it was so late but I got some clothes on and made my way to the diner. 



 It occurred to me on my way there I had never eaten there alone, always with friends. But I suppose the pursuit of love will make us do things we never even considered. I walk through the door and it’s somewhat busy, a few locals we had done a job for and some truck drivers simply passing through. I took a seat.
“Hey you!” It was her, I hadn’t seen her when I walked in and she took me by surprise. 
“Once wasn’t enough, you had to come back for more huh? Where’s your friends?” 
“They’re my co-workers, I feel sorry for anyone who calls Bobby friend” I said feeling stupid as soon as I spoke.
“Awww he can’t be that bad. What can I get you to drink?” 
“I’ll take a Coke please”
“Alright, I’ll be right back with that and a menu.”
I sat there thinking, her name was Evelyn, I had got to look at her name tag. Her eyes had a look I knew all too well, a look I had seen countless times on my own face in the mirror, a look of dissatisfaction with life and the feeling of wasting the gift of youth. 
“Here’s that drink and a menu”
“I already know what I want”
“Oh ok, what can I get for you?”
“A cheeseburger, hold the onions and pickle please.”
“No onion?! Who doesn’t get onion on their burger?” She said smiling at me.
“I guess me?” I said, feeling awkward and knowing my face was turning red.
“Well ok, I’ll get this in for you, shouldn’t be long”

it has been over a year since i started being serious about coffee. i've seen a lot of videos saying that a WDT, leveling tool, and tamper are important in making a great shot of espresso. my current shots are okay but they're not really consistent. my coffee beans are fresh; i buy beans that were roasted a week before. i'm using the built-in grinder to grind my beans (i know that the built-in grinder isn't the best but i'd like to stick with it for now).

anyway, i was wondering:

\- what tools are worth getting if i have a breville barista express impress? i'm planning to get the whole set of breville's craft collection.

\- would buying a stand alone tamper work better given that the barista express impress already has a built in tamper?

\- is it necessary to have a leveling tool and a WDT?

i'm also considering brands like normcore but shipping to my country is expensive. there's a nearby breville warehouse near me, so i'd rather buy from them to save money and time 😅.

dose: 18g

shot time: \~30 seconds (8 seconds pre infusion)

yield: 36-40g, mostly around 40g though

Adult brother’s abuse is ruining my mental health, but I can’t leave","I chose to post this here because I genuinely need to know if what I’m feeling is valid, I’ve spent too long being conditioned to think it’s okay to live like this.

I (21F) live with my parents and my older brother (27M). We are a Muslim Arab family, and cultural context matters a lot here.

Overall, my parents treat me well. They support my education, help me financially, and are there for me when I need them. My father, in particular, agrees with me that my brother’s behavior is not acceptable. However, he has serious anger issues himself, and when he intervenes, situations can escalate badly — we’ve experienced this in the past. Because of that, he often does nothing out of fear that things could turn violent.

My mother’s priority is very simple: as long as my brother comes home every night and is alive, she is satisfied. She is terrified that if she pushes him too hard, he will end up homeless or dead.

I am a master’s student in a very demanding program. I work and have some income, but it is absolutely not enough to afford my own place, and working more would seriously harm my studies. I help at home when I can, depending on my energy and mental state, and I always do everything my mother explicitly asks me to do, and she doesn’t ask me for a lot since I am mostly very busy.

Leaving my parents’ home right now would mean losing financial stability, emotional support, and possibly my future. I truly have too much to lose, and my brother is not worth that sacrifice.

My brother has a long history of addiction and severe anger issues. His behavior is partly due to that, but also very clearly linked to a deeply patriarchal mindset. He grew up learning that as a man, very little is expected of him, that household responsibilities are not his job, and that he is implicitly superior to me as a woman.

He has never done a single household chore in his 27 years of life, and this has always been tolerated.

Despite this, my mother constantly asks me to help him, especially with administrative things: writing emails, looking for jobs for him, handling paperwork, etc. Growing up, he was always difficult, made bad choices, had addictions, and had explosive conflicts with my father. My other brothers has even completely cut contact with him because of how unbearable he is.

My mother no longer expects anything from him in general — but she expects a lot from me. Because I learned to prioritize myself in this family, she often demonizes me instead.

She regularly accuses me of “never doing anything at home,” even though I help when I can and always do what she asks. She also frequently criticizes my personality and character. Importantly: she does not confront my brother like this. The reproaches are directed at me, not at him, because she expects nothing from him anymore.

My brother bullied me throughout my childhood and adolescence. It was mostly subtle but constant psychological pressure and comments body shaming me. My parents never did a thing, they simply told me to ignore him, so I learned to emotionally dissociate and deny everything. Over time, he realized he couldn’t reach me anymore and stopped.

As adults, our relationship became “livable” only because it was minimal. We barely spoke, only basic practical interactions, nothing more. But because of the bullying, I physically feel tense when he is near my and his mere presence makes me angry in general.

About a month ago, everything exploded. He decided to take all his anger out on me. He screamed at me, insulted me, threatened me, and I, due to extreme accumulated stress (exams, work, exhaustion) at that moment, finally reacted for the first time in my life. I snapped, I screamed back. My father had to physically separate us because my brother pushed me and I grabbed the first thing I saw near my and was ready to fight him. 

I was in severe emotional distress afterward, but instead of receiving support, I was reproached by my mother. According to her, I was right in principle since he was the one yelling at me, physically threatening me, and insulting me — but I shouldn’t have reacted. And if things had ended badly when my father separated us, it would have been my fault. That moment deeply broke something in me.

Since then, we have not spoken at all. I made the conscious decision to officially cut all contact with him. It has now been a month, and this is the first time I’ve struggled this much to recover from a family conflict. My physical tension when he is near me has only worsened since then.

My parents tried to convince me to go back on that decision using religious arguments, telling me it’s haram to cut family ties and implying that my prayers would not be accepted. This caused a huge internal moral and spiritual conflict for me. But that is not true, because even though family ties are very important in my religion, this applies to genuine, healthy relationships—not to toxic ones that harm my peace or even threaten my safety.

This morning, for the first time since the big fight, I suddenly heard his voice again. He screamed at me because I walked toward the coffee machine after he had turned it on first. I hadn’t even noticed his presence—I barely had time to realize the machine was on before he started yelling at me.

Instantly, my body reacted. I had a full panic attack: racing heart, shaking, crying, inability to breathe properly. I immediately ran up to my room, and while I was in crisis, I could hear him telling my mother that I always did this—that whenever he prepared to make coffee, I always got to it first, and that next time I did it, he would hit me. None of this was true. My mother, who usually tries to calm him during his outbursts, started telling him that I was indeed in the wrong and that she was fed up with both of us. At this point, I don’t even know if she truly believes it, but I have doubts.

The last time, after the big fight, I also heard my brother retell the entire story to her, claiming that I was the one who shouted first and hit first. After that, my mother came to give me a lecture, telling me it was true that I had caused the fight—even though she had literally been there and witnessed what happened. It frustrates me so much—this gaslighting from him is one thing, but from my mother too?

That’s when I realized something important: the accumulation of all these years I had accepted, normalized, and learned to live with is now physically affecting me. I no longer have the strength to keep doing this.

Part of the reason this could go on for so many years is that he never really hit me. Even during the fight, he only pushed me, and though he harassed me and body-shamed me throughout my life, his insults never crossed a certain line.

Now were am I now : 

	•	I can’t realistically leave without destroying my future.

	•	My parents won’t take real action against him.

	•	The situation is technically “livable” because we don’t interact — but my body is no longer okay.

	•	I feel trapped between self-preservation and losing everything else.

I don’t want revenge. I don’t want chaos.

I just want peace, safety, and acknowledgment that this situation is not normal.

Any perspective, validation, or advice would mean a lot. I feel very alone.

Cutting the cord in 2026 shouldn't mean sacrificing quality. After testing over 20 providers specifically for **North American and British expats**, I found one service that actually delivers on its promises of stability and 4K quality: **[ErsatzTV](https://ersatztv.com)**.

If you are tired of your stream freezing during the **Super Bowl**, **Premier League** matches, or **NHL playoffs**, this is the upgrade you need.

## Why 90% of IPTV Services Fail in US/UK/CA

Most ""cheap"" IPTV links oversell their servers. The result?
* **Buffering** during high-traffic events (NFL Sundays / Saturday 3 PM Kickoffs).
* **Missing EPG** (TV Guide) for local time zones.
* **Geo-blocks** preventing access to UK/US content from abroad.

## The Solution: ErsatzTV (2026 Update)

**[ErsatzTV](https://ersatztv.com)** has optimized its routing specifically for English-speaking markets. Here is why it is currently the #1 recommendation:

### 🇺🇸 USA: All Major Networks & Sports
* **Live Sports:** NFL Sunday Ticket, NBA League Pass, MLB, and UFC PPV events in FHD/4K.
* **Premium Channels:** HBO, Showtime, Starz, and full cable packages.
* **Local News:** Access to ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX affiliates from major US cities.

### 🇬🇧 UK: Premier League & Entertainment
* **Football:** Full coverage of **Premier League** (including 3 PM kickoffs), Championship, and Champions League via TNT Sports & Sky Sports.
* **Entertainment:** BBC iPlayer channels, ITV, Channel 4, and Sky Movies.
* **No VPN Needed:** Works directly without complicated setups.

### 🇨🇦 Canada: Hockey & Regional TV
* **Hockey Night:** Reliable streams for all **NHL** games (Sportsnet & TSN).
* **French/English:** Complete coverage for CBC, CTV, and TVA Sports.
* **Local Channels:** News and weather from Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal.

## Next-Gen Features for 2026

* **⚡ Anti-Freeze Technology:** Proprietary load balancing to stop buffering before it starts.
* **📺 4K HEVC Streaming:** Crystal clear picture quality optimized for large Smart TVs.
* **📱 Multi-Device Support:** Works flawlessly on **Firestick 4K**, NVIDIA Shield, Apple TV, Android, and iOS.
* **📅 Accurate EPG:** 7-day program guide so you never miss a show.

## Verdict: Is It Worth It?

For the price of a coffee, you get access to virtually every channel in the US, UK, and Canada. Stability is king in the IPTV world, and **ErsatzTV** is currently wearing the crown.

### How to Start Watching Instantly

I woke up in the middle of our big twin bed with my wife on the left side and her friend (F) completely naked on my right side. Her friend lives in another country and she visits us few times a year (she has family and relatives in our country, different city). She spent Christmas and new year with her family in her hometown and came yesterday (Friday) to our place. Last evening, after kids went to bed, we stayed awake pretty late, girls were drinking and I only took one glass of wine (not big fan of getting drunk in recent years) and me and wife smoked a joint before going to sleep. When we called it a night, wife and me went to our room and her friend was supposed to sleep in living room (there is quite spacey sofa bed enough for more than two person to sleep comfortably). It was quite late when we went to bed and we fell asleep almost instantly. When we were together last night, nothing was strange, some small talk, watched a movie, listened to music, just regular time together.

I woke up 30 minutes ago and I was feeling there is no space in bed. First taught was that our youngest daughter woke up during the night and come to our bed (she still does that sometimes when she has a bad dream). To my shock it was not our kid, but my wife's friend. And fully naked! I sneaked from the bed, went to bathroom and now I am in the kitchen having a coffee and cigarette and trying to get things sorted in my head.

Both my wife and me are in our underwear, as we usually sleep that way. I checked my underwear and nothing strange on it. As I mentioned, me and wife didn't have sex last night as she was quite drunk last night and we just crushed to bed. No any other signs that anything sexual happened during the night and I am 100 % sure I didn't touch her friend.

Now I am in the kitchen waiting for both of them to wake up and I am anxious to see what will each of them say and react.

I would like to hear opinion from other people and what do you think that really happened and how should I react when they wake up.

1q98zxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Friendzone/comments/1q98zxv/was_the_behavior_of_this_colleague_and_her/,Was the behavior of this colleague and her husband normal?,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

Rain fell in sheets, dancing on the skylight. Evelyn lounged in her recliner by the radiator, cooling mug of jasmine tea on the windowsill, laptop open, watching her ex’s location moving on the computer screen. Lightning flashed. Wind howled. The hurricane was furious outside, and DJ really shouldn’t be driving in this storm!

Evelyn fumed from her recliner. That fucking bastard was gonna kill himself, and then where would she be? A single mom, three kids, income dwindling from her last book deal. She'd have to go back to work. In an office. Or, worse, a Waffle House. Not that there was anything wrong with Waffle House. She'd been sitting in a booth one evening—she liked to think that 3 AM was still evening, thank you—when police had stormed in, arrested the cook (who made the best hash browns all the way!), and led him away. Her second book, the New York Times Bestseller How Horses Mate, was written at a Waffle House. She liked their food, the bland coffee.

No, it didn't have anything to do with the two men who'd sat behind her talking about their jobs as horse semen collectors (totally legitimate, by the way), nor the fact that they had shared a bedroom at the hotel on this trip, nor that they were so obviously in love but wouldn't do anything about it beyond trysts while they collected samples for breeding. Yes, she thought that sentence in her head exactly that way because it did sound vulgar and yet charming.

""Damn it! Stop getting distracted."" Eyes returned to the screen, the chain keeping them secured around her neck swaying from the movement. The dot on the computer screen had made a left, towards the eye of the storm. Then stopped. Reversed. Went back the way it had come.

Evelyn pulled the screen closer to her. DJ was retracing the path he had just taken, but doing it backwards. Her eyes glanced at the clock on the screen. She loved this one. It was one of those live backgrounds, maybe AI-created, but it was a grandfather clock that reminded her of the one she'd seen as a kid in her great-grandmother's home. It was moving backwards, too.

That was weird. Well, not really. That only ever happened when she was writing and deleting sentences. Time had this way of syncing up with her brain. One time, she had taken a paragraph from one file, pasted it in a separate one, rewrote it, and then returned it to the first file. When that was done, she'd noticed the clock in the background looked different as well, like someone had redone the code when she wasn't looking.

The dot stopped. Evelyn blinked. The dot made a right turn. That was new. She checked the clock. Time was running forward again. Perfect. Her fingers gripped the screen tightly as the dot moved again, frantically. Through a building? What the hell?

Her hands found the mug of tea on the windowsill, still steaming. She sipped the hot tea, basking in the flavors of ginger and lemon that danced on her tongue. The dot on the screen, her ex's phone, was meandering through the city. In the middle of a storm. He was going to get himself killed! Then where would she be? A single mom, two kids, income dwindling from her last book deal. She'd gonna have to pick up shifts at the Waffle House again! Not that there was anything wrong with Waffle House. She'd been sitting in a booth one morning—she liked to think that 1 PM was still morning, thank you—when police had stormed in, arrested the server (the very friendly young lady who was missing her bottom teeth), and led her away. Her second book, the New York Times Bestseller Butterflies on the Wind, was written at a Waffle House. She liked their food, the bland coffee.

And yes, she had written about butterflies because they'd been dancing the flowers outside the window. The springtime sun had been out and smiling. The Taco Bell drive-through next door was packed with cars, even at 11 AM. DJ had the kids, and Evelyn could relax.

The dot on the screen raced forward unexpectedly, a straight line that skipped through building after building until it was in the middle of the ocean. What was DJ doing? Her hands gripped the screen as it went black. Someone pulled it gently from her hands.

""Evelyn?"" a voice said from beside her.

She jumped, the paper gown rubbing uncomfortably against her skin. She looked up at the man who'd spoken. DJ. The nurse. She was in a hospital. It was very cold. So was the tea in the paper cup.

""Can I have a blanket?""

""Of course! Let's get you back to your room. I'm glad the medication is helping you. How are you feeling today?""

Evelyn felt the gentle push of his hand on her shoulder as he guided her to her room. Rain slapped against the windows, lightning flashing between the bars. Right. Psychiatric wing. She'd attempted, and her wife had begged her to commit herself. They'd been sitting in a booth at Waffle House, hash browns all the way cold between them. Jessica had been crying. Butterflies had distracted her a moment, traipsing in the flowers by the door.

""Please, my love. Do it for me.""

Evelyn had relented. Jessica deserved a partner who was whole. The money from her book series, a romance about two men who had met while young, tending horses, was paying for this treatment.

""I'm... fine,"" Evelyn finally answered DJ. He had been so sweet to her the entire time she'd been here. ""What's the date?""

""June 12th. How was the maze today?""

""I've been here a week already?"" DJ hummed in agreement, harmonizing with the humming from the too-bright fluorescent lighting. ""I broke the code. Made the dot run through buildings.""

""Evelyn!"" DJ laughed. ""How did you manage that?""

""I don't know...""

They were in her room, the one she shared with another patient. Two twin beds, paper sheets, no sharp corners, nothing they could hurt themselves with. DJ placed a thin blanket on her shoulders.

""Jessica called. She'll be here this afternoon for lunch."" Evelyn smiled. At least she still had her Jessica.",1,1768063808.0,u_EliSimpsonWrites,0,1.0,False

I am a female age 52. I have been single for many many years as I was in a coercive control relationship and just didn’t even try to put myself out there. However I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019, a few months before COVID hit the uk, this made me realise I needed someone, even just a companion, I don’t know. So I decided that when I got better I would try dating. However fate had a different plan for me and a few months into my chemotherapy I was asked to make an appointment with my oncologist. That day I went in, not really expecting anything, but there were several nurses, doctors and my oncologist there. They had been checking my recent MRI scan and found the cancer had metastasised (spread) into my bones. I just nodded and listened not really thinking anything. I was expecting them to tell me what treatment I needed to cure this, so went numb when they said there’s no cure. I went to the appointment alone, drove myself home alone and sat on my sofa alone. I was going to die. That’s all I kept thinking. Anyway just to pile more on my shoulders…3 days later the UK went into the first 6 month lockdown and no one could go out or visit anyone. I had been told I had incurable cancer and would be alone for 6 months. There were 2 more lockdowns after that. As I was classed as vulnerable due to my health I couldn’t even go to the supermarket. All I could do was go to my appointments and treatments and walk my dog, all alone. Anyway, I didn’t expect to still be here. It has been over 6 years.

Olivia Newton-John had the same cancer I have and she lived for 15 years.
I have very few friends due to the coercive control relationship I was in, so I never go out. I have spent 5 Christmas’s on my own due to my mum going into a care home.

I am a female age 52. I have been single for many many years as I was in a coercive control relationship and just didn’t even try to put myself out there. However I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019, a few months before COVID hit the uk, this made me realise I needed someone, even just a companion, I don’t know. So I decided that when I got better I would try dating. However fate had a different plan for me and a few months into my chemotherapy I was asked to make an appointment with my oncologist. That day I went in, not really expecting anything, but there were several nurses, doctors and my oncologist there. They had been checking my recent MRI scan and found the cancer had metastasised (spread) into my bones. I just nodded and listened not really thinking anything. I was expecting them to tell me what treatment I needed to cure this, so went numb when they said there’s no cure. I went to the appointment alone, drove myself home alone and sat on my sofa alone. I was going to die. That’s all I kept thinking. Anyway just to pile more on my shoulders…3 days later the UK went into the first 6 month lockdown and no one could go out or visit anyone.

1q98oxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1q98oxo/coffee_and_a_cigarette/,Coffee and a cigarette," I normally start my morning with a few cups of coffee, and a couple of cigarettes. Coffee has to have creamer in it for me to drink it. I hate it black. You told me that you don't drink it because it would have to be entirely too unhealthy for you otherwise. Mine isn't Starbucks grade but it's not great for ya either.

I was standing outside this morning, having my half a cigarette and looking around. It's seldom felt like winter down here. But this morning, looking at the bare trees with the overcast backdrop and breezy chill in the air, it felt like a sign that it's starting to creep up on us. Not just that but, have you ever seen the Hitchcock movie The Birds? So many birds. It was almost eerie watching them fly in flocks back and forth. You might get a kick out of it. 

I've been having mortality on my mind lately. Wondering how much time I really have left here, floating on this giant rock. Thinking about things that I've taken for granted. Thinking about you. I remember when you had texted me, and I never responded. I was such a dick for that. You'd ended up sending me basically a farewell text afterwards, and I remember reading that and my mind went into full on panic mode. I know I would have deserved it if you'd stopped talking to me then. But you didn't. I haven't taken you for granted since. No, I just, ran off with someone else. Like a complete idiot. Losing you again for a time.

Now I feel like I'm getting a taste of my own medicine, for the second time in a row. There's nothing for me to do except to swallow it like an adult. 

I almost miss how we used to be. The goodnight texts, the dirty talk, chatting about the weather. I feel like the more we talk and the more you get to know me, the less interested you are. I almost want to spill all my feelings into a text just to get to the possible end. But I don't want an end to us. Whatever we are or will be.

You already know how I feel though, don't you?

Instead I'll sip another cup of coffee, take another drag, and send you well wishes until next time I hear your voice.",2,1768063110.0,UnsentTexts,1,1.0,False

### UI / Builder improvements
* Refreshed the **Catalog Editor layout** to use space better and feel less cramped.
* Improved the editor/preview flow so you can tweak filters without constantly fighting the UI.

### Watch providers (streaming services)
* Fixed the issue where people felt like providers were “missing” — the list is no longer artificially capped.
* Added **search + scrolling** so the provider list stays usable even when it’s huge.

### TV networks (broadcasters)
* Added a **searchable TV network picker**.
* Improved network discovery so networks show up reliably (networks are now derived from real TV show network data, not just a limited/quirky search path).

### Catalog ordering
* You can now **drag & drop catalogs in the sidebar** to reorder them.

### Language handling
* Proper split between:
    * **Original language** (what the content was produced in)
    * **Display language** (localized titles/overviews from TMDB when available)

1q98l10,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1q98l10/coffee_closure_turned_into_getting_my_sp_back/,Coffee closure turned into getting my SP back after the worst circumstances,"Hi everyone, I posted my story on here before and I decided to post my success story. In November my SP ended things and I was devastated. I was determined to manifest him back into my life but in order to do so I had to do a lot of inner work. People say “work on self concept” but they don’t really explain what that means, saying “I’m chosen” isn’t going to work unless you understand why and where that belief comes from first. Self concept is about understanding that these limiting beliefs and mindsets you have about others and yourself is what is causing your 3d outcomes. I may make a deeper post on this so I’m going to leave out this and focus on the success story. What I did was look deeper and take accountability for the 3d. Another thing I did was i stopped trying to control the 3d. I stopped trying to check up on him or email him proving I have changed. I also let go and detached. If I don’t have him that’s okay I will be okay, but if I do that will be amazing. 

The story:

Dec 1st my SP reached out said that it’s his last time emailing me before we meet for coffee on the 18th. I was not expecting him to email again. I deleted my email app because it’s not my main and I didn’t really care about his emails lmao. Then today I told my friend after she asked for updates that he said on the 1st that I will not hear from him again until the 18th. But that today I felt like he was here with me and when I woke up I thought he was here sleeping next to me… then I opened my email by accident on my laptop and I saw he emailed me even though he said he wouldn’t again until the 18th. He said he will see me on the 18th in our hometown and then he said to me that he will leave our home town afterwards on the 27th. I didn’t even ask him when he was flying back he just told me. I was not expecting him to email me.

This week my SP emailed me again — after he said, he wouldn’t email until the 18th (when we meet up for coffee) ☕️ I emailed him about the apartment because I was having issues and needed the landlords number. I did not mention coffee to him in that email. It wasn’t even emotional.

Then he gave me the number for the landlord. He also asks me to reconfirm coffee, even though I already confirmed it. Then he mentions us meeting at a beach, we used to go to a lot and we would hangout at when we first started seeing each other. He said he is open to meeting at this beach because he knows I don’t like talking about stuff in public places. This beach is really significant for me. This is the place I’ve dreamed of him proposing to me at. This is the place most significant in our relationship. He could’ve said any place to sit in his car and talk but he chose this one.

The beach closure talk: 

He told me he couldn’t pick me up, so I asked my sister to drive me. My sister was talking negative but I didn’t allow it to interfere with my thoughts. I didn’t complain about him like she was because I knew he was acting like this because of me.

At the beach I took accountability for everything and explained why I acted the way I did without blaming him. He also apologized for the terrible breakup he put me through. I didn’t beg for him at all and I think this is important. We actually laughed a lot and the chemistry was so intense. A lot of the conversation after we spoke about our relationship was about random things we normally talk about. He also told me that I’d keep the apartment for this semester but he will take it in the summer. We talked about how he will email me sometime in January about picking up his things. Then before he drove me home I asked him if in the future when I’m healed if we could get back together and he didn’t say no but never said yes. He only said maybe and it depends. I already gave him a cd of the soundtrack of a movie that we saw when he asked me out and he loved it. Then I gave him a book that I wrote in. The book was called before the coffee gets cold and I read it months before I met him. I remember thinking when I first read the book that I never want to be in a situation where I am unable to tell the person I love how I feel before it’s too late. He told me he would read it and what I wrote. We also made out and he joked that we can’t have sex because we would cry. 

The same day I hung out with a guy I knew since elementary school and I used to have a crush on him (had bad circumstances before and he blocked me) this guy is such a sweetheart and I really felt connected to him. Then when I got home a past SP (one that would always come in and out) requested me on Facebook and my Facebook is new with no profile picture and 10 friends. On my old Facebook over the years I would request and he would never accept it. Then the next day I get a email from my SP saying that he would like to meet up again because he felt like we didn’t touch on a few things (I personally felt like we did the first time). I asked him what’s it about and he said it’s about the book and he had a few questions about it. 

So the next day he picked me up and we went to another beach. He asked me about the book we talked about things and I said “I mean everything I said in the book,” and I voiced to him that I would like to start slow and rebuild our relationship. He asked me again if I meant everything in the book and he looked at me intensely then he kissed me. He looked at me and said that we can try again. We both said at the same time “I want to take things slow” and then I said “I would like for us to not live together for awhile though. I stay in the apartment and you Airbnb.” And he said that I took the words out of his mouth. Guys this is everything I wrote would happen(I scripted before like it already happened) before I went in the car with him. We also made out in the car and he said that we can hangout together on the 22nd or 23rd before he leaves on the 26th of December.

During this time all I wanted was to spend Christmas with SP. I wrote down that we would spend Christmas together and the day of the 23rd he got sick and said we can either hangout when I get better or hangout on Christmas Eve. I said to him “let’s hangout the 23rd” and he emailed me saying he would prefer hanging out the 24th because we have more time together and he wants to have a little Christmas with me. 

The 24th was magical we had so much fun and we were intimate together. It was amazing. He did however tell me that while he is visiting his dad he will not unblock me until the 5th of January and that we will only email. However a few times he would unblock me and FaceTime me for a bit. 

The day he got back he slept over and the next day we went for a drive. I see him today as well because we have a date every Saturday. 

So this is my story me and SP are back together.

How do you all manage it?,"My parents are approaching 70s, doing quite alright health-wise, no constraints financially for them, and living in a tier-1 city in India. The issue with them that I face is the lack of discipline/consistency. I think, for those of us who are in their 30s, most sets of parents would be 55-60+ (and I kindly request those who are less than 30s to refrain from commenting here unless you have some qualifications in healthcare, fitness, or wellness). 

They do quarterly blood/urine checkups, annual full checkups etc. all that stuff properly. No issues there. But the normal everyday stuff. Like eating more protein and fiber, walking more, lifting more, it’s just not happening for them. I tried consulting dieticians, nutritionists, fitness trainers, physical therapists. But to no avail. They try it out for a few days and then just give up. My dad has no pill dependency yet, my mom has pills for diabetes and arthritis. She was on remission for arthritis but something happened in mid 2025 and it caused her so much stress that she neglected her medicines and it flared up again. 

They have no hobbies or interests. Just sitting in front of the TV and watching the same 5-6 movies in rotation. My dad is still working part time, mom has retired, and I don’t care if they want to be unproductive. It’s their life. But it’s just the health stuff. My doctor friend lives in a different city and whenever she visits our hometown, she makes it a point to check on them. But they are so unwilling to form healthier habits. And their bodies aren’t 20-30 years old anymore to bounce back from their bad habits with a snap. If my dad sits on the floor, he can’t get up without external support. Either from someone holding him, or from the support of a coffee table or couch or some heavy piece of furniture. 

My siblings and I live overseas and try to check on them as often as we can, but habit formation is such a tough task at their age, that we are at a loss. They have consulted multiple doctors for their issues, which are quite minor and started predominantly during COVID when physical activity was almost zero for them. (Acidity, constipation etc.) The same consensus from all of them. Be more active, lift more, walk more, eat more protein and fiber and less processed carbs. They aren’t overweight. Neither one of them. My mom has a postpartum belly which never got back to normal and my dad is in good shape, but that’s fine. Not such a huge challenge in the grand scheme of things. 

They’re vegetarians, well, eggetarians. And they eat eggs almost everyday besides Saturday (religious reasons). But the habit of bread and biscuits and milk tea/coffee doesn’t go away no matter what. They don’t eat fruits or vegetables as often as they should. I really don’t get why that is. We send them informational pamphlets, ask the neighborhood doctors to check on them, whenever they visit us, we integrate their walks and exercises along with healthy meals into our routine. They usually feel fitter for a while but then they go back and then it’s back to the sluggishness. I’m quite frankly out of ideas. Other parents (at the risk of making the Sharmaji ka beta statement) at least go on religious retreats or participate in some volunteering stuff. But not my parents. “That’s an old people thing”. I mean WTF! 

How do you, as someone living away from your parents, especially out of town or out of the country, help out with parents and their health issues? Talking about normal lifestyle related health issues, not very serious stuff like organ failure or cancer or something too extreme. ",4,1768062756.0,ThirtiesIndia,2,0.84,False
1q98jdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q98jdk/the_places_i_go_because_of_my_dreams/,The places I go because of my dreams,"Madam Quinn was nearing the end of her life when she sold her hotel. A large mansion that had been in her family for the last few generations. She had turned it into a sea-side resort. As she aged, however, she stopped being able to maintain it, causing it to lose its appeal as it slowly wore down and lost its work force.



Now, I’m driving four hours to get there from home. The new owners, the Smiths, are trying to do it back up and make it into what it was before. I took a job offer to assist them.



Thankfully, I enjoy working with people, so it should be a good opportunity. 



I’ve spent my whole life following my dreams. That seems gooey and sentimental, but I mean dreams as in what happens when you sleep dreams, not aspirations. 



As early as being a toddler, I had a dream of dancing, so I asked my parents to put me into ballet. Then later I dreamt of doing MMA, and then I did. As I got older I would travel to places my dreams showed me, talk to people in them, do what I was shown, and this is no different.



A few weeks ago I dreamt of a star falling over it, and shadows creeping into Madam Quinn’s old hotel. My parents had taken me to the place when I was a kid, I remember playing in the ocean spray and building a sandcastle with my father.



I remember nearly drowning.



I had already been looking into the place when I saw the job listing go up in a facebook group I’m a part of. Someone just reposting a listing they saw somewhere else. I find that things like this tend to show up exactly when I need them. I’d been looking for a new job, anyway.



I get taken to the right places at the right times. I don’t know what would happen if I didn’t. I was on the rocks with mum when the UK scholarship came up, growing bored when the Spain trip came. Two places I had seen in my dreams, and two ways to get there as easily as possible.



The drive was quiet, I was about an hour away when I passed a sign pointing me to Freeling, and a petrol station. I needed to fuel up, and coffee didn’t sound bad. 



It was a small chain petrol station, the man behind the counter was older, with a thick beard and bald head. At least I assumed he was older at first, looking closer he couldn’t have been any older than myself. A young girl with curly black hair pulled into a ponytail sat on a stool behind the barista booth.



“Where are you headed?” The man asked after I had paid and was waiting for my order.



“Freeling,” I said casually.



“Why would you want to go there?” The girl turned her nose up, “It’s a shithole. Pardon my language”



“New job,” I shrugged.



“You must be the new employee of the Smiths,” The man’s eyes lit up, “Ma told me they pulled someone in from out of town.”



“How can you tell I’m from out of town?” I asked, shifting slightly.



“No one under the age of thirty five wears leather jackets around there,” The girl rolled her eyes, “And you are far too alt-y to be a younger person from there anyway.”



“So what you’re saying is I’m gonna stick out like a sore thumb?” I sighed, “Great…”



“Not a bad thing,” The man said, “They’ve been in need of something fresh for a while. My ma and I don’t live there, but she’s a general maintenance worker for a bunch of businesses in the area.”



“They’re in desperate need of fresh anything down that way,” The girl grumbled, “You would think the sea air would have kept it nice and bright, but no.”



“And something… dark has settled in over the town as well.” The man shook his head, “There’s just something not right there anymore.” 



Thanks for the confidence, I thought. I felt that a frown had settled on my face, and the two workers noticed it.



“I’m sure you’ll be fine,” The man chuckled, “From what ma’s said, you’ve got the job of running around and sorting everything out for them. Talking to tradies and stuff.”



“First I’m hearing of it,” It was my turn to roll my eyes, “The email said I would get the run-down once I got to the town in the first place. I didn’t even know where I was staying until yesterday!”

  


The girl shuddered, “I can’t even begin to imagine how much mold there would be in that old hotel. Right by the sea, how much salt would be caked onto the walls…”



“Heres your coffee,” The girl sighed and handed me my drink, “If you’re ever coming back this way for any reason, Max and I are on shift during the day together most of the time. We would love to hear from you.”



“Not much else to do out here but gossip, eh?” I offered with a smile.



The girl didn’t say anything else, but she gave an exasperated smile which was as much an answer to what I said as anything.



I was back on the road after that, with a pit in my gut. I looked at myself in the rearview mirror, considering dying my purple and black fully black. My appearance was one of the only things I ever really let myself decide.



If it wasn’t with dreams, I would often find guidance in the Tarot. I keep two decks, one in my glove box and one in my usual bag. Both were safely tucked away in the car for the time being. Friends had given me some fun decks over the years, with interesting art and alternate card names, but I only trusted those two with decisions and predictions.



Food is another thing I chose. And it was on my mind because whilst I had gotten some shitty fast food an hour and a half away from my home town, it was still light out and I had to figure out dinner.



As I got closer to the town, I started to feel the uneasy air, growing thicker the closer I got. That Max guy wasn’t wrong, there was something weird going on. The highway soon came up by the ocean. 



Grey clouds gather over the sea, bloating out the sun and dulling the world in muddy shades. Yellow sand shifted in the wind, flying up over the banks and getting lost in the air. The green paddocks on the left had wild flowers swaying, the last signs of summer as autumn set in.



Trees hadn’t started to turn yet, but the air had grown colder and the land darker. Well, as cold and as dark as it gets down under. The summer heat hadn’t quite left, which I rebelled against by wearing the thickest leather jacket I own over the blackest set of jeans in my collection.



It was always colder on the Victorian coast then it was up towards the alpine region. My home would hit the mid to high thirties for most of January and into February, but you could get more high twenties down this way.



The temperature had noticeably dropped a few degrees, as the car’s display so helpfully corroborated. It wasn’t even as hot as it would get in the day, but it was colder then it was back home.



I came over a hill, and over the crest I saw the town of Freeling sprawling upwards from the coast. Wide sand dunes gave way to brick buildings and asphalt. Going into the city off the highway was a new development, with more modern housing and aluminium roofs.  



Driving past the 80s brick housing, I made my way towards the beach. There was a large, glowing “MOTEL” sign, and below it a different sign read “Growling Street Motel”.



I pulled into the check in bay and got my phone, pulling up the booking details my new employers had sent me. Going inside there was a large man sitting at the desk. He had a thick moustache and large bald spot, he wore a shirt that showed off an ocean themed tattoo sleeve. One of his eyes seemed permanently closed.



He took one look at me before speaking, “You must be the girl the Smiths hired?”



“Yes sir,” I answered, clutching my phone to my chest.



He huffed and leant back, creaking like a wood board, and grabbed an envelope from behind him. 



“This has your keys, guest info, and wi-fi password in it,” He said, “Currently you’re booked here for two months, but if you end up getting out sooner or needing to stay longer, come back and give these to me and we’ll work it out.”



“Thank you,” I nodded as I took the envelope from his hands. There was a number printed on the front.



“Your room number,” The man supplied, “On the second floor, there are stairs on either side of the building to get up. Just find a spot to park.” He moved his hand to dismiss me, and I began to leave. 



“Oh, and Mate,” He called, “Try not to go out in the evening, people are seeing weird things in the ocean spray these days.”



“Okay,” was all I said before going back to my car. In the car park ahead there were already two cars parked in the middle, so I parked right in front of one of the staircases.



There was the small office building and the entry driveway, then starting on the right there was an L building that wrapped around the back, The right side was only a single storey, with the back section becoming two. 



I got out of the car and grabbed two bags for now, my every-day bag, and one of my clothing bags. The smell of seaweed and salt rolled off the waves, carried in by the oncoming storm. It was strong, with the beach only being across the road.



I stopped on the second storey balcony, from here I could see the hotel. It was at the end of the main road running along the beach, Growling Street. There was a large cliff at the south end of town where the hotel sat. The cliff was a gradual hill up to its sudden drop off, on one side you had a beach, the other cliff and rocks. 



Freeling wrapped itself from the cliff’s beach about 5 kilometers across the main Eastern Victorian shoreline. It had begun developing itself back into the land and bush behind it.



The hotel, by the looks of it, was still being fumigated for bugs or mold. But it was there, covered in a massive tent. 



I found my room, room 14, and went inside. Nothing fancy, a double bed, a small desk with a mini fridge on the ground and microwave up on a shelf. There was a TV on the wall and a door to a wardrobe. There was also a door to a bathroom.



A note on the small pantry above the minifridge said that there was extra cutlery and dishes in a kitchenette. I took a look, it was two doors down towards the middle, but there was no over or grill. No cooking, it seemed.



I went back to my room and threw myself into the bed. It wasn’t dark outside so I was just messing around on my phone. I had a message from my mum, asking if I got to town alright. I told her I did and found my accommodations.



By the time the sun started setting around 6:30 I got up and headed out on foot to find a store. After having fast food lunch I wasn’t exactly in the mood for it again.



There was a coles a couple of blocks over, and I spent a decent amount of time walking the aisles to get something to eat. I stocked up on microwave meals and snacks, a couple per-made salads and milk. Bread, cheese and deli meats were also on the menu.



As I walked around I could feel some eyes linger on me. It wasn’t as if Freeling was that small, but I got the feeling that it was a kind of “Everyone knows everyone” deal. A newcomer, especially one dressed how I dress, would have been a stand out to anyone.



I was relived to see self-checkouts and skedaddled my way back to the motel and unpacked, both my shopping and the bag I had been bothered to carry up. It had some more “Professional” clothing in it for meeting my new bosses the next day and the couple of days after that.



Once I felt a little more settled, I heated up one of the meals I got and turned on the TV in the room. It had an AppleTV and Chromecast option on it, so I sat in to catch up on a show a friend recommended.



I fell asleep after sleeping and slipped into the familiar fog of a dream.



I was standing before the hotel deep in the night. A shell coloured traditional mansion. The siding was peeling at the blue windowsill and trims were worn as well, the awning over the entrance sagged. The four storey building imposed over, an unearthly green light bloomed from the top floor windows. 



I walked up the stairs and pressed through the dark blue doors, entering into the main hall. Cleaning tools and devices sat abandoned, and half the wallpaper had been pulled from the walls.



I walked up the grand stairs in front of me and continued up. Dilapidated halls stretched out beside me as I got to the top, where I tracked down the source of the green light.



A door stood ajar halfway down the centre hall, and opening the door flooded my vision with light. Voices speaking in a language I didn’t know started to panic, and opening my eyes against the light I saw not quiet human shapes moving towards me.



I started awake, shooting up in bed. The fog of sleep pulled back from my mind as I got up. I threw my jacket back on, deciding that I needed a walk. Getting onto the balcony I looked back over to the tented hotel. Just a dream.



A thick, salty, mist was being blown in by a harsh wind. I had a foreboding feeling as I went down the stairs and out onto the street. Shadows caught on the rolling spray, causing me to jump when I caught them in the condor of my eyes. I shook myself, it was silly to be scared.



I buried myself in my jacket as I walked, but the shadows seemed to become more… Distinct. And was the spray thicker than it was earlier?



The shadow of a man ran in the mist in front of me, something strange chased him. More and more of the creatures appeared as shadows in front of me. I turned back and started jogging back to my motel.



A shadow brushed my shoulder and I felt it. My shoulder pushed back with it, and I had to course correct to avoid falling. Then another. I stumbled over myself and I picked up my speed. Something else passed me and I felt a small trickle of blood on my hand. I started dodging out of the way of shadows as best I could, but I tripped over one and fell to the ground scraping my hands. My mouth was coated in salt. All I could smell was salt. Salt had begun to cake itself onto my body.



I dashed through the arch leading into the motel, it faced the ocean so I wasn’t free of the mist. Something massive took shape in the spray above the water, the shape of a man, but not quite, obscured by the uneven surface. It reached out for me and I turned to run to my door. My car wouldn’t be safe, what good is a Toyota Corolla against shadows?



I sprinted up the metal stairs to get to the second floor. I just passed the landing when I slipped on the pooling water, foot going out behind me. I threw my arms out and caught myself, getting salt water in the scrapes on my hand. I hissed and pulled myself up, making it the rest of the way up.



I fumbled with my keys as the massive hand of the shadow came towards me, barely getting the keycard to the door before I forced my way in. I felt the tip of a large finger against me as I rushed in and slammed the door behind me. I dropped to the floor and laid down there while I caught my breath, still breathing in the scent of salt. My jacket cracked, white patches of salt had hardened to it.



Once my legs stopped feeling like jelly I got up and rinsed my mouth and nose out as best as I could. The taste still lingered but it wasn’t overpowering anymore. I also made sure to drink plenty of tap water. I went over to the window and peeked out the curtain, expecting to see the shadows, but the spray had died down and there were no mysterious shapes to be seen.



The motel owner had mentioned people seeing things, but that was a lot more than just “seeing things"". I kept expecting to wake up again, but the gentle embrace of sleep had long since left, and I was standing awake and shaking in my motel.



I crawled into bed to fight the shiver that had crawled into me, the warmth of the doona comforted me, and eventually I fell back to sleep. No other dreams came to me that night and I woke up the next day still feeling exhausted.



I will never forget my first night in Freeling, a chill runs to my bones when I think about it. There is something wrong with the air in that town, but those shadows aren’t the reason, just a symptom.",1,1768062755.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

They're always shaking unless I have them on a flat surface or holding something. I know it's not medication related since I've had it since I can remember, and I've only been medicated for a little under 5 years. I know that ADHD can cause balance issues etc. so I thought it'd be a good idea to ask if anyone else has this too. I will say I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember and recently diagnosed with POTS so that could be it as well. The degree that my hands shake is like spilling a bowl of water or a coffee if I'm walking. My hands eye coordination is subpar at best. Even when trying to take a video you can see the phone moving around a bunch. My selfies are almost always blurry thanks to that.

He came home with a coffee and handed me a large ice water. Except my ice water was in a fast food cup and his cup was from a coffee  location. I asked why the cups are from different spots. He said he found the fast food cup in the back of his truck. 

Cup was from when we moved 3 weeks ago. Still smells faintly orange soda. It’s not the grosses thing in the world, but bro. What the fuck.

I made a face and asked why didn’t he get me a coffee. “You don’t like hot coffee.” Which is a lie. I PREFER iced coffee, yes. But I’ve never turned down hot coffee. Especially if my choice is ice water in a cup you picked out of your trucks garbage can. 

He tried giving me his coffee but I don’t want it. Every time he takes a sip, he tries to offer me a sip. Shake my head no. Now he’s saying I have an “attitude.” It’s not the coffee, it’s the lack of consideration or thought of me. Plus you gave me iced water (of all things??) in a dirty cup.

I love gothic literature and science fiction even though I don't have the patience to read more then 30 minutes a day!

I love rock ,60s and Metal, and electric music and even vocaloids (despite being filthy clankers)! I also listen to other genres, especially if they use traditional or folkish music, but those are my main ones!

I love consuming unhealthy amounts of coffee, energy drinks, sodas, and some teas!

I love breathing air, drinking fluids (especially if its caffeine), sleeping on beds, and eating foods!

I like drawing, even though I don't do it so much anymore, love looking at art though!

1q98gc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/F4481/comments/1q98gc0/support_group_update/,Support group update,"Hi all!

I recently got accepted to a support group/psychoeducation program at McLean for people with DID and extreme trauma related dissociation. I feel very grateful to have the opportunity, but there are a few hiccups, namely transportation.

I live in the western part of the state and don’t have a car, which means I’d have to take the bus or train to Boston to attend- there’s no virtual option. The bus is 2.5 hours each way and I’d get back at midnight, and the train is 5 hours each way. In other words, it’s an enormous commitment.

The program is about a year and a half and in three stages, following the Finding Solid Ground workbook/curriculum. My therapist mainly wants me to attend because I feel completely isolated and broken due to this disorder, and have never met anyone else who has it to my knowledge- she thinks having other people who are going through something similar will make me feel less like I’m losing my mind.

But I don’t know if the commute is worth it. It means I wouldn’t be able to work Tuesdays and I’m worried the stress of commuting will outweigh the benefits. 

Alternatively, my best friend lives in Boston, which means if I do the group we’d be able to get coffee and connect, which is a benefit. 

I’m leaning towards giving it a shot, but still waffling. Thoughts? ",5,1768062565.0,F4481,4,1.0,False
1q98gat,https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6QxsyQKPc3Xk4AkbQVbVmb?si=2219cdf2f5f8454f,Desert Sunrise: Morning Reset 🌅,"You know that rare morning when you wake up early and instead of immediately checking your phone or making a list, you just... sit there? Light coming through the window, coffee getting cold in your hand, and for once you're not trying to be anywhere or do anything. That's what this playlist understands.

This isn't background music and it's not a meditation soundtrack either. There's real melody here, groove, soul but it's all softened, like colors before sunrise fully breaks. Nothing's trying to make you feel a certain way. It's just emotionally available, which somehow makes it perfect for those liminal moments when you're coming down from whatever yesterday was and not quite ready for today. The tempo sits right at ""awake but still inward."" Music that knows how to sit with someone instead of performing at them.

I made this for mornings when I need to recalibrate. When the world can wait another twenty minutes. Put it on while you're making breakfast or staring out the window with that second cup. It won't pull you out of wherever your head is; it just holds the space. Intimate without getting heavy, interesting without demanding anything. It'll make the morning feel slower in the best possible way.

Last Updated: 10:15am CST

Every week I take Vegas lines + odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings and FanDuel DFS salaries to create a value score, which helps determine who’s overpriced vs underpriced.

These typically lean toward chalk / higher-owned plays, so they’re great for double-ups and safer builds, but use them however they fit your strategy.

\---

⭐️ Core Optimizer Plays

I run an optimizer each slate to find the strongest lineup structures. I don’t post full lineups (Due to TOS and everyone would be on the same lineup anyway), but here are a few core pieces popping up in all of my builds:

* **QB:** TBD
* **RB:** TBD
* **WR:** TBD
* **TE:** TBD
* **DST:** TBD

# Winter? I Hardly Know Her

January is borrowing straight from December's weather playbook. Usually our coldest month, temperatures climbed to 88° on January 2 - the second warmest January day on record.

Thanks to lingering La Niña, forecasters say warmer-than-normal days are sticking around. Cold fronts will still roll through with brief dips into the 40s and 30s before handing things back to patio weather. Sweaters remain on standby.

# This Weekend's Events (January 10-11)

**TODAY - SATURDAY JANUARY 10:**

**Brunching for Stevie** \- Hops & Thyme, 11am-3pm, $30. Brunch tastes better when it helps a neighbor - 100% of proceeds support longtime Lakeway favorite Stevie's recovery and return home.

**Free Tennis Day** \- Legend Tennis Academy, 12-2pm, FREE. Love means nothing in tennis, but free means everything.

**Lucky Rabbit Pop Up Shop** \- Lucky Rabbit, 12-4pm, FREE. Shop small and sip a cold one while browsing unique local goods right in Jonestown.

**SUNDAY JANUARY 11:**

**Octane at The Oasis** \- The Oasis, 8-11am, $10. Cars and coffee with a lake view that beats any garage lineup.

# Next Week's Events (January 12-14)

**Classic Rock Music Bingo** \- Hops & Thyme, Sunday Jan 12, 6:30pm, FREE. Traditional bingo swapped for guitar riffs and recognizable choruses.

**Red River Cultural District Free Week** \- Red River Cultural District, past event but worth noting for future reference. Free tunes at venues across downtown.

**Hot Wheels Monster Trucks Live** \- The Moody Center, past shows but good to know about future events.

**Valentine's Day Massacre** \- Crossfit Lake Travis, Feb 7, 7am-4pm, $204. Trade roses for kettlebells at this Crossfit event where the only thing getting crushed is your PRs.

# Weekend Highlights

**For Supporting Community:** Brunching for Stevie today is 100% proceeds going to help a longtime Lakeway favorite recover and return home. That's the kind of community support that makes Lake Travis special.

**For Free Activities:** Free Tennis Day at Legend Tennis Academy today 12-2pm is a solid deal if you've been wanting to try.

**For Shopping Local:** Lucky Rabbit Pop Up Shop today noon-4pm combines local goods with cold beer - can't beat that combination.

**For Car Enthusiasts:** Octane at The Oasis tomorrow morning is the classic cars and coffee meetup with the best lake view in Texas.

# Major Bee Cave Development News

**CesiumAstro Satellite HQ:** After a year of legal drama, the industrial site off 71 will become CesiumAstro's headquarters instead of distribution warehouses. Traffic drops dramatically, and the city walks away with $500K and a much quieter outcome. That construction eyesore is getting a major plot twist.

**Village of Spanish Oaks:** That construction off 71 across from McCoy's is The Village of Spanish Oaks - planned for hotel, spa, shops, homes, and senior living. It's up for discussion at the next city council meeting Monday Jan 13 at 6pm if you want to weigh in.

**La Cabana Reopening:** La Cabana is popping back up at the old Apis Restaurant just down the road from their original location. Look for them to reopen mid-January with a fresh address but the same favorite flavors.

# Lago Vista Land Sale

Just listed in Lago Vista - a rare 315-acre tract inside city limits has hit the market, complete with cove access on Lake Travis, mature oak trees, and wide-open pastures. All for $31.5M.

It's the kind of land you almost never see this close to Austin. Naturally sparks big ""what could this become?"" conversations - from private family compound to luxury estates or something more thoughtfully planned. At minimum, it's a reminder that Lago Vista still has meaningful room to shape its future.

# Lake Travis 2026 Resolutions

Not the ""wake up at 5am"" kind - this is the Lake Travis edition. Some ambitious, some aspirational, some we'll absolutely abandon by February:

* Finally learn the back roads (no more pretending you meant to end up on 620)
* Watch at least one sunset without checking your phone
* Support one new local business a month (coffee counts, so does beer)
* Attend one event you found here
* Say yes to more ""last-minute"" Hill Country plans (the best ones usually start that way)
* Become a regular somewhere where the barista, bartender, or brewery dog knows your order
* Spend more time outside than inside HEB (ambitious, we know)
* Try one thing that feels very ""Lake Travis"" but you've never done (early-morning car meet, sunset hike, live music on a random Tuesday)
* Host more, scroll less (neighbors over feeds, drinks optional, connection required)

So this afternoon I decided to trial it in the hopes I’m:
1 not buying more items for particular things 
2 saving money 
3 using less chemicals to clean 

Areas I’ve cleaned: 
All surfaces 
Bathroom sinks toilets and sides 
Mirrors 
Windows and windowsills
Kitchen cupboards 
Sinks 

And I’m actually shocked, I’ve found it picks up more dust than the spray cleaners I was using and everything wipes off easier such as tea stains on sides after making coffee etc, bathrooms sinks ext came up shining too! 

I might be converted with the obvious choice of still getting bleach for floors and inside the toilet. Has anybody else ever heard this before it’s blew my mind! ",6,1768062354.0,poor,9,0.8,False

Fast forward a few years and there's all sorts of findings about protein, rapamycin and glp and sauna and vo2 max and different exercise zones and ldl tests and statins and yada yada yada.

Should I ignore all that and just exercise regularly, sleep well, eat a balanced diet, drink moderate amounts of alcohol, have some coffee every now and then  and avoid processed foods?

Is everything else just noise? Even the ""good stuff"" I included with exercise in the previous paragraph?

1q98aen,https://i.redd.it/q9cted2msjcg1.jpeg,Melitta Filtercone a less than obvious gem.,"Hi all, so been slowing making my way through a variety of brewers this month. The Cafec Deep 27 for small gram brews, the UFO for balanced acidity and creamy dreamy drinks, the Orea V3 for fast florals, and sitting at the back of my counter is the Melitta Filtercone. She sits there patiently amongst great company, watching as I choose from my many brewers, hoping one day I’ll pick her up. Well my pour over friends, that was today, and the simple reason, I wanted to brew some big, slow, pours. 22g coffee with 374g water (1:17 ratio), 5-6min draw downs. Well, she has not disappointed. January has seen me brewing with coffee from Sweven, DAK, and Podda & Wren. She made my final brew with Sweven sing, hitting lovely brambley hedge berries and floral honey tones. Never happy with just one coffee, thought about doing the same thing with my DAK Purple Rain. Now if you’ve seen some of my previous post I’ve not had many good things to say about this bean. Well, I will admit, the Melitta worked her little two holes off (that sounds so bad) to produce what I think is the best I have managed with this coffee. I’m still not getting grape soda and purple candies, but I am tasting juicy purples and violets if that makes sense. Well I just wanted to share this with you all.

Ol Melitta, if you have one but don’t use often, then dust her off and take the girl dancing. She still has some moves.
