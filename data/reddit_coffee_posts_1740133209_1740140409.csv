I‚Äôm making this thread to ask you people about setting up this beautiful machine I just bought. 

- How many bars of pressure you use? Some swear by 9, others love 6. What do you use, and why?

- how do you use the pre-brewing option? How many seconds on, how many off? How do you count them towards the total extraction time?

- at what temperature do you brew? Is 94 too much? I typically drink an omni-roasted caturra, with fruit culturing because i love the funky notes and it goes well both in espresso/milk-based drinks and also with my random chemex cravings.

1iupibn,https://i.redd.it/aw0oet9zhhke1.jpeg,It is amazing to see how Blume breaks down India's market into three layers üßê,"
(a). India 1(Mexico)
- Roughly 10% of the population, APC income ‚Üí $15K 
- High-spenders who drive trends in premium products and services:like  Blue Tokai Coffee, Licious, Country Delight. 
- Startups target India1 early because they're willing to pay premium prices and their consumption habits drive broader market trends.

(b). India 2 (Indonesia)
- 30% of households, APC income ‚Üí $3K
- Reading this, startups like KukuFM: Micropayment models to lower entry barriers drive adoption within this segment (Netflix also introduced a mobile only option for ~ ‚Çπ150/month, trying to cater to this segment).
- Exceptionally challenging to convert them into paying customers.

(c). India 3 (Sub Saharan Africa)

I'm still trying to adapt the coffee chroniclers standard switch recipe for smaller dose do coffee 15g coffee to 240g water, but I have trouble with extracting the same flavours from those beans as I have managed using same recipe but 20:320 ratio.  
  
Today I added a bit of agitation in the first phase with pouring with open switch as those early acidic fruity flavors seemed muted in my last cup, but it didn't help at all. So my today's recipe was 120g water with open switch, swirl the coffee. Close at 45 sec pour quite aggressively 120g more water, finish pouring at 1:10 and open switch at 2:00. Drawdown finished at about 3:10. I used 93¬∞C water
  
The final resulting cup is quite weak. It has barely to none bitterness or acidity. I think the flavor of  pineapple are really muted and in the background.
  
I'm not sure whether this recipe is just not suited for those small doses or should I still try to troubleshoot it. I tried to go finer than I am today but I felt like I achieved no fruitiness at all not just muted fruits",1,1740139973.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

1iupgkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScoliosisTeens/comments/1iupgkf/my_scoliosis_story_new_updates_coming_soon_an/,My scoliosis story (new updates coming soon). An insight into what life with scoliosis is like.,"In January of 2024, I was 14. 

My mother walked into the bathroom as I was showering (rude, I know right?!) Self conscious of my changing body I peered curiously around the shower curtain to see what she was doing. She told me to ""stand up straight"" which was weird as I felt like I was and I always have good posture.

One shoulder was significantly higher than the other, with part of my rib cage bigger than the other. I'd never really looked at myself in this way however I did see what everyone was referring to.

By June my mother had booked me in to see my paediatrician, who sent me off for an X-ray.

Nervous as I have never had any serious medical issues, I stood there cold and shaking in one of those tie up gowns. 

The X-ray tech was a lovely man who made me feel like we were old friends. It was no different to a picture that lasted no longer a second, we took a couple of images.

I had no clue what my spine would look like, the tech told me ""I'll need to consult my supervisor"". A wave of panic washed over me as he left the room, I was alone, my mother in the waiting room, just me, myself, and my thoughts to keep me company.

I tentitavley peered over at the screen out of anxiety of what was to come and sheer curiosity. I see my spine all crooked and bent, unsure what to think I wander back to where I was standing previously. The Tech comes back with his supervisor and asks why the image isn't lining up...

The supervisor took one look at the image and muttered to herself ""Oh wow, that's an impressive curve"" before saying out loud ""It's meant to look like that, it's for a scoliosis diagnosis, obviously"". They then send me and my mum on my way.

By august 2024, I was 15. 

We had a specialist appointment. The Doctor had analysed my X-ray, tested my reflexes and with a thoracic curve of 53 degrees. He told me in a pragmatic tone ""There is no doubt you have scoliosis. Bracing wouldn't be effective and we should concider surgery whilst it's still relatively early"".
He then proceeded to refer me to the Royal Childrens Hospital, for surgery.

We didn't hear back for a few months however by October 15 I had my first day at the hospital.

October 15 2024,

The hospital was colourful, with fish, meerkats and shops. It had multiple fun stuff for kids (because it was a childrens hospital duh).

It was a long day however I got a total of three X-rays, and a blood test. Everyone was so nice and caring, I even had a boost juice and lunch with my mum (they have cool restaurants INSIDE the hospital) 

I met my surgeon who wanted me to get a blood test, and a traction X-ray (where they pull and stretch you in an X-ray, which didn't hurt at all).

The blood test was fine, I had a green squishy cat I got to hold and keep. But after I felt like fainting which was kind of scary, the nurse was so kind and got me a cold glass of water which helped a lot. My heart was racing and it felt like my senses were almost fading slowly away. I don't think I ever fully lost conciousness but I was pretty close to losing it.

After that intense long day, we drove home and I slept all the way in the car (best sleep I ever had, slept quite literally like a baby).

The new year came (2025) and I was starting to get a sharp, pinchy pain in my mid-lower back. I was still on the waitlist for the surgery, days became long and tiring, and summer break was almost over.

Janurary 19 2025

It was a Sunday, the hospital was quiet. I had my first ever MRI. I met with a funny man who would talk to my whilst I was in the MRI. We picked a movie to watch (The lion king - live action) and my mum left to get a coffee.

I lie down on the MRI bed and they put these special earphones on so I can hear the movie. The table moves up and down, and in and out. It was crucial that I stayed perfectly still so the image was clear.

I never really got why people said MRIs are so loud, it just sounded like a nock on a door whilst a phone was vibrating like crazy. I don't really know how to describe it LOL!

I could not focus on the movie as my thoughts were loud (and so was the machine, just a bit)

The MRI lasted a total of 45 minutes. I slipped my shoes on and eargerly left the raidiology department and went up the bright green elevators to see my mum. 

As I mentioned before, the hospital was quiet because it was a weekend, me and my mum went to get lunch. It was 1pm and I was STARVING! (I got tuna sushi which was quite authentic)

Then I proceeded to beg my mum to let me see the funny blue fish with the long nose in the lobby. (For those who are wondering yes I got to see mg fish bestie).

I got a Sonny Angel as a reward for being so well behaved (okay I may be a bit immature but I cannot say no to a Sonny Angel figure, especially if I can get the frog one) I sadly opened a unicorn.

Then I went home and rested. (Whilst also watching the rest of the amazing lion king)
Nobody talks about how tiring just going to the hospital is, even though I just layed down and watched a movie lmao.

I am currently on the waitlist for spinal fusion, the pain is incrementally getting worse day by day. But I strongly believe I can and will recover.

I just hope I can go back to competitive swimming and do as well as I used to do after surgery. 

I have no clue when the surgery is, I was told I will get 24 hours notice. So welcome to the Australian healthcare system where the waitlists are long but the healthcare is cheap.

More updates coming soon, so stay tuned! And thank you all who have and are supporting my journey!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

- Roughly 10% of the population, APC income ‚Üí $15K 
- High-spenders who drive trends in premium products and services:like  Blue Tokai Coffee, Licious, Country Delight. 
- Startups target India1 early because they're willing to pay premium prices and their consumption habits drive broader market trends.

(b). India 2 (Indonesia)
- 30% of households, APC income ‚Üí $3K
- Reading this, startups like KukuFM: Micropayment models to lower entry barriers drive adoption within this segment (Netflix also introduced a mobile only option for ~ ‚Çπ150/month, trying to cater to this segment).

A light and buttery cake filled with juicy sultanas, perfect for pairing with a cup of tea or coffee!

‚úÖ 140g margarine or butter (room temperature)  
‚úÖ 140g caster sugar  
‚úÖ 3 free-range eggs  
‚úÖ 225g self-raising flour  
‚úÖ ¬º tsp lemon extract (optional)  
‚úÖ 170g sultanas (golden raisins)

Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  
Beat in the eggs one at a time, adding a little flour if needed to prevent curdling.  
Fold in the remaining flour, lemon extract (if using), and sultanas until just combined.  
Pour into a lined loaf tin and bake at 170¬∞C (340¬∞F) for 40‚Äì45 minutes or until golden and a skewer comes out clean.

*Tips & Tricks:* Soak the sultanas in warm water or tea for 10 minutes before adding them to the batter for extra moisture. Store in an airtight container to keep the cake soft and fresh for days!

1iup9dc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1iup9dc/what_to_do_next_long_story/,What to do next (long story),"I‚Äôm 22, and I hate my life. I feel like I‚Äôm 50. I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for seven years, but I‚Äôm no longer attracted to her sexually, and I don‚Äôt have fun with her. The only thing I still like is cuddling with her because it gives me a sense of warmth‚Äîif you know what I mean.

We moved out together 10 months ago, and we‚Äôve had sex maybe seven times. The last five times were only because of Valentine‚Äôs Day or her birthday; it never happened because I genuinely wanted to.

I feel like I can‚Äôt be irresponsible or act childish because of her. But sometimes, I really want to‚Äîbecause I feel like my golden teenage years were ruined by being in this relationship. I didn‚Äôt meet new people, experiment, or do the dumb stuff that teenagers usually do.

I‚Äôve always felt like I needed to leave her because i had to hide my true self but never had enough courage to do it. People look at me as if I‚Äôve got everything figured out‚ÄîI have a nice job and have achieved a lot academically compared to my close friends and relatives. But i feel like a failure.

I also kind of cheated on her twice with my last girlfriend/neigbor. We didn‚Äôt have sex, but we hung out during quarantine, and there was some sexual tension between us. We kissed and did some other things, but never had sex. That was the only time in my life when I felt real passion toward someone.

My mom always asks me why I started to really neglect myself. I don‚Äôt cut my hair on time, I dress like crap, and I‚Äôve gained a bit of weight over the past two years. But in my head, the reason is that I just don‚Äôt see the point in taking care of myself when she loves me anyway.

Today, I decided to write this because my brother became better friends with my friends in half a year than I did in six years. I can rarely go out, and even when I can, I don‚Äôt stay long because I have work or chores the next day. No one gives me advice because I don‚Äôt talk about my emotions. I think it‚Äôs either because people are scared to hurt my feelings or they just don‚Äôt know what to do with my situation.

I also feel financially stuck. The rent isn‚Äôt that high, but it still takes up half of my paycheck. My closest friends and my brother live with their parents or have better living situations, so they can afford to party, experiment, and travel‚Äîthings I can‚Äôt do. Because of my financial situation, I can‚Äôt achieve one of my real dreams: owning a nice old BMW.

Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know how to approach any of this. I feel like I don‚Äôt really know who I want to be. I just know that I want to have someone to go to classical music concerts with, to grab a cup of coffee at a caf√©, and to share mutual passions with. These are the things I‚Äôm sure I want.

I know I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes, and I know I‚Äôm not the best person, but I feel so lost. Sometimes, it feels like the best thing that could happen is if a war started and I just went to die in a warzone.

1iup668,https://www.reddit.com/r/thetron/comments/1iup668/humble_enough/,Humble enough,"So There is a lady who buys coffee in town and its a popular busy coffee shop around centre place and I‚Äôve noticed that the way she speaks to the staff makes them uncomfortable. She often interrupts the barista while they‚Äôre simply confirming her order(duh they dont wanna mess your Drink), claiming she has been a regular customer for six years. However, the barista at the counter finds her tone rude and outright abusive. 

Its kinda uncomfortable to see these days that they need to treat staff members with respect. Working in hospitality is challenging, and behavior is unacceptable even status as a regular customer does not excuse disrespectful behavior and work on your humility. You have no idea what the barista or any staff member might be going through, especially during busy hours. Kindness costs nothing, Just ranting to ppl are too much entitled and calling out the rudeness. ",4,1740138965.0,thetron,0,1.0,False

I was born in Maryland, raised in West Virginia, and have a lot of blood in Virginia, too. This felt like home to me, but then I realized that home is a time for me, as well as people. I lost my mom last month, and my dad 12 years ago. I live with my wife and our son internationally, I have for many years. But something in me feels adrift, along with totally heartbroken.


I miss my family that are gone. I miss my mom. I feel like a little boy lost in a grocery store, but I have to pretend to be a big grown-up.


I'm sad and afraid of what's happening to my country. It's making that loss of home feel even more real. Whenever someone asks if I'm American now, it feels like I need to prepare to explain decisions I have nothing to do with nor support, rather than talk about Tudor's and road trips and free coffee refills.


There is a beautiful drive from Charlotte NC to Cool Ridge WV. Up through a town called Fancy Gap, there's a view around there that feels like you can see all the way to the ocean. 


It's a trip I've taken many times with my parents. With my wife and our son. A son I wanted to be proud of his heritage, whichever he chose; crab worship or the Mothman. Now I'm worried for that. 


As Theoden said, alas that these evil days should be mine. I feel crestfallen as fuck and my heart is in a million weird pieces.


I know many have it worse. And i still have so much to be thankful for, and I am. I'm just hurting. 


How green was my valley.

I got irritated so much so that i changed all my passwords and never logged in with my socmed on that pc again. Just now though, my dad asked me ‚Äúhow high a 95 was in our school‚Äù. 

For context , yesterday my teacher had emailed me that she gave me a 95, so i knew he was snooping again.  He tried to play it off like I left the tab open, but unlike him, im technologically literate.

1) I did not leave my school account logged in because I log it out, and it automatically logs out after closing the browser. 

2) he claims he saw it when i was making coffee, i made coffee yes, but that was 3 hours before the email was sent, and when said email was sent, I was already in classes, and so my pc would have been turned off. I showed him that it was impossible , and he got mad and even tried to fistfight me(he has mental issues)


3) His snooping caused me to entirely shift the messaging app i use since he always used to find a way to log in. He found about some stuff and scolded ME for it. I complained to my family members and when they scolded him, he had the GALL to get mad at ME for embarrassing him.

im getting a macbook next week for unrelated reasons, and though it‚Äôs my first, i trust that i can keep my secrets safe there. I will completely log out everything on my windows pc, except for steam and i will use it as a gaming rig instead.  However, i might use it for schoolwork. Is there any way to have a secret user on windows when turning the pc on?


So If the pc is turned on, i can log into my account with a pun or password, and if he turns it on he can log in his account without a password?

P.S : yes like so many of my friends and family members have said, im probably gonna move out within the year. Im tired of his bullshit, and hes actually pretty abusive, physically and emotionally and allat.  Hes a pain in the ass narcissist who‚Äôs a warfreak and blah blah. Hes toxic and hes the type of parent you wouldnt even put in a nursing home in and just completely abandon.

1iuoyjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/apprenticeuk/comments/1iuoyjh/the_future_of_the_apprentice_appalling_candidates/,"The Future of The Apprentice, appalling candidates, and British Business TV shows","After the last few episodes (and maybe even series) of the Apprentice, I have been trying to understand how, why, and where it all went wrong for the show and shows of a similar theme. I wanted to hear what people think about the current state of the show and other British business related tv shows and their future.  



If we cast our minds back to the first seasons of the apprentice, it all seemed so much more authentic, uncut, and real. The candidates were (on the whole) genuine business people with a desire to win. I think of candidates like Syed, Tim, Ruth, and compare them to the dross we experience these days. For example, Nadia. I understand the editing is focused toward entertainment, but the entire show must've dramatically shifted at some point because there is no way you could put Nadia in Season 1 or 2 and her behaviour would go unchecked and her decisions wouldn't be literally shouted over. 

Candidates like Nadia do make me rethink how easy this process would be, especially under the new format of softly softly whoopsie daisy entertainment. Having to deal with genuinely incompetent people takes a huge level of patience and diplomacy. I think I personally would've lost it with Carlo after the first ""sales strategy"" meeting in Austria. He was all smoke no fire, just a rolling spew of entrepeurship-wannabe instragram account quotes and no action but plenty of ego. 



Anyway, I would love to see the apprentice (or a rival show) go back to the model of genuinely capable people in an unscripted environment competing in hackathon style business tasks. The current format makes British entrepreneurship look like a bit of a joke, especially when they stress that they've selected top british entrepreneurs for the process.  I know the purpose of the show isn't to advertise British entrepreneurship, but I think it would be important given the economic climate that we do actually start to take our own image a bit more seriously. In a terribly anti-British fashion, I'd love to see the self-deprecating comedy move aside for reality tv shows that involve business or entrepreneurship. 

Dragons den has also changed course, albeit much less agressively, towards an ultra-pleasant product placement show which (imo) is significantly scripted and used to build the brand image of primarily the dragons and also the products that feature. They also include the occasional disaster class for entertainment. This is again a stark change from what we used to witness in earlier series with Dragons happily ripping off the heads of incompetent pitchers and the pitchers being genuinaly nervous (to the point of sweating, stuttering, and breaking down) and using it as a genuine primary avenue for business development.

With the rise of at-home-entrepreneurs and solopreneurs, i think the general public have a greater interest in and knowledge of real business and entrepreneurship and a show that takes itself a lot more seriously would be really successful. I would definitely tune in every week to see a group of genuinely talented young entrepreneurs compete in a business enviornment in the uncut and raw format that we used to experience.

To summarise, it's clear that British Business TV has moved away from its frosty seriousness and raw reality towards a scripted, self-deprecating, reality-comedy model. I think this model will soon (if it hasnt already) become stale and unappealing (much like love island after the early seasons where they stopped people drinking and people just started coming on for z-list influencer status). I believe there is and will be a huge gap and audience for a raw-style reality tv show for a business/entrepreneurship competition with genuinely talented candidates and realistic tasks. I think it would be great for the image of British business and entrepreneurship.  Maybe this is something that we will be (or already have been (I haven't done much to check)) blessed with via the freemarket of YouTube and smaller media creators. Until then, I guess the whoopsie daisy point and laugh entertainment we call a competition amongst ""Britains best entrepreneurs"" will have to suffice. 

  
Mashed this out after a coffee and felt like I wanted to rant about my dissatisfaction with the current format. Would love to hear other peoples opinions or suggestions for shows that might scratch the itch I'm describing. Until next time (where we will be mutually berrating the incompetence of a candidate in the comment section of the weekly megathread). ",5,1740138174.0,apprenticeuk,0,1.0,False

Right when the sun hit the waterline in the distance 

When moon shone on the other side

And the rose colored clouds dusted the orange sky

She was sitting on the edge of the dock, back bent, staring into the horizon 

I watched her from the shore 

thinking of everything that has happened from then and now 

How much she‚Äôs grown 

Molded into conformity from broken down pride into what I am tonight

And I hate who I am tonight 

So I admire her from a distance 

This is her before she was broken in 

Before she shaped into society 

Before she abided by the rules 

I follow demands now

I keep my head down and say yes sir and yes maam 

And there she was before obideience was drilled into the back of her mind

When she spent most her time suspended for reading books in math class and walking into the wrong bathrooms 

She wore a buzz cut and black nails and profanity written on the soles of her shoes

Beside her a water bottle with a mix of scotch, whiskey, and bourbon and eye bags from sneaking out the night before 

And I envied that way of life 

I have a job now and a car to pay for 

I have plans for the future and a boy to spend the rest of my life with

I scrubbed the cuss words off my shoes and let my hair grow out 

And I despise the current version of me 

I‚Äôve beaten down pride and melted to mold I was always told to be 

The quiet and peaceful girl they always wanted for me 

And after a while, she stands

begins to walk away from the edge of the dock

And when we make eye contact 

There is no recognition 

No hello 
no hug 
no apology

I smile and she nods 

and she passes me by

Part 1,"It was a nice day outside, even if the temperature was a little lower than I would have liked. I looked back at my little dog, a shaggy, blonde terrier mix with dewy brown eyes and the most adorable underbite I have ever seen in my life.

‚ÄúFine. I'll grab my coat.‚Äù I grumbled, leaving the word document open on the small laptop sitting on the coffee table.

His tail began to wag wildly as I stood ad moved toward the closet where my coat, and his harness were stored. I strapped the device onto his little body and attached the leash. I pulled my hooded sweatshirt over my head. I also grabbed a beanie, pulling that down over my ears. I grabbed the leash and a ball from its place on the counter as I walked out the front door. I locked he deadbolt and then the knob before letting Ben take the lead. He knew exactly where we were going and sniffed the ground excitedly as he gently pulled me forward.

We arrived at the dog park, and my puppy sat patiently at the gate until I opened it. Once inside, and the swinging barrier was secured behind me I released Ben from his leash and threw the ball, watching him chase it as it bounced over the short-cropped grass. He managed to grab the toy and ran back toward me at full speed. I crouched down and put my hand out accepting the slobbery sphere from my pet. I threw it again and again until the little canine began to slow down. We hung around for a while, until a couple entered the park with their big dogs.

I leashed my animal and exited the gate, though I wasn't quite ready to return home. I took a right at the intersection instead of immediately heading home. As I approached the small store a few blocks away, I noticed a large amount of flyers stapled to one of the telephone poles that lined the street. Each one read 'Lost Pet', with an image of a different animal on each printed sheet of paper. There were several small dogs, cats, a turtle and a ferret among those missing. I felt my heart break a little bit as I looked down at my own animal.

He let out a quiet huff and shifted back and forth on his front paws.

‚ÄúI know, buddy.‚Äù I said and then gently tugged the leash.

I entered the store and exchanged pleasantries with the clerk, a woman who had actually dated me for a time in high school. She came around the counter and squatted down to pet Ben's head. The dogg wagged his tail and pressed into her touch, huffing and puffing happily, his eyes sparkling as he soaked up the attention.

‚ÄúHe's so damn cute. I fall in love with Ben every time you guys come in.‚Äù Amanda said as I walked back up the aisle with a bottle of soda in my hand.

‚ÄúYou could always come meet us at the dog park sometime.‚Äù I replied, digging my wallet from my pocket as I spoke.

She smiled and scanned the item, and exchanged money.

‚ÄúI might just do that. You still have the same phone number?‚Äù she replied, her tone bordering between playful and flirtatious. I paused for an awkward moment, then nodded my head, gently tugging at the leash to let Ben know that it was time to go.

‚ÄúI do. Text me, or something.‚Äù I said quietly, voice lowering to a near mumble, my anxiety kicking in slightly.

‚ÄúOkay. Have a nice day!‚Äù she called.

I was already outside. I hurried back to my home and as I passed the telephone pole I tried to avert my eyes from the amount of posters. It didn't work. I stood there examining them for a few very long minutes. I twisted the lid from the fizzy, citrus flavored drink that I had purchased and took a quick gulp from the bottle before replacing the cap. We walked back to my home, where I quickly opened the two locks, securing them behind me once I was inside. I freshened up Ben's water and food and then went about removing my dog's harness.

I assembled a sandwich for myself and sat in front of my television to eat, surfing through the channels as I bit into the bread, meat and cheese in my other hand. I paused on a news broadcast, the subject of which was missing pets in another town not far from where I was living.

‚ÄúSome owners suspect some sort of trafficking ring, while others have much stranger beliefs.‚Äù the anchor said as a sort of wrap up to the story.

The way they phrased that caught me off guard. I opened the laptop computer on my coffee table and started checking a few neighborhood groups that I belonged to. I found that small animals had been going missing on the block over as well. I also fell down a pretty deep rabbit hole about animal organ harvesting. Every article I read furthered the anxiety I had been feeling since I saw all of the flyers earlier. I couldn't bring myself to watch any of the videos that had disclaimers about graphic content. I eventually managed to look away when Ben made a soft barking noise.

I let him go out into the fenced back yard, and went to the refrigerator, grabbing a carton of juice, pouring myself a glass. I sipped at it as I watched my dog playing in the back yard, racing in little circles after answering nature's call against the base of one of the pine trees near the wooden plank fence. As I stood there, smiling, my thoughts turned dark. What if the next pet to come up missing was mine? I walked to the door and peered outside.

‚ÄúBen. Come on, buddy.‚Äù I said, my voice casual.

The little dog didn't hesitate, wagging his tail and jogging back inside. I crouched down and tousled the mop of slightly shaggy fur between his floppy ears gently.

‚ÄúGood boy.‚Äù I said.

He grinned up at me and moved his head to lick the palm of my hand. I surfed through the channels for a while again, settling on a re-run of an old sitcom, returning to my research, checking the groups I had visited a while before. There were no new posts and I tried to put the strange occurrences out of my mind. It worked for a while as I focused on the antics of the faux family on the screen. My eyes started to close. I dozed for a while, kind of drifting in and out of sleep. Ben's shrill bark startled me back to reality.

‚ÄúWhat is it, buddy?‚Äù I asked, wiping at my eyes and pushing myself upright. From there I stood up and followed the little canine who walked quickly to the front door.

As I approached, I could hear other dogs barking outside. I looked down at my pet.

‚ÄúStay.‚Äù I told him. The dog let out a disagreeable grumble.

I opened the door and stepped out onto the porch, closing the door behind me. I started to step forward and then paused, turning and locking the deadbolt behind me. I turned back and continued out to the sidewalk. The night was alive with barks and howls of varying lengths and pitches. It was so noisy that it even drowned out the crickets and small frogs that usually serenaded the neighborhood at this time of night. I looked around, and saw a few other people coming out of their houses.

‚ÄúWhat's going on?‚Äù Bob, an older man who taught middle school math called out from his front yard.

‚ÄúYour guess is as good as mine.‚Äù I answered, raising my voice to be heard over the other commotion.

The howling and barking intensified for a moment and then all at once it stopped. All of us stood there, dumbfounded as the soft chirping of the crickets filled the sudden silence. After a few awkward moments I turned and walked back into my home. Ben was sitting obediently by the door and I rewarded him with a treat. He ran off with that and jumped up onto my bed to gnaw on it. I made myself a rudimentary dinner, carrying that to the couch with me. I cleaned up and was about to head to bed, when I decided to check the neighborhood groups.

I was not surprised to find out that while all the racket was happening, there was a report of another pet going missing. The next day, there was a new flyer on the telephone pole. The address was only a block away. The dog in the photo was one I recognized, a sweet, energetic little Jack Russel that played with Ben at the little dog park from time to time. I felt my heart break again. My grip on my dog's leash tightened subconsciously. I hurried back to the house and locked myself in. I spent a little time throwing Ben's toy down the hallway for him until he got tired.

The little mutt joined me on the couch, and fell asleep with his jaw resting on my thigh while I let the images on the screen distract me. I had to work the next day, and as such I carefully slipped out from under my little creature's head. He continued snoring, ears and paws barely twitching when I moved. I shaved the slightly longer than stubble growth on my face and then washed up. By the time I stepped out of the shower, Ben was sitting outside of the bathroom door. He whimpered and pawed at my shin with one leg.

‚ÄúGive me a second, I need to get dressed.‚Äù I told him.

One of his floppy ears raised slightly, and his head cocked as if he was absorbing my words as I moved past him and grabbed a pair of sweatpants and a long-sleeved t-shirt.

‚ÄúAlright, come on if you have to potty.‚Äù I said and the dog wasted no time following me to the back door.

I stood in the doorway, watching for anything suspicious while Ben made his rounds and did his business. As soon as he finished, I called him inside, and locked the door behind us once again. After a while, I went to bed, and my little companion hopped up next to me. It didn't take long for either of us to drift off to sleep while I laid there, running my fingers through his soft, warm fur. Once again, his sharp yapping roused me from my slumber.

I sat bolt upright, my adrenaline already flowing as I scrambled out from under the blankets and sheet. I hit the light switch and shoved my feet into my shoes. Ben followed me to the front door, and I turned, crouching down to his level.

‚ÄúStay inside, buddy, okay?‚Äù I pleaded.

He sat, seeming to understand me once again. I left the house, making sure to secure both locks behind me this time. Once again, I was not the only one outside. Bob was on the sidewalk, holding a baseball bat. The dogs on our block were losing their minds once again, and then a different sort of racket split the night. A dog was fighting something. Bob, myself and a few other men rushed in the direction of the noise. By the time we reached the correct yard, however, the owner was standing there, shining a flashlight on a small pool of blood.

‚ÄúDid you see what happened?' Bob spoke up.

‚ÄúNo, I just saw Dugger being dragged over the fence. Whatever grabbed him was strong, and fast.‚Äù the distraught middle-aged man who had just lost his pet replied in a semi-shocked monotone.

‚ÄúMaybe we should see if it left a trail.‚Äù one of the others offered.

‚ÄúIt would be no good in the middle of the night.‚Äù the man holding the bat took the lead, everyone's attention turning to him. ‚ÄúIf anyone wants to help I'll meet you on the corner at four thirty tomorrow afternoon. Bring flashlights and bats or whatever blunt weapons you can find.‚Äù he added.

A few people nodded and then the group broke up. I went back home and laid back down. Ben curled up beside me and I spent a long time just petting him. Getting back to sleep that night was impossible. I did end up calling in to work, pretending to be ill. I fell asleep a while after that. I woke in the early afternoon to Ben's whining. I let him into the back yard, standing on the top step until he started trotting back toward the doorway. I locked the door behind us and then messed around on the internet. I ended up finding a few more articles about missing pets in the local area.

I had to stop, the edginess I had been feeling for the past few days becoming unbearable. Suddenly my home felt claustrophobic. I grabbed the leash and Ben rushed to my side. I put on his harness and connected the lead. The little dog seemed surprised when we turned in the direction opposite that of the dog park. I was hoping for a nice, peaceful walk, but that dream was shattered when I saw the sheer amount of flyers on one of the telephone poles. It was in that moment I decided that even if no one else showed up, I would go with Bob.

I wanted to get to the bottom of whatever was going on, and of course, to keep my pet safe.

‚ÄúCome on, boy.‚Äù I said gently, tugging at my little friend's leash and he started walking with me again.

We paused so he could sniff at a small patch of grass and I looked away out of habit when he lifted his leg. Once his business was finished, even the dog seemed eager to get back into the house. I checked my e-mail, relieved to find nothing important. My eyes repeatedly strayed to the clock, and just as four o'clock rolled around, I opened the closet where my old sports equipment was stored and shifted things around until I found the old aluminum bat, wrapping my fingers around the handle , carrying that with me as I walked to the door.

I am running low on time, so I will have to end this story here, but I will explain what happened that night in my next post.",1,1740137328.0,u_OutlawWriter,0,1.0,False

Particularly with the wife. She's getting frustrated because she feels like what she has to say isn't important, and I'm not being patient enough for her own struggles when she has to really think about how she wants to say something (fibro fog).

The problem im having is she doesn't seem to understand how frustrating it is having to physically limit myself when I've already understood what she has said, processed it, and either moved on to an action for it or resume the action that she had interrupted. She just expects me to ""work on it"", but every time it happens it gets more frustrating and more difficult.

For example, I offered to make her a coffee this morning, and needed to get to the fridge to get milk for her. She was stood in front of the fridge, and when I asked her to move so that I could get the milk, she said she hadn't finished talking. I could not wait for her to move, and practically ran the three steps I needed to take when she eventually did move.

1iuojf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdultSelfHarm/comments/1iuojf2/im_just_tired_is_being_clean_really_worth_all/,I'm just tired. Is being clean really worth all this work?,"  I have a history of self harm, and in the recent past I have successfully managed to cut it down(haha.) to sporadic instances instead of making it a regular occurence. Even so I'm still plagued(like 4 times a week) with intense urges that leave me ""paralyzed"" for hours in an effort to stop myself from physically hurting myself. 

  My current crisis averting process looks like this:   
1. Something triggers me to get an itense, detailed urge to self harm.  
2. As soon as I recognize it I go straight to bed and curl up on top. I keep myself there until I can trust myself to not beeline for the tools as soon as I get up. This usually takes about 2 hours.   
3. Engage in pleasurable distractions(ex: anime, youtube, web novels, iced coffee, diet coke) until my mood is coaxed back to ""normal""(how it was before the trigger). This usually takes about 6-8 hours.

  It works. This is probably the longest I've gone without self harming. The problem, is that this ""crisis plan"" takes too long. Once the urge hits, an entire afternoon is *wasted* on just geting back on track. An afternoon that could have been spent on getting work done, job searching, studying. Doing regular young adult activities. Being productive.  Even doomscrolling would be a better use of time than this.

  I feel stupid trashing a colouring book page with cheap dollar store markers, or abusing styrofoam balls from the art supply store, or planning a spa day in the immediate future so that having an open wound would be super inconvenient. Just to keep myself-a grown ass man btw-from hurting my body in a fit of despair/anger/frustration! I don't want a sticker for ""not deliberately hurting myself"" or ""keeping a clean streak"". I'm physically and emotionally tired all the time. I'm drained. I want to not have to deal with this. I want myself to stop acting up, stop being so dramatic&uncooperative, stop being so emotional.

I hadn't met his owner/Mum until the end of the sit, but she drove me to the station, and we chatted on the drive over.

This morning I wake up to a text from her asking me if I wanted to come over for dinner and a movie, with a kiss (x) at the end of the message. Which sounds like she's asking me on a date, right? She's a similar age to me, and very attractive, but I didnt mention that I was a lesbian at any point in our conversation. I immediately screenshot and send to my friends, who tell me I should clarify that it was definitely meant for me. The following exchange happens:

Me: thank you so much for the offer, I just wanted to check that was meant for me?

Her: of course it was xx

Her: your picture looks just like my friend [name]'s!

Her: so sorry! You're welcome to come if you'd like, but I know you're not very local. 

I'm not sure why she mentions her friend, but I don't want it to seem like I'm not interested, so I text back not to be sorry, and that maybe we can meet up next week, which she agrees to. I then remember that she works in my city a few days a week, so ask if she's working here, and if she'd like to go for coffee.

It's at this point that two of my friends point out that between the 'of course it was xx' and the message mentioning her friend, she must have realised that she was actually texting the wrong person. She mentions her friend because that's who she thought she was texting, and that's why she apologised, which is not how my autistic ass had interpreted those messages. 

So I'm massively embarrassed, and let her know that I've realised my mistake. She says she'd wanted to suggest a meet up when she'd dropped me at the station, but had gotten embarrassed and didn't ask, so coffee would be great. I don't know if she means that, or if that's her trying to save face, but omg the rollercoaster I've been on this morning! Really thought I was getting asked out by an attractive woman with a cute dog for a hot minute there üò≠",10,1740135932.0,actuallesbians,2,1.0,False

	‚Ä¢	WooCommerce (WordPress) is free but requires hosting costs.

3. Sell via Direct Email & Social Media
	‚Ä¢	Use an email list (ConvertKit, Mailchimp) and sell directly.
	‚Ä¢	Offer discounts or limited-time bonuses to increase conversions.
	‚Ä¢	Use Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok to drive traffic.

4. Sell on Digital Marketplaces (Non-KDP)

	‚Ä¢	Payhip ‚Äì 5% (free plan), 2% (plus plan), 0% (pro plan).
	‚Ä¢	Sellfy ‚Äì 0% transaction fee on paid plans.
	‚Ä¢	E-Junkie ‚Äì Flat monthly fee (good for handling affiliates).

5. Sell via Subscriptions or Bundles
	‚Ä¢	Offer Patreon, Substack, or Buy Me a Coffee to sell your book as part of a subscription.
	‚Ä¢	Create a bundle with related digital products (worksheets, videos, courses).

I've always been a sleepy person and found it easy to nap, but recently I'm finding that I can sleep all the time, any time, anywhere. Like it doesn't matter if I have a 2 hour nap during the day, cause I will still be able to go to sleep at 9:30pm every night. If I'm a pssenger in the 30 minute car ride it takes to go to get groceries, I will sleep. If I'm sat or laid down for more than 20 minutes I will sleep. And getting/waking up is very difficult to do. I do shifts on a dairy farm so I'm working from 5am-8am and from 4pm-6pm. And like clock work, I'm in bed most nights by 9pm.

I eat a regular diet, try to stay away from alcohol as much as possible, and have stopped smoking. Sometimes, I find that if I drink coffee, it does the complete opposite of making me more awake and actually sends me to sleep.

Is me being this tired a side effect? Is my dosage too high? Is there anything I can do to change this?",1,1740135790.0,prozac,2,1.0,False

Just wanted to swing by and throw in my two cents about my experience ‚Äì spoiler alert: it's nothing but positive vibes. üåü From day one, Raw has been my go-to, and honestly, they've checked every box on my list, and then some. Even as they've grown, they've stayed true to what made them great in the first place. So, let's break it down:

Price üí∏: Top-notch, can‚Äôt beat it. Seriously, I‚Äôve spent less on my morning coffee than what I get from Raw, and guess what? Raw delivers far more value. It‚Äôs like finding a golden nugget in your pocket.

Quality üèÜ: Always on point. I‚Äôm not here for anything subpar, and Raw gets it right every single time. No weird aftertaste, no mystery ingredient you can‚Äôt pronounce ‚Äì just pure, premium quality.

Dosage üíØ: Every scoop hits just right. Precision in every batch. No guessing games, just solid consistency that I can rely on with my eyes closed.

Customer Service üí¨: Monique and the team? Absolute rockstars. If there‚Äôs ever an issue (which is rare), they‚Äôve got my back like a friend who brings the right snacks to a road trip. Prompt, helpful, friendly ‚Äì truly a dream team.

Freebies with Every Gram üéÅ: Who doesn‚Äôt love a good freebie? Raw's been generous with that extra touch, which shows they really care about the customer experience.

Now, I know there have been some chatter around other lab allegations, but honestly, none of that adds up for me. I‚Äôve been loyal to Raw, and I trust them completely. They take the necessary steps to ensure their products are top-quality and safe before they leave the facility ‚Äì and I‚Äôm here for it.

In short, Raw doesn‚Äôt just meet expectations, they exceed them. If you're on the fence about trying them, I can confidently say: go for it. Cheers to Monique and the crew for keeping it real! üôå

1iuo9vt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iuo9vt,Is this a scam?,"My partner recently dropped coffee on her m1 air laptop. I opened it up earlier this week to clean the internals and to ensure there was no damage to any of the boards. I had to also take off a few keys from the keyboard as they were sticky, to clean under them.
While reassembling everything, I accidentally broke two of the key hooks that hold them in place. These were the ""c"" key and the ""spacebar"" key. As they would not sit correctly anymore, I had to turn to eBay to get spare keys.
I found a seller A with 100% positive reviews with just over a 100 reviews to buy the ""c"" key from. The listing did not show that he had the ""spacebar"" key so I sent him the message asking if he sold it, having already bought the ""c"" key. 
In the mean time I found seller B selling the ""spacebar"" key and went ahead and bought it from them. 

Seller A responded back later saying that he indeed sold the spacebar key and sent me the listing number for the same. I thanked him, and said I might buy it from him soon. This is because installing the spacebar key is quite hard, and I reckoned that I would break the replacement too. 

The two parcels from each seller came last night. Seller A's parcel had the ""c"" key and the ""spacebar"" key with a note asking me to take my time fixing the ""spacebar"" key as it hard, and wishing me luck. I did not order the ""Spacebar"" key from them. But I found it very sweet that they sent me a note and the Spacebar key presumably for free. I was going to message them sometime today to ask if I could pay for the spacebar key as well, because it felt like it was the right thing to do. So now I had 2 Spacebar keys, 1 from Seller A and 1 from B. And I thought I would just resell the unused one and let it be.
 But today morning seller A messaged me asking me to buy the ""spacebar"" key because he sent it with the other key. And this felt like a scam? I did not buy the key, but they sent it anyway and now expect payment? 
I thought of just returning the key, but the postage is ¬£2 for a ¬£5 key. What are my options? Should I pay the seller the full price and resell? Should I return the key and take the ¬£2 loss, or should I raise a ticket with eBay?

I know the monetary value isn't high, but something about this did not feel right, which is why I am posting this here.

1iuo7l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iuo7l4/aita_for_doing_this/,AITA for doing this?,"Warning! Long text. A story about my relationships.

Me (27F) and my boyfriend (26M) have been together for almost 10 years. I decided to break up with him because he was very abusive and I was honestly scared of him. I would get breathing issues (hyperventilation) when I was around him. In general I didn‚Äôt feel safe in that relationship. I still loved him very much or I thought I might be trauma bounded with him after some research, and that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt leave the relationship for so long, especially that we lived in a different country, and I was codependent on him with many things. 

I finally, made my decision to leave the relationship, and move back to my homeland. It was honestly the hardest decision that I have ever made, especially, to leave someone I was so deeply in love. 

I sold and donated majority of my stuff since I liked the minimalistic lifestyle. So I was left with my luggage and other stuff that I left at our home. 

I remember the last days before leaving him. I was absolutely emotionally numb, so I was able to stay cold and follow my plan. I left.

I moved back to my parents, and I thought that my life was over. I didn‚Äôt think I could ever recover from this. 

I couldn‚Äôt move on, so I saved some money, and booked an ayahuasca retreat. My main goal was to let go of the love I had for him. 

My sessions were difficult. During the second session I was still saying that nothing helps, and I still loved him very much, and was almost shouting inside. In that moment I became his mum (under the psychedelic affect), and could see her point of view, and how much love she has for her children. This way I was able to express all the love that I had, and left it there. I was able to let it go. It still took me time to integrate but it definitely helped me a lot to move on. 

Months go by and my life starts to get better, and I start to get glimpses of not being depressed. I honestly never thought it is possible to feel this way. It could also be an effect of me starting to drink coffee from time to time. What‚Äôs important that I slowly started to get excited about my life and my future.

Me and my best friend decided to travel around Europe, and while travelling I‚Äôve met this guy. We‚Äôve spend like three days together, and I liked him but I knew he was a walking red flag. Yet I still fell for him. During the trip he kissed me, and after that I told him that we can‚Äôt talk ever again (it‚Äôs probably due to my avoidant attachment style).

But we still spent some time together the next day. I was definitely attracted to him, and he was doing everything to have ‚Äòsomething‚Äô with me but I stopped him, and told him that I still would feel like I would be cheating, so nothing else happened between us. We still kept chatting after the trip since we were both living in different countries, and he wanted to come to my country to meet me but I rejected this offer because I knew he was a red flag and just wanted to sleep with me. I wanted to meet him but I was afraid to get attached to him. 

He started breadcrumbing me while chatting, and it was really addictive to me. I knew it wasn‚Äôt healthy but I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him. Every time he would text me I would get extreamly excited, and wanted to respond immediately but I was trying to wait bc he was doing that. Breadcrumbs are very addictive. Those who tried to move on from such situationships/relationship knows how hard it can be. I‚Äôve read some posts on Reddit from people who went through this, and some people get stuck in this situation for years.

At this point I feel like I fully moved on from the previous relationship, and now am stuck in this situationship. My ex boyfriend decided to break no contact, and contacted me. He told me that he regrets the way he treated me, and can‚Äôt forgive himself for losing me. It‚Äôs because he found my diary, and realised how much I loved him.

He seemed to be in a lot of pain, and I didn‚Äôt want him to be. He wanted to see me, and at first I rejected that, and said that it‚Äôs not a good idea but he was at such a low point that I agreed to meet. We drank some tea and spoke about how life was going for us. He seemed to be better in the middle of the break up but now he was surprised to see me getting better because when he was ok I was still completely broken.

I told him about my ayahuasca experience and about my trip around Europe. He then told me that he slept with two women, and I was quite surprised but didn‚Äôt really have feelings for him, so I was kind of ok but was just really surprised because I used to be his first and only one. 

He seemed to be really sad, you could see that he was hurting, so we hugged and cuddled a little. I wanted him to feel better. Yet I already had feelings for another person. 

After that, he started texting me more often as he was really hoping to get me back. I was replying to him, and we were talking. He clearly wanted to get me back but I told him that I don‚Äôt think that we are compatible (what he used to say), and that I wouldn‚Äôt be ready for a relationship again because I already had feelings for someone else.

I said that we should go no contact again, and he agreed. Even though, he was at an extremely low point. We stopped chatting again but after some time (maybe a week later) he still texted me saying that he will never forgive him for letting me go. He also said, that already for some time he was having horrible nightmares related to being alone, and remembering me. After he would wake up he would realise that I‚Äôm not next to him and that he was in a horrible emotional pain. He could even barely sleep. 

I felt really bad for that, I couldn‚Äôt see him in such pain, so I started chatting again. He said he would do everything to get back together, even if it would take long time for my feelings to return. I didn‚Äôt want to go back to this relationship but I couldn‚Äôt leave him in such pain.

We continued chatting, and I told him that if I would come back to this relationship, and if I would like to feel fair in it I would also need to sleep with two guys as he did with two woman. He obviously rejected this idea, and he said that he doesn‚Äôt want to give me to anyone. 

He also was hardly able to accept the fact that I had feelings for another guy but he said he was willing to wait as long as he will need for me to forget this guy, and return back feelings for him.

Time goes by, and we started to be in a relationship again. At first, I was pretty cold. He would tell me that he loves me, and I wasn‚Äôt even able to say it back. I was feeling guilty for that, so after some time I started replying that I love him too.

Yet I was still obsessively thinking about that other guy which I know is very toxic, and I had a feeling that he have hurt a lot of women (emotionally) before bc he have slept with many of them (he told me that). He seemed to be an absolute player who breadcrumbs and switches between people (which I assumed) since he would be gone for weeks or even months. Yet he was always coming back even after a long disappearance, and it would make me hard to resist not to text him back.

At this point my now boyfriend asked me not to chat with other guys, so I ignored this guy‚Äôs messages, and he started to text me more. He was asking why I was ghosting him, and after some time I messaged him back by saying that we can no longer talk because I got back to my boyfriend, and he asked me not to chat with other guys. I also told him that I will still miss him.

He ignored me for some time. Maybe a month later he texted that he misses me, and had a dream about me that night. To which I responded that I don‚Äôt believe what he‚Äôs saying and he‚Äôs just playing games with me. He said that he was not playing, and he truly missed me to which I haven‚Äôt respond.

After some time, as always, he texted me asking how am I. To which I responded ‚ÄòHi, I‚Äôm good‚Äô not even asking how he was. He then said something, and I told him to stop texting me. He then said that he enjoyed spending time together. To which I replied me too, and I told him that he was playing with me all along, and it upset me. To which he said he didn‚Äôt play, and I haven‚Äôt replied to this message.

Couple months go by, and I was starting to think about him less and less. 

Now at the end of this January, couple months later, he texts me asking how am I. I got a glimpse of excitement when I saw his text to which I said I‚Äôm ok, and I hoped he‚Äôs too. Then he asked me if I wanted to text him at least once during this time, and I said no, bc I‚Äôm with my boyfriend now, which is true, I was never planning to text him first since I‚Äôm in a relationship now. We chatted for a week with long pauses. We spoke about morality, and I told him that it‚Äôs inappropriate for me to chat with him because I‚Äôm in a relationship. I then asked him to stop playing with me, and used sad emoji and repeated that we can‚Äôt chat, and said multiple times to stop texting me. He still messaged me saying that he would like to meet. To which I said we clearly can‚Äôt. We still had some conversations about morals and values during which I was responding cold and was not trying to engage the chat too much. He kept texting me, so I ignored him, and I decided to block him. After that I felt a lot better because I knew he could never reach out ever again. I also ignored him which in a way satisfied me but blocking him was the main thing that helped me to finally let him go.

At this point I already developed feelings for my now boyfriend, and am missing him, since we are in a long distance relationship atm but I was supposed to move to another country to be back with him this month.

Now he found out about my interactions with this other guy, and he couldn‚Äôt believe that I was ‚Äòcheating‚Äô on him by secretly chatting with this guy when we are in a full time relationship. He was extremely upset and angry. He said that he wants to end things between us and blocked me everywhere. Later unblocked me, and he couldn‚Äôt believe that I ‚Äòcheated‚Äô on him. We were talking, and I was dissociating, I had no feelings at all since I have quiet bpd. I was protecting myself from my overwhelming emotions for my own survival at that time.

To be honest, I didn‚Äôt even feel too bad replying to this guy because I felt unfair from the beginning of this relationship because my boyfriend slept with two women, and rejected me to do the same. I know that we were technically separated but it still made me upset. I couldn‚Äôt imagine him doing something with someone else while I wasn‚Äôt able to do that bc I still felt like I would be cheating even after a long time after we broke up. I felt betrayed, and extremely unfair, and in my mind I justified my action of answering text messages to the guy I was trying to end things with. Honestly, those messages let me leave my thoughts in the chat instead of in my head.

Now, when I finally seemed to be able to let go of the feelings for this guy, and started to attach, and have feelings for my boyfriend again he sais that he wants to break up with me, and accusing me of cheating.

Now after his reaction I felt like the worst person in the world and didn‚Äôt even want to exist anymore. My life seemed to be too complicated and hard to live.

My boyfriend said that he will tell everyone that I‚Äôm a cheater, and later told me to do it myself. I was in such a panic attack, and was scared that I will do something to myself, so I called my dad bc he had a history of cheating. I told him shortly the situation that I cheated, and that I don‚Äôt know how to deal with the guilt. Now I feel a bit awkward that I told that to my dad. I feel like I had to keep this personal information to myself but I was just on the edge at that time, and needed someone to talk to.

Now my boyfriend seemed to understand that he took me from an active situationship, and I needed time to recover from it, and I needed to have some conversations with that other guy to fully move on.

I really apologised to him for keeping it a secret, and as a result hurting him. I felt to have the right to answer this guy‚Äôs texts because I still didn‚Äôt think it was worse than him sleeping with those two women. Technically, I am guilty, and he didn‚Äôt do anything wrong because we were not together at that time. Even though, I told him before entering the relationship that I was not ready for it, and I attempted to end it but he still convinced me to start again. As I mentioned before, he also rejected my condition to sleep with two guys for me to feel fair again. Now after all this I am left guilty and a cheater. I‚Äôm not a stone I need time to adjust with my feelings. He knew that.

I honestly think that from my side it was more than love to come back to this relationship when I finally moved on, and did have feelings for another person. Especially that I didn‚Äôt feel safe in this relationship as he used to be really abusive. Leaving this relationship in a first place was the hardest decision I have ever made in my life, and now coming back after a year gap was a very difficult decision.

Now after all this I am left being guilty, and am ashamed of myself to the point where I just want to isolate from people and stop existing. Should I really beat myself so much for this?

I've been an awful sleeper for basically my whole life, but it's never been this bad. Naps were usually there to save me if I needed them, but they've become so difficult. I don't exactly know what I'm asking here, I guess any advice would be great. I mean, I know what I'm supposed to do, things I'm supposed to tweak about my lifestyle, my habits, so on and so forth. I've already cut back significantly on coffee/caffeine, I don't eat in bed at all, I hardly look at my phone in bed, I try to keep it as a place that's only for sleep. I take two magnsium pills and two max strength melatonin every night just to feel tired. But feeling tired obviously doesn't guarantee sleep whatsoever. I can't shut my fucking brain off. I want to avoid drugs but my god, I'm not sure I have a choice anymore. I'm seeing my family doctor about this finally, but the appointment isn't for another month. I get angry and go insane in the middle of night, over the sounds of cars, street sweepers, snow ploughs, etc. I don't know if I can handle another month, I'm reaching the end of my rope here.


Long backstory here. I had a pretty traumatizing breakup with my girlfriend of 4 years, on the morning of Christmas Eve 2022. Since then, I lived in my brother's tiny spare room in his apartment for 5 months before getting my own place. Having been in my own apartment for over a year and a half now, I thought for sure my ability to fall asleep would improve, but no such luck. I quit smoking last summer, as I was especially prone to smoking cigarettes in the evening, which can keep you up. I also quit drinking alcohol for the most part; I drink like once a month these days. Caffeine I've cut to just one cup early in the morning when I start work at 6:30am. I generally avoid caffeinated sodas. I've changed what I could within reason, but obviously there's lots more I could be doing. Smoke less weed or quit altogether, cut back on screen time in the evening, etc. But it's hard to keep cutting back or sacrficing all these little things when nothing ever changes. Like at all. It's my brain, it never stops. Can anyone tell me how to get my brain to please shut the fuck up? Should I just keep trying herbal teas, try stopping melatonin and trying again? I've done all this. I need quaaludes or some shit. I've had 3-4 hours of sleep a day, including any naps I've been lucky to manage, for nearly two weeks straight now, including weekends. I'm tired and I want to die. It's like my crippling depression and insomnia have finally decided to work in tandem and end me once and for all, by taking away my sanity and making me want to end it myself.

(Long haul business class on Lufthansa, Airbus A380 - malfunctioning water tanks)","Hello ladies and gents. As my title asks, I am wondering about any right to compensation in my case. I did a few searches but I didn't manage to find something related to this issue. Before I do any back and forth communication with Lufthansa, I thought maybe some knowledgeable people here could assist in my question.

Long story we did a long haul overnight flight from MUC Munich to BKK Bangkok 3 weeks ago (28th of Jan, LH772)  We are lucky enough to travel in business class (on the upper deck of the giant A380!), but our journey soon after takeoff took an unexpected turn. Quickly after using the onboard bathrooms the water faucets started shooting out water mist only. After a while, nothing. The crew told us it turned out the water pumps were broken. So that meant nobody on board this giant plane, regardless of seating, were able to wash their hands after each toilet use. We were also unable to get some basic amenities such as coffee tea or hot water to drink (at least there was champagne...), but the main issue here was the (lack of) hygiene for people after toilet visits, touching food, handles and spreading to surfaces on the plane. The crew started to apologize and some started reaching their hands through openings in the doors into the toilets with resuable drinking water bottles for passengers to use instead, so all kudos to them, but after 12 hours we landed and what was supposed to be a rather pleasant flight felt kind of disgusting and dilluted, to be frank. The captain apologized, but after landing I really felt the need for a shower and I dont exaggerate where it had an impact on my apetite, sad as it is with such food you're usually getting in a package like this.

I'm normally not too ""icky"" about stuff like this but I felt like it was kind of unacceptable. Am I out of line here when I think this expecting some form of compensation? I can perhaps understand this being dumb to think would be covered on a no frills Ryanair flight with a 1,5 hour duration, but this happening on a long haul trip where people pay up to ‚Ç¨10.000 for a return ticket on a flagship carrier does lay out a different set of expectations, at least I would be inclined to think so.

I'm not a coffee expert or anything but I quite like how coffee tastes. Problem is I'm very sensitive to caffeine so I'm in my late 30s and avoided coffee for my entire life thus far. 
I know a lot of people are basically dependent on coffee first thing in the morning, like my gf. Well, to save myself the grumpy starts I have started making her coffee as soon as I wake up. It's just easier. But I also like the smell and taste so have started trying decaf and it works alright. I still dont drink much. 

So next step is decaf in a moka pot and I'm now trying to figure out best practices and methods to make delicious hot decaf in the morning using a moka. 

I tried adding some lemon too with the grinds. I add like a quarter teaspoon of honey to the coffee instead of sugar for some sweetener. I have mixed with warm milk cold milk frothy milk etc. I've added some milo and chocolate to get more of a mocha chocolate coffee vibe. 

I'm looking for simple ways to improve the flavor and taste and experiment. 

Any tips you got I'll give it a try. 

I am also using an actual coffee filter paper after the moka is finished I pour it through a filter paper - gf has heart disease and moka pots funnily enough make coffee which has more saturated fats in the oils, so using a filter paper removes a lot of the oils. And i assume also then the caffeine? Barister friend told me the oil on the top of a perfect brew is where more caffeine is? No clue if that's true or not. 

Basically I'm a newbie. Thanks for any advice. 

Edit. I've also tried different temperatures of water before brewing. Cold and hot and luke warm. Honestly haven't noticed much difference? I've tried quicker and slower. Perhaps I'm so new to coffee that I just don't have the palate for subtle differences. I'm not sure.. ",3,1740134708.0,mokapot,4,1.0,False

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

One of the simplest yet most effective ways to keep your team sharp is by providing quality coffee in the office. But why does coffee help with focus? Let‚Äôs explore the science behind it.

**How Coffee Enhances Focus**

The primary reason coffee improves focus is its key ingredient‚Äîcaffeine. Caffeine is a natural stimulant that affects the brain by blocking adenosine, a neurotransmitter responsible for making you feel drowsy. By inhibiting adenosine, caffeine keeps you alert and awake, allowing you to stay focused on tasks.

Additionally, caffeine increases the production of dopamine and norepinephrine, two neurotransmitters associated with improved mood, motivation, and cognitive function. This combination helps employees stay engaged, process information faster, and complete tasks more efficiently.

**The Ideal Amount of Coffee for Productivity**

While coffee has significant benefits, moderation is key. Research suggests that consuming 200-400 mg of caffeine per day (about 2-4 cups of coffee) is the optimal amount to enhance focus without leading to jitters or crashes. Too much caffeine can cause restlessness, anxiety, or disrupted sleep, which can negatively impact work performance.

To maximize the benefits of coffee in the workplace, encourage employees to enjoy their first cup in the morning and another in the early afternoon, avoiding late-day caffeine intake that might interfere with sleep.

**The Role of Quality Coffee in the Workplace**

Not all coffee is created equal. A well-stocked office coffee station with **freshly brewed, high-quality coffee** can make a significant difference in employee satisfaction and productivity. Investing in a premium office coffee service ensures that your team gets the best flavors, variety, and convenience‚Äîwithout wasting time running to coffee shops.

I started eating all of my calories before >!12pm!<, and I usually eat my first meal of the day at about >!4 am!<. The rest of the time I drink coffee with zero calorie sweetener or water, sometimes diet soda. I just can‚Äôt stop crying because I don‚Äôt want to go back to eating so little every day, I don‚Äôt want to gain weight and I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing wrong. 

How do I cope with fluctuations? I feel so panicked and scared I just want to cut until I feel I‚Äôm at a safe number. I don‚Äôt know what my goal is nor what I want to be. I keep moving my goal lower and lower and I don‚Äôt feel satisfied at my current weight. ",1,1740134137.0,EDAnonymous,4,1.0,False

1iunwly,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyPL/comments/1iunwly/fpl_swiss_2024_25_stage_5/,FPL Swiss 2024 / 25 | Stage 5,"Good day, everyone!

We've come to the end of Stage 4, and there have been some interesting developments across all three Tiers. Have you survived, or have you thrived? Are you swindling, or are you dwindling? Are you out, or are you still in?

That's enough of that, let's crack on.

As usual, all past, and present, Stages can be found in the¬†[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/view?gid=1949867961).

EDIT: Somehow, I managed to take screenshots of the tables with premature Overall Ranks. Fortunately, it has not affected any outcomes as mentioned below... or unfortunately, depending on which side you sit.

# Stage 4 Round-up

# [Tier 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=208496951#gid=208496951)

**DIVISION 1**

*Scenarios:*

* ***\_13characters*** must avoid defeat to ***leosondek*** to claim the Tier 1 Stage 4 title, otherwise the latter takes the crown.
* ***theseane*** must beat ***Acrobatic\_Employ\_798*** and hope that ***leosondek*** also wins to claim the title via H2H.
* ***Acrobatic\_Employ\_798*** is fighting for survival only.
* ***Name19389*** has a good chance to win the Stage if ***leosondek*** and ***theseane***, as they hold the H2H advantage over both. Relegation survival is still a big threat.
* ***Fooicus*** will have to rely on H2H against whomever else loses. Other results still need to go their way for survival.

u/_13characters claimed a narrow win and that is enough to be crowned Tier 1 Stage 4 Champion.

u/theseane popped up with the highest score in this group, but it's only good enough to finish 2nd.

u/leosondek losing, puts them into what would turn out to be a 4-way H2H battle to survive Relegation. u/Fooicus winning, helps to include them in that 4-way.

Unfortunately, it's u/Acrobatic_Employ_798 and u/Name19389 who fall, with less wins against the others, and the go down to Division 2.

**DIVISION 2**

*Scenarios:*

* ***ZAK5UMA*** has a 100% win record, but a loss to ***Andrew643521*** means they swap places, with both gaining promotion to Division 1.
* ***StuartA19*** must beat ***FanFareApp*** to for a chance at Promotion if ***Andrew643521*** fails.
* For ***StuartA19***, q win could mean promotion, and a loss could spell Elimination from FPL Swiss.
* ***FanFareApp*** should be safe from Elimination.
* ***EpiKnightz*** only hope for survival is a win, as well as a loss for ***StuartA19***.
* ***larsriedel*** is eliminated.

u/ZAK5UMA secured the top spot after beating u/Andrew643521, who would have claimed it themselves.

u/StuartA19 lost out to u/FanFareApp, which means their Promotion hopes are dashed. It also put u/FanFareApp into a H2H against u/Andrew643521, but it was the latter who prevails.

u/EpiKnightz beat u/larsriedel at the bottom, which means the loser is Eliminated. For u/EpiKnightz, however, they go H2H v. u/StuartA19 and given the result in GW23, we must say farewell to u/StuartA19.

https://preview.redd.it/hcx62mz8tbke1.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=f35e31dddfb0a1257d10c02d9ff5cbb6d0aefbe0

**DIVISION 3**

*Scenarios:*

* ***Dioulio*** is guaranteed Promotion. Avoiding a loss will also secure the Division title.
* ***Justchillin1123*** must beat the current leader to secure Promotion, and that will also grasp the Title for them when they go head-to-head with ***Dioulio*** in the final match.
* A loss for ***Justchillin1123*** could be equally damaging, but it depends on whether ***JS794*** can win in the final match.
* ***soximent***, ***rdtalk*** and ***Vijaygarv*** are all eliminated.

u/Dioulio takes the essential win, beating the only score lower than them in this group, but it's all they needed to claim the Division 3 win.

u/Justchillin1123 lost that tie, but other results going their way means they are still safe from Elimination, and move up to Division 2.

u/JS794 lost to u/Vijaygarv meaning both are now Eliminated. and of course, we already knew that u/soximent and u/rdtalk were resigned to the same fate.

https://preview.redd.it/6d3fcgjatbke1.png?width=1888&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2112590d676fe398f950cd7cd6b4956d9dd8768

# [Tier 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=2077603926#gid=2077603926)

**DIVISION 1**

*Scenarios:*

* ***bb53040***, ***sparrowhawk73*** and ***coolBballer*** are all on 3x wins, all play individual matches, all on equal H2H par, and all on similar Overall Ranks as they all chase the Stage title.
* In the event that all 3x lose, and ***Long-Seaworthiness50*** wins, we will have a 4-way H2H for the title.
* ***wo27*** is desperately aiming to win and stay in the hunt for Stage 5 in the top Division, but it won't be easy.
* ***CardozoSmash*** is relegated.

u/bb53040, u/sparrowhawk73 and u/coolBballer were tied all ends up at the top of Tier 3, and incredibly, they all lost their individual matches, opening the door for u/Long-Seaworthiness50 to join the H2H party.

In the end, it is u/sparrowhawk73 who prevails as the victor.

Spoiler alert, the other three remain in Division 1.

That leaves u/wo27 and u/CardozoSmash in the depths of despair. Despite both winning, they have ultimately been excluded from the funnest party FPL has to offer, and are therefore both relegated to Division 2.

https://preview.redd.it/f5quenkbtbke1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=2df0e92f758c6d4106d2201a055f9800c0fdf7ad

**DIVISION 2**

*Scenarios:*

* ***Vegetable\_Design8330*** will take the top spot and earn Promotion.
* ***pa\_ra\_dox*** is favourite for the remaining Promotion place, but a win is still necessary to guarantee it, unless ***NielsRandomShirt*** v. ***QuantumParadox\_27*** finishes in a tie.
* ***FPLExpert*** must win against a Promotion-hopeful. Anything less and it's game over.
* ***DrainMember1312*** is Eliminated.

u/Vegetable_Design8330 was already guaranteed the top spot, so no surprises that they took time for some warm-weather training and relinquish a win to u/DrainMember1312.

u/pa_ra_dox earns a much-needed win to secure the remaining Promotion place, so up to Division 1 they go.

u/NielsRandomShirt beat u/QuantumParadox_27, effectively meaning nothing really changes in mid-table

With u/DrainMember1312 already Eliminated, it was all a matter of pride in the final GW, and they took that in spades. Unfortunately, that means u/FPLExpert will depart.

https://preview.redd.it/p7a9je7ctbke1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=df820d9945f595df73bbab2e44cab37c23353c70

**DIVISION 3**

*Scenarios:*

* ***FaustRPeggi*** has already secured the title-win.
* ***NoobyDoobyDoooo*** is a strong favourite for survival, unless they lose to ***FinnMundy7*** who can leapfrog to claim the remaining place.
* ***DiamondPalkia*** has a super-outside chance of survival but Overall Rank is not in their favour.
* ***IVIorgz*** and ***WEAluka*** are both eliminated.

u/FaustRPeggi takes the Division 3 title, largely unchallenged. In fact, there was only one GW where it was a close-call. Skill, or luck-of-the-draw? You decide.

u/NoobyDoobyDoooo unfortunately lost out to u/FinnMundy7, and so they change places, with the latter surviving Elimination and sending everyone else out of the competition.

It was always a long-shot for u/DiamondPalkia and that's how it ended, with a loss to already-Eliminated u/IVIorgz.

u/WEAluka finishes rooted to the bottom after 5x losses.

https://preview.redd.it/54aws3yctbke1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fa463a7e60631f6da8af2e6ad08bccfcd416c6e

# [Tier 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=675715524#gid=675715524)

**DIVISION 1**

*Scenarios:*

* ***thepalegreenpants*** leads Tier and a win will secure the title. Anything less and ***WaningCynicism*** will be keen to take advantage with a win.
* ***pauld95*** or ***Gloomy-Strawberry808*** could be relegated if ***Gilez\_89*** wins in the final match.
* ***docvampirina*** is relegated.

Heavy is the crown that wears the king!

A win for u/thepalegreenpants would have secure the Tier 3 Stage title, but they lost out to u/pauld95, allowing pretty much everyone else a chance to rise victorious.

Step up u/WaningCynicism against survival-hopeful u/Gloomy-Strawberry808 but alas, it wasn't to be. The latter wins, and remains in Division 1 instead.

This left us with a 3-way H2H rather than four - but none of that mattered as u/thepalegreenpants remained above the rest thanks to a draw in GW22. I guess you can open a door, but you can't force anyone to go through it.

Despite a win for u/Gilez_89 against u/docvampirina, other results sealed their fate, as both descend to Division 2.

https://preview.redd.it/zt7mepxdtbke1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d32d662fd6e9f7088363c40e5acc4149cc8f24b

**DIVISION 2**

*Scenarios:*

* ***\_LilDuck***, ***eglantinel***, and ***fusrohdab*** are tied on 3x wins going into the final GW.  Any of them can take the title.
* ***Mundanewisdom99*** can still throw their hat in the ring with a win, but will need those other results to favour them, but needs to survive Elimination. If they lose to ***Just7Callum***, they swap places.
* ***0ng0Gabl0g1an's*** Elimination is guaranteed.

Yet again, we have multiple managers heading into a dead-heat towards victory. The match that ultimately decided it was u/_LilDuck v. u/eglantinel, and the spoils went to the veteran who hangs in there a little longer.

That left u/_LilDuck licking their wounds as u/fusrohdab did what had to be done, and win to secure the second Promotion spot.

At the bottom, with two of the three staring down the barrel of Elimination, we already knew that u/0ng0Gabl0g1an was gone, and they finished on five losses.

That left the final match between u/Mundanewisdom99 and u/Just7Callum as the swansong for one of them. It was a well fought battle, that ended in a draw - 92 v. 92. You can pick a choose the cause and reason, or what could have been. A TC Salah for u/Mundanewisdom99 versus a regrettable benching for Mr. Honest-Days-Work, Raul Jiminez for u/Just7Callum, who needed to win to stay alive. Commiserations.

https://preview.redd.it/st4ynaoetbke1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7c2f6e4e294280826a34e11995097def8c05b10

**DIVISION 3**

*Scenarios:*

* ***macioman\_00***, ***FPL\_06***, and ***the\_Vegetabull*** are all on 3x wins, and only two Promotion / Survival spots to fight for. All tied on H2H, and all play individual matches in the final GW - potential for Overall Rank to decide it.
* If they all lose, and ***ShadowGallConcierge*** can win, it'll be a 4-way H2H battle.
* ***DasHotShot*** and ***dedosii*** are both Eliminated.

And so we once again reach the end of the line. We had another scenario where a 4-way H2H could decide the fate of many, and this time, it's for survival at the very bottom.

This time though, it was made a little easier to decipher as u/the_Vegetabull won their match, meaning they would indeed remain in the competition.

That left the last spot up for grabs, but with both of u/FPL_06 and u/macioman_00 failing to win, it's as if they simply don't pay enough respect to this tournament structure. Dang-it!

The saving grace for u/FPL_06 was that they didn't actually lose, tying with joint top scores in the group. It's enough, but only just.

u/ShadowGallConcierge failed to get the necessary win for survival, and bow out at this stage, joining u/DasHotShot and u/dedosii as they await the draw for the Consolation Cup.

# Stage 5

The tables and fixtures for Stage 5 are now ready. For those of you still alive-and-kicking, you can see who you're up against and plan accordingly.

Links to each Tier can be found at the bottom of this post.

If I have missed anything, or you've noticed something not quite right with the above, please do let me know as soon as I can as mistakes may not be able to be rectified in an ideal manner, if at all, once the GW starts.

# Champions Cup Qualifiers

With Stage 5 starting this weekend, it's the final chance to qualify for the Champions cup. In Stage 4, there were only two new Division winners, meaning that quite a few others have cemented their place in the draw. It's safe to say that managers with at least 2x Division wins will be involved from GW34.

As for the others, and those that have yet to qualify, now is your time to shine.

Let's have a look at who is involved, and who still needs to pull their finger out and get a move on.

u/ZAK5UMA is having a cracking season so far. Four Division wins, and sitting pretty at the top of the table, with notable mentions to u/Vegetable_Design8330, u/_13characters, and u/sparrowhawk73 all on 3x each.

We can also see the higher-ranked managers on 1x title win so far, and are also probably safe given their Overall Rank. A reminder, though, that it is the Overall Rank *at the end of GW30* that will be the deciding factor, but this should provide some foreshadowing until then.

https://preview.redd.it/bxr13p9wxgke1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f2ea04c875042852b44e81cc9bb49d07fdfeefc

In the bottom half of the table, those outside the Top 32 (and conveniently, around 1M+ Overall Rank) can still get there, even if they are already eliminated in a previous Stage. By improving their OR between now and GW30, there are no excuses.

https://preview.redd.it/yag4km2xxgke1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=f655a8d41025b3cbb71d639fe8c9be4c06fd00c3

There are also a few managers who have yet to win a Division title, but are still active in the FPL Swiss League, and given any title win will be their first, their Overall Rank will be a key factor in their chances:

* u/Fooicus \- Tier 1 Division 1 (**115k**)
* u/Justchillin1123 \- Tier 1 Division 2 (**1.2M**)
* u/FanFareApp \- Tier 1 Division 2 (**1.85M**)
* u/bb53040 \- Tier 2 Division 1 (**27.6k**)
* u/coolBballer \- Tier 2 Division 1 (**38k**)
* u/pa_ra_dox \- Tier 2 Division 1 (**500k**)
* u/CardozoSmash \- Tier 2 Division 2 (**376k**)
* u/NielsRandomShirt \- Tier 2 Division 2 (**518k**)
* u/QuantumParadox_27 \- Tier 2 Division 2 (**1.35M**)
* u/FPL_06 \- Tier 3 Division 2 (**542k**)
* u/Mundanewisdom99 \- Tier 3 Division 2 (**903k**)

Best of luck to everyone.

First post here. I've been obsessing over my grinder choice.
Currently have a Bambino Plus and a Varia VS3. The VS3 is going back under warranty. It doesn't hold its grind setting, like most VS3s from what I have now learned.
The Oro, DF64V and DF83 v2 are all basically the same price here in Australia at the moment.
I drink mostly macchiatos but also short black and latte. 
Mostly medium to medium-dark roast but I'm new to coffee and want to explore.
I, like I'm sure all people are, keen for a grinder that won't give me buyers remorse but also something that will provide great quality coffee and a great user experience. ",1,1740133685.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1iunr64,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_M_er_Askani/comments/1iunr64/theory_from_yesterdays_notes/,Theory from yesterday's notes,"Autismus-offset of balance of dopamine and cortisol. 
When there is a surplus of either substance in the body of a mother, baby in development copies said balances and treats them as their normal.
Example-high dopamine>baby's body does not feel the need to create as much dopamine. Volatile child.
-high cortisol-low affect, higher amount of dopamine needed to function, dependent. Is there an autistic somewhere in the middle? I mean if you smoke weed and you're constantly in stress there would be probably lot of both of them, which would be bad for the baby too. What would that mean? Depression and feeling of a profound disconnect, so overwhelming, high tolerance to drugs and high strung brain. -ozzy osbourne. 
Why are autistic people often from mixed pairs(race)? Is it a byproduct of a pancmitic mixing? 
By that theory there would be branches of autism stemming from different parts of the world, following disasters or stressfull situations or addicts. Is 90's honest culture created by the kids of hippies? 
Mutation? I mean yeah if you get two people where the symptoms of autism are recessive but the same within the pair ,and I think it is possible that could be a thing within everyone, that a woken up gene shows up in the next generation, it could mutate into a dominant gene and you have the fenotype.
Irish famine
Cold climate countries with lots of poor people.
Children of addicts, workoholics and alcoholics.
People eating traditional jewish quisine.
The hood-america, for some reason the projects thing seems to me like a very easy way for them to use people for experimenting on people with the substance and getting shit ton of money out of it plus addicted people. The only thing is lot's of them have abandonment issues practically by default now so instead of an autistic person you'll get a narc more likely. 
I could be wrong, but I have never met as much autistic people in my life as I have while working in fastfood.. It's almost ridiculous. I'm thinking maybe they are adding adenochrome to the food too. And it seems like all the food is exclusively containing fenolic acids. Even the corn and coffee, plus it's covered in butter. What about the sauces for rice? Imma take an empty bottle and take a look. It's like they're raising a...huhhh are they raising high functioning autistics on purpose? 
I mean, you need high cholesterol for your brain to work in that way...and pairing that with the fenolic acids, and adenochrome...hm? But raising autistic people on purpose and leaving them without guidance gives you chaos... why? Is it because when you combine it with the aminoacids the testoserone goes higher and you're more likely to have a boy if you're sexually active in that time? Well I know at least one person whom it worked for. And I guess now I know why cool balls are so important. Lol. 
Another thing I noticed is that similarly to the hood there is a significant amount of narcs in the indian gene pool. 
Presence of blood or sweat in the meat is something that my body does not take well, other than iron, b12 and a surplus of water solluble fiber, in each of them there is possibility of presence of a stress hormone in it. I'm more sensitive to it. So pigs and a cow is a nono. 
To confirm this theory I have yet to try game meat. But it is a disgusting image, because I have seen the worms in labs where they test the meat. Not everyone brings the animal over, sometimes the animal never gets to a slaughter house and is killed on a brick out back. 
Sometimes I really wish the antiparasitics for humans in czechia could be something I can buy. I know I know, eat shit ton of garlic, it'll be fine. I don't like garlic that much and it's always sticky for some reason. 
Well... yeah it's better than having worms I guess...but it better damn work. ",1,1740133295.0,u_M_er_Askani,0,1.0,False
1iunqu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1iunqu2/is_this_a_good_time_to_reach_out/,Is this a good time to reach out?,"Hi! I really need advice...

Me f25 and my avoidant ex m23 have been broken up for 5 months and we've been in nc. He broke up with me for no real reason except for that he was in graduating uni and felt lost in life. We never really had a good convo after the break up untill now.

He's been watching my stories in ig eventhough we don't follow eachother and yesterday i bumped into him. We talked for half an hour, updating eachother, joking etc. We breafley talked about us and i just said we both need to grow and that i hope he finds himself again. He said he really appreciated it coming from me etc. 

We said our goodbye's, he stood up we held eachother tight, gave me a kiss on the cheeck and another big hug. 

It felt so strange, as if you never splitt up or stopped talking. The connection still feels as if it's there, idk if i'm just being dellusional.

Now the question: Should i reach out next week? Just casually asking if he wants to catch up with a coffee? I feel like nc is over, i'm dating and i don't cry about it anymore. If he would say no, it would sting my ego a bit but i think i would be fine. Please help!! Thankyouu

1iunqty,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1iunqty/he_got_me_pregnant_cheated_and_blocked_me/,"He Got Me Pregnant, Cheated, and Blocked Me","TL;DR I got pregnant after my ex (B) and I had unprotected sex. I was using the oura ring and my cycle switched up bc I started taking vitex to make my periods less painful. He had taken me engagement ring shopping a month and a half prior, but we had issues after that bc I found someone else's hot pink glitter eyeshadow all over his sink and a blue rhinestone. I ended up miscarrying and found out he was involved with other women. He blocked me on everything without closure, refuses to return my belongings, has been spreading a smear campaign, and causing a lot of issues. I have become very ill from the stress and had to send him a cease and desist.

After he took me ring shopping, I found glitter and a rhinestone in his sink. When I asked if it belonged to his roommate‚Äôs girlfriend, the roommate said it didn‚Äôt. B then tried to stop me from leaving, begging me not to go. Later, he started picking fights, saying he couldn‚Äôt get over the fact that I almost left (even though I was just trying to get some space because he was screaming in my face). He accused me of not trusting him and became more verbally abusive over time. Eventually, he broke up with me, claiming we‚Äôd get back together once he started his business, but that he just didn‚Äôt have time for me. He also said he was dealing with mental health issues but refused to go to therapy. The night he dumped me, I went out with friends and went bar hopping. After drinking, it hit me late at night‚Äî‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm pregnant? We had unprotected sex.‚Äù So I took a test, and it was positive.

I started having a mental breakdown. I was hyperventilating. My worst fear was getting pregnant, and B knew that. My previous abusive ex (A) had sexually assaulted me. He also had a history of doing that to other women. A got me pregnant and I ended up miscarrying. It took me a long time to heal from that experience. When I got involved with B, I made it very clear from the beginning that I was terrified of getting pregnant. He spent a lot of time reassuring me that he would never leave me, even after we had unprotected sex.

That night, I tried texting B, but he was asleep and didn‚Äôt respond. My friends ended up bringing me more pregnancy tests to take. The next day, B finally replied, saying if I was pregnant, we‚Äôd figure it out and that he still liked me. But over the next week, he acted really strange. He called me about 7 times a day, almost every day, sexted me, and acted like we were still together. Then, things took a dark turn. He said some really hurtful things to me, like ""I don‚Äôt love you,"" and ""You should get an abortion."" Later, he backtracked and told me he didn‚Äôt mean any of it, claiming he just wanted to make it easier for me to move on.

Despite all of that, we got back together‚Äî even though we were already acting like we were together, and he kept insisting there was no one else. He acted weird about putting our relationship status back on Facebook. Eventually, he did update it, gave me a gift basket, and wrote me an apology letter full of the same excuses: that his biggest regret was dumping me, that he wanted to focus on his business, and that he was struggling mentally. He claimed he was excited about the baby and that we‚Äôd figure everything out.

Then things started to get even sketchier. He began treating me badly, telling me he‚Äôd rather play video games than spend time with me. At one point, while I was pregnant, he even said, ‚ÄúLife would be better if you were dead, haha.‚Äù I later found out that he had searched ""local hookups (his city)"" on Reddit, which I discovered through a local Facebook group was actually linked to prostitutes. He told me he had only been looking up porn the night we broke up, but I knew it didn‚Äôt make sense. The group he searched was local and had no photos‚Äîit was more than just porn. He was worried I‚Äôd tell his family about it. When I confronted him, he screamed in my face and told me to get out of his house. After a while, he calmed down. I was terrified because I was still pregnant, and I didn‚Äôt know where to go or what to do.

I ended up miscarrying after two months. He pretended to be supportive, but it was a struggle to get him to disconnect from his video games and come upstairs to be there for me while I was going through it. He told me everything would be okay and that we could try for kids again someday. I tried to hold on to those moments where he seemed supportive, but it was hard to ignore the feeling in my gut telling me that something wasn‚Äôt right.

Toward the end, he screamed at me and put his hand over my mouth after I found nudes of a ""friend from Tinder 5 years ago"" saved on his phone. I had told him it wasn‚Äôt appropriate, especially since they had a history of flirting and sending each other nudes, and I didn‚Äôt want him to have her on his Snapchat. After putting his hands on me, he apologized and promised he‚Äôd delete her. But just a few days before, he had threatened to delete¬†*me*¬†for her.

He asked me to visit him the weekend after he put his hands on me, and I felt terrified to go. Later, I found out through a ‚ÄúAre We Dating the Same Guy?‚Äù post that he had dumped me because he wanted to ask another woman out on a date. He had gone out with her while we were together and decided he wanted to pursue her. He lied to me and tried to keep me on the hook for sex, saying he‚Äôd want me back later. Only three hours after I told him I was pregnant and he promised we‚Äôd figure it out together, he asked her out, started talking to her about ""settling down"" and having a long-term relationship. She had no idea I was pregnant or that we were ever together. It hit me that he had been lying to me for months. Instead of being a responsible adult and supporting me, bringing me more pregnancy tests, he was in another woman's DMs.

I confronted him about everything. He tried to gaslight me at first and told me he had ""just asked her out for coffee as a friend."" When I told him I had the screenshots, he screamed at me and wouldn‚Äôt let me say anything. He called me ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù and said he never wanted me in his life again. He told me he didn‚Äôt believe I was ever really pregnant and suggested that I must‚Äôve used a two-year-old pregnancy test from when my other ex sexually assaulted me. He had never told me before that he thought I was lying about the pregnancy.

After all of that, he blocked me and ghosted me without giving me any real closure. Later, I found out from multiple women that he had been on Tinder while we were together. A lot of them said he‚Äôd been on Tinder from the time he took me ring shopping until the end of our relationship. One woman told me he claimed he was in an ‚Äúopen relationship‚Äù (which wasn‚Äôt true) and that he was a pilot (he wasn‚Äôt‚Äîhe was just visiting me). This was a week after he found out I was pregnant and after we got back together. It was the same day he gave me the apology gift basket.

I tried reaching out to him, offering to provide proof that the pregnancy was real. I also told him how awful he had treated me and asked for my things back. But he blocked me at every turn. So, I decided to contact his mom to explain what had happened (that I was pregnant, he cheated on me while I was pregnant, and he had put his hands on me) and to ask for my belongings since he lived in one of the houses she owns. She never responded, refused to look at any of the evidence, and his whole family unfriended me on everything.

His ex-girlfriend (the one he supposedly ended things on good terms with) told me he was narcissistic. She tried reaching out to his brother to help me get my things back. His brother, who barely knew me, called me ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and told her to ignore me. I also tried contacting his old roommate, who still needed to pick up his things, and another friend of his to get my stuff back. But as soon as I reached out, he would immediately call them, telling them I was ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and to ignore me. So, I sent them screenshots of everything that had happened, asked not to be dismissed, and continued to press the point that I just wanted my things back.

At one point, his friend got really rude, so I told her that if he didn‚Äôt send my things back, my only options were to send a cease and desist or do a civil standby. My ex immediately called my mom and yelled at her over the phone. My mom had previously tried to ask him to send my stuff back and even told him I was pregnant, but he had apparently blocked her. Asking for my things back was like pulling teeth. He sent my mom photos of my lingerie, saying I ‚Äúbarely had anything there‚Äù and shouldn‚Äôt expect him to send anything back. My mom offered to pay for the postage. He finally said he could leave my stuff outside for me to pick up. My mom told him I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that or driving 1.5 hours to get it. His response? ‚ÄúGood, because I would‚Äôve called the cops on her anyway.‚Äù He then said he‚Äôd told his neighbors to keep an eye out for me. He told my mom he had never cheated on me, threatened a restraining order, and even threatened a defamation suit (even though I had screenshots and evidence of everything). He said he‚Äôd only send my stuff back if I stopped talking to him, his family, and his friends, which is ironic since some of his friends have added me after the breakup and have been talking to me.

He was basically trying to control who I could talk to and stop me from telling the truth. In the end, my lawyer sent him a cease and desist to demand my things back, to tell him to stop making threats and trying to intimidate me, and to stop discrediting me. It‚Äôs been over a month, I‚Äôve tried reasoning with him, I‚Äôm tired of being smeared, and I‚Äôm emotionally exhausted.

At this point, I‚Äôve realized that him screaming in my face was completely unacceptable. It was a clear sign of him lying and was a form of abusive communication. But at the same time, I‚Äôm struggling because there was also a lot of good in him throughout much of our relationship. We bonded over so many things‚Äîour values, hobbies, religion, and life goals. I never imagined he was capable of any of this, and it‚Äôs been really hard for me to accept. I‚Äôve been struggling for the past month and a half, trying to move past everything. I‚Äôve been grieving the loss of our baby alone, and now I‚Äôm having to come to terms with the reality of who my ex really is. The stress has made me so physically ill that I‚Äôm now going to TRE and physical therapy for muscle tension. Meanwhile, he‚Äôs been chatting with other women on Reddit under posts asking for titty pics, using the same line he used with me: ‚ÄúHello fellow fish keeper!‚Äù He seemed so nice for so long, and now it‚Äôs just hard to process how he turned out.

just keep wondering: was any of the relationship real? Does he truly think I wasn‚Äôt pregnant? How could he do all of this to me? Why is he acting like I‚Äôm the threat when he‚Äôs the one who has harmed me? My mind has been looping these thoughts over and over, trying to find some peaceful solution for the past month and a half. I dreaded sending that cease and desist, but I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. Part of me doesn‚Äôt want to accept that he‚Äôs really harmed me. I keep wondering‚Äîwhat if this is all just a misunderstanding?

I‚Äôm really struggling right now and I‚Äôm desperately seeking any advice from people who have been through similar situations. I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing how you dealt with it, how you started healing, and any insights you can share to help me understand what I‚Äôm going through. I feel stuck and emotionally drained, and I just don‚Äôt know what to do next.",3,1740133257.0,domesticviolence,9,0.81,False
