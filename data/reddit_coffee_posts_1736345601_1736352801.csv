Title of the video:  
**After the Divorce, I Was Tricked Into Joining a Dating Show, and My Ex-Wife Panicked.**

Summary given in the video description:  
""Shen Yu, you must sign the divorce agreement today. I can't stand by and watch you drag our daughter down. You’re a useless good-for-nothing, not worthy of my precious daughter."" In a villa in Shanghai, a middle-aged woman, her face twisted in anger, slammed a stack of divorce papers onto the coffee table.

At that moment, a man with delicate features sat quietly on the sofa, looking gentle and refined. His almond-shaped eyes, especially those peach blossom eyes, were so captivating that each glance seemed to draw people in.

He didn’t pay attention to the middle-aged woman. Instead, he turned his gaze to the stunning woman who was sitting against the wall in silence, not saying a word. She was none other than the rising star of the entertainment industry, the ""little queen"" of the music scene, and his wife, Lin Feiwan.

He spoke softly, his voice elegant and low, warm yet carrying a hint of weariness. ""Wanwan, do you want to divorce me?""

... Shen Yu had been in a parallel world for three years, married to the popular little queen Lin Feiwan for two years, happily living as a devoted househusband. Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned, and the divorce papers shattered his dreams.

After the divorce, Shen Yu originally planned to travel abroad to change his environment and relax. However, after a meal with his best friend, he was tricked into joining a reality dating show, ""Heartfelt Lovers,"" which his friend was leading.

Meanwhile, when the little queen Lin Feiwan found out about their divorce, she immediately joined a dating show to flaunt her new relationship, causing her to lose her composure.",1,1736352251.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False

We like being productive. When others party, we pull out our laptop. When others drink Jack Daniel's, we drink coffee. When others lie on the beach, we do sports.

In my case, the result is **not** a productive life. All the above is only theory. My reality is one of increasingly difficult procrastination. I have this idealized picture of what productivity looks like and I spend most of my time distracting myself, using X and reddit. Instead of lying on the beach, I am sitting on my desk consuming social media - neither enjoying myself nor getting anything done.

Now I had an idea of what might be going on.

I spent a lot of time in my head and I am used to solve problems in my head, ruminating as an actual obsession. I don't do this as much anymore, but I do think that I have a dominant intellectual manager who doesn't want to cede control.

Here comes the thing: being productive is perfectly rational. Eating a cake is stupid, it's calories without nutritional value, five minutes afterwards any satisfaction is gone, half an hour afterwards I am hungry again. So why not eat healthy? Why ever eat pizza and drink coke?

Same for how I spend my time: doing something fun requires me *being in the moment*, which I am not. So rather do something for the future: stay fit, learn a skill, read a book, develop a product, ...

The **arguments** for being productive (be it at work or in my free time) is so strong that my other parts don't even try to argue their point. They went into rebellion instead.

Now I have a capitalist faction on the one side: work, achieve, advance! and the Antifa on the other: kick the system!

I agree with those who say that the anxiety leading up to the procedure is the worst part. 

I have five small incisions all around and a longer one right above my pubic bone. The pain has been manageable with Tylenol and twice I got IV Toradol. The gas pain has been challenging and hurts more than the incisions. Chewing gum helps with the gas, but the best thing has been getting up and walking. I was also given something for the gas, forget what it’s called. 

I pooped some blood the day of surgery. It was scary, but because I had read a lot in this group, I already knew this might happen. Doctor told me later that it’s normal. After that I’ve had a few small liquidy bowel movements, no more blood. 

I started eating some solid foods day after surgery (I don’t know of that’s day 1 or 2?). For lunch I had turkey and cheese on dry white bread, a small cup of coffee, and strawberry jello. Best meal ever, I was so hungry but tried to eat very slowly. I was a little nervous about the coffee but decided it was worth it to avoid caffeine withdrawal on top of everything else. For dinner I had some roasted chicken with mashed sweet potatoes. Strawberry jello again. I love that jello, it’s the Kozyshack brand and I’ve never seen it anywhere else but in the hospital. 
I’m drinking a lot of water and camomile tea throughout the day. 

Very thankful that I brought noise cancelling headphones since the patient across the hall is detoxing from alcohol. Why are we on the same floor you might ask. I did too and the nurse just said “we get it all here.”  
I have been listening to audiobooks and guided meditations and focused on creating a healing bubble for myself. Hospitals are the best and the worst for healing so you have to make the best of it. Be nice to the nurses and all the support staff, ask for help when you need it, respect that the staff have very specific roles and responsibilities, and strict protocols to follow. 

I was just told I’m being discharged today. I wouldn’t mind staying a third night and feeling a little nervous about going home, but will enjoy being in my own bed. 

- Try to breathe and stay calm. 
- Walk the halls as much as you can. 
- Bring noise cancelling headphones, along with your devices and chargers. 
- Check out Carol Ginandes’ guided meditation “Smooth surgery, rapid recovery” (start a few weeks before surgery)
- If your hospital has Kozyshack strawberry jello, get it! 😊

part of me took this as him indirectly calling me those things. logically i know this isn't true because he loves me so much and he has always expressed how deeply he cares about my feelings. that's why i don't want to say anything about it to him. i feel like i'll just be overreacting. but even still, i've been crying all morning after we got off the phone. i don't want to stir the pot because realistically this isn't a big issue here. but do you guys think im overreacting?

**""Either you give us grandchildren, or we're taking you off our will""**

The title sounds bad, the story is even worse. I never thought I would be writing a post about my own parents here. But here we are right?

For context: My fiancee and I have been in a relationship for the past 10 years, and just recently got engaged. While it's understandable that ten years might sound a bit too much, we started dating really early and getting married was not a priority for either of us. We actually preferred to focus on our studies and career for a while. She's a civil engineer, and I'm a medical student after getting a bachelors and a master's (I do freelancing as a developer to pay for my living expenses).

As we have been a couple for a long time, is quite common for people to ask us when we're getting married and when we're having kids. While we are getting married as soon as I finish med school. We decided not to have children a long time ago, and we're still very certain of that decision, as both of us are more career than family oriented.

However, since the engagement, our families have started to put more pressure on us to get married soon and have children, even though we told them plenty of times that's not gonna happen. My fiancee and I live together and we're completely independent from our families financially. Some time ago, during a video chat, we ended up getting into a heated argument with our families for finally snapping at their ceaseless nagging for grandchildren, and we have been strained ever since.

Now, our families asked us to meet them for a lunch ""in-family"" at my parents house. We don't live in the same city, but it's close enough that we can go there for something like this, and that's when the following situation transpired.

We arrived early enough to help out in preparing everything for the lunch, and for the next hour or so, things were pretty alright. But after we had lunch and we sat at the coffee table to chat (It's customary here), the room got visibly tense. Our parents, both hers and mine, started a speech about how much they put into us, how much they worked for us and how much family means to them.

I was already sensing some shitty thing coming but I kept listening. Suddenly, they said that during one of their talks, they came to a decision, that if my fiancee and I didn't give them grandchildren, after all they had done for us, we would be cut out of their wills. Their reasoning was this:

1. My brother, is a gay man, and as of now, have no intention of adopting or any alternative to have children, and I was the only option on continuing the family.. (He was not there, and is as mortified as I am).

2. She is the oldest sister (Her younger sister is still in high school) and thus, must set a example by having a family and continuing the family.

Now, if that's not psychotic, I have no clue what is. We quickly looked between ourselves and immediately, left their house. We haven't spoken to them since, but as far as we are aware, we're disowned by now.

I never thought I would have to go through that, just because I don't want to have children. But it just shows how much entitlement they think they have.

Cheers.

TL;DR: My family and my in-laws decided to cut my fiancee and I from their wills because we won't give them grandchildren.

*EDIT: I did not expect this to grow so much in just a few hours! Thank you everyone for the replies! Sadly, I don't think I'll be able to respond to everyone, so I'll just clear a few things here!

My fiancee and I have absolutely no interest in their inheritance. We've been fine on our own for a long time and we can take care of ourselves. Thus, we have absolutely no intention of contesting their will. We don't need that money and we don't want it. I only posted this here due to the absurdity of their actions.

We have decided to cut contact with them and uninvited them from our wedding. My brother is giving us full support on this, and as he is my best man, this already means the world to me. It's regrettable that it came to this outcome, but we are NOT going to let they run our lives.

Some people asked us why don't we want to have kids. There's a few reasons for that, especially the fact that we are both extremely focused on our careers. Having a child is a responsibility to raise someone and give them the affection, lessons and time needed. Neither of us want to go through that just to birth someone. Also, we have firm believes that the world already has people enough without us putting someone else on it. Lastly, neither of us really likes kids, as bad as that might sound, we have no intention of ever giving birth to a child.

**UPDATE: Our entitled parents who disowned us for not giving them grandchildren struck again.**

I did not expect to be back so soon, but here we are. About a month ago my fiancee and I posted here about how both of our parents decided to threaten us to be taken off their will if we did not give them grandchildren, which we won't be.

Anyhow, they struck again and my fiancee is really fuming with rage now and wants to share the situation with you all. There are some points that will need clarification and I'll try to make them along the way.

First, as we mentioned in our last post. Due to the absurdity of the situation our parents were imposing on us. We felt that we do not want them on our wedding. Thus, we rescinded their invitation as a whole. My brother is my best man and he supports us wholeheartedly. Now, we get to the point of the post.

After we left my parents home that day, we had absolutely zero contact with them. They made their decision and we made ours. We thought that was going to be it. Now, one thing that needs to be clarified. Our wedding was planned to be happening in October 17th. However, due to the pandemic outbreak these large gatherings of people were completely prohibited, on my region at least. But thankfully the Venue we had acquired is run by the most lovely administrators.

As soon as the outbreak started, they contacted us and gave us every assistance needed with rescheduling. Thus, we rescheduled our wedding to 2021 in the same month, as the situation is still uncertain, that can change but shouldn't for the time being. We aren't really bothered by it as we understand the situation is very dire and we don't mind waiting for a time which everyone will be safe (possibly).

This morning while I was studying for some exams I'll be having at school. My fiancee got a call by the venue administrator, asking why did we want to cancel our wedding. Obviously, that was very strange and confusing to us. My fiancee let them know that we had no desire to cancel or wedding and further asked what that was about.

Apparently, my fiancees parents called the venue on OUR behalf, telling them that we no longer wanted to rent the place as we would no longer be getting married. Now, let me explain why the venue was leaning on accepting this situation. In my country, our ID's carry not only our ID and Social Security (equivalent) number, but also the name of the parents, and to rent a venue you need to provide your ID for them as a bureaucracy requirement. I don't know if that's how it works everywhere, so I wanted to make it clear.

Apparently, they wanted to take advantage of that fact and tried to dupe the venue to cancel our wedding. Luckily, the administrator is quite smart and saw that on our sheet (needed for rental), there is only two names/numbers for contact if we can't be reached, one is my brother and the other is my fiancee best friend. At the time we booked the place we were already in a strained relationship with our parents so neither of us put them as contact.

Thankfully, the administrator actually paid attention to that and took the care and time to reach out to us. Otherwise we might not only lose our special date, but also all our deposit and dream venue. I'll be honest and saying that I never expected that kind of behavior from anyone in our families. But alas, it seems I was wrong.

Anyhow, now, my fiancee is letting out fumes and I'm trying to calm her down. We already sent a contact to her parents (and mine as we are sure they are in this together), for them to never try to meddle in our lives again. My brother is as angry as we are and he just told me he was heading to their house to tear them a new one.

I don't even know how to feel right now. I'm crestfallen if anything. I never expected or wanted things to be this way. But neither of us will go back on our decision of not having children. Truth be told, I already have the papers for sterilization ready.

I just hope that one day they do see that their entitlement just lost them their son and daughter. All because of grandchildren that will never exist.

Cheers.

Edit: Thank you all for the nice replies! We really appreciate it. We just spent the whole afternoon calling all our services making sure to create methods so this never happens again. It's taken care of and thank you all for the advice. I don't really know what my brother told them as he went from there to his work. I did get a text from them complaining that we released our ""rabid dog"" on them which is amusing to be honest, as my brother is a very calm person. We won't contact them again. Once more, thank you all for the kind words.

2 EDIT: We are really thankful for all the replies! We did decide on passwords with all our contracts and shouldn't have any further problems. But on that note, for those who asked, our parents didn't give us a dime to pay for our wedding. We worked ourselves and paid for every little thing. They have absolutely no right over it. I did mention this on the previous post, we don't want their money, neither do we need it. We're just sharing and venting our frustration. Anyhow, thank you all for the lovely replies and awards! Cheers!

**Relevant Comments (and OOP's response to them):**

**TheRichardAnderson**: You keep saying our parents? Is it both sets of parents or just your fiancees? Or are you also brother and sister which makes this story become even crazier lol.

OOP: Yeah, this one i should answer personally. I meant both set of parents. While her parents called the venue, mine were also involved.

OOP on him and his fiancé being cut from the will: Hey there. Just saw the notice and actually wanted to reply here.

As we mentioned, we never wanted our parents money, even if they did keep us on their will. On my part, we would probably donate it to charity. On my fiancee's part she would give it all to her sister.

We don't need it, neither does my brother. We didn't cut them because of the will. We cut them because they are trying to control our lives. That is not something we will accept. Just to clear things up, we support ourselves and we've been fine ever since leaving our parents home.

We paid for everything with our own money as we work from even before leaving their house to college. Also, education in my country is tax funded, so we don't have debts or did we need to pay for it at all.

I understand your point of view, and just wanted to clear things up. The inheritance was never the reason our relationship was strained, and it wasn't the reason for us to cut them out of our lives.

Anyway, I was getting an iced Americano, sugar-free vanilla, two packs of Stevia, heavy, whipping cream, and extra cinnamon powder. To me, this tastes pretty good and almost like a decadent drink and is super low carb. At least it’s the closest I found there. Well, I figured out that I can get pretty much the same drink except iced coffee for about a dollar cheaper since it seems like they don’t charge for extra ingredients for iced coffee but do for Americanos. It’s usually pretty good but on some days it tastes kind of watery. Is there a way to order it to make it taste stronger without upping the cost? Are there any other suggestions for making a coffee drink that is low-carb at a lower cost?

1hwn49n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hwn49n/daughters_evil_stepmother_spineless_father/,Daughter's Evil Stepmother & Spineless Father,"My ex-husband, X, and I separated in February of 2008 after 7 years of marriage. By the time our divorce was finalized, he was already dating S (12 years his junior). Our daughter, Eve (not real name), was 3yo at the time. We shared 50/50 custody. X and I had a good relationship during the divorce until S entered the picture and, in her 20yo girl wisdom, decided that I was the enemy. After that, X was no longer allowed to be friendly with me. This pattern continues to this day. Growing up, Eve was a difficult, headstrong child, to put it mildly. But not a bad kid. Over the years, I facilitated therapy for Eve and attempted to get X & S involved. S refused to attend, which meant that X was not allowed to attend. I continued getting Eve all the help I could and doing 100% of the work to make it happen. X was not allowed to help or take Eve to appointments.

X & S got married around the time Eve was 5yo. Without Eve in attendance. 

Around the time they got married, S developed a sensitivity to smells. I do recognize that this is a real thing for some people, however, S began to weaponize this to torture Eve. I, very quickly, began using unscented laundry detergent on all clothes/ bedding in our house (even mine). We used only S-approved shampoo & soap… all to no avail. S would always tell Eve that “you smell like your mom’s house.” S would force Eve to strip out of her “clothes from Mom’s house” in their garage and put them in a trash bag before going upstairs to wash her body & hair, sometimes 5 or 6 times, until S decided that she didn’t smell anymore. Yes.. she SMELLED HER HAIR after every wash and either approved her smell or sent her back to the shower to wash it again. X did absolutely nothing to stop this behavior or stand up to S. This treatment continued for years. Eve was also never allowed to bring her backpack, school work or musical instrument into their house, because it all smelled “like your mom’s.” She had to have a separate backpack for their house and, if she didn’t have a 2nd set of homework, she wasn’t allowed to bring it into their home. This made it nearly impossible for her to be a good student. 

Around the time Eve was 8, I hired the best custody lawyer in my state to try to get sole custody- to try to get Eve away from her stepmother. I was told I didn’t have a case, due to the fact that what was being done to Eve couldn't be considered abusive enough to warrant a change to our order. I continued therapy for Eve. 

Over time, X & S had 3 children. Eve absolutely adores her siblings. I met my wonderful husband when Eve was 5 and we got married in 2017, when she was 12. Our immediate family was in attendance, including hubby’s 2 children and Eve as our wedding party. My husband truly treats Eve like she’s one of his own. When COVID happened in 2020, S decided that it was too dangerous for Eve to go back & forth between our houses because of her young kids. Eve stayed exclusively with me and my husband for a couple years, with the exception of some school breaks when she was “allowed” to go to her dad’s house- only after she’d missed school to isolate & then tested negative for COVID. This situation went on significantly longer than mandated.

And, still, the torture continued. S refused to ride in a car with Eve unless she had gone through the anti-smelling ritual. So, X always had to pick her up alone & immediately go back to his house for her to WASH. When Eve started to drive, she was never once allowed to drive over to their house to spend time with her family because she would always show up smelling like her “mom’s house” or “mom’s car.” Eve was never allowed to bring gifts to her siblings if the gifts had ever been at my house. 

When COVID started winding down, Eve was a sophomore in high school. She had turned into an excellent student with her newfound stability in our home. She was working hard in school and starting to think about applying to college. At that point, going back to my ex’s would have been a major hardship for her. My husband said, “We can’t let Eve go back to that house.” After a very brief discussion with X (and assurances that he didn’t have to pay me an extra dime in child support), he agreed to let her stay with us full time. I can honestly say that COVID was the best thing that ever happened to Eve. With a combination of therapy, medication & stability, she grew up to be a brilliant, kind & confident young woman. She truly is one of the most wonderful people I know! The last time she set foot inside her father’s house was over a year ago. And she’s probably only been there twice in the past 2 years. She was old enough to decide for herself… and I think she’d finally just had enough.

X has told Eve for years that he would not be able to afford to help her pay for college. At all. Hard stop. At this time, I should tell you now about S’s school/ work history. She has a Bachelor’s degree but hasn’t worked in over 10 years. It is my understanding that X has been paying on her enormous undergraduate student loan balance the entire time they’ve been married. And, around the time Eve was applying to college, S decided that she really wanted to go back to school to get her Master’s degree. She conveniently got it all set up to start her program at the EXACT SAME TIME my daughter was starting her first year of college. But, of course, there was no money to help Eve. 

Eve is now 19yo and in her freshman year at an excellent State university a few hours away, where she received a really significant scholarship for leadership. She is studying in a STEM major. She is truly thriving. My husband and I are not wealthy, but are paying for almost all of her remaining college expenses. We purchased everything she needed for college and also moved her in. Eve is so responsible, focused & driven- we decided we had to do everything possible to make sure she could get the education she so desperately wanted. She absolutely deserves it. X didn’t contribute any of his time, money or support throughout the entire process.

This past August, before Eve left for school, she wanted to see her dad & siblings but didn’t want to see her stepmother. They met up at a coffee shop for a couple hours. X told S about it & how she was not invited. Now, S won’t allow Eve to see her dad or siblings at all. And X won’t do anything about it. So, this year, Eve had her first Christmas without seeing her dad & siblings in probably 10 years. She didn’t get to see them at all over her holiday break. She is devastated. I feel that this is the only way S can think of to hurt Eve, since she doesn’t have physical access to her anymore. She is just trying to continue Eve’s torture any way she possibly can. It is incomprehensible to me that S could cut off such a wonderful, loving person. That she could hurt a person who has literally never hurt anyone in her life. And it enrages me that X has allowed the abuse to persist over so many years. He has failed as a father & protector. 

So- please- those of you with children- decide that your child is the most important person in your life. If your girlfriend/ boyfriend acts like they don’t like your child… believe it! And understand that it almost never gets better over time. Stand up for your child. Defend your child from anyone who tries to hurt them. Hold out for a partner who will truly love and support your child, like I did. I had many opportunities to hitch my wagon to someone who wouldn’t have been a great stepparent for Eve, but I didn’t. She is too important to me. I am so grateful that Eve has me and my husband in her life: Two people that she knows she can really count on. People who support her and want the best for her. People who lift her up & make her life better. The way REAL parents are supposed to. 

I’m not sure what I’m expecting anyone to say. I just needed to get this off my chest. It’s been incredibly difficult over the years to have almost no control over my daughter’s abuse. And it’s killing me now to know how much she’s hurting and that there’s still nothing I can do to fix it for her. I will just continue to support her & love her fiercely… the way I always have.",4,1736351076.0,stories,1,1.0,False

We know each other from past 8 years and we have been dating for almost 3 years now with very much ups and downs.

So today she said I am very much insecure when it comes to she having male friends.
Now I will share my thoughts - I don't have any issues with her having male friends but if they are going to ask her out for a date or coffee that's where I loose my temper.

As a normal boyfriend I ask her to say NO to them because of course she's dating me or atleast let them know she's dating someone.
First I used to ask her to block them and all but now i ask her to deal them on her terms.
But few of her friends just keeps on asking her for a date and she refuses to tell them that she is in a relationship.

As per her she refuses because first - Her parents don't know that we are dating
Second - she's scared if they get know about us from someone else (both points sounds shit to me) Third - she can't be rude towards anyone which is true though she's way too sweet 

Now coming to me, I don't talk to any other girls apart from her. I don't feel the need to be honest
Though even i am approached by few of my friends or mutual ones but I have just blocked them because i really love my girlfriend and i don't want to spoil anything .

I know I should not keep any expectations from her but I don't like her talking to guys who ask her out constantly.
We have already talked about it but it always turns out into a fight
I know her friends who ask her out some of them already have a girlfriend yet they ask her out and i don't know why my girl is so dumb
I really don't want to fight with her again today

This makes that last cup potentially not have enough beans and the coffee is usually discarded. 

Besides being more diligent in keeping the hopper full, am I missing something here? I would have hoped that it wouldn't make that last cup. I'd rather have it discard whatever puck is made and wait for a refill so I don't also have to waste the milk that's already been poured into the cup.",1,1736350690.0,DeLonghi,3,1.0,False

First of all, I want to thank you all for the incredible support lately. The streak has been wild, and I sure hope it continues. I want to say that I did not expect my profile to explode like this, but I am happy it did (and for the good reasons).

Lately I received a lot of messages about how I make my picks. Its been difficult to answer each and every one, so I thought about making a post about how I do the selection and probably make things easier for everyone!

**1. How I bet?**

I mostly play Single bets. I have nothing against parlays, but if you expect to make consistent returns you either have to be insanely good, or insanely lucky. If I do parlay, I do not play more than 3 picks. Everyone has their own style and preference, but this is just how I do it and how I had the most success.

**2. What sports do I bet on?**

I mostly bet on basketball since it is the sport that I follow the most, and I know about it a bit more than the average person. I noticed that NBA gives me the most consistent returns, so lately it has been my main focus.

**3. How do I select my picks?**

I try to follow NBA (as much as I can since it is often hard to watch this season :D) and I pay attention to how players of interest perform against different defensive schemes and match-ups. I put a lot of attention to ANALYTICS. There are different websites for NBA analytics, but lately I've been using [https://showstone.io](https://showstone.io) About which website you should chose, I leave it up to you, but I am having a good amount of success since I started using [showstone.io](http://showstone.io) This website offers me a top picks page ( [https://showstone.io/TopPicks](https://showstone.io/TopPicks) ) that filters all the good opportunities for me to place my bets. After that, I go to the player dashboard ( [https://showstone.io/PlayerDashboard](https://showstone.io/PlayerDashboard) ) and there I begin my analysis.

**4. What to pay attention to when doing the analysis?**

I am sure that everyone does this in a different way, but my approach is - FIRST I look at the injury table. There I can see which players are missing or DTD and in the table i can see how them not playing impacts my selected player's minutes per game, and prop performance. The table quantifies the impact (for example +5 points) and tells you based on how many games that impact is calculated (EXAMPLE: With Doncic out, based on 10 games this season, Kyrie scores +5 points on average - numbers are random just for the sake of explaining it).

Then I look at the performance vs the Line and check how the player i selected performed vs the line. If I like what i see so far, I observe the Prop trends and check whether his trend is increasing or decreasing, how many minutes per game he is playing (last 15 vs last 5), and how much these L5 and L15 averages on the selected prop differ from the bookie line.

After that, I observe how the player performed vs the opponent. Showstone offers L5 against the opponent bar and I do think that this info is valuable, ESPECIALLY if they had a recent game. After that, I observe how the opposing team performs against that prop against the selected player's position (If i selected a guard, how many pts/reb/ast the opposing team allows vs guards). Showstone also provides this info (which is great) and ranks the opposing team on that metric (best/worst).

If the math adds up (so to speak), and my gut feeling agrees with it, I select the player and place my bet.

**5. How much should you bet on my Picks?**

I think this is a very individual thing and everyone needs to make their own conscious decision about it. I do not feel comfortable telling people how and what they should do with their money. We are all adults, and betting responsibly should be everyone's goal. I suggest that you make a betting budget (monthly/weekly) and accept that sometimes you will make and sometimes you will lose some money. This way, it is much easier to track your wins and loses, and (with some discipline) avoid heavy losses (I've been there before).

If you have any questions, I am always happy to answer (if time allows me to) and I hope that this post cleared up some things and can help you improve your performance. Also, I do not claim to be a betting expert, I do not claim that I will have 100% accuracy and make you a millionaire if you tail my bets. I like sports, I like analytics, and I like sports betting. I see it as an opportunity to cash in on my basketball knowledge and I basically look for opportunities where I disagree with the bookies' lines the most. Lately, I've been doing pretty good and I am happy and excited to see the amount of support I am getting. Only thing I can promise is that I will continue to post with great attention to detail and do my best to keep the streak going. Also, I will not post anything that I would not be comfortable putting my own money on. 

Since my profile exploded in the last few days, I decided to open a buy me a coffee account to (possibly :D) increase my betting budget a bit. I am not forcing anyone to support but If you like what I do, feel free to show some love.

I've been using my flair for the last couple weeks and had encountered some issues, most prominently not being able to keep high pressure for any reasonable amount of time. The suggestions given to me were always to ""grind finer"" but my shots were already running very slow.

I searched the web for infos and tried to thinker around with small stuff without any improvement and was getting really frustrated.

Today I did 3 ""radical"" things that lead me down a new path (still need to dial in properly) and even if I cannot pinpoint for sure what was the main solution , I'd like to share my experience with the web so that maybe one day somebody might get insight from this

1) I cleaned my grinder. The grinder is new, not even hand a kilo ran through it. I decided to check once again the burr lock position (can't remember why) and noticed it shifted massively. I panicked a bit and disassembled the burr chamber, it's not a type of grinder where you can mess much with the burss but I've found extremely fine coffee powder stuck around, this was most likely a retainer of my very first grind on this unit where I misinterpreted the maker's guideline and ground something fit for Turkish or even finer. I don't think this was doing much but once cleaned the burr lock point reversed to what was initially set and changing grind size is a lot smoother 

2) I decided to drop temporarely the ""hook lock"" system of the flair, and actually go back to the original filling method of removing the plunger and filling the chamber. This was after I tried many different style of chamber filling with the plunger locked in position. Doing this allowed me to really see insider understand the shape of the chamber and see what was going on in the next pint which is

3) my water was boiling. This time around probably less than other times as I've used hotter water in the past and let the preheat run for quite some time, but it was properly boiling. I never questioned this because in many videos online they suggest of going as high as possible with pre heating and water temp, never hoped back as the resulting water temp would only reach around 92 - 93 C.

Now I don't know if it's my temp controlled kettle that messed it up (I've tested it in the past and was pretty consistent, but now I'm hearing way less water at a time so it might not be as accurate) or the flair itself that superheat the water, but by lowering the temp and make sure that it's not boiling the whole thing turned around.

Now grinding at setting that previously resulted in very slow, almost chocked shots (and still hating trouble maintaining pressure) when I was supposed to be in proper espresso range according to other owners of the grinder, now my shots run visibly fast. I still have trouble maintaining pressure but now I can indeed grind finer end expect thing to work properly.

After that I can retrace my step and find out the best workflow and temp settings to really have my espresso shine! 

I hope somebody can benefit from this",0,1736350224.0,FlairEspresso,1,0.5,False

1hwmqb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hwmqb1/hi_all_i_f28_am_having_a_hard_time_with_my/,"Hi all, I (F28) am having a hard time with my boyfriend (M34) of 3 years. Could breaking up be the right choice? ","Throw away account.

Hi all, I'm not good at explaining things haha, sorry.  
My bf is a good guy, maybe a bit cold and I'm clearly the golden retriever like lover in the relationship.

Sometimes I envy other couples, I know it's not a green flag to post how happy you are with your partner all the time in socials. I'm not talking about that., but about couples who are genuinely affectionate with each other and it shows. I also want something like that sometimes...

Usually I am the one who asks for more affection, I realize that he makes the effort to do so and I appreciate it. But I still feel like I want something different, that I need more, and he can't give me that. Still, I was willing to stay.  
  
But lately I feel like he doesn't value what I do for him either.

For example, I'm willing to tolerate his friendship with his ex (F33), it's not like they see each other very often anyway. Of course it bothers me, yes. It was quite a recurrent topic in the relationship, and although I am better now, it is still somewhat uncomfortable for me.

Yesterday we argued about something related to that, I think he was right in some stuff, but he said some things that I feel were unfair to me.

What really hurt me the most when we argued is that he doesn't appreciate that I'm trying, that I'm putting myself in an uncomfortable and painful situation for me. That I pamper him, that I give him a lot of love. Or that's what I feel at least, since he is not very demonstrative.

Sorry if this is getting long but I feel that explaining what happened is important, here it goes...

A while ago his ex came back from vacations and brought him a gift, she always brings him gifts after every vacation.  
Well, she wanted to meet up with him to catch up and give them to him. I told him that I didn't feel comfortable with the two of them seeing each other alone, thinking that it was in her house, he told me yesterday when we talked, that it was for a coffee somewhere else. But still, I suggested that time instead for her to have coffe at his house and me being there too, since I'm always there anyways. And so I could meet her, I've never seen her and I think that getting to know her might actually be good for me.

He agreed to inviting her, but she said no because it made her uncomfortable, it was too sudden. So they didn't see each other and she didn't come either because she was leaving to the beach the next day. This was like two weeks ago.

So yesterday the ex was going to meet my boyfriend's brother on a bar because they are somewhat friends, and she said we could go too so I could get to know her. And here is where my bf is right for getting mad at me, it was very sudden for me too (he told me 4 hours before that), but I said yes.

As the time approached I got cold feet so I decided not to go. The brother and his girlfriend told me that it was okay if I'm not ready yet, so that calmed me down. But my boyfriend got angry because I was the one who asked to meet her first and I made him not go see her the first time. He said that I was being childish and toxic.

Listen, I know I am an insecure person, maybe someone more relaxed is a better fit for him. I do keep in mind that being on good terms with an ex-partner is not a bad thing, but sometimes it's too dificult for me, it makes me uncomfortable. Especially when she was his first girlfriend and they were together for 11 years, heck, they were childood sweethearts...

Anyways, I started thinking that maybe we are not good for eachother. I might actually be too childish for him, he is my first everything actually, and he has gone through a lot with her. I know it's not okay to make him cut all contact with her, I won't do that. But sometimes I wish he'd understand my point of view too.

I know I do have my bullshit, sometimes I don't value what he does or I don't take it to account. Or still being uncomfortable even though he proves me that he doesn't feel anything romantic for her anymore, that he is okay.

I do also overthink a lot, I always say that I don't think I could be with someone like myself.

Still, this might be too much for me, but it's why I'm too conflicted about breaking up. Maybe if I keep trying I can finally be okay or at least to have it not bother me too much?

But in short, what really hurts me the most is that I feel he doesn't value the things I do, putting myself through this situation and trying to be okay with it. And at the same time he can be cold sometimes, I don't mind because he is still somewhat affectionate, but sometimes I need a bit more... He said that after that relationship, he has a hard time being romantic. And it kills me sometimes.

But also... am I seeing the grass greener on the other side when I think that I could be better with someone else?

I know I'm hard to be with, and he doesn't mind, so that's a lot too.

Anyways, sorry, I have a hard time being brief when telling stuff. Thank you for reading and sorry if my english is weird.",1,1736350060.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I still remember the first time we met. She was sitting at the coffee shop, a book in her hands, her eyes lost in the pages. There was something about her—a quiet warmth that drew me in, a beauty not just in her face, but in the way she spoke, in the way she listened. It felt like fate when we started talking.

We fell in love quickly. We had shared dreams, the same kind of laughter, and the same understanding of silence. She was my best friend, my confidante, the person I thought I would grow old with. She promised me that she would never leave, that we would build something special together.

But then, slowly, I started to notice things—small things at first. Her phone constantly face down, sudden ""late meetings"" at work, texts she deleted before I could see them. She said I was imagining things, that I was paranoid, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

One evening, when she said she was going to a friend's house, I followed my instincts. I drove to the address she had given me, only to find her car parked outside an unfamiliar apartment building. My heart raced as I walked toward the door, then froze when I heard laughter. It was her laughter, but it wasn’t just hers. There was another man’s voice.

I stood there for what felt like an eternity, too hurt to move, too confused to understand. Finally, I left. I didn’t want to confront her, not yet. I needed to breathe, to think, but the ache in my chest was unbearable.

The next day, when she came home, I asked her about it, my voice trembling. She denied everything, but I could see it in her eyes—the guilt, the regret, and something else I couldn’t name. She confessed then, barely above a whisper. 

She had cheated on me. Not just once, but over the past few months. She said it was a mistake, that she was sorry, but the words felt hollow. They didn't erase the images in my mind, the feeling of betrayal that had seeped into every corner of my heart.

I wanted to forgive her. I really did. I wanted to believe that it could all go back to normal, that we could rebuild, but the trust was shattered. And so was I.

She left a few days later, saying it was for the best, that she needed to find herself, or whatever excuse she had in her mind. I let her go, though I didn’t want to. And as I sat there, alone in the quiet of the empty apartment, I realized that I wasn’t just losing her—I was losing the version of myself that had loved her so deeply, so blindly. 

The memories of us together—our laughter, our plans—now felt like a cruel joke. She was gone, and I was left holding the pieces of a love that was never as real as I had believed.",1,1736349968.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1hwmnyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hwmnyq/my_friend_32f_ignored_my_other_firend_25m_when_he/,My friend (32F) ignored my other firend (25M) when he asked her out. ,"Hello, i'd like some advice navigating this situation between myself and two of my friends.

I (m26) attended a birthday party a few weeks back, and while I was there, one of my friends 'Melissa' (32F) texted me asking if I was doing anything that evening. I invited her to be my plus one at the birthday party, after getting approval from the host 'Tommy' (M25).

Party went on perfectly, everyone got on like a house on fire, Melissa even ended up taking some beers home with the offer to venmo Tommy later as her and I where heading to a other houseparty afterwards. 

Next day, Tommy texts me Mel left her backpack at his, I pass on the info, they organise a pick up time few days after. She picks up her bag, pays Tommy for his beers, all is right in the world. That day, Tommy texted me and asks if she's seeing anyone. I answer no, because she's not. But also say last time her and I spoke, she had no interest in dating right now as she has a hectic work life. 

Tommy tells me he's gonna ask her out, I say good luck, leave it at that. He texts her. She reads the message preview, she asks me go grab a coffee to talk about it. When we catch up, she told me he sent two text messages, she opened the first one, but not the second one where he actually asked her out on a coffee date. I explained Tommy had expressed his interest to me and asked me for a vibe check, and I said it was probably not gonna happen because of her work schedule. 

Melissa explained she was frustrated at being asked out because she felt like she now had to express emotional labour to turn down someone she personally didn't take a romantic interest in. I told her I intentionally gave her an easy excuse out, we discussed how she should respond, and finished our coffee's

A few days later, Tommy texts me expressing his disappointment at the fact Melissa left him on read, and didn't even reply at all. Tommy explained that it's not the fact there wouldn't be a date that was disappointing, rather the lack of respect in being left on read. 

Sorry for the drawn out story, I'm just trying to include as much context as I can to avoid info getting lost in clarafying information in the comments. 

Here's my conflict, i'm actually finding myself really frustrated with Melissa for her behaviour. Of course she doesn't owe anyone a date, and I never honestly thought she'd accept the offer, but blantly ignoring someone's earnestly trying to connect with you just seems unessessarily disrespectful. Tommy is a friend of mine who I value, and this is how she is going to treat my friends. It doesn't really make me want to include her in other social situations that are going to involve anyone I'm close too. 

On the flip side, it's not by buisness. I intentionally stayed out of it by not telling Tommy outright if he should or shouldn't shoot his shot, and didn't give Melissa a heads up it was coming because I didn't want to medal, and now Im unsure if me discussing her behaviour is meadling further. Like Tommy is fine, he's a big boy he took it on the chin and moved on. I guess in just internally conflicted that, Melissa, someone who I value dearly, would just treat someone else I value with such disregard. 

I know I'm in no way responsible for what happened, but I do feel somewhat responsible for introducing the two people, and if I had known Melissa would respond how she did, I wouldn't have invited her and introduced her to my friends.

But also, it's an ignored text message, is it just not that deep and I need to not worry about it? But I've been sitting on this for a few days and it's not feeling right with me. 

So what do we think? Give me some insight before I run myself in circles, thanks x 

TLDR: Melissa ignored Tommy when he asked her out. I feel this behaviour is disrespectful and it's made me unsure what (if anythung at all) I should say to Mel. ",1,1736349885.0,relationship_advice,17,0.56,False

A few days ago I stumbled up on some articles wich we’re about the way consuming coffee (more specially coffeine) is different for people with adhd, now I’m curious and I wanted to ask what are your experiences with coffee? Do you get sleepy (like the articles said it would be)? Or do you feel not any change? Or something entirely different?

I’m sorry for any grammar mistakes I made English isn’t my first language

1hwmfqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/converts/comments/1hwmfqe/growing_faith/,Growing Faith?,"I have struggled with faith for most of my life. 

TLDR: I grew up in a highly religious household with an elder of one of the largest Christian organizations. While they did not fall into the elites of the church we were acquainted with them and their processes, traveling all over the US to visit churches and promote a nonprofit that belonged to the church. I learned of the many horrors of what could happen when religious organizations run wild. From promoting politicians and political messages, to plans to “show those the light” via humiliation and degradation. 

Needless to say that I have a very complicated perspective on faith vs congregations. 

I struggle with the concept of participating in any religious organizations, unless it is necessary. Because I live in a very conservative state within the US, most programs for outreach or helping others have to do with religious ideologies. Though it has helped with desensitization it has forced me in a spot where I feel very isolated. 

I began the journey to Islam almost a decade ago, when I first heard stories of what was really happening to those who practiced in my community. I was fired from a job that I enjoyed because I stood up for a Hijabi woman that worked with me at a coffee shop. I told my manager that it was not okay to play Christian music in the establishment because it was stressing my coworker out. She didn’t have a lot of money and the job was her only source of income, and with the exclusionary practices of the culture she would not have been able to find another one. So in that one on one meeting I let the manager know that it was for me and not her, and thus fired for a faith I did not even practice at the time. 

This got me to dig a bit deeper into what was happening and I learned more about the faith, but with the relationship and community I was in I was not able to go further. I am still in a place where practicing outright would not be encouraged, and I am not sure what else I can do. I am working so hard to get back on my feet so I can have the independence to explore things in my own time, but I want to know what I can do to stay involved. 

I started learning Arabic (something I wanted to do for a long time because I love poetry and is overall unrelated) and I am trying to learn more about the basics of the faith. If I am being honest the reason why I am so invested and love it so much is because of the research I did on Sufism and the concepts of oneness. It was the only thing that got me through the tough patches I was in for almost a decade now. 

The reality is I don’t know a lot of the basics, but as I learn about them I have found that I practice a lot of them already. For the past decade I have had what I call rug time, where I spend time meditating and practicing hobbies on the my special rug a couple of times a day. I follow the food restrictions because it was how I was raised as well, and I practice modesty in a similar way when out in public. When I traveled people thought I was a Muslim because of the rug and I didn’t really get that at first because I was just unaware. 

It just feels right, but I don’t know where to go from here, I don’t even know if I would qualify as a participant because I am so new to everything and I wont be able to practice until I get out of the place I am currently living. The last time I tried it ended very poorly and I don’t know what I could do.

I love strawberry anything, so I was hoping for great things with the strawberry bdc. Sadly, its my first bdc that has ever separated AND it smells too artificial to me.

Biscotti I couldnt even move past the smell.

Cookie butter, I loved the scent but hated the tint; swiss miss was the opposite, loved the tint but the scent was sickeningly too sweet. Cherry is neutral to me! Solid balm, good color.

Im still hurt someone stole my mango bdc last year because I loveddddd that balm. Mango is literally the best for me and takes me back to getting mangos from a streetcar in NYC during the summertime.

Coconut makes me think of a good tropical vacation. Its just such a mild inoffensive scent. Its so just damn pleasant, ive had it for years and hasn't separated.

I was prepared to hate espresso with how wildly polarizing the reviews were for the set but instantly loved the tint and smell. It's what I wanted from the swiss miss bdc but better. Plus I love a good cup of coffee. Its been my winter bestie since purchasing it.

Mango, coconut and espresso are balms I can re-apply all day long without being sick of scent nor be bothered by the texture like birthday bdc (that glitter man!!)

I just bought lavender from the recent sale. I am not a mint or rose girly and gave mine away. Ive seen people say wild fig taste like soap though its been so coveted, Im too afraid to try it. Rip to never getting Berry, I would have bought it if I knew it was being discontinued.

Ill buy black cherry when Ive panned more of my balms. I haven't tried half of the balms and thats okay with me because I want to spend money on plane tickets not more balms. ",4,1736349225.0,glossier,1,1.0,False

Should I be concerned? ,"Hello everyone, first of all sorry for any spelling mistakes as English is not my native language... I need some advice about the only friend that I have at the moment...   
  
I (21M) recently started working and quickly bonded with a great co-worker (22M) who’s been showing me the ropes. We clicked right away - same hobbies, music tastes, ideas, you name it - and soon began hanging out outside of work. At first, it was every weekend. We’d grab coffee, play cards or games, just the two of us. 

Over time, he started talking about his friend group and how much they’d enjoy doing the same activites we were doing together. Since I struggle with meeting new people alone due to past issues I don't want to bring up (but he knows very well about, as many times I opened up about it), I suggested to invite his friends to join us sometime. I thought it could be a safe way for me to open up and make new connections with him there as support and safety. However, he repeatedly said he doesn’t like mixing friend groups, nor bringing in new people as it becomes difficult to handle. Fair enough - I do not agree (would kill to have so many good friends) but respect his opinion, so I stopped bringing it up.

Our weekends together became less frequent since he understandably wants to spend time with his other friends, which is not what bothers me really. What it does is that recently, he met someone new and invited them to join his group right away. They’re now doing movie nights, game nights, and spending weekends together. I’m genuinely happy for him, but I can’t help feeling like I’ve done something wrong to deserve being left out.

That said, he still reaches out to me and invites me to hang out - always alone - from time to time, so I don’t think he dislikes me, quite the opposite. But every time we meet, he shares stories about his group’s fun times, and it makes me feel isolated and a bit unwanted and undeserving. 

I’m wondering - should I be concerned about the authenticity of our friendship, or is this just my anxiety and bad past experiences clouding my judgment?",1,1736349050.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1hwm995,https://www.reddit.com/r/Patagonia/comments/1hwm995/o_trek_report_dec_27jan_34/,O trek report - Dec 27-Jan 3/4,"Hi all,

Appreciate all the insights from others so wanted to share my trip report for the O-Trek Dec 27-Jan 3. 

sorry so long but I have hike notes, clothing and general comments/lessons

Highlights:
- making friends!!! Candidly this is the best part. 
- quiet hiking. Some days we only saw 1-2 other groups who passed us. Not the same on the W side. 
- knowing you finished it
- talking to porters and regulars in the park..some awesome stories and most are surprised you want to talk to them. One group smoked us out which was great after the pass. 

A comment about the social aspect: as you'll see, we split from our O group from Grey to Paine Grande. In retrospect this was a bummer but we planned this 6 months ago. We made friends and felt we were starting over with social bonds. We didn't connect with many others until maybe Frances (other folks on the O). I think I would advise just starting late at Grey after the pass to rest and continuing on with your group, if socializing is important to you. 

Onto the show:

Day 1: Arrival and Seron Hike  
- 7:00 AM: Bus to TdP. No WiFi after 30-45 minutes; pay attention to instructions. Bus station at PN can be hectic. 
- 8:40 AM: Arrive at TdP checkpoint, have to get off bus sur to check tdp tickets, and head to shuttle (3-minute walk).  Some comments about bus sur: Sit at the front to get off and your ticket checked.  Don't be an asshole and run to front *while* the park ranger is giving instructions. (Yes someone did this)
- 9:20 AM: welcome center has food and bathrooms Start Seron hike (~9 miles). Arrived around 1–2 PM.  

Camp Seron:  
  - Tent: Comfortable, padded base. Elevated and larger than vertice tents. Premium were against the wooded areas (helped keep cool)
  - Food: Veggie quesadilla $12 (good), beer $7.  
  - Facilities: 2 showers/toilets per gender, potable but milky water. Kitchen area is 3 large bench tables. 
  - Notes: Reservation system is obviously confusing. It's worth checking your reservation a couple months in advance. Someone next to us mistakenly order the wrong setup - no sleeping bag and she didn't bring one. The tents were cold at night.  
- Rest: Nap (4–7 PM), sleep (9 PM–5 AM).  

Day 2: Seron to Dickson  
- 5:30 AM: Wake up; hiking by 7:30 AM.  
- Hike: (~9 km to checkpoint, 9 km to Dickson)  
  - First half: some elevation, dry.  Great views throughout 
  - Second half: hot, minimal shade, mostly flat but a steep, slippery descent at the end.  

Camp Dickson:  
  - Tent: Warm but small. Premium tents in sunny spots; shaded areas for personal tents.  
  - Food: Burger + beer $20 (good).  
  - Facilities: 2 showers/toilets. Lake water questionable due to horse activity.  
  - Vibe: Social but noisy (generator runs until 10 PM). 

Quick comment about the water: horses roam free here and poop everywhere. they poop right next to the water source. This was the only place we filtered our water. 

Another note on the horses roaming free. I had the pleasure of waking up to them eating the grass under my rain fly and then them ripping the rain fly right off the zipper. Funny story especially because multiple people saw it from different vantages. Yelling ""GET"" didn't seem to work. 

Day 3: Dickson to Los Perros  
- 6:30 AM: Wake up; hiking by 8:20 AM.  
- Hike: (~10.5 km, ~9 miles)  the GPS is off for this one. 
  - Mostly uphill with forest flats. Beautiful water features throughout. Final 2 km: Rock scree in the sun.   Payoff is a small glacier lake. 

Camp Los Perros:  
  - Cozy, woodsy, barebones.  Forces you to be around others and the bonding really started. 
  - Facilities: Cold faucet shower, 2 toilets, 2 sinks.  
  - Food: Ramen, candy, soda available.  
  - flies suck here

Day 4: Los Perros to Grey (The Pass)  
- 4:00 AM: Wake up; hiking by 5:20 AM.  
- Hike: (~10 hours, others did it far less)
  - Pass: Foggy, trail marker to marker navigation, minor snow patches. Th se can be avoided. Spikes not needed. 
  - Downhill: rain all the way down. Steep, wet, forest cover helped with rain but it was a tough day. Slow pace due to an injured buddy (~1 hr/mile). Many others had minimal issues and powered thru. Great views of glacier throughout. 3 suspension bridges. And God awful uphill at times. 
  - Rain gear failure: due to the rain, my North face jacket wetted out and my buddy's bag cover wetted out. Much of our stuff in bag was wet. His moreso than mine  

Camp Grey:  
  - First hot shower in days. Buddy’s tent was drenched because the back fly was open
  - Vibe: Bonded with others over shared misery Of the rainy pass and decent. Ultimately it was one of the best nights. 

Day 5: Extra Day at Grey  
- Rest day to recover after the pass.  
- Kayaking: Great NYE weather; dried gear alongside others.  
- Socializing: everyone in the group moved on to Paine grande. Mixed feelings—new groups formed, but dynamic shifted. Thankfully with my wife and close friend. 

Day 6: Grey to Paine Grande  
- Hike: Easy but tiring; rushed to avoid worsening rain.  
- Camp Paine Grande:  
  - Blessing to find out we have two rooms.  
  - Facilities: WiFi, pizza, beer, and a fire. Stayed indoors due to rain and wind. 

Day 7: Paine Grande to Italiano to Frances  
- 8:30 AM: Start hike to Italiano (~6.2 miles, 2.5 hours).  
- Mirador Británico:  
  - Left bags at Italiano. Hiked in sandals; ascent ~2:15 hours, descent ~2:20 hours.  
  - Beautiful sunny day, stunning views at the top.  
- Camp Frances:  
  - Tents uphill, bathrooms a hike away. First camp with shower wait times.  
  - Small cooking area, tight but social. Connected with new ppl.  

Day 8: Frances to Cuernos to Central  
- Frances to Cuernos: Stopped for a beer, filled water, and enjoyed the spot. The bar was nice.  
- Cuernos to Central: Long hike, hot due to hiking into the sun. Wore hats and used cold water from crossings to stay cool.  
- Split from buddy heading to Chilenos. Took an additional hour to reach Central Welcome Center.  
- Missed the 2:00 PM shuttle and waited for the 7:00 PM shuttle, then Bus Sur around 7:40 PM (departed early).  


Some lessons/thoughts
- BE FRIENDLY, SOCIAL AND ENGAGING EARLY!
- print copies of everything for the O. 
- wifi is expensive, not worth it, unless you need your tickets like me 😂
- buying food there ($12 quesadilla or $20 burger+beer) isn't that expensive compared to a $10 dehydrated meal and carrying it. Something to consider. Protein is a consideration here. 
- largely felt full board (we only did it at grey) was not worth it. Rather buy a la carte. 
- bring a pair of shorts. 
- I loved my barefoot sandals (xeros)
- waterproof liner or garbage bag 
- one medium size jet boil cannister was enough for 3 people (oatmeal, dehydrated meals and coffee)
- TAKE YOUR TIME on the back side hikes. Don't rush. No fires but stop to enjoy a snack or something. 
- **** Start a Whatsapp group with everyone..just keep adding. We have one and it's great to keep up with people after *****

Clothing
- underwear (5 pair): hated airism with seam boxers for Uniqlo. Seamless were great. MeUndies did well
- pants (2 pair) beyond ventum pants were amazing. Wore them every day. 
- rain gear:  $20 rain pants from Amazon were great, $100 North face sucked
- keep a dry/clean fleece or something warm 
- Shirts: 2 wool tees (meh), 2 kuhl hiking (loved), 1 REI sun hoodie (could be hot but I always appreciate having it). Keep a clean tee for the night. 
- others: had a beyond puffer and Columbia fleece. Probably overkill and bulky but was glad I had both. Looking at improving this for next 

Lastly, we enjoyed two restaurants in PN, asador patagonico and la terreza (sp?)

Asador patagonico had great food and booze. Same with terreza but they have an outdoor seating area that our O group took over the night we all returned to PN. We closed the restaurant and the owner gave us all pisco sours before we left. Was a great ending to the trip. Some went to Last Hope distillery to continue drinking and enjoyed it. 

I'm so grateful we did this hike and met the people we did.  I hope this report is helpful to you.

It lets you track arbitrary metrics on yourself then visualize & correlate them, which is EXACTLY what this sub is about. I’m honestly shocked. I didn’t realize there was that many more people interested in quantifying everything.

I built Cora for myself, but I would love to build for you guys as well.

1hwm5iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hwm5iz/anyone_else_here_married_and_living_with_inlaws/,Anyone else here married and living with in-laws?,"TL/DR: living with in-laws in a house, shared common spaces due to ongoing self (husband) gut renovation project (2+ years) of seperate basement apt. MIL has health issues we are trying to help with, helping them with mortgage and all things practically needed i.e. repairs and car rides, dog care, yard, recycling, etc., Husband enmeshed in codependent dynamic with elderly parents, has ADHD (rx) and it has taken a toll on our marriage. Please share any tips or tricks if you've been in a similar situation. Don't tell me to leave or make a big scene and give him an ultimatum. My mental health can't handle that, TIA. 🙏

I (F/36) have been married 3+ years (but in a roller-coaster relationship) with my husband (38) since I was 23. We've been friends since high school, so we go way back. He has ADHD, dx and rx for the last 4 years. Explains a lot of the fucked up shit he did prior to the dx which we actively worked to repair and we got married. That's not what I want to focus on now, just a little bit of context that we also have a good bit of baggage.

I want to know how many people have been married and lived or currently living with their in-laws and how they coped with those challenges. Let's say those in-laws are not super toxic, mine are not but the dynamic is very co-dependent and my husband due to his and their shared past trauma, is basically enmeshed with them and their needs.

They are elderly. FIL a bit younger and is healthy and working FT. MIL has a host of health problems (heart failure, DMT2, etc) and was the accelerating reason why we moved into their new house, she is still quite able bodied and manages a lot of it on her own. DH helped them buy the house 4+ years ago. There is a seperate basement apartment which DH wanted to completely gut renovate and it has been 2 years now with the space still not ready. He is clearly overwhelmed and not setting boundaries with parents, always tired, works FT and is the main fixer of all things house related, and being available to his parents whenever they need it. If he isn't at work, he is available to them, and usually to me lastly, or that is what it feels like. He tries very hard to make everything work and needs a lot of my support to be a more understanding wife with much less complaining and negativity. I struggle with depression and anxiety, PMDD and had a misscarriage last summer. Transition to living with his family has been hard for me. I have been in therapy for many years and off meds now, trying very hard to actively learn how to manage myself better, but I need a good bit of emotional support and availability which DH has a hard time delivering consistently. Lacking a big support system outside of this, which I'm aware of and working on building for myself. This is just for context, not a primary discussion point, but if you have been there, please share if you want. 

I have talked to him ad nauseam about setting more boundaries with his family, and he now shows a lot of resentment and contempt toward me bringing this up. (I.e. rolling eyes, making ""ugh"" sounds, saying ""yeah, yeah, I know"" and sometimes irritatingly asking me to ""stop talking about that specific issue."") One example is that he has to wake up 1 extra hour early every day and most weekends to take his dad to the train station for his dad to get to work. It's a 10-15 min ride one way and he usually gets out of bed and goes in PJs and comes back to have coffee and have blast and take care of his needs and get ready for work. He is always tired, we try to go to sleep extra early but that isn't consistent enough. There is a bus the dad can take but when pandemic happened, he got all scared of vagrants in the early wee dark mornings at 5 am, and BIL started giving him rides to work so now he just expects it, there's no going back. BIL moved out, DH took over the rides when we moved in. FIL was taking driving lessons but there is no extra car and it doesn't make sense since it would be an added cost and he'd be driving it to public transportation. That's one example of something that could change for him to be able to prioritize his well being and energy but my husband cannot and will not tell them no, basically waiting for FIL to retire in 2, 3, 4 years. He strongly believes he owes his parents, he isn't close with his dad and dislikes him a lot but again, familial trauma and codependency and no other siblings are readily available to help deal with all these things. The entirety of our relationship he has told me he wants us to move in with them, so I knew this and didn't want to do it in a shared space, but well here I am. It's also cultural so that's that. My husband knows how unhealthy this is, we lived independently for 9+ years, but we made the decision to try this because it seemed like a good and necessary choice at the time.

I have been wanting to be able to settle down with him, have a baby and have the aid of his mom with that but I keep having misscarriages and with the space situation and codependency I am severely disillusioned. Our marriage is almost on the rocks at this point. Have been seeking couples counseling but because he always makes excuses for time, energy, or saying a specific therapist isn't good enough, I gave up on trying to make this happen. Due to a blow up we just had, we need to do this as we can't communicate respectfully anymore and can't concede to each other's perspectives almost at all. We both want to be heard and understood but we both won't actually let the other person feel that, if that makes sense. I am aware we need couples counseling and that will likely start that soon. He is supposedly getting a new therapist after he took a break from old one that he didn't like but also didn't make time for properly since he started working FT. I have little confidence he will actually prioritize this, but that's his perogative, I am tired of telling him what to prioritize because he resents me for it and I resent him for not doing it. Can we survive this? 

Please share some hopeful stories because I know this is very bad and I'm not doing well emotionally about it all so the idea of my marriage ending or up-ending my life right now will do more harm than good. Thank you for reading this depressing novel. 

P.S. - My husband has many good qualities and although at this moment in time, I am really struggling with seeing them, he is basically a self-sufficient, need no help, tough it out, fun loving, jokester, socially awkward but we'll liked type guy who cares for people and wants to do a lot in any sphere of his life. He isn't abusive but he does have some anger and impulse issues and says hurtful things for which he apologizes, aknowledges and makes efforts to change them. But cannot sit with shame/guilt/rejection for long due to his past trauma and ADHD. That's not to say that I myself don't say hurtful things or have emotional reactions that are not helpful, also working on it. It is a rough dynamic and I'm not sure if our marriage can handle the amount of stress we have been under since moving here. We also lived rent-free for a year+ with in-laws and were both unemployed. I don't have a stable job and I'm on unemployment for now. ",1,1736348508.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

Recently I started getting frequent tension headaches - about two per week. And neither ibuprofen nor paracetamol helped. The only thing to do was to go to sleep and wake up feeling well.

Now, I also started a pretty stressful job. Only mentally stressful, nothing physical. 
So far it's only part time (I work weekends), and I'm typically at my job for 11 hours. I come at 7am and leave at 6pm (some breaks in between for food and rest). I typically have 3 cups of coffee throughout the day.

I went to see a doctor for my headaches and she said it's likely due to my work and the coffee. That I need a better routine and less coffee - that's fine, will do.
She also took my blood pressure and it was 130. She said that it's a bit high for my age and prescribed vasodilators.

Now, I'm not a doctor, but I'm not sure about taking this medicine without applying lifestyle changes first. Is it really necessary? Or am I overthinking it and vasodilators aren't that big a deal?",1,1736348199.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

On Monday I went for a blood test, but I've just had a call from my GP medical receptionist to say I need to repeat the blood tests and that she has a note that I need to be better hydrated. I asked if there was anything concerning, and she said she didn't know and that she could only book the next blood test and pass on this message to me. 

My blood test was at 11am. I am often well hydrated, and I drink around a litre of water between midnight and 9am. I keep a 1ltr bottle next to my bed and have a glug whenever I get up to use the loo, and then finish the rest when I wake in the morning. I also have two instant black coffees before midday.      
However, as this is second nature to me I can't be completely sure I did drink enough that morning. I definitely didn't feel dehydrated though, as I am quite sensitive to that and always carry a water bottle.       

When I Google, I see that hydration is important in drawing blood. But the nurse found my vein immediately and had no issues. The appointment was very quick! 

I've had quite a few blood tests in the past and never have been advised to hydrate, so it's a bit out of the blue.

The blood tests are for two things: 
* I am getting my hormonal coil replaced soon and doc wants to check for hormonal changes/signs of peri-menopause before that appointment to ensure the best hormone therapy if so. (Genetic history of early Peri).
* I get sudden raised rashes in blotches all over my body that last for around 10mins before completely disappearing again. She thinks they are an allergy response and wants to check that via bloods. 

**My two questions:**
* How does hydration affect the results of blood tests?
* Are there any medical issues that could present the same as dehydration that they want to retest to rule out/confirm? 

Thank you!

","Hey folks! If you’re here, you’re probably wondering if Ashes of Creation is worth the alpha price tag. I’ll be upfront: there’s definitely a cost barrier, and we’re all a bit cautious about dropping our hard-earned money on an unfinished game. But here’s how I decided:

1. **If It Looks Fun & You Have the Funds** I say go for it! You really don’t need to watch 20 YouTube videos to min-max your experience right off the bat. Jump in, make mistakes, figure out the class you vibe with, and meet cool people along the way. That’s half the fun of a fresh MMO—exploring and learning as you go.
2. **The Cost Broken Down** Right now, packages hover around $100–$110 USD. If (and this is a big “if,” since nobody truly knows) the game launches in around 1.5 years, that’s like $3-ish per month if you factor in the included month of live game time and subscription credit. If you end up having even a few hours of fun here and there, that’s basically the cost of a cheap coffee per month.
3. **Beware the DX12 Requirement** Make sure your GPU truly supports DirectX 12—just installing it isn’t enough! Double-check. Otherwise, you might end up building a new rig like I did. (Mine was a 15-year-old beast that served me well, but it was definitely time for an upgrade.)
4. **Why I Jumped In** I was swayed by a creator called Pirate Software. I haven’t played a solid MMORPG since my days in PWI, and the combat footage intrigued me. I took a few days to think it over and decided, “Why not?” So far, no regrets!

At the end of the day, **Ashes of Creation** is what you make of it. An MMO thrives when people dive in, build friendships, discover new things, and share the journey together. If that’s something you want (and the price isn’t too steep for you), I’d say take the plunge.

# TL;DR Highlights

* **Game Style**: Open-world, node-based MMO with a focus on player-driven content.
* **Cost**: $100–$110 for alpha access (which includes a month of live game time + $15 credit).
* **Value**: Potentially $3 per month if it launches in 1.5 years.
* **DX12 Warning**: Check that your GPU fully supports DirectX 12 before buying.
* **My Reason to Buy**: Liked the combat, hadn’t found a good MMO in years, took a few days to think… and pulled the trigger!

**Question:** Did you decide to buy Ashes of Creation? What tipped you over the edge? Let’s hear your story! (Mine was mostly thanks to Pirate Software and my nostalgia for classic MMO days.)",1,1736347593.0,AshesofCreation,4,1.0,False

Hey all. 

33 - 190lbs - weed smoker - light drinker - daily 2x a day masturbator 

Back in August, I started getting symptoms after sex one time. Started with urge to pee then as things progressed it, turned into a fullness in my lower section and a dull ache in my testicle. 

I went and saw the urologist, and he immediately thought it was prostatitis, told me all my symptoms were exactly it, so he labeled it as stage two. Starting me off on 10 days of Cipro - after that didn’t work, I was going on a vacation for three weeks I visited his nurse practitioner as he was unavailable. She agreed with him and then diagnosed me with an additional three weeks of Bactrim, but after about 2 1/2 weeks I was still feeling some symptoms as some things were getting better, but some symptoms remain. now I am about two weeks post Bactrim and I still have a slight urge to pee, dull ache in testicle that comes and goes(but I haven’t had that for three days) and I had this weird pain near my bladder, but over two or 3 inches to the right that has kind of gone away also (noticed it more from working out) 

I’m going back to the urologist tomorrow and I’m wondering what other tests I should ask him for? All we have done is checked my urine which was all negative. he said he hasn’t sent out a semen tests in years and a lot of his colleagues also have not done this as it’s very “textbook”. If you guys think I should push for it I will.

The main thing I wanna make sure is, I have nothing else going on in my midsection so my big question for him is if I can get a testicular screening and then maybe a scan on my mid section just to make sure nothing else is pushing on anything, no weird growths. 

But I’m wondering, besides scans what else should I ask him for? I feel like he may want to put me on more antibiotics as he mentioned sometimes you need 6 to 8 weeks of it for it to go away, but I don’t know. 

I will say, I do feel better than when I started the antibiotics so maybe that did something? But I still have some residual side effects and I have read on here that some people feel the side effects Come back as the antibiotics just mask it but just wondering, what else should I ask for him to do? 

Ps - my urine test came back negative

- Dramatically cut back on marijuana (one puff a day)
- Have been doing pelvic floor stretches every morning for 4 weeks and every night for about a week. 
- Have barely been having sex, masturbation once a week. 
- Cut out coffee for a week as of now 
- Cut out alcohol for a week as of now

I currently have a 5 br 3 bath house but am ready to downsize after my kids graduate college. I would get no where near the money I need when I sell my current house, so just trying to get an idea from all of you about some options.

I’m a water drinker. I like other beverages alright, but throughout my life my go-to has been water with ice. I believe it’s a preference formed from millions of years of evolution and solidified by my being a form of life on planet Earth. I barely drink soda, don’t drink coffee, drink juice from time to time, and drink alcohol to get drunk. Otherwise, I drink water.

As a result I’ve put a lot of thought into cups. Now, a big cup is great. But the bigger the cup the quicker the ice melts which creates two significant problems – first, condensation around the cup getting your hands wet, and second, drinking warm water might as well be drinking piss. I want my water cold.

Enter the YETI 26oz Rambler Water Bottle – the perfect container for ice-cold water. Why?

First and foremost because it keeps the ice intact. Fill it with ice, add water, and you can leave it in your car in the height of summer for eight hours and come back to Antarctic ocean levels of coldness. Like you’re drinking from the depths of the Mariana trench. Same goes for golfing. I toss it in the back of the golf cart, sip on it throughout, and by the turn there’s still plenty of ice for a cold refill. Once that’s gone, there’s still enough ice for the ride home. I don’t know what kind of black magic YETI uses to keep the ice from melting, but if I’m going to hell as a result it’s a fair trade.

Second is durability. Let’s go back to the golf course. The YETI 26oz Rambler Water Bottle bounces around in the back of that golf cart like a psych patient with Parkinson’s disease. It may incur some scratches to the surface level, but those imperfections become picadilloes that make you love the thing even more. They let you know it’s yours. The structural integrity remains intact. My first YETI 26oz Rambler Water Bottle is old enough for second grade and it’s still going strong. You can throw it as hard as you can against concrete again and again and you’ll tear a rotator cuff before the YETI 26oz Rambler Water Bottle will crack open.

Finally, finesse. This all comes down to the handle at the top. You can carry this water bottle with nothing but a curled pinky. On top of that, the handle is engineered perfectly to prevent the leak-resistant straw cap from touching anything unsavory outside of your lips. You’d have an easier time solving a 3D puzzle than getting the straw to end of the straw to touch something by accident when it’s safely tucked in the non-drinking position. For a non-practicing germophobe like myself, that’s the kind of security a Stanley simply can’t replicate.

In terms of size, do I wish it was a bit bigger? Don’t we all. But the 26oz is a fine measurement requiring fewer refills than a standard 12oz cup. Let’s just say that while I take a couple more trips to the sink throughout the day, I’m getting my daily recommendation for H20. These pipes are clean.

I keep a rotation of three YETI 26oz Rambler Water Bottles in-house. Green, Blue, and Grey. It allows me to use one for a day or two then switch to another, and by the time I’m on my third the dishwasher has run a load and the others are clean again. I don’t drink water out of anything else these days as a result, and I couldn’t be happier.

Now, something to note is that when I purchased these all of the caps were black, so mine are interchangeable making things much simpler in terms of coordination. Since then YETI decided to make the caps the same color as the bottle. It’s a fucking travesty and not one I’ve taken lightly. If these things weren’t indestructible I’d purchase the latest model just to destroy it in protest. But since I haven’t taken the Captain America Soldier Serum, I’ve simply written letters to let YETI know my position every week on the week since the switch was made. No answer yet, but I’ll know they read them when we go back to uniform caps. Otherwise one small lapse in judgement could result in walking around with a blue bottle and green cap. Imagine the ridicule. No one would take me seriously again. Luckily I got in before it all went to shit.

All that is in the name of transparency, however. Don’t let it dissuade you from making this purchase and switching to the Rambler lifestyle as I have. I promise you won’t be dissapointed.

My alarm didn’t snooze itself into oblivion, I made my bed (a rare feat), and even brewed a perfect cup of coffee. I thought, Wow, I’m really nailing this. Then, I decided to tackle the mountain of laundry I’d been ignoring for weeks. I sorted it, loaded the washer, and felt a sense of accomplishment watching it spin. But an hour later, I opened the dryer to find… nothing. The clothes were still in the washer, soaking wet, because I forgot to transfer them.

No problem, I thought, I’ll handle it. Except that while I was rewashing the load, I decided to clean the kitchen. I lit a candle for ambiance—and promptly forgot about it while I went out to grab groceries. 

Cue me returning home to a burnt-out candle, a smoky kitchen, and the realization that my laundry was still sitting in the washer for the second time.So here I am, eating cereal for dinner because I also forgot to thaw the chicken, wondering if there’s an adulting handbook I missed out on.

For the last two years, I also published an edition of Last Year in Collapse about the Environment. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to write a round-up about the environment, although I did start it. My end-of-year was incredibly busy, and a comprehensive summary of our climate & biodiversity problems was simply too large to tackle. It was also too psychologically taxing to re-process so many developments in a short period of time. I hope to publish a round-up of 2025’s environmental developments at the end of this year.

Thank you all for your comments, upvotes, feedback, resources, and engagement in 2024. I started this newsletter just over three years ago to help make sense of the chaos of Collapse. Many of our problems feel too large, too fast, too complex to understand or follow. 

Yet we must examine them, place them on timelines and dissect them if we are to better understand what is to come. Everything is connected—and everything is falling apart. The flood of (mis)information now threatens to wash us away with it. I hope this newsletter has helped you in 2024, even though it may not have been good for your spirits. New developments in this blog are coming in 2025 and beyond—slower than expected.",10,1736346461.0,collapse,0,0.92,False

Understanding diamond cut is crucial for making an informed purchase. Here are the key takeaways:

* Cut quality is the most significant factor influencing a diamond's beauty and brilliance.
* A well-cut diamond reflects more light, enhancing its visual appeal and perceived size.
* AGS Ideal and GIA Excellent cuts generally offer superior light performance.
* Cut refers to craftsmanship and light interaction, while shape describes the external profile.
* Prioritize cut quality to maximize sparkle and overall satisfaction with your purchase.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Engagement ring shoppers looking to maximize diamond beauty within their budget

* Anyone wanting to make an informed diamond purchase decision

# Who is this not for?

* Buyers primarily focused on carat weight over quality
* Those with very limited budgets who may need to compromise on cut
* Collectors of fancy-colored diamonds, where different cut considerations apply

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Prioritize cut grade over other factors for maximum brilliance.
2. Aim for AGS Ideal or GIA Excellent cuts when possible.
3. Consider round brilliant cuts for optimal light performance.
4. View diamonds in person or through high-quality imaging to assess sparkle.
5. Compare similar diamonds to appreciate differences in cut quality.
6. Don't sacrifice cut quality to increase carat weight marginally.

# FAQ

Q: What's the difference between diamond cut and shape?

A: Cut refers to how well the diamond is faceted, proportioned, and polished to interact with light. Shape is the outline of the stone (round, princess, etc.).

Q: Why is cut considered the most important of the 4Cs?

A: Cut has the biggest impact on a diamond's sparkle and visual appeal. A well-cut diamond can appear larger and hide slight color or clarity imperfections.

Q: How are diamond cuts graded?

A: GIA grades cuts from Excellent to Poor, while AGS uses a 0-10 scale with 0 being Ideal. Both consider factors like proportions, symmetry, and polish.

Q: Can a lower color or clarity grade diamond still look great with an excellent cut?

A: Yes, a superior cut can make a diamond with slightly lower color or clarity appear more brilliant and beautiful than a poorly cut diamond with better color or clarity.

Q: Are AGS Ideal and GIA Excellent cuts the same?

A: Not exactly. AGS Ideal is generally more stringent, representing the top tier of cut quality. Many GIA Excellent cuts would not meet AGS Ideal standards.

Remember, while cut is crucial, the best diamond for you balances all factors - cut, color, clarity, and carat - within your budget and preferences.

Editor's Note: I'm currently writing a comprehensive book on diamond buying that dives deep into every aspect of the industry. However, I understand that sometimes you just need quick, actionable advice without wading through pages of details. That's why I'm sharing these focused 500-word guides – each one delivers key facts and practical recommendations in a format you can read over coffee. These articles distill essential insights from my extensive research, stripped of industry jargon and marketing fluff.

Her voice was at least one decibel louder than anyone else's in the vicinity, strong posture, seemingly ultra capable, confident and declared herself knowledgeable in many subject areas. The first play date went mostly without incident, apart from pick up being an hour late due to a delayed train in London. The next time I saw Sarah was at a Sunday laser tag party my eldest Florence and her youngest Ella had both been invited to. At the drop off I was quickly (and without being asked if I wanted to), whisked away to the nearest cafe where I was treated to a latte. Twenty minutes later I discovered that she has an IQ of 145, spent two years in the Navy, is a successful talent agent, has a husband who is commander of a super yacht and an actress daughter. I asked questions and sounded suitably impressed in all the right places. I felt like this should be interesting. Learning about someone else's glamorous life over coffee. Why was I so bored? I checked my watch. Thirty minutes in only half way through the party. I went to the toilet to kill some time. I texted my husband Pete, 'This is the most boring coffee I have ever been on this is dragging like crazy. I would rather be at the party with all the screaming kids.' Could I suddenly remember that I had some shopping to do? I looked at my watch, 5pm, damn it all of the town centre shops were shut. Reluctantly I went back to the table. 'Should we walk back slowly?' I proffered. 'No we will be way to early' Sarah scoffed 'I will have another black Americano.' Round two was a series of photos of birthday cakes that she had made for her children over the years, her eldest daughters acting head shots and a low down of her upcoming auditions. Once back at laser tag, and after the birthday candles were blown out, I was out of there like a shot with Florence trailing behind me breathlessly asking 'mummy why are we in such a rush?'. Never again, I declared to myself as I pushed the car ignition. Never again.  
  
At the school run on Monday and I positioned myself over on the far side of the playground away from the gate, hopefully invisible behind the throngs of other parents. I glanced at the gate. Success she was chatting away to the headmistress, although the conversation seemed rather one sided, and the headmistress seemed to be staring straight ahead, expressionless. Drop off complete, I scurried home past the park cars, suddenly a car door opened on the the pavement in front of me and blocked the narrow gap. It was a Volvo. Sarah beamed over the car door. 'I am so glad I caught you. Lunch at mine this Saturday? Bring all of the children, and a bottle of wine.' She laughed merrily 'Oh and make sure they bring their costumes. We have a pool.' Well it did sound like fun, and the children don't know anyone in the area. Someone who wants to drink wine on a Saturday afternoon may be right up my street, and I could always make my husband drive. Had I misjudged her? I mean a second chance couldn't be that bad an idea.

However, don't want to spend 60 - 100€ on the [barista hustle bowls](https://baristahustletools.com/products/the-cupping-bowls). There are also cheaper knock-offs on AliExpress but I also don't really trust those and would prefer ceramic in general.

In theory, simple ceramic bowls can be very cheap, like less than 1 € per bowl. I'd prefer something like 180 ml but haven't really found a good fit for a good price.

I found those bowls at IKEA [https://www.ikea.com/de/en/p/ikea-365-bowl-rounded-sides-white-80282996/](https://www.ikea.com/de/en/p/ikea-365-bowl-rounded-sides-white-80282996/) which cost 1.50 € per bowl but they are relatively small and only hold 130 ml when filled to the brim. Including the coffee grounds I'd say about 100 - 110 ml is a realistic amount of water. At 1:17 that would be about 6 grams of coffee per cup. 

Do you think 6 g of coffee to 100 g of water is a viable amount for cupping?

On the bright, side it saves beans which is nice for expensive coffee or small amounts like from coffee advent calendars and when cupping at home I also don't need that much liquid per coffee.",5,1736345962.0,pourover,12,0.78,False

1hwl8l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1hwl8l5/stress_on_relationship_during_pregnancy/,Stress on relationship during pregnancy ,"My wife and I have been getting into a lot of arguments lately due to all of the stress surrounding pregnancy. We went though IVF and were lucky enough to get pregnant on the first cycle. This is our first child.

I know all of this has taken a toll. There are a lot of hormones surging and the mental stress that accompanies every piece of it. 

For background, my wife is a small business owner and things are at a point where she really just schedules people to work and responds to messages. I work full-time from home and typically spend my day on calls or working on the computer. 

With my wife's work situation, she usually sleeps in and then heads to the couch for the day and watches TV or plays games on her tablet for the remainder of the day. I know she hasn't been feeling well, but this has been the routine for a few months. 

I wake up early, feed the animals, make us both some coffee, and get started with my work day. During the day she will not get up from the couch and constantly is asking me to get stuff for her. Yesterday as soon as one of my work calls ended she was yelling upstairs for me to come kill a bug. Once I'm done with work, I feed our animals, take the dog on a walk, get in 20 min of exercise, make dinner, and pick up the house. I usually don't sit down until maybe 8 each night. 

My wife tells me this is normal and keeps saying all of her friends husbands do the same. IS it normal?

I'm struggling because all of my sisters worked and raised multiple kids during pregnancy which requires a person to be very active. I also struggle because before pregnancy, things were similar. I timed once when she was begging me to get her a water, that she went 4 hours sitting on the couch and would not go get herself a water...even though she was so thirsty. 

I would love some more perspective. I'm more than willing to help out as much as I can ....but should there be more balance? ",1,1736345897.0,pregnant,14,1.0,False

There was a guy at a coffee shop who kept making eye contact with me and I shrugged it off because Germans like to stare. Given the holiday spirit though, I decided to be brave and went and talked to him. 

I told him I liked his haircut and asked where one can get a decent haircut here (genuine curiosity, haircuts in my city suck) and afterwards, I got his number. 

To my surprise, he texted me and said ""It was nice meeting you"" and after I'd asked if he'd like to get coffee sometime, he said he'd love to. He's busy at the moment but told me shit like ""I'm glad you texted"" ,"" I hope to see you soon"" and ""I'd love to spend some time with you"". 

My host mom says no straight guy says that and he's interested in me. She also says no German guys just give out their number like that unlike there is interest. 

Yes, I could just ask him and I enjoy being blunt but I'd prefer not to ruin a potential friendship with such a question.

I’m looking to meet some new people in the area and break out of my homebody cycle (I want to blame covid but it has been almost five years so). I’m 25, work as an analyst downtown and go to school part time. 

I’m socially awkward at first, but once you get to know me, I’m super relaxed and friendly. I’m into video games, mostly cozy farming sims, but I’m open to trying new stuff too. I’m a hobby half-asser or multi-hobby dabbler, depending on how you look at it. I’ve tried yoga, dance, knitting, gardening, painting, and more. 

My go to hang out thing is grabbing coffee but I’m also happy hitting up a bar. Outside of that I’m a fan of hiking, festivals, just watching a sunrise, and exploring local events.

I’m in bed by 9 most nights, but I’m always up for the occasional late night out. I’m always up by 7 so if you want an early morning coffee friend I’m your person! I’m child-free but totally cool being friends with people who have kids. Pro-LGBTQIA+ and non-judgmental—I’m just looking for good vibes with cool people. You don't have to be in my age group and we don't have to agree on everything. 

Some other things I’m into:
* Baking and cooking 
* Watching anything from documentaries to Craig of the Creek to Momtok to Only Murders in the Building
* Thinking about getting back into the gym, so if you need a workout or running buddy, hit me up!

Honestly, I’m just hoping to find people to experience life with—whether that’s a casual coffee meetup, texting buddies, or someone to go to a festival with. If any of this sounds like your vibe, send me a message!

We're planning on doing 3 days in Dublin, but want to rent a car and spend 2 days outside of the city. We're hoping to have some beautiful scenery, but also find a quaint, quiet place to stay (populated enough that we can get coffee / have a couple of restaurants nearby). So far, I've seen recommendations of places in Kerry, the West Cork area, Donegal, and Clare (specifically Cliffs of Moher). Is one of these areas better than the rest? Or maybe a different one all together? Please let me know if there's a specific town as well you'd recommend to get a place to stay!",2,1736345760.0,irishtourism,5,1.0,False
