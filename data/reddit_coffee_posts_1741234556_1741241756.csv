1j4p3gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Packout/comments/1j4p3gp/a_little_review_of_the_new_milwaukee_packout/,A little review of  the new Milwaukee Packout compatible Bluetooth jobsite speaker (From a giveaway winner),"Hello all, this post might be a little late, but I wanted to test out the speaker on a few different jobsites with different environments before I gave my feedback.

First of all, thanks to Milwaukee for this amazing giveaway!

I tested out the speaker first on a job where we were pulling wire through some existing rooftop conduits. I placed the speaker on this site at one end of the roof, and was listening and working mostly from the opposite end, so I was using the speaker here mostly on 90% volume or so.  
It performed well given the huge open space and lack of acoustics. The battery lasted quite well and really surprised me.

Next I tested it out at a local coffee shop we were wiring, so indoor and pretty small space, Here I was listening on lower volume Id say 50%, the battery lasted a long time again and really impressed me.

Just today I tested it out in a home we were redoing the wiring for, and WOW. This is where the speaker really impressed me. I used it all day with my 2.5CP Battery on about 40% volume(many other trades were on site and I did not want to be rude). The battery life is the first thing I noticed but what I absolutely love about this speaker is the woofer. The Woofer they have put in really makes a difference and I strongly believe this speaker really shines when not at full volume. Even using it for 7 hours straight my battery was still at 4 bars! I was able to cut drywall with the speaker attached on my ladder with no worries at all about dust or debris. 

The thing that really stood out to me and I really love is the many options for mounting.   
Milwaukee includes a base plate you can screw to a surface and twist the speaker into which is awesome. Then there is also an included space where you can hang it on a screw on a jobsite(which I did at the coffee shop in the photo, its attached to a self tapper on a metal stud). As if that isn't enough, they also have a ring that swings out of the bottom which is how I attached it to my ladder and carried it around with me around the residential house today.

Needless to say this speaker is replacing my UE Wonderboom that I carried around to jobs which I would always be cautious of dust and debris. I love attaching the new speaker to my packout that is in my work van.

1j4p30v,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoberCurious/comments/1j4p30v/choosing_low_abv_beers/,Choosing low ABV beers,"Apologies if this is the wrong place for this. I've been drastically reducing the amount of alcohol I consume recently due to hangovers and depression, but have not gone totally sober.

I'm a social drinker and mostly drink in bars. One small change I've made is many bars will list the ABV of their beers. I will choose the lowest one, often around 3.5%. It may sound obvious, but these beers have a third to half of the alcohol as other beers. I can have one, and a seltzer water or coffee as my second drink, and I will be set for a few hours, and have consumed a small fraction of the amount of alcohol I previously would have with 2-3 beers at 5-6%. I feel great the next day and can enjoy some beer, but in serious moderation that my body can process and doesn't inhibit my judgement. 

Alcohol is a drug, and understanding the dosage helped me become more aware of what I was putting in my body. ",1,1741241612.0,SoberCurious,0,1.0,False

1j4p0gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1j4p0gk/made_a_huge_mistake_today_confronting_my/,Made a huge mistake today confronting My Narcissistic Asian Father,"Without going into superfluous details, I pointed out that he could get his point across without being wantonly mean. That was all. He started going on a tirade about how he's always been the provider (Like that gives him a right to verbally and emotionally abuse everyone. I never asked to be born, I never asked you to have children), and throwing sarcastic remarks about how I was a once in a millennium kind of genius who knows everything. Then he proceeded to accuse me of colluding with the house-help to undermine his authority. 



All the while, I was trying to point out that he could ask for what he wants without hurting others feelings. Even something as simple as an apple, will result in ""You people never listen to me"", ""You think you know everything"", ""Fine, I will shut up. I won't say anything"", ""You all want me to be a dummy, anyway"", ""It's your reign, what can I say"", ""You'll know when you're my age"". All of this before someone can get up and cut one for him. The same thing with his morning coffee. A hundred depressing outbursts before the milk can boil. The milk doesn't care if you're 20 or 60, if it needs 10 mins, it needs 10 mins. He'd rather extra rice, be tossed in the trash, but will not make up his mind about wanting or not wanting lunch. So, food should always be ready. I hate him so much. 



I don't know why i lost it today. It's all my fault for that split second lapse in judgement thinking I can actually talk and get through to him. It was like I was screaming into a vacuum. Then the most embarrassing thing, I couldn't hold back tears. Here was a man, who was supposed to be my father who hasn't even talked to me continuously for an hour in all my 27 years of existence, tearing me down, criticizing me, and assuming things about me. He doesn't know me. He's always resented the fact that I was born a girl instead of a boy. I couldn't stop the tears, and that gave him more ammo. Frankly, after that I couldn't keep a cool head, I started yelling and for the first time in my entire life, I threw a spoon across the room. Because he wasn't even listening to what I was saying. And this whole argument, I might spoken like 7 whole sentences. 



The funny thing is, I read the gospel, ""It's not you"" (Book about Narcissism). I knew how ineffective and damaging it is to confront a narcissist. But in that moment i lost it. This is all my fault. I should have never even tried. What was I even thinking? His response was so text book, he employed DARVO (Deny, Attack, reverse victim and offender) like a champion. I can't believe I did this to myself. I can't believe i cried in front of my greatest adversary, my father.

After all, MM is bought for life. 

Since we (because of the baby) currently have different rhythms, the amount of coffee has been reduced. I now usually do 600ml and drink one half in the morning and I take the other with me to work. Small amounts with the MM are known to not be so ideal. From 500ml it still fits well, from my opinion.

This morning, however, I really only needed 300ml. I filled 300ml of water with 18g coffee. I didn't put the carafe underneath. The filter holder has absorbed the amount of water and I set a timer for 2 minutes. Then I put my normal coffee cup underneath and activate the drip stop by hand. It was a delicious cup of coffee.

1j4otnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1j4otnd/atelier_playa_mujeres_honest_review/,Atelier Playa Mujeres Honest Review,"Just got back from a 6-night 7-day trip to Atelier Playa Mujeres in Cancun.

tl;dr -- loved it. Not perfect, and the food was not as good as maybe I had dreamt, or thought I had heard. But overall the food was good, drinks were plentiful, staff was great, property and room was great!

I had the luck of visiting the French Laundry this year, and also In-and-Out in the same trip. I love well-made and well-prepared food, and I cook as well. I chose Atelier as I had heard it is some of the best food at an All Inclusive.

The food at Atelier is good, but very hit-or-miss. Some was under seasoned or just not well thought out or even amateurish plating. Some plates and dishes were just outstanding on their own. The braised meats at the Mercado 19 were almost always excellent, while the charcuterie was basically cheapest available at the grocery store. The alcohol was plentiful but you really had to know what was good and ask for it by name. When I tried to make a cocktail with Woodford the bartender shamed me a few times before finally capitulating. Not like I was a horrible person, just asked me if I was sure more than once. The cut-your-own bread loaves were really good, but the baked goods at the coffee shop were terrible.

I went to Hyatt Ziva Cancun a few years ago. Similar experience, though I liked Atelier's property better. I think the food was about the same, though I liked the Hyatt's snack bar a lot, and thought their coffee bar was better. And they had some better alcohol options (I love 1921 Cream Tequila - it was available at Hyatt, not at Atelier). I think Ziva was 1.5x the price though, and Atelier was great for the about $650 per night we paid for 2 people.

Great little snacks in the room, and a fridge full of alcohol, water, sparkling water, some OJ, etc. There was wine in the room and they gave us some Champagne. Honestly the wine and champagne was pretty disappointing across the board. You could buy wine, and given what they offered by the glass, I could see why. When there are bottles that are $18 that are so good, why serve total crap? OK, it was fine, but just not as good as one would hope.

We booked through AmEx Fine Hotels and used points. It was about 65,000 points per night, thus the $650 estimated cost. We booked for Feb 26-Mar 4 about 6 months in advance. Got $150 Spa Credit, room upgrade, and early checkin / late checkout.

Took USA Transfers for USD$65 for 2 people from Cancun Airport to the Hotel, and took Uber back to the airport for about USD$40. Just gave our Room Number to the Uber Driver so they could get on property. Picked us up at the front door, no issues.

Some thoughts, highlights, and advice:

\- Avoid Rooms 2205-2215 - they are above the gym and restaurant, and the noise of dropped weights will wake you up between 5-7am. Probably avoid whatever the room numbers are across the hall too. Get the 5th floor if you can methinks. 4th floor is a good alternative.

\- Room 2498 (2nd building, 4th floor) was great -- easy walking access to everywhere. Overlooks an open area outside the dance club, so lots of noise at night though. I just put my earplugs in and it was fine.

\- Building 3 seems to be much quieter, but you are further away from the non-quiet pool and beach.

\- I thought the breakfast buffet at Mercado 19 was better than La Consentida. The breakfast at El Suspiro (salmon benedict) was pretty good, but a bit cold, but eggs were runny at least! El Suspiro had the best vanilla lattes. 

\- Cafecito you only get a single shot of espresso unless you say otherwise. Be very specific in your drink order, do not expect your Starbucks order to come the way you like! And adding Vanilla flavoring, specify your shots, otherwise it will be weaksauce.

\- I think for building 2 if your room ends in 50-99, you'll be facing North over the golf course. Between 01 and 49, you'll be facing south overlooking the garden. Maybe rooms 40-49 will overlook or see the east end of the pool. I didn't pay enough attention to the room numbering for Building 3. Building one is pretty nice, I think all Inspira.

\- DO NOT GO ON THE INSPIRA TOUR unless you want to spend USD$30,000 in pre-booking your vacations. Or you don't mind spending 2.5 hours per person to get a couples spa massage or something. I had better things to do.

\- You can't really see the Sunset, even from the Inspira Rooftop Bar. But hot-tip, From the Rooftop Bar, if you walk to the south and into the rooms 1511 hallway, walk across the lobby, then you'll see stairs going up. There's a service door that is unlocked that will open to the roof. You might get a decent (and private) view!

\- Best Meals

1. Cilento - The Grana Padano pasta was quite good, as was the lobster fusili. The carpaccio was solid, the Negronis well made, etc. You can skip the calamari.
2. Los Abrazos - Interesting Salad bar, I got the Rack of Lamb and it was the best meat I had during our 7 day stay.
3. Takeshi - The hamachi app was great, the spring roll was good, and the korean ribs were pretty darn tasty. 

\- Bring some USD. They say you don't need to tip, but everyone did. Generally USD$2-3 for poolside drinks/food service, $2 for breakfast/lunch, $5-10 for dinner. This is what we did, dunno if that's standard, cheap, or high.

\- The regular pool was still pretty chill and quiet. There were regular more loud ""events"" but they were mostly on the east end of the pool. The west end (closer to the hotel, away from the beach) was quieter west of the foot bridge.

\- Get the Pink Panther at the pool -- half Strawberry Daiquiri, Half Pina Colada. Yum.

\- Drinks are pretty weirdly inconsistent. If you know your mix, just go to the bar and ask them for it. They don't have the best liquor, but it is good enough. I swear they cut their drinks with water, but there is a lot of ice, it is hot out, and the plastic glassware does not insulate. Bring a tumbler and you may get more booze and less melted ice! Do not trust the bartender to know the name of the drink you want and how to make it well. 

\- The gym is great! Had everything one might need. Not all the machines, but you could make do. Make sure you know your Kilograms to Pounds conversions! (multiply by 2.2. e.g. 10kg = 22lbs)

He was telling me his doubts he had about us giving me an example like if he were stuck somewhere 2-3 hours away, he thinks I wouldn’t be there asap. I told him he’s wrong and I would be there. 

I’ve helped him in ways such as contributing money to his down payment, giving him rides whenever he didn’t have a car, and buying him groceries. I am so so hurt that he would ever say that. I don’t know if it was in the moment but it made me silent. I couldn’t say goodnight to him after that. cause wow. We have been together since high school and even past that. we know each others flaws and what good we’ve done for each other. so for him to say that? I’m not sure how I should react. He said he feels alone and just wants to be reassured and that’s what I try to do. lately, I have not been feeling the best. I’ve been on my period and my mood swings are terrible. I get irritated by everyone around me. so that may have affected his choice of words today… 

It’s just that I wish he would’ve thought about what he said. Whenever we argue, his demeanor changes completely. he’ll say things like “cry all you want. I could care less.” goodness. This makes it worst that I’m on my period.

Nespresso Vertuo pods are crazy expensive!! $1.33 per pod when you buy refills from Amazon. 
So I started refilling myself for .25¢ per pod! 
I bought espresso beans from Costco for $13 a bag. It lasts me over a month, you keep the pod and peel the top off, clean the inside out and then you get the resealable top from Amazon along with the contraption that seals it back on which is not expensive and then you grind your beans up, put them in the pod, reseal the top and then you have new pods for 75% of the price! 

.25¢ coffee a day instead of $6-$7 Starbucks daily 😁

If possible, I need men ONLY to post their thoughts on my crazy shenanigans. *(I feel like I went on a bit of a rant here so excuse me if there are any grammatical errors or repetitions.)*

There's this guy I saw the first day of class and I thought he was adorable and extremely attractive. He looks like he recently started going to the gym, you can see his back muscles forming. He has some cute chub around. He's older than your traditional students, maybe around 38 years old but still looks somewhat youthful. 

I'm also a non-traditional student, in my early 30s but they all think I'm younger since I'm the size of a child.

This guy, like wow. He dressed up for our first day on the field of our school internship program. He looked like an English teacher from the way he was dressed. His dress pants were a bit tight and so sexy like I'm sorry but that's distracting. I looked more than a few times when we were all together in class later that day. He sat in front of me and I just couldn't stop staring at him. It took me a while to realize I'm crushing on this guy. He's so nerdy looking, has tiny chub left and is so handsome.

So this whole time, he's wearing long sleeves and I'm able to look at him without losing my composure but there was this one time where I had to put my hand to my head to not see him because I'm stupidly shy around him and he was sitting next to me, not in front. I think this was around the first day of class if I recall. 

I went from accidentally looking at this guy's bum to starting to check him out, to realizing I have a crush on him to then avoiding looking at him because I completely lose it around him. It's like staring at the sun, it burns. There was one time I avoided him, he noticed and it affected him. I think I hurt his ego. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings but we were in a professional setting where students were doing testing. This is how that day went and how I effed up my chances at having a friendship with him.

One day students were doing practice testing and I was sitting in the back, bored and sleep deprived. Then through the doors comes this sunshine of a hunky man. He had this gently warm smile that almost stopped my chest. I was surprised to see him. I had prayed the night before to God to bless this generous man and hoped to have something with this man, even if it's friendship. And what a coincidence, he comes to where I am. Anyways, he comes to my direction and says he's happy to see a familiar face. I'm dying inside from him telling me this, like seriously? He's standing around and I tell him calmly to grab a chair to sit. As he sits, he takes off his coat and has this tight shirt where you can see his biceps. He begins to preen himself and I'm trying not to have a nosebleed looking at him. He starts to tell me something and I'm just dumbfounded that I just nod and have no idea what he's saying most of the time. Like how does this man have this affect on me. I'm here holding back turning red. As he talks to me, he looks deeply into my eyes. I feel like he's touching my soul with his eyes, like I was trying not to tremble from the nervousness . After a bit, the main teacher walks in and she moves to a reading on the smart screen. I take this opportunity to move myself away from him and to see the smartboard because I'm about to pass out from him. I here start avoiding him because I'm just flushed and it's obvious on my face. He notices I'm avoiding him and changes his mood. He was in my face earlier, all happy, warm, sweet and friendly, and that switched when I was losing my composure.



When we're done, I go downstairs to move to a different class and then I go to the main office to get some copies. This guy is at the main office, he's a bit behind in the program which is why he just entered where I was earlier. Then we made some quick exchanges at the main office, he was cool and I was also cool, relieved to be able to not be losing my composure since I'm no longer in the same room as him. But then, he proceeds to enter the other class I'm in. I'm like, shoot I'm going to explode. I was moving around in the class, avoiding eye contact as much as possible. My head was spinning. I'm a grown ass woman, I've never acted this way with any guy. Later he leaves super early and says he'll see me later in our other class.

I'm able to breathe when he leaves. I don't hate him, I just get overwhelmingly nervous around him. Then it goes downhill from here.



At our later class, he is intentionally late and I start to get nervous again. My speech gets a bit slurred because of my nervousness. We are assigned groups and OMG he's in my group. He goes and sits across from me. He doesn't make any eye contact and is cold with me here. He brings up that he might change his classrooms for the program we're doing. 

I'm here across from him, completely red. We do our work and when it's time for us to talk, we don't look at each other. Here I start to feel that he is ignoring looking at me. Then at the end, we all go back to our original spots and everyone is leaving. I see him just start, starting at his bag standing by his desk. He doesn't move and I have to pass him to leave, he's just there with this sad look. I wanted to say something like bye or I'll see you next week or even apologize for my chaotic behavior but I was a coward and just left.



I tell my ""friend"" about what happened but I don't tell her that I'm crushing on him. She is also with him in another classroom for our program. They spent more time together but she's much younger than him. She said he hasn't said anything to her about me other than he might want to change his classrooms. She also quickly brushes the topic off making me suspect she is also crushing on him. She innocently says ""at his age"" this is nothing. Okay girlie.



Then I saw him the following week. I wanted to apologize this week and start fresh. My ""friend"" comes in with him behind her. They were coming back together from getting coffee. I've never seen her drink coffee. My friend had the nerve to sit next to me and then he pulled a chair to sit next to her even though the table end was for two people, he squeezed himself next to her. She had the nerve to look at me, smile and ask me something she's never asked before because it's a topic I know she doesn't care about. I felt jealous seeing them have the same drink and being close next to each other. I know from the look on her face that they probably talked about me since I told her most of the things that happened.

Anyways, the three of us are in a group together and I felt like I wasn't even part of the group. He gave my ""friend"" all his attention and they didn't even bother looking at me nor interacting with me about the group work we had. I was like a ghost.



The class ends and I just leave right away, this isn't how I thought things would go. The guy didn't even say hi and he was right there. Like I was really hoping to just apologize but I felt like he was ghosting me in person. I felt like crying, me a grown ass woman. I went home so furious, jealous, then sad. It's all crazy. There is no going back. All because I was crushing on this guy and my body was clearly exposing it in an inappropriate space.



Men, how do I proceed? What do you think? I'm a mess, this is childish, and I don't know how to hide my emotions as a human adult. Send help asap.

I met her when I first moved to this town from across the country with my partner 3 years ago. We both have children, I (30F) have a 2 year old and she (35F) has a 13 year old. She had shared custody of him with her ex husband since he was young, maybe 3. 2 weeks ago, the kid decided he wants to stay with his dad and not do the transfers biweekly between towns. She's heartbroken of course. 

She's been in between jobs and struggling to make ends meet so I've been helping her out with some loans and always pay for her when we meet up for coffee or lunches, also gave a generous giftcard for groceries for Christmas. 

I feel as though our friendship has been skewed for a while. I often times feel like our hangouts are therapy sessions and she dominates the conversations with her troubles. I get it, as a friend I want to be supportive but it really does feel like it is all about her. When I speak, she is found to be fiddling, staring off, or talks over me. Being a mom too, I thought she would be more supportive of me postpartum. She wasn't. I saw her maybe 4 times in a whole year being postpartum. I don't have much support here in the new town besides my partner. I'm halfway through my second pregnancy now and she has barely made any attempt to ask how I'm doing or managing this new chapter. And yet all the while, always claims that she is thoughtful and appreciative of what I do for her. I feel as though I am always the one carrying the friendship by checking in and making plans.

She recently has been chatting with a guy online who apparently has had 3 children with 3 different women in the past 10 years and has little to no contact with them. When she told me this, I immediately said that is a huge red flag and he is probably not a person you want to invest your time in. She was offended by this. She doesn't have a good track record of previous relationships.
I've been trying to comfort and support her through the change in her custody and when I reach out to make plans, she's ignored messages and blows me off but I see she has continued to make plans with this guy. 

She says that I lashed out on her about the guy and I scolded her and her choices.

1j4ofol,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1j4ofol/barrys_espresso_bakery_and_deli/,"Barry's Espresso, Bakery and Deli","I opened the door to Barry's and saw there was no line, it's a small local Jewish bakery that's always crowded in the mornings, getting there at 2pm meant dodging the line of Boomers who always make the place part of their weekly routine. There's a nice atmosphere, always with hi-resolution photos of nature and wildlife photography on the walls which were otherwise white and simple.

Anyways, there was a song starting up on the stereo, you know the one, ""Out here in the fields... teenage wasteland..."" Somehow, it pulled me back, and I remembered the last time I saw my friend Will there, I'd walked in just the same, when he saw me from his table in the back corner, and yelled out, ""My Mayor, get over here man!"" Will always called me ""Mayor"" ever since I'd first ran for office. He was f\*cked up, huge smile plastered on his face which was flushed red, barely managing to avoid falling out of his seat sideways. He was happy to see me, but he also knew that talking with an acquaintance significantly lowered his chances of being thrown out of the bakery by the nice 19 year old girls who worked there. The entire scene was hilarious and I grinned from ear to ear knowing we were being judged by everyone in the shop.

He told me he'd just gotten his dose of suboxone increased and then proceeded to pull out some rolling papers and a bag of weed to roll a joint, he was spilling herb onto the table, someone was going to have to sweep that up later. He had a massive half-eaten sandwich on the plate in front of him. We had the same taste in girls but never competed for the same one, we both liked nice things and mocking our own upper-middle economic class. Boomers were giving us the side-eye from every direction, but smiling to themselves because they knew we weren't causing trouble, and seeing some 90's kids slack off a bit helped them feel their own age less. Will was a great guy, funny, kind, always gave me over-the-top compliments, he was one of the only people as committed to getting high as I was. We'd met in a class called ""Healthy Choices"" back in high school, 15 years earlier, it was a class they put kids in who were at risk of failing to graduate, it was kind of like a real-life version of ""The Breakfast Club"", which was the movie that we ironically got to watch as part of the class.

That was the last I'd seen him, 3 years ago, and he'd died about a year after that. Overdosed on a bad batch of fentanyl, right after completing rehab and moving to Portland. Things were so disconnected from Covid lockdowns I didn't even find out he was dead until a year later, seeing it was his birthday, February 14th, I'd sent him a message to hang out and wished him a Happy Birthday, just to see a reply from someone else that Will was gone.

I got to the front counter, the girl working asked me, ""Do you know what you want?"", the first thing that came to mind, ""I want my friends to stop dying..."" I thought to myself, and my eyes felt weak as my chest in that moment, the song picked up in the background, ""...Don't cry, don't raise your eyes..."" and I pulled myself together to make the order, 12oz house coffee, one coffee-lemon finger, and a bowl of tomato soup (my ex-girlfriends favorite).

I knew what I wanted.

Clearly, I was wrong. ""Do you want the coffee finger, or the lemon finger? We have coffee or lemon but not one that's both."" She said, and I had to smile a little, being corrected by a woman always cheers me up somehow. ""Just the regular lemon finger, thank you."" I replied, and went to sit down at the table I was reminiscing about, they'd served the soup immediately so I didn't have to wait for anything.

After sitting down, I was lost in thought again. Watching steam rise from the soup, I thought about life, my hopes, dreams, fears, and then... I looked up. There had been an overcast cloudcover all morning, and in the minutes after sitting down the sun had baked through the clouds to reveal a prominent, vibrant rainbow, thick bands of rich color, and it seemed to hover directly above the butchershop across the street, maybe 30ft above the pavement. In that moment, I didn't feel so alone, the coffee was great, the soup was perfect (as always), the challah was soft and buttery, the lemonfinger was rich and creamy, in that moment, it didn't feel like such a burden to think of wanting to share a meal with someone, it didn't feel like such a burden to think of my life, just clarity, there were decades of challenges behind me, and decades of challenges ahead, but that moment felt like an endorsement from life to take on the future.",1,1741239152.0,writers,2,1.0,False

So I am three days into the diet and I wanted to ask about bowel movements and what can cause diarrhoea and or constipation. I know for someone who has been on it for such a short time this is my body transitioning although I wanted to ask what affects bowel movements.

As for example: Day 1:  
Hard boiled egg 90, rindless cut ham 60g and flaky salt, 3L water. There was no bowel movement whatsoever and a little bit of bloating. All good, no discomfort.

Day 2: I got peckish

3 boiled eggs, 90g rindless cut ham, 1 fried egg and, rock salt 1 Nescafe black coffee with a little bit of butter, 3L water. I had the RUNS all day.

Day 3 (today):

3 fried eggs, 127g blue oyster steak, 72g rindless cut ham, rock salt, 2 servings of nescafe black coffee without butter. I have had no bowel movements but \*extremely\* bloated and have drank 3L of water.

Is this due to a higher protein consumption compared to fat consumption? Or is this just a general transitioning and what can I do or expect when it comes to bowel movements? I would like to keep regular, or at least decrease bloating. I know for today I ate a lot more but the benefits of today was that I have felt the highest amount of energy in the longest time although this bloating was putting me off and still is, I know it's common practice to drink coffee to alleviate or act as a laxative but also I do suspect my sodium consumption to be a factor to the bloating and (stool) build-up?

For activity wise I keep up with the 10k steps a day, but today I did 15k and I had the coffees at two seperate times.

Finished in 2021, 'Confes[SI]o[NS] of a King' is the oldest of my paintings, having been a staple on the walls of Olde Towne Coffee and OTBX Downtown in Huntsville, AL.

It's the last piece I signed with my actual name before I embraced the title of yumedyne entirely.

It's one of the few pieces where I incorporated words in the front-paging piece rather than just the hidden back pieces. I wanted to capture the sense of paranoiac dread I felt living in America, drawing from the alphabet-soup organizational acronyms in 'Typewrite Lesson' by Cornelius, the hubris of the titular Doctor Frankenstein in Mary Shelly's novel, the inseparable nature of war and America detailed in Cormac McCarthy's 'Blood Meridian', pontifications on the violent nature of humanity in 'I Feel Better' by Hot Chip, the ominous hidden machines and indifference to the chaos they bring in 'Pull Up the Roots' and 'Girlfriend is Better' by Talking Heads, the feeling it'll never truly end embodied in 'Hey Orpheus (It's Never Over)' by Arcade Fire, and the corruptive nature of power in 'Slumlord' by Neon Indian.

It encapsulates feelings I still hold about American identity, our ties to wars across the globe, our complicity in genocide in places too far away for us to consider those being killed as ""one of us"". And now as I did then, I worry that, instead of changing the system, the system is changing me.",1,1741238349.0,artstore,0,1.0,False

1j4o5d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1j4o5d2/is_it_time_to_divorce_my_wife/,Is it time to divorce my wife?,"Hi all. Need advice. I've reached a point in my marriage where I am just exhausted from years of emotional struggles. Me (41M) and her (46F) have been married almost 8 years, and I can only think of a few months early in her pregnancy where things were calm and fun and great. She agrees.

The short short version: we got married, moved to her home country 2 months later, tried to have a baby. Struggled with infertility. She had 2 ectopic pregnancies from IVF in 3 months, which led to her having an emotional breakdown (#1) which required her to visit a mental health clinic for a time. We got through it.

Then she got pregnant naturally, had the baby. Already during early pregnancy our intimacy started declining, because she just wasn't interested. I put it down to hormones and worked with her and didn't make a big deal out of it. Then the baby arrived, my wife just threw herself 100% into being a mom, and I started feeling neglected. Our intimacy was low, sex life also basically zero. Our kid was co-sleeping with her while she breastfed so I slept in a different bed for the next year almost. I started resenting her.

I'll mention my wife is a SAHM, which is what we both wanted.

Due to lack of sleep when my daughter was around 6 months old, my wife spiraled again into a mental health crisis (#2) where we needed to fly my mom out to help us look after our baby so I could keep working and my wife could rest. Resentment grows.

I posted elsewhere about 6 months ago regarding the struggles we were having around not agreeing on [having a second child.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1f8tjlt/wife_wants_a_second_child_desperately_i_dont_2/) That was mental health crisis (#3). My wife is still struggling to accept that reality. She resents me deeply for not giving her a second child. I resent her more for how for over 2 years she couldn't take ""no"" for an answer, and how she couldn't see my POV as valid. She thought I was just wrong and needed to be convinced.

We went on a family vacation recently and she again couldn't sleep and when we came back she again visited the clinic (#4).

We keep having these awful deep conversations where she recognizes what she puts me through, she recognizes that I don't get the attention, affection, and love I deserve, and she wants to do better. She wants to stay married. I'm just so tired of this situation. I fantasize about just being by myself (when I'm not with my daughter of course) and not having to have these conversations. I'd rather be by myself than like this.

We went on a date yesterday. We went for coffee and to a movie. It was painfully awkward because of the undercurrent of everything we are dealing with and constantly talking about and mulling over. She told me that if I want to leave, she would completely understand it, even though she doesn't want me to.

We have a 3.5 year old. I am afraid of what separating will do to her, even though I'm perfectly aware that my wife and I are not modeling the kind of healthy relationship she needs to see. I take extremely seriously the advice I got in that other thread I linked that our home is already broken.

I feel like I've failed. So much therapy (individual and couples), so many books read, so many podcasts listened to, so many deep heart-to-heart conversations. It wasn't (or hasn't been) enough. I don't want to fail my daughter. I worry that I am just going to make a selfish decision that I will regret that will hurt her in the long run. But at this point, I just don't feel like I want to try any longer.

1j4o00p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j4o00p,Bolivar Germany 30th Anniversario,"I have been banned on the Cuban Cigar sub due to a post in which I wanted to offer 10 cigars as a prize for the best content. It seems that was against the rules, so will not be posting that again, and will continue the contest in another forum. I am waiting on moderators to let me know if I am allowed to post a link to the forum in which I will post the contest, I certainly don't want to break any more rules or cause a disruption to any of the cigar subs, the exact opposite of my intentions.

As such, I am going to post here for the next 2 weeks. Yesterday I chanced upon a porcelain box that was released in 2019 and decided to give them a try as I find the Bolivar Belicosos Finos to be 

I remember the retailer had informed me the cigars themselves where standard Belicosos Finos, no special tobacco or special processing such as additional fermentation or ageing. I felt they where a good buy though as they must have chosen the best cigars from that years batches for a celebratory release, the look of the wrappers and the smell confirms my assumption. In addition, at about 800 dollars per box compared to the 650 I usually pay for a box of BBFs, it was a very good deal when we consider the beutifull porcelain box.

Yesterday's cigar was an excellent excellent  example of what a BBF can be, it was not an elevated experience like a BBF Reserva with a different delivery and a more luxurious taste to the tobacco, just a very good BBF that has started the second maturation. 

For those that know the BBF well will know that they become a very different cigar as they go through their transformation sometime between 6-8 years of age. These have are on the verge of that transformation, and have started showing more complexity and finer flavors of vanilla bean and berries as well to its chocolate and coffee core flavour profile. The retrohale has a slightly herbal quality to it with the tobacco flavour being as robust and high quality as you would expect from Bolivar.

These where a great deal and I wish I had the foresight to get a few more boxes. ",1,1741237554.0,cigar,0,1.0,False

1j4nzfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1j4nzfg/spent_the_weekend_with_someone_special_and_i/,"Spent the weekend with someone special, and I regret it","I (36f) went on a weekend trip with this guy (43m). He lived abroad most of his life so he doesn't know our tourist destinations that well. We went to this tiny town that everyone who lives here has been to multiple times, and because it was a long weekend, everything was fully booked, so our hotel was far away from the town's center. 

I liked him for almost half a year, but I've known him for years, he is one of my favorite artists and he has a very niche IG account. We met in person last year and we were both awe struck about each other when we met, like I couldn't believe how handsome he was in person and he kept asking me to hug him, I could feel him smelling my hair. 

I went to visit him while I was abroad in his city back in January, and when I saw him he totally tricked me into getting to his apartment and well... We ended up doing it. But I didn't want to catch feelings for him, so I decided not to visit him again while I was in his city. 

He then decided to come visit here for the long weekend. He's pretty handsome and definitely draws female attention to him, and he always tells me about all the girls that approach him in public. I guess he wants to make me jealous? Anyway, I punch back and I tell him about the guys I date. Dumb little game, I know. 


So, this weekend we went on this trip together, since he doesn't know his way around I had to be on top of the booking. I booked two separate bedrooms. My plan was to have a nice weekend with him and NOT GET ATTACHED, because tbh he's way too handsome and I don't think I could manage all the jealousy that comes with having someone like him as a partner. 

The getaway went ok, We couldn't get our hands of each other, but my poor planning skills ruined some parts of the trip and he was noticably irritated, but didn't blame it on me. I ended up knowing him better, we had long talks, he was very sweet to me. He showed me some of his work unedited. We talked about our childhoods and  all. 


At some point he said something like ""I know that for you this is something superficial"" , and when I asked him what he meant he said that he knew I was there for the sex and that I only used guys for pleasure. I told him that I actually had admired him for years and that I wasn't at all interested in sleeping with him when we first met, I was just so glad to meet one of my favorite artists. And I did tell him I cared deeply about him, but I knew that I wasn't special for him at all either, and I had no reason to believe he wanted anything else than just having a good time with me, as he is surrounded by beautiful woman all the time, I was just the flavor of the week. He seemed a bit offended by that comment , he said he doesn't  see girls that way and that he only opens up to someone special. We agreed that we both like each other and we both café for each other , so that the best thing would be to take advantage of the time together, and maybe do physical stuff while we still can when we have the chance, but remain good friends until we're old. 

I don't know, it was a weird conversation and i can't shake the feeling that he was just trying to make me say that I was in love with him or something because of his narcissistic nature. I have shielded my heart from guys like him years ago because I know falling for them doesn't ever end well. 

Anyway, at the end of the trip we couldn't get a bus back to our city and he got pretty mad. I felt awful and I wasn't looking forward to spend the next 3 hours next to him being mad. But he explained to me that it was just his survival skills, nothing personal. He went back to being all touchy feely and even told me he had referred to me as ""his wife"" to some lady who asked him who I was to him. I told him he was full of it, I knew he was just trying to manipulate me. He fell asleep on my lap for most of the trip , holding my hand while I caressed his hair. He drooled on my pants and he was so embarrassed haha so sweet.

And then.... Once we arrived and left the bus, he just asked me if I could get a bus to my place from where we were. Plain and cold. I said yeah , so he just turned around and said see ya then! No kiss, no hug, nothing. I called him out on it, he turned around, gave me a small peck kiss and then went away. 

I was just in awe about how he could just shift from being so sweet to basically abandoning me there like as I was some stranger. 

I think thats what really bothers me. We shared some good moments, and I opened up about my feelings for him. I told him that maybe we couldn't be good as a couple because neither one of us is willing to settle down, but that I did want him in my life as a friend as I admired him too much. And he agreed! But the way he left me there just made me feel like he never really cared. 

And I am here now as a 36 yo woman crying like a teenager because I feel I lost someone I was really starting to care about. 

I know I can't get his heart , I'm not special, I'm not as pretty , and I am old, so I don't even entertain the idea of him ever falling for me, and I know, I knew since we started this whole thing to prevent myself from getting hurt.  but I did want to be able to maybe go out with him for coffee and talk about art for years. I wanted a friendship. 

I'm so confused. 

I guess I just wanted to write about it and get it off my chest so that it doesn't eat me anymore.  I don't want to, and I also can't tell my friends because he is kind of famous in our circles (and one of my best friends told me he was a major player so I should stay away from him), and I'm kind of embarrassed of how it played out. 

I miss him. I messaged him a few hours after I got home back from our trip, he just put a heart react on my message and that was it. I don't think I can push it anymore, I should wait for him to write me, and I'm dying thinking he might never write again. Ah well, I ended up being hurt despite all my efforts not to.

These places are close, but they somehow seem very different but I don't have the experience to know what those key differences are.  Do you?  Priorities are:

\-- Safe, less sirens, less crime than where I am now  
\-- Leafy, Friendly, Community Vibe right outside my door.  
\-- Not a dead zone.  Don't mean parties, just people out and about (not just locked in APTs).  I'm single.  I'm sort of an ambivert who likes  first and foremost to be able have good safe outdoor fun with my toddlers right near home; but also feel energized by an active community vibe with people, dogs and runners out and about; duck into a good bar or coffee shop social scene, and then retreat into my introverted cave :)   
\-- Lots of toddlers/young kids and good playground within walking distance  
\-- Walkable to coffee shop and other lively things

Lanier has Walter Pierce Park which looks amazing but area seems colder -- being close to AdMo is a plus for fun but a minus for crime.  The north half of Mount Pleasant is beautiful and peaceful, seems full of families, but incredibly quiet (like where is the community?) .  Also, MP only has one teen-tiny playground, but good access to Rock Creek Park trail and Zoo along Klingle.

Tom had been working at his new company for just over a month. Fresh out of university, excited, and eager to prove himself, he had landed his dream job as a junior developer at a big tech firm.

There was just one small problem.

Though Tom spoke English pretty well, sometimes—just sometimes—he would mix up words in ways that didn’t quite… work.

But hey, nobody’s perfect, right?

# The Big Meeting

One day, Tom’s manager invited him to a very important meeting. Not just any meeting—*the* meeting. The CEO, the CTO, senior engineers, and all the important people who ran the company would be there. It was a chance for Tom to learn, network, and show he was a promising young developer.

There was just one problem.

Tom overslept.

By the time he realized the meeting had started, he was already five minutes late. He sprinted down the hallway, laptop in one hand, coffee in the other, a combination that guaranteed disaster. He slid into the conference room, panting, sweat dripping down his forehead.

# The Moment That Changed Everything

Everyone in the room turned to look at him. The CEO, a serious-looking man in his 50s, raised an eyebrow. The room was silent.

Tom knew he had to say something to break the tension. Something professional. Something that would show he was serious about his job.

He took a deep breath, looked directly at the CEO, and confidently said:

**""Sorry, I'm retarded.""**

Silence.

Complete, absolute, deafening silence.

You could hear the WiFi signal bouncing off the walls.

Tom blinked. The CEO blinked. Everyone else exchanged wide-eyed glances. A junior manager choked on his coffee. One guy looked like he was about to pass out.

For a brief, eternal moment, time stopped.

Then—

**BOOM.**

The room *erupted* in laughter.

The CEO leaned back in his chair, laughing so hard he wiped away a tear. The CTO slapped the table, gasping for air. A senior engineer nearly fell off his chair. One guy had to leave the room because he was laughing so hard he couldn’t breathe.

Even Tom’s manager, the person who had vouched for him, had his face buried in his hands, shaking with laughter.

The CEO, still trying to recover, wiped his eyes and said:

*""No way. No way did I just hire a retard to work on my company’s software.""*

The room *lost it again*.

# Damage Control

Tom, realizing his mistake, turned bright red.

*""No, no, I meant… I'm late! Sorry, I'm late!""* he stammered.

But it was too late. The damage was done. He had just labeled himself the ""official retard"" of the company.

For the rest of the week, every time Tom walked into the office, someone would greet him with:

*""Hey man, don’t be late again… or, you know… retarded.""*

Even the CEO got in on the joke. At the next all-hands meeting, he looked directly at Tom and said:

*""Let's all try to be on time. And if you're late… well, you know the drill.""*

Tom wanted to disappear into the floor.

# A Happy Ending?

Over time, Tom learned to laugh at himself. He became known as ""that guy"" in the company, the one who had made the *greatest* meeting entrance in corporate history.

And you know what?

He got promoted six months later.

Why? Because even if he made *one* tiny language mistake…

At least he was *smart enough* to fix actual bugs.

Moral of the story?

The boy from the stars who breached my shores is called back home. Our time together sweet, joyous, passionate, everything I’ve adored. Taken just out of reach. There are 18,720 minutes until his forced departure. 
We sleep and the sorrows come to visit my door pulling songs of weeping from my heart. When day breaks we linger in bed feeling each other’s flesh as I memorize each Angels kiss on his skin, the muscle fibers stitched together by God, noting the patterns of his breath.
He makes me coffee, I make him eggs and the sun brings laughter through the windows. We howl into the afternoon light as if previous days have returned to us. 
The night comes again and I sob into my hair. Why does my soldier have to be taken from me. Life has become so good and now only visions of battle lie before me.

It’s happened quite a few times recently that I sit down after a long day of this shit and genuinely wonder what’s wrong with me. 

TLDR I’m clumsy, can’t remember very basic things that I also AM remembering, and generally feel like an idiot. Help?

The longer version:

I have wondered if all of this stems from some underlying anxiety about something when it’s happening at times but I don’t think so. 

So I (23) have been acting very dumb lately. For example yesterday at work. I dropped a plate that exploded and hit my leg, somehow splashed the coffee pot I was carrying and burnt myself, and later at home tried to stand from an awkward seating position without realizing my leg had fallen asleep (when I tried to put weight on it my body rolled forward onto the tops of the toes of that foot and bruised). I also spilled silverware from a fresh set onto a customers lap, dropped menus on a few different customers, and more I’m sure, I can’t remember. But it’s not just the silly off day. 

Yesterday morning I also just knew in my mind that it was Wednesday so I knew I didn’t have work. My boss calls me at 3:50pm like hey where the hell are you you’re scheduled for 20 minutes ago. Absolute face palm, it’s actually Tuesday. I wake up today and ALL DAY am thinking about how I have certain plans with my friends tonight because it’s Thursday. I remember in passing at one point no it’s Wednesday actually because of xyz reasons. Then proceed to go back to assuming it’s Thursday. I drove to the meeting place, tried to open the door to the building and it was closed because surprise it’s actually fucking Wednesday. 

The problem is, this has been all day every day for months. I drop things, trip and slip, run into corners, 
Forget how old I am, how to spell basic words, can’t recall simple math and it feels like I’m losing the plot completely. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to stop acting and looking like a complete buffoon???

It was a really great relationship until I was accused of cheating and nothing I said or did would prove otherwise. We had moved in together at the time and that evening, he packed his things and left. We had been working on things and I got the dreaded “hey girly” message one day and found out he was trying to patch things up with an ex while actively working on things with me (or so I thought. He claims we weren’t). I had a hunch there was someone else because his text demeanor changed. His responses became very short, and he showed a general lack of interest in small talk with me. Since then, we’ve been off and on for about 5 months and recently went no contact for about 6 weeks. I broke the no contact and emailed him which then led to us texting the past couple of days. Nothing deep just things like greetings and what we were up in the day. I noticed the familiar lack of interest and short responses and my gut immediately felt he was talking to someone else. In earlier messages I asked if his lack of talking was from being guarded or something else and he never answered my question. For me, no answer is an answer and that answer is usually that I’m right, in this case it was the something else I was feeling. I asked if he was in a place emotionally and mentally if he wanted to meet up and talk. There’s a ton more background like alcoholism and lies, but I’ll save that for another day. We met for coffee and our conversation didn’t seem very productive from my perspective. He didn’t want to revisit the things that happened that led to no contact so I changed gears and was trying to get him to open up about what direction he wanted our relationship to go. Whether it was forward as friends, nothing at all, or trying to work on rebuilding trust and being together. At the end of coffee he walked me to my car and we chatted a bit more but it was cold AF so we agreed to FaceTime when we were back out our respective domiciles. Instead of calling he sent the first message you see.
Am I overreacting in my responses to him? Do I come across as trying to be emotionally manipulative or am I valid in what I said? I understand tone is difficult in text but I was trying to be gentle and supportive of his new talking stage person.",2,1741236393.0,AmIOverreacting,38,0.63,False

1j4noaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1j4noaw/yogurt_as_an_egg_substitute_for_brownies_and/,Yogurt as an egg substitute for brownies and blondies...,"Someone suggested using yogurt as a binder in baked goods in lieu of eggs to save $$$. The suggestion led me to remember yogurt being an ingredient in some baked goods, though an egg would be added too. I thought I'd give this a try, though omitted the egg, preferring to save them for the occasional omelette - TBF, scrambled eggs, as I can't fold em properly - or poaching.  

Through Google, found out that 1/4-1/2 cup of yogurt is the equivalent of a large egg. I chose Fage's 2% lactose free Greek Yogurt, as it was on sale, though probably should've gone with the full fat regular version - being lazy, went with the 5.3 oz cups. Used 2 cups for the brownies, thinking 10.6 oz would be more than enough, but the mixture required more liquid, so used 3 cups for the blondies. I prefer my blondies and brownies to be more cakey than fudgey, so no issue with the batter with yogurt looking/feeling like bread or low to medium moisture pizza dough when spooned into a 9 x13 pan vs batter with egg as the binder - no difference after being baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Some claim yogurt imparts a tangy taste, but I couldn't detect it, though I added 2 and 3 tablespoons of instant coffee and cinnamon to the blondies and brownies respectively - YMMV with your palate.

There are other alternatives, like apple sauce, but strained yogurt is cheaper ATM, especially if purchased in larger containers, but YMMV. I consume a lot of yogurt, so one less thing to haul back home is a plus and there's no dairy shortage ATM. A few days ago, I found Trader Joe's stocking a dozen organic extra large brown for $5.49 and a dozen extra large regular for $3.99, though the limit was one per customer.

1j4nnxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1j4nnxk/team_building_pt_2/,Team Building Pt. 2,"I was being chased through an endless maze of putrid, ancient wooden doors. Some kind of glutinous entity was biting at my heels. Sweat poured profusely down my face as I shouted obscenities into the darkness.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck! Oh shit.”

Every door I pulled on was locked, dreadful sounds emitting from beyond. I had to find an exit. I rounded a corner, knowing the thing was creeping closer by the second. I could hear what sounded like whips covered in black oil, wiggling and searching behind me. 

I snuck a glance over my shoulder as I sprinted further down this seemingly endless hallway. Just in time to see a massive tendril snaking around the corner, followed by two dozen more. Two sanguine-colored eyes penetrated the darkness inside them with gleeful excitement. A horrific creature long forgotten by time willed itself fully into view. Its tendrils were spread wide now, licking and whipping every inch of the hallway as it bounded after me at a slow, steady crawl. They left behind a thickening, foul slime trail as it slithered ever closer, its murderous intent palpable.

I finally reached the end of the hallway—the last door to try. My last chance.

Locked.

I pounded on the door frantically.

“God fucking damn it!” I shrieked, to no one in particular.

I knelt, hands on my knees, wheezing through the offensive stench that hung heavy in the air, trying to catch my breath. The whipping of too many appendages grew closer, and the rancid scent grew more pervasive with each passing second. It smelled like someone had slurped up vomit and thrown it back up again.
There was nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide. This was it.

I turned from the door, steeling myself and accepting my fate. I raised my arms in front of me, mustering up all the strength I had left.

“COME ON!” I howled with everything I had down the nightmare alley.

The vociferous whipping sounds increased to an overwhelming frequency as the entity appeared before me in its unholy glory. The cracking and slithering of tendrils reverberated against everything around me. The walls seemed to fracture attempting to confine the monstrosity within its borders. I fell back into the door, grabbing my ears to keep them from exploding under the booming echo of horror.

Suddenly, the door behind me swung open, causing me to lose my balance and tumble out into the night air. The back of my head hit the pavement with a crack. 

I heard, in the blackness, the hulking wooden door slam closed with a gust of air.
A harrowing cackle erupted from the other side.

“Well done,” it echoed giddily through the door, and I felt something warm pool behind my head before everything went dark.

The call came in the middle of the night.

Unluckily for me, I had been something of a night owl since getting let go from my job a year earlier. The bills were piling up, and the meager unemployment I had been collecting wasn’t going far enough. At that point in my life, I would’ve taken anything that paid. And I did. I did everything I could to scrounge a living for myself—from painting houses to driving trucks for pay under the table. So, when the call came in the early hours on that Monday, I was already on my second cup of coffee, perusing the wanted ads out of pure desperation.

My cell phone began to ring, much to my confusion. A number I’d never seen before—or since, for that matter—flashed across the screen. I considered it for a moment and thought, fuck it.

I picked it up after the fourth ring and was greeted by an affable voice.

“Hello?” I said curiously.

“Is this Trenton, Cooper?” The voice actually said “comma.”

“Ugh, Cooper Trenton. Yes. Who is this, please?”

“Good morning, Mr. Trenton. This is Albrecht Von. I am the CEO of Dunwich and Co. My call this morning is to inquire if you would be so inclined to interview with us?”

I mean, technically, it was morning if you considered four a.m. to be morning. I personally considered it nighttime, but people in business keep weird hours. Who was I to judge? After all, I was awake as well—and desperate.

I scoured my mind for a memory of applying to the aforementioned Dunwich and Co., but the brain files came up short. I had applied to hundreds of jobs over the past year, so my forgetting one of them wasn’t necessarily outside the realm of possibility.

“Oh, good morning to you too, sir. I am very much interested in an interview,” I exaggerated. I had learned long ago not to shoot a gift horse in the mouth, and I was out of options.

“Positively wonderful. Please bring with you an open mind and a willingness to prove yourself. I will have my secretary email the particulars momentarily.” With that, the line clicked and died.

I found myself standing before an architectural marvel of a building made entirely of concrete the very next morning. It reminded me of Medusa’s hair, the way the sharp edges protruded every which way, almost like a crown. I had arrived fifteen minutes early—something I had done before every job interview over the last year. If it ever helped my case, I’ll never know for sure.

As I pushed through the uninviting aluminum door, I entered what could only be described as a small, innocuous lobby. Little more than an apathetic, tiny room greeted me, a stark contrast to the view from outside. Paint-chipped, monochromatic walls and a mundane desk with a frighteningly pale auburn-haired woman sat sentry ahead of me. Her head was down, almost like she was sleeping, with her hands flat on the desk. To my right was a row of decrepit wooden chairs and an ancient-looking wooden door. I glanced up at a dim, flickering dome light, which seemed to lure and release a family of moths in a never ending dance.

I hated to say it, but even with this place being creepy as all get-out, this wasn’t the worst place I’d interviewed at in the whirlwind that had been the last year of my life. Times were tough all over.

The lady behind the desk suddenly jerked her head toward me with an unnatural, eerie smile. She looked like one of those marionette dolls with the long lines down the side of her mouth. Her sudden movement caused me to stumble a step back. Her eyes were a dull, greyish hue, and it felt like she was looking but not seeing me.

“Name?” she asked bluntly.

“Hi, hello. Cooper Trenton. I’m here to—”

“To see Mr. Von. Have a seat,” she interrupted flatly. Her arm jerked robotically toward the chairs against the wall, then fell limply back down with a thud onto the desk. Her eyes turned away from me, and her head slowly moved back down. The smile never fell from her face.

I took a seat without another word, eyeing her cautiously.

I waited for another fifteen minutes. The woman never lifted her head again until a smartly dressed man with slicked-back blonde hair and piercing green eyes walked in. His suit looked more expensive than the entire lobby.

“Mr. Trenton, it is an absolute treat to… meet you. Albrecht Von.” I stood to grab his extended hand. “I hope we didn’t keep you waiting too long.”

The only thing that was too long was his index fingernail, which was turning a slight shade of purple. The woman behind the desk twitched in my peripheral.

“No, sir. Not long at all,” I answered. He noticed my eyes drift to the woman behind the desk. I thought maybe she was watching something on her phone, but from what I could see, her desk was completely empty. Not even a pen was anywhere in sight.

His eyes shifted for a second to the woman, and I could swear I saw them turn a dark black, but when he turned them back on me, they were a bright green again.

The pale woman just continued to smile at us.

“Thank you, Audrey,” Mr. Von said almost expectantly. He studied me for a moment, and as the moment passed us by he continued. “If you’ll follow me, please, Mr. Trenton.” He opened the ancient wooden door and flicked his index finger over his shoulder, as if to say, this way.

He closed it gently behind us and glided across the floor. The hallway we were in seemed familiar somehow, like I had been there in a dream of a dream. I followed closely behind Mr. Von, passing closed wooden doors on either side with faint sounds coming from beyond.

I almost ran into him as we reached yet another wooden door at the end of the winding hallway. He pushed it open with ease and ushered me inside with wide, eager eyes and a grin plastered too wide on his face. I could feel him oozing anticipation—for what, I had no idea.

As we stepped inside, I felt a slight gasp escape me. There were gorgeous paintings adorning every wall of the room, floor to ceiling. I was momentarily impressed by the sheer volume of these beautiful creations, all gleaming under the warm lights. As I scanned the portraits, one in particular paralyzed my eyes—and then my mind. It was a portly man in his mid-forties, saluting in a too-big sailor’s uniform. It stirred in my brain like someone had taken a whisk to the back of my head, searching desperately to find a connection. A devastating migraine hit me like a battering ram, wave after wave of pain. My eyes shut tight against my will, unknowingly pressing them together as if that would somehow squeeze my brain out through my eyelids and end the agony.

Vivid images flashed like a reel in my mind, over and over again.

a painting of a knight kneeling before a hooded creature.

An auburn-haired girl, 

an armory, 

I grabbed the back of my head, feeling a pitted scar running six inches vertically down to the nape of my neck.

Mr. Von quietly locked the door behind him, positioned himself in front of another door on the opposite side of the room, and turned on his heels to face my pitiful, shaking form.

I forced my eyes open through the agony, just in time to see Mr. Von’s index finger slowly rising to meet his shit eating grin. 

It was a sickly midnight color, and several inches longer than when he’d beckoned me to follow him only moments ago.

Something about that finger felt so familiar to me—something long buried in my mind.

“Welcome back, Cooper,” Mr. Von said excitedly.

His temples were crinkled, blonde hair sheets were tapping his beard. The air smelled like it should have, algae and rotting everything else. And when his pole trembled in his hand, he insisted it was arthritis. He never had arthritis.

Later that morning, his jittery fingers, his silverware dropping meant sweaty fingers and “too much caffeine.” And when he dropped the coffee pot? “Alcohol.” A fearful man is one who claims to have been drinking at 9 a.m. when he hasn’t been- it wasn’t on his breath, he wasn’t slurring, and he wasn’t a good actor. I do wonder what he believed was really happening to him. 

My twelve-year old sister did, she wondered. The eyes of a man who just called his daughter by his great Aunt’s name have the vulnerable essence of a baby left on a porch, of innocent souls losing. The kind of unseen enemy that bypasses your perceptions, that has no interest to waste on making you a monster- not always, not in Dad’s case- is this one that’s growing amongst our family right now. Now, at this moment, at this table, it’s eating his potato. He’s not eating it.

His brain scan was passed around the family, extended, this one. Don’t look if you get the chance. Three sloppy, knotted black holes are where the once middle barely is. Around it are stringy little half ribbons of brain that look two-dimensional compared to the outline of a healthy brain. A healthy one is thickened, robust, like firm snowflakes. Dad’s looks like the lonely, fatigued branches on a winter tree.

So, rather than whining further- “it takes more pollution to whine, then a solution,” he sometimes says- used to say. So. We’re playing catch. Only- he keeps calling me Dad. He thinks he’s a kid. I went with it. Actually, I have not been correcting him all day, and Mom despises me now. 

She says I’m sadistic. She says it’s cruel, and I’m sick, and I’m treating this monster like a punchline. I don’t think that’s true, though. He deserves the memory he’s yearning for. It’s not about me, none of this is. If he wanted to play with me, he would have called me “son.” 

We’ve been playing for three hours that way. He’s smiling. His eyes still have light, and so do mine. Because there’s more to a human than their brains. And more to a family than our monsters.

Some kind of glutinous entity was biting at my heels. Sweat poured profusely down my face as I shouted obscenities into the darkness.

“Fuck, fuck, fuck! Oh shit.”

Every door I pulled on was locked, dreadful sounds emitting from beyond. I had to find an exit. I rounded a corner, knowing the thing was creeping closer by the second. I could hear what sounded like whips covered in black oil, wiggling and searching behind me. 

I snuck a glance over my shoulder as I sprinted further down this seemingly endless hallway. Just in time to see a massive tendril snaking around the corner, followed by two dozen more. Two sanguine-colored eyes penetrated the darkness inside them with gleeful excitement. A horrific creature long forgotten by time willed itself fully into view. Its tendrils were spread wide now, licking and whipping every inch of the hallway as it bounded after me at a slow, steady crawl. They left behind a thickening, foul slime trail as it slithered ever closer, its murderous intent palpable.

I finally reached the end of the hallway—the last door to try. My last chance.

Locked.

I pounded on the door frantically.

“God fucking damn it!” I shrieked, to no one in particular.

I knelt, hands on my knees, wheezing through the offensive stench that hung heavy in the air, trying to catch my breath. The whipping of too many appendages grew closer, and the rancid scent grew more pervasive with each passing second. It smelled like someone had slurped up vomit and thrown it back up again.

There was nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide. 

This was it.

I turned from the door, steeling myself and accepting my fate. I raised my arms in front of me, mustering up all the strength I had left.

“COME ON!” I howled with everything I had down the nightmare alley.

The vociferous whipping sounds increased to an overwhelming frequency as the entity appeared before me in its unholy glory. The cracking and slithering of tendrils reverberated against everything around me. The walls seemed to fracture attempting to confine the monstrosity within its borders. I fell back into the door, grabbing my ears to keep them from exploding under the booming echo of horror.

Suddenly, the door behind me swung open, causing me to lose my balance and tumble out into the night air. The back of my head hit the pavement with a crack. 

I heard, in the blackness, the hulking wooden door slam closed with a gust of air.
A harrowing cackle erupted from the other side.

“Well done,” it echoed giddily through the door.

I felt something warm pooling behind my head and then blissful darkness.

The call came in the middle of the night.

Unluckily for me, I had been something of a night owl since getting let go from my job a year earlier. The bills were piling up, and the meager unemployment I had been collecting wasn’t going far enough. At that point in my life, I would’ve taken anything that paid. And I did. I did everything I could to scrounge a living for myself—from painting houses to driving trucks for pay under the table. So, when the call came in the early hours on that Monday, I was already on my second cup of coffee, perusing the wanted ads out of pure desperation.

My cell phone began to ring, much to my confusion. A number I’d never seen before—or since, for that matter—flashed across the screen. I considered it for a moment and thought, fuck it.

I picked it up after the fourth ring and was greeted by an affable voice.

“Hello?” I said curiously.

“Is this Trenton, Cooper?” The voice actually said “comma.”

“Ugh, Cooper Trenton. Yes. Who is this, please?”

“Good morning, Mr. Trenton. This is Albrecht Von. I am the CEO of Dunwich and Co. My call this morning is to inquire if you would be so inclined to interview with us?”

1j4ni95,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1j4ni95/realizing_that_nice_people_and_aholes_literally/,Realizing that nice people and a-holes literally experience the world differently,"This is probably not revolutionary knowledge to most but I just realized it tonight talking to employees in my local coffee shop next to my college.

In this coffee shop there are 2 frequent employees. One is a middle aged man, bad at english so he doesn’t talk much, but extremely warm and friendly, always tries to help when he can. The other is an older woman, always cold and angry at the students who visit, for instance with her we always have to scan our own products while she reads the magazine, and if we do it wrong she gives an annoyed snide comment like “guess I can’t help you then.”

Now I’m extremely unsociable, probably have avoidant personality disorder, I don’t talk much. But I always feel so bad if I ignore the nice man without a gesture even though I’m bad at it, so today as I was leaving I squeezed out a “have a good night”. He knowingly smiled and waved at me. But the older woman who was reading her magazine despite being at the cashier with me looked up not knowing who I was speaking to, and she cast me this skeptical confused look, before confirming I was not talking to her and giving me a sneer that said “typical” all over it. 

I was pretty embarassed so I said “and you too” and she rolled her eyes and ignored me. 

As I walked away I kept thinking about how the man was expecting me to say goodbye as soon as we made eye contact. In his lived experience, he probably thinks students are all kind young people, always smiling, making small talk, and happy to see him. 

On the other hand the older woman was shocked to think someone would say goodbye to her, and quickly confirmed I hadn’t addressed it to her, which only reaffirmed her belief that students are annoying and heartless. 

But here’s the catch. Given what she thinks people are like, it’s no wonder she’s mean and rude to everyone. She thinks the world is hostile and her job is awful, and young people are all rude and disrespectful, and no one likes her. That is all technically true, but only for her. 

The man has the exact same job, but in his equally real experience, everyone who visits the shop is so nice and grateful, and even though it’s not the best paying job he is happy to work here. He knows everyone would be so sad if he left. And it’s not just because he has a great attitude and ignores mean people, it’s because the same people are literally nicer to him than to the older woman. 

It makes me rethink all the people (including my dad) who proclaim that everyone in this country are all rude and cold hearted, not willing to make friends. If you ask him about his experiences, he tells me about shocking encounters where people are actually so mean to him, like store employees refusing to help him (discrimination, he calls it) or aquaintances who start ignoring him after one meetup, or strangers who make fun of him.

On the other hand, I have friends who are very social, who tell me that everyone is a nice person if you get to know them. That’s why they like meeting people so much and talk to folks on the street. They tell me that they’ve have friends who are unpopular/unconventional but actually super nice, and when you get to know them they are all just misunderstood. They think truly rude and unkind people are very rare. 

I’ve been trying my whole life how to gauge which account is true. But I never truly comprehended until now that both of their life experiences could be true, and not even because they interpret it differently with “the wrong attitude”. 

My social friend literally meets nicer people than my dad does, just like the nice man and the mean older woman experience the same customers differently. People literally treat the mean older woman with less kindness than the nice man, but she likely doesn’t realize it’s **because** she hates everyone that everyone is less nice to her. In her experience she probably thinks that she hates everyone because everyone is just mean. 

So yeah just a random revelation, thought I’d share. ",6,1741235801.0,self,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I don’t think any of us sat in undergrad thinking:

“You know what I’m really good at? Clerical work. I just love it. I can’t wait until I get to become a psychotherapist.”

And yet, here I am, locked in mortal combat with a pile of blank progress notes.

My very supportive (and extremely patient) boss recently suggested that maybe—just maybe—I should explore new tricks if I’d like to continue having a job. And you know what? I would. I really would.

Now, I know some of you have strong training in behaviorism. Me? I’m more… eclectic. But desperate times call for direct measures, so I’m testing a stimulus pairing experiment:

✅ The Paperwork Mug
	•	It will be filled with something I actually enjoy (coffee? kombucha? I really like kombucha).
	•	I will only drink my fizzy tea or brew while doing notes.
	•	Over time, my brain will (hopefully) start associating documentation with pleasant things instead of existential dread.

Bonus: Posting about my great success or inevitable failure on Reddit will be part of the process. What could go wrong?

Will it work? No idea. But at this point, I’m willing to let Pavlov himself coach me through my documentation struggles.

I have been wanting to grow myself as a professional, gain more experience (outside my full time job), etc.

While I am optimistic, I am also trying to be realistic. I have a degree in psych but no licensure and because of that, I’m open to taking some sort of certificate or credentialing program that may help me market myself as more of a “professional”, for lack of a better term.

I am honestly kind of sick of people gate keeping writing different experiences??? Like what do you think the point of fan fiction is. Not every character is you. Diversity comes from writing different types of people and different experiences and different mindsets and philosophies etc. etc. 

“straight People can’t write gay relationships”, “women dont know how to write mlm”, “men writing wlw is inherently pervy”, “allos don’t know how to write asexuals”, “neurotypicals writing neurodivergence makes me uncomfortable”, “white people can’t write poc stories”, “if you havent experienced it first hand you CAN’T WRITE THE EXPERIENCE.”

  
STFU. SHUT your EVER LOVING GOBSTOPPER. PLEASE. 🙏 

RESEARCH! It exists! People aren’t private eyes or super spies or coffee shop employees or tattoo artists or fairy princes or murdering maniacs or—- like. Like. It’s fiction. It’s about putting yourself into someone else’s pov that’s why you study the character and their stories and traits and plot beats you’re supposed to figure out how they think. How they live. 

And and and! Even bad rep is a stepping stone to something more. I understand being frustrated with shitty portrayals of various, often important and/or vulnerable experiences but fuck man. They’re learning. Teach em then idk. But if everyone is only allowed to write about themselves, no one is going to Make You that rep. It got there by people fighting for YEARS, for themselves and OTHERS. writing about different types of people is a good thing idk how we circled around to this being a bad opinion??? 

And ofc… it’s. Fucking. FAN FICTION. Tf do you mean the rep sucks?? You’re the writer! Make your own! Turn the characters into poly neurodivergent lesbians, it is DIY time my friend! Turn that blorbo trans! ‘Blackwash’ the character! Who gives a fuck!
