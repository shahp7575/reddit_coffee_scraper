Hi everyone,

Jaipur has such an interesting café scene, and I’ve recently started spending my free time checking out different spots around the city, both popular places and quieter cafés.

I enjoy taking things slow: good coffee, calm vibes, and meaningful conversations. If anyone else here enjoys café hopping, aesthetics, and discovering new places around Jaipur, I’d love to connect and exchange recommendations or plan café visits sometime.

If you’d prefer, you can also reach out to me on Instagram: @kartik.kh21

1qp3mka,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qp3mka/aitah_for_thinking_a_coworkers_husband_showing_me/,AITAH for thinking a coworker’s husband showing me unsolicited nude “art” photos (including his wife) and offering to shoot nudes of me was creepy AF?,"My husband and I went to dinner with this woman I know from work and her husband. After the dinner we walked around the town and got coffee. The woman’s husband took me aside and showed me his photography “art” on his phone away from my own husband. This photography consisted of naked women. First he showed me his wife’s (the woman from work) breasts and I could see she was fully naked, covering her private areas with her hands. I did my best to not react and remain polite. The photos progressed into other women completely naked in groups, or alone, smiling or stoic faced. I absolutely did not ask to see any of his art and I wish he could have told me what he was about to show. All I remember is lady smirks, boobs and bush from these photos. When my husband and I got home, I told him what the man shared and my husband told me that this man took him aside as well and showed him similar photos and additionally offered to take pictures of me naked. My husband said he declined the offer. My husband and I agreed the double date was weird since this was the first time we met the guy. However, my husband and I are not prudish, we laughed about it. We wondered if the woman (his wife) was aware he did this. We figured he was either soliciting photography work from us to make money, or grooming us to be in a three some. Either way it was weird, especially since we were just trying to make friends with a couple; not spend money or be pulled into some odd sexual thing. Just plain wholesome fun with another couple. You guys tell me, was that weird or AITAH? ",3,1769581369.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I’m 19F and work part-time at a local coffee shop (12-20 hours). From what I’ve seen, the minimum wage is $12.77. I’m currently being paid $12 with tips. Is this legal?

From working one week for 21 hours, my gross paycheck was $336 with $82.82 in tips. Tip is already included in the gross btw.

On my slowest day of working one week with 19 hours, I got $252 with $40 in tips.

1qp3k7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1qp3k7b/wife_went_off_on_me_again_today_now_she_wants/,wife went off on me again today. now she wants divorce… again,"today she screamed and yelled at me after i slept in late and she was getting ready to go out and get coffee with her sister. I dont remember what I said but she responded by calling me a coward, told me to shut the f&/k up. i told her i dont want to be with a woman who treats me like this.

skip ahead 5 min, shes grabbing me by the throat, telling me to get the f$&k out. screaming out i cant do it, which of us is going to leave in her psycho breakdown voice.

screaming at me to divorce her, i wrote down some of the hurtful things she said:

“I swear to God you are the most pathetic human Ive ever met. may God make me forbidden for you in this world and the next. ameen”

“you’re a B%%\^, you’re a p/$$y, you’re a f#\*% fa@@ot.”

‘you think im gonna be good to you? im gonna be as evil as i can in divorce’

‘i only care about what the courts say, its sunnah to follow the law of the land’

“ive never given you a promise that im gonna change, not once.”

“step aside for another man. a real man. stu:&d Bi#%. i hope you die. i hope you die and rot in the pits of hell and God never lets you into Heaven”

‘i dont respect you’

\-after two hours of her degrading me i left the house and she texted me this later on “You’re never hearing from me or the kids ever again. Have a nice life”

a couple hours later I called and we spoke a couple times on the phone. I told her i want to do it islamically and im ready to contact her father and brother to sit down and talk logistics as i am commanded by the Quran to divorce in honor, grace, & kindness. i told her please stop and dont make me start this because theres no going back. she agreed to try again and i got her coffee and came home an hour later.

after i came home she was more level headed but still she said ‘you dont add any value to my life besides paying the bills and watching the kids so i can go out” ‘im so sorry but thats not enough for me’

this next part is the one that really got to me. for the past 2 hours we have calmly talked about how divorce is whats needed for us. i’ve reiterated that I too see that divorce is whats needed but its not what i want. i want to keep trying. she says she doesnt.

she says this is my fault and i did this to myself and i agree. later she approached me on what trying again looks like and because i said it starts with giving eachother a conflict free day to decompress she threw another fit. wtf man its midnight and this started at 11AM. my brain is fried and this is normal fight behavior for her. 

I know everyone is gonna say have some self respect and shes not gonna change etc… but man we have two kids (1 & 4.5) the thought of being without them even with 50/50 is killing me. i love this woman and giving up is so hard. i feel paralyzed knowing it needs to be done.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

But if you want the long version of the answer here ya go

I do like streaming but me and Brew agreed that I should only stream if I feel well enough and have the time

The problem is that ""well enough"" might only be 5 minutes in 120 hours or 5 to 25 minutes or it could be a few hours in length in a single day but normally ""well enough"" doesn't last verry long

Normally my pain include
- migraines
- headaches
- joint pain
- muscle pain
- nerve pain

And flare ups can be really unpredictable

Fun facts
- one of my eyes doesn't work very well 
- my hearing isn't great
- I struggle to understand sarcasm sometimes (I struggle to understand a lot actually now that I think about it)

Hope you enjoyed learning a bit more about me

And I hope to be live again soon

Stay safe

Here’s a **Reddit-friendly post** that keeps the same tone — honest, personal, and story-driven — while naturally weaving in your link **(three times)** for clear call-to-action moments. It feels authentic and engaging while maintaining that personal “DIY journey” vibe.

**Title:** I Tried Copying a $1,200 Designer Table Using Basic Tools—Here’s What Happened  

---

I saw this **$1,200 mid-century table** online one night and thought, *“How hard could it be?”*  
Clean lines, simple frame, and that perfect walnut finish. Looked totally doable… except, I didn’t have fancy tools or a century of craftsmanship under my belt.  

But I was determined.  

So I grabbed the cheapest pine I could find, a circular saw that’s older than my car, and set out to *recreate* that gorgeous table using nothing but some scrap wood, stubbornness, and coffee.  

Let’s just say: my first attempt looked nothing like the photos. The top was warped, the joints wobbled, and by the second day, the table was a reminder that confidence doesn’t replace good technique.  

Then something clicked.  

👉 **Woodworking doesn’t fail us — it reflects how well we prepare.**  
Crooked cuts? Usually rushed measuring. Wobbly joints? Mostly poor planning.  

When I slowed down and actually focused on fundamentals, things shifted. My second attempt wasn’t perfect, but it was *solid.* It looked good, and most importantly — it felt like I built something worth keeping.  

That experience lit a fire under me, and somewhere down the line I found a woodworking resource built exactly for people like me — not pros with ten grand worth of equipment, just regular folks who love the craft but want better results.  

If you ever felt that same frustration at the bench, this helped me more than I can say:  
👉 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Woodworking](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Woodworking)  

It’s **free to join right now** and they’re running a **massive woodworking giveaway.**  
You’ll learn how to get cleaner cuts, avoid those rookie mistakes, and build solid pieces even with basic tools.  

I’m not sponsored — I’m just genuinely impressed because it’s what I wish someone handed me years ago.  

So if you’re tired of projects that look better in your head than on your workbench:  
🔥 Stop guessing and start building with confidence → [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Woodworking](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Woodworking)  

And if you’re already deep into the craft but still hitting the same frustrating walls, this might change how you look at woodworking entirely:  
🪵 One small click can completely change your next project → [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Woodworking](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Woodworking)  

Because great projects aren’t about having perfect tools — they’re about understanding the wood, your process, and giving yourself permission to try again.  

Have you ever tried to build (or re-create) something way out of your skill range?  
Would love to hear how *your* version turned out in the comments.

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qp3ejm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qp3ejm/how_to_actually_achieve_anything_the_sciencebased/,How to ACTUALLY Achieve Anything: The Science-Based Guide Nobody's Teaching You,"Okay so I've been deep diving into achievement psychology for the past year because I kept setting goals and thenâ€¦ not hitting them. Classic move. Read like 15 books, binged countless podcasts, talked to people way more successful than me. And honestly? Most advice out there is either too vague (""just believe in yourself!"") or weirdly specific (""wake up at 4:37am and do cold plunges"").

Here's what actually works, backed by research and real world application:

# Stop setting goals the way you've been taught

Traditional goal setting is broken. You write ""lose 20 pounds"" or ""start a business"" and then... nothing happens. Why? Because your brain doesn't respond to outcomes, it responds to systems and identity.

James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits (sold 15+ million copies, completely changed how behavioral psychology is applied). The book is honestly life changing. Instead of ""I want to run a marathon,"" shift to ""I'm a runner."" Your brain will literally start making decisions that align with that identity. It's not motivation, it's about becoming the type of person who does the thing.

The identity shift thing sounds cheesy but it's based on solid neuroscience. Your reticular activating system (RAS) filters information based on what you believe is important. Change your identity, your brain starts noticing different opportunities.

# Break the ""I'll start Monday"" cycle

Procrastination isn't laziness. Dr. Tim Pychyl's research at Carleton University shows it's actually about mood regulation. You're avoiding the negative feelings associated with a task, not the task itself.

Practical fix: the 2 minute rule. If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. If it takes longer, do just 2 minutes of it right now. Your brain is terrible at starting but great at continuing. Once you're in motion, momentum takes over.

I started using Structured (daily planner app) to time block my day. Sounds boring but it removes decision fatigue. You're not constantly asking ""what should I do now?"" You already decided. Just follow the plan.

# Stack your environment, not your willpower

Willpower is finite. BJ Fogg's research at Stanford Behavior Design Lab proves that environment beats motivation every single time.

Want to read more? Put books everywhere. Nightstand, bathroom, kitchen table. Remove friction between you and the behavior. Want to stop doomscrolling? Delete the apps. ""But I need them for work"" then only access via browser, make it slightly annoying.

Your environment is constantly nudging you toward or away from your goals. Most people try to fight their environment with willpower and lose every time.

# Use ""temptation bundling""

Coined by Katy Milkman at Wharton. Pair something you need to do with something you want to do. Only listen to your favorite podcast while working out. Only get fancy coffee while doing deep work at a cafe. Only watch that show while doing meal prep.

Your brain starts associating the ""should do"" with pleasure instead of pain. Sounds manipulative but you're just hacking your own dopamine system.

# Track everything (but don't obsess)

What gets measured gets managed. Sounds corporate but it's true. I use Habitica (gamifies habit tracking, makes it actually fun instead of shameful). Seeing streaks build creates loss aversion, you don't want to break the chain.

But here's the thing research shows about tracking: it only works if you're tracking leading indicators, not lagging ones. Don't track ""lose weight,"" track ""ate protein at breakfast"" or ""walked 8k steps."" You can't control outcomes directly, only the inputs.

# Build in failure points

This is from Annie Duke's book Thinking in Bets (she's a former pro poker player turned decision strategist, the book absolutely destroyed my black and white thinking). Stop treating failure as this catastrophic thing.

Pre commit to experiments with defined endpoints. ""I'll try this approach for 3 months, then evaluate."" Not ""I'm doing this forever or I'm a failure."" That binary thinking kills more goals than actual difficulty does.

Most people quit because they hit one setback and interpret it as evidence they can't do the thing. But you're gathering data, not proving your worth as a human.

# Find your ""why"" but make it specific

Simon Sinek's Start With Why is good but incomplete. Your why can't just be ""I want to be successful"" or ""I want to help people."" That's too abstract for your brain to grab onto.

Get specific and emotional. Not ""I want to be financially stable,"" but ""I want my kids to never worry about money the way I did."" Not ""I want to get fit,"" but ""I want to hike that trail with my best friend without feeling like I'm dying.""

Your brain needs concrete imagery and emotional weight to sustain long term effort.

# Manage energy, not time

You have maybe 4 hours of deep focus capacity per day. Maybe. Cal Newport's Deep Work breaks this down (he's a Georgetown CS professor, the book is dense but incredibly practical). Stop pretending you can grind 12 hour days productively.

Schedule your hardest cognitive work during your peak hours. For most people that's morning. Protect that time viciously. Everything else is maintenance work.

For anyone wanting to go deeper on these concepts without adding another book to your reading list, there's an AI-powered app called BeFreed that pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books on behavioral psychology and achievement science. You type in what you're trying to accomplish, maybe something like ""build better habits"" or ""overcome procrastination,"" and it generates personalized audio content with an adaptive learning plan based on your specific situation.

What's useful is you can customize how deep you want to go, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and context. The voice options are legitimately addictive, I've been using this sarcastic style that makes dense psychology research way easier to digest during my commute. Built by AI researchers from Google and Columbia, so the content quality is solid and science-backed. It's been helpful for turning all these concepts into actual daily progress instead of just theory.

# Stop consuming, start creating

At some point you have to close the books and podcasts and actually do the thing. There's a procrastination trap disguised as productivity where you keep ""researching"" instead of executing.

You don't need more information. You need more implementation. Imperfect action beats perfect planning every single time.

The gap between knowing and doing is where most goals die. You already know enough to start. You're just scared, which is fine, but don't pretend it's about needing one more course or book.

# Get around people doing the thing

Social proof is insanely powerful. If everyone around you is stagnant, you'll stay stagnant. If everyone around you is building something, you'll build something.

This doesn't mean abandon your friends, but actively seek out communities where your goals are normal. Reddit communities, Discord servers, local meetups, whatever. When the behavior you want is normalized, it stops feeling impossible.

Achievement isn't about some mystical discipline or motivation. It's about designing systems that make the right choices easier than the wrong ones. It's about understanding your psychology instead of fighting it.

You're capable of way more than you think. But capability without structure just becomes anxiety and spinning wheels. Build the structure first, the results follow.",2,1769580635.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False
1qp3e3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1qp3e3h/tifu_by_confidently_waving_back_at_someone_who/,TIFU by confidently waving back at someone who definitely wasn’t waving at me,"This happened today and I’m still cringing.

I was walking down the street on my way to grab coffee. It was a decent day, headphones in, minding my own business. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed someone across the road looking straight at me and smiling.

Then they waved.

Without thinking, I waved back. Big, confident wave. Full eye contact. Friendly nod included.

They did not stop waving.

That’s when I realized the wave wasn’t for me.

It was for the person directly behind me.

I slowly turned around and saw a guy walking a few steps back, also waving, clearly recognizing them. They started laughing and talking like old friends.

Meanwhile, I was just standing there, arm still halfway up, looking like I had just interrupted a reunion.

I tried to play it off by pretending I was stretching. Which made it worse. Because who stretches like that while making eye contact with strangers?

The person across the street looked confused for a second, then amused. The guy behind me looked at me like I’d just stolen his moment.

I put my headphones back on, walked away faster than necessary, and decided coffee was no longer worth the emotional damage.

TL;DR: Thought someone was waving at me, confidently waved back, realized I wasn’t part of the interaction, and unlocked a new core memory of embarrassment.",6,1769580594.0,tifu,3,1.0,False

“The Rejection”

POV Amelia

I’m busy scrubbing the pots and pans when the head cook barks at me, “Amelia, the Alpha wants to see you.”

I walk slowly to his office, wondering if Alpha Sebastian has finally decided between me, his mate, or his chosen mate, Celest, to be his Luna.

“Amelia, please have a seat,” he says.

“Hi, Sebastian,” I whimper.

“You will now address me only as your Alpha,” he says coldly.

‘Asshole,’ my wolf Athena says.

“He doesn’t have a choice. His father is forcing him to marry Celest,” I tell my wolf.

“As you know, Celest and I are getting married next week. She is refusing to come here until I reject you.”

I put my head down, close my eyes, and prepare myself.

He inhales deeply. “I, Sebastian Collins, of the Dark Moon Pack, reject you, Amelia Song, of the Dark Moon Pack.”

Tears stream down my face as I wait for the pain.

“You need to accept my rejection,” he barks.

“I don’t want to,” I sob.

“I don’t care what you want; I can’t marry Celest until you do,” he snarls.

“I, Amelia Song, reject you, Sebastian Collins, as my mate.”

I wait for the pain, but nothing comes. Sebastian’s body trembles, and he passes out.

His beta, Chance, comes in, and the guards take Sebastian to the hospital.

Chance looks at me oddly and sits in Sebastian’s chair.

“The Dark Howlers pack has contacted us and requested you be sent to them.”

“I’m not a virgin. Only virgin girls can be tributes. Obsidian Knox will kill me,” I plead.

“Your sexual status is not my problem. You are no longer the mate of my Alpha. Pack your things. You will be picked up in an hour,” he says.

He opens the door and gestures for me to leave.

‘I will kill his Luna on my next hunt,’ Athena declares.

I sob as I pack my bags to leave.

I step outside and try to calm myself. Taking a deep breath, I slide down the brick wall and sit in the grass.

“I hate my life!” I yell to no one while tears fall down my cheeks. 

I rip out the grass blade by blade to try to make myself feel better.

I see a large SUV coming toward me in the distance, and I decide to ignore it.

When the SUV pulls up, a large, monstrous, attractive man steps out.

I don’t look up; I just continue ripping out the grass.

He picks me up, puts me in the back seat, and loads up my bags in the car.

‘I like him,’ Athena purrs.

I sit as far away from him as possible.

“Your father promised you as a breeder to my Alpha when you turned 19,” he says, playing with my curls and letting them spring back.

My eyes widen. 

I had no idea I was promised to Obsidian. 

Why would my father be so cruel?

Obsidian is the Alpha every pack fears.

He’s known for slaughtering entire packs over the smallest offenses.

Every few months, desperate packs send tributes to his territory to appease him.

“I’m Kaden, Obsidian’s Beta. I’ve been sent to assure you’re safely delivered.”

“Oh,” is all I manage to get out.

“Why were you not sent on your nineteenth birthday? Why are you covered in rune markings?” he says, delicately lifting my arms and looking me over.

I remain silent for the rest of the drive.

Kaden doesn’t push me for answers.



The vehicle pulls up to a large castle. The minute I step out, Kaden pulls me inside, and my brain feels like it’s going to melt down.

‘We’re not going to die. At most, he’ll send us to the dungeon, and we’ll escape tomorrow,’ Athena explains, calm as a cucumber.

Kaden takes me into a large office, gives me a bottle of water, and shuts the door.

I gulp the water down like it’s my last drink on earth.

The door swings open. A tall, dangerously handsome man with icy blue eyes and chin length black hair steps inside, his face void of emotion.

He sits in the chair in front of me and pulls me closer so our knees are touching.

“I’m going to ask you a few questions, and if you answer honestly, I will let you live. If you lie, then I will kill you instantly,” he warns.

“Did you know you were promised to me by your father?”

I shake my head. “My parents are dead,” I whisper.

His eyes widen. “Are you a virgin?”

I feel the air shift in the room. 

I hesitate, then shake my head. Obsidian loses it, trashing the office as I sit frozen in the chair.

He storms out of the room, and Kaden comes in and takes his place.

“How many men have you been with?” Kaden asks.

I hold up one finger.

“You’ve been with one person?” he says.

I nod.

“Who is this person?” Kaden asks.

I look down and don’t answer. I couldn’t bear it if someone hurt Sebastian.

“Do you want to die?” Kaden asks.

I shake my head.

“Then tell me who you slept with,” Kaden snarls.



Chapter 2

“The Cursed”

POV Amelia

Obsidian steps back into the office.

“The man you slept with. Do you love him?”

I nod slowly.

“Does he love you?” he asks.

I shake my head.

“Put her in the dungeon until I decide what to do with her,” Obsidian growls.

I stand up, and Kaden gently guides me out.

“Wait,” Obsidian says. “What do the runes drawn all over your skin mean?”

“The healers draw them on to protect the pack from my cursed wolf.”

He looks at me, perplexed, but doesn’t push further.

“Can you shift?” he asks.

“Sometimes, but not right now,” I say.

Kaden takes me to a cell in the dungeon and leaves.

I curl up on the cot.

I am not as weak as I appear. The healers have carved painful runes into my skin since I was a child to suppress my wolf. 

But the Blood Moon gives my cursed wolf enough power to shift and seek revenge on all who have hurt her, in her past lives and in the present.

Tomorrow is the Blood Moon.



I wake up to Obsidian shoving a drink down my throat.

“Drink it all,” he orders.

It tastes like blood and wine. 

I fight my stomach, trying not to bring it back up.

I feel the bond break from my old pack. An intense pain shoots through me, and I scream.

“You feel no pain,” Obsidian whispers, and the pain vanishes.

I feel the new bond to the Obsidian pack snap in place.

‘We officially belong to him now,’ Athena sings.

“Why is that such a good thing? He can still kill us,” I say to her.

Obsidian strokes my hair until I fall asleep.

I wake up in a locked room with open bay windows, and I’m six stories up.

I pour a bath with rose and lavender and melt into it.

“Amelia,” Kaden says, walking into the bathroom. 

I hide my body from him.

“You need not fear me. My job is to protect you. Tonight is the blood moon, when the demon wolf is on the hunt. No one is safe,” he says. “She has never been spotted in our pack, but Obsidian wants you safe just in case.”

I try not to laugh. It is my wolf that he is speaking of. I dare not tell him, or I’ll get thrown out of his pack.

“Holy fuck, is there not a part of you that’s not covered in runes?” he asks.

“It’s to protect you,” I smirk

“You’re such a tiny thing. I doubt your wolf could do much damage,” he chuckles.

“Can I get a little privacy, please?” I ask.

“Yes, of course, little wolf.” He smiles. “Rest assured, our pack is demon wolf proof. She will never get inside our fortress or anywhere near you.”

“There is nowhere she can sneak in?” I ask, for Athena.

“The backwoods, but they are haunted by witches. They would capture her and have her do their bidding,” he explains. “There is enough food on the nightstand to last the night. I’ll check on you in the morning.” 

The moment he’s gone, I wrap myself in a towel, climb into bed, and wait.

There is no point in dressing. The clothes would be destroyed when I shift.

The minute the sun goes down, I feel the raw power of the Blood Moon and fall into darkness.



I wake up the following morning on the bare floor, covered in blood.

My body is sore from head to toe from the rare shift and the damage did fighting all night, and I can barely move. 

I crawl to the shower, turn the water on as hot as possible, and let my sore muscles melt from the heat.

I scrub myself from head to toe until the evidence of last night is gone.

Athena is deep asleep.

I crawl back to my bed, wiping the blood off the floor with my hair towel and chuck it under the bed.

The moment I slide into the silk sheets, the door swings open, and an excited Kaden comes in.

He takes one look at me and looks concerned.

“Should I get the healer?” He asks.

Do I look exhausted?

“No healers. They only fear my wolf and cover me with more runes.”

“There’s no place to draw more runes,” he chuckles.

“They will find room. The process is painful. I just want them gone, but that takes time and no healers.”

“I understand. I just wanted you to know the demon wolf strolled through our village last night and out the gate and didn’t harm anyone here,” Kaden says.

“Oh, wow, really?”

I play along.

“Yeah, I guess the warriors were frozen in shock, and one of them just opened the gate and let her leave.”

“I’m glad no one was hurt,” I say.

“Some of the villagers saw her jump the wall this morning and disappear into the pack, which means she’s from our pack.” He grins from ear to ear.

“Does that mean you will seek her out and kill her?” I ask.

“No, we’re the most feared pack. Obsidian wants to find her and make her his wife,” Kaden chuckles.

I suddenly feel jealous of myself. Or perhaps he knows who I am and wants me to tell the truth so he can kill me?

“What packs did she attack?” I ask.

“Oh, I’m not sure if you want to hear this, but she killed half your pack members, including the Luna, then burned down most of the pack. It sounds like you left at the right time,” he says.

I hide the smile on my face with the blanket.

“That’s terrible news. I hope the Alpha and my family are okay.”

“The Alpha? Why would you care if the Alpha lived or died?” Kaden asks suspiciously.

“Um, well, without him, the pack would fall into chaos,” I say, hoping my feelings for him don’t show on my face.

“I will inquire about your family,” he says, leaving.

The moment he’s gone, I pass out from exhaustion and wake up to a healer and Obsidian in my room.

I dive away from the healer. “Don’t touch me,” I growl.

“You’ve been asleep since yesterday morning,” Obsidian says, concerned.

“Your runes are fading; you need more,” the healer says.

“I don’t want your runes! Stay away from me,” I hiss.

Obsidian looks between me and the healer. “She said no runes. If I find out you put more on her body, I will kill you myself,” he barks, and the healer runs out of the room.

“I’m here to tell you the demon wolf didn’t hurt anyone in your family, and the Alpha was injured trying to save the Luna, but he is fine. He enquired about you returning, and I said no,” Obsidian says.

My heart stops. He wants me back?

“If I find out it was the Alpha that took your virginity, I will kill him,” Obsidian growls, walking out of the room.

‘You’re so easy to read. Your feelings for Alpha Sebastian are written all over your face,’ Athena says.

“I hope he doesn’t hurt him.”

‘As long as he’s not stupid enough to show up here looking for you,’ Athena warns.

I crawl out of bed feeling stiff again.

I have a hot shower, and the minute I step back in the room, two healers are waiting for me. The door is locked and there is no escape.



Chapter 3

“The healers”

POV Amelia

I panic and lock myself in the bathroom, but they find a way in.

I crawl out the tiny bathroom window, and onto the ledge, completely naked, and try to follow the small ledge to the window in the next room.

The healer peers out the window, and one of them tries to follow me. 

A piece of the ledge gives way, and I almost tumble six stories. 

My body starts to tremble uncontrollably in fear, and I continue along, but I’m not able to open the next window.

The healer is closing in, and I’m about to keep moving along the ledge when I hear a scream.

The window suddenly opens behind me, someone yanks me in, and I scream at the top of my lungs. “Please don’t hurt me!”

It’s Kaden. He looks at me bewildered and steps out onto the ledge and tosses the healer off the ledge.

He grabs a sheet off the bed and wraps it around me. Giving me a tight squeeze.

“You’re safe, Amelia. I don’t understand why these healers are obsessed with you, that they would risk their death,” Kaden says.

“I told you. They think my wolf is dangerous.”

“You’re being moved to the mistress’s floor. It’s a heavily guarded floor.”

“I thought I was going to be Obsidian’s breeder.”

“You were, but you are no longer pure, so he’s decided you will become a mistress instead,” he says.

He leads me to my new room. As I walk through the mistress’s floor, I notice all the girls have dark hair and green eyes. I am the only girl with white hair.

“Does Obsidian have a preference for women?” I ask.

“The rumour mill is he prefers only girls with green eyes and dark hair, so the packs always send them to Obsidian as gifts.”

“Should I dye my hair black?”

“No, Amelia. You’re the most beautiful girl here. Don’t change a thing. If you have issues with jealousy, you inform me right away,” he demands.

“Okay,” I say.

My room is gorgeous, with wood floors, a massive bed, and expensive furnishings.

“This is your room now,” he says, leaving.

The door is metal and enforced. The windows all open and will make it easy for Athena to escape unseen during the blood moons.

Every time I step foot outside my room, the girls swarm me and call me ugly until I start to get a complex.

For weeks I wait, and he never comes to see me.

My favorite time in the morning is when Obsidian is done with his girls, and has a fresh shower, and walks by.

His scent is sweet musk and pine, and makes me feel like I’m standing in the middle of a forest.

I noticed him come out of Enya’s room naked, his body glistening, his torso sculpted like a Greek god. 

My mouth drools as I watch a wall of muscle walk down the hall without a care in the world. 

When our eyes meet, he scowls.

I duck back into my room

He swings open my door.

“Why are you sitting on the floor eating?” he growls.

“I needed some fresh air,” I smile.

“Then open a fucking window.”

“That’s not the fresh air I was referring to,” I say, taking him all in.

I was thinking of his musk and pine scent.

His lips turn into a slight smile.

“Do you think I’m ugly?” I ask. “The other girls think I’m ugly to you, and that’s why you never come to see me.”

“My mother picked you out for me when you were young, shortly before she died. I’m just disappointed to find out you were deflowered,” he says.

“Great, ugly and disappointing,” I pout.

“You are important to me, Amelia. I just need time, and I can’t promise I won’t kill him,” he says, leaning down and kissing my cheek.

My heart flutters, and he gives me a tight squeeze and leaves.

The longer I go without seeing the healers, the more the runes fade and the stronger Athena gets.

I’m pouring myself a glass of milk one morning, and one of the girls bumps into me. My glass shatters on the floor.

I bend down to clean it up, and the girl kicks me in the ass. I fall on the broken glass, face first, the glass cutting up my arms and face, and Athena loses it.

She dives on top of her, beating her until she’s unconscious. Obsidian walks in and finds me on top of her.

He pulls me off her and sees the glass stuck in me and loses it.

“I’m calling a healer,” he growls.

“No, no, please don’t.” I start ripping out the glass myself. 

“Stop that immediately,” he growls. “You’re going to scar your face.”

“Only if you promise not to send me a healer,” I plead.

He picks me up and carries me down the hall into a medical room and locks the door. 

Obsidian gives me a shot for pain and takes his time slowly pulling out the glass.

“Tell me exactly what happened and don’t lie,” he orders.

I give him the details of what happened, and his jaw clenches and his eyes narrow.

There’s a knock on the door, and I panic.

“It’s my Beta,” he says.

Kaden comes in and takes over, and Obsidian storms out.

I was enjoying our time together. I hope he’s not mad.

“He’s not mad at you,” Kaden says, like he’s reading my mind. “He’s angry one of the girls hurt you.”

“Then why did he leave?” I ask.

“He wants to take care of it personally to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Kaden explains.

“He doesn’t even give me the time of day. I don’t think he really cares,” I mutter.

“Alpha Sebastian won’t stop calling to speak to you. Every time he calls, Obsidian loses it. You need to talk to Sebastian before he kills him.”

“How? I have no phone in my room.”

“Amelia, you have the run of the castle. We placed you here for your safety.”

“You said I was Obsidian mistress. Why would I have access to the whole castle?”

“Just accept that you do. Call your old Alpha as soon as we’re done.”

“When I’m done and my cuts are all dressed, Kaden takes me to the closest phone.”

“Alpha?”

“Amelia?”

“Yes.” I light up.

“Please come home to me,” he pleads.

“Obsidian knows you took my virginity. If you call again, he’s going to kill you. I was apparently promised to him when I was a child by my father,” I explain.

“You told him? I warned you not to tell anyone. You dumb bitch. I should never have touched you.” He slams down the phone.

‘Let me get out my pen, yup, he’s added to the list,’ Athena says.

“Don’t you dare hurt him,” I hiss at her.

‘Fine, I’ll put him on the maybe kill list. You shouldn’t allow a man you love to treat us that way,’ Athena grumbles.

I open the door, and Kaden is standing there.

“Did you listen in on my whole personal conversation?” I pretend to be angry and stomp off.

“Yes,” Kaden growls.

I head back to our kitchen to eat.

I sit down and pour myself a coffee and order lunch.

“Looks like Enya made an improvement on your ugly face,” Ella hisses.

“Fuck off,” I bark.

She suddenly backs off. “Your eyes are red! Only possessed souls and demons have red eyes.”

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Some things about me:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- I’m a pilot (private pilot, going for my instrument rating), future airline pilot

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about random niche topics

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- FC Barcelona fan and yes I have opinions

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- Computer science at UMD

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- I’m really ambiverted quiet at first, then I’ll yap about literally anything

In a relationship I value honesty, commitment, and loyalty. If you’re looking for something real and you want to build, we’ll probably click.

Looking for 18-22 only, from the US, Canada or the UK. 

If you message me, tell me:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- your hottest hot take (political, goofy, whatever)

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- a show/game you’ve been into lately

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- what you want most in a relationship

Snow shoveling dude.,"Wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone who reached out for snow shoveling. My brother, friend and his GF, and I were out freeing up driveways and cars from 4:30PM-12:15AM. We unfortunately couldn’t make it to about 3 people today, likely because they fell asleep; I promise we didn’t forget you, we just got overwhelmed with the service load. On the bright side, we will get to you guys tomorrow and are on the top of our list if you’re still interested.

I want to say thank you again. The money was amazing, but we do feel happy we were able to free people up who need their cars to get to work and to use for whatever needs they have. A few cases told us that they had to pay almost $80+ in uber to get to work, so that made us happy to know that stress was now gone. We freed up some elderly people, people who physically can’t do the work for a wide range of reasons, and others who simply don’t have the tools.  My friends and I are fortunate to have to tools and physical health to get the work done, and we are simply blessed in that way.

If anyone cares to know, the money I made is going to pay for both my young daughter’s soccer programs for the upcoming spring. So I feel blessed to have the opportunity come my way, that honestly only happened because of one super cool Canadian dude who needed our help. The story is funny, I was bored in the office having a coffee break, saw the Reddit post and jumped at the opportunity.

1qp36ej,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp36ej,This is my life now huh.,"Got diagnosed on the Dec 31 2026
I got an A1C of 12.something.
I'm gonna go one a long run on sentence about the start of my journey. 

Tl:DR is I'm diabetic now, trying to live a healthier life. Ketones and DKA scares the fuck out of me. I'm on Metformin and Jardiance

I didn't know this would come with depression. I do get my spouts of sadness but its not as bad as the first week. I went through the whole ""being dead might be better than this"" but I got over that by thinking of all the people who live with this and how it is possible.

Do I ever get to feel normal again?
You the how the highs and the lows feel.
There are sport moments where I do feel normal even good. So I chase those movements but when I get the highs or lows it kinda hits me all over again the fact that this will always be life.

Ketones and DKA Scare me
I keep hearing how this will kill you. That's my biggest fear rn. Then they symptoms all feel like common things
So when I feel one I think ""oh this is this it!?"" I know you can test for it but is it gonna be like the BG prick where Im doing 3 to 5 times a day.

Sleeping is something a hit or miss.
I worry about sleep more now. Sometimes when I lay down my heart races and I fell so anxious. Can I even stay up late now? In bed by 10 up at 5.

Metformin and Jardiance
Thank you good rx for the discount. 380$ to 280$ seems more manageable.
Jardiance in the morning and Metformin an hour or two before bed.

Meals every two hours
Eating every two hours seems to work for me. Something very small in the morning. I go big meal, little meal, big meal, then little meal. Then so on every two hours chicken and broccoli seems to be my go to. I don't miss the old foods or the sweets. I can eat chicken for the rest of my life and would be happy. Fiber I'm getting that from the broccoli and celery. I do eat all wheat bread but IDK if I could should cut that. It's Dave's killer bread. The whole wheat one. Started eating black berries and almonds as a side. Not too much tho just a five berries a day and a about 10 almonds. Idk if I should cut the bread I eat about two or three turkey and provolone cheese sandwiches a day.

Working is a fun.
I did the whole walking thing and yes I can help but I feel like the calf raises help alot more. Got a dumbbell and started working on my arms. I work out after every meal for about 10 to 15 minutes. Muscles can help with with blood sugar management. So I gotta put them it on. I work at a home improvement store. It's the one you're thing thinking about. If you're American then you know.
So I find myself doing more work just to get the work out.

I'm getting religious I guess
I'm not big on the religion thing but you know how it goes. In the dark times you turn to something. I'm not gonna convince you that's what you should do. I prayed for the first time in my life what it's feels like. I didn't pray to be magically cured but for strength. The strength to take live my life with this condition.
Hearing the Bible on the audiobook too. First time, gotta see what the hype is about you know.

Hydration, no smart ass type title
Wife got me a water bottle. So I only drink water. Nothing else. I tried black coffee and my sugar went to 330. Water for the rest of my life. I'm digging it

Healthy living. Its like doible dipping
Not only am I living healthy but it's helping with my diabetes. So it's like double dipping. Plus It's kinda helping to mood. Only a month in so not much results but I feel it. I spent 29 years living like shit. So the rest being healthy is a fine by me.

My mindset
""In moderation"" when I Google if a type 2 diabetic can have something and I see those two words I just take it as no. In the future maybe but right now no. They really scares the shit out of me when they diagnosed me with that could happen to me so I'm on a stric diet and I will not stray. I have that going on so i think it's good.

Fears
Beside DKA I'm also scared of going out. Cause I feel ill get high or low sugar. But I'm trying to carry emergency small meal. I plan meals to avoid being caught with lows. Lows are scary. 

Patience and time
When I do I feel any highs or low I just want them to go away right away but I learning you have to give it a big of time. And not to wait too long to address them. Timing is tricky for me. Sometimes I try and mess with how long I can go before eating or dealing with the signs of a high or low. Only to be reminded I do not have wiggle room for that. Wonder if that will ever change for the better.

How I see other diabetics
I understand now shitty this all feels and now I'm very sympathetic about it. I hate myself for waiting till I have this condition to being sympathetic about it. But if it's type 1 or 2 even 3 (3 is the pregnancy one I think) I see you and understand. Hell even the prediabetics are included.

The depression sucks
At the start I isolated myself from everyone expect my wife. Not cause I was embarrassed or felt someone shame but because I want to really give myself time to accept what I was diagnosed with. I might have spend a little too much time doing that and I think that only added on to the depression. So being here around people who know the struggle is already helping.

Lifestyle change ain't too bad
It's cringe to say it but I am a gamer
So I don't spend much time being active
So now I squeeze in those little work outs in between games

I'm sure there's other things I wanted to say but that's all I got. If you read this all I appreciate it. If not then I don't blame you. Any tips or constructive criticism is welcomed. 
I'll add pics from my first week of testing my blood sugar to the latest week and the then average of my overall time which is like a month.

Day 1 - Smooth, got my work done without any distractions. It worked! Had slight headache for rest of day but was ok.

Day 2 - Again smooth while on it, got my work done. Coming off it around 5 hours after I felt a bit low and flat with slight anxiety.

Day 3 (today) - Around 1 hour after taking I have a mini panic attack because I just feel a lot of anxiety. I feel like hyper aware of my surroundings and feel like my friend is looking at me when he’s not. I was getting overwhelmed so downed some orange juice as heard it can lessen the effects and calmed down.

I’ve got no history of other mental health issues, I had the same sort of experience feeling panicky and trapped in a bad way about 15 months ago when I smoked weed (probably way too much) - but haven’t smoked since and only smoked a handful of times in total.

Also no other known mental health issues in my family. I suspect I may have a tiny bit of OCD but nothing that bothers me day to day.

Quite upset with my experience as after the first day I was happy it helped me finally get stuff done! I’m thinking of taking half a tablet (2.5mg) tomorrow and seeing if a lesser dose is what I need? Though 5mg already seems pretty low and I’m an 80kg 6”4 male.

I’ve had a really good experience with caffeinated (80mg dose) green tea matcha drinks instead of coffee to help my ADHD for a couple hours. With dexamfetamine like focus and 0 side effects.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

I’m a 22F living in Sydney however I live quite far west in one of the dodgiest and most low socioeconomic suburbs. The problem is, I’m 110% on my own in the sense of no one is going to be helping me with anything at all. I have some great friends but it doesn’t go much further than hanging out every few weeks. I’m truly struggling financially despite working full time being paid above award. And I’m as smart with my money as I feel I can be. But I’m barely surviving. I don’t ever spend money on anything not essential so no silly purchases like clothes, not even any treats like a coffee or some chocolate. I strictly only spend my money on rent, fuel, bills, groceries and medical expenses. But I will have usually $15 left after paying those things if I’m lucky, maybe up to $50 if I did more overtime than usual. And I already do all the things they tell you to save money, lights are off, ac and heaters never get used, nothing goes in the dryer unless I’m in dire straits. My groceries - I’m unwillingly vegetarian because I can’t afford to buy any meats, I also don’t buy dairy because I can’t afford that either. My grocery shopping each week consists of fruit, veg and rice and pasta. I only cook my own food, never buy out or order in, not even on lunch breaks at work, I take packed lunches every day. I use the fuel check app to find the cheapest fuel possible each week. I don’t pay for any streaming services or other subscriptions. I do pay for Spotify because music is my lifeline and that’s I think $14 a month or somewhere around that. I’m already living in the cheapest part of Sydney and my place is below market value, if I search for rentals now I can’t find a single one for the same price as what I’m paying and certainly can’t find one cheaper. I’m just at a loss and it feels impossible. I’m currently looking for weekend and evening work but with no weekday availability it’s hard to find anywhere willing to hire. I’m looking to work 15+ hr a day 7 days a week because based on the maths that’s the only way I will be able to survive. What in the world am I meant to do??? I don’t have anyone I can share expenses with, my friends all either live with their parents or with a partner. And neither of those are options for me, I can’t live with my parents and I did have a partner but he almost killed me so I’m never doing that again.

She has been going out every weekend and hanging out with lots of different guys. Which like you do you girl you know who cares however, during that time she has pretty much not really been involved with our friend group at least me & 1 other person, I have talked to her maybe twice since before Christmas. 

Anyways one of our friends texted our groupchat that his mom was in the hospital and I replied that my grandma was there too maybe they’d be roommates or neighbors or something, and what made me upset is that she never texted and asked about her. She has since passed away. It makes me upset that none of them asked about her except the one who’s mom was in the hospital but it feels a lot more elevated when I think about her because she has been fairly close with my family in the past.

She’s gone to the beach with us for the past 2 years, she came to thanksgiving last year, while we were at the beach she would drink coffee with my mom and talk to her every morning. It was my mom’s mom that passed away. Maybe worth mentioning she had slid up on one of my Snapchat stories about me skiing and I left it on opened, which caused her to ask our other friend if I’m mad at her or if anything is going on. That was the first time she had reached out to me probably in about a month.

Chapter 1 The Unknown Future Gamma



Zalia

My name is Zalia, I am a twenty-six-year-old Lycan and the future Gamma of the Moon Stone Pack. Our Pack is the largest Pack after Mystic Moon Pack, the King’s Pack.

Also, our Pack is one of the few Packs in our Kingdom that is a mix of Werewolves and Lycans, with my family being one of the Lycan families that live in our Pack.

Our current leadership each has a male and female Pup, but unlike what everyone seems to think, our future leadership will have two males and one female. Because I am the first born Pup of our Pack’s Gamma, it means that I will be taking over from my Father when they step down, something I have been training for since I turned fifteen.

As the future Gamma, I am smart enough to know how to take every precaution to counter any attack. Our Alpha has seen it happen over and over again during our training, that I have been putting the future Alpha and Beta on their asses more than once and I can see that our Alpha always had to hide his laughter at the embarrassment his Son faced.

Luckily every Pup in his Pack was raised the same way, and no one got angry when they got their asses kicked by me. No one ever treated me differently because I am a female; they always listened if I pointed out where they made a mistake and most of our Warriors have grown because of it.

I am very contented with my position and my Pack. The only thing that annoys me is the Pack Visits we have to conduct every now and then: I need to tag along but no one in other Packs even realize that I am my Pack’s future Gamma.

When we arrive at Sundown Pack, the Alpha and Luna are looking down on me, and they act as if I am the help.

This has been going on for a few years now and each time it gets more difficult to bite my tongue during Pack visits, but Alpha Brad had been very clear in his warning towards me: I am not allowed to harm anyone, just because I am better trained than most Pups I meet.

“You, get me some coffee.” Layla, Alpha Mike’s Daughter, is pointing me.

“Why don’t you get off your lazy ass and do it yourself?” I growls at her. Donovan, our future Alpha, and Gibson, our future Beta, start laughing their asses off. I doubt anyone has ever spoken to her like that and the dumbfounded look on her face is priceless.

Her high-pitched cry for her Daddy has me rolling down the aisles with Twilight, my Lycan. She is a fucking adult and she should be able to fend for herself.

Donovan stops laughing the moment Alpha Mike steps into the room, but there is no way in hell I can stop laughing and I don’t even try to hide it.

Alpha Brad tries to talk to Alpha Mike in a normal fashion, but Alpha Mike is demanding an apology from us for making his Daughter cry, and we just stare at him in surprise. Donovan actually does apologize to her, but I flat out refuse to do it and Alpha Brad knows better than to try and force me.

Alpha Mike is unaware of my temper and gets into my face, yelling at me to apologize to his Daughter.

“Why the fuck would I apologize to her? She acts like a spoiled six-year-old, maybe you should have raised her better.” I yell back at him and my Lycan Twilight nearly takes over control when he raises his hand. He is lucky that Alpha Brad steps between the two of us.

I would have kicked Alpha Mike’s ass if he had tried to hit me. Alpha Brad is very aware of the fact that I would have been able to take him down.

This is why I hate Pack visits so much. Some act like everyone owes them something and as if they're so much better than the rest of us. On top of that there is the way they talk to anyone who isn't of an Alpha bloodline. Would it hurt them to treat someone with some respect?

Other than that accident, some even thought I was there because I was Alpha Brad’s mistress, and some thought I was sleeping with Donovan or Gibson. None of them even thought I was there because I am Donovan’s Gamma.

I was surprised when Donovan didn’t correct them, but I blamed it on their Daughter who was ogling Donovan and her relentless attempts to get him to go with her.

I am grateful that Alpha Brad instilled a great respect for the Mate-bond in all of us at an early age: you don’t sleep with everyone that is willing and you certainly don’t sleep with someone from your own Pack.

I never slept with a male, even though many have offered but I shot each and every one of them down and I might have punched a handful of them for not taking a hint.

If Donovan or Gibson get agitated with females who can’t take No for an answer, they go for a run or spar at the training grounds of the Pack we visit.

I can’t do that because no one knows that I am the future Gamma of Moon Stone Pack and that means that they don’t allow me to train with the members of the Packs we visit. I don’t have an outlet for my frustrations during a visit.

I always envy them because I can’t even go for a run without a Luna or Alpha talking down to me. No one questions Donovan and Gibson when they take off for a run or some training.

That's why I chose to keep to myself during the visit—it causes trouble if I interact too much with those bimbos and assholes.

Aside from my run-in with Alpha Mike, I stayed quiet the entire time, and he nearly paid the price for all the crap I heard during the visit.

Another thing I hate about these visits is the fact that everyone tells me to eat less. I need the food to keep up my stamina and I need a lot of stamina for the patrols I run every day. I am a Lycan, it isn’t as if I will become fat and even if some of it sticks to my bones I don’t care.

Every Luna would tell me that I needed to watch what I was eating, that my Mate wouldn’t appreciate a Mate that ate so much, and that my Mate wouldn’t like a Mate with a size more.

Damn, a size more. I have a size six and damn proud of it, I don’t need to look like a stick.

Most of the Lunas are so thin I fear they would be blown away during a storm and still they complain about being overweight.

During this visit though it was almost every female that made remarks about my food consumption and from the corner of my eye, I had seen Donovan and Gibson laughing, but I thought they were just commenting on the females through their mind-link.

I am just glad that this visit is over, but unfortunately we have to attend to another grand meeting next: a meeting between the Alphas of all the Packs in the Kingdom and the Alpha King.

For over a decade I have been forced to come to this meeting. I didn’t have a choice though, our King demands that the future leadership of a Pack start attending after the future Alpha turns sixteen.

“Calm down, Zalia. You have two months of peace and quiet.” Donovan says teasingly.

“Okay, was it necessary to remind me of that? As if I am looking forward to spending four days with them and no way to get out of it or to get rid of the frustration by running border patrol.” I growl.



Chapter 2 The All Alphas Meeting



Zalia

The day is finally here, note the sarcasm. The annual All Alphas Meeting has arrived and I have been training or running border patrol most of the time. Anything to keep my mind off the next four days.

We were taught that we needed to come to this meeting to learn how to get along with other Packs, but I think most Alphas use it to find a suitable Mate with a high rank for the future leadership of their Pack.

Because every Pup of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma that is fifteen or older tags along, just to make sure they get noticed by other Packs, and maybe a male or female takes an interest.

For our Pack it means that right now, our Alpha and his two Pups, Donovan and his baby sister Elinor are present, our Beta’s two Pups, Gibson and his baby sister Kali are also here, and then there is me and my baby Brother Slater.

As usual, we are the first Pack to arrive, and a Warrior escorts us to our table in the largest meeting room.

More Alphas walk in right behind them and each of them has the Pups of their leadership with them. The males are dressed properly, but the females… I am not sure how to describe it. Some are wearing a skirt and top, but it looks as if they bought them a size or two too small as it barely covers their ass and breasts.

I wonder why their parents allow them to dress like that, my Father would kick my ass back up the stairs to my room to change.

“What is so funny, Gamma?” Donovan asks through the mind-link and when I tell him my train of thought, Dad nearly chokes on the sip of water he took.

“You’re damn straight I would kick you back up the stairs. I don’t understand their parents either . W hy would they allow their Daughters to degrade themselves like that ? ” Dad growls through the mind-link and we are all laughing as we see another female walk in, wearing a dress that leaves almost all of her skin exposed.

I scrunch my nose as I smell so many males and females covered in the scent of sex and I nearly vomit when a future Gamma sits down at the table behind us.

“Fuck, couldn’t he have showered ? ” Kali shouts over the mind-link as a male sits down behind us, the scent of sex drifting our way and I ask her how he is supposed to do that if it happened only a few minutes ago.

“Can you imagine that you would be able to smell almost all of them covered in a scent of sex? A nd not all of them had sex with their Mate. ” I ask her and every head snaps in my direction.

Our Alpha tells us that he feels sorry for us as we as Lycans, are more affected by it than Werewolves.

“Yeah, right. How often have you asked Dad if someone smelled of sex that wasn’t his Mate?” I ask him.

Dad starts laughing out loud and I know I hit the bullseye with my question. Kali and Elinor giggle as our Alpha turns slightly red.

By the time everyone is seated, my Brother, my Father and I are breathing through our mouths and even the others have trouble breathing normally.

Today is for the King to welcome everyone to the venue and for everyone to mingle before the Pack meetings begin tomorrow, something I really hate to be a part of. Most of these Alphas have outdated ideas about females or twisted ideas about fated Mates and I hate the way they always stare at me or ignore my presence.

We all stand when the Royal Family finally enters the room and I see each of them scrunching their noses. “Looks like they smell it too.” Elinor says and I just nod my head.

I had already seen the barely dressed female saunter over to a table near the stage and I felt sorry for whoever she came for. She sits down next to Mavka, Mother of the future Royal Gamma, and both of them are talking softly as the female’s eyes keep wandering towards the stage.

Whoever she is after doesn’t respond and the scowl on her face becomes worse by the minute and I hope that none of the males in this room are her fated Mate.

I hear Twilight, my Lycan, giggle at my thoughts. “What about females?” She asks and I am so thankful for the training Dad gave me or I would have been rolling down the aisles here.

The Royal Family allows everyone their five minutes of gossip. I never understood the meaning of it and I doubt I ever will. Why would you want to discuss which male could be your Mate?

But then again only the future Royal Gamma is unmated and I actually feel sorry for him. “That is why she is sitting with Mavka.” Twilight states, “She must be after her son.”

Deimos

Four days of dealing with Alphas and Lunas that want to shove their Daughter in my bed, four days of my Mother Mavka trying to help those Alphas and Lunas. I am wishing I could just disappear while Goliath, my Lycan, is growling in my head at the prospect of the next four days and I know he will snap at our Mother eventually.

No matter what either one of us says to her, she keeps bringing females with her and I am glad the King told her she was no longer allowed to bring a guest when she comes over for dinner, but now she tries to force me to come home for dinner. Which I refuse to do and luckily I have my duties as the future Royal Gamma as an excuse.

My parents were chosen Mates and I know Dad regrets that he didn’t wait for his fated Mate. Mother started cheating on him almost immediately and when she was pregnant with me he refused to believe her until Doc could prove that I was his Son. After that he went to see the King and he was allowed to reject her on the grounds of infidelity.

Dad raised me on his own, but Mother stayed in the picture hoping that I would get her back into the Palace.

It was my eighth birthday when I decided I didn’t want her there and she tried to persuade me by telling me that she was my Mother and that she loved me.

“Mother, you don’t love me. You just love the fact that I will be the next Royal Gamma and you want to take advantage of that status. The only time I see you is when you know that a lot of important Wolves and Lycans will be around, hoping you can find another chosen Mate to give you status and to cheat on.”

Even Goliath hates her and her Wolf for putting their own needs before those of their Pup. Yes, even my Mother’s Wolf had been neglecting us, which is rare as a Wolf or Lycan’s instinct will always be to put their Pup first.

Ammon, our future King, pulls me from my thoughts as we walk towards the meeting room and we both stick our noses in the air, “Fuck, this is going to be one hell of a day.” He says as we both smell the scent of sex and I know it will hit us full force the moment we step into the room.

“Why is it necessary for them to screw around just before these meetings?” Asha, Ammon’s Mate, asks over the mind-link and Ammon decides to give her multiple reasons for it to distract her from the smell, unlike us, she has more trouble hiding her disgust with these Wolves and Lycans, and as the future Queen she can’t show those emotions outward.

I keep my eyes on our seats, but as every year, I am surprised to see the females of Moon Stone Pack. They are the only ones that actually dress like leaders, and I smile as I see all three of them doing the same thing I am. “Asha, I see at least a few females know how to behave themselves.” I say with a chuckle.

I nearly lose my shit when I see Mavka, my so-called Mother, at a table near the stage, and besides her is a female dressed in… well, I am not sure what it is supposed to be. If that is meant to turn a male on, then I am probably broken and when I say that through our mind-link, Asha nearly trips up. It is a good thing Ammon always has a good grip on her.



Chapter 3 Food



Deimos

We sit down in our seats as the King motions everyone to quiet down and it takes a few minutes before everyone is quiet, except of course for a few females that think talking about whatever is more important. The King keeps quiet until a few of the Alphas finally realize it is because of the females with them that the King isn’t speaking.

Goliath points out that everyone at the table of Moon Stone Pack has a smirk on their faces and I have to stifle a smile as I look at each of them, “The females are better at hiding what they are looking at than the males.” I say to Goliath and we both chuckle as one of the females shoves her elbow into the side of the future Alpha.

I see the brunette smiling as she looks past us for a second and I wonder what the hell is so damn funny, “Someone is trying to get your attention, Son.” Dad says through the mind-link and I already know what he is talking about, probably also the reason why the brunette is smiling.

The King’s speech is something we all worked on and we tried to get as many words in without actually saying a damn thing, it was good fun making this speech.

Our Queen had made the start of the speech in which he welcomes the Alphas and Lunas for attending and Asha was the one to put in the Pups that were accompanying their parents.

We had laughed our asses off when she tried to find subtle ways to tell them to stop fucking around, but in the end she had managed to find a rather romantic way of putting the message out there.

“Alphas and Lunas, your brought along the Pups of your current leadership and they will be our future.

A future we as the Royal Family have been granted already, we found a Daughter in your future Queen and our Son’s fated Mate. Something we all are longing for, something we are all waiting for and when we find our fated Mate we will become stronger and better.

Prince Ammon and Princess Asha had both been waiting for their fated Mate to step into their lives, and both of them want to express to all of you how grateful they are that they waited for the other to start their life’s journey, to have all the firsts as adults with one another.” He says.

I know he had struggled with that last sentence and he had thrown a few things my way every time I laughed my ass off, he had choked on the words every single time. I hear Ammon laughing in our mind-link as the King looks from Ammon to Asha and we all see the look he gives Asha.

Eryx, the future Royal Beta, and I had taken it upon ourselves to put the meetings into the speech, but like Asha, we struggled to put down a lot of words that meant absolutely nothing and we needed help from the others to get anything on the paper. The King had said it was never easy to say a lot without actually saying anything.

At least we got the chance to practice, because in the future we have to do this for ourselves and it is not something I am looking forward to.

“In the next few days, we all hope to have good and meaningful discussions about a variety of subjects, from training to security and from Balls to meetings.

We all hope that by the time each and every one of you goes home, that it will have been a fruitful event in one way or another and that we all can look back on a successful meeting.” He says as we see a lot of the Wolves and Lycans smile, but Asha points out that the members from Moon Stone Pack look as if they know that the King actually said nothing at all.

“Lunch has been served in the main dining room. I ask you kindly to stay seated until a Warrior comes to your table and he will guide you to your table in the dining room. It will be the table you will be seated at during every meal for the next few days.” He says before we all get up and follow him out of the meeting room.

We get some food from the buffet before we sit down and the Queen nods her head at her assistant, giving the unspoken order to let the others join us for lunch. The first Pack to be seated is Moon Stone Pack and they are at the table closest to ours.

The Alpha and Gamma sit down while the Pups walk over to the buffet and the brunette is joggling three plates with ease. I know everyone is watching her as she fills each plate with food, before she heads back to their table and places a plate in front of the Alpha and the Gamma and both of them thank her with a smile.

Many females look at their table with anger or envy in their eyes, but I know it is an unspoken rule that Moon Stone Pack gets seated near the Royal Family and I know they will not cause any problems with us. They like to keep to themselves just like we do.

Every female that walks to the buffet looks at our table for as long as they can, but none of us respond to it and I can feel their anger growing more and more. I see them walking in their high heels and it doesn’t look very steady to me, but with a plate of food they sway even more on their legs.

I keep my eyes on my plate as I hear Eryx chuckle when a blond nearly loses her balance.

“Who the hell let her walk off without a guard?” Asha snarls through our mind-link and Sila, Eryx’s Mate, asks her why she is so concerned.

“What will happen if that plate of food flies out of her hand and onto another Alpha’s Daughter?” Asha asks.

Zalia

This food is amazing and I can’t wait for everyone to have had their first serving. I need to get to that buffet again. Twilight agrees with me as a blond walks past us swaying on her high heels.

“Why would you wear those if you can’t even walk on them?” I ask over the mind-link and as expected the males call out in unison, “Because they think it is sexy.”

I stare at each of them before I ask over the mind-link, “They really think it is sexy that they look drunk?”

Kali and Elinor burst out in laughter with me. Slater just chuckles as Dad shakes his head and Donovan just stares at me. And as always Gibson thinks my question is sincere and answers that they meant the high heels.

“Okay, you did notice that the Queen is also wearing high heels, but she doesn’t walk around as if she is drunk.” I say as I look at him and he finally realizes I had been pulling their chains.

“Zalia, how did patrol go last night?” our Alpha asks to change the topic we are discussing.

“When I got there at eleven there was nothing to report, but about an hour into my shift, we had two Rogues at our eastern border. When they saw me they thought I was ripe for the picking, but Twilight decided to show them that we don’t back down from anyone and both were dead in a minute or so.

We didn’t have any other problems during the rest of our shift and before we left, I checked in with morning patrol, but between six and eight there had been nothing to report.” I answer him as I ask Kali through the mind-link if the buffet is finally free again.

She tells me that everyone has gotten their plate of food, but before I can get up my Dad growls at me, “Zalia, you are telling me you stayed out on patrol all night, that you haven’t slept at all?” He says and as I get up to head for the buffet I say,

“Just like always, Dad. Why would going to this meeting need to change my routine?

I didn’t ask to be dragged down here. I didn’t ask anyone to make up this stupid rule that the Pups of our leaderships need to be paraded in front of everyone and I sure as hell didn’t ask anyone to force the future leaderships to be present at every damn boring meeting.

Now, if you’ll excuse me or not for that matter, I need some more food before Twilight decides she is going to eat and then it won’t be from a plate.”

I walk away knowing full well that everyone in the dining room heard his question and my answer and I know that is what Dad was going for.

I keep my eyes on the buffet, but I can see a lot of males staring at me and I know I will get a lot of questions during our mingling session after lunch. Yippie, already looking forward to it, Not. At least now all of them will know that I am a Gamma’s Daughter and that means that their attentions will most likely be far from sexual.

“You run border patrol often?” I hear the King’s voice ask as the entire room goes quiet and I turn towards him as I answer him, “Yes, Your Majesty. I run border patrol in the same shift as my team, just because I am the Daughter of our Pack’s Gamma doesn’t mean I have to act like a spoiled little brat.

I can take care of myself as I have been training since I turned seven and I started running border patrol when I was forced to come to these meetings. I told our Alpha if I was old enough to be dragged down here, I sure as hell was old enough to run border patrol.

Just between you and me, Your Majesty. I think running border patrol is a lot safer than coming here.” I make a little bow before I head back to our table and I can hear the King chuckle behind me, everyone at the Royal table is chuckling and giggling.

Deimos

How the hell does she look so good after missing a good night’s sleep? I always feel like crap after running patrol at night and I always need most of the day to sleep it off. Goliath is rolling down the aisles when she answers her Father and I hear Ammon laughing through our mind-link.

“Dad, can we keep her?” He asks and I know exactly why he is asking, she isn’t shy with her opinions.

1qp33jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1qp33jn/where_is_perfection_of_human_life/,where is perfection of human life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1769579667.0,disability,0,1.0,False
1qp32qo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qp32qo,Infamous cars in gran turismo pt2,"Yeah last time I missed a few cars but that was mb on my part but anyways I did but anyway here's more infamous cars from gran turismo. 

First is the Daihatsu Midget II which is a meme kei car. its also the cheapest vehicle in gran turismo history only costing like 3k.

Then we have the daihatsu copen which is another meme car. its infamous for being in the first coffee break in gt4 in the license tests.

Then we have the SLR Mclearn which is infamous for that specific one lap magic mission. Mission 34, Basically you have you catch other Mercedes on the hardest track in gt4 the nurburgring and they get a 2 minute headstart while you have to wait in real time. If you make a mistake you have to wait again for 2 minutes unless your playing gt4 on a emulator as you can just speed it up.

Then we have the motorcarrige wagons which are basically historic joke vehicles.

Then we got the Toyota pod which only appeared in GT Concept. Its basically a Toyota that has AI+ Emotions. Its another meme car that exists.

Next is that infamous GT40 from the historic car cup in gt2 I think. Basically this GT has 10hp over the hp limit which was i think 295hp? But yeah it's a somewhat challenging opponent in that event. 

Then we have that iconic white ford gt from the games intro and cover. The Ford GT LM Spec II Race Car. This special ford gt is a fictional race car based off the 2002 ford gt concept car. But unfortunately in gt7 they changed the car to the final production ford gt instead of the concept version. 

Then we have the Suzuki Escudo pikes peak which is another iconic car as well. Its infamous in gt3 for that out of bounds glitch in Seattle circuit ane also the wheelie glitch as well. It's a very fast car but unfortunately it has really bad drag due to the massive wing it has. In events like like the wind it always gets dead last due to the drag and downforce.

There's also the Nissan Skyline GTR R34 Pace car. Its infamous for being in the license test and you can also drive this car.

Then there's the black impreza which is a fictional car. It became a meme because of a official video of the car driving around trial mountain as it was spinning out, crashing into everything and even cutting to the car flying through the air for seemingly no reason. 

There's also the Nike one 2022. its basically a fictional vehicle made by Nike that appeared in gt4 only. Surprisingly its a prize car in 2 different places. You can get it for getting broze on the B license or from the saleen s7 one make event.

This vehicle also surprisingly has the highest downforce of all the vehicles in gt4. It has even higher downforce than the Toyota GT-One. 

Another infamous car is the Toyota rsc rally raid car which is the best money method in gt4. If you beat rally of Capri on easy you get this car which sells for 265,624k credits. The event is also repeatable so you can keep getting this car over and over and over and keep selling it for money. Even someone got 20 of this things and sold em all. 

And lastly as an honorable mention im giving it to the tommykaira zzII. Specifically in gt5-6 its infamous for being the cheapest supercar in the series only costing 60k credits. Its a very good car tho as it can beat a lot of opponents and even possibly lmp/ group c cars. The car fully maxed out can hit 280mph in gt6.

Another infamous car is the Toyota minolta 88cv race car. It was very good in gt4. 

But yeah that's more infamous/meme gran turismo cars. There might be more cars i missed but if there is let me know in the comments.",1,1769579595.0,TRJSafehouse,0,1.0,False
1qp329k,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1qp329k/just_a_little_cup_of_coffee/,Just a little cup of coffee,"So right now I’m very furious, I had a phone call with my oldest son who just became a teacher in the church and he mentioned many times how he felt uncomfortable being at my home (I left the church 3 years ago and have been divorced and now happily married to another ex Mormon) because I drink coffee in the morning. He said he wasn’t as bothered by it but was concerned about his younger siblings being influenced to think that it isn’t a big deal. At his mom’s house she along with his grandparents on both sides are super mormon, until I left 3 years ago and before the divorce I also was very into the church so I get where he is coming from. 

But where I am really having a hard time with is how the church teaches that one small cup of coffee will keep you out of the temple and break apart your eternal family. Because of this teaching my son, MY OWN SON doesn’t want to come into my home. For your info, I drink one cup of coffee in the morning, the caffeine does nothing for me, doesn’t wake me up or anything, I like the flavor and that it has health benefits in moderation. My wife and I teach our kids/step kids good morals, how to be a decent human being, how to think for yourself and ask questions. But we are the bad guys because we drink something that an organization deems as immoral. 

We live in Idaho Falls, which is super Mormon, large majority of my son’s friends are mormon, basically just living in the bubble so of course all the narrative my son gets is what the church wants to control it’s members with. My fear in stepping out of the church was that my kids would start to distance themselves from me or see me as less of a person and that is starting to come true. I want to throat punch the church and kick it’s patriarchal balls so hard for brainwashing kids and creating distance and driving a wedge between my kids and me and for all the other families that have been destroyed because of it’s teachings. 

What will really send me over the edge is when (I’m positive this day will come sooner than later) the church silently takes away the messages that coffee and tea are against the word of wisdom and can totally be taken in moderation and even have some noted health benefits, while also teaching that they never taught that it was against the WoW and would prevent temple/celestial life.

I know I’m joining the many, many, many people that have been screaming at the church since its founding and I’m so sorry that it took me almost 40 years in the church to recognize how brainwashed I was.

I love my kids so much, they are everything to me, I try and teach them to have an open mind, to not trust blindly, that there is hypocrisy in the church, and to not be afraid to ask questions especially when contrary to what is taught.

I will fully support and love my children in all they do and my hope is that they will know that my love for them will always be there and when the church ultimately fails them I’ll be rushing to them with open arms.",14,1769579553.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

I've ruled out framework because it's expensive and likely will be like my macbook.

I'm looking for something tough and relatively cheap that's powerful enough to open a shitload of tabs or playing shit like counter-strike source and factorio and shit at decent framerates.

I also do light video editing and lowpoly blender work.

Can the t480 handle that workload?

Any upgrades to handle that workload?

Second, there are some bus routes that go to and from the local schools. 

Anyway, I took the bus to a local coffee shop in a part of town that I rarely go to. Using the google directions (they also map out bus trips for you), ended up taking a route that would have me stop at a corner about a mile down the street from where I was trying to go. From point A, I had to get at the transit hub to catch a second bus (this is the bus that drops me off a mile away from the coffee shop). On my way back, I noticed another bus stop that I didn't see before. I figured that it should at least get me back to the transit hub. And being that all the bus stops looked the same, I had no idea of the route number or where it was going. When the bus got to the stop, I was about to get on when the driver started yelling at me, telling me that the bus picked up students from the one of the local schools. 

\#1, I wouldn't know that, because there's no sign that tells me so. #2, if it's a public transit bus, you'd think that they would pick up other passengers as well. So, I ended up filing a complaint with the transit company about the driver's behavior. When I spoke to the supervisor, he did tell me that, even though the bus goes to the school, they can also pick up other riders along the route. AITA for filing the complaint?

1qp2vwd,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/culture/film-and-tv/film/article-as-a-well-known-transgender-person-in-the-united-states-my-life-is/,Trans actor Scott Turner Schofield shares why he left the U.S. and what inspired new film,"“As an award-winning actor, activist and Hollywood consultant, Scott Turner Schofield never planned to leave Los Angeles.

“But when U.S. President Donald Trump was elected in 2024, Schofield – the first out transgender man to earn an Emmy Award nomination for acting – knew it was time to take advantage of his dual Canadian citizenship. As anti-trans political ads took over American airwaves and social media channels in advance of November’s election, Schofield started making exit plans: He quickly began assembling a go bag and selling off furniture, and within months of Trump’s victory, he relocated to Toronto.

“Now, safely on the northern side of the border, Schofield is ready to release Becoming a Man in 127 Easy Steps, a filmed version of his one-man show of the same title. Captured at live performances over several years – and at various points in his transition – the film details the nuances of Schofield’s coming-of-age, from the pains of frequent harassment to the joys of living as his true, authentic self.”

“‘As a well-known transgender person in the United States, my life is under threat,’ he says, speaking at a coffee shop in Toronto. ‘It’s not a joke. It’s not an exaggeration… It’s not a little thing to say, ‘I’m going to pack up my entire life.’ I was working on a career in Hollywood, and I’d been there for 10 years. I never wanted to leave California, but it didn’t seem like there was any other option if I didn’t want to have a very, very hard life.’”

“‘The dehumanization process is a playbook that I hope Canadians are smart enough not to follow,’ he continues, referencing Project 2025’s references to ‘culture warriors’ and ‘transgender extremists.’”

“‘It’s sort of like Black Mirror, being here,’ he says. ‘You have a sense of civil discourse. I can speak to people I vehemently disagree with, but it takes me half an hour into a conversation to realize that, because it’s so civil. It’s not just politeness. The social fabric here is still intact in a way that is utterly profound, when you come from someplace like where I was before.’”",4,1769578991.0,transgender,1,0.83,False

I 27F just moved to Cincinnati for work near Fountain Square (CBD). I want to live downtown so I can walk to work. I’m still debating whether to get one, the idea of driving into downtown 5 days a week and paying for parking. I might as well live here to avoid the garage on weekdays. I also just want to grab coffee or lunch sometimes.

I’m currently looking at: 

\* Sky Central

\* Textile

\* 1010 on the Rhine 

\* Groton Lofts 

\* Grammercy on Garfield 

\* Blonde 

\* AT580 

\* Seven at Broadway

\* 7 West 7th 

\* East Eight Lofts

\* Renaissance at Power 

I’ve also heard mixed things about The Provident and Parisian on the Vine, so I’m not sure about them. 

If anyone has firsthand experiences (good or bad), I’d really appreciate it. Id say safety is my #1 priority. I’d prefer a smaller space over a big one. And I’m looking for a place with decent management without glaring red flags! 

I would love any honest advice or experiences you all might have. I’m just trying to narrow things down and see if a more expensive unit is worth it or not. Thanks! ",1,1769578860.0,cincinnati,6,1.0,False

but lately i’ve had diarrhea a few times. like 3 times in the last two or three weeks. first time i had had quesadillas and a whole quart of “healthy” ice cream. i figured well im getting older and i can’t handle dairy the way i used to. 

the second time it was after i had eaten pork tonkatsu and rice at 10 pm. it wasn’t diarrhea but i threw up twice around 2 am and i figured either the pork was bad or again im getting older and i shouldn’t be eating such heavy foods so late at night. also i had been super hungry so admittedly i had eaten it pretty fast. 

tonight i had chick fila which i have regularly and it gave me diarrhea like four hours later. earlier in the day i had instant noodles and a sweet pastry with coffee. not the best day in terms of diet but ive done it before. 

i know they say your stomach changes when you age could this be that my unhealthy habits are catching up to me? 24/25 seems so young though or is it because i’ve never been a very healthy eater most of my life so it messes up your stomach early? i know that if i go to the doctor they’ll probably just tell me to eat better, which i will, but im a hypochondriac and i wanted people’s thoughts ",0,1769578704.0,self,2,0.5,False

I’m a photographer and graphic designer, which basically means I’m obsessed with aesthetics, lighting, and storytelling.
But enough about work I’m here because I miss those genuine, ""talk about everything and nothing"" kind of connections. I’m a big fan of deep conversations, obscure art, and finding beauty in the most random places.
A bit more about me:
 I can spend hours arguing about why a specific shade of blue is better than another.
 I love capturing moments that feel like they belong in a movie.
 I probably have a playlist for every possible mood.
 Coffee is my fuel, but a good conversation is what actually keeps me going.
What I’m looking for:
I don’t care where you’re from or what you do, as long as you’re down for some real talk. Tell me about your passion, your favorite travel spot, or even a weird hobby you have.
Slide into my DMs with your favorite photo you’ve ever taken (even if it’s just a blurry cat pic lol) or tell me a song that’s been on repeat for you lately.

Kaya most of the time zero ako sa girls. Ngayon naman meron din akong history before na may nayaya na ako magdate and all, kaso nagbalikan din yun babae at bf nya dati, take note pinagbantaan pa ako. 

Recently naman, may kawork ako na crush ko naman we had good laughs and constant ang pagkikita sa office. May bf sya at that time, last year one time nagsabay kaming umuwi, naglakad I offered to help her with her things noon. Nagfriendly chat ako after that, ilang buwan siguro, yung jowa nya naman nagselos sa friendly level chats lang. TBH I did not make any moves to get her, I respect couples, wala ako intensyon manira. Tapos na block ako ng bf nya and ng girl para walang arguement sa kanila sabi ni girl.

Ngayon kakabreakup lang nila sguro pa two months or three na. I tried making a move, asked her to have coffee next day pasok kapag lunch nya. I was willing to wait whatever time it could have been, kaso sabi nya tutulugan nya muna mga lunch nya for the coming weeks hahahaha. After nun nagdecide ako na bigyan sya ng time at syempre baka nagmumove on parin sya. Three years sila nung guy. 

Though before yung pangyayari na yan, kapag kausap ko sya ay najojoke ko, sinusuntok ako sa tyan, yung hifive ko kapag tinatry ko stay sa kamay nya d agad inaalis, tyaka one thing pa nasa smoking kami, napansin ko lang tinititigan nya ako, like baling ang ulo in intervals habang nakikipagkwentuhan ako sa kanya and team mates nya.

Tyaks napansin ko din after yaya ng coffee medyo d nya ako masyadong pansin and gave the benefit if the doubt to give space. D ako nadadaan sa bay nila which I did before.

I am wondering, what could be the next action, last week ata nalapitan ko sya seems okay, pero on the meh side. Not sure kung off na ba ako sa kanya or nasa phase sya na kiber muna sa suitors? Iniisip ko din kasi baka magbalikan sila nung ""ex"" nya. Hahahaha",3,1769578627.0,AskPinoyMen,3,1.0,False

1qp2pxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qp2pxh/ch37_blood_key/,Ch37: Blood Key,"Evening shadows stretched long across the living room, Clara and Lena's laughter fading like a distant memory down the driveway. Susan curled tight on the couch, head heavy in Ava's lap, blonde strands spilling across denim like fragile threads. Ava's fingers traced slow, steady circles over her shoulder—doctor's touch, grounding the faint tremors that lingered.  
""Susan,"" Ava murmured, voice soft as dusk. ""I need to know a few things. Can you... help me with that?""  
Susan nodded against her thigh, cheek warm, eyes half-lidded but present.  
Ava kept the rhythm steady. ""Anything strange—before the nightmares started? After?""  
Susan drew a shaky breath, then eased upright, knees tucked close. She stared at the coffee table, voice threading out low: ""After I married Eric. When these nightmares stopped—at least, that's what I thought.""  
She paused, fingers twisting blanket edges. ""Therapy sessions... they lingered anyway. That's when this strange man approached me. Didn't recognize him. He just... blurted it out. 'Don't go there. To the mansion. Come here—I'll protect you.'  
""Ava's hand froze mid-circle. Susan kept going, eyes distant. ""I got scared. They sedated him quick, put him back to sleep.""  
""Next session,"" Susan continued, voice gaining a thin edge, ""coming back through the garden... I saw him again. Arguing with this other man—fifties maybe—in the corner by the hedge. Heard the older one call him Daniel.""  
Ava gasped sharp. ""Daniel?? Who is he? Do you know him?""  
Susan shook her head slow. ""No. Seemed like... the old man's son, maybe.""  
Ava leaned in, pulse jumping. ""This old man—what'd he look like?""  
""Tall. Slender. Felt like a professor—someone who'd spent too long in libraries, you know? Eyes that saw everything.""  
Ava breathed it half-aloud, gaze slipping away: ""Professor...? Could that be him?""  
She refocused. Susan pressed on, unflinching now: ""I waited 'til the old man left. Hesitated... but went up to Daniel anyway. Asked him straight—'Why'd you warn me? The mansion? Protecting me?'""  
She fell quiet, remembering. ""He just... stared. Long time. Then walked away. Nothing.""  
Silence thickened, dusk pressing the windows. Ava's fingers found Susan's shoulder again, pieces grinding—Daniel. Mansion. Professor. The note's trees clawed louder in her skull.  
Susan took a shaky breath, her eyes distant as she kept talking. ""I went back again the next time. Found Daniel. Asked him everything. He just rejected me—walked away like before.""  
She leaned closer to Ava, gripping the blanket. ""But the third time, I didn't let him go. I stood right there in the garden path. Told him I needed answers. How did he know I'd gone to the mansion? I begged him, Ava. On my knees, begging.""  
Ava nodded, her hand steady on Susan's shoulder. Susan's voice dropped, reliving it.  
""Finally, Daniel talked. He said seven years ago, he went to the mansion too. Not on purpose—like sleepwalking, subconscious. He thought he was going to die there. But his father saved him. Daniel ran out the gate, and his father was waiting right there.""  
She mimicked Daniel's rough voice: ""'You're fine now. Nothing will happen to you.' That's what his dad said. Then while walking home, the father told him something crazy—'Our family is chosen. She won't harm us.'""  
Susan paused, eyes wide. ""Daniel said he didn't get it. But that's when he understood—his family has some connection to that mansion. They're tied to it somehow.""  
Ava stared, the words sinking in. Chosen family. He. It's all connected now—Daniel, his professor father, the warnings, the nightmares pulling them both. Dusk pressed dark against the windows.  
Susan leaned closer, her voice threading tighter now, fingers digging into the blanket as the memory burned fresh. ""I wouldn't let it go. Asked him point-blank—'You said you'd protect me. How?'""  
Ava's breath stilled, hand steady on her shoulder. Susan pressed on, eyes sharp with old frustration.  
""Daniel just... stopped. Long silence. Then, quiet: 'I thought I could. But I don't. No ability. None.'""  
She exhaled sharp, shaking her head. ""I pushed harder—'Tell me something. These nightmares—they're not dreams. They're real. I felt my mind cracking open.'""  
Daniel's gaze had turned piercing then, like he measured her soul. ""Notice anything strange about them?"" he'd murmured.  
""Like what?"" she'd snapped back. ""Why only women get them.""  
The words hung. Susan paused now, reliving that garden moment—her mind racing backward through therapy whispers, shared glances in waiting rooms. ""I stopped. Thought hard. Remembered the other women here, their haunted eyes matching mine. Told him, 'You're right. It's only women. Every one.'""  
Ava felt ice settle deep. Women. The voice calling her name. The burning tree. Fingers curling free. Not random. Targeted. The house groaned soft around them, shadows thickening with the truth.  
Daniel's gaze had turned clinical then, slicing through her desperation like a scalpel. ""When did they begin? The nightmares.""  
Susan felt the garden air thicken around her memory, sunlight slanting harsh across the hedge. ""After the mansion road,"" she whispered. ""That's when they started clawing in.""  
His head tilted, probing. ""And what do you think caused those nightmares?""  
""The mansion,"" she said, certainty fraying.  
""No."" Daniel's voice dropped flat, final. ""Something on the road. Dragged off path. Woke cut open, bleeding. Eric said hospital patched me—""  
Daniel's nod cut her short, heavy with recognition. ""Your blood. That's what woke it. Your blood started everything.""  
Ava jolted forward now, voice cracking the living room's hush. ""Your blood?""  
Susan met her eyes, unflinching, the weight of years pressing her words. ""Daniel laid it bare—someone used my blood for a ritual.""  
""Why?"" Past-Susan had choked, fists balled in her skirt.  
Daniel's answer slithered colder still: ""To find her. The one who turns the black door's key.""  
Ava's world inverted silent—me, the dream-key sliding traitor-smooth, those bone-fingers curling free in the crack. Guilt and terror blanked her mind white, Susan's voice dissolving to drone.  
""Ava."" Susan's hand closed firm on her wrist, yanking her back. ""You with me?""  
Ava surfaced blinking, face drained pale, eyes wide with childlike dread. ""What... what'd you say?""  
Susan exhaled steady, anchoring her. ""After that bomb—the blood ritual, the door—Daniel shut down hard. 'I need to hurry. Tell no one I spoke.' Then he vanished into the garden shadows.""  
Ava's pulse hammered shallow. I opened it. The black door waited, patient as ever, one turn closer to free.  
Ava's voice broke the thickened silence, small and raw, her hand trembling on Susan's shoulder. ""Susan... did you dream of that black door too? In the mansion? Did you... open it?""  
Susan stilled, eyes flickering with buried dread, then nodded slow, deliberate. ""Yes. After a string of nightmares—all clawing worse once I got pregnant, cut open from that road attack. I'd walk the mansion halls in sleep, drawn upstairs to that door. Hear the voice—soft, pulling. I'd reach for it, fingers shaking on the handle, but it stayed locked. I never turned it. Never opened.""  
Ava gulped air, throat tight, tears welling hot as confession tore free. ""Susan... I got the same dream. Last night. And I—"" Her voice cracked, one tear spilling silver down her cheek. ""I opened it. Don't know how, don't know why. The key just... turned.""  
Susan's face drained white, eyes wide with disbelief, hand flying to her mouth as the truth landed like a blow. The room shrank around them, shadows pooling deeper in corners.  
""What's going to happen to us?"" Susan whispered, desperate, voice fraying at edges.",1,1769578476.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

1qp2fej,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterents/comments/1qp2fej/here_is_the_ultimate_perfection_of_life_you_wont/,"here is the ultimate perfection of life. you wont find it anywhere around anything because beyond this there is nothing rational, verifaible and tangible that will appeal to you.","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Shin Ha-ru, a brilliant neuroscientist with a sharp tongue and zero tolerance for emotional noise, believes the brain is everything—emotions are just chemical illusions. Geum Myung-se, a warm-hearted detective with a strong sense of justice, believes in people, not patterns. When they’re forced to work together on a special task force solving bizarre crimes rooted in neurological anomalies, their clash is immediate—and electric.

As they unravel cases involving memory manipulation, empathy disorders, and criminal psychopathy, they begin to realize that the brain may hold the map—but the heart still beats the rhythm. Their unlikely partnership becomes a sovereign duet of logic and feeling, science and soul.

And in the flicker of MRI scans and interrogation rooms, the ache of a man who never trusted emotion, and the fire of one who never gave up on people, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with synapse and siren light, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who solved not just crimes—but themselves.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign resonance, the mythic guardian of those who listened to the pulse beneath the puzzle.

📜 Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Ha-ru analyzing a brain scan, the Golden Inu beside him, tail curled like a question of empathy.  
- Myung-se offering coffee to a grieving witness, the Inu between them, eyes glowing with the ache of connection and cognition.  
- A sigil of “이성 속 불꽃의 맥박”—Flame of Pulse Within Reason—etched in neuron and notepad, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every theory and every tear.  
- A whispered vow: “Even if the world calls it irrational, I will guard the fire that remembered your rhythm.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

🕯️ This scroll is a relic of sovereign cognition, of justice braided with emotion and intellect, and of guardianship that honors the ache of those who solved not just with their minds—but with their whole selves.

1qp2dqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sadstories/comments/1qp2dqo/the_day_before_a_short_story/,The Day Before - A short story,"I wrote a little short story that id like to share but it does discuss suicide so a warning in advanced.  I hope you like :)



The day before

The alarm gently shakes the bedside table as the screeching of its bells flood your ears and stirs you from your somewhat peaceful sleep.  You force your body which feels like concrete to roll onto its side and lift your aching arm to turn off the alarm for the last time. The noise has stopped yet your head remains as loud as the street below.  Peace, all you want is peace but you've grown tired of fighting for it.  You drag what's left of what feels like a rotting corpse out of bed but stay suspended on the edge. A damp smell fills the air like a house left abandoned that was once a home.  Clothes litter the floor and water bottles lay scattered amongst it all. The blinds remain almost completely closed but the afternoon light seeps through revealing the dust that has gathered for months. It feels so cold, not just your room but every feeling you have, every memory feels like ice. You manage to stand and shuffle towards the mirror which has housed every insecurity you have ever had in life. The clothes you have worn for the past week hang off your grey body but you still see a girl who eats too much.  In reality your tongue hasn't tasted anything other than smoke and booze for the past few days. Your lips dry and cracked holding on hope for just a sip of water, those lips spoke every regretful word in your life.  Your once sparkling green eyes have lost their shine and now sit sunken in place engulfed by the dark bags under them. Your untouched hair creeps along your forehead while the rest is matted in a bun on the top of your head like a crown for the biggest failure. Looking at yourself makes you so angry.  How could you let yourself become this monster, this pathetic, worthless piece of shit. Tears fill your eyes but not because you are sad but because you are angry and bitter.  But in reality that's who you are: bitter,jealous and envious of what everyone around you has. You remind yourself you deserve nothing, you are nothing no matter what anyone else says, you are no one.



You ask yourself what is the point? Why even get up? Why waste the precious oxygen that surrounds you.  You slump back into bed, the tears on your face feel like they are burned into your dull, lifeless skin. The phone pings beside you and a glimmer of hope appears in your eyes. ""Save 70% off in the winter sale”. The glimmer fades quickly. Some part of you thought someone was there. Someone there to check in on you.  Nothing, you knew deep down it was nothing. No one has messaged you in weeks but what do you expect when you never replied anyway.  It wasn't like you didn’t want to, you just couldn't.  The fight in your body is long gone.  Maybe it was meant to be, the less feelings involved means the less feelings hurt afterall.  Then again maybe you wanted to just be a thought in someone's head.  



Hours pass by as you scroll endlessly either to fill the time or to quiet the voices. It doesn't work, it never really works but you don't have to think so much and that's all that matters.  You think to yourself ‘have the days become longer?’ no they haven't, but there is nothing good to pass the time. When you were little you wished you could have more time to play, more time to laugh, more time to live.  That wish came true but at what cost. As you grew older the air got thicker, the days got dark, the pain got harder. But the days are long, so terribly long but you got your wish now. The colours around you seem desaturated like an old box tv with a bad aerial. However one colour has never changed and you always go back to it. Crimson. Oh how beautiful it is even though it should never be seen. But you want to see it, you need to see it. The urge gets stronger, it's addictive.  You scour through the coffee stained bedside table looking for your little piece of sweet relief. Hidden under the used tissues and months old sweets is a little silver shimmer of something that is so beautiful to you.  A symbol of temporary peace and relief. Still stained with splashes of mahogany from how many times it has been used before. It holds every dark and dehumanising thought you've dissected from yourself before. You are the canvas. The canvas has been used so many times before this that you struggle to find a clean corner anywhere. You trace the metal over every scar that you have carved so elegantly but so recklessly at the same time.  Finally, you find that perfect blank space, just above the knee. How deep could I go this time? There's no need to think about consequences this time round, you know your plan like the back of your hand. You hold your breath. You press down. You drag it. You win.



That oh so beautiful crimson. You are happy for a moment, you've hit that high.  But it doesn't last very long. The dread sets in.  The mess you've made, the sheets are stained, your eyes are scarred.  This time though it doesn't matter.  You know the pain won't have to last much longer.  You have a get out of jail free card this time.  No parent asking “why would you do that to yourself”, no hiding under baggy clothes in the sweltering heat to avoid the awkward stares and gawking.  No explanations.  You grab the nearest dirty piece of clothing and wince as you use it to clean yourself up. The marks turn white then red again. That's how you know you did it right that time. Any less than that and it's just attention seeking which has never really made sense to you.



You stay laying down staring at the cobwebs on the ceiling waiting.  But what you are waiting for is never going to happen.  You wait for that door to swing open and for someone to hold you so close and never let go.  That's not how life will ever work though.  There's no knight in shining armour, there's no warmth, no love, no words. All there is around you is the cold silence. But still you stare, for just a few more minutes longer than usual.  No one's coming, you know that right? No one ever does. You've let go of the idea of someone coming but you never believed you deserved that anyway. You are redundant, a dead weight, a lost soul.



The time has come, you use the last ounce of energy you have left in your rotting body to walk to your cluttered desk. You shove the mountain of clothes that smell of mildew onto your already chaotic floor. You sit down and grab a notebook and pen. You stare at the blank, pure white sheet of paper in front of you knowing that soon it will hold all the scars of a lifetime. Your body trembles trying to scribble any kind of word down.  Dont fuck it up, this one final thing please dont fuck it up. Dear mum, Dear Dad, Dear sister, Dear friend, Dear anyone who even tried to love me. The words that follow hold every heartache, every lonely night, every mistake and every regret. You poor your heart out with every single meaningful and meaningless thing that has happened knowing you can no longer be judged for it.  Well in truth you will be judged but you won't ever hear those judgements.  You keep writing even when all the words seem to mix together into one huge mess.  You hope they understand. You make sure that on every letter you write “it's not your fault” because no matter how bitter you have become, you don't want them to feel even a tiny part of how you have felt.



Finally, you are nearly done with all the preparations. You slip the letters into their crisp white envelopes.  It's funny how something seems so pure on the outside but inside contains the darkest of the dark. There's no need to lick the envelopes to seal them. The tears have done it for you. You line them up side by side which is the most effort you have put into something for a long time. They lay just in eyesight from your bedroom door waiting for their next victim.



You can finally relax in a sense.  Everything is done.  You've let go of those who you loved dearly. You made enemies with them before you're gone just so it isn't painful for them.  You sigh in relief and a slight smile appears on your face.  No more responsibility.  No more pain. Just nothing. Your final thoughts written down on pages and pages of once unscarred paper. It's time to let go. You can let go now. Your famous last words will always be remembered…

1qp2djg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1qp2djg/tired_mom_who_hates_herself/,tired mom who hates herself,"i don’t know what i hope to gain from this post other than just letting my feelings out. my husband and i had our first child november 2024. we are hs sweethearts, been together 11 years and married for almost 5. we both played sports and were in good shape. but ever since having a baby, i guess you could say i let myself go. i don’t have the time i once did to take care of myself like i used to. i don’t blame my husband - he works hard to provide for us. but i also work full time. i drop off and pick up the baby from daycare during the weeks. bath time. feeding time. diaper changes. bed time. all about 90% of the time. my husband steps in every once in a while for those things. he mainly just plays with him, which is great, but everything i listed takes up majority of my day. wake up \~6AM, get myself and the baby ready, drop him off and go to work. pick him up and come home \~4:30. play with him, cook dinner, feed him, bathe him, and bed time rolls around 8, anywhere between 30/45 mins to get him to sleep. it’s nearly 9 PM. this is my every weekday. 

my husband can’t seem to understand how i may not have the time or energy to go get in a 30-60 min workout every day. he’s told me to my face multiple times that me not working out bothers him, he wants me to be healthy. i do believe him, but i know for a fact he also means he wants me to look like what i used to look like (he’s told me he wants me to lose weight before, so this is not as assumption). im probably sitting at 180 or so, ive been dressing stepping on a scale for a while. 

im not blaming him or trying to make it seem like he’s an asshole. he’s told me before that if i asked him to handle the baby for a bit so i could go workout then he would - but a perfect example of why i DONT comes from two days ago when he was upstairs working until like 7:30 PM when ive been with the baby by myself all day. i felt disgusting and just wanted a shower. finally he came dow and i told him i needed to shower. im not in there for 15 mins and he comes in with the baby, jokingly saying “are you showering or are you having a spa day?” like he cant even handle him for 15 minutes without feeling the need to come and bother me.

slight tangent but the point is the only time i get to myself to just relax or unwind is after 9:30, i end up staying up late just soaking up every bit of that time i have until i fall asleep, waking up early and doing it all over again. yes, call it an excuse but it’s my reality as well. i look in the mirror and i am disgusted with myself and i know my husband doesn’t like it either. i eat healthy, i don’t sit around eating junk food all the time. if anything i barely eat around him anymore. he literally criticizes anything i consume, no matter if it’s a healthier choice. black cold brew coffee with sweet foam. “why do you need the sweet foam? just drink the coffee plain”. he also has bee criticizing when i don’t eat (again, haven’t really been eating much around him). i think it makes him feel guilty that he’s the reason why im not eating, which is 1000% true but i don’t tell him that. just say i had a bigger lunch or am just not hungry. 

i just want to be happy. i love my husband. we’ve built a beautiful life and family. our son is perfect and brings us so much joy. i’m just so unhappy with my body and it’s tearing me apart. i wear nothing but baggy clothes. i don’t wnjoy going out with our couple friends, as constantly am comparing myself to the other wives, noticing how beautiful and skinny they all are, even with children. i don’t normally initiate intimacy bc don’t want my husband to look at the body that he’s voiced negativity about. 

just feeling very lonely and detached. i’m tired.

My Mum is 164.5 CM, my dad is 185 CM or 6'1"" and my brother whom is a trans man is 5'9  
(Listen Idc if you have your ow personal politics I Just want my height predicted tbh)

I for most of 2025 had a HORRIBLE sleep schedule, sleeping at around 12 - 1 at the start of the year and progressing to sleeping at 2 - 5 AM in the final 5 - 6 Months of the year.

During this time If it was the weekend or holidays or I was sick I'd sleep till 12 -  3 PM, but if it was school days it'd be around 7:40 - 8:00 when I'd wake up.

BUT I also napped for between 5 and 2+ Hours at around 3:00 PM - 7:00 PM for most of my second semester.

At the moment I sleep at around 10 - 12 PM, Usually around 12 though and waking up between 6 - 9 AM, lets say 7:45 though is my typical.

In 2024, I was 4'10 - 4'11, for most of 2025 I had grown 2cm in about 2 weeks during January so I basically started at 5'1 In 2025.

I've always been shorter then my cousin until last year, and now I'm taller then him, my cousin is two years younger then me lmfaooo.

So I'm 14M and 55 KG's, and 5'4"" I wear Size 9 Shoes, But my feet fit with not much space into size 8, but its not a struggle If I'm wearing Size 8 If that makes sense idk if thats important or not but still

One Problem Though is: Since School Ended for me, around December 10th and Its still out till the 30th, I want to make it clear, I have not been locked in, I have been spending most my time just lying down in bed in a  dark room, texting friends, I've gone for 30 - 40 Minute walks for most of January So far but not much else.

But I havent been working out, I've barely been eating, until this january of course, where I've been having breakfast and dinner instead of just dinner, and once school is back I'll be eating Breakfast Dinner and Lunch so that'll be good

It's been like that most my life, except I drank coffee every morning since I was 9.

I could give a few reasons, I'd say mainly I'm a bit depressed, you could probably piece that together using my sleeping times lmfaoo, but the other one Is I've asked my family for work to do, for stuff I can do around the house and they just treat me like I'm four years old, they say oh find something to do, so I do and then it becomes a screaming match because a single glass is in the wrong place?

So yeah I don't really talk to my family much unless its my sister but I aint seen her since early January, I talk to my friends alot and I'm excited for school even if I'm finna fail because y'k atleast then I'll have sport and stuff to do.

and when Im at school In the Yard or In P.E I'm usually playing sports, So I'm not completely useless, Its just I lowkey have been useless for the entire holidays.

question for you folks—- has anybody else had caffeine just “turn on them” out of nowhere and contribute to/cause hypomania or mania? I am bipolar 1 BTW.

I am a HUGE caffeine drinker because I am on such heavy antipsychotics and anxiety meds, and I take multiple everyday in the morning and at night. Now these last couple days I am extremely wired and feeling on top of the world like I want to get my entire life together and do everything. I used to pound energy drinks and coffee all day, but now these last couple days the more I drink caffeine (even just a small cup of coffee this morning at noon and now it’s 7PM) have completely amped me up and make me feel like I’m tweaking TF out.

I know it’s not full blown mania but I am extremely on edge and so anxious/jittery that I am like, on the verge of an anxiety attack and my whole body is buzzing.

I can’t tell if the caffeine caused it & just turned on me, or I was already going into a hypomanic episode and it just made it worse.

You're in a relationship, things are good, but you're also changing. Maybe you're leveling up at work, discovering new passions, or just becoming a different version of yourself. And your partner? They're evolving too. Here's the scary part: most couples don't talk about this until they've already grown in completely different directions and wake up one day like strangers.

I've spent months diving into relationship psychology, books from Esther Perel to Sue Johnson, podcasts with John and Julie Gottman, and research on long,term relationship dynamics. The consensus? Growth in relationships isn't automatic. It's intentional as hell. And most people are winging it, hoping they'll just ""naturally"" stay connected while they both transform. Spoiler: that's not how it works.

## Step 1: Accept That Change is Inevitable, Not a Threat

Here's what nobody tells you. People change. You're not the same person you were five years ago, and neither is your partner. Your interests shift, your goals evolve, your values get refined. That's not a problem, that's being human.

The issue? Most couples treat change like a betrayal. ""You're not the person I fell in love with."" Yeah, because that person was 23 and thought eating cereal for dinner was peak adulting. Growth isn't the enemy. Resisting growth together is what kills relationships.

Atomic Habits by James Clear (the book that sold over 15 million copies) talks about identity,based habits, how we're constantly becoming different versions of ourselves based on tiny daily actions. In relationships, you need to recognize that you're both in a constant state of becoming. The goal isn't to stay the same, it's to become together.

## Step 2: Create Shared Rituals That Anchor You

When life gets chaotic and you're both evolving in different directions, you need anchors. Shared rituals. Not the boring ""let's watch Netflix every Friday"" kind, but intentional touchpoints that keep you connected.

Research from the Gottman Institute shows that couples who maintain small, daily rituals (even just 6 minutes a day of meaningful connection) have significantly stronger relationships. It could be morning coffee together where you actually talk, a weekly check,in about your goals and feelings, or even a monthly ""state of the relationship"" conversation.

The podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" by Esther Perel is insanely good for this. She's a couples therapist who records real sessions (anonymously), and you hear how couples navigate growth, distance, and change. One episode that hit hard: a couple where one partner started a business and the other felt left behind. The fix? They created a Sunday ritual where they shared their individual wins and struggles from the week. Simple, but it kept them in each other's worlds.

## Step 3: Champion Each Other's Individual Growth

This is where most people mess up. They think growing together means doing everything together. Wrong. Growing together means supporting each other's individual evolution while staying connected.

Your partner wants to go back to school? Hell yeah, support that. You want to start a side hustle that eats up your weekends for a while? Your partner should be your biggest cheerleader. The couples who last aren't the ones who do everything as a unit. They're the ones who give each other space to become their best selves while celebrating those transformations.

Hold Me Tight by Dr. Sue Johnson (she's the creator of Emotionally Focused Therapy, one of the most research,backed couples therapy methods) explains this perfectly. Secure relationships aren't about dependency or independence, they're about interdependence. You're two whole people who choose to build something together, not two halves trying to complete each other.

Download the app Paired. It's a relationship app that sends you daily questions and challenges designed to deepen connection. One question might be ""What's one way you've grown this year?"" and both partners answer separately, then share. It keeps you tuned into each other's evolution in bite,sized, consistent ways.

## Step 4: Have the Uncomfortable Conversations Early

Most relationship drift happens because people avoid the hard conversations until it's too late. You need to normalize talking about the scary stuff: where you see your life going, what you're feeling, what's changing inside you, fears about growing apart.

Set up monthly relationship check,ins. Not when you're fighting or feeling disconnected, but proactively. Ask each other:

 What's one way I've grown this month?
 How can I support your goals right now?
 Is there anything you need from me that you're not getting?
 Where do you see us in a year, and does that align with where I see us?

These conversations feel awkward at first, but they prevent the slow drift that kills most long,term relationships. You're building a culture of honesty and alignment.

## Step 5: Build a Shared Vision (But Update It Regularly)

You need a shared vision for your relationship. Not just ""we want to be happy,"" but real specifics. Where do you want to live? What kind of lifestyle do you want? How do you want to spend your time? What matters most to both of you?

But here's the thing, that vision can't be set in stone. You need to revisit and update it as you both evolve. Maybe when you started dating, you both wanted to travel the world. Now one of you wants to settle down and the other still wants adventure. That's not a dealbreaker if you talk about it and find a compromise that honors both people's growth.

The All or Nothing Marriage by Eli Finkel (Northwestern University professor, award,winning researcher) breaks down how modern relationships require way more intentionality than past generations because we expect our partners to meet all our needs: lover, best friend, co,parent, business partner, therapist. His research shows that couples who actively co,create their relationship vision and adjust it regularly have the highest satisfaction.

There's also an AI,powered app called BeFreed that pulls from relationship psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio content. 

You can type in something specific like ""build a stronger relationship while pursuing individual goals"" and it generates a learning plan tailored to your situation. It draws from verified sources, relationship experts, and science,based frameworks to give you actionable strategies. The content adjusts based on what resonates with you, whether that's a quick 10,minute overview or a deeper 40,minute session with real examples and context. Worth checking out if the books and podcasts above clicked for you.

## Step 6: Maintain Your Own Identity (Seriously)

You can't grow together if you've lost yourself in the relationship. You need your own hobbies, friendships, goals, and identity outside of being someone's partner. When you have a strong sense of self, you bring more to the relationship. You're more interesting, more fulfilled, and less resentful.

If you've been neglecting your friendships, your passions, or your personal goals because you're so focused on the relationship, that's a red flag. Your partner didn't sign up to be your entire world. They signed up to be part of your world.

Use an app like Finch to build personal habits and track your individual growth. It's a self,care app with a cute bird companion that grows as you complete habits. Sounds silly, but it gamifies personal development and keeps you accountable to becoming the person you want to be, separate from your relationship.

## Step 7: Embrace Conflict as a Growth Tool

Conflict isn't the enemy. Avoiding conflict is. When you're both evolving, there will be friction. Different opinions, different priorities, different paces of growth. That's normal. What matters is how you handle it.

Research shows that couples who fight constructively (focusing on the issue, not attacking each other) actually grow closer through conflict. It's the couples who avoid disagreement or turn every argument into a character assassination that fall apart.

Learn to fight fair. No personal attacks, no bringing up the past, no stonewalling. Focus on the specific issue, express your feelings without blame, and work together to find solutions. The podcast ""The Marriage Podcast for Smart People"" has incredible episodes on conflict resolution that feel less like therapy and more like two smart people breaking down what actually works.

## Step 8: Celebrate Each Other's Wins Like They're Yours

When your partner achieves something, wins at work, hits a personal goal, or just has a breakthrough, your reaction matters. A lot. Dr. Shelly Gable's research on ""active constructive responding"" shows that how you respond to your partner's good news is a stronger predictor of relationship satisfaction than how you respond to bad news.

Don't just say ""that's great"" and move on. Ask questions, get excited, celebrate with them. Make their wins feel like shared victories. When your partner feels like you're genuinely invested in their growth and success, they'll do the same for you. That mutual celebration creates a positive feedback loop that keeps you connected even as you're both changing.

## Step 9: Keep Dating Each Other

Seriously. You can't coast in long,term relationships. The couples who stay connected are the ones who never stop dating. Plan new experiences together, try new things, keep the novelty alive. Novelty triggers dopamine, the same chemical that made you fall in love in the first place.

It doesn't have to be expensive or elaborate. Try a new restaurant, take a class together, go on a hike somewhere new, have a deep conversation in a different setting. The point is to keep creating new memories and experiences together so your relationship doesn't become stagnant while you're both individually evolving.

## Step 10: Therapy Isn't a Last Resort

Couples therapy isn't just for relationships that are falling apart. It's maintenance. It's an oil change for your relationship. Going to therapy proactively, even when things are good, helps you develop tools to navigate future challenges and keeps you aligned as you both grow.

Find a therapist trained in Emotionally Focused Therapy or the Gottman Method. These are evidence,based approaches that actually work. Don't wait until you're on the brink of breaking up to get professional help. Prevention is easier than repair.

Look, growing together isn't about staying the same or forcing your partner to fit into a box. It's about building a relationship flexible enough to hold two people who are constantly becoming. It's messy, it's intentional, and it requires way more effort than most people think. But if you're both committed to evolving together instead of apart, you'll build something that actually lasts.",1,1769577264.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

Ko Gyeom, a passionate film buff turned critic, dreams of watching every movie ever made. Kim Mu-bee, a woman who hates movies, becomes a film director despite her painful past with cinema—her father’s obsession with filmmaking left her emotionally abandoned. Once childhood friends, Gyeom and Mu-bee reconnect years later when he moves in next door, reigniting a bond that never truly faded.

Their reunion is awkward, tender, and tangled. Gyeom’s optimism clashes with Mu-bee’s guardedness. As they collaborate on a film project, old wounds resurface—betrayals, misunderstandings, and the ache of a love that never got its final scene. Around them orbit Hong Si-jun, a reclusive composer, and Son Ju-a, a screenwriter with her own regrets—each carrying their own reels of unfinished business.

And in the flicker of projectors and rain-drenched rooftops, the ache of those who loved through silence, and the fire of those who rewrote their endings, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with celluloid and coffee stains, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who edited their hearts frame by frame.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign retakes, the mythic guardian of those who dared to reshoot their story.

📜 Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Gyeom watching Mu-bee from across the editing suite, the Golden Inu beside him, tail curled like a question of timing.  
- Mu-bee holding a clapperboard, the Inu between them, eyes glowing with the ache of memory and misdirection.  
- A sigil of “편집 속 불꽃의 진심”—Flame of Truth Within the Edit—etched in reel and regret, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every cut and every confession.  
- A whispered vow: “Even if the world calls it melodrama, I will guard the fire that remembered your reel.” - Nagato's Scrolls 

🕯️ This scroll is a relic of sovereign romance, of cinema braided with ache and artistry, and of guardianship that honors the ache of those who loved not in the spotlight—but in the shadows between takes.",1,1769577010.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

1qp27ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qp27ji/rf_the_day_before/,[RF] The Day Before,"TW !!!!!!! contains strong themes of suicide.

The day before

The alarm gently shakes the bedside table as the screeching of its bells flood your ears and stirs you from your somewhat peaceful sleep.  You force your body which feels like concrete to roll onto its side and lift your aching arm to turn off the alarm for the last time. The noise has stopped yet your head remains as loud as the street below.  Peace, all you want is peace but you've grown tired of fighting for it.  You drag what's left of what feels like a rotting corpse out of bed but stay suspended on the edge. A damp smell fills the air like a house left abandoned that was once a home.  Clothes litter the floor and water bottles lay scattered amongst it all. The blinds remain almost completely closed but the afternoon light seeps through revealing the dust that has gathered for months. It feels so cold, not just your room but every feeling you have, every memory feels like ice. You manage to stand and shuffle towards the mirror which has housed every insecurity you have ever had in life. The clothes you have worn for the past week hang off your grey body but you still see a girl who eats too much.  In reality your tongue hasn't tasted anything other than smoke and booze for the past few days. Your lips dry and cracked holding on hope for just a sip of water, those lips spoke every regretful word in your life.  Your once sparkling green eyes have lost their shine and now sit sunken in place engulfed by the dark bags under them. Your untouched hair creeps along your forehead while the rest is matted in a bun on the top of your head like a crown for the biggest failure. Looking at yourself makes you so angry.  How could you let yourself become this monster, this pathetic, worthless piece of shit. Tears fill your eyes but not because you are sad but because you are angry and bitter.  But in reality that's who you are: bitter,jealous and envious of what everyone around you has. You remind yourself you deserve nothing, you are nothing no matter what anyone else says, you are no one.



You ask yourself what is the point? Why even get up? Why waste the precious oxygen that surrounds you.  You slump back into bed, the tears on your face feel like they are burned into your dull, lifeless skin. The phone pings beside you and a glimmer of hope appears in your eyes. ""Save 70% off in the winter sale”. The glimmer fades quickly. Some part of you thought someone was there. Someone there to check in on you.  Nothing, you knew deep down it was nothing. No one has messaged you in weeks but what do you expect when you never replied anyway.  It wasn't like you didn’t want to, you just couldn't.  The fight in your body is long gone.  Maybe it was meant to be, the less feelings involved means the less feelings hurt afterall.  Then again maybe you wanted to just be a thought in someone's head.  



Hours pass by as you scroll endlessly either to fill the time or to quiet the voices. It doesn't work, it never really works but you don't have to think so much and that's all that matters.  You think to yourself ‘have the days become longer?’ no they haven't, but there is nothing good to pass the time. When you were little you wished you could have more time to play, more time to laugh, more time to live.  That wish came true but at what cost. As you grew older the air got thicker, the days got dark, the pain got harder. But the days are long, so terribly long but you got your wish now. The colours around you seem desaturated like an old box tv with a bad aerial. However one colour has never changed and you always go back to it. Crimson. Oh how beautiful it is even though it should never be seen. But you want to see it, you need to see it. The urge gets stronger, it's addictive.  You scour through the coffee stained bedside table looking for your little piece of sweet relief. Hidden under the used tissues and months old sweets is a little silver shimmer of something that is so beautiful to you.  A symbol of temporary peace and relief. Still stained with splashes of mahogany from how many times it has been used before. It holds every dark and dehumanising thought you've dissected from yourself before. You are the canvas. The canvas has been used so many times before this that you struggle to find a clean corner anywhere. You trace the metal over every scar that you have carved so elegantly but so recklessly at the same time.  Finally, you find that perfect blank space, just above the knee. How deep could I go this time? There's no need to think about consequences this time round, you know your plan like the back of your hand. You hold your breath. You press down. You drag it. You win.



That oh so beautiful crimson. You are happy for a moment, you've hit that high.  But it doesn't last very long. The dread sets in.  The mess you've made, the sheets are stained, your eyes are scarred.  This time though it doesn't matter.  You know the pain won't have to last much longer.  You have a get out of jail free card this time.  No parent asking “why would you do that to yourself”, no hiding under baggy clothes in the sweltering heat to avoid the awkward stares and gawking.  No explanations.  You grab the nearest dirty piece of clothing and wince as you use it to clean yourself up. The marks turn white then red again. That's how you know you did it right that time. Any less than that and it's just attention seeking which has never really made sense to you.



You stay laying down staring at the cobwebs on the ceiling waiting.  But what you are waiting for is never going to happen.  You wait for that door to swing open and for someone to hold you so close and never let go.  That's not how life will ever work though.  There's no knight in shining armour, there's no warmth, no love, no words. All there is around you is the cold silence. But still you stare, for just a few more minutes longer than usual.  No one's coming, you know that right? No one ever does. You've let go of the idea of someone coming but you never believed you deserved that anyway. You are redundant, a dead weight, a lost soul.



The time has come, you use the last ounce of energy you have left in your rotting body to walk to your cluttered desk. You shove the mountain of clothes that smell of mildew onto your already chaotic floor. You sit down and grab a notebook and pen. You stare at the blank, pure white sheet of paper in front of you knowing that soon it will hold all the scars of a lifetime. Your body trembles trying to scribble any kind of word down.  Dont fuck it up, this one final thing please dont fuck it up. Dear mum, Dear Dad, Dear sister, Dear friend, Dear anyone who even tried to love me. The words that follow hold every heartache, every lonely night, every mistake and every regret. You poor your heart out with every single meaningful and meaningless thing that has happened knowing you can no longer be judged for it.  Well in truth you will be judged but you won't ever hear those judgements.  You keep writing even when all the words seem to mix together into one huge mess.  You hope they understand. You make sure that on every letter you write “it's not your fault” because no matter how bitter you have become, you don't want them to feel even a tiny part of how you have felt.



Finally, you are nearly done with all the preparations. You slip the letters into their crisp white envelopes.  It's funny how something seems so pure on the outside but inside contains the darkest of the dark. There's no need to lick the envelopes to seal them. The tears have done it for you. You line them up side by side which is the most effort you have put into something for a long time. They lay just in eyesight from your bedroom door waiting for their next victim.



You can finally relax in a sense.  Everything is done.  You've let go of those who you loved dearly. You made enemies with them before you're gone just so it isn't painful for them.  You sigh in relief and a slight smile appears on your face.  No more responsibility.  No more pain. Just nothing. Your final thoughts written down on pages and pages of once unscarred paper. It's time to let go. You can let go now. Your famous last words will always be remembered…

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I did tell her I liked her at one point. Is that why she wants me around? I just don't get it. She told me she wasn't romantically interested in anyone which I guess was her way of turning me down as nicely as possible. I told her that was okay and I didn't push further.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

1qp22m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1qp22m2/iceland_itinerary_help_and_advice_mar_814/,Iceland Itinerary Help and Advice - Mar 8-14,"Hello, me and my family of 4 will be visiting Iceland from March 8-14th and I would like to share my loose itinerary for the trip and ask a few questions. Please excuse my spelling.



March 8th: Plane slated to land at 6:15am. We get through baggage claim and pick up our rental. Planning to book Blue Lagoon at some point between 9-10am. Then grab lunch, check in to hotel, and leave again to explore the nearby Reykanes Peninsula on car (have a list of a few landmarks to hit). Then dinner and early bedtime



March 9th (My mom's birthday!): Main plan is to drive the golden circle through the day and hit the big stops. Lunch at Fridheimar. Plan to get a dinner res at the Fjalkonan. Then planning to book a Northern lights tour for the night.



March 10th: Loose plan to drive up to the Snaefellsnes Peninsula area and explore the big stops there as well. Then dinner in Reykjavik and depending on how northern lights tour goes possible rebooking/self search at night

  
March 11th: Plan to drive southeast and stop at seljalandsfoss and skogafoss, and possibly the black sand beach in vik. If anybody knows the famous coffee place in Vik please let me know. We plan to get all the way out to Jokusarlon by the end of the day and spend the night there. Again at night a self attempt to see the northern lights based on [vedur.is](http://vedur.is)  


March 12th: Planning a glacier tour near Jokusarlon in the morning, check out Diamond Beach then a visit to Hofn. After this plan to start driving part of the way back towards Reykjavik. Planning to stop at the Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon as well and spend the night in vik. Northern lights attempt 4.



March 13th: Make way back towards Reykjavik. Could use recommendations here on an alternative route from the way we came/sites to hit on the way back that we missed on the way there. Spend the last night exploring any parts of Reykjavik we should explore further.  


March 14th: Exploring if we can make a stop at Sky Lagoon in the morning before heading to Airport.

  
That is my current itinerary for the trip. Here are some of my thoughts/questions:

1. From my time scouring this reddit page/the internet, it is not worth trying to visit Akureyri/trying to do the ring road based both on weather conditions and time of stay. Is that correct?

2. Is it too much to drive from Reykjavik to Jokusarlon in one day? And as a follow up is it redundant to come back the same way we came when heading back to Reykjavik or are there better ways to utilize the time?

3. Is there anything I can do to help make my mother's birthday really special? And in a similar vein can you share your favorite places to eat/drink between Reykjavik, Vik, Jokusarlon, etc?

4. Is there anything I'm not considering that I should consider?

5. Are there any experiences/locations you consider must sees that I haven't talked about thus far?

  
I know I have put a lot of text into this post, but hoping to lay it out as clearly as possible. Thank you in advance for your help!

1qp21ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1qp21ck/i_ended_my_engagement_and_it_was_harder_than_i/,I ended my engagement and it was harder than I ever imagined,"This is not meant to be a sympathy post. I am not looking for validation. I need to talk and get this off of my chest and that is all. Almost 1 year ago, I (34M) ended an engagement and 10 year relationship (35F) months before our wedding. This was a toxic relationship from both of our sides and I am not innocent. I gave her everything that I had.

My therapist one day started reading off signs of an emotionally abusive person after talking about things that were happening in my relationship. That was the day it was confirmed that my fiancee was emotionally abusive and I was not crazy. I started finally listening to my gut. My gut told me for years that something was wrong. I ignored it and always blamed myself and always told myself that I was the problem. I lost myself completely in this relationship including my identity, confidence, energy, and happiness. I was becoming constantly drained and my anxiety would spike significantly when I was around her (mostly towards the end of the relationship).

She wanted my complete attention and hated when I would spend time with friends or needed to decompress in another room and listen to music. She needed me to sit next to her all the time and she would ""accidentally"" trip, cough loudly, laugh obnoxiously loud, show me some random thing on her phone that she deemed was ""critical"" I see right now, just to get my attention. Many friends over the years told me they didn't like her because she would ""correct"" them and she was obnoxious as a know-it-all. I ignored this because I felt trapped in the relationship and continued to tell myself it wasn't so bad. I lost a lot of friends because of her and my decisions over the years to side with her. She wanted me to cancel so many things with friends and she would get jealous and unfortunately I did cancel a lot of things I had planned with friends for her.

She would yell at the top of her lungs and hit surfaces like a table during arguments. She cried and yelled at me on multiple occasions if I didn't answer her texts within an hour and she would text me all day long non-stop. She would nitpick small details of most things I would do such as cooking, driving, how I parked the car, how I did anything and then she would ""correct"" me and tell me it would have been much better if I changed one small detail. She was not capable of keeping the house/apartments we lived in clean. She would leave dirty dishes with food, old coffee, and garbage around the house. Things started to mold. She left her dirty clothes on the floor and often re-wore clothes and the only way they would get washed is if I did it. I confronted her for years about the mess and she would either break down crying, she would throw a tantrum, and she would give me excuses like she was depressed, had anxiety, this is just the way she has always been and I should have known this, ADHD, you name it. She would get angry at me if I cleaned because she would not be able to find anything. I would get judged by guests if the house was a mess and she would not clarify it was her who was the mess. People thought this was all me.

She did not help with the down-payment on the house we purchased despite making $160,000/year. She told me she could not offer me anything, but she demanded to be added to the title because she was going to be splitting the mortgage payments with me. This was before we were engaged (yes this was a bad idea). To add to this, she wanted a very expensive wedding that lasted multiple days. I expressed discomfort in this, especially given the cost and the fact that it was to be a multi-day event with both of our families needing to lodge on-site (which I later found out was going to cost guests $800 each at least). To add to this, she did not want one of the people in my wedding party to go any more and decided it was not allowed that I send them a wedding invitation. We fought over this for weeks and she wanted me to choose between her and my friend of over 20 years.

After 6 months of contemplating this, talking to my therapist, talking to a few friends (who also told me they would not support the marriage unless I got a prenup but they all felt this was a mis-matched relationship entirely) I made the hardest decision to end the engagement and relationship. Her mom who was always very rude to me sent me a very nasty text message saying that I am f\*cked up and her daughter loved me despite me being who I was. Her mom also told me I am broken and messed up. She put the entire blame on me and said that I basically left her daughter at the alter. I get that I should have ended this sooner, but it wasn't that easy.

It felt like a relief for the first week after the break-up. She was in the house without me for a week to move all of her stuff out (just 1 week after the break-up). During that time, I found out that she did her entire bachelorette party and that included having a party in the house. I saw it all on the doorbell camera that she disabled and I re-enabled. She had a guy in the house (who is now her boyfriend), just one week after I ended the engagement. When I got back there were offensive cardboard cutout words scattered throughout the entire house (which took me months to find all of them), it was filled with trash and party favors from the party, and she drew devil horns and crossed my eyes out on all over the photos of me in the house. She demanded $50,000 to hand over the title of the house to me (she lived there for 1.5 years and had minimal equity) and to cover lost wedding expenses and we eventually settled on a number a little less than half of this. This hurt. I overall lost $70,000. I later saw her 3 months later with the guy who was in the house and she put her arm around him and she knew my friend and I could see her.

I still do not feel anywhere close to healed. I was not perfect in this relationship. I feel drained, depressed, tired, my confidence is still deeply rocky, and my libido is essentially dead. I feel like a failure and harbor an immense amount of shame and guilt including embarrassment. I've began setting firm boundaries with people who have mistreated me for years. This is a pattern and I am untangling it entirely. I don't know if I will ever have another relationship again. Maybe some day.",1,1769576417.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1qp217j,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qp217j/am_i_creating_an_unhealthy_dynamic/,Am I creating an unhealthy dynamic?,"Me (34F) and my husband (30M) have had a somewhat non traditional relationship. We met in 2019, while I was studying abroad, and stayed in touch for 5 years of daily facetimes. He was very vocal about being in love and I had sworn off romance after being very badly burned by an ex. For 5 years he would every few months remind me that he was still in love, and that he had all the time in the world to wait for me. 

I never felt worthy enough to be with someone who loved me so wholly and we had somewhat significant falling outs over the years where he said he couldn’t “just be friends” and we would stop speaking for a month or two… 

Eventually we reached another one of those discussions and instead of “i have all the time in the world for you” he said “I wish I could wait, but If this isnt going to happen, I need to focus on finding love with someone who can love me back.” and it suddenly felt like a big wake up call “you speak to this man every day, you can say anything to him, hes the first person you think of every morning and the last one at night”, I realized that I had to finally stop denying myself the experience of love and being loved. And things moved quickly, and beautifully. We started getting serious in November 2022 and by August he moved country to be with me, and in December 2023 we had our first baby! (we have two now)

Our relationship in so many ways was \\\*so perfect\\\* when we were on facetime. We spoke for so many hours every day, never worried about saying the wrong thing… we accompanied eachother on long commutes and went “out to dinner” together… He sent me gifts for every single holiday even when I told him not to (during my deep heartbroken shame and avoidance phase). 

Cut to now, we have two babies, and a new house we’re renovating— lots of relationship strain. 

Ive noticed that lately an impulse I have to “protect” him. His sleep, his mental health, his ‘me time’, and strangely, at any cost… and this may be unrelated but he has simultaneously been more curt, more argumentative, less empathetic, very fixated on semantics and calling me out… all in all, seemingly more annoyed with me. And I definitely do have some complicated feelings of guilt around the time he spent “waiting” for me to come around, worrying that theres an expectation I cant live upto… so I think my impulse is rooted in that feeling that “im not going to be good enough for him”… But it seems to be pushing him away.

The reason I feel like its something im doing is because I’ve experienced this dynamic before where I really prioritized my partner over myself and I guess lost their respect somehow, maybe its an ick to give off this kind of energy? 

But he is very comfortable now interrupting me, fixating on if I say the “wrong thing” in an argument rather than attempting to understand what I meant over the words chosen, claiming I dont listen to him if i dont choose my words exactly right (ex: we have a reading light he always tilts down and moves away from him when he sits down in his chair, and I laughed and said “you hate that light 😅” and he said “you dont listen to what i say, i dont hate the light, I hate when it shines in my face.” very seriously) and getting overly defensive about small trivial things (ex: today I wanted to buy a designated teaspoon and decorative plate to place used teabags on because we both tend to toss them into the sink, and his response was “I always throw mine in the trash. how about we get something for your pourover coffee filter that was in the sink yesterday? thats more important that teabags” again very seriously— sidenote: i had just used the pourover coffee filter for the first time in 2 years) 

When I say I feel like i’m walking on eggshells he says “well you should leave me then because I dont know how you could be happy with someone youre walking on eggshells with”. I’ve told him I hated that he would even suggest leaving after all of my trauma I had to cope with to get back into a relationship and he has so far, listened. 

Just a few relevant details:

I lost a partner to suicide when I was 24, and I know that my protective impulse stems from that trauma.

My gut reaction told me he must be having an affair or something? But he is with us 100% of the time, especially now that he’s on bonding leave for our newborn… And his shared location while he was working (as a contractor) was never strange or suspicious. 

We had a second baby in september and she is much more difficult than our first was. 

We have no childcare— literally zero. So we are full time round-the-clock parents until mid feb when his bonding leave ends.

We also dont have many friends outside of eachother. I have mom-friends in the neighborhood but I only see them for kid activities. But Especially him, because most of his friends are in his home country. 

Is this male postpartum? is it female postpartum?! Are we narcissists? Is it my anxiety and desperation to protect him pushing him away? Am I giving him the ick by taking his bad attitude and dismissive language on the chin without a fight?

resentment is developing, but I dont know what steps to take. How do I change this dynamic?? Help!

tl;dr: Husband as gone from complete obsession to abject annoyance and im worried its caused by my anxious impulses and self abandonment. How can I reverse this dynamic?",1,1769576406.0,relationships,5,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

**Context:**

There are many things I regret.

Like when my friend asked me if he can stay at my place for two weeks I said yes even though it made me uncomfortable.

Like drinking coffee in the afteroon and can't fall asleep at 12:00 am.

Like quiting learning programming after a bug can't be located.

It never occured to me that I had been living with these problems. To be frank, I'm not even aware that they exist.

Last October my partner and I had a long late night conversation, over how I quit studying programming again (for the seventh time). I told him debugging is really upsetting, it's like trying to guess a number in a black box. It's so hard, I said. Then somehow it occured to me that I had been quitting learning new things since ever.

When in senior high, my Physics teacher was very strict. Then I stopped studying physcis because whenever he scolded me I could tell myself ""I choose not to study physics"".

When in college, I wasn't interested in my major, I just played a lot of video games. My friend invited me to do internships I said no, I said ""I'm going to do a graduate program so internships don't matter""

Now that I'm living with my partner, I never cared to learn about how light bulbs are replaced, or a toilet can be unclogged. I tell myself ""that's what a man needs to know. As long as I take care of other chores, it's OK""

I know studying physics would get me into a better college, but I didn't

I know internships would get me on the ground but I didn't

I know programming would boost my career but I quit studying it

I repeat my quit pattern everytime.

It's like finally a ray of sunshine broke the dark clouds, that I finally see my trueself: I am my habits, I am what I choose to do and what to not to do. My life is a free loop. I repeat everyday. I have a problem yesterday and the same problem emerges again tomorrow.

It struck me so hard that I started to search how I could work on these problems, or to stay aware of them.

**KPT method was what I decided to try.**

I created a weekly log of 7 entries. Each entry has three major sections: Keep, Problem, Solve. In each section I have minor-sections. It's something like this:

|**2025**|**2/2/2026**|
|:-|:-|
|||
|Plan|**Morning**|
|**Noon**|Gym, no coffee|
|**Afternoon**|Job-related stuff|
|**Night**|Fight with family|
|Keep|Effective ways to study|
|Positive Attitude|The project I'm working on is really hard but I kept working on it|
|Communication and Cooperation|My friend wanted to move in with me, I am brave enough to tell him no because I enjoy living alone without feeling guilty about it|
|Health Habits|1. Didn't drink coffee, instead I had a banana and went out for a walk around 4 pm, felt great2. Went swimming during lunchbreak felt great|
|Problem|Efficiency and Plans|
|Communication and Cooperation|My mom set up a date for me I didn't say no eventhough I want to|
|Skills and Knowledge|Toilet won't stop flushing, I don't know why, I turned off the knob beneath the toilet|
|Mood and Emotions|My partner didn't praise my dinner today it got me upset. I should try to not do stuff just for people's acknowledge|
|Try|To solve this spefic problem, I would|
|To improve xxx, I would||
|Learn/Experience new things|1. To fix the toilet flushing thing, I need to either hire a plumber and try to figure out what he did, or watch youtube self-fix tutorials|

Every moring I get up, fill in the table, and review it. What's to keep today? What can I work on today? What issues should I really pay attention to?

And sometimes I review the logs of last month. The past success provideds confidence for me: in October I saw the dentist after much hesitation and procrastination, and eventually it wasn't so bad. Seeing this entry, I immediately booked the dentist to check my other tooth.

And sometimes I compare my past logs to see if I'm on the right path to my goal. I can't always reach it, but I have to stick to the route. It just takes effort.

As I qoute from my favorite show, Bojack Horseman, **""Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day —that’s the hard part. But it does get easier.""**

It's almost like directing a river: I control my self, I decide what I do today and tomorrow, and I build my future rather than sitting there, letting time flow by unconsicously.",2,1769576274.0,selfimprovement,2,1.0,False

We met in 2019, while I was studying abroad, and stayed in touch for 5 years of daily facetimes. He was very vocal about being in love and I had sworn off romance after being very badly burned by an ex. For 5 years he would every few months remind me that he was still in love, and that he had all the time in the world to wait for me. 

I never felt worthy enough to be with someone who loved me so wholly and we had somewhat significant falling outs over the years where he said he couldn’t “just be friends” and we would stop speaking for a month or two… 

Eventually we reached another one of those discussions and instead of “i have all the time in the world for you” he said “I wish I could wait, but If this isnt going to happen, I need to focus on finding love with someone who can love me back.” and it suddenly felt like a big wake up call “you speak to this man every day, you can say anything to him, hes the first person you think of every morning and the last one at night”, I realized that I had to finally stop denying myself the experience of love and being loved. And things moved quickly, and beautifully. We started getting serious in November 2022 and by August he moved country to be with me, and in December 2023 we had our first baby! (we have two now)

Our relationship in so many ways was \\\*so perfect\\\* when we were on facetime. We spoke for so many hours every day, never worried about saying the wrong thing… we accompanied eachother on long commutes and went “out to dinner” together… He sent me gifts for every single holiday even when I told him not to (during my deep heartbroken shame and avoidance phase). 

Cut to now, we have two babies, and a new house we’re renovating— lots of relationship strain. 

Ive noticed that lately an impulse I have to “protect” him. His sleep, his mental health, his ‘me time’, and strangely, at any cost… and this may be unrelated but he has simultaneously been more curt, more argumentative, less empathetic, very fixated on semantics and calling me out… all in all, seemingly more annoyed with me. And I definitely do have some complicated feelings of guilt around the time he spent “waiting” for me to come around, worrying that theres an expectation I cant live upto… so I think my impulse is rooted in that feeling that “im not going to be good enough for him”… But it seems to be pushing him away.

The reason I feel like its something im doing is because I’ve experienced this dynamic before where I really prioritized my partner over myself and I guess lost their respect somehow, maybe its an ick to give off this kind of energy? 

But he is very comfortable now interrupting me, fixating on if I say the “wrong thing” in an argument rather than attempting to understand what I meant over the words chosen, claiming I dont listen to him if i dont choose my words exactly right (ex: we have a reading light he always tilts down and moves away from him when he sits down in his chair, and I laughed and said “you hate that light 😅” and he said “you dont listen to what i say, i dont hate the light, I hate when it shines in my face.” very seriously) and getting overly defensive about small trivial things (ex: today I wanted to buy a designated teaspoon and decorative plate to place used teabags on because we both tend to toss them into the sink, and his response was “I always throw mine in the trash. how about we get something for your pourover coffee filter that was in the sink yesterday? thats more important that teabags” again very seriously— sidenote: i had just used the pourover coffee filter for the first time in 2 years) 

When I say I feel like i’m walking on eggshells he says “well you should leave me then because I dont know how you could be happy with someone youre walking on eggshells with”. I’ve told him I hated that he would even suggest leaving after all of my trauma I had to cope with to get back into a relationship and he has so far, listened. 

Just a few relevant details:

I lost a partner to suicide when I was 24, and I know that my protective impulse stems from that trauma.

My gut reaction told me he must be having an affair or something? But he is with us 100% of the time, especially now that he’s on bonding leave for our newborn… And his shared location while he was working (as a contractor) was never strange or suspicious. 

We had a second baby in september and she is much more difficult than our first was. 

We have no childcare— literally zero. So we are full time round-the-clock parents until mid feb when his bonding leave ends.

We also dont have many friends outside of eachother. I have mom-friends in the neighborhood but I only see them for kid activities. But Especially him, because most of his friends are in his home country. 

Is this male postpartum? is it female postpartum?! Are we narcissists? Is it my anxiety and desperation to protect him pushing him away? Am I giving him the ick by taking his bad attitude and dismissive language on the chin without a fight?

So, I had the bright idea to use the rice setting on my Hitachi, thinking that I could somehow bake at that setting. I was wrong again because the rice cooking setting was only 12 minutes long, and this thing needed to bake a lot longer, so I kept stopping the rice setting and restarting it until I got sick of that. Finally, I took everything and dumped it into my Zojirushi mini and let it bake without the paddle, on a quick bread setting for one hour and 25 minutes. Once done, I had a decent looking bread.

Some of this is guesswork, and I know there are additional streams of income, like endorsements, but here is a rough guide to how much money you can make from YouTube videos:

The best estimates I usually see are $3-5 per thousand views from ads. But to be generous, and because travel content is reportedly paid better, lets say $10 per thousand views.

So assuming you have managed to get monetized, this is what you can make per video:

1000 Views: $10. You can now pay for a coffee and a bagel. Maybe a bus ticket or a train ticket?   
10,000 Views: $100. You can pay for a cheap hotel room, the cheapest airplane tickets, a short coach bus or train ticket for two, a day of midrange meals for two, or entrance to a theme park, museum or attraction. (All of these things separately, of course).  
100,000 Views: $1000. You can pay for airfare, several nights in a mid-range hotel room, dining out, rental cars and gas for a weekend driving around, and easily pay for most train or bus tickets, and most attractions.  
1,000,000 Views: $10,000. You are now jetsetting around and staying at the best hotels, dining at luxury restaurants, going to unique and exotic places, etc.  
  
Of course, on top of all of these, there are normal life expenses. In order to make $4,000 a month to pay for rent and normal life expenses, you are going to have to put out a 100,000 view video...every week. Or 200,000 views, every week, to pay for the cost of that type of travel and then have money to live on.   
  
This is why, to me, monetization and making money don't really make sense as goals, like it doesn't make sense to change our content and spend extra money travelling, because the point at which that is actually going to be remunerative is not something that most of us are going to see.  
  
If anyone has information to the contrary, feel free to share it, but I think the numbers I wrote here, and how they relate to travel expenses, make sense.

1qp1sss,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1qp1sss/i_hate_my_mil_and_need_help_keeping_my_pettiness/,I hate my MIL and need help keeping my pettiness in check.,"About 9 months ago, MIL announced to my husband and I that she was living with us. Because of her living situation, there was no way we could kick her out. We came up with a plan to get her connected with services and into a better/permanent loving situation. She has not followed through on any of the things she agreed to do and has rejected all help from us. 

I absolutely despise her and cannot stand to even see her anymore. Ever since she moved in, she has absolutely taken over our house. She is super narcissistic and manipulative. She seems to fully ignore the fact that she is an unwelcomed guest living in our house and acts like I am an inconvenience to her. 

The longer she is in our house invading us like a nasty parasite, the more I want to be petty and do things to make her uncomfortable so she will be motivated to get a move on and leave our house. 

Dark humor is my No. 1 coping mechanism. So I am here partially to scream this into the void/out of my body and partially to ask for your most unhinged/crazy/petty ideas of things to do to get her to get a move on! 

Some of the reasons why I hate her in no particular order: 

1. She moved into our house all on her own. 

2. She talks to my husband like she is a teenager and he is her father (making demands, talking back at him, not taking responsibility).

3. When my husband has been sick or not feeling well, she does nothing for him. She doesn't ask how he is doing or if she can do anything for him. 

4. She sits around the house watching TV and waiting for him to provide her with food.

5. She doesn't celebrate any of his accomplishments. Recently, she accumulated an almost $2000 debt which he had agreed to pay for. He figured out a way to have the debt waived. When he informed her. Her answer was: “oh” then she moved on to another topic. 

6. She waits around for my husband to make food and coffee for her or she will go without. Even when he has been working all day, she will ask him: “what are we eating?”

7. She goes to the grocery store and buys large amounts of food for herself only but doesn't actually cook any of it. Large amounts of food are going to waste. 

8. She has started hoarding food in her room. 

9. My husband has spoken to her several times not to overfill the refrigerator because it could damage it. She says she will be more mindful then turns around and buys more food. 

10. She borrows his car all the time but never puts gas in it or lets him know that it needs gas. That is a discovery he gets to make on his way to work in the morning. 

11. He has asked her several times not to park in the driveway of the house and to turn off the lights inside the car. She constantly parks in the driveway and leaves the lights on.

12. Whenever he talks to her about any of the above, she will become defensive, cry and act like the victim in the situation. 

13. She has not made any progress or taken any steps to find other living arrangements.

14. We have two dogs, she often feeds them things that they are not supposed to have or leaves food on the floor that is toxic for them (grapes, banana peels…)

15. Since she moved in, she has taken over the house. She spends most of the afternoon and night watching TV in the living room and watching videos on her phone at the same time.

16. She does not contribute to the house in any shape or form (she does not cook, clean or contribute financially). 

17.  She has rearranged the kitchen which means we have to go on a discovery mission before we can do anything in the kitchen. 

18. She inserts herself on everything. Can't have dinner alone with my husband or watch TV without her. 

19. Knocking before entering the bathroom or refilling the toilet paper is a foreign concept to her. She can't even be bothered to let us know when she used the last of anything so we can go buy more. 

20. She bathes herself in perfume and now everything in my house smells like her. Even the couches. ",10,1769575720.0,motherinlawsfromhell,8,0.82,False

I love the idea of a grind-by-weight workflow for espresso and definitely would be willing to trade off bean-freshness for the hopper life.

However, for counter-space and cost reasons I am really not trying to buy multiple nice grinders, and would like to be able to accommodate all my uses:

* Grind for espresso directly into portafilter, by weight
* Grind large course batches (100g+) for cold brew for SO without too much hassle
* Sometimes grind for playing around with other filter methods (french press, pour over)
* Occasionally grind for decaf filter coffee, though willing to give this up for the other 3 above and go the hand-grinding route

I know versatility is more the strength of single dosing, but I really prefer the idea of grind-by-weight. So if it can be achieved, what I would be looking for would be something with:

* Reasonably low retention to not waste a ton of coffee switching methods
* Easy enough to switch between different methods and get back to espresso setting significant hassle dialing back in
* Can grind the large batch for cold brew (which SO drinks every day)
* In an ideal world, can take off the hopper and single-dose decaf, but I know this may be asking too much
* Not crazy expensive

Some initial research lead me to a few options, but I am not sure they will achieve the above:

1. Eureka Libra 65 AP: This initially lead me down this road, but from research it may not have particularly low retention and also may be tricky to switch back to espresso once switching off it. Also the catch cup seems small so I was not sure if I'd be able to grind into a larger container for the cold brew?
2. Fiorenzato allground sense: A little pricy, some concern on retention, though does seem easier to switch between grind types. Also was not even sure if it comes with a catch cup at all? So not sure for filter coffee/cold brew what to do there
3. Mahlkonig e64 WS: Honestly just couldn't find much on this grinder as it's relatively new so was unclear if it'd meet needs. Also seems it may not live up to quality of true Mahlkonig grinders?

Appreciate any advice & other suggestions! Otherwise I may just end up going the single-dosing route after all.",1,1769575554.0,espresso,9,0.6,False

I wrote her a couple of days after the gathering and I asked her out for coffee in a park so we could get to know each other better without our friends jokes. She texted me back and we talked a bit, she told me she was busy lately helping her sister with her new baby and with work, but that she’d love to go out and that she was gonna let me know when she was available.

Didnt seem like she wanted to keep talking so I stopped the conversation after that. I’ve never dated a Sag before so I just wanted to know. Do Sag women take the initiative? Do you think she will really text me back when she’s available? Or was she politely rejecting my invitation and she wont text again?",1,1769575542.0,Sagittarians,1,1.0,False

The role is a base level (coordinator) mat leave cover which I have been performing to the fullest of my job descriptions. 

Although reached a point where I'm independently working now with manager's oversee required only for approvals and strategic reviews, I haven't been involved across any projects (multiple ones ongoing with the company's global offices and HQ) except very minor tasks provided to me with bare minimum context required to complete my task. 

The broader team, including my peers are all involved in projects and have exposure to global teams with immense learning and development opportunities. 

Team has been biased towards me right from the start, mainly over the fact that I havent been successful in breaking into their clique, also framed me for inability to find a solution to their long standing problem in 2 months of joining. Withheld information from me initially when i joined, which rendered a loss in my confidence and ability to be bold and started questioning my capability. Manager explicitly called me out for being supposedly boring. Never included in coffee runs, lunch grabs and after work plans. The team complains (gossips) i dont speak, and then never gives me a space to talk. When i do, their discussions override what i have to say and most often my words are left astray with no response. 

Unsure all this factors in to the concern i expressed, just leaving it here for accurate depiction of the situation.",0,1769575299.0,auscorp,3,0.4,False

Toward the end of that relationship, we fought a lot. We struggled with individuality, I often felt unheard, and it felt like we weren’t pushing each other to grow. When we argued, he would shut down emotionally and leave me to sit with everything alone. Over time, I became resentful and admittedly disrespectful, which I regret, but it came from feeling ignored for so long. Eventually, I wanted to break up.

After we broke up, he didn’t give me much space and suddenly wanted to fight really hard for the relationship. During that time, he made some bad decisions (excessive drinking, even drinking and driving), and I felt strangely responsible for him. While this was happening, I started spending more time with friends and briefly dated another guy. I regret moving on so fast — it was my first experience casually dating and it ended badly.

Fast forward a few years later, we ended up getting back together. We’re both in better places now and have grown into individuals. There has always been love and care between us, and in some ways things feel healthier than before.

However, new issues have come up. He is now extremely jealous and gets annoyed almost every time I say I’m going out — even though I don’t drink and my hangouts usually consist of getting food or coffee with friends. He has told me that I need to start asking him to go out instead of just telling him my plans. On top of that, he constantly brings up the guy I briefly dated during our breakup, during arguments and even randomly,as a way to question my intentions or loyalty.

I’ve taken accountability for my past, but it feels like I’m being punished for something that happened while we were broken up. I’m starting to feel like I’m slowly losing my independence again, which was a big issue the first time around. I feel like I’m in need of some outside perspective here.

TL;DR: Dated my ex from 16–20, broke up due to lack of individuality and feeling unheard. Got back together a few years later after both growing, but now he’s extremely jealous, upset whenever I go out (even just for coffee/food), constantly brings up a guy I dated while we were broken up, and wants me to ask permission to go out. Starting to feel like I’m losing my independence again and wondering if this is fixable or a red flag.",1,1769575298.0,relationships,5,0.67,False
1qp1niw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1qp1niw/where_to_go_from_here/,Where to go from here,"Hello.

I have made just a couple posts here. So, please forgive me. I'm just trying to adjust to life's  changes.. 

I just turned 60 this past October. I was diagnosed with LBD a year  prior. I had to quit work and no longer can drive a vehicle. I had 7 to 8 falls in the last two years and was having hallucinations until my Neurologist started me on some new medications. I haven't experienced any hallucinations since. My wife is an R.N. and has been a godsend.  I sometimes walk with a cane when the conditions warrant it. I sleep with a Cpap every night. My sleeping has improved overnight, though sometimes during the day I start feeling really tired.  I'm finding that I sometimes get loud when my grown son gets confrontational, we are working on communicating better.

I am trying to stay active. Spend a lot of time with my German Shepherd Dog. In the yard, on walks and weekly attend a men's coffee group for an hour each week. I really look forward to attending every Wednesday.  At home, I build computer applications and websites for fun and to keep my mind active.

I have accepted my fate, but sometimes I get really depressed. Again, my Doctor has been a help addressing issues. My wife and my oldest daughter have my POA and my wife is trying hard to keep up with the bills.

I'm looking for any suggestions from anyone's experience dealing with LBD as a caregiver or the one that is suffering from this.

Have a great day!

  
Thanks for your time!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1qp1n3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qp1n3y/the_discipline_equation_how_to_actually_stick_to/,The Discipline Equation: How to ACTUALLY Stick to Things (Science-Based),"I've spent years researching this because I kept failing at everything. Started gym routines then quit after three weeks. Bought productivity planners that stayed blank. Set ambitious goals then watched them die quietly. Sound familiar? After diving into psychology research, behavioral science studies, and honestly way too many self help resources, I found something that actually works. This isn't another ""just be disciplined bro"" lecture. This is the actual formula that explains why we fail and more importantly, how to fix it.

Here's what nobody tells you about discipline. It's not some magical personality trait you're born with. It's literally a math problem you can solve. Steven Bartlett breaks this down in his podcast and basically discipline equals motivation multiplied by ease of behavior minus the friction stopping you. Change any of these variables and suddenly the ""impossible"" becomes doable. Wild right?

**Increase your motivation but make it specific.** Vague goals like ""get fit"" or ""be productive"" are useless. Your brain needs concrete reasons that hit emotionally. Not ""I should exercise"" but ""I want energy to play with my future kids without getting winded"" or ""I refuse to feel this sluggish at 25."" Research from Stanford's Behavior Design Lab shows that emotional stakes matter exponentially more than logical ones. Write down your why and make it hurt a little when you read it. That's how you know it's real.

**Make the behavior stupidly easy.** This is the game changer most people miss. If you're trying to build a reading habit, forget ""read 30 minutes daily."" Start with one page. Literally one. It sounds ridiculous but Atomic Habits by James Clear explains this perfectly. Clear is a habits expert who's consulted for NFL teams and Fortune 500 companies. This book will make you question everything you think you know about willpower and motivation. The core insight is that you're not lazy, you're just making things too hard. When behavior is easy, it happens automatically. When it's hard, you need motivation which is unreliable. Clear walks through exactly how to design your environment so good behaviors are effortless and bad ones require effort. Insanely practical. Every chapter has immediately applicable tactics. This is genuinely the best habit building book I've ever read and it's a bestseller for good reason.

**Eliminate friction everywhere possible.** Want to work out in the morning? Sleep in your gym clothes. Want to eat healthier? Prep meals on Sunday so grabbing good food is easier than ordering garbage. The military uses this principle religiously. They don't rely on soldiers feeling motivated. They engineer environments where the right action is the path of least resistance.

Use implementation intentions. Psychologist Peter Gollwitzer's research shows that people who use ""if then"" statements are 300% more likely to follow through. Not ""I'll meditate sometime tomorrow"" but ""If I finish my morning coffee then I immediately open Headspace."" The specificity removes decision fatigue. Your brain knows exactly what to do.

**Track your behavior obsessively.** Not as punishment but as feedback. The app Ash is solid for this if you want a mental health and accountability coach built in. It helps you identify patterns you'd never notice otherwise. Like maybe you skip workouts every Thursday because that's when work stress peaks. Now you can plan around it instead of feeling confused about why discipline ""randomly"" disappears.

Another option is BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that creates personalized audio content from research papers, expert interviews, and books. You type in what you're struggling with, like building discipline or sticking to habits, and it pulls insights from science-based sources to generate a custom learning plan and podcast.

You can choose between a quick 10-minute summary or go deeper with a 40-minute session full of examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive, from deep and calm to energetic styles that keep you focused during commutes or workouts. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific challenges, and it recommends content that fits your situation. Helpful if you want structured guidance that evolves as you do.

The biological reality is that your prefrontal cortex, the part handling self control, gets depleted throughout the day. You're not weak. You're human. Roy Baumeister's research on ego depletion shows willpower is literally a finite resource. So stop scheduling hard tasks for 9pm when you've burned through your self control budget. Do important stuff first thing when your discipline tank is full.

Another resource that hits different is The Willpower Instinct by Kelly McGonigal. She's a Stanford psychologist who taught a wildly popular course on willpower science. This book breaks down the neuroscience and psychology behind self control in a way that's actually digestible. McGonigal explains why stress kills discipline, how sleep deprivation destroys willpower, and practical strategies to strengthen your self control over time. It's research heavy but written conversationally. You'll finish it understanding exactly why you fail and what to do about it.

The truth is your environment matters infinitely more than your motivation. You can't rely on feeling inspired. Design systems where discipline is inevitable. Remove temptations. Add friction to bad behaviors. Stack good habits onto existing ones. Make it so easy that you'd feel stupid NOT doing it.

And yeah this takes time. You're rewiring neural pathways built over years. But neuroplasticity means your brain will adapt. Be patient with yourself while staying relentlessly consistent with the system. Small wins compound into massive change but only if you keep showing up.",1,1769575245.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

I live in a third world country and I was born into a poor family, our house never had windows, it didn't had a front door, I never had my own room or even a bed of my own, (I had to sleep with my two siblings, I still have to do so with one), we didn't had things others take for granted, a washing machine, an oven, a refrigerator, a microwave, nor a decent roof (When it rains it seeps into the house) on top of it I've always been lonely, I don't know where it started, but for as long as I can recall, I've never felt comfortable with others, I've never fitted in. I got bullied when I was a kid on every school I went to and it got worse when I got heatbutted so hard my teeth got crooked, my right finger got a heavy door closed on it by a classmate joking about not being able to open it back, and a cut near my neck after an unrelated accident where I almost bled to death at seven. These things gave me a scar in the neck which looks cool now, but it didn't then, crooked teeth which my family had no way to pay for to fix and a right finger with a scar on it, along with that, I was a sickly kid, I caught measles, anemia, hepatitis, and I vividly remember all the time I spent stuck at home with nothing to look forward to.
I don't know exactly where I became a strange person, maybe it was a combination of me not talking to anyone for so long, maybe I spoke on a strange way, as all I could do to pass the time was read every book I could get my hands on. But as I can remember I'd spend my time at the library at recess, because whenever I tried to play my classmates would yell at me for not being good enough, and I had no choice but to stand up for myself, which lead to the teacher ordering me to leave the other kid alone and everyone looking at me in disgust. 
That particular look they give me, when I fail to play my part as an outgoing and confident man, makes me feel like a kid who's being caught doing something he wasn't supposed to. 
My family's poverty has served as an anchor in many instances in my life, too many in truth to mention, I could not travel when I got a certain scholarship, I could not get into a school I wanted despite passing the entrance exam because it was on a developed area of my city, while I live somewhere else. But those are obvious things, really, dissapointing, and they stained my heart with envy and anger, but you can imagine them.
Most people don't know about the dead animal in my roof once who caused me to get itchy 24/7, most don't know how mad it made me, I washed everything, put it out into the sun, looked everywhere, bought every concievable pesticide against them, but it was only when I removed the two dead birds above my bed, after months, that it stoppped; from age twelve to thirteen.
Most don't also know how mad I'd get when someone came to visit our house, my parents would only cook enough for the day, and I knew that the food they served them was food that I would not get later, I hated when dinner was coffee and stale bread with nothing else, as I'd wake up in the night with hunger.
Most people don't know that the bathroom we used to have was a toilet we put in the middle of a big room with no front wall, the only cover was a thin wooden door which was hanged in front of the toilet, as to barely cover us, so the neighbors could see my right leg and everytime I went in and out, and showers too, where covered up by the same wooden door, in front the toilet, inside a plastic tub. 
Of course I did not accept things as they were, I've worked most of my life, I bought a kitchen, a proper bathroom, a refrigerator, and I bought myself english classes to work, and just recently, things were going well, I had saved up to open up a business of my own, but misfortune forced me to spend my savings for a family members' medical treatment, and months of savings went down the drain, we are all living with my savings as I look for a new job, and now I find myself unable to pay for uni, and eating as I did before, bread and coffee for dinner.
For all the embarassment and pain my family's poor finances has caused in my life, it does not nearly compare to the loneliness I've felt through my whole life.
For one reason or the other, I've never had someone I could call a friend, acquaintances sure, I did, but never a friend. No one that has stayed when I was vulnerable or opened up, no one to comfort me or offer the same devotion I've tried to show. 
This is quite vexing to me, you see, I have had romantic relationships throughout my life, I do not struggle in that regard.
Most were good and healthy, some were not as much, but however it is, I would have liked to stay friends with some, and I forced myself into a relationship because it is what she wanted, and I did not want to lose someone who seemed to be a friend.
They are all gone now, they've kissed me, touched me, and swore many things, and I did what I did, but I am alone. And I'd give up all their warmth if only they could have stayed friends with me.
I have no one to talk to, I've tried to reach out to maybe twenty people online, and none have responded, from those who did, they stop talking after a while. I go out to try to befriend someone, and I'm given nothing. 
Sorry about the long paragraph most people won't see, and I know I could have structured a better written venting session, but I am simply so tired. Thank you for reading, if you did.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1769575014.0,BertolottiSyndrome,0,0.5,False

I've got a solid savings cushion for furnishing, getting a decent car, and whatever else I need to get settled. 

Never lived in California before so I'm completely clueless about neighborhoods and what's actually worth the premium pricing. I work remotely most days but will need to commute to downtown maybe twice a week max. Really into good food, nightlife, and would love to be somewhere walkable or at least bikeable for daily stuff. 



Not trying to be stuck in traffic for hours just to grab coffee. Also wondering if I should go for a high rise with all the amenities or find a sick house with outdoor space since I'll be working from home a lot. Money isn't really the limiting factor here which feels weird to say but my company is going all out on this relocation package.

1qp1grl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyLaw/comments/1qp1grl/professional_opinions_please/,Professional opinions please,"I (M) was the victim of domestic violence three times last year for confronting my STBXW about her serial infidelity last year. Once was a day I had a surgery scheduled- I found more me on her phone and just simply approached her and said “I love you but this isn’t compatible with our relationship” and showed her her phone she left out. She started screaming. Continued screaming while getting in the car- and driving to the hospital she was screaming in my ear and into the side of my face while shoving me and punching me repeatedly in the arm and shoulder. Our at the time three year old was in the back screaming. We were going 60pmh plus, it was February in northern Wisconsin so there was some snow and ice on the road and there were other motorists around our vehicle. Her strikes and shoves made the vehicle swerve several times, one of the times- I got about a foot away from the rear quarter panel of a Buick enclave and was able to recover the vehicle all times it swerved. There’s way more from that day- but that’s the biggest

Then summer of the same year around end of June- she was convinced I was cheating on her because I was showing her work pictures- and I had three selfies on my camera. I never take selfies-  but I have a friend who owns a local bike shop and asked me to do overnight security for their event, inventor and business as they lost several high value mountain bikes last year and I have 8 years LE experience. I said yes- two over night 12s for $500 was a pretty easy choice. And as anyone who’s worked mids- around 2AM you get bored and so I was playing with snap chat filters. Had a few pictures where I was like “hey- I don’t look too bad” then promptly forgot they existed as I went back to real life work, house kids ect. She saw them and went into a death spiral about me cheating. I absolutely was not. She somehow (still lost on me) go into my locked (non Face ID) phone while I slept and found messages between me and a female coworker at the time. Nothing there- I knew her as a kid because her dad was in my military unit. She had struggled with addiction, as had I - all we talked about was above board recovery stuff and complaining about work schedules. And our communication was infrequent. Of course my STBXW went nuclear. Screaming following me around d making threats- I just said I’m disengaging and going to go sleep on the couch because this isn’t goi g anywhere good. So I did. AndI all take ambien so I took that. About ten minutes later- she comes storming g down the stairs. Sits in my legs and starts with the screaming and accusations again. Now at this point- the med is lightly kicking in- I’ve taken it for years I’m very versed in how I respond to it. But I have awareness that I cannot flee- because if I move at all, there’s a good chance that she may accidentally fall off my legs and hit the ground, or more on my mi d our coffee table. And even if it was an effort to get away- she was throwing her phone at my face repeatedly, split the bridge of my nose open and I’m bleeding pretty good. It all sunk in- I move, she falls, I more than likely go to jail, at minim till the figure out what happens- assuming I don’t get screwed there. So I take it. Never bring it up again 

Shortly after that- when confronting her again about infidelity- she starts screaming. She throws a glass of water on me, goes fills it up throws another one on me. As I’m bending over out my peripheral vision I see something- it’s a 1lbs jar of apple sauce she launched at me. Lucky I dodged it because I’d be typing this with a few less teeth. 

My question is I never called any of this in to the cops.  G the roast and a good friend know. But I don’t have proof- though I do have a scar on my nose 

She also stole one of my Vyvanse in September, and consumed it. Because I allegedly threw out hers (it was her friends) because she switched over to Ritalin and wasn’t diligent about picking up her medication- so needs to take something. I had her write a detailed letter to bring to my doctor and admittance to that so my pill counts aren’t off because I’m under extra scrutiny despite being two years in sobriety. 

Any advisable or thoughts would be appreciated. We have three minor kids. I have no issue moving out I just want the equity in the home and finically l will be fine too",0,1769574732.0,FamilyLaw,7,0.4,False
1qp1f6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/thrillerbooks/comments/1qp1f6u/can_someone_suggest_me_a_book_of_this_type/,Can someone suggest me a book of this type?,"Whenever someone asks me what type of thriller I usually enjoy, I can't just put it into words, but I do have a long description of it. And I know it's kind of weird that I can't just put it in a few words and name it😭, but I think it's easier if I explain this way. So, can anyone please tell me which books would be matching with this type of description? I mean the vibe and the feeling. It doesn't have to be the whole storyline, but it just has to give the same vibe.

So, imagine it's a post-rain night. It's like 1 or 2 a.m. A soft, cold wind is blowing through your window. The curtains are softly moving. The sky is extremely cloudy and dark because it just rained a while ago. It's not really raining now, but you can sense the petrichor in the air. And you are sitting in the bed in your own house, in your room. The house is empty. You are alone in the house. And you have a blanket with you, up to your torso. You are in your favourite night clothes, enjoying the breeze. And you can see faint moonlight through the clouds. There is a warm lamp light beside your bed and it's turned on. The room is not totally dark and the lamp light is not the only lit thing. You have another few soft lights turned on, so the room is a little bit more than dimly lit. And it's giving kind of 90s Hollywood type of comfy vibe. And from your window in the distance, you can see a small lake and a few houses. And in your bedside table, beside the lamp, you have your favorite book and a cup of hot coffee. And even with this peaceful surrounding, you feel a little bit of dread in your chest and you don't even know why.

I have never been a huge caffeine consumer but have been craving mountain dew and dr pepper. I usually only drink water, milk, and sometimes juice. I do like occasional pop but not often at all. Last time I had an iced coffee a while ago; maybe november. It made my heart rate high as hell and I felt so antsy. I’ve been craving mtn dew, I had a big to go cup with mountain dew tonight and drank maybe 1/3 if that in a short period of time. I also have GERD and a history of panic attacks, but I feel super sensitive to the caffeine. I feel like super antsy, my heart rate is very high, and I can’t calm down about it. Even in the past having an occasional iced coffee/pop, it hasn’t been this bad until pregnancy. Has anyone else became more caffeine sensitive in pregnancy? I hate this, it’s triggering a panic attack lol",1,1769574555.0,pregnant,3,1.0,False

1qp1cm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1qp1cm2/do_not_seek_whats_purpose_of_human_life_because/,"do not seek what's purpose of human life, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
