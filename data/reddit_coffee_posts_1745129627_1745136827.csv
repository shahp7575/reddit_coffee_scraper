 ## Key Features Analysis

The modern driftwood coffee table is a fusion of nature and design. The unique elements inherent in reclaimed wood paired with practical design elements create a focal point that's both artistic and functional.

**Material and Construction:** The primary material is authentic driftwood, carefully selected for its unique shapes, textures, and durability. The driftwood is sourced from beaches and waterways, then cleaned, treated, and often reinforced with a sealant to protect it from the elements and ensure its longevity. Many tables incorporate a solid wood or metal frame for added stability and support, enhancing the table's overall structural integrity.

**Size and Dimensions:** Driftwood coffee tables come in a variety of sizes, ranging from small, accent pieces to large, statement tables that can accommodate spacious living rooms. Typical dimensions range from 36 inches to 60 inches in length, 20 inches to 36 inches in width, and 16 inches to 20 inches in height. The specific dimensions will influence the table's suitability for different room sizes and layouts, so it's essential to measure your space before making a purchase.

**Shape and Design:** One of the most appealing aspects of driftwood coffee tables is their unique and organic shapes. No two tables are exactly alike, as the natural contours of the driftwood dictate the final design. Some tables feature a cluster of driftwood pieces arranged to create a sculptural base, while others incorporate a single, large piece of driftwood as the focal point. Tabletop shapes vary as well, ranging from rectangular and square to round and oval, each offering a different aesthetic and functional appeal.

**Finish and Treatment:** The finish applied to a driftwood coffee table significantly impacts its appearance and durability. Common finishes include clear sealants, matte varnishes, and natural oils, each designed to protect the wood from moisture, stains, and scratches. Some tables retain the raw, weathered look of the driftwood, while others are sanded and polished to enhance their natural beauty. The choice of finish depends on the desired aesthetic and the level of maintenance you're willing to undertake.

**Glass or Wood Top Integration:** Many driftwood coffee tables feature a glass or wood top that provides a smooth, functional surface for placing drinks, books, and other items. Glass tops offer a sleek, modern look that allows the natural beauty of the driftwood base to shine through, while wood tops provide a more rustic and cohesive aesthetic. The choice between glass and wood depends on your personal preference and the overall style of your living room.

**Sustainability and Eco-Friendliness:** Driftwood coffee tables are inherently sustainable, as they utilize reclaimed wood that would otherwise be discarded. By repurposing driftwood, these tables help reduce waste and minimize the environmental impact associated with traditional furniture production. Many manufacturers also employ eco-friendly finishes and construction methods, further enhancing the sustainability of their products.

 ## Core Benefits

The advantages of owning a driftwood coffee table extends beyond mere aesthetics. These unique tables are conversation starters and offer a blend of practicality and environmentally conscious design.

**Unique and Eye-Catching Design:** Driftwood coffee tables are inherently unique, as each piece of driftwood possesses its own distinct characteristics. This ensures that your coffee table will be a one-of-a-kind statement piece that adds character and personality to your living room. The natural beauty and organic shapes of the driftwood create a visually appealing focal point that draws attention and sparks conversation.

**Adds Natural Warmth and Texture:** The natural texture and warm tones of driftwood bring a sense of nature indoors, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere in your living room. The weathered look of the wood adds depth and dimension to your dÈóÅËÇ©ÂéßÂÆïÊä©r, complementing a variety of styles from coastal and rustic to modern and eclectic. Driftwood coffee tables help soften the hard lines of contemporary furniture and add a touch of organic charm to any space.

**Durable and Long-Lasting:** Despite its weathered appearance, driftwood is surprisingly durable and long-lasting, especially when properly treated and sealed. The wood has been naturally seasoned by the elements, making it resistant to rot, decay, and insect infestation. With proper care and maintenance, a driftwood coffee table can last for many years, providing a timeless and functional addition to your home.

**Environmentally Friendly Choice:** By choosing a driftwood coffee table, you're making an environmentally conscious decision to support sustainable practices and reduce waste. Reclaimed driftwood is a renewable resource that helps minimize the demand for newly harvested timber. This reduces deforestation and conserves natural habitats, making driftwood furniture a responsible and eco-friendly choice for your home.

**Versatile Style Integration:** While often associated with coastal or rustic dÈóÅËÇ©ÂéßÂÆïÊä©r, driftwood coffee tables can be surprisingly versatile and adaptable to a variety of interior styles. Their natural textures and neutral tones complement a wide range of color palettes and design elements. A driftwood coffee table can add a touch of warmth and character to a minimalist modern space, or enhance the cozy ambiance of a traditional living room.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common customer questions helps ensure you have the necessary information for a confident purchase.

**How do I clean and maintain a driftwood coffee table?**
  Regular dusting with a soft cloth is essential to prevent the build-up of dirt and debris. For spills, wipe them up immediately with a damp cloth and mild soap. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the finish and alter the wood's natural appearance. Applying a furniture polish or oil specifically designed for wood can help maintain its luster and protect it from moisture.

**Will the driftwood change over time?**
  Driftwood is a natural material and may exhibit subtle changes over time, such as slight variations in color or texture. This is a normal part of the aging process and adds to the character and uniqueness of the piece. To minimize any potential changes, avoid placing the table in direct sunlight or near sources of heat, as this can cause the wood to dry out or fade.

**Are driftwood coffee tables safe for children and pets?**
  Most driftwood coffee tables are treated with non-toxic sealants and finishes, making them safe for use in households with children and pets. However, it's essential to inspect the table regularly for any sharp edges or loose pieces of driftwood that could pose a hazard. Consider rounding off any sharp corners or edges with sandpaper or adding corner protectors for extra safety.

**What if my driftwood coffee table arrives damaged?**
  If your driftwood coffee table arrives damaged, contact the seller or manufacturer immediately to report the issue and request a replacement or refund. Be sure to document the damage with photos and provide a detailed description of the problem. Most reputable sellers will offer a prompt and satisfactory resolution to ensure your complete satisfaction.

  * **Dimensions:** 36"" Diameter x 17"" H

### Key Differences Summary
Driftwood Dreams offers a more authentic and natural look due to its genuine driftwood construction and glass top, while Coastal Charm provides a more traditional and rustic aesthetic with its solid wood top and distressed finish.

 ## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

When looking to acquire a driftwood coffee table, balance your desire for aesthetics with practical concerns about durability and maintenance.

When choosing a driftwood coffee table, consider the size and shape of your living room, the overall style of your dÈóÅËÇ©ÂéßÂÆïÊä©r, and your personal preferences.

1k3hn24,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1k3hn24/muscle_binding_seems_slow/,Muscle binding seems slow,"Ok here's my brief background. Had periods of my life from being quite skinny after high school to quite overweight (260lbs at 6'1 in my mid 20's) 

Anyway, around 30 I again lost a bunch of weight and was around 190. At 35 (march of 2021) I decided it was time to finally get that ripped body and joined a gym after a month or two of home workouts. Spent six months doing a lot of volume, light weight high rep stuff and dieting too much trying to get abs. I got all the way down to 151 pounds the summer of 2021. So I sorta wanted some newbie gains probably

Spent most of 2022 around 160-165, gained some weight in 2023 (maxing out around 178)

So now I've been bulking for a few months. Training quite hard and eating a lot. Been steady around 172 for a couple months cuz I still do a lot of walking, I play basketball, and do dedicated cardio sessions (I'm talking like 45-60 minutes) a few times a month.

And well, I definitely see development in my back, and my arms look big with a pump, but overall I just feel like I haven't ever come close to maxing out my potential. My dad is also skinny, so maybe it's genetics, maybes it's just slow growth cuz I'll be 40 next year. Maybe I'm still not doing something right despite pushing myself hard, both with weights and cardio. I can't imagine I'm not doing enough volume, as I do 6 sets per muscle (2 different exercises, 3 sets each) and push to failure often. Lately I've decided to do one warmup set, one hard set, and one really hard set rather than multiple really hard ones.

My rear delts look awesome, my back looks cut, but my arms and calf's are still skinny. I also enjoy bodyweight dips and pull ups, so maybe I don't choose the best movements for growth either, although most of my stuff is with machines or dumbbells 

My grip is awesome, my mobility decent, and my cardio excellent, which I want because longevity is more important to me than muscles. But more muscle would be nice. Idk what to do if I'm constantly in a surplus, training push pull legs 6-7 times a month. I could cut back in cardio some but I allay eat enough to recover.

Like even with several years of weight training, to a person who doesn't go to the gym I probably look pretty average, and even still skinny to some people

So yeah, just throwing this out into the universe to see what I get back.

Also I only take creatine and sometimes protein powder as supplements. I do drink high protein coffee and eat high protein cereal if that counts too. I easily get 180g plus per day, and I always eat 3 very healthy meals, many fruits and veggies, beans, fish, chicken, etc

I can't imagine what else I could do to actually put on noticeable mass.",1,1745135950.0,beginnerfitness,2,1.0,False

It was a family trip but I have mostly explored some spots alone. 


Happy to answer any questions


- point of entry was SFO flown via United Airlines

- only two questions asked upon arriving SFO (where will I be staying and how much cash I have) I only had $200 with me but I brought 4 CCs. Don‚Äôt bring HSBC rate is bad

- I have purchased esim using Tello for $20 then top up lang pag naubusan ng data


San Francisco

- There are trains sa San Francisco area pero still layo layo pa rin ang tourist spot

-I tried purchasing clipper card but dont know how to get a QR sa phone . I have not successfully used Apple Pay while in the US. If anyone knows a trick LMK 

- Usually nagpapahatid ako sa relatives or Uber. Uber is quite expensive pero reliable naman. 

-Medyo nakaka stress transpo sa SF kaya nag Uber na lang ako mostly


LA
- Then flew from SFO to LAX (6hrs drive kasi while flying is around 1hr lang)

- then we rented a car in LAX thru AVIS

- hindi rin reliable ang public transpo sa LA unless siguro if you are staying at the center
- I was not able to tour around LA except Rodeo Drive due to a lot of traffic. Like heavy traffic
- I have used my PH driver‚Äôs license to drive. 

-parking is very expensive like $3-7 per 15mins or $18-$25 whole day and mahirap din humanap ng parking. 

Next time, I suggest mag hop on hop off bus tour na lang from Klook. 
Meal costs $10-$30 pero huge servings naman
Coffee $7

NYC
- flight costs $200 per pax RT from SFO

- I was not able to try the parang beep card for the subway, I have used my credit card which I think is not a great idea if you will be using the subway a lot. 170 pesos per tap charge sa CC ko

- meal costs $10-$30 rin

- masarap yung mga food truck na halal food sa mga gilid gilid just for $10 sulit na malaki servings

-sobrang laki ng Central Park, you may need to a lot half a day to explore

- may mga parang pedicab na nagoffer ng ride pero super expensive. I just tried it for like $50 for half an hour (natawaran ko sya from $100)

-mabaho and madumi yung subway, may rats and poop sa stairs parang need mo magpaligo sa alcohol every time

- pricey and souvenir shirts sa Time Square around $15-25 ang isa

- if bibili ka ng souvenirs, I recommend to buy instead sa Chinatown mas mura ang shirts pwedeng tumawad

- I rode the subway ng gabi alone, buhay pa naman sko, just be careful lang and sumabay sa ibang tao

DC

- rode Amtrak from NYC to DC nasa $100-$200 around 2.5hrs-3hrs yung travel time

- I explored the Holocaust Museum, White House, Washington Monument and Capitol
- nag uber lang din ako go around

- safe and clean sa DC masarap maglakad


- I highly recommend Purple Patch resto - Filipino owned sobrang sarap ng food",2,1745135914.0,phtravel,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been down the rabbit hole of trying to find the **most effective teeth whitening method**, testing everything from whitening strips to professional treatments. Some worked, some were a waste of time, and some left my teeth **achingly sensitive**.

So, if you‚Äôre wondering **what actually works**, here‚Äôs a breakdown of all the major teeth whitening methods‚Äî**what‚Äôs effective, what‚Äôs a waste of money, and what I‚Äôd actually recommend**.

# Common Teeth Whitening Methods (Ranked Best to Worst)

After testing different methods, I‚Äôve put together a ranking based on **effectiveness, speed, safety, and cost**.

# 1. Professional Whitening at the Dentist (Most Powerful, But Expensive)

* Uses **high-concentration peroxide gel + UV or LED light** for fast results.
* Whitens **up to 8 shades in one session**.
* **Downside:** Costs anywhere from **$300 to $600 per session**.

# 2. LED Whitening Kits (Best At-Home Option)

* Uses **hydrogen peroxide gel + LED light** to activate the whitening process.
* Similar results to professional whitening but at a fraction of the price.
* **Best option I tried:** **Laughland teeth whitening** ‚Äì fast results, no sensitivity.
* Took me from **coffee-stained to 6-7 shades whiter in a week**.

Check out how LED whitening works [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# 3. Whitening Strips (Decent, But Slow & Can Cause Sensitivity)

* Works over 2-3 weeks but **uneven results + increased tooth sensitivity**.
* Can only **remove surface stains**, not deep discoloration.

# 4. Whitening Toothpaste (Better for Maintenance, Not Deep Whitening)

* Helps prevent stains but **doesn‚Äôt actually whiten teeth much**.
* Works best for **maintaining results after a whitening treatment**.

# 5. DIY Home Remedies (Mostly Ineffective & Can Damage Teeth)

üö´ **Charcoal toothpaste** ‚Äì Looks cool, but **too abrasive** and damages enamel over time.  
üö´ **Baking soda & lemon** ‚Äì Acidic and **erodes enamel**, making teeth **more yellow** over time.  
üö´ **Hydrogen peroxide rinses** ‚Äì Might work in theory but can **burn gums** if used too often.

# My Results Using Laughland LED Whitening

Since **professional whitening was out of my budget**, I tried **Laughland teeth whitening** to see if LED whitening really worked.

Here‚Äôs what happened over **7 days**:

* **Day 1:** No change yet, but the LED mouthpiece was easy to use.
* **Day 3:** Coffee stains around my teeth started fading.
* **Day 5:** Teeth looked noticeably **brighter and more even**.
* **Day 7:** My teeth were **6-7 shades whiter**, and the best part‚Äî**zero sensitivity**.

Most other whitening products I‚Äôve tried left my teeth feeling **super sensitive**‚Äîbut with Laughland, I had **no pain or gum irritation**.

# Final Verdict: What‚Äôs the Most Effective Teeth Whitening Method?

‚úî **Best overall:** Professional whitening (but expensive).  
‚úî **Best at-home method:** **LED whitening kits like Laughland** (effective & affordable).  
‚úî **Best for maintenance:** Whitening toothpaste & avoiding staining foods/drinks.

If you‚Äôre looking for **fast results without breaking the bank**, **LED whitening is definitely the way to go**. Have you tried teeth whitening before? What worked best (or worst) for you? Let‚Äôs discuss!",1,1745135489.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

This is the Armagh GAA star due in court accused of committing a sex attack while on a trip to the US with the team to celebrate their All-Ireland win.

Forward and former captain Aidan Nugent has been charged with two counts of sexual assault and two counts of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.

The alleged offences, which Nugent strenuously denies, are said to have been committed while members of the team, family members and senior county GAA figures were on holiday in the Florida city of Miami last November.

Nugent declined to discuss the case with Sunday Life

Armagh claimed their second ever All-Ireland win last summer with a 1-11 to 0-13 victory over Galway which went down to the wire at Croke Park.

Nugent was on the substitutes bench for the match but did not play in the game.

The 30-year-old is due to appear before Armagh Magistrates Court on May 6.

Sunday Life called to Nugent‚Äôs home outside the Armagh village of Newtownhamilton last week but was told by a woman who answered the door he did not wish to discuss the case.

When this newspaper contacted Nugent by phone he hung up.

The accused owns a gym called R8 ‚Äî Cardio and Coffee in Armagh city, but customers have said he had not been seen there recently.

He was also was part of the St Patrick‚Äôs, Cullyhanna, team which won the All-Ireland intermediate title at Croke Park in January last year.

After the win, Nugent spoke of how much the victory meant to people in Armagh as a whole.

‚ÄúEven outside of Cullyhanna, you were talking to people who‚Äôd lost loved ones over Christmas that are from Armagh and they‚Äôve told us that the football has given them a massive lift,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSo, it makes you think what it‚Äôs done for Cullyhanna people who‚Äôve lost loved ones.‚Äù

Nugent is alleged to have committed the attack in Miami

A qualified teacher, Nugent was educated at St Paul‚Äôs High School in Bessbrook before going on to study at St Mary‚Äôs University College in Belfast.

Following the announcement of Nugent being charged, his solicitor said: ‚ÄúI am shocked by the decision of the PSNI to charge my client in relation to an incident that occurred outside the jurisdiction last year.

‚ÄúI believe there was no necessity to arrest my client.

‚ÄúA formal complaint was made to the PSNI on November 20, 2024. No contact was made between the PSNI and my client for three weeks.

‚ÄúWhen requested, he presented himself voluntarily at Banbridge Police station where he was arrested over four months ago.

‚ÄúThe request by the PSNI to charge, I believe, is without merit and shall be challenged further down the line.

‚ÄúI believe the decision to charge the suspect to court by the PSNI is influenced by the media publicity this case has attracted due to his profession and in breach of my client‚Äôs right to a fair trial and in breach of his right to private and family rights.

‚ÄúMy client maintains his innocent and has instructed me to contest the charges fully.‚Äù

A police spokesperson said last week: ‚ÄúA 30-year-old man was arrested on December 10, 2024, on suspicion of a number of sexual-related offences alleged to have taken place in the United States of America in November 2024.

‚ÄúHe was later released on bail to allow for further enquiries to be carried out.‚Äù

They added: ‚ÄúAs is normal procedure, all charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service, and police will not be commenting further as criminal justice proceedings progress.‚Äù",7,1745135450.0,northernireland,0,0.77,False

I was getting ready for work (I work from home), turned on my PC, and started getting my coffee ready.  After logging in, everything seemed normal, but I did notice a youtube video I was watching was a bit sluggish.  I didn't really think much of it, and got up to get my coffee.

I came back and shortly after I sat back down, the computer had a BSOD.  I believe the error was CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED, but I was not able to get a screenshot in time.

Then, after the reboot, the PC went straight to BIOS.  I tried to restart a few different times, then turned the PC off, and then remembered having an issue like this previously.  It was the graphics card back then, so I tried to reseat my graphics card, and still was getting the same error.  I then remembered another issue I had with an issue like this and it was as simple as resetting the CMOS battery. So, probably stupidly, I went nuclear and reset the CMOS battery.  

Now the PC won't POST.  Both the red and yellow light on the motherboard for CPU and DRAM respectively stay on.  Seems to be a bricked at the moment.  Any ideas on what I can do?  I can reinstall windows if I have to.  I also have a USB with a fairly recent BIOS from when I installed my chip a month or so ago.

They say once you‚Äôve been burned, you never hold the match the same way again. But what if I want to light the whole damn candle, scented, over-priced, and wrapped in pastel packaging like it belongs in a Pinterest board titled ‚ÄúLove is in the Air (and on Sale)‚Äù?

See, I want to fall in love again. Like really fall.
Not the careful kind. Not the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep one foot on the ground just in case he‚Äôs another walking red flag in disguise‚Äù kind. I want the kind of fall that makes rom-com soundtracks make sense. The kind that makes me want to do the whole slow-dance-in-the-kitchen, kiss-me-in-the-rain, run-through-NAIA-arrivals-without-shame level of love.

I used to be that person. The hopeless romantic who cried during Notting Hill, recited One Day like scripture, and believed love would show up in the most inconvenient yet cinematic way‚Äîprobably while I‚Äôm holding too many iced coffees and looking vaguely lost.

But somewhere between ghostings, almosts, and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not ready‚Äùs, I started putting little locks on my heart. Not padlocks‚Äîthose are dramatic. More like the quiet click of someone who‚Äôs been left on read one too many times.

Still‚Ä¶ I miss her.
The girl in me who believed love was just around the corner and probably wearing something tailored. The one who believed in spark, in serendipity, in someone choosing you back, fully, with both hands.

I want her back.

I want to fall in love again. Delulu and all. Because if I can watch a K-drama and root for two people who literally met because one tripped in a convenience store, surely there‚Äôs hope for me too?

So here‚Äôs to love. To loving like we‚Äôve never been ghosted. To romanticizing a walk to 7-Eleven if it means maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîsomeone will walk beside us and pick the same Slurpee flavor.

Because even when the world tells us to chill, to wait, to lower expectations‚Ä¶
Some of us will always believe love should feel like a plot twist in the final chapter of our favorite chick flick.

And honestly? I think that‚Äôs kind of fabulous.

XOXO,
Still Holding Out for My Meet-Cute

It put me into a large sum of debt, about 10k. Now 9 months later I am in a program to get out of debt but it‚Äôll take 3 years, and I am renting to own my trailer with 2 years left on it. I am paycheck to paycheck, with so little in between that my food has only been rice with chicken for one meal a day, and at a fork in the road trying to see what to do for my career. Leaving me with no real room to make a savings. 

My family followed close behind moving a month after I did and now live in an RV on some relatives land in our hometown. 

Yesterday my best friends and I went out for coffee, it turned into looking at some modular homes. One friend has a kid on the way so is out growing her home, and the other two are a couple trying to get out of a parent‚Äôs house. We were there primarily for the couple. 

The whole deal, it sent me into a spiral. My home isn‚Äôt bad, great for a single person. But I‚Äôm awake at 1:30 am cause the police are hunting for some guy. A few months ago there was murder down a few trailers. 
Renting to own is nice but the trailer is too old to move per some city bs. 

The rough plan I formed is to get a second job on the weekend seeing if I can bag another 16 hours, with my full time job being a 9-5 on the week days. The second jobs pay would all go into debt program to end it early by getting it down to only a year. Then it would go to my rent so I can pay my trailer off and own it. That would take 6 months, leaving me at a year and a half to be to the point that I could drop the second job, and build savings with my full time job for a down payment. Once I have enough I‚Äôd  give my place to my family getting them out of an RV. While having them pay me so they could own the trailer.

when it arrived, it fit perfectly on my pinkie.
i posted a picture on reddit and twitter to brag‚Äî thanks, whoever you are! i couldn't help but grin, getting my foot and face in the frame. 

i felt so beautiful.

day after day, i would remove it before i got in the shower and wash it. it was on my dirty toes after all. then, i would set in the pile of jewelry i had been wearing that way. it would all go back to its place soon.

 yet after every shower, the toe ring seemed to speak to me...

'*wear me...*' 

i was drawn to it. it went back, perfectly on my pinkie toe every time.

one day, as i was smiling at my coffee paid for by some cuck not even important enough to mention here lol, i got two more throne notifications.

a bracelet and a bird plushie.

no identification, no nothing. a selfless gift. 

i felt so excited, the tears welled up in my eyes. although i'm naturally dominant, i'm still somewhat of a crybaby. it touches me that someone sees what a goddess i truly am and gives without asking in return. i've had so many negative experiences in my life where men have ruthlessly taken from me, and i have grown so far from then. being dominant has taught me to respect myself and know my worth. silent sends remind me to hold my boundaries. they keep me grounded in all affairs, in and out of kink. 

my chest was all light, and i felt dizzy with power. i scrunched my toe ring up against the ball of my foot, and it shocked my whole body with a bolt of white, hot lust. 

the toe ring possesed me, and i began to touch myself. 

touch myself as in *touch* myself. in every which way. it didn't matter how i was touching me, just that i was and it felt so, so sweet. i rubbed the balls of my sore, aching feet together. i madsaged my swollen breasts. i rubbed my curious pinky toe on the fat of my thigh, then squished the soft under my soles. 

i howled in pleasure. 

my toe reached towards my labia and stretched to play with my fat, throbbing clit... 
this new ease of flexibility should have been a warning.

i was naive.

sticking my toe in my pussy, i  thrust furiously over and over. my tight, dripping-wet, gorilla grip hole gave the toe a stunning blueprint of my dazzling vagina.

i was so exhausted and lost in the pleasure, i just fell asleep...

little did i know that night, in the form of a dream, i would first meet the silent send wizard.

1k3hbom,https://i.redd.it/dwrfk9moexve1.jpeg,Could this make Portugal a longer-lasting superpower and influence Europe?,"The island was originally part of the mainland before an earthquake and plate rift 40,000 years ago separated the island from the mainland.

The island has been influenced by the general history of the peninsula. The first people to settle here were Iberians. The Romans attempted to colonize the island, but they did not last long.

Until the time of King Afonso I of Portugal, he was the first to conquer the entire island, making it a Portuguese territory.

Hundreds of years passed, until when Portugal became part of the Iberian Union, the island declared independence as a new Portugal, independent of Spain. Spain sent several armies to attack it, but they were unsuccessful.

During the Portuguese Restoration War (1640‚Äì1668), the island supported King John IV of Portugal in restoring its independence.During the reign of King John V of Portugal, more people began to immigrate to the island, which led to the construction of many Christian churches.

The later history of the island is exactly the same as that of Portugal, except that during the Ghost War, Spain occupied the northern part of the island and Napoleon Bonaparte was able to occupy it.

Additional information: This island can grow crops such as bananas, sugarcane, coffee, and cocoa.

Seeking advice,"I have recently split up with my ex gf (~1 year relationship) due to a variety of reasons I won‚Äôt get too much into. However, it was on good terms and when I‚Äôm asked about it I still have a lot of respect for her and say good things about her. After splitting up with my ex, I attended a work function where another girl about 2 years younger than me was heavily flirty and giving major signs. These included touching her leg on mine under the table, catching her staring at me, filling my water for me over the night etc‚Ä¶. After this, I texted her over social media and said that I really enjoyed hanging with her that night and that we should go out for a coffee sometime. She agreed and tried to schedule a couple of days from that night. We had a fairly big conversation over the phone talking about her crush on me for a while and her reluctance to share our date to people at work as she didn‚Äôt want to deal with the drama. As I was extremely busy with engineering at university and her being busy with uni as well, we eventually scheduled the date two weeks from the time of her agreeing to go on a date. In the first week after, it was very flirty over the phone, her sending a lot of picture of her (not explicit). Additionally, I had to pick something up from work and she texted and said I should come and pick it up. She approached my car and the flirting was great (teasing each other, getting close to each other etc). That weekend, I messaged her and asked if a certain location was good for the date at a specific time and she did not open the message for three days. I did not double text or chase. Eventually, she texted and said that she wasn‚Äôt overly comfortable with how long it had been since my breakup (which I admit is a valid reason and don‚Äôt blame her at all). She also said she would like to potentially do something down the track if ‚Äúwe were both still feeling it‚Äù. I replied by something along the lines of ‚Äútotally get it, take your time, appreciate the honesty :)‚Äù and she hearted my message and left it at that. It‚Äôs been about 10 days since and I have had no contact with her. 

I have had a few girlfriends in the past and am quite confident with women. I do really like this girl and would like to see something progress here, but I‚Äôm also smart enough to read between the lines and recognise that maybe she‚Äôs not feeling it on her end. Mind you, when she initially said yes to the date she said she only had a ‚Äúsmidge‚Äù of an issue with the timing with last relationship. What is the best course of action here from your perspective? (especially a woman‚Äôs pov :)). Currently I am very busy with study and gym (final year of engineering) and am very focused so I have not initiated contact again. Is this a bad move?

I've been struggling for months. I've been trying to manifest the return and rebuilding of my relationship with SP for months.

Damn, the 3D has a conscience of its own because it knows how to not only hurt me but kill me inside. She had told me about a 3P the only time I was able to manifest her and that destroyed me. I tried to push it away and it didn't work either. It hurt so much that I stopped reading Neville despite reading four books.

SATS, normal affirmations, robotic affirmations almost the entire day, scripting, the whisper method, trying to have the desire state fulfilled and nothing, even in another post ""Use Your Affirmation Carefully While Manifesting SP."" Talking to an OP, he told me, just don't show it anymore, detach yourself, and when you no longer want anything and don't obsess, you'll have everything. That's what I did, and I took a week off all kinds of techniques or SATs, and this Thursday the 17th, she sent me a video where she implied that despite everything she still loves me. While we were talking, she told me she's having a lot of problems at home, at her university... and finally, with 3P, she's afraid she's pregnant, because despite having an IUD or coil, it seems like weeks without a period.

The conversation ended with other things, but I was already feeling indifferent, disgusted even. She didn't contact me after that, nor did she respond to my last message from that day, and I've just been crying like an idiot... what the fuck is going on with 3D? It seems like a damn demonic entity with a conscience, a demiurge; damn this destroyed me so much. She was my precious pearl, I loved her so much, but with this... what's the point of having her back? What's the point of trusting the law if I can't defend myself with such shit in 3D? If I can't? To have what I most desire in this world. Even the little self-concept I'd been working on for weeks has gone to hell.

### Discovering the Heart of Icelandic Flavors

When you visit Iceland, indulging in the local cuisine is an essential part of your experience. Icelandic food offers a unique blend of fresh, natural ingredients and traditional preparation methods. To truly enjoy authentic Icelandic cuisine, it‚Äôs important to know where to find the best dishes and what to expect from this island nation‚Äôs culinary scene.

### Where to Savor Genuine Icelandic Meals

In Reykjav√≠k, the capital city, you will find a rich selection of restaurants, caf√©s, and street food vendors serving authentic Icelandic dishes. For a genuine taste, seek out establishments known for sourcing local ingredients and respecting heritage recipes. Look for small eateries and family-owned restaurants, which often provide the most heartfelt and traditional meals.

Outside the city, many rural guesthouses and farm-to-table restaurants offer fresh, homemade Icelandic fare. These places highlight seasonal ingredients, such as lamb, fish, and wild berries.

### Understanding Icelandic Ingredients and Flavors

The Icelandic diet is heavily based on seafood, lamb, and dairy. These staples come from a country where farming and fishing are integral to everyday life. Expect fresh or smoked fish like cod, haddock, and Arctic char to feature prominently on menus. Lamb, often grass-fed and free-range, is tender and rich in flavor. Dairy products like skyr ‚Äì a thick, yogurt-like delicacy ‚Äì are popular snacks and dessert ingredients.

One distinctive feature of Icelandic food is its subtle, natural taste. Chefs tend to avoid heavy seasoning and instead rely on the inherent flavors of fresh ingredients. This approach might seem mild compared to more spice-heavy cuisines, but it‚Äôs refreshing and genuine.

### Sampling Traditional Icelandic Dishes

When trying authentic dishes, it helps to know the names and what makes them special. Here are some examples you should look out for:

- **Plokkfiskur:** A comforting fish stew made with boiled cod or haddock, mashed potatoes, onions, and creamy sauce.
- **Kj√∂ts√∫pa:** Traditional Icelandic lamb soup, filled with root vegetables and tender meat, perfect for warming up after outdoor adventures.
- **Skyr:** A protein-rich dairy product enjoyed plain or with fruits and honey ‚Äì often eaten like yogurt.
- **Har√∞fiskur:** Dried fish that's chewy and salty, commonly eaten as a snack with butter.
- **R√∫gbrau√∞:** Dense rye bread, traditionally baked by burying it in geothermal ground for slow cooking.
 
Trying these dishes will deepen your appreciation for Iceland‚Äôs food culture.

### What to Keep in Mind When Dining in Iceland

Iceland‚Äôs food scene respects tradition but also embraces innovation. Many restaurants fuse Icelandic ingredients with modern cooking techniques to create creative dishes. Don‚Äôt hesitate to ask your server for dish recommendations or for explanations about ingredients. Icelanders are proud of their cuisine and usually happy to share stories behind their food.

Prices can be higher than what you might be used to, reflecting the country‚Äôs remote location and the effort needed to source fresh, sustainable foods. Planning your meals ahead and choosing a mix of fine dining and casual eateries can help balance your budget.

#### Tips for Enjoying Your Meal

- Try seasonal and locally caught seafood, as it‚Äôs often at its freshest and best.
- Be adventurous and sample dishes like fermented shark (h√°karl) if you want a true Icelandic challenge.
- Pair meals with Icelandic brews, such as craft beers or Brenniv√≠n, a traditional schnapps sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúBlack Death.‚Äù
- Enjoy the atmosphere ‚Äì Icelandic meals are more than just food; they are social events that connect you to the culture.
 
### The Unique Joy of Icelandic Dining

Whether you dine in a city restaurant with a view of the harbor or at a countryside farm, you‚Äôll find dishes that tell stories of endurance, resourcefulness, and pride.

1k3h7nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k3h7nt/the_infestation_of_pikes_head_cove_alaska_part_1/,"The Infestation of Pike's Head Cove, Alaska (Part 1)","After the Army, I felt lost, unsure of what to do with myself or my life. I had joined up at the ripe age of 18, spending most of my illustrious 10-year career and my 3 tours in Afghanistan as a Military Working Dog Handler. After we pulled out of Afghanistan, however, with my current contract coming to an end, I felt that my time had come to move on, that I had done my part, but I just didn't know what it was I was supposed to be moving on to.



So, I drifted. With no real family or home to go back to, I bought a van and hit the road, saw the country. 



I bought a Belgian Malinois pup as well, which I named Rowdy, from an ex-military guy I knew. He had also worked as a Dog Handler, and now specifically bred and trained working dogs for people who wanted the real deal. 



Over the course of the next several months, Rowdy and I went on many great adventures together. We saw the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. We camped out in Tahoe, Yellowstone, and Yosemite. All the while, our bond growing, as did Rowdy himself, and my extensive training with him paid off as he grew into a model working dog, and my best friend.



It wasn't long, however, until our traveling adventures began digging deep into my savings, and I knew we would have to settle down someplace soon before I went broke. So, that's when we made our way to Alaska. I had always pictured myself settling down there, in the last frontier, but didn't exactly know where, or what I would do for work.



We again drifted for a time, but this time, in the confines of the state, with the express goal of finding our new home. And eventually, we did just that.



The coastal town of Pike's Head Cove was perhaps the smallest I'd ever been to, with only a population of 182 people at the time of our arrival. There was only 3 ways in or out of the town, North and South tunnels carved through the mountains that bordered it, and by sea travel. It had one market, one mechanic's shop, one 24 hour diner that also served as the town bar or a place to rent a room for the night if the misses locked you out after a bender, and practically nothing else, as their economy completely consisted off the fishing trade.



You see, the town received its name for two reasons. One, that from an aerial view, the shape of the town and the cove it had developed around resembled the head of an open mouthed Pike. Two, that the cove itself and the section of the Arctic Sea beyond were mysteriously filled with a seemingly endless supply of Northern Pike.



Upon arriving in this town, I completely fell in love. I loved the quiet seclusion of it, the hardworking and welcoming nature of its people, and the cold sea that bordered it. So, I decided to make it my home.



I found a small house to rent. It had been left unoccupied for the better part of 2 years, as I had been the first person to move into town in that long.



Then, one night, I managed to corral the local fishing Captain of a vessel named the Helmsman, Captain Burke, a burly and grey bearded man, for drinks at the town diner, The Cove's Respite. 



We talked some about my military service and his, he was ex-Navy, and I emphasized throughout the night my passion for fishing, and how I was looking for work. This was mostly true, as I was an avid fisherman, even having been deep sea fishing a handful of times in my life, although I had no work experience in the field.



Several whiskeys into the night, Captain Burke finally relented, offering me a spot aboard his crew, under the condition that I prove myself capable of handling the job over a short trial period. I had to assume he had only done so given the fact that I was a military man, but work in town had been secured for me regardless.



That was also the night that I met Rachel. She was a beautiful brown haired woman in her late twenties that worked as a waitress, bartender, dish washer, basically whatever was needed of her at The Cove's Respite.



Upon seeing the banter and looks the two of us had been sharing over the course of the night, Captain Burke assured me that she was single, and that I should ask her out. 



So, I did.  



The next few months passed by in a breeze. I proved myself, through trial and error, among the crew of the Helmsman, and Captain Burke assured me a more permanent position within its ranks. My relationship with Rachel developed quickly, though maturely, and it looked as though it could be one that went the distance. I even began decorating my home and settling in, something I had never really had the chance to do before in my adult life.



Everything was going smooth as could be, until one day, aboard the Helmsman, I reeled in a Pike, only to drop it in horror at the sight of what was inside its open mouth. Where the Pike's tongue should have been, a white bug-like creature wriggled around in its place, staring back at me with tiny beady black eyes. 



""What the shit is that!?"" I exclaimed, pointing to the sickly thin looking Pike that wriggled about on the floor before me.



Captain Burke took notice and stomped over, grabbing ahold of the fish by the base of its head with one meaty paw of a hand and lifting it to eye level. ""A Fish Louse,"" he said matter of fact like with a curt nod.



""Fish Louse?"" I asked.



""Forget their scientific name,"" Burke continued. ""But they're Isopods, they replace the fish's tongue and live inside their mouth, stealing their food. They're pretty common around the cove for some reason. When I first discovered them out here, I looked into it online, and it said they prefer warm coastal waters along California and Mexico and such, so I don't know why they're out here in the Arctic, or how the hell they're surviving, let alone thriving like they are. It's not really a big deal though, they're harmless to humans, so we just cut the heads off the infected fish and sell them at the market regardless."" 



""So,"" Kajak, a middle-aged Inuit man with black hair pulled back into a bun and thin strands of greying facial hair lining his lips and jaw chimed in as he unhooked a Pike of his own. ""The Landlubber finally catches a Tongue Stealer.""



""I guess so,"" I said. ""Fucking creepy.""



Burke stomped over to a cutting board he already had prepared for the day, smacked the wriggling Pike down onto it, lifted up a big meat cleaver, and hacked down, severing its head in one blow. A stream of blood poured out from the Pike's open neck, soon to be washed back into the ocean from sea water that periodically splashed aboard.



A quiet yet echoing scream sounded off in the distance, over the foggy sea, and I turned my gaze out to find it.



""They always scream whenever he beheads one of their kin,"" Kajak said. ""It's a bad omen.""



I looked to him with concern, and then back to Burke as he tossed the head of the pike and the Isopod that lived within back into the sea before dropping the rest of the fish into a huge ice chest. ""Will you quit scaring the boy with your superstitions?"" Burke said. ""Green Gill,"" he called me, a fun little nickname for the newest member of the crew. ""Get back to work, you're burning daylight.""



""Right,"" I moved back to the edge of the Helmsman, reset my rod and lure, and then cast back into the gently waving cool blue of the Arctic Sea just outside of Pike's Head Cove.



""Oh shit,"" Arturo called out from his fishing spot aboard the Helmsman, the last Green Gill before I came aboard. ""I caught one too!""



I turned back as my line bobbed above the water, watching as Captain Burke made his way over and took the wriggling pike from the stocky Hispanic man. 



""Two in one day,"" Burke said as he stomped over to the still blood and sea water coated cutting board, smacking this fish down upon it just as he had the last. ""That's rare."" He hefted up the meat cleaver and whacked down, chopping off the Pike's head again in one mighty blow.



Another distant scream sounded out across the waves, and I looked to Kajak, meeting his gaze. ""I told you,"" was he all he said, causing a chill to run down my spine.



It wasn't just 2 Louse infested fish we had caught that day before making our way back to land, but 7, a new record according to the rest of the crew. And every single time Burke beheaded one of them, a distant scream sounded out across the sea, and Kajak would meet my gaze with concern.



As I made my way down the dock to reenter the town proper, I pulled out my walkie talkie to call Rachel. Cell service was non existent in Pike's Head Cove, so walkie's were a necessity if you wanted to have communication across town on the go, and for the most part, people respected each other's private channels and knew better than to listen in or talk on a channel that was designated for someone else. Ours was channel 14.



""Landlubber to Sexy Barmaid,"" I said into my walkie as I pressed the talk button. ""Come in, Sexy Barmaid, over.""



I let go of the talk button, and seconds later, Rachel's chuckle sounded out from the walkie. ""Will you stop it with the codenames already?""



""Negative, Sexy Barmaid,"" I responded. ""Landlubber has made shore, what's your ETA?""



""Well, I just got off work, and I still have to swing by the market to grab some fish and a few other things to make dinner. So I'd say, about an hour from now?""



Her mention of fish forced the terrifying little face of the tongue stealing Louse back into my mind, and I felt my guts roil at the thought of eating anything that could have possibly been infested by one of those creatures. ""On second thought,"" I said. ""Skip the fish for tonight. Let's do something else for dinner.""



""Everything but fish is too damn expensive right now, you know that,"" Rachel replied, and she was right. The market could sell fish for cheap, as it was caught and supplied daily by us fisherman, but practically everything else had to be delivered from out of town. That, combined with Alaska's already steep prices on groceries, because of how hard it was to farm or raise livestock here, made most things at the market far out of our price range. ""Besides, I don't really trust the frozen beef they sell. I feel like Marta sells it long past its expiration date, but just doesn't care since it's frozen.""



""Look,"" I said. ""Just get anything you want, anything that looks good, and I'll pay you back when you get to my place, just remind me. But please, no fish for tonight, just trust me.""



""Alright, if you're buying,"" Rachel said mischievously, as if she would go overboard shopping, even though I knew she wasn't the type of person to do such a thing. 



Arturo made his way down the dock then behind me, stopping momentarily to light up a cigarette.



Burke and Kajak closed in behind him, dragging carts behind them with ice chests filled with our daily catches resting atop them.



I realized then that I didn't actually have any cash on hand to pay her back with, and that the town bank would be closed for the night by now. ""I gotta go, Sexy Barmaid,"" I said. ""See you soon.""



""Aye Aye, Landlubber!"" She called back in a pirate accent before signing off.



I smiled at that, and then stuffed my walkie into one of the hand pockets of my big thermal coat. ""Hey, Cap'n!"" I called out as I jogged back over to my crewmates.



""Yes?"" Burke said as he came to a halt.



""Anyway I can get paid in advance for today?"" I asked. ""It's date night, but I don't have any cash to pay for dinner.""



Burke sighed, reaching around behind himself to retrieve his wallet from his back pocket. ""Yeah, I suppose so."" He reached into the thick stack of cash that rested within, pulling out 6 twenties and handing them over to me.



""Thanks, Cap'n,"" I said with a smile. ""You're the best.""



""Yeah, I know it,"" he said as Kajak came to a stop and held out his hand without saying a word. Burke sighed, and pulled out 8 twenties to give to him, and before the other man could even ask, pulled out another 7 to give to Arturo, nearly cleaning out his entire wallet, the other men of course getting paid more than myself as they had worked aboard the Helmsman for longer. ""Everyone happy now?"" Burke asked with exasperation before picking back up the handle to his fish hauling wagon.



Everyone nodded and smiled in agreement, like we were all children convincing our father to pay us allowance that would secretly be spent on bud and booze.



Kajak pulled out a wooden pipe then, its bowl already prefilled with a blend of tobacco and weed. He sparked a match and lit the whole bowl, taking several quick puffs from it to get the ember nice and ripe. ""Arturo, my friend,"" he said between puffs and exhales. ""You mind taking the haul to market with the Captain for me today? I also have a date night with the misses."" 



Arturo shook his head between drags of his cigarette. ""No, not at all,"" he said as he took up the handle of Kajak's fish cart for him and began following after the Captain.

  
Kajak caught him before he got too far away, offering him one of the twenties he had just received from Captain Burke, as bringing the fish to market with the Captain was part of Kajak's job and part of the reason why he got paid more that Arturo. So, it was only fair that Arturo received the extra pay for today, as Kajak was a man of principal.



""See you men bright and early on Monday!"" Captain Burke called back as he made his way in the direction of the town market, Arturo following closely behind him now. We worked a 6 day work week, having Sundays off, and today happened to be Saturday.



""Enjoy your weekend, Cap'n!"" I called back after him.



Kajak stayed standing on the dock, puffing from his pipe.



""Well, have a good weekend,"" I said, ready to head home to see Rowdy and wait for Rachel.



Kajak nodded, but didn't say anything as he continued sucking on his pipe.



I started away, when he spoke up from behind me. ""Landlubber,"" he said, calling my attention back to him.



""Yeah,"" I responded. ""What's up?""



""Be careful, and stay calm,"" he said. ""I'm worried about you. I see omens and portents more often around you. Been seeing you in my dreams.""



Coming from anyone else, this revelation may have creeped me out, but something about Kajak radiated a foreign wisdom from a culture I wasn't a part of, like he knew something that I couldn't possibly know, and that I should listen to his warnings and words of advice. ""What sort of dreams?"" Was all I could think to ask in the moment.



Kajak seemed to consider sharing his dreams with me, but then thought better of it, waving the prospect away with a shake of his head and swipe of his hand through the air. ""Go about you way, Tyler,"" he called me by my name for perhaps the first time since I'd met him. ""Just don't forget to listen when the world speaks to you. You're more perceptive to hearing her voice than most Landlubbers.""



I nodded. ""I won't forget,"" I said as I turned to leave, and I genuinely meant it. ""Goodnight, Kajak.""



""Goodnight, little brother,"" he said back as he also turned away, heading for his pickup truck, still puffing on his pipe as he went.



I hurried home then, greeting an excited Rowdy at the door and taking a quick shower before Rachel could get there.



When she arrived, I opened the front door to see her standing there, holding up a boxed frozen pizza in one hand with a wide grin. ""Looks like $20 freezer burnt pizza for dinner,"" she said, just managing to contain her laughter. ""Are you as excited as I am?"" 



""Oh,"" I replied in exaggeration. ""You have no idea."" I grabbed her then, pulling her inside into my warm embrace and greeting her with a kiss. ""I missed you,"" I said as I pulled back and looked into her piercing green eyes.



""I missed you, too,"" she replied, a bit of a blush taking over her cheeks before she leaned in for another kiss and then closed and locked the front door behind her.



We set the oven to preheat and opened up the pizza box, both laughing at the sight of the frozen wasteland that its surface had become during its months of travel and hand exchanges in order to even get here to grace the freezer aisle shelves of Marta's Market.



As the pizza cooked, I paid Rachel back her $20, we cracked open a few beers, lit up a joint, popped Shaun of the Dead in the Blu-Ray player as Rachel had claimed to never had seen the masterpiece of a film before, and we played a few quick rounds of catch with Rowdy in the backyard. 



Once the pizza was ready, we sat down on the living room couch as we ate our shares of the mostly edible pie and laughed at the movie, as well as each other's weed induced pieces of commentary, and it wasn't long before the film came to an end.



We sat their in silence for a few moments, both lost in our high thoughts it would seem, before I spoke up. ""Want to watch Hot Fuzz next?"" I asked.



I turned to face her, but she was staring off into the distance, still thinking about something deeply.



Then, with a quick snap of her head, she turned her piercing green-eyed gaze to me, the whites of her eyes now mildly bloodshot. ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" She asked.



I laughed inappropriately, imagining that she just randomly decided to start roleplaying that we were in a job interview due to my inebriated state of mind. But as the laughter calmed, I apologized, explained, and then took her question seriously.



""Honestly? Right here,"" I said. ""I want to be right here with you and Rowdy. Fishing for work. I don't know..."" I trailed off then, unsure of what she wanted to hear.



""No, be serious,"" she urged.



""I am,"" I replied. ""This life is peaceful. After Afghanistan, I didn't know if I'd ever get that again. A peaceful, simple life. It's what I needed. What I wanted.""



Rachel held Rowdy's head in her lap as she listened, massaging her fingers through his short brindle colored fur.



""I guess I want to make more money, maybe work out of a boat of my own. But other than that, things are going pretty great.""



""I don't think that boat of yours will be able to haul in enough Pike to make a living, if I'm being honest,"" she said with a devious smile, referring to the little rowboat I had purchased shortly after moving here and now left beached in a small, secluded part of the cove. I'd often take it out with Rowdy, or Rachel, or both to enjoy some calm and quiet out on the water, smoke a joint, drink a few beers, watch the sunrise or sunset, maybe do a little recreational fishing.



""No,"" I laughed. ""But seriously. Maybe I could finance a boat of my own. There's plenty of Pike and mouths to feed to go around. I'm sure the Captain wouldn't mind. I could even sell out of town. It would be a hassle, but the better pay would account for that, I'm sure. Or maybe, I could buy the Helmsman off him if he ever decides to retire. Though I doubt he'd do so, unless it got to the point where he physically couldn't do the job anymore. I'm happy with this life, though. I want this life.""



Rachel smiled at that, leaning her head into my chest and snuggling it into me.



""What about you?"" I asked. ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?""



She opened her eyes to look up to me, her gaze full of emotion. ""Right here, with you,"" she said.



I smiled at that.



""Kiss me,"" She instructed, and I gladly obliged, leaning down and passionately interlocking our lips as I brought my hand up under her head, running my fingers through her hair and gently caressing the back of her scalp. That kiss turned into a full on make out session, which led us into the shower, which led us into bed, which then led into me waking up the following morning, our naked bodies interlocked, and I looked down with a smile at the peaceful and resting features of the woman I loved.



I hadn't realized it was what had awoken me at first, as all my attention from the moment my eyes opened had been on Rachel, but I could now hear someone banging on my front door, not furiously, but hard and consistent enough to imply some urgency.



I noticed then that Rowdy wasn't in his dog bed on the floor of my room, but was now out in the living room, barking at the front door.



Rachel stirred and groaned, clearly still too tired to start her day, and I disconnected our bodies before maneuvering myself off the bed and making my way to my closet.



I quickly pulled on a pair of boxers, a pair of jeans, and then slipped a camo Realtree long sleeve on over my head before stepping out of my room, closing the door behind me as Rachel was laying naked within. ""Quiet,"" I instructed Rowdy, and he immediately went silent, demonstrating the well-trained dog that he was. I then gave him some quick pets to assure him that he was right to alert me that someone was here, even though I wanted him to stop alerting now. I led him back into my room then, shutting him in with Rachel before proceeding to answer the door.



Whoever it was, mildly banged on the front door again.



""I'm coming!"" I called out. ""Jesus Christ, who bangs on someone's door at the 6:30 in the morning,"" I commented as I caught sight of the time on my microwave oven as I passed by the kitchen. ""This better be a fucking emergency.""



Looking through the peephole, I immediately realized that my house caller was Captain Burke. The burly man stood with his back to the door, wearing a red and brown checkered flannel, but I could make him out by his build, grey buzzcut, and the bushy grey beard that grew out around his face, too big to be obscured even by his large dome of a head. 



It was strange that he would be showing up here on our day off, but it wasn't unheard of, as there had been a few times where he'd had to come get me to help with some repair on the Helmsman or some such in order to make sure it was sea-ready by Monday morning. Or times when the Market was too stocked with fish to purchase more, and he needed someone to make a run with him out of town to sell the fish to markets of neighboring towns hours away while they were still fresh.



I sighed, unlocking the door and beginning to pull it open, realizing that the day I had planned of lying in bed with Rachel, having sex, watching comedy movies, drinking beers, smoking joints, and playing fetch with Rowdy, was now to be replaced with yet another day of work. 



""Mornin' Cap'n,"" I said as I finished pulling open the door. 



""Green Gill,"" Captain Burke replied, his back still turned to me. ""I need your help wish shomething, it shouldn't take long."" He was slurring his words a bit, as if he had been up all night drinking.



*I knew it.* ""Alright,"" I sighed. ""Just let me grab my coat and some gloves, say goodbye to Rachel."" At least if he was right about whatever it was not taking long, I could maybe make it back in time to still spend the day with her.



I turned to step away then, when some sort of primitive survival instinct compelled me not to turn my back to the Captain. ""Just don't forget to listen when the world speaks to you,"" Kajak's words echoed through my mind, and I knew my instincts were right in that moment. Something was off. Something was wrong with Captain Burke.



I turned back, keeping my eyes trained on him. Every other time he had shown up on my day off asking something of me, he showed up with coffee, doughnuts, and an apology, promising double pay for the day. Then there was his speech, Captain Burke enjoyed his drink just like any man, but he wasn't one to stay up until sunrise drinking like some college kid, especially if he knew there was work to be done the following day. Also, there was the fact that I'd never seen Captain Burke refuse to look another man in the eye as he spoke to him, that was just not something his character would allow for. And lastly, as I cautiously watched him now, I could see that his body was sporadically twitching, though he seemed to be fighting against the urge, and I could even hear low guttural noises coming from his mouth, sounds and movements that I had never seen or heard him make before.



I took a step back toward the door, readying to slam it shut if the need arose. ""Captain Burke, why won't you look me in the eye?"" I asked.



A muffled chuckle escaped the Captain then. ""Quit meshing around, Green Gill,"" He slurred back. ""We have work to do, you're burning daylight.""



I hoped I was wrong, that I was just being paranoid because of Kajak's words yesterday and perhaps some lingering effects from the plethora of weed I had smoked the night before, but I needed to know before I took one step out this door with Burke. ""Captain, look at me,"" I urged.



""Who do you think you're giving ordersh to, boy?"" Captain Burke snapped back angrily.



""Burke, turn around.""



""Are you out of your-""



""Turn around.""



""You're about to be-""



""Look at me!""



An inhuman screech shrieked through the air then, as Burke turned, thrusting a white blur in the direction of my face.



I reflexively pulled my head out of the way and caught Burkes burly arm in such a way that I had control of his wrist and elbow, to apply pressure, or even break the limb if need be.



As our movement slowed, I saw just what it was Burke had thrust at my face, as one of the tongue-stealing Isopods wriggled about in his grip, staring back at me with beady, soulless, black eyes, its legs reaching out for me, its mouth opening to let out a little scream of its own.



""What the fuck!?"" I turned back to face Burke then, seeing what had become of my noble Captain. An even larger Isopod resided in his mouth, in place of where his tongue should be. It held his jaws pried open with its limbs, allowing a steady flow of bloody drool to trail down out of the corners of Burke's mouth and into his beard, crusting the grey hairs red. The Captain's eyes now dangled out of his face, hanging past his cheeks by bloody cords, their sockets crying tears of blood, and in their place, eye stalks like that of a slug or snail rose up out from them, their alien movements putting on a terrifying display.



I screamed in horror, immediately bending the Captain's arm in a painful manner, gaining myself a dominant position, and then I threw him out of my front doorway with all my strength, watching as he flipped over himself, and painfully tumbled down the set of stairs leading up to my little front porch.



I could see more people approaching the house now, the nearest being Arturo, only, I didn't know if they were really people anymore. As where Arturo's eyes should be placed within their sockets, they instead dangled out in front of his face, and two eye stalks stretched up out of them in their place.



I slammed my front door and locked it, hearing Rowdy beginning to stir now, letting out little yipping barks as his claws scraped across the hardwood flooring of my room.



I reached my bedroom door and opened it just as Rachel had reached it from the other side, having seemed to have awoken and already put on some clothing while I was dealing with Burke.



""What's going on?"" She asked.



I pushed her back into the room, forcing my way inside as well, and then I closed and locked my bedroom door behind us.



I immediately moved to my closet then, grabbing my Army green Kevlar vest from where it hung and throwing it on over my torso, plates already aligned within, and my KA-BAR already sheathed to its chest. 



""Tyler? What the hell is happening right now?"" Rachel asked again.



I strapped my sidearm holster to my right leg, and then opened my nightstand, pulling out my handgun lockbox and placing it onto the bed.



Rachel grew frustrated at my lack of reply, moving for the bedroom door.



""No!"" I stopped her, grabbing her wrist.



""Tyler! What the hell is going on!? Are you having some sort of psychotic break right now or something!? You're putting on your gear like you're back in Afghanistan! You're scaring me! Say something!"" 



I nodded, taking a deep breath. ""I'm not going crazy, even though what I'm about to tell you is going to sound crazy. But you need to trust me and listen to me, because we are in danger right now and we need to move, okay?""



She nodded, her eyes filling with involuntary tears.



Banging started sounding out from the front door once again, though this time, it was much more forceful, as if Burke was now attempting to break it down.



Rachel jumped, turning her gaze toward the bedroom door briefly and then back to me to hear my explanation.



I moved back to my handgun case as I spoke, unlocking it. ""There was something infesting the fish yesterday, an Isopod, the Captain called it. That's why I didn't want you to buy fish for dinner, remember? I don't know how, or why, but it is infesting people now, taking them over.""



""What?"" Rachel forced out a fake laugh in disbelief. 



I retrieved my black Springfield XD Tactical .45 from the case, slapped one of the magazines home, chambered a round, then holstered my sidearm before also slotting the two spare magazines in the case into the holster as well. ""I don't know how to explain what's happening, or how to make sense of it, but it is happening. Whatever that creature is, it was in Burke's mouth, controlling him. It pushed his eyes out of his fucking head for Christ's sake, and it was using his speech to try and trick me. It forced him to attack me. The worst part, is that he was trying to force one of those things into my mouth as well, to make me like him, to turn me into one of them."" I rambled all of this off as quickly as I could, knowing that there was little to no time to catch her up, and to get her to trust me.



Rachel backed away from me now, keeping her eyes cautiously trained on my holstered sidearm. ""Tyler... I want to leave,"" she said.



""No,"" I begged. ""Please, you have to believe me. I know this sounds crazy, but it's the truth. Just trust me for the next minute, and if you don't see what I see, then walk away and call Sheriff Dunn on me, okay?""



Rachel nodded, forcing down a lump in her throat. She was clearly terrified that I was losing my mind, and having some sort of PTSD mental breakdown, but she trusted me enough to give me a chance to prove that wasn't the case.



Glass shattered then, from somewhere within the house, causing Rachel and I to both jump.



I listened closely for a moment then, hearing footfalls as someone entered the house from whatever window they had just broken.



I looked to Rachel with terror and concern. ""They're inside,"" was all I said. I grabbed my walkie talkie from my nightstand, using the clip on the back to strap it to the front of my vest, realizing as I did so, that she had left hers out in the living room inside of her purse, and that it was out of our reach now. I then took her by the hand and pulled her toward my bedroom window.



I let go of her, unlocked the window, and pulled it up and open. I then stuck my head outside, looking back and forth and all around, seeing that my backyard and the visible areas around it were clear, for now at least. ""It's clear, go,"" I instructed, gently pushing Rachel toward the window.



""You want me to crawl out your window?"" She asked, still not fully grasping our situation in her confused and freshly awoken state.



""Rachel,"" I said sternly. ""This is life or death. Move.""



She met my gaze, seeing how serious I was, and nodded, turning to crawl her way out through the window.



As she got her footing outside, I turned to Rowdy, pointed to him, and then pointed out the window. ""Through!"" I commanded, and he didn't hesitate to gracefully leap through the window, landing gently in my backyard. I then clicked my tongue and snapped my fingers to draw his attention back to me. I then pointed to him, and then to Rachel. ""Guard!"" I instructed, and he immediately got to work, stalking around Rachel and eyeing his surroundings, emanating a low warning growl to any that would dare attack her.



I moved back to my closet now, knowing there was one more thing I would need if we were to stand a fighting chance. I owned several guns, and had plenty of spare ammunition, but there wasn't enough time to grab it all. I knew that I needed to not get greedy, and that expedient movement would be the main key to my survival here. But I feared my sidearm wouldn't be enough alone to protect us from whatever was going on.



I grabbed the tan case that housed my AR-15 from the closet and hefted it up onto my bed, getting to work on putting in the combination to unlock it just as someone or something slammed into my bedroom door from the other side and began furiously banging against it. I unlocked the case, pulled the rifle up out of it, and then slammed a magazine home in the well, chambering a round just before the wood of my bedroom door shattered inward, and the door itself was wrenched off its hinges.



A shrieking cry sounded out as Arturo flung himself through my bedroom doorway and in my direction.



I pulled up my rifle at the last second, wedging it between us, and squeezed the trigger twice, punching two rounds into the dead center of his chest and propelling him back. 



We both froze for a moment, and then the Louse in his mouth let out another shriek, and he launched himself forward again, as if the fatal wounds didn't even phase him.



I pulled the barrel of the rifle up then and popped off a round just before he reached me, bursting apart the Louse within his mouth and painting the bedroom wall and doorframe with Arturo's blood and brain matter.



His form flung back from the force of the gunshot and then crumpled to the floor like a sack of bricks, but Burke replaced him in an instant, grabbing ahold of the barrel of my rifle before I could get a shot off on him, and shoving it to the side, causing me to fire a round needlessly into the wall.



He used his superior strength then from a lifetime of hard manual labor to wrench the rifle from my hands before thrusting the butt of it back into my Kevlar vest and forcing me back onto my bed. 



I thought, for less than a second, about drawing my sidearm and fighting for the rifle, but the other infested townsfolk that had made their way into my house and were now nearing the doorframe of my bedroom caused me to think better of it.



It was time to retreat.



I rolled back over my bed, falling to my hands and knees on the hardwood floor, and then launched myself through the open window, landing with my weight into my shoulder on the cold hardened ground of my backyard and using my momentum to roll with the impact, managing to quickly get to my feet.



""Tyler!"" Rachel screamed in terror, clearly having seen some of what had just went down through the window.



""Go! Go! Move!"" I urged, pushing her forward, covering her with my vest protected torso as Rowdy followed along behind us.



Gunshots cracked off behind me now, whizzing past us, and I continued using my body to cover Rachel's as we made our way to the side gate of my backyard.



A burning sting traced along the inside of my left arm, causing me to wince. Then a round full on impacted with the left side of my lower back, hitting home with my Kevlar vest, the impact nearly toppling me forward as the air was punched out of my lungs, and I gasped.



""Tyler!?"" Rachel cried out.



""Go!"" I managed to gasp out, wincing and wheezing in pain as we moved, hoping against all hope that the bullet hadn't managed to get through my vest.



We reached the gate, and I allowed myself to fall into it for a moment to catch my breath as Rachel unlatched it and pushed it open.



""Come on,"" she said, taking me by the arm and pulling me through as I groaned in pain, leading me out onto a street filled with infested townsfolk that I once called neighbors. But I knew their minds were gone, replaced by the will of the Isopods that had stolen their tongues, now overcome with the urge to hunt down and assimilate everyone they once knew.",1,1745134085.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unlocking the Secrets to Perfect Dutch Oven Brownies

The magic of Dutch oven brownies lies in their gooey, rich texture combined with a slightly crispy crust. When baked in a Dutch oven, brownies develop a unique, moist center that many traditional baking methods struggle to achieve. But how do you master the art of creating these irresistible treats? It all comes down to understanding the techniques and the special characteristics of your Dutch oven.

### Choosing the Right Ingredients for Gooeyness

To craft brownies that are delectably gooey, start with high-quality ingredients. Chocolate is the star here. Opt for a mix of cocoa powder and melted dark chocolate for depth of flavor. Using pure vanilla extract adds a subtle sweetness which enhances the chocolate. Don‚Äôt forget to use fresh eggs and unsalted butter to control the flavor balance.

- **Butter:** Melted butter helps create a soft, moist texture.
- **Sugar:** A mix of white and brown sugar can provide gooeyness and a slight caramel undertone.
- **Chocolate:** Use at least 60% cocoa for rich flavor, combining cocoa powder with chunks or chips for texture.
- **Flour:** Use all-purpose flour but avoid over mixing; this keeps brownies tender.
- **Eggs:** They bind ingredients together and add moisture.

### Preparing Your Dutch Oven for Brownie Baking

A clean, well-seasoned Dutch oven is essential. The heavy cast iron ensures even heat distribution which helps the brownies bake evenly without burning. Before pouring the batter, grease the Dutch oven with butter or a non-stick spray and optionally line the bottom with parchment paper. This step makes removing the brownies easier and prevents sticking.

### Temperature and Baking Time: The Balancing Act

Maintaining the right temperature in your Dutch oven is key to gooey brownies. Typically, a low and steady heat works best, around 325¬∞F (163¬∞C) to 350¬∞F (177¬∞C). Too high, and you risk burning the edges while leaving the center undercooked. Too low, and the brownies might dry out or take too long to bake.

‚Äã \*Shop Here - https://hownow101.github.io/dutchovensale -\* ‚Äã  
  
One effective method is to preheat the Dutch oven with coals or in a conventional oven, then bake the brownies approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Positioning coals on the lid distributes heat evenly from the top and bottom, mimicking the effect of a conventional oven. Rotate the lid and base halfway through baking for uniform heat exposure.

### Mixing Techniques for Superior Texture

When mixing your brownie batter, aim for a gentle approach. Over-mixing activates gluten in the flour excessively, resulting in a cakey texture rather than the desired fudgy gooeyness. Stir just until the ingredients combine.

For even richer brownies, fold in chocolate chunks or nuts at the end of mixing. This variation adds bits of chewy texture while keeping the interior moist.

### Tips to Maintain Moisture and Prevent Dryness

- **Don‚Äôt overbake:** Check doneness by inserting a toothpick‚Äîit should come out with moist crumbs, not dry.
- **Use proper lid sealing:** A tight seal traps moisture inside the Dutch oven, keeping brownies moist.
- **Let them cool properly:** Allow brownies to set for at least 15 minutes before cutting to let the gooey center firm up slightly.

### Creative Twists to Elevate Your Dutch Oven Brownies

Once you master the basic recipe, get creative by adding flavor enhancements or toppings. Swirl in caramel or peanut butter before baking for a decadent surprise inside. Sprinkle sea salt lightly over the top right after baking to contrast the sweetness. Alternatively, blend in some espresso powder to intensify the chocolate flavor.

Try topping finished brownies with fresh fruit like raspberries or a dollop of whipped cream for a gourmet touch. These tweaks not only improve taste but also create beautiful presentations perfect for gatherings.

### Cleaning and Caring for Your Dutch Oven Post-Baking

After enjoying your gooey Dutch oven brownies, proper care for your equipment ensures lasting performance. Clean your Dutch oven with warm water and a brush‚Äîavoid soap to preserve seasoning. Dry it thoroughly and apply a light coat of oil to maintain the non-stick finish and prevent rust.

With consistent care and practice using these techniques, you‚Äôll soon be confident in baking Dutch oven brownies that impress with every bite‚Äîgooey on the inside, perfectly textured on the outside, and bursting with rich chocolate flavor.

Tips and Tricks for Perfect Dutch Oven Baking: Enhancing Flavor and Texture
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mastering Heat Control for Even Cooking

A major factor in perfect Dutch oven baking is managing the heat properly. Dutch ovens hold and distribute heat evenly, but this can be a double-edged sword if the temperature isn‚Äôt controlled well. Too much heat can burn the food on the bottom or sides, while too little heat results in uneven cooking or a doughy texture. To get it right, use charcoal briquettes or an oven set to moderate temperatures, generally between 325¬∞F and 375¬∞F. Remember, you need indirect heat when baking, so placing coals or setting the oven temperature evenly around the Dutch oven helps maintain consistent temperature inside.

When using coals, a simple rule of thumb is to divide coals equally between the top lid and base to create balanced heat distribution. For example, if you use 20 coals, place 10 beneath and 10 on the lid. This prevents hotspots and helps you achieve a uniform bake with beautifully browned edges and moist interiors.

### Preparing Your Dutch Oven for Best Results

Seasoning your Dutch oven properly is crucial for both flavor and sticking prevention. If you have a cast iron Dutch oven, start by cleaning it well and applying a thin coat of oil to the surface before baking anything. This seasoning process not only protects the metal but also adds depth to your baked goods‚Äô flavor.

Before pouring batter or dough into your Dutch oven, line the bottom with parchment paper or lightly grease the interior to create an easy release layer. This small step saves you from struggling to remove your baked items and keeps the interior cleaner.

### Enhancing Moisture for a Perfect Texture

To get those delectably gooey and tender textures, controlling moisture content during baking is key. A Dutch oven‚Äôs excellent heat retention naturally traps steam, which tenderizes baked treats like brownies and bread. If you want extra moisture, try placing a small pan of water inside the Dutch oven or even slightly increasing the moisture in your recipe by adding a touch more butter or oil.

‚Äã \*Shop Here - https://hownow101.github.io/dutchovensale -\* ‚Äã  
  
For desserts like brownies, this moist environment boosts the fudginess while still allowing the edges to get crisp and invitingly chewy. Avoid overbaking, as excessive heat over time will dry out the contents, defeating the purpose of using a Dutch oven in the first place.

### Experimenting with Baking Times and Ingredients

Every Dutch oven is a bit different, and so is every recipe. Experimentation is part of the fun and will help you fine-tune the baking process to perfection. Start by following a trusted recipe and monitor the cooking closely. Use a toothpick or cake tester inserted in the center to check doneness‚Äîpull it out with moist crumbs attached for gooey brownies or breads.

Adjust baking times based on the results. If you notice the outside browning too quickly but the center remains undercooked, lower the temperature slightly and extend the bake time. Conversely, if the bake is dry or overdone, reduce the time and possibly the heat.

### Utilizing Dutch Oven Versatility

Your Dutch oven isn‚Äôt just for temperature control; it also enhances flavor by mimicking a brick oven environment. Slow heat circulation means flavors develop deeply. Consider adding spices or infusing ingredients like vanilla or coffee powder into your batter before baking. These small touches can elevate the taste sensation significantly.

‚Äã \*Shop Here - https://hownow101.github.io/dutchovensale -\* ‚Äã  
  
Consider baking savory items alongside your sweet treats if you‚Äôre camping or cooking outdoors. The cast iron absorbs residual aromas, which will add subtle flavor notes to subsequent batches of food, connecting every bite with rich character and warmth.

### Cleaning and Maintenance for Long-Term Use

Proper care keeps your Dutch oven working perfectly for years and ensures your baked goods always shine. Avoid harsh soaps or detergents on cast iron, as they remove the crucial seasoning layer. Instead, clean with warm water and a stiff brush immediately after use.

Dry your Dutch oven thoroughly to prevent rust, and occasionally reapply a thin layer of cooking oil to maintain the seasoning. Storing it with the lid slightly ajar helps avoid moisture buildup inside, preserving the quality of your equipment for future baking adventures.

### Final Thought: Creating Your Signature Dutch Oven Recipes

Practice is essential. As you become more familiar with your Dutch oven‚Äôs heating quirks and your preferred recipes, you‚Äôll develop your own tricks to heighten flavor and texture. Take notes on what works each time‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs minor temperature tweaks, ingredient swaps, or baking time adjustments. This tailored approach brings out the best in your Dutch oven brownies or any other baked good, making every bite gooey, rich, and delicious.

### Conclusion

Creating Dutch oven brownies that are both gooey and delicious is a rewarding kitchen adventure you can master with the right techniques. By understanding how to control heat and timing, you ensure your brownies bake evenly without drying out, preserving that rich, fudgy texture everyone loves. Remember, using quality ingredients and layering flavors thoughtfully will elevate your brownies from simple treats to memorable desserts.

When working with a Dutch oven, managing the balance between direct heat and gentle baking is key.

Additionally, small changes like lining your Dutch oven with parchment paper or lightly greasing it can prevent sticking and make cleanup easier, letting you focus on enjoying your creation.

Don‚Äôt hesitate to experiment with add-ins such as nuts, chocolate chips, or a swirl of caramel to tailor your brownies to your taste. These tips and techniques together help transform basic brownie recipes into indulgent treats that impress every time you serve them. With practice, baking Dutch oven brownies becomes a simple joy that brings comfort and delight, whether you‚Äôre camping under the stars or baking in your backyard.

1k3h6me,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1k3h6me/letting_go/,Letting go,"A few years ago, when I was still in college, I fell in love with a lady schoolmate of mine, but got rejected. We kept hanging out, but a year or so later I felt that I was always initiating and I wasn't being prioritized as much as I prioritized her, which she confirmed with a ""yeah, I don't think you're that important anymore"" text. So I cut contact with her.

But due to my social media addictions, I've been stalking her Instagram profile (mostly private but sometimes public) for almost 2 years. I know it's not good for me and in a way disrespectful to her, so I try blocking her profile so that I can't find her profile on the Search function. But then I'd go to the settings and unblock her, sometimes a few times per hour. This is very, very unhealthy.

Recently, I was snooping on my college mate's profile (private) again when I saw that a friend I'd known for more than a decade was following her. They had recently become acquainted with each other in university. (I'm attending a different university) A few hours ago, I prompted my friend to text my college mate ""Hey where did you attend college? My friend (enter my name) also attended that college during the same time, do you know him?"" (and of course she does)

As I continued to doom scroll, I realized four things:

1. That everything I knew about my college mate were snippets, not the real and complete her. This isn't good enough for a genuine connection.
2. I'm drowning in an unhealthy amount of nostalgia, always thinking back to the times when I was hanging out with her but those times were almost 3 years ago
3. I'm not sure if she wants to reconnect with me, seeing I requested to follow her once this year and got ignored and last year when her profile went public and I saw her stories in 30 minutes her profile went private again. Also me thinking of her, no matter how intensely, does not change her opinion on me.
4. I tell myself I wanna check on her and make sure she's doing alright, but I myself am not doing alright. Apart from dealing with addictions (yes plural), I also have an extremely low GPA and I'm not working. I'm unproductive and this addiction is one of the leading causes. Yet she's the exact opposite- she's got an amazing GPA (at least in college) and she's learnt some software skills. I'm going to make unhealthy comparisons between me and her, causing me to feel unworthy and hate myself more even when I'm actively trying to improve.

So I texted my friend ""Nah you don't have to mention me in front of her, I want to make sure I sever the connection I had with her, completely."" I don't care if my feelings are romantic (they probably are) or platonic (what I'm telling myself), it's best to leave this in the past because it's so unhealthy.

It hurts so much, emotionally and physically but it'll ultimately be better- for all three of us. My friend can make a new connection with her, she loses an online stalker and I get to clear myself and make a fresh start. As I'm typing this, my face heated up and my heart beat faster because reasons. I don't know. Over the past two years, whenever I was near her university, a part of me hoped I'd bump into her (I never did), yet when I got back to my place, I was glad I never did because unhealthy feelings would come back.

I also want to add, if anybody's in the comments section insulting this lady I will delete those comments. You can make comments about whether or not my or my college mate's actions were justified, but you cannot make comments insulting her. Me stalking her was caused by nobody but me, so nobody make this a ""coffee women"" moment.

So yeah, that's it. Thanks for reading. Sorry it's so long, I needed a vent.",1,1745133960.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I said yes. I trusted him.
Then he came home and told me we had to postpone the wedding.
""I think we need to postpone the wedding.""
I didn't react. Not at first. I couldn't. The words didn't feel real. Like I'd heard them through water, or glass.
Then, slowly, I whispered:
""Is it Selene?""
He shut his eyes. ""Nothing happened. I swear to you, nothing happened. But... yeah. It's her.""
I waited.
""I didn't expect it. I thought it was in the past. But when I saw her, it all came back so fast. And now I'm caught in this place where I don't know what's real. I want to do the right thing‚ÄîI'm your fianc√©. I love you. I owe it to you, to us, to figure this out. But I can't marry you when someone else is in my head.""
I stared at him like he was a stranger.
____________
 
""I never thought the sunniest days could end in shadows.""
My name is June.
Fitting, isn't it? The month of beginnings, warmth, light. I've always been the one who smiled first, who forgave quickly, who believed in love like it was a religion. I guess that's why they used to call me Sunshine‚Äîthe tall girl with golden hair and sky-blue eyes, always dancing through life like the world was made of music.
And for a while, it was.
I was one of the ""odd ones,"" a nickname we gave ourselves in the little online group where we met‚Äîeach of us named after a month, each of us a little offbeat, a little too much or not quite enough. But together, we made sense. I loved them like sisters, like a compass that always pointed me home.
And then there was Aaron.
My safe place. My wild adventure. My first and only real love.
He came into my life like gravity‚Äîpulling me in gently but permanently. He saw something in me beyond the dancer, the dreamer. He helped me build my dance studio from the ground up, working late into the night after his shifts, covered in dust and sweat, just to see my dreams come alive. He used to say, ""If you're dancing, I'm where I'm meant to be.""
I loved him more than I thought was humanly possible.
So when he knelt on one knee last year, ring trembling in his hand, I said yes with my whole heart.
Six years together. Six years of laughter, struggle, growing, planning. I thought the hard part was over. I thought love, real love, was unshakable.
Then six weeks before the wedding, he asked me if he could meet up with her.
His high school sweetheart. The ""one that got away.""
He said it so gently, almost apologetically, like he didn't want to make a sound too loud. I felt a flicker of fear in my chest, but I swallowed it down. We'd been through too much for me to start doubting him now.
So I nodded. I trusted him. I told myself that love this deep couldn't be undone by nostalgia.
I was wrong.
That night, he came home quiet. And when he finally met my eyes, the world tilted.
""I think we need to postpone the wedding.""
I don't remember what I said. Maybe I didn't say anything. Maybe the silence was too loud to speak through.
But the moment he said those words, I felt everything break.
The plans. The promises. The picture of forever we'd painted together.
I didn't wait. I couldn't. I canceled everything.
Because when someone's confused about you, they don't deserve your certainty.
And I was certain. About me. About love. About him‚Äîuntil he wasn't certain about me.
This isn't the story I thought I'd be telling. It's not the one I wanted.
But it's mine now.
###Chapter One: Sunshine and Shadows
""You need to stop letting Aaron decorate.""
December grinned as she plucked one of the little sunflower napkin rings off the table. ""This is aggressively cheerful.""
I laughed, smoothing the matching table runner. ""What can I say? He calls me his sunshine. I think he takes it a bit too literally.""
My house was bathed in golden yellows and soft creams‚Äîsunflowers everywhere. It was sweet, really. Over the years, Aaron had taken my nickname and built a little world around it. My friends teased me about it constantly, but I loved it.
December had dropped by with a list in one hand and a protein bar in the other. ""I came to check if you need anything for the wedding. May and Jan are handling the invites, and I'm on cake-tasting duty, which, frankly, I think I won.""
I smiled, touched. ""You're all amazing. I honestly don't know what I'd do without you guys.""
We were only a few weeks away now. Everything was falling into place. I had the man I loved, a home we built together, a dance studio he had practically made with his bare hands, and a future that felt golden‚Äîjust like my living room.
The front door opened. Aaron's voice rang out. ""I brought coffee!""
December stood up quickly. ""And that's my cue to go."" She winked. ""Enjoy your caffeinated fianc√©.""
She left just as Aaron walked in, grinning with a coffee tray in hand. He pecked the top of my head, handed me my cup‚Äîextra cinnamon, just how I liked it‚Äîand then sat beside me, suddenly... quiet.
""Everything okay?"" I asked, studying his face.
""Yeah. Yeah, just‚Äîsomething weird happened."" He ran a hand through his hair, then looked at me with that sheepish, guilty look he only wore when he thought he might upset me. ""I got a message today. From Selene.""
I blinked. ""Selene?""
""My high school girlfriend. You remember‚ÄîI told you about her once. We were together for a few years. She left for college. I haven't heard from her in, like, forever.""
He paused, waiting for my reaction. I gave him nothing. Just listened.
""She wants to catch up. Just... talk. See how life's been.""
My stomach clenched. There was no logical reason for it. But something felt off. Heavy.
""You want to go?"" I asked softly.
""I thought about it. I don't know. I was going to say no. But it's just coffee, right? Nothing weird. I just thought it might be nice to close that chapter or... whatever.""
I couldn't speak at first. My mouth had gone dry.
He leaned in, brushing his fingers along my jaw. ""But if you don't want me to, I won't go. I promise. You say the word.""
I looked at him, at the man I'd loved for years. The man who'd supported every dream I had, who'd made me feel safe and adored. I couldn't let one message make me insecure. That wasn't who I was. That wasn't who we were.
So I smiled and shook my head. ""No, it's okay. It would be ridiculous of me to say no. You should go.""
He smiled, pulled me into his arms, and pecked my forehead.
But as he held me, I couldn't shake the weight pressing down on my chest.
That night, he went to see her. And I went to the studio he built for me‚Äîwalls covered in mirrors and lined with tiny ballet shoes. I taught kids how to leap, how to spin, how to hold their heads high. My studio always smelled like wood polish and lavender. The mirrors gleamed, and sunlight poured through the windows, bouncing off the polished floors like warm little halos. Kids had just finished their class‚Äîgiggling, still in their tutus and sneakers, waving goodbye to Miss June. I cleaned up the ribbons and glitter like I always did, humming under my breath, trying to keep my mind blank. I didn't want to think about Aaron and Selene. I didn't want to give that voice in my head another inch of space.
""Earth to Sunshine.""
I looked up to see Leo leaning against the doorway to the main studio, sipping from his water bottle.
He was tall, dark-haired, charming in that disarming, playful way. We'd danced together for years‚Äîpartner showcases, recitals, some small competitions‚Äîand he was good. Ridiculously good. The kind of partner that made you feel lighter, stronger, better.
""Sorry,"" I said, grabbing a towel and tossing it at him. ""Zoned out.""
He caught it with a grin. ""Zoning out during a samba rehearsal? Wow. I'm hurt.""
I rolled my eyes. ""We're not rehearsing today, Leo. You just showed up because you're addicted to the sound of your own heels on my floors.""
He laughed. ""I show up because you're here. You make this place worth the noise.""
I paused, slightly thrown, but brushed it off with a playful nudge. ""Flattery gets you nowhere, Reyes.""
He looked at me then‚Äîreally looked. ""Maybe not. But it's true.""
The silence lingered for a second too long. I busied myself by fixing the strap on one of the practice heels left behind, feeling heat creep into my cheeks. Leo took a step forward, then hesitated. ""If you ever need anything‚Äîanything at all‚Äîyou know I'm around, right?""
I nodded, smiling faintly. ""Thanks. I know.""
He left after that, with a lingering glance that I still didn't fully understand. Or maybe I just didn't want to. Leo was... kind. Safe. But Aaron was home. Aaron was mine.
I stayed back longer than I needed to, pretending to work on choreography I didn't even write down. Just trying to push down the unease. By the time I got home, the sky was turning the color of old peaches, streaked with gold and bruised pinks. The house was quiet. Too quiet.
Aaron still wasn't back.
I checked my phone. No messages. I tried calling. Straight to voicemail.
A strange ache bloomed in my chest. I shook it off, blaming poor reception or a dead battery. I kicked off my shoes, made tea, and sat at the kitchen island with my phone in hand, staring at the empty space where his keys usually sat.
He was just catching up, I told myself. Just talking. I was being ridiculous.
But the voice was louder now. Stronger. Meaner.
What if she reminded him of who he used to be?
What if he missed that? Missed her?
I shut my eyes, hating how fast my heart was racing. Then I heard the keys in the lock.
I stood too quickly, nearly knocking over my tea. The door opened. Aaron stepped inside.
He looked... normal. Too normal.
""Hey, baby,"" he said, dropping his keys into the dish and reaching for me. But something in my belly turned to ice. Something about the way he pecked my cheek like he hadn't vanished for hours. Something about the scent on his jacket that didn't belong to me.
""Sorry I didn't answer,"" he added casually. ""Lost track of time.""
I smiled. But it didn't reach my eyes.
And something inside me‚Äîsomething quiet and knowing‚Äîcurled into a ball and braced for impact.
###Chapter Two: The Fateful Words
I went to his office.
I told myself it was just a sweet surprise. I needed to see him. Maybe peck him behind his desk like I used to when we were still dreaming about our future instead of doubting it.
Beatrice, his coworker, greeted me at the front. She smiled, warm as always. ""June! You look so good. Wedding countdown, huh?""
I smiled too, though it felt brittle. ""Yeah. Almost there.""
Then she added, with a tilt of her head, ""I didn't know Aaron came in late today. Everything okay?""
I froze.
""Oh... yeah,"" I lied. ""He just had something this morning. All good.""
She nodded and led me back, knocking once before opening the door. ""Your fianc√©e's here,"" she chirped before stepping away.
Aaron looked up, startled. Not the happy, flirty surprise I'd hoped for.
His expression shifted too quickly‚Äîsurprised, then irritated, then masked behind that polite smile I'd started to loathe.
""What are you doing here?"" he asked, not unkind but not exactly thrilled either.
""I brought you coffee,"" I said, holding it out like some desperate offering. ""Thought I'd surprise you.""
He glanced at the cup and said flatly, ""I already had one.""
Then turned back to his computer.
I stood there, awkward and invisible.
After a long beat, he sighed. ""Sorry, June. I'm just swamped today.""
He didn't even reach for my hand.
I got the message.
I smiled again, brittle as glass, and walked out like everything was fine.
I went straight to the studio.
I choreographed something angry. Wild. Confused. The kind of movement that doesn't look pretty but feels like screaming. Every count felt like a question I didn't want to ask. Every turn, every stomp, was a sentence left unsaid.
Leo watched from the side, arms crossed. When the music stopped, he didn't clap. He just looked at me.
""You good?"" he asked quietly.
""Yeah,"" I said, waving it off. ""Just blowing off steam.""
He didn't believe me. But he let it go.
That became the routine.
Teach kids to dance‚Äîsmile, giggle, twirl. Pretend.
Go home.
Peck a stranger who smiled and laughed but never really looked at me anymore.
Two weeks of pretending.
Then I broke.
One night, I stood in the kitchen and just said it, voice trembling:
""I need an answer, Aaron. Something's wrong, and I can't breathe like this anymore.""
He looked at me for a long time. Then nodded.
""I'll talk to you tonight.""
The rest of the day was agony. I taught with shaking hands, laughed too loud, made excuses for the tears in my eyes. I couldn't eat. Could barely breathe.
Then night came.
And so did he.
His face was pale when he walked through the door. His shoulders slumped like the weight of something awful was pressing down on him.
""I think we need to postpone the wedding.""
I didn't react. Not at first. I couldn't. The words didn't feel real. Like I'd heard them through water, or glass.
Then, slowly, I whispered:
""Is it Selene?""
He shut his eyes. ""Nothing happened. I swear to you, nothing happened. But... yeah. It's her.""
I waited.
""I didn't expect it. I thought it was in the past. But when I saw her, it all came back so fast. And now I'm caught in this place where I don't know what's real. I want to do the right thing‚ÄîI'm your fianc√©. I love you. I owe it to you, to us, to figure this out. But I can't marry you when someone else is in my head.""
I stared at him like he was a stranger.
Like the man I was going to marry had died, and this ghost was trying to justify the killing.And that's exactly what it felt like. A death.
Not mine. His.
The man I loved‚Äîthe man who once courted me with handwritten notes tucked into my coat pockets, who waited outside my dance classes with takeout and flowers ""just because""‚Äîhe was gone. The man who would text me midday just to say he missed me, who made me playlists for every season, who spent a whole weekend repainting the living room because I once said I missed the color of sunflowers.
He decorated our home like it was a temple to joy‚Äîto me. Little gold suns in every room. A bright yellow kettle. A framed photo of us at the lake, captioned in his handwriting: My sunshine.
He even tattooed a small sun on his wrist. He told me, ""You're the only constant in my sky.""
I cried the day he did it. He pecked my tears and said, ""You light up everything.""
This was the man who planned his proposal with every detail mapped out‚Äîwho called my oddball best friends months in advance to make sure they could fly in. Who built me a dance studio with his own hands. Who invested in it because he believed in me even before I did.
He used to light up every time he saw me. Even if it had been an hour. His face would soften, and he'd open his arms like the world made sense again because I was in it.
Where did he go?
How did he forget me so easily?
How did I go from being his sun to being a shadow?
Now he won't even touch me. He doesn't look at me like I'm the light anymore‚Äîhe looks at me like I'm in the way.
How does love just... stop?
It didn't make sense. It still doesn't. So I knew I was going to mourn. Not the relationship. Not the wedding. I will mourn him‚Äîthe version of Aaron who made me feel like the most beloved person on this earth. The one who promised forever with stars in his eyes. Because whoever this is, this quiet, evasive man full of guilt and hesitation and excuses‚Äîhe's not the one who asked me to be his wife.
That man is gone.
And the grief of it...
I don't think I've ever known pain like this.
And just like that, I turned and walked out of the apartment we built together.",1,1745133913.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Both dates were butterflies. We‚Äôre both clearly attracted to each other. Touched, hugged and kissed. Spent 3+ hours with him on both dates. üôà

First date - he drove up to meet me (1hr), we grabbed coffee, and went on a hike. (I was nervous about the first date hike idea at first but turned out well), and had food after. It was literally the longest first date we both ever had. Both being introverts, there was nervousness, and awkward silences but he admitted later that he was comfortable with it. (Same) I initiated grabbing his arm while hiking and he held my hand all the way down the steep slope. He planned the coffee and hike and afterwards was an extension and I suggested the place so I felt like a good balance)

Second date - we met halfway, picked up pizza and beer and sat down at a park, catching sunset. Things went so well, he asked to hold me while sitting on my side and we talked more. He wanted some more time together so we stayed longer and went to another park just for the views. We were hugging side by side and I just couldn‚Äôt wait and asked him if I could kiss him. (had the longest first make out session for both again, even tho our skills are a bit dusty) it was getting a bit late and I had a trip next day so I asked him to drop me off after but he said he still wanted to spend more time (may be coz of alcohol) but I kissed him goodbye after a few more minutes) 

So far things are going well and I don‚Äôt want to mess this up in my intentional dating journey) Side note, I am what you might call ‚Äúmasculine-energy‚Äù female - I like to plan dates, lead and initiate things with mutual interest. He seems to be similar‚Äîshy, thoughtful, not very experienced, but open. (Said man‚Äôs last kiss was in 6th grade ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), i‚Äôm also shy and introverted but there is this urge of masculinity inside me)

Texting in between is pretty much low-key and casual. He asked me if I overthink when he doesn‚Äôt text me, i reassured him to keep it at a regular pace, and no need to text me every time of the day. 

So in a nutshell, i don‚Äôt want to scare him off and I‚Äôd love to make him feel special too. But I also don‚Äôt want to come on too strong or make him feel like he‚Äôs not leading enough.

1k3goiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicMoldExposure/comments/1k3goiw/is_toxic_mold_the_culprit/,Is toxic mold the culprit?,"Hello all,

I would like to mention my debilitating symptoms that I've been dealing with for 5 months without any findings so far.

Since I've had my nasal surgery in November 2024, these strange symptoms have shown up.  
Fresh out of the surgery, after my splints had been removed, I didn't get the expected results in breathing. I felt like I was suffocating and had a panic attack, and ended up in the ER that night. After having consistent panic attacks in December - almost every day -, a numbness in my body started to spread. The weird thing is that the numbness has started from my left arm, nowhere near the surgical area.

* As of April 2025, I¬†**have numbness on my face,**¬†nose, forehead, and left arm. It's not full numbness though, it's like reduced sensation. Upon waking up, I don't feel my ulnar area. My mouth and throat is numb too. When I pinch the both sides of my belly, the right side hurts more.
* My vision got worse, too. My sense of smell has also been downhill since the beginning.
* I'm extremely sensitive to stimulants in a way that a cup of coffee or one cig is enough to get my HR to 160s.
* My brain does not sense breathing, so I'm always in fight and flight mode, I'm unable to relax in any way. Currently on clonazepam.
* I no longer have headaches. I miss having headaches, only a dull sense. My brain is just understimulated.

All of my symptoms have gradually worsened following a panic attack. I'm feeling like I have damage in my body/nerves, but something is keeping my body from healing as it didn't get any better for months.

While investigating the root cause of my symptoms, I found out that mold toxicity could cause some neurological symptoms.

And the culprit is the filter coffee machine that I haven't cleaned for years. It most likely retained some mold, and I got intoxicated, and the surgery triggered the whole thing. That's my theory, though.

I'm very new to this, so I would really appreciate any input regarding what tests I should take and what to do to get better?

College was supposed to be exciting. New friends, freedom, late nights filled with laughter and memories  at least that‚Äôs what the movies said. But mine? It's mostly assignments, fake smiles, and feeling like I‚Äôm floating through time without touching anything real.
There are days I wake up, sit on my bed for an hour, and wonder why I‚Äôm even doing all this. Why this degree? Why this routine? Why do I feel so tired all the time when I haven‚Äôt even done anything exhausting?
Sometimes I think about running away  not in a dramatic way  just vanishing for a while. Maybe to a mountain town where nobody knows me. Where the silence won‚Äôt feel this loud.
But I don‚Äôt. I stay. I go to class. I come back. I sit in the cafe. And I hope ‚Äî that someday, it‚Äôll feel better. That I‚Äôll meet someone who gets it. That I‚Äôll laugh without pretending. That life will feel like life again.
Until then, I sip my coffee and let the world blur around me.

## What is Bit 11X Lexipro?

Bit 11X Lexipro is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others with ease. Think of it like a smart assistant that handles crypto trades for you based on real-time market data and pre-set parameters.

It uses algorithms to **analyze market trends** and execute trades automatically. This means you don‚Äôt have to spend hours glued to your screen watching charts. Whether you're a newbie testing the waters or someone who‚Äôs been around the crypto block, Bit 11X Lexipro offers features to make trading more efficient and less stressful.

## Who Created Bit 11X Lexipro?

The exact creators behind Bit 11X Lexipro are a bit mysterious. There‚Äôs no big-name founder like Brian Armstrong (hey, that‚Äôs me) or Satoshi Nakamoto attached to it. That said, it's believed to be developed by a group of fintech and crypto experts who wanted to build a tool that makes trading more accessible to the average person.

This isn‚Äôt uncommon in the crypto space‚Äîmany platforms operate anonymously to keep the focus on the tech and not the personalities behind it. Still, it‚Äôd be nice to have a little more transparency in this area.

### [üî• Start Trading with Bit 11X Lexipro Today](https://tinyurl.com/bdfxheyu)
## How Does Bit 11X Lexipro Work?

At its core, Bit 11X Lexipro relies on **AI-driven algorithms** and **machine learning** to scan the crypto markets. It identifies patterns, predicts market behavior, and makes trades based on those insights. The platform can execute trades faster than any human could, which is a big plus in the volatile world of crypto.

Here‚Äôs how the flow works:

- You set up your account and deposit funds.
- Choose your trading parameters (or go with the default settings).
- Let the platform handle the trading or use the manual mode if you prefer.
- Monitor your returns and withdraw profits when you‚Äôre ready.

It‚Äôs surprisingly hands-off if you want it to be, which is great for folks who don‚Äôt have time to day trade.

## Bit 11X Lexipro Pros and Cons

Like any platform, Bit 11X Lexipro has its strengths and weaknesses. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Beginner-friendly interface  
- ‚úÖ Automated trading saves time  
- ‚úÖ Multiple cryptocurrencies supported  
- ‚úÖ Demo account for practice  
- ‚úÖ Fast withdrawals  
- ‚úÖ Customizable trading settings  

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Lack of detailed info on the development team  
- ‚ùå Requires a $250 minimum deposit to access real trading  
- ‚ùå Risk of losses due to market volatility (this one‚Äôs universal in crypto)

Overall, the pros outweigh the cons‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre just starting and want a simple way to get into crypto trading.

## Bit 11X Lexipro ‚Äì Top Features

I get the skepticism‚Äîthere are definitely shady platforms out there. But based on my experience, **Bit 11X Lexipro is not a scam**. I was able to deposit funds, trade, and withdraw profits without any issues.

That said, always remember **no trading platform is risk-free**. Just because it‚Äôs legit doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get rich overnight. Use the demo account to test strategies and only invest what you can afford to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Bit 11X Lexipro?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for platforms in this category. It‚Äôs not free money‚Äîyou‚Äôll need to fund your account before accessing live trading features.

Use this wisely. Start small, test things out, and scale up only if you feel confident.

### Bit 11X Lexipro Customer Support

Support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested both, and responses were quick and helpful.

There‚Äôs no phone support (at least not yet), but the team seemed knowledgeable and eager to help when I reached out with questions.

## How do you start trading on Bit 11X Lexipro?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the Bit 11X Lexipro website and fill out the short registration form. You‚Äôll need to provide:

- First and last name
- Email address

That‚Äôs it‚Äîsuper quick.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once registered, you‚Äôll be connected to a partnered broker. You‚Äôll need to upload an ID and proof of address to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff). Then, make your first deposit of $250 via credit card, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding, you can start live trading or try out the demo account first. I highly recommend using demo mode to get familiar before putting real money on the line.

## How to Delete a Bit 11X Lexipro Account?

If you decide it‚Äôs not for you, just contact customer support and request account deletion. They‚Äôll walk you through the process.

Make sure to withdraw any remaining funds before doing this.

1k3gbmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1k3gbmi/150mg_bupropion_xl_my_first_week/,150mg Bupropion XL - My First Week,"Today I officially hit 1 week and 1 day on 150mg Bupropion XL. This week was...hell BOTH physically and mentally. I was previously on zoloft (50mg once a day; last week marked a year of being on it) but I discontinued it and went cold turkey as instructed by my psychiatrist because she said it was such a low dose, so there was no need to ween off and told me to take my first dose of bup the following morning. 

I wanted to get off zoloft because I think it gave me chronic fatigue syndrome, to the point where I couldn't even bare to get up and do simple chores. My sex drive was nonexistent. I was SUPER emotionless, numb, unaffectionate to my husband and insensitive to about anything in my life which started to affect our marriage. At that point, I decided to talk to my psychiatrist. So she started me on the lowest dose; 150mg bupropion XL since it supposedly acts as a ""stimulant"", said it ""can"" make you less numb, possibly increase your sex drive and get you ""up and going"". Here are my experiences with 150mg bup XL for my first week (still at 150mg today).

DAY 1
- took it at 8am, didn't feel anything (as expected)
- i drink coffee/matcha religiously but tried avoiding it when starting bup 
- had a little moment of excitement like life was going GREAT but that was possibly placebo effect
- had an anxiety attack after unintentionally drinking coffee at 3pm that day bc I felt groggy (that was.. weird? Maybe the bup was in my bloodstream by then.) Heart rate was increasing but eventually went back to normal  
- had a few brain fogs/light headedness and dizziness 

DAY 2: Trialing 
- didn't feel ""energized"" in the morning
- found myself getting sleepy around 12pm-3pm 
Some people said that taking it at night or a couple hours before bed made some wake up feeling energized. So I decided to take it at 6pm on day 3. (This didn't make a difference for me, so I went back to taking it in the morning around 8/9am)

DAY 3: Fatigue and Insomnia 
- woke up feeling the same as day 2; groggy
- started drinking caffeinated matcha but at a lower dose bc I read you can get seizures from drinking caffeine while on bup
- had EXCESSIVE fatigue during the day AGAIN (it was always betw. 12pm-3pm.) 
I'd get SO sleepy and end up napping until like 5-6pm
- took bup at 6pm this day hoping I'd get the ""energetic"" effects some people get when waking up in the morning 
- experienced my first night with insomnia, but not that bad. I usually fall asleep around 8-9pm, but since starting bup I'd fall asleep around 10-11pm. 10pm is kinda late for me. 
- had disruptive sleep; I'd wake up at 1am and stay up until 3am. Had a very hard time falling back asleep. I'd eventually fall back asleep for like half an hour (1 hour on a good day) and wake up at 4am or 5am. 
- minimal brain fogs/dizziness from sudden movements 

DAY 4: Slight Changes 
- still woke up groggy, probably due to the insomnia from the prev. night but the grogginess was not as bad as the first few 2 days 
- gained slight mental motivation; mentally (but not physically) felt like being productive, like going to the gym (I used to be consistent but stopped going bc of fatigue), getting up to do simple chores like laundry or sweeping the floor. 
However I felt like it was too soon to do all that bc of my fatigue so I decided to give it one more day.
- drank matcha for extra energy boost 
- felt sleepy in the afternoon (my usual hours 12-3pm)
- sex drive felt like increasing 
- noticed a HUGE decrease in my appetite as well as my water intake
The only times I'd drink water is when taking the medication or after eating a meal, so like 1 cup a day.
- went from eating 2 and a half times a day to once a day
I'd still get hungry, but I can't finish a full meal like I used to anymore. I'd take a few bites then I'm full. No nausea tho

DAY 5: Manic Episode 
- had insomnia again the prev. night, woke up at 1-2am
Only managed to fall asleep for 1 hour and a half then woke up at 4am, then couldn't fall back asleep till the morning. So I just went with my day.
- started to slowly reintroduce caffeine back into my daily routine (only matcha or coffee; i drink it an hour prior or after taking bup) 
- took bup at 11am hoping to avoid the sudden crash I get at 12-3pm and remain energetic. 
(That made no difference, still felt like crashing out by 1pm. Continued to take bup back at 9am the following morning)
- managed to go to the grocery store 
- after taking it at 11am, I felt slightly disoriented. For a few seconds I forgot how to put my car on park, and I was struggling to reverse park (it usually takes me 1 try) but still drove fine and very cautiously (I think this effect occurred bc I took it on an empty stomach and didn't drink enough water + I was hungry at the time of taking it)
- had dizziness/lightheadedness (immediately after taking it at 11am)
- had a random mental breakdown and suicidal episode (husband had to leave work early to accompany me)
- made an anonymous facebook post saying i felt like ending it, and needed help 
- felt depressed/exhausted later that day due to an argument with my husband 

DAY 6: Slight Changes in Energy 
- started hitting me a lil, energy wise. Started feeling more awake; it'd wake my body up in the early mornings
- had the energy/motivation to go to the gym
I found my usual workouts difficult to do (prob bc my body is adjusting to the medication + haven't been to the gym for a month) 
- crashed out betw. 12pm-3pm and woke up at 5pm. 
- had insomnia again this night; I bought 10mg melatonin gummies to help me sleep better, which helps A LITTLE bit. I take it at 8pm and knocks me out by 9pm. 
 
DAY 7: Feeling Productive 
- woke up feeling productive and energetic/motivated 
- did a few chores; fixed the bed and swept the floor, picked up my dog's poop in the yard 
- drove to my parent's house for breakfast 
- brain fogs/dizziness 
- crashed out at 12-3pm again (getting tired of these consistent crashes). Woke up at 4pm or 5pm and felt ""woke"" enough to not fall back asleep, but still really tired.
- took melatonin and fell asleep at 9pm, but woke up again at 1am. Fell back asleep at 2:45am ish and woke up at 4am. 

DAY 8: Today 
- woke up at 6am
- had the energy/motivation to go to the gym again in the morning 
- my usual workouts were still difficult (as expected while my body adjusts) 
- crashed out at 2pm
At this point I'm thinking of mentioning these afternoon crashes to my psychiatrist.
- brain fogs/dizziness in the afternoon
- drank a few sips of coffee one at a time bc I was tired after my 2pm nap
- it is currently 8pm while I'm typing this and I feel tired but not enough to fall asleep naturally without melatonin 
- I ""think"" my appetite is slowly coming back? I ate 1 and a half meals today with snacks.

I don't know if she's a narcissist, but I have suspicions, she's not entirely evil or malicious- but it's just, so much of what she does is so exhausting.

Whenever we talk or call, she is very, very judgmental, and she thinks it's funny- I know she's trying to make jokes with me, but she doesn't hear what she says or how she says it. 

Her jokes always revolve around other strangers and how they look, here are some examples as of recently. 

We went to the vet to pick-up my cats medication, a couple walked in holding a box, obviously the box contained something- my mom was completely oblivious to that, her main focus?

The man had some sort of eye problem, like he eyes weren't straight and pointed outwards, to me this is whatever, people have disabilities it's not the end of the world.

My mom turned away and whispered to me something like ""I don't even wanna say anything."" And was giggling a bit, the couple also had a baby, and my mom made remarks about if the baby also has these eyes or not, but she couldn't see.

We were in public, and it felt so embarrassing. 

I talk to her like she's a kid, and have to explain the obvious that people have disabilities at times.

She should definitely know, as she's severely overweight with immune disorders and diabetes.

The couple handed the box over to the receptionist and the woman started crying, which was just awful.

My mom had a volunteer, photography job for Easter, it's cool to help, when she called me on the phone all she did was complain and judge the women.

She said all the women were just blonde and had attitude and only cared about getting their lashes and nails done.

My mom gets weird about, women caring about looks, I find it whatever, I want to support other women, as a woman myself. 

My mom is very much ""I'm not like other girls"" because she doesn't wear much makeup or care about fashion, and she mentally assumes that makes her better.

When I was younger, at home- I was very masculine because I felt if I did anything else, it might not be entirely accepted. 

As I've moved out, I really embrace my feminity, and my mom constantly makes remarks about how I'm ""one of these girls"" or something. 

When she was judging these women that she took photos for, I told her ""I would also get lashes and nails done, if I had the money."" and her response was just ""yeah, but you do this stuff differently.""

Then, yesterday we FaceTimed, I had to hang up because she was just so annoying.

She complains 24/7 about my aunt, that's all she talks to me about, and I've repeatedly told her I do not care what my aunt is doing.

For some reason, my mom is obsessed with my aunt.

My aunt is also, slightly crazy- but it's whatever, it's just because my aunt is recently divorced, and is dating / sleeping with a lot of men.

For me, she's a grown adult, it's whatever.

I can understand if my mom is actually concerned, but she never talks about my aunt in a worrisome way, it's more like, can you believe she's doing this? And trash-talking.

My mom is also, ontop of this, extremely weird and conservative about sex. I guess my aunt mentioned having sex-toys, my mom thought this was the peak of disgust, which is frustrating, I'm not crazy myself, but it's healthy to explore aspects of yourself and you don't have to be disgusted by your sexuality.

Anyways, the last aspect, and the most frustrating, is how she acts in groups.

Me and my fiance try to hangout with my parents and make time for them, we get coffee sometimes and try to chat, my dad will make conversation, but my mom does not.

What she does in group settings is:

A) interrupt my dad by touching his arm jokingly, or grab at him.

B) look at me and mimick something to make fun of my dad, like ""oh he talks to much."" 

She also does this when my dad and fiance are talking, to get me to be the same way towards my fiance, like ""oh, men, am I right?"" Vibes, which I find so dumb.

C) just completely ignore the conversation, and start talking about something new- which is always something judgmental or gossip.

Or I'm listening to my dad and fiance, and she completely doesn't pay attention, and then starts to talk to me about random stuff. It's distracting when I'm listening, and annoying. 

And finally, the last issue I've had, is her crying / sobbing, because I brought up hypothetically moving.

My mom's dream would be for us to live right next to her, and she could come visit our kids, whenever we have them, whenever she wants.

Me and my fiance are a bit quieter, and the city we live in now, is very small and there's not much opportunities for us.

This being said, nothing is planned, nothing is happening, my mom asked me first about moving ideas and I said ""oh, we talked about moving here as a thought?"" And she just, basically blew up.

What hurt the most from this, is how she views me, basically. 

We've had this same argument many times before as well, with getting older and moving out- so this reaction isn't new.

While crying she told me ""I have a vision of how I want my life to go, and it's upsetting when it's not happening.""

Her life.

As if I'm not a human with consciousness. This is super frustrating, for me the idea of having kids? They can do whatever they want, it feels like my mom had her kids almost like pets, and is upset when we aren't doing what she wants. She can't fathom us wanting anything else.

All this together, I'm frustrated. 

I want to have a close relationship with her, I don't know how to talk to her about these problems I'm having and try to fix these things, or if they can even be fixed?

I want a close relationship, but I don't want to gossip everytime we talk, my mom just doesn't do anything, nor does she talk about any hobbies or ideas, no movies, TV shows, games, creative ideas, just talking about other people, which is something I actively fight against doing.

1) I felt like there were too many coincidences, firstly with the fact that the flashdrive explaining the AI thing coincidentally fell out of the package that Brandy got in the mail. Then later on, the coffee cup ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù spilled on the computer powering the AI. Now, while you guys might think ‚Äú2 coincidences isn‚Äôt a lot‚Äù it definitely felt like a lot for black mirror cause‚Äô their episode plots are usually amazing and flow super well so I‚Äôm not sure what happened with this one.

2) I‚Äôm gonna be honest I really didn‚Äôt like the actress they chose to play Brandy, I don‚Äôt think she embodied the two roles at all. Basically as you know, in the episode the main actress is playing Brandy, and Brandy is playing Alex, so she‚Äôs basically playing two roles at once, and it didn‚Äôt feel like that at all. It felt like she was just playing Brandy the whole time and it genuinely bothers me because here‚Äôs the thing I understand that even for a seasoned actor it can be hard to switch between roles just like that, but in this specific case it was actually quite easy because all Brandy had to do was put on a transatlantic accent. I also feel like she could‚Äôve delivered certain lines in a way more romantic-sounding way. Like I felt like not only did she not put effort into showcasing Alex as a character by changing her accent, but she also didn‚Äôt deliver her lines in a romantic way so it was very confusing when Dorothy fell in love with her. Like you wouldn‚Äôt really get feelings for someone who has this confused/‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on‚Äù kind of undertone to everything they say. Also there is a point in the episode where she has a bit of a breakdown and ends up going off on Dorothy by saying ‚ÄúI‚ÄôM NOT ALEX AND NONE OF THIS IS REAL‚Äù and I truly feel like this was a missed opportunity because had Brandy been portraying Alex with the accent/charm, then it would‚Äôve made her breakdown so much more powerful and we would‚Äôve gotten to actually see it in real time. But we didn‚Äôt. I will add, just to make this review not seem as negative, I felt like the the actress who played Brandy did a phenomenal job in that last scene where she was holding Dorothy in her arms as she was dying, like that was genuinely such a beautiful scene and she delivered there for sure. I also loved the actress who played Dorothy, she killed that role.

Feel free to let me know what you guys think about my critiques, but try to keep it respectful. If you saw the episode and really liked it then that‚Äôs fine. Me disliking it is not an attack on you, it‚Äôs just my opinion.",1,1745129696.0,blackmirror,8,0.53,False

I'm starting up a food truck, it's got a decent sized hot plate, and gas grill, fridge, freezer plus a coffee machine.

Trying to come up with a nice menu but also something easy and quick to prepare while I get the hang of things! 
So far I've got 

- pulled beef burgers 
- Nachos
- Bacon & Egg English muffins 

What are some foods that you'd love to see in a food truck??",0,1745129682.0,AskCulinary,2,0.4,False
