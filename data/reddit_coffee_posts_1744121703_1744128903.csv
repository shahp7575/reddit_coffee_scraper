This post doesnt reflect my views on autism overall, only the paper it plays in our situation. If you're uncomfortable with people discussing autism harshly I recommend you dont read further for your own good.

SORRY SUPER LONG POST GOSHHH I JUST HAVE TO STATE EVERYTHING SO YOU UNDERSTAND ME 😭

Also mandatory message: I don't think my sister is a monster and I think she can change. I know this post is basically to talk badly about here but I would like to be heard. Thank you

We're three siblings, my sister is 25, was diagnosed as an adult about 2y ago. My brother is 20 and he's also autistic but he was diagnosed young so we've known our whole life and we've seen his struggles and other people could tell at times that he was autistic and he has learnt and developed as a person. So even tho he has needs, obviously, we are used to them and he has done a lot of efforts to get better at ""functioning in life"" and props to him. Because sometimes, you have to accept that it's very different to change the whole world to adapt to yourself. It's also wrong to say you have to change the way you are for others, but in some situations, you just have to. It's hard and I've had to do it too even tho I'm not diagnosed with anything.

Now onto my sister. She has always been a troublemaker but with her diagnosis it all got worse. She keeps saying she's made progress by going to therapy, but the entire family has only seen her become even a worse person. If anyone says she is a bad person, because she is, she is terrible, she is manipulative and narcissistic, she will say that WE are the bad guys because she's only like that because we haven't adjusted to her needs.

So why do we say she's a terrible person? She cant let us live in peace. She will explode at anything. Even something like my father preparing a salad or the coffee ""incorrectly"", or other relatives not driving like SHE thinks is the correct way to drive or whatever... Theres a lot of stupid situations so its impossible to list them all out.

When our divorced father got a girlfriend, my sister didnt let her come to our home. All because my father presented the girlfriend to us on my sister's birthday. What's so wrong about that? Obviously a bday is THE special day for the person celebrating, and my dad wanted his gf to be a part of this, because it's normal for second partners to become part of the family eventually.

But after that day my sister got so mad, any time dad's gf came even if it was just for dinner, because she did everything to make it impossible for the gf to stay the night, so eventually the gf saw my sister's bad side and discussed with my dad that she wasn't comfortable going to our home anymore which GIRL SAME..

This is important because fast forward about 4 years, my sister idk how gets a boyfriend, a boyfriend that is being psychologically abused btw, and being treated like a maid, I'll get to that later... And the boyfriend ends up living in our home. (Because my sister previously was SO TRAUMATIZED with ""us"", that she moved to boyfriend's home with his parents, but she lasted 2 months because bf's parents didnt stand her bullshit either, tho she wont say that lol, she says they ""had differences"").

So clearly even tho we all think the bf is a good person, and my dad is okay with him living in our home,but  my dad cant help but bring up the fact that his own girlfriend was denied of stepping a foot into the house but suddenly when it's about my sister's life, sister's bf can just straight up COME LIVE there.

Me and my dad say that the boyfriend is being mentally abused because well, he has to stand my fucking psycho sister 24/7 and she is very demanding. She will be enclosed in their bedroom and if she wants something she tells the bf to go get it. If she's mentally tired she will ask him to clean the floor and/or kitchen.. Okay, little things right? Anyone could ask for those favours. But let's see further: When she is SO angry at us that she doesnt wanna speak to us, she sends her slave boyfriend to talk to us as if he was a messenger dove. His fulltime job is like being my sister's unconditional defender. Anything we say she did wrong, he has excuses for it, as she also has for herself. She will scream at him when he does the littlest mistake possible, or things that are not even mistakes. She does the same with us, too.

Little friendly reminder that even though I'm really mad at her, I think she can change, and I miss those days in childhood where we could actually be siblings doing things together. I just dont see the end of it

We (dad and I) have talked many times with the bf both in private and with sister listening from another room, saying that it's not, in any way, okay for her to treat him, and us, like fucking shit all the time. We tell him that her autism is not an excuse. Because here's the main problem ti all of this, She blames her autism for everything. When she does something bad, which is cinstantly, its either an autistic behaviour or the result of US not tending to her necessities.

We have told both sister and slave boyfriend that sometimes, what she demands, even if it is her absolute necessity as an autistic person, is impossible for us to achieve, because we are human too and not robots. One of the things is that she wanna keep an exact schedule. Which I think is great! But our life is not constructed in a way that allows us to give her exactly the schedule she needs. For example, dad gets home late and tired, and has to cook, and usually dinner is late, like at 10pm. I also feel like thats late but its what it is. We tell sister that if she wants, she can follow her own schedule, she can have dinner at 8pm, she knows how to cook and enjoys it. Another one of her demands is that she doesnt like us coming in and out of the house every week.

Explanation: divorced parents, each kid is living between mom and dad houses in different time intervals, so that bothers my sister.

Which I would usually understand, because I KNOW people with autism need to have everything really planned and follow a schedule. But the days/weeks that each of us are in that home(dad's) or mom's, IS in itself a schedule that has been going on for over 2 or 3 years, so shouldnt she be used to it at least a bit?

Back onto the discussion of her necessities, me and dad told sister and bf that obviously the multiple people being home in different days thing can't change or doesn't have a solution right now because our situation as a separated family is already complicated and we deserve the right to see all our family members as equally as possible. But.... she won't understand that either. She just keeps alluding, not directly saying, that it's her necessity for us to not live there at all? Lol. She has told me that I don't have the RIGHT to live in my DAD's house (the house I, and we, have all always lived in before the divorce). It's like she has appropiated the house for herself and the boyfriend.

Our aunt also lives two streets away and because of her submissive nature, my sister is even harsher with her. I feel like crying everytime I see my sister screaming at our aunt and telling her she is fucking useless and insulting her and belittling (i think thats the word) her. My aunt has told me she is trying to learn to say no and be stronger.

Idk where to add this so I'm adding it here in the middle: Me and dad think she has way more things going on than autism. Either she has always had a bad temper and now has autism to defend herself, or she has autism AND one of the mental illnesses or disorders that actually cause this terrible manipulative behaviour.

When we talked with slave boyfriend, which I havent mentioned, refuses to see he's in an abusive relationship, we've explained to him that us ""neurotypicals"" also have needs, we're also human and we have feelings, and we make mistakes, and we do great things, and we can have the same problems or issues as ""neurodivergent"" people (hot take here, neurodivergent and typical is not blakc and white, its a spectrum, just like im saying in this paragraph, hate me all you want), an example is me having been socially anxious all my life, having the cant look at the eyes issue, ending up in therapy cause I felt really useless after graduating because I was too nervous to even apply for jobs or going to interviews. my dad also gave some examples about his life. Just us telling them that everyone has their own problems, and just because you're in a bad place mentally, doesn't justify you treatung everyone around you like shit and like an abuser and saying you are the victim cause we don't do what you demand.

All of this is taking a toll on our mental health but apparently we are not allowed to suffer, and we are not suffering, only the autistic girlie here is the one who has it worse, according to her. I'm just so tired of everything. I hate to see my dad being the one who take most part of this problem. He has mentioned many times, after big incidents, how he thought about death. He thought, what's the meaning of life, having a daughter that doesn't let you live your life? But I know my father would never do that. Still, I do know he is super affected mentally and I've cried alone in silence for him.

Every time me and my brother have fun doing a normal acitvity, or even myself with my dad, me asking him how to make something with wood, us talking about tv shows we've both watched, enjoying little moments happily.... I can \*feel\* that maybe, she doesn't like us being happy, and she wants us to be all grumpy because if she's not enjoying life, no one around her is allowed to enjoy it either.

I didn't even go into how our autistic brother doesn't do what sister does. Oh, and did you know sister's boyfriend is also autistic? The last ones to be diagnosed are my dad and I... I would pnt be surprised...

The basic idea is that a stream from sufficient height causes greater agitation that ""avalanches"" grounds from top to bottom and around, so giving more contact time and extraction.

It makes sense, but much of it is based on a model using silica particles imaged using a laser system. This may or may not fully reflect the effects on ground coffee. Also the cone they use is plugged, so there is no through-flow during the imaging experiment - so more like a closed Switch or other hybrid brewer than a V60. The final part uses real coffee and V60 and measures the TDS - does seem to support their idea.",2,1744128653.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

The last 4 straight meetings between these two squads have seen less than 214 points, friends. In addition, Brooklyn hasn’t put more than 115 points on the board in their last 10 straight games (and they only managed to reach that 115-point benchmark one time in those 10!) On the other side, the Pelicans are far from being a high-scoring juggernaut, banking no more than 108 points in their last 5 outings. And perhaps the most important piece of today's puzzle? It’s looking like both teams are without their top scorers this evening. To be frank, I’ll be surprised if this encounter cracks 205. I’m on the Under to cash.

1juhcbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1juhcbk/is_it_normal_for_people_to_consider_the_style_of/,Is it normal for people to consider the style of a uniform at work a dealbreaker?,"I’m an employee at a resort restaurant and have been for nearly six years now (im a 27-year-old woman btw).  Everyone in the restaurant wears the same uniform, with exceptions being the managers and the host/hostess.  Our restaurant also manages our resort’s main coffee shop, so the uniform is basically the same, but with an apron added to the attire.

I’m not a fashion expert and I’ve never really cared all that much about what qualifies as “in style.”  I’ve only ever cared about colors and being comfortable.  Our uniforms have always had a “modest” style, so they aren’t tight or revealing in any way.  The only time they ever were was when my top, a button up, would be so tight around my chest that buttons popping out was a common issue for me.  They finally switched the shirts so the buttons were under a layer of fabric.  I’ve heard coworkers, both younger and older than me, call our style “old fashioned” or “dated,” but I never really understood what they meant or why they took it seriously.  There’s not really much we can say or do about the uniform style since that decision is made by the wife of the resort’s owner.  Unless it was proven the uniform violated our family friendly environment or cause actual health troubles for employees, they’re rarely changed.

So the reason I’m here is because recently, we got new uniforms for summer season and some of my coworkers are acting really weird about it.  It’s basically the same uniform as always but a few things are different.

1.  The shirt has short sleeves, has a darker color and lighter fabric, and is button down but hidden with fabric so stretching buttons aren’t easy to notice.  The shirt’s fabric isn’t super breathable, which can be difficult when we get busy, but it’s still kind of comfortable in my opinion.  

2. We have to wear a “military belt” which looks like a flat rope with a very shiny and complex clasp that according to my dad (a Navy Veteran) is prone to scratching easily.  The scratching is going to be hard to avoid and I’m considering putting invisible tape over the buckle to keep it safe.

3. Hostesses have this black “wrap around” dress that feels and looks like a robe, because it’s kept together with a strap that wraps around and through the dress.  There’s supposedly going to be an undershirt added on later since they didn’t notice until after ordering the dresses that the chest is partially exposed.  I hate this thing and I don’t get why hosts even need a uniform, but at least it’s not insanely short and the fabric is stretchy and soft.

4. We have new aprons for our coffee shop, which are black and are long.  I comes up half way to your neck and all the way down paste your waist.  In my case, the apron reaches past my knees since I’m very short and clothing brands hate me.  I eagerly wait for the day an upper manager sees me wearing it because I look like I’m wearing a dress.

5.  They’re forcing us to wear these khaki pants that are, in my opinion, the worst pair of pants I’ve ever worn.  Not only is the fabric 100% unbreathable, they fit really weirdly around your bottom half, are really tight around the waist, and have a grand total of two buttons, a zipper, and a metal clasp to keep the barn door closed.  Why the heck do we even need all that security anyway?

TL;DR: They have old styles, they are strange, and they’re a typical uniform meant to be appropriate for all ages and apparently also prevent employees from modifying their uniform so it looks more…sexy I guess?  Apparently this has been an ongoing problem in other departments and I seriously don’t understand why or how.

Anyway, it’s been a common topic of complaint at work over the past couple weeks, but two of my coworkers see it as more than that.  It’s not just a uniform, it’s their last straw.  One of them (24F) told me she actually cried in the bathroom because the uniforms looked ugly and she’s looking for other jobs because she hates them.  My other coworker, who’s also her sister (18F) said she doesn’t like the apron being so high and is also considering other employment.  It’s just bizarre to me because we’ve been through far worse before and yet a uniform looking old fashioned is the breaking point.  I’d understand a little if they were forced to wear the hostess uniform, but nope.  It’s just the normal shirt and khakis with the belt that’s the problem.

I don’t know exactly why fashion is such a big deal here.  I doubt people would actually make fun of you for your uniform and even if they did, why would you care all that much?  If all your coworkers are wearing the same uniform the exact same way, then what’s the problem?  That energy would make more sense if it were directed at the resort, considering they’re the ones enforcing the dress code, not us.  The whole purpose of a uniform is to make the establishment look professional, not make us look hot, right?

I’d actually understand if we were being forced to wear bikinis against our will, but this is the exact opposite. 

Is this a common thing in jobs that require uniforms?  Do people typically leave or refuse jobs because they don’t like the style of a uniform?  ",0,1744128573.0,NoStupidQuestions,2,0.33,False
1juhc1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNikah/comments/1juhc1a/online_haram_relationship_confusion_and_guilt/,"online haram ""relationship""  - confusion and guilt","Salaam, my brothers and sisters in Islam, I wanted to ask for any possible duas/advice that would be suitable for my situation because I am so lost after getting blocked by a haram “relationship”. 

I posted on tiktok, and a guy commented under my post to refrain from using music and avoid music, and I went on his account and liked his content (he gave dawah and duas) and liked 1 or 2 of his posts, idk if he took it as a sign of interest bc he then started liking my posts after I would post too, (we didn't follow each other and i'm not a popular tik toker, i've only posted my face once which is where he found my tiktok from because it went a little viral). 

My content was scenery, goals, and coffee- just for fun. Eventually we followed each other on tiktok and started talking. I asked him what his intentions were for talking to me and he said marriage, and I told him I need time to get to know him but that we’re both on the same page. We constantly talked for very little days, and he gave me signs of attachment. 

But I didn’t need to talk everyday, to avoid further haram, and he didn’t reach out either, so after we ended a conversation one night, we did not talk for three days (especially because I had exams), and I checked after those three days and I had gotten blocked by him. This led to confusion and hurt, that am I not even worth an explanation? I thought how could he be the one to set such a huge intention and then BLOCK ME without even explaining why. It led to thoughts of what trait I could lack that one could just set such a serious intention and then block me without explaining. Was I being toyed with, or was it a fault within me? 

I genuinely liked him but I would've been much less hurt if he changed his mind and told me why instead of just blocking. Anyways, two months later, aka now, he had posted a story on his instagram after making it public, and although we exchanged instas we never followed each other. Ofc i was curious so from my spam account that doesn't say my name or trace back to me, i viewed the story. Immediately, he texted my acc asking who I am, assuming that I am a prank caller bc apparently he was trying to catch some girls prank calling him. 

I convinced him I am not the prank caller and it took a while because he kept questioning, then we started talking again for two days straight. He had many questions about who I am and jokingly bantered too. I thought he knew I was a girl, but turns out he didn't. After we established I am a girl, he continued bantering for like five minutes and even continuously asking my age which I thought was a little odd but then he said “we can't be talking then if you're a girl.” 

We said our salams and he blocked me, which is what I wanted because that automatically blocks my other accounts so I don’t search him up. Then, I changed my ig account name to where we talked, to my name. Few minutes later, he deactivated. Then it hit me that it wasn't a fault in me that he blocked me, but a greatness in him. It was his trust in Allah swt and closeness to Him that made him block me, and now probably feels guilty for talking to a girl and deactivated as a break. I feel horrible now, because I feel like I caused him religious guilt not meaning to, and now the guilt from THAT and the fact that I talked to him in itself is eating me up. 

I do not talk to men even when they have intentions for marriage, but I only reciprocated interest in him, completely online. However, haram is haram and I must admit I sinned by talking to the opposite gender, and influenced him to it. I will not reach out to him again though I am sorry.  I always pray for a future partner like this one, who doesn’t talk to women and I do the same, however I faltered this time. My heart feels heavy and filled with guilt for not trusting Allah swt enough and just so many other unexplainable feelings. 

I have no idea what to do, how to cope, if anyone has any similar experience, duas, ayahs, or advice, I would love to read it and am hoping for your responses.",1,1744128553.0,MuslimNikah,0,1.0,False

1juhbil,https://i.redd.it/hk0r8cbjxmte1.jpeg,"For months, my daily tarot readings were telling me that in order to find my “calling”, I needed to combine my passion with my creativity. I’m so glad I listened!","As a stay at home mom, I really wanted to find ways to help contribute financially. For years, I felt absolutely lost. I thought that I had no real talent, just a handful of things that I was kind of good at. I know a lot of people are extremely skeptical about things like tarot readings, but they have been a part of my daily routine for many years now and have never steered me wrong. All throughout the majority of 2023 through the beginning of 2024, my cards kept insisting that in order to find my calling, I was supposed to harness my creativity and put it towards my passion. The only problem was that I had no idea what my passion really was, nor did I feel like I had much creativity. Sure, I enjoy a lot of things… coffee, reading, cozy video games, etc., but I wasn’t about to write a book or teach myself coding. I was frustrated, but time and time again, the cards were insistent. 

It wasn’t until early March 2024, that I had an epiphany. I had just received an order in the mail of some really cool artisan perfumes that I had been eyeing for a while. I left the perfumes on my counter at home, and then left to pick up my daughter from school. On the drive to her school, I had the biggest “lightbulb” moment of my life. I have ALWAYS, for as long as I can remember, had a huge passion for fragrance… Whether it be perfume, candles, incense, you name it, I love it. I’m the person who can’t walk past a candle display without stopping to smell them all. I knew without a shadow of a doubt, right there in that moment, that I was supposed to craft and sell perfumes. Not only that, But I knew that I would set myself apart by offering completely custom perfumes.

Here I am a year later, and it has taken off more than I ever imagined it would. $8.9k in 13 months may not seem like much, but considering my most expensive item is only $25 and I’m making each and every one to order, I’m pretty impressed with myself! I have crafted well over 400 custom fragrances, complete with a custom label to fit the vibe. I allow the customer to name their fragrance themselves for the label I make, or they can leave it up to me. I have SO MANY repeat customers! My reviews often bring tears to my eyes because it’s such wonderful confirmation that I’m doing what I’m meant to do. I feel blessed every single day that I get to do something I absolutely love, and contribute financially to my family in the meantime 💕

If there’s a better sub for this let me know! We have a very small kitchen and are far off from being able to remodel it but we plan to in the future. 

In the meantime, to hold us over, I want to buy a few items to maximize the tiny space but it’s such an oddly organized kitchen especially with the doorways, AC floor vents etc. 

I have a few ideas:
1. A small island/cabinet to go under the shelves where we can set up the coffee/tea station and have additional storage. This will partially block a small hallway that leads to three spaces (laundry porch, bedroom, and door leading to the second story).
2. Buy a larger pantry/hutch that has a counter. It would partially obstruct the vent but I think there’s vent extenders??? Anything too wide will block the entry into the kitchen from the dining room.
3. I can take down the shelves or possibly move them and put a larger pantry/hutch in that area instead.

I plan to also add possibly a lazy Susan to the corner cabinet but any other tips are appreciated!

1juh6hy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1juh6hy,Caffeine and iron absorption,"Just have to share with others incase it can help someone else! I have had low ferritin for awhile. I've gotten testing every few years since around 2010. Lowest was 4 and highest 20. I know, I should have taken this more seriously but I love to eat plant based and I do not like taking iron supplements. 

I would introduce red meat into my diet when my symptoms got worse probably a couple times a month and it would help but never seemed to be able to get ferritin higher than 20. 

Almost 3 months ago I got off caffeine. Mind you, I wouldn't drink caffeine around meals ever. I'd always have it in the morning hours before my first meal and I was still irons deficient. 

So for the last three months, I cut all out all caffeine including coffee, matcha or chocolate. I was having hair loss, extreme fatigue, word finding difficulties, stress, chest pain etc. You know, all those low iron symptoms we go through. 

I haven't had blood work in a few years but was feeling rough; not knowing if it was caffeine withdrawal or someone else, one month after I stopped caffeine I got blood work done and my ferritin was 13. Iron deficiency without anemia. 

I started having red meat a few times a week and 2 months later now my ferritin is up to 39. No supplents whatsoever.

I have never seen it that high, ever. 

Im convinced that caffeine doesnt just effect absorption around meals, I think it inhabits absorption continually though out the day. Of course this is ancedotal and I haven't read many published studies on it but just found it fascinating!!

I hope this helps encourage others who want to raise their iron levels. 

I will say the long term withdrawals from caffeine were rough (I was having around 2-3shots of espresso in my latte in the morning). But if you need support check out the /decaf Reddit thread. It's helped so much! 

Be well everyone there's hope!

Well now it’s happening outside of my period. Now it’s like if I take the pill in the morning in any distress, it takes a pin drop to set me off on an all encompassing day ruining spiral. If my toddler happens to be struggling that morning, I’m a mess and yelling. If my husband wakes up depressed, I take the pill and lose my shit over everything he says.

This is awful and I’m sure a med switch or dosage adjustment or whatever is needed, but I am terrified it will be worse on something else. I have never taken a stimulant before because of being undiagnosed. I thought it would make me just go insane when ironically it probably would have dramatically changed the trajectory of my life because of an earlier diagnosis but who knows, hindsight and all. 

Anyways I’m just searching for advice. Idk what to do here, I know I can call my provider but she doesn’t provide much feedback and my insurance is well limiting. I want this to help but need an alternative to this mood monster chaos I am experiencing.

2. Replace the open pantry with a larger/wider pantry/hutch perhaps with a counter. This will partially/fully block the vent but I think there are vent extenders??

I recently picked up a pair of Mōshn shoes and wanted to share how they’ve been for me. I’d heard they’re great for busy folks like me—always running between work, errands, and home stuff. Here’s my real, unbiased take after wearing them for a while.

The comfort is a big plus. I put them on, and there was no break-in hassle. They’ve got this Dynamic Motion Technology in the **outsole** that makes walking feel smooth. My feet didn’t hurt after long days, which is awesome since I’m always standing.

The arch support is solid too—it’s like my feet get constant support. I also like the SmartKnit material. It’s **water-resistant** and washes easily. I spilled coffee once, and they cleaned up with no stains—huge win!

But there are downsides. The sizing felt off—I got my usual size, and they were tight at first. I’d say size up if you’re unsure. The price is steep too. They seem well-made, but it’s a lot to spend.

The color I got didn’t match the website either. It wasn’t a huge deal, but it bugged me. And they’re not great for intense stuff like running—too little bounce for that.

Here’s a quick rundown:

**Pros:**

* Comfy from day one
* Good arch support
* Easy to clean
* Stylish enough for daily wear

**Cons:**

* Sizing feels small
* Pretty expensive
* Colors might differ from pics
* Not built for high-energy activities

I like them for casual days—they help my feet on busy schedules. But they’re not flawless. If you want comfy daily shoes, they might work—just check sizing and cost first!

I might be the last person who saw him.,"I work at a pretty average office. Cubicles, crappy coffee, passive-aggressive emails — you know the type. I (28M) don’t usually get involved in office drama, but last week something happened that I can’t stop thinking about.

My coworker, Tyler (30M), was a quiet guy. Not shy, just… reserved. He always wore the same gray hoodie, brought the same lunch every day (PB&J, a banana, and a can of Sprite), and sat at the same desk by the window. We’d chat occasionally, nothing deep. Just stuff like, “Mondays suck,” or “The printer’s jammed again.”

Last Thursday, around noon, I saw him heating up a frozen burrito in the break room — which already threw me off because Tyler never switched up his lunch. I joked about it, and he smiled a little, then said something I can’t shake:

“It’s my last meal here. Might as well switch it up.”

I thought he meant he was quitting or something. I asked him what he meant, and he just shook his head and said, “You’ll see.”

After that, I didn’t see him for the rest of the day. His stuff was still at his desk — hoodie draped over the chair, half-finished Sprite on the table. But no Tyler.

The next day, our manager sent out a weirdly vague email saying Tyler had taken “unexpected leave.” HR wouldn’t give details. By Monday, his desk was cleared out.

Here’s the thing that’s been messing with me: I went to toss out some trash that Friday afternoon and noticed his burrito — the one he’d been heating — still in the microwave. Untouched. Like he never came back to get it.

No one else mentioned it. Not a word. It’s like he just… evaporated.

I tried messaging him — no reply. I even looked him up online. His LinkedIn is gone. Social media wiped clean. It’s like he never existed.

And now weird stuff is happening. I got an envelope in my mailbox at work today. No return address. Inside? A single piece of paper with just five words on it:

“Don’t eat the burrito.”

I have no idea what any of this means. I didn’t tell anyone. I don’t even know if I should. But I can’t stop thinking about Tyler’s face when he said “You’ll see.”

Maybe I already have.

And about five minutes later, he asked me to come back and my heart sunk into my chest. I didn’t want to at first, I was so scared just of any pain, however minuscule, I might encounter. But I took it one step at a time and he kept me calm when I did freak out a bit (not screaming or kicking, just breathing really fast like as if I’m having a panic attack) feeling the anesthetic needle go in both times. What took about 20 minutes felt like an eternity. But after we were done, he gave me some water and let me sit by myself for a few minutes before I got up and took my paperwork and limped back to my car. But a few months later, I went to a lab and my results came back with 0 swimmers. 

Like I said, I’m so glad I went through with it. My desire for kids and starting a family has always been low. I just want to be loved by a woman and be able to experience that intimacy without fear of any life altering repercussions for either of us. ",6,1744127627.0,Vasectomy,0,1.0,False

Enter positive affirmations—those little pep talks you give yourself—and binaural beats, the intriguing soundscapes that might just supercharge them. Science suggests affirmations can boost your self-esteem, ease anxiety, and even improve performance. Add binaural beats, with their knack for relaxing your mind, and you’ve got a combo worth exploring. In this post, we’ll unpack the research, dive into how these two might team up, and show you how to try it yourself—maybe even with a little help from [Binaural Beats Factory](https://binauralbeatsfactory.com). Ready to unlock your potential?

## What Are Positive Affirmations?

Positive affirmations are short, uplifting statements like “I am capable” or “I embrace challenges,” designed to overwrite negative thoughts. Think of them as mental rewiring—repeating them builds belief over time. Research backs this up with some impressive findings:

- **Boosted Self-Esteem**: A [2015 study in the Journal of Positive Psychology](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2015.1088052) found that regular affirmations lift self-esteem, especially for those starting with low self-worth. It’s like giving your brain a confidence upgrade via the medial prefrontal cortex.
- **Less Stress and Anxiety**: A [2018 meta-analysis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2018.1484940) showed affirmations reduce anxiety and depression symptoms, with effects ranging from small to moderate (0.25-0.35). Not a magic fix, but a solid step toward calm.
- **Better Performance**: Athletes using affirmations saw a 12% bump in reaction times, per a [2007 study in the Journal of Applied Sport Psychology](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10413200701598988). Less mental clutter, more motivation—sounds like a win.

These perks make affirmations a go-to for mental well-being, whether you’re facing a tough day or chasing a goal.

## What Are Binaural Beats?

Picture this: you pop on headphones, and two slightly different frequencies—say, 200 Hz in one ear, 205 Hz in the other—blend in your brain to create a 5 Hz “beat.” That’s a binaural beat, and it’s thought to nudge your brainwaves into specific states. Here’s what the science says:

- **Relaxation Station**: A [2014 study in Complementary Therapies in Medicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096522991400076X) found theta-frequency beats (4-8 Hz) boosted alpha brainwaves, linked to relaxation, with participants feeling 15% chiller than those hearing white noise.
- **Focus Boost**: Beta-frequency beats (13-30 Hz) cut error rates by 10% in attention tasks, according to a [2017 study in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00300/full). Perfect for when you need to lock in.
- **Anxiety Relief**: Listening to delta beats (0.5-4 Hz) before stress dropped anxiety by 26%, per a [2017 study in Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5478334/). A pre-game calm-down trick worth trying.

Skeptics argue some effects might be placebo, but the relaxation angle? That’s got legs—and it might just pair perfectly with affirmations.

## Why Combine Affirmations with Binaural Beats?

Here’s where it gets interesting: what if binaural beats could make affirmations hit harder? While direct studies are thin, the logic tracks. Relaxation makes you more suggestible—think hypnosis, where you chill out before the suggestions sink in. A [2015 study in Stress and Health](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.2656) found relaxed folks were 20% more receptive to suggestions. If binaural beats can ease you into that sweet spot, affirmations might stick better.

Imagine theta beats lulling your mind while “I am enough” loops in the background. The combo could deepen the message, blending science with a bit of DIY brain magic. No hard proof yet, but the pieces fit—relaxation plus repetition could amplify affirmations’ effects on self-esteem, stress, or focus. Plus, it’s low-risk—worst case, you get a soothing audio break.

## The Science Behind the Synergy

Let’s break it down:

- **Affirmations Alone**: They rewire thought patterns, backed by studies showing brain activity shifts in self-processing areas. Consistent use matters—think daily doses for weeks.
- **Binaural Beats Alone**: They tweak brainwaves, with theta for calm, beta for focus, and delta for anxiety relief. Effects vary—some feel it fast, others need time.
- **Together?**: A relaxed brain (thanks, binaural beats) might soak up affirmations more readily. The [Stress and Health study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smi.2656) hints at this, showing relaxation ups suggestibility. It’s not a slam dunk, but it’s a promising hunch.

Individual mileage varies—some might find beats distracting—but the potential for a one-two punch of calm and confidence is there. More research would seal the deal, but for now, it’s a solid “maybe” worth testing.

## How to Try It Yourself

Ready to give it a shot? Here’s a simple plan:

1. **Pick Your Affirmations**: Keep them short and personal—“I am strong,” “I stay calm under pressure.” Say them like you mean it.
2. **Choose Your Beats**: Theta (4-8 Hz) for relaxation, beta (13-30 Hz) for focus. Headphones are a must—stereo splits the frequencies.
3. **Set the Scene**: Find a quiet spot, 10-20 minutes daily. Morning or bedtime works best.
4. **DIY Audio**: Record your affirmations over binaural beats. Or, try [Binaural Beats Factory’s AI-Powered Subliminal/Affirmation Audio Generator](https://binauralbeatsfactory.com/ai-powered-subliminal-affirmation-audio-creation/)—input your affirmations, pick a frequency, and get a custom track. Their [Self-Hypnosis Generator](https://binauralbeatsfactory.com) can also mix relaxation with your affirmations for a deeper vibe.
5. **Experiment**: Start with a week. Notice how you feel—calmer? More confident? Tweak as needed.

**Pro tip**: Don’t listen while driving—binaural beats can be too relaxing. Safety first!

## Practical Tips for Success

- **Consistency is Key**: Like any habit, daily practice builds results. Pair it with coffee or winding down.
- **Personalize It**: Affirmations hit harder when they’re “you.” “I ace presentations” beats generic fluff.
- **Volume Matters**: Keep affirmations audible but soft, letting beats hum in the background.
- **Mix Frequencies**: Try theta for stress, beta for work. [Binaural Beats Factory](https://binauralbeatsfactory.com) lets you tailor tracks to your goals.
- **Track Progress**: Jot down mood or focus shifts. It’s your experiment—see what sticks.

## Wrapping Up: Your Mind, Your Power

Positive affirmations can lift your self-esteem, cut stress, and sharpen your game—science says so. Binaural beats bring relaxation, focus, and anxiety relief to the table. Together? They might just amplify each other, with beats setting the stage for affirmations to shine. While we’re still waiting on direct studies, the logic—and early evidence—suggests it’s worth a try.

Why not test it out? Tools like [Binaural Beats Factory’s audio generators](https://binauralbeatsfactory.com) make it easy to craft your own tracks, blending affirmations with beats tailored to your vibe. Start small, tweak as you go, and see if this duo unlocks something new in you. Got thoughts or results to share? Drop them below—I’d love to hear how it works for you!

1jugta3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsychologyTalk/comments/1jugta3/mental_energy_and_its_metaphors/,Mental energy and its metaphors,"    Lately, I've been trying to understand mental energy. In this piece, I look at the metaphors we use to make sense of it. Beware that these are my own personal musings. I am NOT a licenced anything. If you find any errors, or have ANY thought on anything related to mental energy, please share!

# Mental energy and its metaphors

The industrial revolution made us see ourselves as machines. The Mechanical Philosophy likened the entire universe to a grand mechanism, and not just in a metaphorical sense—vivisection was defended on the ground that animals were simply automations with no more feelings than any clockwork. Due to the Time is Money metaphor, our time is seen as a monetary resource; we “simply don’t have enough time,” we “*spend* time together,” or we’re “*wasting* our time”, or that so-called shortcut “*cost* us an hour”. We talk about “deprogramming” and “human resources”. We talk about our ability to “multitask”, a term coined in the 1960s to describe a computer’s ability to process different tasks seemingly at once.

Today, “energy” is the go-to metaphor for our mental “energy”. The metaphor of seeing ourselves as a machine running on some sort of energy source is so predominant that it is hard to talk about it without using that metaphor itself. We think of our sensation of tiredness as a lack of energy—we’re “running on empty”, “out of steam,” “burnt out,” the opposite of being “energized” or “revved up”.

The Danish language has the compound noun Mentalt Overskud (“Mental Surplus”) which refers to the mental energy currently available. It is typically spoken of as a lack, as in “I know I should have called him back, but I simply didn’t have the mental surplus”.

When humans dabbled in introspectrum in ancient times, the drainage of gasoline or batteries were obviously not a common mental image. Instead, people saw themselves as getting their juices from spirits or from God himself.

Spirits are a kind of pixie elf thing, of course, but it originates from the Latin *spiritus* (“a breath, a breathing”). Likewise, the word “inspired” comes from Latin *inspirare* (“to breathe or blow into”) suggesting that some higher forces rejuvenate us with their breath, making us ""In high spirits"".

*Enchanted* means profoundly fascinated, but also being inhabited or possessed by elves or other *spirits*. It shares this double meaning with the Scandinavian *Bjergtaget* which means fascinated, but also literally bjergtaget, “taken to the mountains” by the trolls, similar to the phrase *away with the fairies*. The word *enthusiasm* takes it even further, meaning being “*inspired* or possessed by a god”.

This idea of being spirited by something above us may be linked to the height metaphor. We’re in high spirits,  reeved up, elevated, on a height, lifting their spirits, exalted, buoyant, or maybe we’ve taken uppers. This is also seen in the negative; we’re on an all-time low, hitting rock bottom, going down, a downer.

But whether we see ourselves as being energized by spirits or AAA-batteries, both metaphors share the idea of our spirit and energy being a thing, as opposite to when we’re exhausted and drained and thus don’t have that thing.

But is it a thing, really? Let’s take a look at coffee. This popular drink is said to give you energy. We say that it is a “stimulant”, a class of drugs which “increase awareness (...) enhancing attention, motivation, cognition, mood, and physical performance.” or at least, that’s what Wikipedia claims. So this seems to fit with the energy metaphor. Coffee increase and enhance stuff, thus being that thing we metaphorically see as spirits or AAA-batteries.

But does coffee actually do that? Luckily, we have serious science folks doing coffee science. Coffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant. It doesn’t *increase* or *enhance* anything. The only thing it does is that it *suppresses* our adenosine receptors by blocking them. Adenosine is being released throughout the day, and functions as our circadian rhythms measurement of when it is time for some shut-eye.

So coffee doesn’t give us energy as such. What it does is block our ability to sense how tired we are. The blocking of the adenosine receptors has the nice side-effect of firing other neurotransmitters (dophamine, adrenaline), so admittedly it is a bit of both. But when we think of coffee as something which “gives us energy,” we envision something other than that it blocks our adenosine receptors. So the energy metaphor takes a life of its own, clouding what is actually happening.",1,1744127269.0,PsychologyTalk,0,1.0,False

*   **Add a pinch of espresso powder:** This enhances the chocolate flavor and adds depth.

I feel a bit silly posting this but I’ve never experienced this before and it really honestly scared me a lot. Thank you in advance. 

(Also I take an SNRI daily but it has never interfered with alcohol in the past.)

What happened: I had just started my period yesterday. All day I didn’t really drink any water lol, just one cup of coffee. Before going out I ate a bunch of left over chicken wings. I went out for drinks with friends in the evening and had like four or five which is a lot for me and was pretty drunk but not ridiculously drunk. I’ve been worse before! Nothing unusual. My bf drove me home, I drank some water, then we went to bed. 

I got up in the middle of the night to pee and was sitting on the toilet when I suddenly broke out into a freezing cold sweat and my heart started POUNDING in this horrible way that I’d never felt before. I’ve felt my heart pound before but not like this. I tried to breathe but it felt like I couldn’t breathe deep enough and I got overcome with dizziness and weakness, my vision got weird and I felt so weak I couldn’t move. Finally I got up, trying to get to the bedroom. My heart kept pounding so hard and the dizziness got worse and worse and I was stumbling down the hall holding onto the walls then next thing I remember, my body is smashing full force into the floor in the hallway. I had just passed out cold. and my bf ran out and saw me lying there unconscious. I opened my eyes like as soon as I hit the floor and sat up dazed. He was talking to me but I couldn’t answer for some reason. I remember I crawled back to the toilet (I was in a state of like shock or confusion) and I projectile vomited into it without knowing I was even nauseous. immediately after vomiting I had diarrhea and then WHILE that was happening my heart began pounding again and I got the same dizziness and briefly lost consciousness. Then after diarrhea was over I lay on the bathroom floor because I was too weak to move and my entire body was covered in ice cold sweat like literally dropping off my face and my whole body was SHAKING and I was so weak i couldn’t get up. And weirdly my shoulders and neck were aching horribly. Then things subsided while I was sitting there and I eventually got back up to go to bed and felt so much better but my body kept trembling for hours in bed. 

I assume this is extreme dehydration?? But what gives me pause is the literal fainting and losing consciousness twice. And the insane combination of other things I have NEVER had before! That has NEVER happened to me before even if I am completely wasted and haven’t had any water or food. This is just the first time this combination of insanity has happened to me and it freaked me out so badly and now I’m afraid to even go out drinking again. Pls give me your wisdom. Thank you.

1. Chaayos - corporatised this whole unorganised Chai market when everyone was running behind Coffee.

## Maintaining Your Electric Tea Kettle

*   **Wipe the Exterior:** Wipe the exterior of the kettle with a damp cloth to keep it clean.

We’ve definitely had our fair share of ups and downs but as of recent we’ve been going pretty good. Here’s where I need advice. 
He works in the trades and has been working insane hours lately and he’s really only home and awake for about 20 hours out of the whole week. I really do try my best to make his home life easy. I do all of his laundry, prepare all of his snacks for him, make sure we have leftovers for lunch the next day or get something prepared the night before, make sure we have coffee and creamer. Basically make sure he can easily just grab and go in the mornings. I do 98% of all of the cleaning at home and care for the kids, all while working full time myself, so he can have easy going nights for the couple hours he gets at home with us. 
I’m not upset about this, I will do anything for this man. He is working hard for our family and I will support him in any way that I can. 
Here’s the thing.. a couple months ago he started working (tooled up) with a 21F(apprentice). I will admit at 1st I was jealous because she was getting more time with him throughout the week than I get and they seemed to start to get close. But he seemed to  be open about it with me, he enjoyed her company, she is a hard worker and eager to learn. And I thought, well if this is what gets him thru the long work days then so be it. 
He started talking about how they message on FB messenger, ok that’s fine. Then a couple weeks ago he said he gave her his number. I just get a big ick about this. The phone number  seems more personal to me. They are no longer tooled up together but it sounds like they spend all of their breaks together and he randomly buys her items from the food trucks. 
He was talking to me about her the other day, how she’s tooled up with someone else and he’s been making inappropriate comments towards her and my husband had to do something about it. I asked if she’s like his little sister at work? He laughed and said I guess you can say that.. 
He does have a 21yo sister so I didn’t think that was a weird question to ask. 

Here’s where I need some advice. I don’t want to go thru his phone without his knowledge. I want to ask him and have an upfront conversation about it. But with the very little time we have at home together, I worry it’s going to become a big thing. 
Hi it’s me, I’m an over thinker! 
In other situations when I ask a question or what not he will get defensive. I worry he’ll get defensive if I ask and that won’t ease my mind, that will just solidify what I’m already thinking. 

WIBTA if I ask to look at his phone without it becoming a huge deal? I’m not upset or worried that he has a friend at work that is female. It’s the red flags that have come up over the last few weeks that have me worried. We are in the process of buying our 1st home together and I need to ease my mind on this before we are out of the contingency period on this home. ",2,1744126470.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

We’re Vi and June, two friends in their early 30s, looking to make new friends. This post is coming out of a conversation at a train station café, talking about wanting to find people who fit where we are, realizing that after certain life-changing events, the other friends in our lives aren’t the perfect fits they used to be.

Vi: Cheers! I’m 6’0”, pansexual, sarcastic, ambiguously southeast Asian, and writing and communication are fields I’m proud of.

I’m trying to neglect my 60 plants less, spend more time with my cat, and make it through the books on my coffee table. I go on walks with June when we’re free, tennis at night with other friends, building community at a mahjong den in Oakland, have a horrible taste in music (please send me your taste), enjoy writing when I can, making postcards, and being the ambivert that listens and enables productive discussion about being human.

June: Hello future friend! I work in healthcare, with a professional fluency in banter. If I’m not binge watching a series, I’m usually traveling. I’m either eating my way through different countries or visiting my loved ones on the East Coast where I used to live. Simple pleasures in life for me: being on the lookout for the best Vietnamese coffee spots, seeing live music at small venues of my favorite indie artists and finding trails/lakes to run around. I’m an extrovert who enjoys meeting all types of people from different walks of life. I am too much of a homebody like my cat Mittens so I am looking forward to building community and hobbies for myself locally.

I know, the solution to fixing a sour taste is to lower the grind size, increase water output or lower coffee grind volume or raise the water temperature. If I grind finer I always have to set it back to a previous setting for other drinks (and a finer setting doesn't effect it immediately), if I lower the coffee volume it isn't as strong, if I raise the water volume it's no ristretto anymore but a espresso.

This is my first Reddit post- honestly I've been struggling to even write on here, but I've been feeling this overwhelming crippling pain since my (36M) ex dumped me (36F) this February.
I don't know what to do, or how to live with this intense emotional pain. My ex dumped me stating many reasons ie, work, financial stressors, him feeling like i was bringing him into my world, and me not being interested in his world (for context he moved to Canada from Colombia in 2019 and had no friends or family here, but i introduced him to my family and they welcomed him with open arms). He then stated that he felt emotionally drained being in all his relationships where he was required to show up and provide for his gfs and that he just wanted someone to take care of him for once. I was at a complete loss for words, because I had never asked him to pay for anything for me, let alone ask him to be responsible for me. In fact, I would pay for my things, help make his apartment look put together, bought him small things, made him home cooked meals after working long hours, supported him with his immigration process, help him with job hunting, I never complained about his long hours, and even at one point he was a bartender for a year and he loved it, so I bought him an entire bartending kit, books, etc. the list goes on.. I will say, he would buy me dinner and drive me home and pick me up from work, but it was him who always offered and so i would find ways to return the favour with a nice gesture of getting him lunch or coffee. ( i dont have a license, which was one of the main reasons for the tension we had, but i had told him on our first date about my anxieties of driving, and found myself pretty independent on getting from point A to point B on my own).

Around 4 months prior to the breakup, i had sensed a bit of detachment on his side. Less intimacy, less talks about the future.. We had planned 2 years prior that we were going to move out together and i had saved enough to fully furnish our new apartment once we chose one, but he stopped being interested in the idea, he would just ignore me, or say that he couldnt at this time because of his job instability, and his immigration process, etc. I knew he was going through a lot of things, so i tried to support him as much as I could along the way. Overall, I was always pushing for good communication in our relationship, and I had thought we were doing pretty okay on that end.

When we finally broke up, he broke up with me via text , in the middle of my work shift, saying that he wasnt happy, and that he sees me like more of a "" nice girl, a nice companion"" ie roomates. I was utterly gutted. I had made multiple attempts to seek connection, like make reservations at a nice restaurant, bought sexy lingerie instead of wearing my usual comfy flannel pjs.. initiated conversations in a loving understanding way, celebrate small milestones in his life. I responded to his text that I would be picking up my things that day, and asked if he could bring me back home with all my stuff, which he did. When I closed the door to my house, i cried and cried and cried. Cried for what happened, and cried for the fact that I felt so bad that now he was going to be alone in this country without any emotional support.

We went completely No Contact since that day. Not a single text from him. In fact, 10 days after the breakup, he unfriended me and my family and friends off all platforms on social media. Knowing him, I had a small feeling it wasn't only because he wanted a fresh new start without my face reminding him of our relationship.

So 2 weeks go by, 3 weeks, one month, and nothing from him. Meanwhile, i was fighting the urge to text him on an almost hourly basis. So i kept myself busy with work, the gym, friends, and LOTS of podcasts on attachment theories. I cried, and grieved every single day. I cried for the person I lost, i cried for the wounds that were triggered (fear of abandonment, powerlessness, rejection). I was slowly getting to a better place.

Until last week when I saw his whatsapp status.. it was a selfie of him with his new girlfriend, with heart emojis and all. And a link to his apartment for rent- the apartment that he lived in throughout our relationship, the apartment he said he couldn't part with yet because of his financial situation, stress etc.
So now i'm sitting here, writing this, carrying such an immense amount of pain that I cant even put to words. After 2 months, he has a girlfriend, and a new nicer apartment that he shares with her. The apartment signified so much for me, it wasn't just an room with 4 walls and rent- I was asking to build a life together, to be prioritized and to have a shared commitment. I feel like i was the placeholder throughout the entire relationship, questioning myself why didnt i respect my own boundaries? Why didn't I work hard enough? What's wrong with me? Why is he so happy with her and creating a life with her in such a short amount of time, but while I was with him for YEARS supporting everything he wanted to do, he didnt choose to?


How does one cope? I feel like my mind is ruminating 24/7. Not a second goes by that i'm not thinking about it. Even when i'm with my friends, or trying to have some me time, i just cant. I feel like this breakup has triggered so much trauma and grieving and I can't see the other side. Grieving not only the loss of this relationship, but the loss of myself as a person, the loss of my spark, but the loss of a future, the loss of creating a family (im about to be 37 soon, i have been putting a lot of pressure on myself for that).

I've been working with my therapist every week since the breakup, and I look forward to sessions with her, but if anyone has some insight or experiences, it would be greatly appreciated.

Also I noticed that I haven't written much details about him or myself, I think my head is all over the place, I tried to write this 3 times already, so feel free to ask me anything for insight.

2. Buy a larger pantry/hutch that has a counter. It would partially obstruct the vent but I think there’s vent extenders???

My BP has been 150s to 190 over 80 to 105 daily. Granted sometimes I check it at wrong times like after coffee and/or eating but I don't think it explains those levels. 

I need to find out if my bupropion and/or vraylar and/or seroquel are the main cause. I think it would be counterintuitive to raise the dose of my high BP losartan meds instead of lowering the worst culprit of the other meds.

I see doc today and pretty sure I want to try lowering the bupropion back to starting dose of 150 mg and probably raise losartin to max dose of 100 mg. It would suck if the high BP is due to the meds and have to take higher BP meds to counteract bad effects of other meds. Seems counterintuitive. ",3,1744126170.0,bupropion,0,1.0,False

I used a bunch of job subliminals and I got an internship at a really good company and they asked me my availability and I told them April onwards. I was supposed to say May onwards (after exams) but I was really overestimating my abilities and how well I would be able to juggle my college work (6 whole courses) and internship work. I have 6 finals, as well as group project meetings, presentations etc ON TOP of internship 

I am genuinely struggling right now to balance the two and I’m scared that I may not pass my semester which is very important to do bc it’s my last semester here in college. I don’t have money to pay for another semester in college and I wish I could have gone back in time to undo this stupid mistake. I am completely aware that I caused this by my poor decision making skills 

My mental health is all over the place. I haven’t gotten more than 5 hours of sleep. I don’t even have time to sit down and eat, I’m either having coffee or studying… 

I just need a subliminal which solves problems without any bad side effects or harmful consequences. I just want to start from May instead… I don’t know how that’s gonna happen but I just want some sort of solution that’s not going to get me fired because I still really need the internship. ANY PROBLEM SOLVING SUBLIMINALS WILL BE APPRECIATED! (Except spade bc I used her one time and I felt like it was lowk creating problems for me)

1jugbxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jugbxs/ms_the_fifth_beat/,[MS] “The Fifth Beat”,"“The Fifth Beat”

Detective Sergeant Ray Halston lit a cigarette with a hand that trembled slightly from the cold. Not that he’d ever admit it. He stood outside the precinct like he did every morning at 5:57 a.m., three minutes before anyone else showed up. Crisp shirt, polished shoes, trench coat tight around his frame. No one suspected a thing.

They couldn’t.

Inside, his task force waited. Four of the finest misfits to ever grace the badge.

There was Neveah, the tech wizard who could make satellites dance. She dressed like a hacker, talked like a poet, and knew how to find anyone, anywhere.

Next came Dom “Tank” Morales—former cage fighter, the team’s muscle, but loyal as a shepherd. Once broke a guy’s jaw with a clipboard. Still wrote the guy an apology note.

Then there was Juniper “June” Ellis, the profiler. Sharp tongue, sharper instincts. She could peel a suspect open with just a glance and a few words. Everyone was a puzzle to her—but Halston was the one box she never opened.

Lastly, Fletch. Youngest of them, but a prodigy with a badge. He made mistakes, but never the same one twice. Worshipped Halston like a father.

Together, they were something rare—efficient, unorthodox, and tight as a drum.
And Halston? He was their center. Their anchor. The man who never missed a shift, never dropped the ball, never showed a crack.
Because if he did, they’d see it. They’d see everything.

At night, Halston didn’t go home. He walked the city until the lights blurred, then ducked into the old service tunnel behind the municipal courthouse. He kept his blankets dry in a locked storage unit under a fake name. Read case files by flashlight. Slept with one eye open.

Two years, not a soul had noticed.
Not when he sold his apartment to pay off his late wife’s hospital debts. Not when he started washing his shirts at a 24-hour laundromat on 9th. Not when he ate cold chili from a can three nights a week and claimed he was “cutting back.”
He couldn’t let them know. If they pitied him, he’d lose everything—their trust, their rhythm, the job.
But secrets rot. Even in the strongest of men.

One night, during a high-stakes bust in the Docklands, Halston took a swing to the ribs that nearly dropped him. Fletch caught him.
“You okay, Sarge?”
Halston nodded. “Just winded. Keep moving.”
But afterward, as they debriefed in the van, June stared at him too long.
“You’ve lost weight, boss. More than usual.”
Halston shrugged. “Stress diet.”
Tank handed him a protein bar. “Eat something. You’re not a ghost yet.”Neveah just looked at him, silent, eyes flickering like code.

Later that week, he returned to his tunnel to find the lock broken. Inside, everything was gone—blankets, papers, even the old photo of his wife.
But in its place was a duffel bag. Clean clothes. Food. A motel keycard.
And a note, handwritten.
You don’t have to carry the weight alone anymore. We’re your team, Sarge. All five of us.
No signature. None needed.
Halston sat down hard, the note in one hand, pride in the other, cracking like glass.
He took one deep breath. Then he stood up. There was still a job to do.

“The Fifth Beat: Part II – Shadows in the Frame”
Ray Halston checked into the motel that night, using the keycard from the duffel bag. Room 206. Clean. Quiet. Paid for a week.
No one said a word the next morning. June handed him coffee like she always did. Neveah cracked jokes from behind her triple-screen laptop. Tank was running drills with Fletch in the basement gym. But they all moved like a unit around him—watchful, protective. Not in pity. In respect.
They hadn’t broken the silence to shame him.
They were waiting for him to speak when he was ready.
But Halston didn’t talk. Not yet. Instead, he watched them closer than ever, starting to see them not just as tools of the job—but as people. Wounded, sharp, loyal people. Like him.

Neveah Gray had grown up in foster care. In every home, she’d learned how to disappear—until she learned how to find others instead. Hacking wasn’t a skill she picked up; it was a survival instinct. She joined the force after her foster brother vanished, and the cops wrote it off as “just another runaway.” Halston was the only one who read her file and said, “If you’re this good off the books, I want to see what you can do by the badge.” She’s been his shadow ever since.

Dom “Tank” Morales once fought for money in underground rings in Detroit. Served time for aggravated assault after a bar brawl turned ugly. Inside, he found faith. Came out quieter, stronger. Didn’t say much until a gang tried to shake down his baby sister, and he put three of them in the hospital. That time, the cops wanted to press charges again—but Halston stepped in. Saw the intent. Brought him in as a consultant for gang cases. Dom never left.

Juniper Ellis was a profiler from Quantico, too smart for her own good and too sharp to stay liked. She burned bridges, said the wrong things in the right way. She almost quit the bureau until Halston offered her freedom, autonomy, and respect. With him, she didn’t need to soften herself—just solve cases. Still, she kept a file on Halston. Not official. Just notes. Out of instinct. Because something about him had always felt… unfinished.

Fletch—real name Danny Fletcher—was a rookie when Halston met him. Brilliant, mouthy, and reckless. Had a permanent chip on his shoulder from growing up watching his father get railroaded by a crooked cop. Fletch joined the force not to enforce the law, but to change it from the inside. Halston gave him purpose and discipline. In return, Fletch gave Halston someone to believe in again. The kid reminded him of his son—before the cancer.

The team’s latest case was getting darker. A series of high-level informants were turning up dead—one of them a protected asset Halston himself had flipped back in ‘08. There were patterns in the bodies. Staged scenes. All pointing to someone inside law enforcement.
And while the squad worked the angles, Halston kept getting anonymous letters. No threats. Just words like: 
“You can’t outrun ghosts forever.”

It made his skin crawl.

Then one night, June followed him after shift. Watched him sit in the motel parking lot for over an hour, staring at nothing.

When he finally noticed her, she didn’t flinch.
“You know,” she said, “you don’t have to live in the wreckage. You can build something new.”
Halston looked at her. “Don’t know how.”
“Good thing you’ve got four people willing to teach you.”
He nodded once. Small. Grateful.
Then his burner phone buzzed. A photo.
It was the team—surveillance shot. Taken from across the street. A red X had been drawn over 

Dom’s face.

Below it, one line:

“The Fifth Beat falls next.”

Halston’s heart froze.

He looked at June. “Wake everybody. Now.”

First time all of my symptoms improved by 80 percent within 3-4 days when I added choline/inositol and cut out coffee. That lasted 1 week then went down to I suppose 65% improvement because starbursts and glares returned. 

Then I started methyl b12 and folate and vitamin d and cut out all caffeine and saw my starbursts and glares go away, also short lived but got to about 80% improvement then decreased to like 70% since starbursts and glares returned but only at certain angles. 2 weeks ago, for seemingly no reason but sleeping and eating better and walking 3-4 miles a day, my daylight glares went away completely - it was magical. But then it got rainy so I couldn’t walk much and I was staying up late and a few days ago my glares have slightly returned and starbursts are little bit more prominent regardless of angle. I’d say I’m back to 70% improvement overall. 

Why could this be happening? I imagine progress isn’t linear but I’m trying to ignore and let things fade to the background but the repeated back and forth of changes makes it hard.

Yes, I know the irony in the Nespresso mug.
…
I received this for Christmas back in 2021. I originally asked for it so my brother (a barista at Starbucks) and me (just a coffee lover) could mess around with it for a hobby. 

We messed with it a few times and failed, so I didn’t really touch it because I was waiting to buy a grinder… I was a broke teacher on a budget at the time. 

Unfortunately, 2 months later my brother passed away & I couldn’t bring myself to pull it out. 

Last year I finally bought a grinder (eureka mignon crono) and dusted this machine off to try to get it to work. In the meantime, my mom opened a coffee shop in our local town and I started working there on the weekends. I do all of her recipe development as well. Unfortunately, it stopped working while I was trying to dial it in…BUT my mom had just bought her machine for the shop so I’d just been practicing on there. 

I wanted to get mine fixed still so I could practice my latte art without wasting my mom’s product/profit

Fast forward to last weekend: my dad took my gaggia completely apart and rewired it & somehow fixed whatever issue it was having. 

After spending a good chunk of time last night dialing it in, I can say I successfully made both me and my husband lattes before we left for work today. 

There are still some kinks, but I’m pretty proud!

Also want to add that I used the double espresso spout portafilter. Took me 3 hours last night to realize that the bottomless portafilter I had bought years ago was for a triple shot… I’m super glad that I didn’t get frustrated and quit, haha. 

I’m trying to figure out if I should buy a bottomless portafilter for a double shot or keep using my spout portafilter. What do you guys think?
Also—any advice is welcomed!!

1jug7kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jug7kp/subtle_feeling_of_anxiety_and_avoidance_how_do_i/,"Subtle feeling of anxiety and avoidance, how do I rewire my brain?","Hi everyone!

As a teenager, I was always very reserved and over the years I developed a certain fear of social relationships and meeting new people. I spent half a year in a psychiatric clinic and then another year in an ambulante therapeutic setting due to moderate depression. The main focus there was on processing childhood trauma. But I also always sought help because I was concerned about how I interacted socially.

In the clinic, one of the caregivers did an exercise with me: I was supposed to ask strangers for directions, ask for jeans in a fashion store, and place an order in a café. Everything went smoothly — somewhat puzzled, she basically said: “You don’t have social anxiety.” That was ten years ago.

After being discharged and spending several years without therapeutic support, I built up a lot of self-confidence and now live a “normal” life. I’m able to deal well with my memories and trauma, and I would describe myself as happy. “Moderate depression” really no longer applies.

**However, this subtle social anxiety is still there.** Especially now, because I’m about to start a new chapter in my life: I’m beginning university and completely changing my career path — a fresh start, both professionally and personally.

It’s a mix of boredom, because I was always underchallenged in my previous sales job, and excitement because I don’t know what’s coming. Old familiar fears are creeping back:  
*Will people like me? How do I come across to others? Will I be “the weird one” again like I was in school? Did I choose the right major? What do I even want to do with my life?*

The list of questions goes on and on — it's a real spiral of overthinking.

Ever since I’ve become aware that something completely new is starting soon, I’ve started avoiding social interactions again, get caught up in rumination, and have developed avoidance behaviors. It’s not panic attacks, but rather this strange feeling of anxiety and this voice saying: “Don’t do it. Absolutely don’t take this next step.”

Today, I had an aha moment: Every time I’ve had caffeine for a few days — be it coffee or Red Bull — this strange feeling gets noticeably stronger. I came across “caffeine-induced anxiety,” and somehow it totally makes sense. So, I’ve decided to completely cut out caffeine to avoid intensifying these anxiety feelings.

I also want to start supplementing with vitamins and minerals again, because that has worked for me in the past. My fiancée suggested I might try antidepressants that can help relieve anxiety. I’m also thinking about therapy again, though I’ve been through so much therapy in my life that it’s honestly the least appealing option to me right now. I feel like I need some kind of rewiring of my brain.

This post kind of went all over the place, but maybe some of you have suggestions for how I can get out of this weird state. I’m grateful for any thoughts on this post — I’m genuinely curious.

Do you have similar symptoms? In this subreddit, people often talk about panic attacks, but I don’t have those — or is it possible to have panic attacks without being fully aware of it? What natural remedies help with this maybe low level anxiety? Any advice?",2,1744125762.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

[UP TO €2K]","I have been reading a lot within the community, which has been a huge learning experience, however my requirements are slightly different from most posters, leaving me with some doubts.

I am EU based (if useful for pricing of different brands, etc), and have 3-4 coffees per day, all espressos. I quite literally never use milk, I would say 95% pure espresso and 5% cappuccino. For this reason, while the presence of a steam wand is appreciated for the occasional weekend cappuccino, its quality, automation, ability to operate at the same time as the coffee via dual boiler, etc. are not relevant factors for me.

Currently I have my coffees at home, where I have an old espresso machine, and at work, where I have a pod-based machine by Illy (the Illy iperespresso). 

In terms of taste, on the Nespresso system I always have the Napoli flavour, and occasionally the Ristretto Decaf. On the Illy system, I like their Intenso pods (brown label). I also never add sugar. I would define my taste as the usual mid-to-dark roast blend from southern italy / neapolitan style.

Now, the main reason I used those systems until today is convenience. While I enjoy seeing the videos of the full coffee workflow on social networks, I work long hours, and I do have other hobbies in my free time. Therefore, I would like to step up from the pod machines (which I would define as producing a zero effort, reliable, passable quality coffee) and have as good as possible of an espresso (being a somewhat frequent drinker), but minimizing the learning curve, the constant fine tuning of grinding, the warm-up waiting time, creative solutions such as temp surfing, mods such as the Gaggiuno, etc. While I fully understand these can be interesting and extremely rewarding, I'd like to go for a low effort, low volatility outcome that can yield better results than the pod machines.

Budget is flexible, while taking into account the obvious diminishing returns that apply to most hobbies. I am fine with spending as long as it gets a solution that is significantly better at combining convenience and quality.

I am okay with selecting 1 type of coffee beans, dedicate some time to dial in, and ""commit"" to that one over time to avoid constant changes over time, to keep workflow simple and minimized, while experimenting with new types over weekends/holidays etc.

TL;DR

I now use pod-based machines, 3-4 coffees per day, always drink espressos, never using milk nor sugar, mid-to-dark roast, want to improve quality but convenience (warm up time, simple workflow and dial-in, etc) is key. Budget can be flexible if achieving quality + convenience for no-milk espressos, based in EU.

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS AFTER READING THE FORUM

1) MACHINE + GRINDER: SAGE BAMBINO (NON PLUS) + NICHE ZERO

Seems easy out of the box, warm up in a few seconds, pre-infusion, PID, simple workflow between the two, fully focused on mid-dark espressos (incl conical burr grinder), seems to be capable to produce very high quality espressos, no temperature regulation seems okay with my requirements (100% mid/dark espressos).

2) ALL IN ONE: BREVILLE BARISTA PRO

All-in-one machines, still warming up pretty fast, even simpler workflow incl. cleaning etc (being all internal to the machine), Possibly lower quality final outcome due to worse grinder, and possibly paying for other functions not really used (milk frothing, etc)

What would you suggest? Any other option I'm currently forgetting? Any solution where I can save money, or where I can pay up to signifcantly improve some aspects of my requirements (simplicity, realiability, quality of espressos)?",1,1744125723.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1jug5hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/1jug5hv/needing_advice_for_growing_trees/,Needing advice for growing trees,"So my uncle loves cosmic apples and is buying a house soon, so for his 10th year of sobriety (in about five years) I'm wanting to gift him a cosmic apples tree. I'm wanting to take the hard part out - making sure it lives long enough to be planted in the ground, he's got a green thumb but also two young kids 4m and 8f. I've read that you can keep them in a lot for 5 to 6 years which is perfect timing. My main concern is the following:

Cosmic apples needs 8 hours of full sun light, the trees would be sitting in my front room (due to it having the most natural light) which doesn't get sun light until 1pm and the sun starts setting around 7pm. Would it be best to get a solar lamp to make sure it gets the full 8 hours of sun? If so which one is best and do I turn it on when the sun is fully set or would it best to turn it on at 7pm?

Young cosmos apple trees are supposed to be water once a week. How much water should they get at that time? Is it okay to use rice water Ive heard it's good for plants? How many years old does a tree have to be before it's considered a adult, does it vary by tree species? 

What's the best soil to use for them? Mulch or no? Is miracle grow okay to use? Also I since I drink coffee is it okay to put the coffee ground in the soil (I've heard it good for plants but haven't heard anything about trees)?

Would it be okay to go ahead with the biggest pot or should I slowly repot it? Which brand of pots is best for trees.

Is it okay to keep the trees inside, we have rabbits in my area that have mange, stray cats, moles, goffers, and foxes I don't want that in my soil. Will the trees be okay without having bees around to pollinate it?


Also I have cats in my house and was wondering if attaching chicken wire to the in compass the tree would be a good idea? My cats have never been around potted plants before so I'm worried how they'll react (i.e eat the plant or tear it up)

“For me the action is the juice."" - Michael
Cheritto

Heat (1995) was released to audiences 30 years ago this upcoming December. For movie fans the action has always been the juice, but over the course of his two hour and fifty-minute epic it seems that Mann wants it to be about much more than that. I saw Heat in the theater when it was released in 1995, and l've owned it on every physical media format since then, all of which is to say l've watched the film many times. What I love most about it is that Michael Mann wasn't dumbing down his script for anybody. I bet the first dozen times that I watched Heat I never really understood the plot. He's throwing so many secondary character names at us like Van Zant, Waingro, Kelso, Nate, and WTF are bearer bonds anyway and why are they worth so much? There's just SO much stuffed into this flick. But like a good roller coaster ride I didn't need to make sense out of how it all worked, I just wanted to enjoy the ride. For me, the action was the juice! Then a funny thing happened, and this is one of those things I love about really good movies, is that each time I watched it (which was probably once every couple of years) I would pick up on little things that I hadn't noticed before. Thanks to some interesting points made by MLZ, this time around when I watched Heat I really wanted to focus on Vincent and Neil's relationships.

At its core this movie is a game of cat and mouse between a team of detectives and a crew of professional thieves. Vincent Hanna
leads the detectives and struggles to balance his professional career with his personal relationships. Neil McCauley leads a team of thieves that are also struggling to balance their criminal aspirations with their personal relationships. In both cases their relationships pay the price. The relationship dynamics weave in and out of the cat and mouse game, and while they're critical to understanding the motivations of the characters I can't help but think they're the weakest part of the movie after viewing it this time around. I think Vincent and Neil's relationships are so problematic because I just don't care about Hanna's third marriage or his stepdaughter, and Neil's relationship makes no sense to me at all. I realized for the first time during this viewing that Hanna succinctly summarizes his unraveling marriage in a sentence or two during his conversation with Neil over coffee.

In that moment he encapsulates everything I really needed to know about his marriage, and let's face it, how does his marriage affect his pursuit of Neil and his crew anyway? We don't need to understand that dynamic to understand Vincent is a career detective married to his job and loves nothing more than pursuing a crew of professional thieves.

If I made a director's cut of Heat, I'm shaving off all the scenes of Justine and Lauren which probably saves ten or fifteen minutes and leaves us with a smoother flowing story.

Then there's the troubling relationship between Eady and Neil which makes no sense at all. Neil is a career criminal who is on the verge of a couple of huge scores but has inexplicably decided to stop practicing what he preaches when it comes to not having personal attachments. Mann lets us know that she and Neil are both alone, but not lonely, so we can understand that maybe there's an attraction and they both want a little lovin', but are we really supposed to believe that the two of them form such a strong bond so quickly as to motivate them to make such irrational decisions? Would Eady really continue to stay with Neil when given multiple opportunities to leave after she realizes he's a lying, killing bank robber? Based on what limited information we know about her it just doesn't add up. I think if we were being honest with Neil's character, then there's no way he's going back to Eady's house after the botched bank robbery.
In my director's cut we're scratching Neil going back to Eady's house, and he goes from killing Van Zant to the scene where he's grabbing his new cover paperwork from Nate without Eady. It makes much more sense to me that he meets Nate alone. Then Neil goes for Waingro at the hotel. Also, in that scene Nate tells us Chris left and is going it alone.
We don't need to see Chris or Charlene again after that, so l'm shaving off another ten minutes of the movie by cutting that stuff out.

I could easily do a deep dive into everything I love about Heat, but MLZ's review made me want to re-evaluate Vincent and Neil's relationships this time around, and what I discovered is that I think the movie works better for me without spending so much time on those relationships. Thankfully, I love everything else about the film. At #106 on the IMDB Top 250 Movies list, it surprisingly garnered zero Oscar nominations that year, but great movies endure over time, and thirty years later Michael Mann's film Heat is still considered a classic and required viewing for cinephiles.

Bonus recommendation: Check out Michael Mann's 1981 film Thief starring James Caan.
It's a great companion film to Heat and you'll see a lot of the same ingredients. ",3,1744125561.0,500moviesorbust,1,1.0,False

>Dear friends and neighbors,

>2025 has been full of exciting changes and promises kept, and I wanted to take time to share with you how I’ve been serving and spending time with Ohioans since becoming your U.S. Senator this January.

>On the policy front, I’ve voted to increase border security measures and reverse bureaucratic red tape that’s been weighing down both job creators and everyday Ohioans. Because Ohio hasn’t been afraid to cut silly and outdated rules in our state code, I [wrote a bill](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/ai-can-be-a-force-for-deregulation-technology-government-ohio-federal-365ed0d4) to bring that common-sense approach to Washington.

>On the home front, I’ve made it a priority to spend time meeting with Ohioans in person—whether I’m representing them in Washington or visiting with them in our state. In my first weeks as your voice in Washington, I’ve been part of more than 100 meetings with Ohioans and Ohio job creators. We also launched the [Husted Huddle](https://nitter.poast.org/SenJonHusted/status/1899590442062143705) as an opportunity for Ohioans to share their priorities with me over coffee.

>As my team and I are working each day to open more offices across our state, I’ve been traveling to hear from men and women on the ground in Ohio. Most recently, I saw up close the work that Ohioans are doing to make the products that keep our economy running and to care for our veterans and neighbors living with disabilities.

>**On the ground in Ohio**  
Last week, I was on the ground with job creators, workers, and non-profit employees in Cincinnati. At Fayette County’s [Honda/LG Energy](https://nitter.poast.org/SenJonHusted/status/1905684804915613827)’s Mega Site, I visited the spot where hundreds of Ohioans will soon be building the cars of the future.

>I also spent time with workers at [Hollaender Manufacturing](https://nitter.poast.org/SenJonHusted/status/1905690470757609677), which makes products that have been used at the bottom of the ocean, the surface of the moon, and everywhere in between.

>Later that day, I got to know the people at [Easterseals Redwood](https://nitter.poast.org/SenJonHusted/status/1905708860352119282), an independent non-profit focused on the power and purpose of work. They introduced me to how they offer meaningful job training to help underemployed Ohioans—including veterans, military families, and people living with disabilities—become part of our workforce.

>**Bringing Ohio’s innovation to Washington**  
There is much to be done in Washington, and your input helps me better represent our state. Ohioans are sharing how they want to see a government that works more efficiently while taking less of their hard-earned money.

>I just wrote a bill to streamline the federal code of regulations by using an AI tool to identify redundant, outdated, and silly rules. Unnecessary rules make it hard for everyday Ohioans and job creators to understand and abide by the law, which burns time and money.

>This Senate bill is based on the success we had when I was lieutenant governor using an AI tool to shave 5 million unnecessary words from Ohio’s code. That effort alone is estimated to have saved $44 million of your taxpayer dollars and 58,000 employee hours, and I’m committed to helping Washington stop the waste at the federal level. You can read more about it in my [Wall Street Journal op-ed](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/ai-can-be-a-force-for-deregulation-technology-government-ohio-federal-365ed0d4).

>I also helped the Senate [pass a resolution](https://nitter.poast.org/SenJonHusted/status/1908411013654798820) that would provide more resources for securing the southern border and making American energy more dominant and affordable again.

>**Let’s stay in touch**  
As I work to bring Ohio values and priorities to the Capitol, your thoughts are always on my mind. I’d like to share several ways that we can hear from each other regularly.

>One of the best ways to keep up with the work I’m doing for Ohioans is to follow me on X at \\@SenJonHusted, Facebook at [www.facebook.com/SenJonHusted](http://www.facebook.com/SenJonHusted), and Instagram at  \\@SenJonHusted.

1jug2li,https://www.reddit.com/r/playadelcarmen/comments/1jug2li/a_couple_of_recommendations_in_playa/,A couple of recommendations in Playa,"Hi all,

  
We just returned to Minnesota from Playa a couple weeks ago and want to give a couple shoutouts/recommendations from our experience for anyone looking.

1. We rented an Airbnb and Aldea Thai and would definitely rent there again. We are a family of 5 with 3 teenagers and are pretty low key in general. The accommodations there were super nice and relaxing. The shared pool is chill, not a party atmosphere and honestly a lot of the time was pretty empty. Very quite at night, except for the NorthWest corner which is where our condo was, where the music from the bars outside is very loud. We were all so exhausted at the end of the day it really didn't matter though. If you are looking for a chill spot to stay, I would definitely recommend. Bonus, many of the apartments have small private pools as well, which is a great way to have a coffee in the morning!

2. There is a beach bar/stand down below called ""Freshy Fish"". We did not eat there, so I can't comment on the food. The drinks were exactly what we wanted though. Liters of Margaritas, Daiquiris, Pina Coladas and probably any other beach drink you want for under $10. We would get a liter, put half in the freezer and drink half of it. Jesus, who is the bartender down there was also great. He is super nice guy and he helped me practice my Spanish and I helped him practice his English while waiting for drinks. He was also very knowledgable about the area and gave us some fantastic recommendations, especially in regards to places not 5th Ave.

3. We did end up booking some activities through the excursion people that sell all over playa. I can't speak for all of them, I can speak for one stand in particular. The stand is at the North East corner of Calle 28 Norte and C. Cozumel, which was right across from our condo. We booked three separate trips from Ricardo over there.  The main reason that I want to mention this is the way it all turned out and I told Ricardo I was going to post this on Reddit (which he had never heard of, lol). Two of our trips (Xcarate and Xel-ha) went off without a hitch and we had a lot of fun. Our second to last day in town we had a trip booked to go to Cozumel and go snorkeling. We got out to Cozumel and the waves were too high and they shut down all snorkeling boats, huge bummer for me. Ricardo called me on WhatsApp immediately and told me to just rent a car and tour the island and not worry about anything, we would figure it out when we got back. He called me while on the ferry back to Playa around 8 PM, told me the stand was closed and he was at home, but to send him a message and he would run down and talk to me about what to do. He did as he said and met me after he was already done for the day. We decided we weren't going to have time to rebook and that we were just wanting a refund. He knew we were leaving in a day and they probably could have strung us along and not refunded our money, but they didn't. He and his boss, both had to withdraw the funds from their bank accounts and pay it back to us...they definitely didn't have to do it and they did...stand up humans and would love to push them some business for their integrity! Also received a text on our way out of town from Ricardo that was super nice letting us know we have a friend in Playa if we ever come back. So hit him up and tell him his buddy from Minnesota, Anthony sent you!

4. Finally, Jesus at ""Freshy Fish"" gave me a killer recommendation on a tattoo shop in town. My daughter really wanted a tattoo, but I am super leery about shops and people trying to recruit business for their shop from strangers walking down the street. He showed me a couple of his tattoos that came from ""Estudio Antara Tatuajes"". This shop is off the tourist strip and up on Calle 38th nte and between 10 Avanida nte and 20 Avanida nte (https://maps.app.goo.gl/V4ADdLWdNuCkiWCC7). The work they are turning out really is amazing. Matais did our matching tattoos and it is honestly the best tattoo I have on a body pretty full of tattoos. My daughter wanted a jelly fish, pretty classic vacation tattoo, but he sat down and drew us up a tattoo in like 30 minutes. No flash, custom art piece! Hers she wanted black with pink highlights and the color is so solid and saturated and the blacks are super punched in. Line work on both is very delicate, yet bold, and just buttery smooth. Mine is just black, no colors and again so saturated, amazing line work and shading is beautiful. Getting a tattoo on vacation can be iffy, but hands down I would recommend this shop to anyone and likely would get most of my tattoos there if they were in my city.

  
Overall a great place to visit with some incredible people to meet along the way! Hopefully this recommendation pushes these deserving folks some business!",1,1744125415.0,playadelcarmen,0,1.0,False
1jug2ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingHub/comments/1jug2ik/creating_a_unique_reading_writing_experience/,Creating a unique reading / writing experience (group invite),"For all the ways we've advanced in consuming the written word, the experience of reading creative fiction remains largely unchanged. A protagonist is introduced, and people, events, and obstacles are placed in their path as they pursue a goal.

Almost everything we read in fiction is some manner of plot device. Whether it’s Chekhov’s gun, the hero’s call to adventure, or the inevitable third-act twist, the machinery of storytelling tends to churn out the same familiar parts—just with new names, fresh catastrophes, and rebranded challenges.

Sure, that formula gets tweaked occasionally, fractured timelines, unreliable narrators, and a plethora of other adjustments. But it’s still a protagonist doing stuff. Everyone else. Everyone else! No matter how many pages of backstory they get (or even how many books), they exist to serve that story. They’re not people, just functions. A collection of foils, mentors, distractions, and catalysts.

But what if there were no side characters? What if every character had their own story—each one a protagonist in their own right, with their own lives, biases, blind spots, and truths?

As a reader, imagine this: every character you encounter is a new thread, waiting to pull you into their orbit. The guy behind the coffee cart, would you want to know his life? His secrets? The couple arguing in the restaurant. Would you read about why they're falling apart? And the murder victim. Would you want to explore her entire life before it ended?

There are exceptionally few, genuinely unique reading experiences in the world. I'm trying to create one. A world with breadth, depth, and scale like nothing that's come before.

But to build it, I need readers. I need writers. I need the people who think this is an amazing idea and the ones who think it’s dumb.

Because if I can find that group of people, I believe this has the potential to be something truly magnificent.

This story is just beginning, and there’s a journey to take before it truly gets underway. The hope is that within a month we'll having stories published. The goal is a group of readers, writers, and everything in between—who come together to create something none of us could create alone. A project that aims to elevate everyone who takes part in it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cooking a tomahawk steak using the sous vide method brings out the best flavors while ensuring each bite is tender and juicy. This cut of meat is often a centerpiece that can impress your guests during any special occasion. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you master the art of sous vide tomahawk steak, making sure it turns out perfect every time.

### What You Need

- 1 tomahawk steak (about 2-3 inches thick)
- Salt and pepper (to taste)
- Herbs (like rosemary or thyme)
- Butter (for finishing)
- Vacuum sealer and bags or zip-top bags
- Sous vide immersion circulator
- Cast-iron skillet or grill (for searing)

### Preparing the Tomahawk Steak

Start by removing your tomahawk steak from the refrigerator. Allow it to come to room temperature for about 30-45 minutes. This step is vital as it helps the meat cook evenly.

Season your steak generously with salt and pepper on all sides. Don’t be shy with the seasoning; meat can handle it, and it will significantly enhance the flavor. You can also add herbs like rosemary or thyme for an extra layer of aroma.

### Vacuum Sealing the Steak

Next, you will need to seal your steak for sous vide cooking. If using a vacuum sealer, place the seasoning and steak inside a vacuum bag. Remove as much air as possible and seal it tightly. If using a zip-top bag, place the steak inside, then slowly submerge the bag in water, forcing out the air before sealing the bag completely. This technique is known as the water displacement method.

### Set Up the Sous Vide

Fill a large pot or container with water and attach your sous vide immersion circulator. Set the temperature according to your preference:

- Rare: 125°F (52°C)
- Medium Rare: 130°F (54°C)
- Medium: 140°F (60°C)
- Medium Well: 150°F (65°C)
- Well Done: 160°F (71°C)

Once the water reaches the desired temperature, submerge the sealed steak completely in the water bath. Cook the steak for a minimum of 2 hours and a maximum of 4 hours. The longer cooking time tenderizes the meat without overcooking it.

 *Shop Sous Vide Here - https://hownow101.github.io/SousVide *​  
  
### Finishing the Steak** After the sous vide cooking time is complete, carefully remove the steak from the bag. Pat it dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This step is essential for achieving a perfect crust when searing.

Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill over high heat and add a bit of oil and butter. Once hot, sear the steak for 1-2 minutes on each side until it develops a beautiful brown crust. Be mindful of not overcooking it during this process. You want to add texture and flavor without affecting the perfect doneness you’ve achieved through sous vide cooking.

### Serving the Tomahawk Steak

Once seared, let the steak rest for a few minutes before slicing. Resting is crucial, as it allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. Slice the steak against the grain to ensure tenderness. You can serve it directly on the bone for a showstopping presentation or sliced on a cutting board with sides like grilled vegetables, mashed potatoes, or a fresh salad.

Pair it with a robust red wine or a classic side such as chimichurri sauce to enhance the flavors further. Your guests will undoubtedly be impressed by the tenderness and flavor of the sous vide tomahawk steak.

### Final Thoughts

Cooking a tomahawk steak using the sous vide method not only guarantees perfectly cooked meat but also allows you to enjoy your time with guests without the stress of constant monitoring. Embrace this technique and elevate your cooking game to impress everyone at your next gathering with this delicious showstopper.

Unique Seasoning and Side Dish Ideas to Complement Your Tomahawk Steak
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When preparing a stunning tomahawk steak, your seasoning and side dishes can elevate the meal from impressive to unforgettable. A well-cooked steak deserves flavors that enhance its natural taste, while accompanying dishes can provide balance and excitement to the dining experience. Here are unique seasoning and side dish ideas to complement your delicious tomahawk steak.

 *Shop Sous Vide Here - https://hownow101.github.io/SousVide *​  
  
### Unique Seasoning Ideas** Seasoning a tomahawk steak properly is crucial for maximizing flavor. Here are some unique blends and combinations that will wow your guests:

- **Herb-Infused Garlic Butter:** Mix softened butter with minced garlic, chopped fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme, and parsley. This rich topping adds a savory depth that melts perfectly over your steak.
- **Smoky Paprika Rub:** Combine smoked paprika, black pepper, sea salt, and a touch of cayenne for a delightful kick. The smokiness adds layers of flavor that complement the grilled aroma of your steak.
- **Coffee and Brown Sugar Crust:** Blend ground coffee, brown sugar, kosher salt, and a hint of chili powder. This unique rub creates a caramelized crust that balances sweetness with a slight bitterness.
- **Truffle Salt Finish:** After cooking, sprinkle a light touch of truffle salt over your tomahawk steak. The luxurious earthiness enhances the steak's richness without overpowering its natural taste.

### Creative Side Dishes

A meal is much more enjoyable when the sides play their part. Here are some creative side dishes that pair beautifully with your tomahawk steak:

- **Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Chives:** Creamy mashed potatoes with roasted garlic and fresh chives offer a comforting, rich side that complements the robust flavor of the steak.
- **Charred Brussels Sprouts with Bacon:** Roasting Brussels sprouts until crispy and mixing in some crispy bacon lardons adds crunch and smokiness, balancing the steak’s tenderness.
- **Roasted Root Vegetables:** Carrots, parsnips, and sweet potatoes roasted with olive oil and thyme provide a colorful, sweet contrast to the savory steak.
- **Grilled Asparagus:** Simple yet elegant, grilled asparagus drizzled with lemon juice adds a fresh, slightly bitter note that enhances the meal beautifully.

### Refreshing Salads

Adding a salad to your plate can introduce exciting textures and flavors. Here are some salad ideas that can serve as light, refreshing complements:

- **Arugula and Pear Salad:** Toss fresh arugula with thinly sliced pears, crumbled blue cheese, and candied walnuts. A drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette brings all the flavors together.
- **Caprese Salad:** Layer fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. Finish with a drizzle of high-quality olive oil and balsamic reduction for a classic italian touch.
- **Greek Salad:** Combine cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion, and feta cheese with a zesty dressing made of olive oil, lemon juice, and oregano for a Mediterranean flair.

### Decadent Dips

Don’t forget about dips and sauces to enhance the experience further:

- **Spicy Chimichurri:** Blend chopped parsley, oregano, garlic, red pepper flakes, and olive oil for a vibrant sauce that adds brightness and heat.
- **Blue Cheese Sauce:** Melt some blue cheese with sour cream, garlic powder, and a little lemon juice. This rich dip pairs excellently with the steak's umami flavors.

In these classes I can tak about pretty much everything although I make many mistakes. What I find discouraging is speaking in daily life with Dutch people.

I talk about work, movies and everything with my tutors but even when I’m ordering coffee in daily life people immediately switch to English like there is a mandate. I assume people do this in good faith thinking maybe I would be more comfortable but I find it very disheartening.

Does anyone else having similar experiences as me, and if so how do you overcome it? I spent a lot of time and money learning Dutch and I may stay here for longer but I feel like this is where I’m hitting a glass wall in integrating to the society.",17,1744125180.0,learndutch,12,1.0,False

I can’t imagine where I got the goddamn thing. The only reason I ever touched a flame to its four wicks in the first place was because of the blackout.

  The saying goes that there are only two seasons in the desert: hot and cold. Either a smidge of precipitation or a fine layer of clouds overhead will do your internet connection or phone reception no favors. Inclement weather can send a small enough town to hell.

So, I'd anticipated the blackout even before I’d finished the second shift at the plant. Heavy northern winds had started gusting down from the highlands around half-past-five that evening, rattling the high-placed windows in the meat-processing room. The winds grew in strength for the next two hours, until the overhead lights started flickering around a quarter-past-eight. The drive home was starless, and brown plumes of dirt and grit clouded the winding road in my headlights.

  At home, I battened down the garage door against the blasting gales, gathered the Mag-Lite and a box of matches from a drawer in the work bench, and hauled a box of candles off the floor. I carried all of my preparations to the kitchen table.

  Under the box’s dusty, cardboard lid, I found a dozen candles, each of varying size. The biggest was a block of wax, maybe seven-by-seven inches thick and ten inches tall. Four wicks poked out at the top, each eccentrically placed inside one the mass's four quarters. Each was slightly charred and centered in a shallow bowl of melted wax, attesting to some previous use. Otherwise, the top of the candle was flat, and no dried rivulets ran down the sides.

  I carried the block to the living room with the aim of placing it on the coffee table, figuring it would give the greatest amount of light and burn the longest. At the very least, even if it burned faster than I estimated it ought to, I could douse three of the wicks and just burn one at a time as a conservation measure. It was quite heavy, as I expected a big hunk of wax would be, but it had a strange heft to it. I got the impression that its center of gravity was somewhat wonky, like there was maybe an air pocket inside one corner, just under the surface. Setting it on a paper plate to catch the rivulets of melting wax, I gave each side a couple of firm taps but detected no weaknesses in any of the four walls.

  For the first time, the color of the candle struck me. It was darkly hued, less an uneven shade of violet than a constant but subtle shifting between tints of muted indigo and damp, brick red, depending on which angle the living room's three electric lamps caught it. Occasionally, I'd spy blotches of blackish, mossy green that seemed to bleed in and out when I tilted my head one way or the other.

  The wind was getting worse, rattling the windowpanes and pummeling the rooftop. The house lights started to flicker in tandem with each volley, so I had little interest in plumbing the depths of the big candle's superficial mysteries as I began to place other candles around the house. I only paused to assure myself that the batteries in the bedside alarm clock were fresh.

  I had just returned to the living room to switch off the power strip to the computer and the TV, when the cat started yowling on the front porch. I opened the door, and in an instant, she scampered in from the howling weather, dispensing with any feline aplomb. It was just then that the lights went out.

  Of course, I hadn’t thought to bring the flashlight with me, so I had to bump my way back to the couch blindly, stepping high to avoid the cat as she tried to rub her sides against my ankles. I patted around the cushions for a ridiculously long time before my fingertips bumped into the cold, metal sides tucked halfway under a throw pillow.

  After I was able to see again, I lit the big candle first, touching a single match flame to each of the four wicks crowning the top. I noticed nothing—*untoward*, is the world that pops into my head—nothing untoward within the reach of its glow, not right then at least. I was still using the flashlight beam as my primary source of illumination.

  Once I got the other candles lit, I sat back down on the couch and turned on a battery-powered radio, an old transistor deal. Hoping to find a local station with some news about the storm, I began tapping the dial across the bandwidth.

  An old radio is a much more subtle device than any newer deck you'll get. Today's models have scan buttons, which locate only relatively clear stations. It's a nice feature when you're driving. But, you might miss something that’s hidden in the fuzz, something ignored by the scanner, something a steady hand capable of tapping a dial back-and-forth, back-and-forth, over a pinpoint can find. Sometimes, you can stumble across conversations from a mobile phone or even a police scanner. Those are a treat. I once discovered a “numbers station”—those radio stations that broadcast an emotionally hollow female voice reciting a series of double-digit numbers. They are, I guess, suspected to be the covert communications from government agencies to spies, domestic and foreign, although no one’s really sure. There’s certainly a prosaic reason for the existence of “numbers stations,” but trust me, your hackles will rise if you ever chance upon one out of the blue.

  That night, I hit on a piece of a broadcast, a voice, startlingly clear for a second, then gone the next. Smiling, I settled myself in to guide it back out of the fuzz. The cat started rubbing up against me, stretching out a paw and meowing for attention. I hadn’t seen her in a couple of days, so I set the radio on the table, picked her up, and put her in my lap to give her a good, solid rub-down.

  I call her “the cat” because she's a stray who had started coming around the yard about three years earlier. She’d been so skinny and ragged-looking that I'd taken to putting out bowls of cat food and water for her. It hadn’t been long before she'd set foot indoors when it was cold or wet or when she’d simply wanted attention. I’d never named her because I figured that one day she’d never show up again, and I hadn’t wanted to feel any attachment to her after she was gone.

  All of the attention I’d given her, of course, had ruined the emotional distance that I’d aimed to establish in the first place. And, as the years rolled on, my affection for her had grown. It tickled me, too, that I was the only person in the world that she seemed to like. She'd hiss, run, and hide or start pawing at the door to go outside when company came over. Once, a woman who considered herself a ""cat-whisperer"" had tried to entice the cat out from under the sofa, convinced that she could bring the hissing little brute around to her way of seeing things.  She’d left with a bruised ego and a scratched wrist. The moment the door had closed behind her, the cat jumped into my lap, purring, everything right with the world again. Could I help but feel flattered?

  The wind's steady persistence in battering the house began to grow notably in force. I continued to stroke the cat, who submitted to my ministrations for a full minute until something caught her attention. Without preamble, she twisted herself upright and leapt onto the floor. Ears perked eagerly forward, she sniffed at the air and then, with cautious, deliberate steps, slinked tentatively toward a corner of the house by the front door.

  By now, my eyes had grown used to the dimness. I rose from the couch and strolled around the room, blowing out every other candle. Waste not, want not. As I snuffed the one that I’d place on the sill of the window that looks out onto the backyard, I swore.

  There was a crack in the glass, a streak of silver bisecting the pane diagonally from the upper corner on one side, all the way down to the lower corner on the other.

  I shook my head. The glass was finished. I supposed I ought to consider myself lucky that half of it hadn’t fallen out and shattered across the floor.

  I looked more closely. The ragged bottom half of the glass was speckled with dried and dusty raindrops. The dark night behind it had turned it into a dim mirror that reflected the last flame of the four-wick candle on the table. And yet, the upper half was so clear that it seemed I must be looking through an open gap in the window frame.

  But that was impossible. If the top half of the pane had been gone, the gales outside would have been howling in my ears, and the rain-soaked gusts of wind would have been smacking me around the face and neck.

  I raised my hand and traced two fingertips from the lower, dirty part of the pane upward over the crack, then took two involuntary steps backward, rubbing the tips of my fingers with my thumb.

  I had expected to confirm the optical illusion for what it was. I had anticipated as I passed my fingers upward. I had expected to find that the upper part of the pane had been slightly dislodged and was tilted at an angle from the window frame. That would have caused light to hit either section at different angles, which would, I supposed, have accounted for the illusion of a broken window.

  However, that’s not what my fingertips found.

  Instead, they traced smooth, unbroken glass. No crack. No sharp edges. No broken angles. Just a windowpane in perfectly good shape. And yet, at the same time, there was something else, just above the image of the crack. Something that I perceived for a quick instant, something that brushed along the whorls of my fingers, very subtly.

  It *was* the sharp, ragged edge of broken glass I had expected to find when a shear moment before I had felt smooth, cool glass. And hairsbreadth higher, I found a gap in the glass, and through that gap a hot, a very hot, a side-of-the-oven-hot breeze that stung the tips of my fingers.

  I again rubbed the side of my thumb against the tips of my fingers, the tingle of that burn cooling to a steel wool scrub before finally settling into a sensation of pins and needles. I couldn't doubt that I'd actually felt the sharp touch of ragged glass, nor the brief scald of impossibly hot wind. Heat or no, broken glass was certainly what my eyes were telling me I ought to have touched. And yet, I couldn't doubt that I'd also traced my fingers along a smooth, cool plane of unbroken glass.

  My mind wrestled with the sensations, as well as with the impossible sight of the broken/not-broken window. Like a double-image on a warped film loop, each condition seemed superimposed upon the other; one would rise to clarity and cancel out the other, and then the process would reverse.

  I shook my head, grasping for some sort of focus that would allow me to understand both states of being at the same time, but a sudden thump from behind threw me from my trance.

  By now, the room was nearly settled in the glow of the heavy, quadruple-wicked candle that rested on top of the coffee table. Beyond it, the cat had found something under a small side table just outside the foyer. Her tail was straight up in the air, and I saw her back legs and shoulders straining as she struggled to drag her prize out into the room.

  With a final, solid tug, she managed to wrench it out of the shadows and into the light. I doubted what I saw. I grabbed the Mag-Lite from the coffee table, aimed it at the cat, and snapped on the beam.

  The moment the light illuminated the floor, the cat skittered backward onto her rump. She gave a yowl of surprise and frustration but was immediately back on her feet and sniffing around where her prize had been.

  She couldn't find it. I couldn't see it anymore. It was gone. The moment the Mag-Lite beam had illuminated it, it had seemed to have just vanished. I swept the beam back and forth across the length of the baseboards. Nothing. But that mystery took second place for the moment to the mystery of the thing I had seen—or thought I had seen—clenched in the cat's teeth as she tried to wrestle it out into the open.

  It had looked like a hunk of meat, of freshly cut pork flank, the kind of thing I prepare at the plant myself: red and raw at one end, white bone cleanly severed in the center, wrapped in a pale, loose sack of pigskin.

  I know what you're thinking, but trust me. I am not the kind of guy who brings his work home with him. And even if I were, I wouldn't let a hank of raw meat lay around in my living room under various and sundry pieces of furniture.

  On the radio, a blast of clarity through the static startled me. It was the unmistakable voice of a woman speaking in the emotionless, no-nonsense tone of a newscaster. At first, I took no notice of her words because something on the wall, mid-height, above the small table that had housed the cat's lost prize, caught my attention.

  It was flat and rectangular, like a medium-sized painting of a landscape or a family portrait. I'd never placed a single decoration on any wall in my house, yet one hung there now. It was neither a landscape nor a portrait. It was a sign with a white background and plain black lettering. It read: 

 

**Official LP Provider**

**Local 151**

 

  I didn't have to raise the Mag-Lite to read it. I might have thought that someone was playing a prank on me—and even if I had, it made no sense anyway; I mean, what the hell was an ""LP Provider?"" —but I knew that the sign had not been hanging on that wall when I came home. I knew that the first time I'd seen it was just now, by the glow of that weird four-pointed candle in the middle of my coffee table.  

  The wind was still battering the house. Spoken words were seeping into my consciousness. It was the voice of the woman on the radio, still droning her news report.

 

  ""*Following unconfirmed reports of hostiles southeast of Bakersfield, local militia plans to create a 'buffer zone' from northern Kern County to southern Orange County*—""

 

  By the off-kilter, warbling glow of that candle, I began to see more. My living room had . . .  distended. Normally, two people might be able to lie head-to-toe across the width of the floor, from the north wall to the south wall. Now, instead of a south wall, against which my television usually sat, there stretched a length of concrete flooring, mottled and untidy, like a foundation laid bare after the carpet had been ripped up.

 

  ""—*might soon march to the mayor's office with the intent to burn it down. The news contained in this dispatch has been re*—""

 

  It was as if the south wall had been knocked down, and I was seeing into the dining room and the kitchen beyond. In fact, it was perfectly like that. The dimensions were the same, and the boards nailed to the wall on the far side would have covered the exact spot where the dining room window would—should—be. Instead of tables and chairs, there stood what looked like a pair of wheeled carts, the same sort of carts you see in hotels that the maids use to push loads of laundry from room to room. The bags held by the carts seemed to be made from a heavy, rough material, like burlap. Dark stains spotted the sides of the material and drenched the bottom. To the right of these carts, in place of the off-white, ceramic tiles that made up the surfaces of the counters in the kitchen, stood, instead, stainless-steel cutting tables. And behind and against the west wall, instead of the stout window and the door to the porch, stood two tall, wide, stainless-steel doors that must have led to a pair of refrigeration units.

 

  ""—*clouds of chlorine gas continue to blow in from the southwest. Citizens are instructed to keep gas masks close at*—""

 

  These images seemed to be melting into my awareness, as if I were only seeing them after I had discovered the absence of what I’d expected to find. As the images began to solidify, sounds began to accompany them, along with the droning voice of the radio's newswoman. And with these sounds and sensations.

  The wind blowing outside sounded louder, as if I were hearing it not through a buffer of walls and glass, but directly. It was as if it had invaded the interior of the house through broken windows, say. The wind had a sizzle to it, which I not only heard riding its gusts but felt against my skin, tingling my arms and the side of my face. I felt it pulling at my clothes and tossing my hair. The two pushcarts squeaked as the wind rocked them gently on their wheels. The boards across the kitchen window rattled.

 

  ""—*estimated thirty-six dead before the riot was brought under control*—""

 

  But above all this I heard another sound, a sound that was frightening for the very reason that it was so familiar. At first, I couldn't accept that I was hearing it at all, that heavy, rhythmic *thump . . .  thump . . .  thump . . .* because I had just left that sound behind, only a few hours earlier. In fact, I had been participating in the making of that sound.

  And as that rhythmic thumping began to push away nearly everything else in my awareness, I began to make out a figure in the kitchen area, among the cutting tables.

  The figure's back was to me. He had broad shoulders and thickly muscled arms. His head was bald, probably shaven. His arms and back were bare underneath the straps and buckles of a heavy leather smock. As I watched, his right hand, encased in a thick black glove, raised to shoulder height. The meat cleaver it held glistened from the process of his work. When the cleaver swiped down, quickly and expertly, upon his work on the table, the muscles in my own arm twitched empathically.

  *Thump* . . .  

  . . . followed by a sharp, splintering *crack*. He pulled a slick hank of meat from its place on the carcass and slid it to the side. It looked exactly like the hunk of meat that the cat had tried to wrestle out from under the side table.

 

  ""—*in direct violation of Tri-County processing and consumption laws*—""

 

  By touch, I switched off the Mag-Lite. I didn't need it anymore, and the echo of its beam formed a dull circle in the center of my vision. I blinked it away and then spotted the cat creeping toward the figure at the cutting table.

  She sprung up onto the metal corner.

 

  ""—*a mass grave containing no less than two dozen heads, accompanied by stripped bones baring the marks of systematic dismemberment and defleshing, along with burn patterns indicative of exposure to flame while still covered with flesh*—""

 

  Meowing, she reached out a paw to bat at the figure's shoulder.

  On the radio, the newswoman's voice was replaced by the slightly more pleasant, though equally no-nonsense toned, voice of a man.

 

  ""*This is a public notice. LP foodstuff is available* legally *only from licensed providers*.""

 

  The figure at the cutting table placed the cleaver on the table, then turned to face the cat. His movements were slow, deliberate. The dim light of the room brought the striated flesh of his right cheek and arm into relief.

 

  ""*Purchase, production, and possession of LP foodstuff not approved by established local authorities will result in penalties*.""

 

  He turned and gazed at the cat for a moment. Then his arm—his butchering arm—began to rise toward the animal, who pawed playfully at it. He pulled the thick glove from his hand and reached around the back of the cat's head, the fingers closing.

""*Cat* . . ."" I tried calling, but my voice came out a dry whisper.

  The cat arched her back. The figure began to stroke her behind the ears. The cat—the same cat who had run and hid when strangers entered the house, who had hissed at and clawed and hated everyone in the world but me—rubbed her cheek up lovingly inside the figure's arm. Even from where I stood, I could hear her deep, devoted purrs.

 

  ""*These penalties may include fines, loss of all meal rights, loss of property, corporeal punishment, community expulsion, and summary execution*""

 

  The figure turned. He looked directly at me. The motion was deliberate, guided, as if he hadn’t needed to wonder whether or not I might be there or to search for me. But rather, he knew how to find me where I stood.

  Even with his face in full view, neither his age—the striations that crisscrossed his skin hid any crow's feet at the corners of his eyes or sags hidden in his jowls—nor his intention revealed themselves to me. My shock and the light from that four-crowned candle smothered everything except for those scars and the sharp, intelligent, and maybe somewhat wild gleam in his eyes.

  I stepped backward.

  He did not blink. He did not twitch.

  He simply sprang.

 

  ""*Public militia, local and county authorities thank you for your compliance and good citizenry*.""

 

  The hand that had been petting the cat, the hand that before had clenched a cleaver to butcher meat, was now stretched out toward me. He was heavier than I was, but there must have been tight muscles under that mass because his work boots clapped in quick succession across the concrete floor as he closed the distance between us. I heard his voice rise in a gravel baritone. The words, I fathomed only later.

  His movement revealed the work splayed across the stainless-steel surface of the cutting table. I saw what it was.

  I twisted to run. My shin barked into the coffee table. I pitched forward, sprawling, my knee coming down hard on the table's edge. The radio flopped face down. The candle rocked on its base. Liquid wax splashed in the melted divots. One after the other, the flames winked out. I scrambled for balance, jarring the table again with an elbow, causing the final flame to gutter. At that moment, I saw a second candle, superimposed over the first, occupying the exact same space. This one was shorter by half. It sported only one wick; all the others had burned away.

  The final flames of both candles guttered in precise tandem and winked out together.

  There's really not much else to tell after that. I scrambled around in the dark, expecting every second to deliver a pair of strong hands clasping my throat. When I found the Mag-Lite, I immediately swung it around like a club, hoping to bludgeon the attacker who was certainly mere inches away from my murder. And when it arched on thin air, I played its beam back and forth across the walls.

I found only my small, tidy living room, marked by a spilled, dead candle spreading chilled splashes of candle wax across the surface of my coffee table. There were no cutting tables in place of the kitchen table, no wheeled carts, no profane meats, and no freezers to preserve them.

  The cat hasn't come home in months. When I need evidence against my own doubts about what I experienced that night, I strike my lighter and hold the flame near one of the wicks of that four-crowned candle. I've never been able to bring myself to light it again.

  I will,l though, one day, I suppose. One day, when things have gotten so terrible, I'll start lighting each wick, one at a time—waste not, want not—and I'll let each burn down until there's only one left to light. I'll watch each burn, and I won't challenge them; I think I may hope for them to burn faster.

  I miss the cat. Stupid, and yet I do. But then we'll be seeing each other again, eventually.

  And I'll need her. When the time is at hand, I will need her to give me presence of mind because I will need to fight against panic and desperation.

  I will remember what the figure yelled as he lunged wildly at me, arms outstretched, hands clutching. But not for me.

  I must let his words echo in my head every day until I call those words myself:

  *Please! The candle! Don't let it go out!*

It sounds completely unnecessary yet he said all the vehicles on the lot have this fee.  It was almost 1k and it was for interior coverage.  Ripped seats, spilled coffee….

I’m more curious about the ones *you* came up with...projects you actually followed through on, even when nobody was asking you to. The kind of thing that came from a spark of motivation (or obsession), kept you up way too late, and maybe taught you a thing or two along the way.

If you’ve got a cool project story, I’d love to hear it. Here are a few things I’d probably ask if we were chatting over coffee (or debugging something at 1am):

* What’s a personal project you actually finished and felt weirdly proud of?
* Did it go according to plan, or did it spiral into something entirely different halfway through?
* How’d you stay motivated when the excitement wore off and it started feeling like work?
* Did you have any “why is this even broken” moments that almost made you rage-quit?
* If you had to do it over again, what would you do differently—besides not starting it at 2am on a Tuesday?
* Did you show it off anywhere or just let it sit quietly on your GitHub like a forgotten plant?
* When you hit that “uhhh I have no idea how to do this” wall, what did you turn to—Google, AI, a friend, blind luck?
* Was there a moment where something finally *clicked* and you felt like a wizard, even briefly?
* If someone else wanted to try a project like yours, what advice would you give them (besides ‘don’t’)?

I’m not looking for polished case studies or side hustle success stories. Just curious how people take an idea and actually make it real. Always cool to hear how it played out.",5,1744124726.0,learnpython,2,1.0,False

- Her jealous male friend said he sees me with different girls every single night. 

- My best friend gossiped and told her I said negative things about her (I didn’t). 

- I went out with her friend at one point and she hates me, so I can naturally assume when they had coffee it wasn’t positive. 

The last time I saw her she was angry but didn’t say why, then sent me a message that we won’t be talking anymore. 

I panicked and sent her an apology which was a mistake. Now what?

First Time posting here, pardon me for any of the mistake I make, nothing as such to get off my chest but just posting this to make sure even If I forget about her sometime in the future this post should remind me that she did something I know no one and I mean No one would ever do.

There was this girl which I kind of I liked but majorly because of her looks, we both were in college thats where I started pursuing her and she had a major heartbreak just few months back and I kind of knew about it but never told her until she was comfortable enough to tell me, we started talking and kept on talking for 9 months, in the start she made it very clear that she is not looking for anything and used to call me bhai and I don't know how but I was pretty sure that I can turn things around, so I just kept talking, short convos turned long, we started meeting in the college secretely during lab lectures, because I didnt wanted anyone to know that I am hitting on her then we kept on talking and she was the kind of girl who won't even shake hands with a boy then around after 8 months we started talking she wished me on my birthday on canteen stairs and shook my hand, so I teased her on that for 2-3 days then in the 10 month (this is december) our semester exam came, and we were sharing notes and helping each other study, she was a topper one day she jokingly asked for chocolates and I got her one and was handing it to her when we were getting out of the class in the corridor but she panicked like someone would see keep it hidden, then I offered it to her when we got outside the college gate, which she accepted and was smiling.

Now we are continously talking from 10 months day and night and comes mid jan and then it happened I confessed to her in the midnight and told her that you are way too good and the guy who will have you as her gf will be very lucky and I am hoping I am that guy, to which she replied 'she is very confused she dont know this is too much all of a sudden' to which I replied 'No issues just had to let you know' and then I stopped talking completely and went on a trip with my friends for 5 days and when I was returning from the trip that day I sent her a video of a coffee cup in the mountains saying 'Le coffee pee le' and to my surpise she was very angry, and I asked her why she said you straight up ghosted me for 5 days, didnt even texted once, I was waiting day and night for your text and so on. And thats what I needed I knew she liked me a lot, she just needed that realisation which the 5 days break gave her. And then it happened we were togather it was like a dream and she was very sweet like the best anyone can get, extremely possesive also but It was only because she loved me very much, and I was so sure like I never felt insecure, never had any doubts even that she might be talking to anyone and even if she did she told me first and even if she didn't I just trusted her. I just trusted her a lot, like she can do anything for me and loved me a lot.

That one quote really felt true with her, **If they love you, you will know it. If they don't, you will constantly wonder if they do.**

We broke up 2 years back, we were togather for 3 years and those were amazing 3 years of my life.


One particular thing that will always stay with me and I can bet on my life no woman in the world would do this for me was when we used to do it and once we finished I was always covered in sweat, on my face, my body and so was she, but instead of fixing herself up, she used to turn the fan on, reduced the AC temp, and take my head in her lap and wipe my sweat with her Tshirt or any piece of clothing she could get and used to fan me with hand, Idk I just can't forget that effort and she used to do it almost every time I sweated even though we aren't togather anymore but she was just different. She was just totally different.


**TLDR** - No TLDR just writing this post So in the future if I forget about her which I know I won't, this post will remind of what a extremely sweet and beautiful woman she was.",4,1744124686.0,OffMyChestIndia,1,1.0,False

We were friends outside of work too, for a while. Sam struggles mentally, and often needs a verbal outlet for her thoughts. She's neurodivergent, so I know she doesn't always recognise boundaries unless I tell them to her (to a degree, of course). I was patient with her, and talked her through a couple of boundaries, but I found myself distancing from her. 

A few months ago, she overstepped. She told me she was going to attempt s*icide in front of her father, in order to ""prove a point"" and get him to listen. Obviously, I was worried about her, and convinced her to go to the hospital after she'd finished college. She agreed. When I asked for an update a little later on, she told me ""my friend told me not to"", and went on to relay a conversation between herself and another friend. She then had a rational conversation with her father. I explained to her that I was glad she was safe, but a few days later, I explained to her that I needed to pull away from her because, as you can imagine, she'd put me through a lot of unnecessary worry over ""proving a point"". 

At the end of last year, something happened to me which caused me to lose my job. It really put things into perspective for me, and I began rethinking relationships and friendships. I felt I needed to reconcile with Sam, or at least be on mote amicable terms. We met up for coffee, I told her what had happened and she filled me in on her life. Things seemed fine, and more importantly, mutual. 

Since then, she's started talking at me again, venting and just telling me a lot of unnecessary details. I've tried not responding in depth, but it's had no effect. Recently, we went bowling, and she told me about a situation with her worklife. I gave her my opinion, and pointed out how badly the company was treating its staff (from both her recount and online reviews). She spent the next day telling me about how she was planning on applying for another job within the company, which I'd advised her against the night before. (It's also worth noting that, when I disclosed how much I'd been struggling myself for the past few months, she barely seemed to register, and continued to talk about herself.) 

Last night, she messed me to say ""I've really messed up"". I know she has other people to talk to, I was busy, and didn't want to keep devoting my time to reassuring her, or letting her vent. This morning, when she saw I hadn't responded, she went ahead with saying what her dad thought of whatever had happened, and that her dad pointed out it was wrong. I said I was confused, so she sent me a 5-minute-long voice note. Half of the voice note was actually explaining what had happened, and the other half was her telling me about things she'd done and realised in therapy. I responded with my opinion, and she just sent me a message that fills up the entire screen, only some of which is actually about the situation. 

I'm exhausted with this friendship. I feel guilty, because I was the one who reached out, but I don't want someone who talks *at* me like I'm a soundboard.

The ravages of the hyperspace sea were kept at bay by *The Long Way's* hyperdrive projecting a bubble of reality around her in a dazzling spray of colors across the visible light spectrum in swirling kaleidoscope chaos.  This was simply how hyperdrives worked, and the light show had passed into an unremarked fact of life by most spacefarers in centuries gone by.  However, some shipbuilders still insisted on installing viewports and viewscreens for the express purpose of letting those who sail look upon the vastness of space, and the turbulent tumbling unknown of hyperspace.  *The Long Way was such a ship.  Her small size worked against her, and left only two small viewports in the cabins in addition to the main viewscreens on the bridge, but that main viewscreen was plenty for Jason George.
 
Family lore held that George men were ever moved by the sight as far back as the Burning of Ignitia, or maybe earlier.  Family lore held that Gregory George himself sought solace in the sight of the colorful sea slipping by when he was stranded far from home among Terra's first friends among the stars.  Family lore further held that Eric George found comfort from an ""unauthorized windows"" aboard the *Robin Williams* herself when he got the dreadful news of the *Among the Star Tides We Sing's* grisly fate.  Family lore held, and some photos proved, that Peter George proposed to Emely Sullivan in front of the biggest viewport he could find.  More names besides were mentioned in family lore, and Jason's own father often found ways to sit and sip at a mug of coffee as he watched the enchanting sight.  Jason himself had fallen in love with the ever changing sight clutching hot cocoa in a half-circle of older cousins clutching their own mugs of steaming hot cocoa at Grandpap's knee, and the old man himself had often let his gaze wander from the faces of his audience to the self-same viewport they'd gathered around.  All of that did little to explain why he found the sight so enchanting, so calming, only that he wasn't alone in his feelings.  Sometimes when he was on his watch on the bridge, Jason could almost believe that he could see the clear way home in the chaos.  On his watch like he was at that moment.
 
On that watch, the hyperspace sea kept its secrets.
 
Instead, the hatch leading to the galley cycled, and a nervous girl's voice asked, ""May I join you for a time?""
 
""Hey Isis-Magdalene, did you get tired of avoiding me?"" he asked in returned.
 
""It seemed to me that your wroth was long in cooling these past days,"" she answered with a defensive tinge to her voice, ""yet you have yet to answer.""
 
""Aye, you may.  I wanted to talk to you too, but I'll hear you out first.""
 
""Why should it be that I speak first?""
 
""Because it's only polite, you screwed up your courage to come to me first, after all,"" Jason explained, ""no shouting, no glares, and no name-calling.  I promise.""
 
Isis-Magdalene carefully edged around the tight bridge and sat in Vincent's seat.  Then, she carefully rearranged the pleats of her dress, fixed her hair, took a deep breath, rearranged her dress again, checked her reflection in an inactive screen, and took another deep breath.  Jason valiantly suppressed his mirth, and she began, ""I behaved shamefully to you during crisis.  I became afraid and sought to cover my fear with indignation at the manner you discharged your duty and expected you to bear such a tantrum in silence.  Worse, when you did not, I let my own wroth be stirred against someone I thought shall not meet my anger with resistance when you left.  You had already made it clear to me that the prerogatives and duties of my house do not apply, but I still made demands of you in regards to my station and dignity.  For all this I have sorrow and now do make apologies.""
 
""Forgiven,"" Jason said without hesitation before asking, ""and what else?""
 
The girl looked to Jason with open bewilderment on her face and rejoined, ""That simply?  I make apologies and you forgive?""
 
Jason mightily suppressed a bemused bark of laughter and reposted, ""Why oughtn't it be that simple?""
 
""I…"" she began as the flush of embarrassment crept up her cheeks, ""I know not.  It seemed to me that your wroth was very great so I had expected to make some kind of amending.""
 
""As has been done for me, so I do for others, and if God Himself can forgive even wretched mankind, who am I to refuse something so simple?""
 
The understanding broke through as she nodded, ""You are a disciple of Christ.""
 
""Aye, that I am.  I do my best, anyhow.""
 
""I… this…"" she began and trailed off.
 
""Take your time,"" Jason told her.
 
""Recall your promise.""
 
Jason nodded to her gravelly and repeated, ""No shouting, no glares, and no name-calling.""
 
""When I called you 'Keeper of Oaths,' you became very wroth with me.  I have tried to ask others why you found it so insulting, but… Trandrai tells me that I have no rights to lay such a thing on your shoulders and shall speak no more, Vai speaks much the same, Cadet tells me he does not understand, and Vincent says that I must speak with you to understand.  Please, tell me what I have done wrong, for I do not understand.""
 
Jason kept his word, he kept his face and voice carefully blank as he said with an iron calm of will, ""That will take a bit to explain.  Can you bear with me?""
 
""Please, I shall do my utmost.""
 
""When I say Admiral Nelson Jock, Captain Lina Chen, Corporal Jax Stormborn, Captain Mark Ramirez and Sergeant Thomas Mitchel, what do you think?""
 
Isis-Magdalene furrowed her brow at Jason and made little effort to hide her confusion as she tentatively guessed, ""Republican servicemen?""
 
""Most, but not all.  Heroes all.  But if I say Major General Eric George, Captain John George, Sergeant Linus George, and Corporal Peter George, what do you think?""
 
""The Breakers of Chains,"" she answered in a reverent whisper.
 
""What do you suppose those four have in common with the folks you never heard of?""
 
""Did they also serve in the Dominion War?""
 
""Aye, some of them were even at the Battle of the Imperial Palace.""
 
""Jason, I did say I shall bear with you, but my confusion has only grown.""
 
""Why are just *my* family the chain breakers?  Do you suppose they did it all by themselves?  Do you suppose anybody does anything on his own?  Everybody needs help from friends, from kinfolk, sometimes even from strangers, and all they did was their little bit of a great deed, but people like you saddle them with titles and call them heroes without a thought about what they'd want.  Then, you go and try and shove a title on me when all I did was help you get buckled, and I just don't figure it's that heroic.""
 
Isis-Magdalene gulped audibly before she told him, ""This was not my intention.""
 
Jason let out a rueful sigh and reassured her, ""I figured on that later.""
 
""I… may I… I mean to say that I wish-""
 
""I'm still hearing you out.  If you want to say something, I'll listen.""
 
Isis-Magdalene crossed her ankles, crossed them the other way, ran a thumb over her left elbow horn, crossed her ankles the other way again and began, ""You may not believe this, but some amongst the nobility can look upon another and… and gain a sense of a kind of the… the shape of another's spirit.  Or mind, or perhaps some other word in this tongue should fit better.  What sort of person they are.  This is not very precise, and some have lesser or greater talent, and many have trouble for races other than the Axxaakk.  I however, have some small talent in that direction above what is usual, and I look upon you, and unbidden comes the thought 'this one shall never break a vow, he can be well trusted,' and that is why I called you such.""
 
""No George has ever gone back on his or her word,"" Jason said off-handedly as his gaze drifted once again to the swirling colors of hyperspace travel, ""and I'm certainly not going to break the streak.  But please, let the heroic nicknames lie.  I'm Jason.  I'm only me.""
 
""I… I do believe that is all I wished to speak of.  You did say that you wish to speak of something.""
 
Jason suppressed another sigh and said, ""Aye, it's not exactly unrelated.  I'm sorry for losing my temper with you and shouting, and for threatening to call you Princess Fussy  pants, and for taking so long to apologize.""
 
""I did avoid you by purpose,"" she admitted.
 
""True, but I'm sorry.  I was sore with you, and I was stressed out, but that's no excuse.  I should have been more patient with you and extended you a little understanding.""
 
""I… please, let your sorrow fade.  I hold you blameless.""
 
""Thank you, I'll take that as forgiveness.  I'll try not to lose my temper like that again.  There's something else.""
 
""What is it?""
 
""You weren't the only student taken, were you?""
 
""No.  No, I was not.""
 
""Wanna talk it over?""
 
Isis-Magdalene clutched her elbow horns in her hands and drew in on herself before she said hollowly, ""No, I do not.""
 
""Then just listen to this.  By every drop pod ever launched, by every headstone on Repose, by every baby's laugh, by the very seas of Terra herself and the stars God Himself put in the void, I will never let them take you again.""
 
Jason very carefully didn't see the tears rolling down her cheeks as she said, ""I believe you.""
 
The galley lights illuminated the counter and cooktop where Trandrai was helping Vai prepare a large haunch of game for roasting over a bed of foraged taproot vegetables that Vincent thought tasted a bit like parsnips.  Vai sometimes cast worried glances toward the hatch leading to the cockpit.  Cadet, having nothing to distract him on the other hand, stared intently at the hatch from his seat on the sofa.  Vincent admitted, privately in his own head, that he let his gaze fall upon the closed hatch from where he lounged across a goodly two thirds of the sofa from time to time with a mix of expectation and worry both.
 
""What if she's being mean in there?"" Cadet asked without preamble.
 
""Then Jason will handle it,"" Vincent gruffly said as he picked up one of his tablets and loaded up where he'd left off in reading *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.*
 
""Handle it how?"" Cadet asked with all of his customary grace, ""He says that he won't hit a girl.""
 
""If she won't start being nice to Jason, *I'll* hit her,"" Trandrai darkly muttered from the kitchen area of the galley.
 
""You?"" Cadet shot back with again, all of the grace and candor in his incredulous tone he had become known for.
 
""I could hit somebody if I was mad enough,"" Trandrai declared defensively.
 
Three sets of unbelieving eyes fell on her in silent reply.
 
""I could use a wrench!"" she insisted.
 
""What if you miss and hit *The Long Way* instead?"" Vai asked quietly.
 
""Well, maybe not a wrench… I could slap her,"" Trandrai conceded.
 
""Tran,"" Vincent said evenly from behind his tablet, ""no screwing yourself up for violence.  Jason can handle people being rude to him without hitting them.""
 
Trandrai returned to peeling the parsnip-like things as her blue skin flushed lilac around her cheeks and ears as she muttered, ""Oh, that's right.  Jason can handle it, that's why you told her to just talk to him…""
 
""Clever girl,"" Vincent agreed and nudged Cadet with his foot before telling him, ""you try not to worry so much.  This is the kind of thing Jason's good at.""
 
Cadet grunted by way of reply, and *The Long Way's* constant humming drone filled the silence with her cozy, close comfort despite the friction felt by her crew over the past few days.  At length, he said, ""Vincent, what is a hero?""
 
""You have a talent for tough questions, kid,"" Vincent grumbled as he gave up on reading and laid his tablet aside to sit up and think.
 
""That isn't an answer,"" the boy helpfully pointed out with the azure feathers across his face beginning to bristle and stand in irritation.
 
""I know, kid.  Give me a minute,"" Vincent said as he struggled to pull his thoughts together on an answer.
 
""I asked Jason a while back, and he just said he doesn't want to be one,"" Cadet elaborated, his plumage lying back in as a more patient calm came over him again.
 
""In his world, heroes are people who make sacrifices for other people.  Sometimes their lives.  In Jason's world, heroes do the right thing even when it kills them, and only get the peace they deserve when they reach their last day, so I guess he wouldn't think being a hero is very attractive,"" Vincent mused, still looking for his own answer.
 
Trandrai nodded gravely from the kitchen while Vai froze mid-seasoning, and Cadet pressed, ""But I want to know what you think a hero is.""
 
""Still working on that, kid.  It's a hard question to answer.""
 
""I know, if I could figure it out, I wouldn't have asked.""
 
Vincent drummed his fingers on the sofa's armrest and felt his left ear twitching as he began to get an idea of an answer, ""Do you remember how to know what the right thing to do is?""
 
""Do unto others,"" Cadet answered with a full body ruffle of his feathers.
 
""Yeah, well.  Most people try to do the right thing most of the time, and usually don't do the wrong thing.  Most people can do the right thing reliably when things are good, when things are easy.  When things are hard, when it's dangerous, or hard to figure out, most people just try to not do the wrong thing, even when they can see what the right thing to do is.  They don't do the right thing because they're too afraid, or don't believe they can do it, or don't think it'll make enough of a difference.  Heroes look at the costs, look at their fear, and do the right thing anyway.""
 
Cadet appraised Vincent with one eye, and then the other in the way he did when he was thinking something over before he asked, ""Doesn't that make you a hero?""
 
""I don't know,"" Vincent admitted with unconcern, ""maybe.  Maybe not.  I do my best to do the right thing, sure, but I don't know about heroic.""
 
Cadet narrowed his eyes at Vincent once again and said, ""But you did the right thing for us, when just not doing the wrong thing would have been easier.""
 
Vincent drummed is fingers on the sofa's armrest for a couple seconds again, and listened to the gentle humming of *The Long Way* as he thought about his answer.  ""Listen kid,"" he grunted, ""you're going to have to bear with me.  I'm not good at, ah you've heard that before.  I mean I can't really know if I'm a hero or not since it's not really up to me.""
 
""What do you mean?  You do things that heroes do, and that makes you a hero, right?"" Cadet asked in the tones of a boy trying to square a circle.
 
""Well sure, but it's also not really up to me whether what I did is heroic or not.  That's up to, well in this case, I guess it's up to you guys.  I made my choices, I tried to make them the right ones, but I cannot control what you think about that.""
 
""So… you don't really get a choice about being a hero or not?"" Cadet asked with a thin edge of anger creeping into his voice.
 
""Well, I can decide to be courageous, or cowardly, or kind, or cruel, but whether I'm a hero is a judgement.  Something that other people figure out.  If you think I'm a hero, then I'm a hero to you.  What I think about that is up to me.""
 
""Oh.  What if you are a hero to me?""
 
""Then, thank you,"" Vincent told him seriously.
 
Vincent's canine hearing didn't miss Vai's whisper of, ""Poor Jason.""
 
So far as reactors and hyperdrives went, *The Long Way* was quiet.  So quiet that Jason thought her soft-spoken, even in her engine room where her systems were the loudest.  It wasn't his favorite haunt, but Trandrai was down there by herself again, and they still had eight days until the scheduled translation to realspace.  Everybody else, even Vincent, assumed she was studying the alien yoke in case they managed to capture something else of the enemy's.  Jason knew his cousin a little better than that though, and he knew that she was doing little more than fiddling with it in solitude.  Even still, when he climbed down the ladder he opened with, ""Any progress, Tran?""
 
She laid a screwdriver on the bench and propped her head in her two left hands as she answered, ""Little.""
 
""Are you trying for any?"" Jason asked as he closed the distance and leaned against the workbench to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with her.
 
""Not really,"" she admitted.
 
""When Via figures out you're coming down here to be alone, she's gonna get worried,"" Jason said with an off-handed tone as he reached out to gently probe a component of the yoke with a finger.
 
""I can't figure out what that does either,"" Trandrai said simply, then after a beat she said, ""she won't think I want to get away from her, will she?""
 
""She might.  She's pretty sensitive, and she works hard to make sure we know she likes us,"" Jason said as he nudged the whole yoke on the bench to rotate it.
 
""Oh…"" Trandrai murmured, ""what about the others?""
 
""Uncle Vincent will think you should be allowed your space if that's what you want, and Cadet has to be told when there's something we do together since he's so used to being on his own.""
 
""What about… the other one?""
 
Jason kept his eyebrows from rising as he asked by way of reply, ""Do you care?""
 
Trandrai shifted her weight from one foot to the other before she answered, ""Just say what you think.""
 
""Isis-Magdalene hasn't told me what she thinks of anybody,"" Jason reported, and Trandrai finally looked up to show him her deeply worried eyes, ""she and I made up.  We're not sore at each other anymore, and we're trying to get along.  What about you?""
 
""I think I might dislike her,"" Trandrai admitted in a low mumble.
 
Jason raised an eyebrow at her and asked, ""Dislike her?""
 
Trandrai spun the screwdriver on the bench with a rolling clatter and witched it spin until it stopped before she said, ""She comes to our decks as castaway, and having received and accepted the guest-right she demands more because of her station, whatever that means, offers insults to you, to Vai, and dishonors *The Long Way* too.  She does nothing, says little, and merely sits like a lump looking down her nose at us.  Duels have ben fought for less!""
 
""You've gone from disliking her to wanting to duel her,"" Jason said with a wry grin twisting his lips.
 
""Well, maybe I shan't duel her,"" Trandrai admitted with a failed attempt at a scowl toward her older cousin, ""but still, it is irritating.""
 
""Her people don't know much about ship's honor, Tran,"" Jason said gently, ""if you want an apology-""
 
Trandrai inturrupted with a frustrated slap onto the bench and said, ""She's a good ship.  She's a good ship who's just now re-learning joy, and here she comes… and then she says those things to you and, and, and, Cadet wants to know what a hero even is…""
 
""Tran,"" Jason began again, a little more firmly but no less gently, ""do you think she owes you an apology?""
 
""Yes!  No, maybe not.  I don't know, Jason,"" Trandrai said with dwindling heat as she spun the screwdriver again.
 
""So, what do you want?""
 
""I want…"" Trandrai began softly, hesitantly, ""things to be like before she came aboard.""
 
""Tran,"" Jason began, and tried to keep the pain in his heart out of his voice.
 
He must have failed because Trandrai quickly said with alarm, ""I don't mean I want to get rid of her!  Just… things are different now… and I… I… I made friends and… you were… you were proud… of me.""
 
""Am proud of you,"" Jason corrected, ""I am proud of you.""
 
""I… thank you, Jason.  Thank you.""
 
""Maybe Isis-Magdalene would have more to say if somebody would talk to her,"" Jason mused.
 
""I wish somebody would,"" Trandrai muttered darkly.
 
""Courage,"" Jason said with a smile, and clapped her on the shoulder, ""you just need to gather a little courage.  I'll be here for you either way.""
 
""Me?!"" she asked with growing alarm.
 
""Aye, you.  Courage.""
 
She attempted to scowl at him again.  She failed again.
 
Meanwhile above decks, at the aft of the ship Vincent stood outside the airlock looking at a battered cardboard box sitting on the floor just inside the open inner door.  He looked at the vital supplies within.  He shut the door with a tap at the control panel, and his clawed finger trembled a quarter of an inch away from his target.  He took a deep steadying breath, and opened the outer door without depressurizing the airlock first, jettisoning the box of supplies within.  Vincent didn't need to see the bottles collide with the swirling chaos of hyperspace at the edge of the bubble of reality around *The Long Way* and be atomized.  He knew it happened, and that was enough.  Heroes did what was right, even when it hurt.

All I remember in the music video is… a guy arrives to his apartment towards the end of the day, i am assuming from work. He looks out his window, and he's able to see the inside of another apartment. He notices a lady in the other apartment also arriving home. Again, assuming from work. She puts on some over the ear headphones, she unbuttons her white blouse and just starts dancing. She has a black bra and a skirt. And that's basically the music video, she's just dancing and the guy can't look away. Towards the end tho, the dude starts seeing her everywhere in his apartment, like mini versions of her. Like I remember there was a moment he opens his fridge and she's on top of a beverage, sitting and just looking at him, he looks away and she's in his coffee table (I think). The music video ends by going to complete static, as she's leaning in to kiss him (I think). The genre is like techno/electronic/EDM.

We were friends outside of work too, for a while. Stacey struggles mentally, and often needs a verbal outlet for her thoughts. She's neurodivergent, so I know she doesn't always recognise boundaries unless I tell them to her (to a degree, of course). I was patient with her, and talked her through a couple of boundaries, but I found myself distancing from her. 

A few months ago, she overstepped. She told me she was going to attempt s*icide in front of her father, in order to ""prove a point"" and get him to listen. Obviously, I was worried about her, and convinced her to go to the hospital after she'd finished college. She agreed. When I asked for an update a little later on, she told me ""my friend told me not to"", and went on to relay a conversation between herself and another friend. She then had a rational conversation with her father. I explained to her that I was glad she was safe, but a few days later, I explained to her that I needed to pull away from her because, as you can imagine, she'd put me through a lot of unnecessary worry over ""proving a point"". 

At the end of last year, something happened to me which caused me to lose my job. It really put things into perspective for me, and I began rethinking relationships and friendships. I felt I needed to reconcile with Stacey, or at least be on mote amicable terms. We met up for coffee, I told her what had happened and she filled me in on her life. Things seemed fine, and more importantly, mutual. 

Since then, she's started talking at me again, venting and just telling me a lot of unnecessary details. I've tried not responding in depth, but it's had no effect. Recently, we went bowling, and she told me about a situation with her worklife. I gave her my opinion, and pointed out how badly the company was treating its staff (from both her recount and online reviews). She spent the next day telling me about how she was planning on applying for another job within the company, which I'd advised her against the night before. (It's also worth noting that, when I disclosed how much I'd been struggling myself for the past few months, she barely seemed to register, and continued to talk about herself.) 

Last night, she messed me to say ""I've really messed up"". I know she has other people to talk to, I was busy, and didn't want to keep devoting my time to reassuring her, or letting her vent. This morning, when she saw I hadn't responded, she went ahead with saying what her dad thought of whatever had happened, and that her dad pointed out it was wrong. I said I was confused, so she sent me a 5-minute-long voice note. Half of the voice note was actually explaining what had happened, and the other half was her telling me about things she'd done and realised in therapy. I responded with my opinion, and she just sent me a message that fills up the entire screen, only some of which is actually about the situation. 

I'm exhausted with this friendship. I feel guilty, because I was the one who reached out, but I don't want someone who talks *at* me like I'm a soundboard.

Revenge story.","**Before you read - THIS IS A REALLY REALLY LONG STORY**

**I truly spare no detail. I am giving you the full backstory, all the drama, all the twists and turns and everything that happens. All the people, all the opinions. It's a story about a girl who was all around messy, stupid, a compulsive liar most likely and how she basically destroyed her life.**

**My revenge isn't that petty, because she pretty much did everything herself, but I was still satisfied and it filled my revenge cup.** 

I also apologise for any spelling errors, weird sentences and all that, this was a book to write. My fingers hurt. Now start the story, let's go.

Hello,

Been thinking of posting this story on here for a while, since I got my fair share of petty points for doing what I did. But also, she deserved it, so not even sorry. Maybe someone will get a kick out of it. I have been told before to post this story on reddit and now I am ready to share.

This all happened about 3 years ago. I (F24 at the time) was together with my then boyfriend (he is now an ex, but it's unrelated to the story) (M25 at the time) Chris. He had a work friend about the same age as us, honestly can't remember her exact age, but around 24-25 at the time, same as ours. Let's call her Dana.

Since Chris worked as a delivery driver for a really big delivery company here in my country, I spent some of my free days just driving around in the passengers seat of his delivery van. We had fun, snacks and music. I liked being a passenger princess. Dana was his colleague, also a delivery driver for the same company, doing the exact same job, just delivering packages to a different area in the city. They had become really good friends (just platonic) so some mornings when they waited for their vans to be loaded, I saw her around and eventually we started talking and really hit it off.

All three of us started to hang out together. Dana was a real extrovert - loud, always laughing about everything, loved to be the centre of attention, a little too much alcohol usage for everyday (but I ain't a judge), loved attention from men, and all that. But at the same time it was fun with her, she was a friend you could call and know that she would be down for whatever. We all went to car shows together, friend gatherings, swimming, fishing (my boyfriend loved it, we just hung out somewhere near), just driving around the city at night, etc. Sometimes me and her would talk about our experiences, relationships, drama, trauma and all that. She and I shared some similar experiences and relationship and family traumas, so we really connected. To not make this longer - our trio became really good friends. A couple of months go by.

Enter another character from Chris's work - Jack. Also the same job, also a car guy, like my boyfriend, so he started to hang with us sometimes as well. If I am not mistaken they knew each other beforehand and Chris got him a job there, since it was great and the pay was pretty nice. Since they started working together, Chris and him would hang around pretty much every day around their cars (they both had BMW's and were practically married to their cars). Jack started to like Dana. She wasn't his usual type, he was more of a blonde, skinny, demure, girly girl kinda guy, and Dana was the exact opposite - fire red hair, a noticeably big girl and definitely not demure or girly. Her style was a lot of makeup, black see-through tops and leather shorts.

Now we are pretty much a four person friend group. Me and my boyfriend, Jack and Dana. Jack was trying to get Dana's attention and she was loving it. He would pay for her drinks, food, would take her on drives in his car, they are texting, meeting, stuff is happening. Me and my boyfriend are happy, it would be pretty cool if they got together.

Me and Dana would also text and talk a lot in private without the boys. One evening when she is at our place I asked how are things going with Jack. She opens up, that she doesn't really like him. He is not her type at all, but she likes the attention and he is really nice towards her. They go out and drive around practically every night, talking and such. She feels safe with him, he has openly expressed that he likes her and maybe would like something more. She is still ''thinking'' about that in his eyes, but her mind is pretty much set that nothing more is going to happen.

I was kind of disappointed. Not because she didn't like him, frankly I didn't care about that, you can't change the way you feel about a person. If you don't like someone romantically that is completely fine. But I was disappointed because she let this just go on for this long. Kind of stringing him along and not saying anything. I, of course, talk to Chris about this, since we talked about everything. His opinion was to just let that conversation go, they will figure it out themselves. I am on board with that, I also don't want to start any unnecessary drama. Not my place.

So for the next month or so, me and Chris, we know nothing. Jack is sometimes asking Chris or me some questions trying to get out of us some information whether Dana likes him at all, and we just tell him that she doesn't really say much. And that was kind of true, because after me and Dana talked about Jack that one time, we never really brought it up again. We all just continued to hang out. When all of us were together, you would think that Dana and Jack were a couple, sometimes even more of a couple than me and Chris. They have kissed, but they were not together officially. Don't know about s\*x.

One evening mine and Chris's phone is BLOWING up. It's Dana. She wants to meet. She sounded really distressed on the phone call. Ok. We jump in the car and go to her place. She comes outside her apartment building and jumps in our car. We see that she has been crying, makeup all smudged. She tells us that her BOYFRIEND broke up with her.

I didn't know she had a boyfriend. Other than Jack, who could be maybe considered as one. But it turns out all this time she had a boyfriend (let's call him Tom). Chris also knew nothing of that. He remembered that some time ago, before Jack was in the scene, Dana used to casually refer to dating their colleague Tom, but it never really went anywhere and she stopped bringing him up, so he just assumed there was nothing there. And he and Tom are not really close at work. But in reality she and Tom were fully together, she moved in with him and all that. They were together for 8 months. And now that Tom broke up with her, she has nowhere to go and is crying in our car and begging for our help, since she is now homeless.

While she was crying in our car, she also opened up about other things in her life. She tells us that she is also leaving her job. That almost two weeks ago she handed in her two weeks notice and that she has to work only one more shift. She hated her job and was tired of it, so decided to quit and search for another job. Tom told her he would support her in the meantime. Me and Chris, we both knew that she had issues with money, she had told us before, but we really didn't know the extent of that. According to her, when she was about 18 or something, her then boyfriend had taken multiple loans on her name and she is still paying them off and pretty much living on nothing. She didn't exactly say how much, but after some beating around the bush we gathered that it could be well over 10k. (for us it is a lot) So, she is in big debt and has nowhere to live and no money and no job.

At this moment I really felt for this girl.

Now some context on me and my living situation, cause it's important to the story.

Before me and Chris were together I used to live alone in an apartment. My dad bought it for me in the city if I ever went to college or something, so he let me live there, while he lived elsewhere. I loved that apartment. It was small, one bedroom, not anything fancy, needed some work, but I don't really need much. When I started dating Chris, I kind of moved in with him without even noticing. You know how that happens. You pack a bag to stay with your boyfriend for a couple of days and then you just never really leave... We just went there to grab my things once in a while and to water my houseplants, because I had A LOT of them at the time. Sooooooo no one lived in that apartment. I still paid all the bills and most of my stuff was there. Bills were nothing much, since no electricity or water was used and I didn't have to pay any rent, my dad owned it.

Now back to the story.

I offered for her to stay in my apartment. It was actually pretty logical for me. She could move in there, she wouldn't have to pay me any rent, just pay the utility bills (all together around 100 Euros a month, really cheap), water my houseplants once a week, she would have pretty much her own place. Even if she doesn't find a job right away it's fine. She could pay me back those utility bills, when she got back on her feet. We would think of something. I would let her stay for as long as she needs. She can fully live there, unpack with ease. I wouldn't have to go there, she can just live there and it's all fine. I understand her situation, I have been in the similar ones, I wanted to be a good friend and help. I tell her about my place, that it's not a fancy apartment, but still ok. Furniture is pretty old, most of it is from the time I was a baby (so more than 20 years old). The fridge is 20 years old, but works wonderfully. It hasn't been renovated in a while, so walls and floor are not aesthetic in any way, but the furniture is actually nice, I have everything I need in life and kitchen is pretty cool. My favorite room. And I have a lot of houseplants so it looks pretty nice. I did my best to make it feel like a home. Also me and Chris are pretty serious at this point, so I would feel safe if I moved in with him permanently. I was living with him for 6-7 months at that point anyway.

I also told her some rules, if she decides to say yes.

1. No smoking cigarettes inside (she did sometimes smoke them)
2. No new people

Only two rules. I think both are pretty self explanatory. Maybe ''no new people'' would raise some questions, but I am a pretty private person and I rarely bring someone I don't know to my apartment. And since I know that she loves attention from men and occasional one night stands, plus she is recently broken up with, I didn't want strange men in my apartment. Just because it's still my home and some of my most important things are there.

She took my offer and we talked about what needed to be done, so by tomorrows evening she and her stuff can be there.

We took her to our place to stay the night and next day we went back to Tom's to get her stuff. She mostly sat around on Tom's bed and cried, while me and Chris packed her stuff and took it to our cars. Then with two cars and all of her stuff we all went to my apartment.

My apartment is on the 5th floor with no elevator. For me it was never really an issue. Our first journey up the stairs she already said some snarky stuff about it being on the 5th floor and now she will have to walk flights of stairs every day. I just brushed it off. Mind you, she didn't even help us take her stuff up. She just went up and sat on my bed. Still crying, still depressed.

While she is sitting on the bed crying and stress eating a taco, I am doing some reorganising. Taking my clothes out of the closet, so she has closet space, cleaning out some drawers, all that. I packed most of my stuff away, where it wouldn't get in the way of normal living. Chris is walking up and down the stairs with her stuff. Plopping it all in a pile on the living room floor. Exhausted. At this point he has carried all her stuff up. 5th floor.

I talk a little with Dana, while she starts putting some stuff away and commenting on the size of my apartment. A lot of snarky comments, but again I brush it off. I tell her little about how to pay for utilities, ask her to water my plants once a week, we talk about keys (I only had one set, so Chris quickly ran to make another copy), mail, cleaning stuff, all the things you would talk about when leaving someone to live in your apartment. I tell her to text me if she has any questions. After all that me and Chris head back home.

I text with her for the next couple of days. She seems fine. We periodically try to get her out of the house, but she just comes once. We went for a drive, it was actually fun. I asked how was everything with Jack, she tells us that everything is fine and they are still friends. From Chris I knew that he told Jack everything. About Tom, about job, about moving. He was pretty shocked and disappointed, but didn't look surprised.

After this we all kind of started living our lives. Chris and Jack were still colleagues and friends and would meet up regularly, me and Dana are talking every day. One night I tell her I remembered that she could file for insolvency. Where we live you can file for insolvency if you are in big debt and just can't pay it back. There are some rules, but I remember that she checked all the boxes and in that case her debt would all be wiped to almost nothing. She had to pay something, but it was comparatively nothing. To my surprise she didn't want to do it. She didn't want to go through the hassle with lawyers and meetings and judge and all that. For the next couple of days I tried to persuade her. I laid out all the positives. I googled and found a good lawyer who offered a free consultation about that exact problem.

She finally gave in and went to the consultation. And thanks to that that consultation and some paperwork she basically erased her debt.

We knew that she and Jack are spending most of the evenings together. She told us about this great job, that one of her friends got her in a pretty big company and things start to look up. Sometimes we even go for a drive, go to mcdonalds, or take a little trip together. One night we were all at a car meet, where she got drunk, met a guy and went home with him. For the record, I wouldn't have let her go anywhere with a random guy drunk, but she slipped away from me that night and I couldn't do anything. Everything was fine though, they went to his place and had a hook up. I get it, recently single I guess.

Anyway. A little over a month goes by.

One night I look at my utility bills online and I notice she hasn't paid. There are two invoices that she would have to pay, and both are still outstanding. One is pretty fresh, so that would be fine, but the other one is already red. I text her to ask if she will do it and when, because every day that you don't pay your red invoice, it grows. I notice she also hasn't paid for both electricity bills.

I text. She doesn't answer. I see her online. That whole evening she is online, but not reading my message. It starts getting sketchy for me. I talk it out with Chris and we decide to wait till tomorrow. But I already feel in my gut that some shit is about to go down. I just know she is not going to pay me.

**Before any of you say anything - yes, it was my mistake for not signing any kind of lease or agreement with her. I know that. And I will never make this mistake again. And let this be a lesson to you as well. I should have signed some form of sublease agreement or something, so that situation like this could be avoided. But at the same time - I regret nothing. I saw her true colors, and I got my revenge.**

The next day - no answer. I text again. The same thing happens, no response. Chris texts her. Also nothing. She is online on Whatsapp constantly, but doesn't read any of our messages.

I start to worry, what do I do. I pay all bills so they don't get bigger and I send her a message, that I did so. Also, you now owe me (insert whatever amount that was). If I remember correctly it was around 170 Euros all together.

Still no response for like a week.

While that is all happening Chris and Jack are living their regular lives as well, but one thing is different. Jack refuses to talk about Dana at all. Chris tries to throw in that Dana is being an a-hole for not responding to me about bills, but Jack is not having it. He just responds with ''the girls will figure this out themselves''. So Chris basically just lets it go. They continue working and meeting sometimes to help each other with their cars.

Two weeks go by, I am caught up in work and I don't have time to deal with Dana bill drama. I don't text her. She ''read'' all the messages on Whatsapp at some point, but didn't respond, which is what I kinda knew was gonna happen. Weekend rolls by, Chris and I have a free day and we decide to pay her a visit.

She doesn't work on Saturdays, so we took a chance that she was going to be home. One thing from the time she moved in - I had to give her my set of keys, because one of the keys that Chris ran to make, didn't work, and we decided to get that sorted out later. My apartment door has two keys, one big one and one small. The new big one was fine, but the new small one wouldn't even turn, so I just gave her my small one until she makes me a new one. We all kind of forgot about that since I didn't have to go there anyway.

So we really took a chance by going there, because I couldn't even get in my apartment. And of course, she wasn't home.

Chris had an idea, that we could postpone our visit till Monday when she gets off work. It's a bigger chance she is going to go home from work on Monday. On a Saturday, I wouldn't wait for her all night. She could be anywhere doing anything right now.

And we are right. On Monday we go back, Chris parks somewhere else so she wouldn't see his car and we wait in the stairwell. Her car rolls up right on time, and we put our game faces on.

We hear steps coming up the stairs, and to our suprise, when she turns the corner, she is not alone, there is a guy right behind her. She sees us and is completely taken back, but tries reallllly hard to keep her composure. She says hi, and asks us what we are doing here. Chris says that we were just gonna check on some stuff, take some stuff with us and check on my plants. That we couldn't get a hold of her and just decided to stop by.

She tells us that she is not here for long, that she needs to change outfits and then she and whoever the fuck that was behind her is gonna go. They have some stuff to do.

I'm fine with that. Let's go. We all go the remaining flights of stairs to my apartment, she unlocks it and we all go in. I turn back and I see that Chris shuts the door right in front of that other dude who was completely sure that he is coming in with us. Yeah right.

Dana notices, but says nothing. She knows.

We go inside and look around. Of course the place is a mess, but I kind of already knew that. I see an ashtray on the window sill full with cigarette butts. On the coffee table - two cups, two wine glasses, two bowls. Most of my houseplants are almost dead.

Of course she has had that guy over. Of course she was smoking cigarettes inside. Why the hell not.

Dana starts changing and putting on more makeup. I stay pretty quiet. Just walking around, watering my houseplants, looking at the damage, plotting revenge. Me and Chris talked before, that if all of our hunches about the bad things turn out true, we would not really say anything, but after visiting just set the plans in motion to change the locks. So we do just that. Chris casually mentions that I sent her the bills and Dana says she is going to take a look at them. We talk some more and everything is just overall awkward. More for her than us.

When she is ready, we all are pretty much ready to leave. We all go out, she locks the apartment and that guy is still waiting for her outside the apartment. We say our goodbye's and get in our cars. They drive away. We start plotting.

I end up calling my dad, who kind of knew about the situation. I told him we needed to change the locks to the apartment, he told us what to buy, so we have everything ready, and he would drive up tomorrow to do it.

The next day rolls up. Dana should be at work. Dad is on his way. (He had to drive 2 hours) And everything else is bought and ready. We go to the apartment and dad opens the door with his keys. Everything is still the same and my dad is really taken by surprise. He makes some totally understandable remarks and gets to changing the locks. I start cleaning the place and washing the dishes and Chris helps. Since Dana won't be able to get in the apartment anymore, I wanted it clean. I don't want old food in the fridge, dirty dishes, empty alcohol bottles everywhere and all the other mess. Her stuff - we will worry about it later, nothing important, I don't really live there at the moment.

It doesn't take that long and we are long gone before Dana should be home from work.

At the approximate time she would be at the door not able to open it, Chris and I are at home and sat. Phones in hand. Waiting for Dana to call.

To our surprise Jack is calling Chris. He answers and puts it on speaker. Jack is asking why we changed the locks. That Dana is in complete distress, since she can't get in the apartment and is left with her work purse, whatever is on her person and nothing else. Jack and Chris talk for a while, Chris explains the situation, also mentioning the guy that has apparently been living there with her. (We just found out through mutual friends, that it was the same guy she got drunk with and left that night at the car meet, plus he has been staying there for a while). Chris pretty much tells him everything and Jack is just not having it. In his eyes Dana could do no such thing and they apparently have been going out almost every evening and could be considered a couple now (his words).

Chris and Jack finish up talking. Jack tells him that he is going to take Dana to his place for now, but that we should really figure this shit out because he is not taking her to move in with him.

I could give zero fucks.

Later that night Dana messages me and sends me a reeeeally long paragraph. Basically saying that she never agreed to pay anything and that I am the a-hole for bringing up any bills and utilities out of the blue. She doesn't remember any conversations about her paying anything. That is why she never answered, because she didn't know what to say and I was just asking for money now for no reason. And now I just change locks without a reason and she can't get home. She didn't do anything wrong and wants at least some of her stuff for now and talk about getting the rest.

I was REALLY mad. Now I have to deal with gaslighting?

But I knew what to do. I remembered a time where we (me, Chris, Dana, Jack) were at mcdonalds with a bunch of other friends. A good portion of the friend group all started talking about the fact that Dana recently moved in my place. Everyone was really happy that something worked out for Dana and we all talked how it will be really easy for her to get on her feet by just paying the utilities at my place. We even discussed how my utilities were cheaper than everyone elses, since my apartment is not at the center of the city and is pretty small.

Remembering this gave me an idea. I wasn't done with her. I didn't care that I now had everything she owns at my place and she can't get to it. I didn't care that she doesn't even have a change of clothes or her charger. I was more mad that she is now trying to gaslight me into believing that I never said she had to pay anything.

So I made a groupchat. Everybody who was at that table at mcdonalds that night and a couple more of our mutual friends just for the fun, some bf's and gf's and such. And of course Dana, Jack and Chris. I think it was around 12-14 people in total. I sent a pretty long message, basically explaining the situation and asking about our conversation that night. Did I really say that Dana could live there for free?

The groupchat blew up! No one could believe what Dana did and she was getting dragged. Everyone remembered our conversation and some friends even remembered Dana saying that she could maybe pay me something in rent when she gets back on her feet. Not only utility bills. I end up sending some screenshots from mine and Dana's chat, some other receipts and everyone is dragging Dana even more and more. Dana had already told some of those people that I locked her out, but didn't really say why. Also this groupchat reveals that she owes a lot of money to some of these friends. She asked them to help out because I was asking her to pay ungodly amounts for rent each month.

Dana of course leaves the chat. Jack stays and reads everything, not contributing. Just reading. Amongst those friends is also the girl (28) that got Dana her new job. Let's call her Tina. We were not very close, but sometimes saw each other, since our boyfriends are car guys. She is the most shocked and messages me privately. She writes all the things Dana has been saying behind my back to whoever will listen.

Those things you can most likely guess. About the huge rent that I am asking from nowhere, that I won't leave her alone about the money, how we are trying to break her and Jack apart, all that.

Me and Tina end up meeting and she says she can actually get Dana fired if I wanted to. I say no. That would be a little too petty for me to do. As much as I hate her now, I was actually thinking of giving her all of her stuff back, because what would I do with it anyways. And I don't think I have the guts to leave a fellow girl with absolutely nothing. I actually was kinda sad for her. She doesn't have anywhere to go and absolutely no stuff on her name.

A couple days pass. Chris and Jack meet at work and Jack says that on the ''groupchat night'' she just drove away and blocked him. His eyes opened when he read everything and it's a good thing he didn't even have a chance to see her after reading all that, because he would've lost it. The three of us meet and we talk through everything.

Now some of his side of the story.

Since the whole beginning Dana never said anything about Tom. Of course, how could she. She behaved, talked and acted like single. She had Jack wrapped pretty tight around her finger. She never told him where she lived exactly (pick ups and drop offs were from the gas station near Tom's place) and managed to keep Tom, a relationship and living with a man a secret until the move.

*We later found out that she told Tom that she was just out with friends. Tom broke up with her because someone (most likely Tom's friend who knew that they were together) had seen Dana and Jack together kissing and told him. And he already suspected cheating, so that was all he needed.*

She pretty much gaslighted Jack moving forward. When Jack asked about Tom, just after they broke up and she moved to my place, she reminded him that she explicitly never said that she was single. That she was in love with Jack and she wanted to break up with Tom at that time anyways, just to be with Jack. She manipulated him into not talking about it with anyone at all. That is why he didn't want to hear anything about those bills at the time. Dana just dug up some lies if the situation changed anywhere and managed to keep the coast clear.

When she moved in to my place, they continued to meet about 3-4 times a week on evenings. Just driving around and falling in love. But apparently Dana wasn't as much falling in love if we remember the random guy car meet incident. And Jack of course knew nothing at all. He was under the impression that they are slowly becoming a couple. And all that until the ''groupchat night'' when all went to shit. He apologised for being a bad and completely blind friend. It's okay buddy. Women can be bitches.

Now back to Dana and how she didn't get her shit back.

To recap, some time has passed since the ''groupchat night''. None of her friends are speaking to her, some just sent her passive aggressive texts and asked for their money back. She doesn't respond. We don't hear from her for two months.

Chris through some work colleagues hears where Dana is living. It turns out that she contacted one of her ex-colleagues at Chris's work, that was a pretty good friend of hers and begged for a place to stay. He (M,mid 30's) and his wife (F27) have a house in the city and the second floor is pretty much empty. So she is now living there. Let's call this couple Rachel and Ross, just for fun.

Chris tells Ross that if Dana wants her stuff back, she has to come to our place, apologise and tell us what the hell is going on with her. Cause that is what I wanted to receive if I was to give her that stuff back. An apology and explanation. Because I could understand ANYTHING if you are truly sorry and understand what you did. And try to fix the whole thing. I still understand that Dana has not had an easy life and that can really cause a person to do weird and awful stuff. Especially if she is in survival mode with depression and anxiety and is just trying to find her way.

Ross also spends some time with Chris talking about the whole apartment situation and is really surprised to hear some of that stuff. He says Dana told them something, but not that. And he wants to talk a little to his wife before they make any decisions.

He takes that conversation home and couple of days later we are invited to their house. We didn't know what was happening, so we just went there blindly. We didn't know if Dana was going to be there or not.

She wasn't. Turns out after Ross came home and started to ask questions, Dana took whatever new stuff she got herself, jumped in her car and left. She didn't have much stuff so moving out from there was pretty easy. Ross and Rachel wanted to know more about this situation so they invited us.

They made us a nice dinner and we talked everything out. We told them the whole story and they were shocked. Dana had told them that we broke up her and her boyfriend and because of us she doesn't have a place to stay. And the same story about the apartment and that I changed the locks out of nowhere. I wanted her to pay some crazy amount for rent every month and when she couldn't, I just changed the locks, and now she has no stuff. They felt really bad for her and invited her to live in their house on the second floor. It's empty anyways with some basic furniture.

Turns out that she did stupid things with them too.

She would eat all of their food, not buying any. Rachel made dinner for everyone, Dana would eat more than a half of it. (yes, she was a stress eater) Ross's snacks were gone. She would sometimes snarky comment that he buys the things that she doesn't like.

Since she had no stuff, she used a lot of Rachel's stuff. Toiletries, hairdryer, hair straightener, clothes, socks, shoes, nail polishes, towels, makeup, chargers, all that. One time she even left the hair straightener plugged in for a whole night and burned the wooden floor underneath it. Good thing the whole house didn't catch on fire.

Ross and Rachel started to see that Dana could be a problem and started talking with her. About the food, about coming home late at night and the loud music from the car when someone drops her off back at the house, about the friggin straightener thing!, she had drank everything from their bar, and a lot of other small problems they were having.

Dana didn't listen and continued. And the conversation that Ross and Chris had the first time - well that put everything together for Ross and he went home to confront her. And she just left.

After that talk with Ross and Rachel I realised, she doesn't deserve her stuff back. I gave her an option. She could've just apologised to me and she could have her stuff back. But no. Later that week, me and some friends from the groupchat went to my place to pack it up and donate most of it. I kept nothing.

And do you want to know how she lost her job?

Her and Tina got in an argument at work and she slashed Tina's tires. There was security camera footage and the boss fired her immediately.

Later we found out that after that she was living in a small shared apartment with 2 Indian guys. Sometimes I think that the whole thing actually was crazy for her and she was truly left with nothing and is living a crazy crazy life now. But at the same time.... I really did nothing wrong and I am kinda glad karma got to her.

Thank you if you reached the end of this story. It was a lot to write and my fingers are cramping like crazyyyyyy. When I told you I like to tell a story in all detail, it is truly what I meant. If you have any questions aks them in the comments, I will try my best to reply.

Essential Skills for Success in Online Chat Support Roles
---------------------------------------------------------

The job of an online chat support representative is both rewarding and challenging. It requires a specific set of skills that ensure success in the fast-paced digital marketplace. If you're considering a career in this field or want to improve your skills, understanding what it takes to excel can set you apart from the competition.

First and foremost, excellent communication skills are essential. Chat representatives interact with customers on a daily basis, making it crucial to convey messages clearly and effectively. You must be able to type quickly and accurately while keeping a friendly tone. The ability to ask the right questions and understand the customer's needs can turn a frustrating experience into a positive interaction.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
In addition to communication, strong problem-solving skills are vital. Every customer interaction will present unique challenges, and you'll need to think on your feet. Understanding how to analyze the situation and provide solutions in real-time is essential. This might mean de-escalating a situation, guiding a customer through troubleshooting steps, or providing detailed product information.

Empathy also plays a significant role in success. Customers often reach out because they're frustrated, confused, or in need of assistance. Showing understanding and patience can make all the difference. When customers feel heard and valued, they are more likely to leave a positive review and return for future business.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
Here are some essential skills that you should cultivate to thrive as an online chat support representative:

- **Typing Accuracy and Speed:** Being able to type efficiently allows you to handle multiple inquiries without sacrificing quality.
- **Attention to Detail:** It's important to listen carefully and remember information about customers to provide personalized support.
- **Technical Savviness:** Familiarity with various software and chat tools can enhance your communication and make your job easier.
- **Time Management:** Balancing multiple chats at once while providing quality service requires strong organizational skills.
- **Adaptability:** Each conversation may be different, and being able to adjust your style is crucial for meeting customer needs.

Another significant skill is an understanding of the company’s products and services. You need to be knowledgeable about what you're supporting. This requires ongoing learning and staying up-to-date with any changes or new developments. A strong foundation in the company’s offerings allows you to provide accurate information to customers efficiently.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
Having a positive attitude is also important. Working in chat support can often be stressful, and remaining upbeat helps not only you but also the customers. A cheerful disposition can transform the interaction and encourage customers to remain engaged, leading to higher satisfaction rates.

Working on your multitasking skills is beneficial as well. You may find yourself juggling several customer chats at once, so being able to switch between tasks without losing focus is crucial. You might also need to look up information while communicating with a customer, so being organized and efficient can save valuable time.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
Being an active listener is another critical skill. When customers feel that you're genuinely listening to their concerns, they will feel valued. Repeating back what they have said or summarizing their issues can show the customer that you are engaged, making the conversation more effective.

Moreover, managing stress is key in high-pressure situations. Sometimes, customers may be frustrated or upset. Being able to stay calm, even when faced with difficult interactions, is crucial for success in this role. Techniques for stress management, such as deep breathing or taking short breaks, can help maintain composure.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
Always look for feedback. Constructive criticism can help you identify areas of improvement. Many companies will offer evaluations and performance reviews, so use these opportunities to learn and grow.

Becoming a successful online chat support representative requires a blend of communication, empathy, and problem-solving skills. By developing these abilities and continuously striving for improvement, you can not only excel in your role but also enhance the overall customer experience. This career path offers a unique blend of challenges and rewards for those ready to rise to the occasion.

### Conclusion

Working as an online chat support representative offers numerous advantages that go beyond the traditional office job. The flexibility of remote work allows you to balance your personal and professional life more effectively. Whether you’re a parent needing to juggle childcare or someone who thrives in a comfortable home office, the benefits are clear. The ability to work from anywhere not only saves time and money on commuting but also opens up opportunities to join companies around the globe, diversifying your career experience.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
To excel in this role, mastering key skills is essential. Exceptional communication skills stand at the forefront; being clear and concise while remaining friendly can transform a mundane interaction into a positive customer experience. Proficiency in digital tools and an understanding of customer relationship management software are also vital. Additionally, patience and empathy play crucial roles in handling inquiries or complaints. You’re not just a voice behind a screen, but a problem-solver and a source of reassurance for customers.

I just did my first baneful magic ritual and I used toilet paper, wrote the persons name folded it three times away from me after wiping my a** with it gave my intentions and put it in the bowl.

I’m pretty sure people are going to come for me for doing white magic (hoo doo, church ect. and black magic, baneful magic, Hecate) but I believe in the duality of magic and spirituality and not that these things are mutually exclusive.

1jufh37,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JawsTec/comments/1jufh37/a_new_era_of_household_innovations/,A New Era of Household Innovations,"In recent years, 3D printing has emerged as one of the most exciting technological advancements, offering the promise of transforming how we create and customize everyday objects. While it may have started as a tool for prototyping and industrial design, 3D printing is now finding its way into homes, helping people solve problems, save money, and personalize their living spaces.

So, how exactly can 3D printing help with household items? Let’s explore some of the ways this technology is becoming a game-changer for the modern home.

# 1. Replacement Parts for Broken Items

One of the most practical uses of 3D printing in the home is to replace broken or missing parts from household items. Whether it’s a snapped-off piece from your blender, a lost part from a vacuum cleaner, or a broken door handle, 3D printing offers a quick and affordable solution. Rather than ordering expensive parts or waiting weeks for a replacement, you can simply print the missing component yourself, often at a fraction of the cost.

If you don’t have a file, we can recommend you to CAD more where they can help you get a file started and created, then you would just put your file in our instant 3D printing quote and we can start printing your part(s).

# 2. Custom Kitchen Gadgets

If you love cooking, 3D printing can help you create personalized kitchen tools designed to make your cooking experience smoother. From custom cookie cutters with your kids’ favorite shapes to specialized measuring spoons or an innovative bottle opener, 3D printing allows you to create kitchen gadgets that suit your specific needs and tastes.

Plus, you can experiment with unique materials that are food-safe and durable, giving you the flexibility to create items that might not be available on the market. If you have a specific design in mind, you can bring it to life with just a few clicks.

# 3. Personalized Home Decor

Who doesn’t love a bit of personal flair in their home decor? 3D printing can help you design and produce custom pieces that reflect your personality. Whether it’s a unique vase, a custom-made lamp, or a set of coasters featuring your favorite patterns, 3D printing allows you to express yourself without the limitations of mass-produced items.

You can also experiment with unusual materials and textures, adding a modern touch to your home while making sure the design is one-of-a-kind. Why settle for generic decor when you can create something that’s entirely yours?

# 4. Organizational Solutions

Clutter is a common challenge in many households, but with 3D printing, you can design custom organizers to solve your storage problems. From drawer dividers and cable management solutions to unique shelving units, the possibilities are endless.

Need a specific-sized container for your spices or a personalized holder for your favorite tools? With 3D printing, you can create perfectly-sized storage solutions that fit your space and style. Plus, it’s a fun way to exercise your creativity while solving everyday organizational challenges.

# 5. Toys and Games for Kids

If you have young children, 3D printing can be a great way to create custom toys and games. From educational puzzles to action figures or building blocks, 3D printing allows you to design toys that are safe, fun, and tailored to your child’s interests. You can even involve your kids in the design process, teaching them about technology and creativity.

Since 3D printers can create highly detailed models, the possibilities for custom toys are practically limitless. You can also print out replacement parts for board games or create your own personalized game pieces for extra fun!

# 6. Home Improvement and DIY Projects

3D printing is an excellent tool for DIY enthusiasts looking to tackle home improvement projects. From custom brackets and hangers to decorative elements like molding or trim, 3D printing can produce precise, durable components that fit your specifications. If you’ve got an older house with hard-to-find parts or you want to customize an existing item, 3D printing lets you create exactly what you need.

In addition, for hobbyists working on small furniture or decor projects, 3D printing offers a cost-effective alternative to purchasing pre-made parts. You can design and print everything you need, from legs for a coffee table to decorative panels for a bookshelf.

# 7. Eco-Friendly Solutions

In an age where sustainability is key, 3D printing offers an eco-friendly alternative to mass production and the waste it generates. With a 3D printer, you can create products using recycled materials, reducing the need for new plastic production. Many 3D printers also allow you to reuse failed prints or scraps to create new objects, contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle.

Additionally, by printing only what you need, you minimize waste and avoid the overproduction common with traditional manufacturing. This approach not only helps the environment but also aligns with the growing trend of responsible consumption.

# 8. Repurposing Old Items

Another great benefit of 3D printing is the ability to repurpose old household items that might otherwise end up in the trash. With a 3D printer, you can fix or modify old items, breathing new life into them. For example, you can print replacement feet for old chairs, create custom parts for an outdated appliance, or even design new handles or covers for items that have lost their functionality.

This is a sustainable way to extend the life of your belongings and reduce your environmental footprint.

# 9. Accessibility and Adaptation

For people with disabilities or specific needs, 3D printing can provide customized solutions that make everyday life more accessible. From custom grips on household tools to adaptive devices that make it easier to operate certain items, 3D printing allows for high levels of customization that can significantly improve quality of life. This technology is especially helpful when off-the-shelf solutions are not available or affordable.

# Conclusion:

3D printing has the potential to transform how we approach household items, offering a way to create custom, functional, and eco-friendly solutions right at home. Whether you’re replacing broken parts, designing personalized décor, or experimenting with innovative organizational solutions, this technology opens up endless possibilities for creativity and problem-solving.

As 3D printing becomes more accessible and affordable, it’s clear that this technology will continue to play a pivotal role in everyday life, making home maintenance, organization, and personalization easier and more fun than ever before. So why not get started? Your next household project might just be a 3D print away!",1,1744123951.0,u_JawsTec,0,1.0,False

I've bought other brands.  My current 12 cup Cuisinart is already on the way out because the plastic knob is coming lose.

Seriously how do you guys limit carb? Especially those who come from a carb dominated food culture? 

I am not even doing keto. I try to keep my carbohydrates below 150g per day and that is becoming super difficult for me that most days I am over 20g. I stopped eating white rice, bread (mostly, but even if I eat I never take more than one slice) , any kind of pasta/spaghetti, and offcourse dessert. I can't eat chicken breast three times per day! I don't even like chicken breast to be honest. 

For breakfast its usually one whole wheat bread with half tea spoon of honey (or one slice sugar free banana bread) with coffee. For lunch or dinner its usually lots of mixed cucumber, tomato, carrot, apple salad with chickpea or breaded chicken strip ( I admit breaded chicken strip has carb) or vegetables and chicken / fish curry. 

As I have horrible sweet tooth, I need something sweet after meal so I have one clementine or one pear/apple after meal. 

Still... I always exceed my carb limit by the end of the day. I snack sometimes like chips or wafer but thats may be 6g chips or one/two mini wafers. 

I am trying my best to increase protein intake which is itself very difficult but Please suggest me how to reduce carb more.

It looks to be almost the size of my actual tooth - pretty big. It's my only filling and I haven't had any other issues with my teeth.

Today during lunch, I bit into a caramel tart, and after feeling it with my tongue it seems about 30% of it has “lifted” away from my tooth or gum, while the remaining 70% is still firmly in place.

I’m not experiencing any pain yet. I finished my coffee without discomfort, though I haven’t tried eating anything else or drinking anything cold yet.

The problem is that I recently moved to a town in France with the next available dental appointment being June. After spending two hours calling every dentist in the area, I’ve learned that emergency treatment is nearly impossible to get unless you’re in severe pain, which currently rules me out.

I also have a fear of dentists and tooth pain due to a traumatic experience with teeth removal as a child. So right now I’m in full-on panic mode.

I’m wondering what to expect. Is it likely to fall out completely the next time I eat? Or could it stay intact until my appointment in June? Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.",1,1744123529.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Sneha comes home from her work, she sees someone sitting in the couch in the hall
Sneha: hey yaaru nee , ani yaaru idhu

Jeevan slowly turns and says amma, Sneha was shocked and fell on her knees and slowly holds the face of Jeevan who hugs her,

jeevans sister and sees her brother and asks eppadi

Gandhi comes from behind and says marupiravi.

they all hug together as Jeevan says sorry ma

they all go to a kovil thiruvizha and both Gandhi and Jeevan dances for a rural koothu song

 as the song ends ,Jayaram calls Gandhi to visit office

Gandhi agreed and went to office

Jayaram and others sit in the meeting room as Gandhi enters

as he was saying this the current went off then red buzzer light started blaring then Gandhi comes out to see several masked men attacking the agents he goes and fights them and other agents join.

as Gandhi is busy fighting, he hears a voice calling appa he turns to see Jeevan coming to see him and trying to say something. he is shot in his back and head and falls on the arm of Gandhi, he says, ammava kaapathunga pa

Gandhi looks up to see who shooted Jeevan and sees bharath who later tries to shoot Gandhi but Gandhi looks him instead, and tears a mask of one of the men and sees Bharath who kills Jayaram by shoving a knife in his throat,

Jayaram: do not let this bastards ruin our nation Gandhi, you are my only hope

Gandhi leaves the place in a bike to go to his house to see Sneha and her daughter,

but 2 people follows him in their bike and bike chase similar one to the Russian one plays, at the end he reaches his home

to see anikha and Sneha being tied to a chair by similarly masked people, as Gandhi tries to save them he is hit in his head and menon appears

he says venna nyavaga iruka, nee enakku senjathotha pala madangu unnaku naa seiyen wait and watch and he hits is again and Gandhi faints.

My husband turns 30 this year and I am stumped as to what to get him. Since it’s a big birthday, I want to make sure it’s a good one, however I am not the best gift giver. I was hoping to plan a trip, however I do not believe that is going to work out this year. Nonetheless, he loves golf, video games (especially fortnite, pubg, call of duty, and madden), coffee, grilling, football/hockey/baseball, etc. I love the idea of making a big basket for him, however I am open to whatever! Looking to spend around $200. 

Any ideas are much appreciated! Thank you in advance 😊

Are you looking for a math nerd with an rbf but soft inside?

I am a recent applied Mathematics graduate in Texas. Currently in search of something for my field while I work at a coffee shop. 

About me:

I am a very straight forward person who enjoys things being clear. Improving at things and doing things efficiently is something I really enjoy doing. I have a somewhat dry/sarcastic/witty sense of humor and can enjoy dark humor. For those interested, I am an INTJ.

I am a nerd (as shown by my major). My hobbies include building, painting, and playing Warhammer 40k. I also enjoy gaming (mainly PC). My favorite game series is monster hunter. Recently I have been playing marvel rivals, Minecraft and monster hunter wilds.

My favorite music is 2000s/alt rock like breaking benjamin, sleep token, and three days grace.

I enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi books. I recently got done with the abolethic sovereignty novels and really loved it.

I am not religious and I am left leaning.
 
I work out semi regularly at home. Mostly calisthenics: pull ups, push ups, sit ups, ...

Some things I am looking for:
You are between 22-26 and are in the US. Preferably close to Texas.
Someone interested in getting to know each other first.

1juf4e1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1juf4e1,March Budolz,"👋 Hellooo. Just sharing my honest thoughts sa makeup budols ko last month plus this recent 4.4 sale.

Detail Cosmetics:
— honestly got tempted sa new glass stain coffee shades nila and it's worth it !! (as always, shade may vary depending on your lip's undertone) 
— True Naked is vv good to me as a morena cool tone. Di ko inexpect na mas pipiliin ko pa siya for casual everyday use than their shade 'Dip' (10/10)
— Cold Brew is more pale than TN but complements with the lip tone after some time. Still fit for morenas, and can be used for everyday din. I just like TN more kasi that shade shows up on me. (9/10)

Squad Cosmetics:
— since 11.11 pa lang very tempting na to check out their cream blushes pero this March lang me nagpabudol kasi grabe ang sale price (total of ₱137)
— I'd say they're a good blush but not the best na it will last you the whole day. But hey, considering the price, it's all goods naman. 
— Happy pot shade: Prom Queen (9/10) mas creamier and much more pigmented so better be careful when applying sa cheeks mo. I had no problem blending them out, nagulat lang talaga ako kasi it shows up really bright red to me. 
— Soft Serve shade: Butternut (9/10) eto medyo mas hirap maka pickup ng cream both brush and your fingers. Andd, medyo hirap din mag apply ng pigment sa cheeks. Pero the shade is good naman, I like it very much.

Shiseido Baby powder (11/10) — pinabili ko lang 'to sa pinsan ko from Japan and grabeee sobrang okay niya sa oily skin ko. No cakey buildups, has nice oil-control, plus it doesn't really show up very maputi sa skin ko. Vv good for retouch din! Thank you talaga at naalala ko magpasabuy nung pauwi na pinsan ko. 

Dazzle Me: (10/10)
— let's just say I got very budol talaga heree HAHAHAHA bought total estimate of ₱110 each bottle sa new setting spray nila + free makeup mist.
— It's the pink-yellow one, their collab with SmileyWorld. I superrr loved the nozzle kasi ganun talaga hinahanap ko na spray, very fine mist lang ang atake. Sa wear test ko after receiving my first bottle, ay wow grabe! As a very oily person, hindi talaga ako nag blot ng mukha for 5 hours makeup, AND nakatambay pa ako sa kusina 'non, nakapatay electric fan, SOBRANGGG WOW talaga ako sa hold ng setting spray sa makeup ko 🥹. 
— ayun 3 days after, i bought 2 more HAHAHA and I gave one to my cousin para super slayy. 
— first time ko ata gagamit ng setting spray for f2f, and everytime gagala. thankyew saur muuuch dazzle me for this nozzle omgee.

Sassy colors (8/10):
— their brow gel ay very matagal na sa cart ko and this 4.4 sale ko lang nabili, and sadly I regret it slight :((
— I tried 2 times na talaga, walang product, just my bare skin, setting spray agad after, pero ayaw talaga mag hold? 🥹 Eh ayun pa naman lagi kong nababasa na good reviews huhu.
— Kanina lang, napansin ko na nagka pimple ako above my right eyebrow 😭 that's my first time experiencing it huhu. Napansin ko lang na medyo masakit when I touched in that area kanina. 
— 5 days pa lang of using it, pero ayaw talaga mag work no matter the amount I put 🤧 maybe I should've bought EB na lang that has a cheaper sale nung 4.4. I'll still use this brow gel though kasi may event kami next week haaays. ",1,1744123050.0,beautytalkph,1,1.0,False

I struggled with it for 10 years and I’ve done irreparable damage to my body (I can no longer drink alcohol, coffee, eat spicy foods, citrus, etc. unless I want to risk bleeding ulcers and this is just one example.) 

With the way her fans are defending her extreme weight loss, saying she hasn’t changed and repeating the same rhetoric of “my body is healthy, healthy looks different for everybody” is only going to fuel her ED. On top of that the whole “oh she’s so baby! Awwweeee she’s so tiny!” Is encouraging to hear for someone with an ED, it will make them feel like all their “hard work” is paying off. 

She’s probably only got 10 years left MAX if she keeps up with her food restrictions and her fans are only making that amount of time shorten by ignoring the obvious red flags. 

It’s tragic because while I’m not a fan of her personality, she is an incredible vocalist (though you can tell her ED has effected her vocal capabilities as well especially on this last album she dropped.) Nobody deserves an early grave and I fear we are watching a Karen Carpenter situation happen all over again. 

I truly don’t believe she will make it to 40 and it’s sad to see someone struggling refusing to get help, despite her shitty behavior, I can’t help but feel of bad for her because I can see where her ED is going to lead at this rate. ",26,1744122484.0,ArianaGrandeSnark,11,0.88,False
1juevsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1juevsc/healed_from_acute_erosive_gastritis/,Healed From Acute Erosive Gastritis,"Tl;dr I healed from gastritis, eat everything now, and weaned off all medication. 

July 23, 2023, I experienced an acute gastritis incident after drinking too much. One month later, I was diagnosed with acute erosive gastritis with developing ulceration. Negative h. Pylori and everything else they biopsied for. It was determined that excess ibuprofen use, along with stress, diet, and lifestyle led to the incident. I was so happy that it was ""acute"" because I thought that meant I'd be healed in time for my wedding that October. Lol. I was not.

The first month was hell - my symptoms progressed from a globus feeling in my throat for a few days, to a sudden onset of horrible acid reflux, which would begin in the afternoon and continuing throughout the night. I did not sleep for several weeks. I was ""a mess"". At about the 6 week mark, after my endoscopy, the 80 mg of pantropozole my doctor put me on finally allowed my stomach to heal enough so that the acid reflux stopped. I was overjoyed. At that time, I also began a course of sucralfate 4x a day, which I remained on for 8 weeks. 

In the beginning of this, I had put myself on a vegan diet because I had no idea what I was doing and was just trying to eat something. After my endoscopy, my brilliant gastroenterologist encouraged me to eat animal protein and engage in exercise, as both have shown to help with the healing of ulceration. So, I reintroduced things like turkey and egg whites, which helped me put back on the 15lbs I had lost over the previous month. I also started to exercise again (walks, cycling). 

From August until mid-October, things went pretty smoothly. I had cut all irritating foods from my diet, had sworn off alcohol, coffee, chocolate - all the usual suspects, and was feeling pretty good. The week after my wedding in mid-October, however, I had my first flare-up which was not severe, but it was definitely a flare-up. I thought it was probably because I had indulged in some wedding cake and other foods not on my safe list over the wedding/honeymoon. The flare-up was very depressing as I'd been thinking I was healed. It lasted for a month. My doctor decided at that point to switch me from 80 mg Pantropozole to 60 mg Dexilant in December, and also to put me on 10 mg lexapro. It took one month for my body to adjust to the Dexilant and lexapro, so during that time I experienced some minor reflux symptoms and some lexapro side effects related to sexual dysfunction. However, Dexilant is the shit once it kicked in and lexapro was a life saver (sexual dysfunction resolved).

In January 2024, I started the gastritis healing diet and started taking an expensive probiotic, Creatine, l-glutamine, etc. I committed to the GHD for 90 days. The mods I made were that I only ate organic foods and obviously I didn't touch anything processed. My new husband and I became obsessed with ingredients, which is something that we've permanently adopted. We eat organic as much as possible, and have a zero tolerance approach to additives in the food we buy. The exception being when we're out to eat and vacation. One must live.

Anyway, I digress. From January 2024 through March 2024, I was on the GHD and my overall symptoms just gradually improved. After March, I began reintroducing foods slowly. By August 2024, I was drinking a low acid coffee again, everyday. By September 2024, I had my first glass of wine, and by October 2024, I began weaning Dexilant and I traveled to Italy for 2 weeks (ate and drank everything). The final day of Italy, after over indulging on chocolate, I started to experience nausea on an empty stomach, so for the following 2 weeks I paused my Dexilant taper and introduced sucralfate for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, I continued my Dexilant taper, nausea completely removed.

As of April 2025, I've completely weaned off Dexilant and I'm nearly weaned off Lexapro. I eat a mostly keto, organic, low to no processed food diet, workout 5-6 days per week, drink occasionally, have coffee everyday, eat out no problem. Let me know if you have questions. 

P.S. I went through nearly all the things I see people post about in this space: I thought the PPI was making things worse for a while, I was worried I'd ""ruined"" my progress by eating too late or a bit too much, I worried I had some underlying, undiagnosed issue that caused gastritis, I worried I'd never eat normally again. I worried I would get SIBO, I worried I HAD SIBO, etc. But I just stuck to the program, tried to talk myself off the ledge, focused on what I could control, etc.",24,1744122436.0,Gastritis,11,1.0,False

1jueuz7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jueuz7,Reviving my 15 yo first gen Kinesis Advantage,"15 years ago I got my first truly ergo keyboard. I did a lot of research and decided that I wanted a Datahand II. Problem here was that even the used ones came in at around 2k at the time. Impossible. 

So I got the back then closest thing, this Kinesis Advantage with MX Brown switches. And I loved it to death and learned Dvorak on it which I still use to this day and do my 140-ish wpm with it. 

It basically saved my career because of bad hand and finger issues from bad keyboards. 

I used it for 11 years and then the bad thing happened. I spilled some coffee inside and the main board shorted out and also a trace on on thumb cluster (see circuit bending). So it was broken and useless. 

Not long after that I did the Stapelberg mod and it was good as new ... I thought. Because shortly after one of the flex boards had a defect and I was left with an unusable keyboard again. 

I started checking out other options. So I soldered myself a Lumberjack. But it wasn't ergo enough. So I build a Corne complete with RGB, wireless and Battery. At some point I discovered the Svalboard and oh my god I had to have it. And it's so awesome that after a short while I was fluid as ever on it.

A couple of months ago the Kinesis basically fell on my head when cleaning out a cabinet. Damn it I had to repair it. So here it is. So I ripped the flex board out, did some handwiring to make it work with the Stapelberg mod (which is basically a drop in replacement for the og board).

Switches that I have used are the `Akko V3 Creme Blue Pro`and today I got the blank Adv360 keycaps because the blank KA switches are not available in my country.

I must say I am so happy that I have restored it. Within a week it became my favorite keyboard again. It is just timeless and classic and the most comfy keyboard that I have ever used. 

Regarding the Adv360 switches: I have read some reviews of people that are not that happy with them a the KA because of some switches feeling different. I at least do not feel the same. imho the switches fit perfectly with nothing left to be desired and together with the Akko switches they are really thocky. 

Some might notice that the thumb clusters still have the MX brown switches. Except for one switch that was broken I will leave them in for now. They still work and feel great and even they have a nice thock with the new caps. And the wiring picture is just before I covered everything in a huge amount of hot glue to not rip out everything when I need to pull off a cap.",21,1744122379.0,ErgoMechKeyboards,2,1.0,False

Nameet ko siya sa Tinder. We've been chatting for 2 weeks actually. Until we decided na mag meetup na and sagot daw niya yung coffee. I told him naman na sagot ko na yung dinner just to be fair lang din. So sa coffee shop sa isang mall sa Ortigas and yun na nga and nag meet na kami. Like OMG he's tall, moreno and medyo muscular. Super neat tignan. Hindi ko kinaya i swear to God.

Kwentuhan lang kami. Then may dala siyang tote bag then nilabas niya laptop and tablet niya then biglang may tumawag sa phone niya then siguro may 7x na siyang nag aaccept ng calls then lumalayo saglit. Pag balik niya i asked if this is not a good time to meet kase busy ata siya sa work niya and all pero he told me na samahan ko raw siya sa work niya saglit may naiwan daw kase siyang mga docs and all so i said yes naman. So we went to this place in Pasay and then ang daming tao sa paligid. I told him na hindi na ako bababa ng car and will be waiting for him nalang pero sumama nalang daw ako since saglit lang naman kami. Nahihiya ako kase naka shorts lang ako and to think na office yun so ayoko sana pero pinilit parin niya ako. Until i heard someone screamed ""good morning!"" (Kahit late afternoon na yun) And medyo kinutuban na ako and hoping na sana mali lang ako ng iniisip. Then he guided me sa isang meeting room. After 20 minutes or more from waiting, may pumasok then was asking if friend ba raw ako ni yun na nga. I said yes then she asked if i need anything like drinks and all but i declined and asked where's the cr so I can relieve myself since ihing ihi na ako and nahihiya talaga ako. Tinuro naman niya sakin where then i entered. Pag labas ko, nandun parin si ate then sinamahan pa niya ako bumalik sa room na yun then she joined me na. Manager nga raw siya ni kachat and would like to tell me about an opportunity na to earn extra income and to listen lang sa orientation na yun. I simply said no and will wait for kachat nalang to arrive. Medyo pushy si ate so sige for the sake na maiwasan ko lang siya. 

So dun na nga sa may sumigaw ng good morning and yun na nga! Networking amp! Then pinaupo na nga ako then may mga onting activity sila and they encourage everyone to participate. I was trying to look for kachat dun sa room na yun pero wala siya. More than 30 minutes na and hindi parin tapos and life story ni kuya sa stage and then dumating si kachat then he asked me to follow him na nga. Bumalik uli kami sa meeting room kung saan niya ako iniwan then nandun si ate niyo and may isang guy na and then todo shake hands pa nga sila. I stared kay kachat na ""what the hell is this?"" Then nag start na sila sa spiel nila. Then even showed to me a check na may 850k and pwede raw akong kumita ng ganon. I stood up and told them na I'm not interested and ayoko talaga ng sales, networking or whatever they call it pa. I stated na hindi ako comfortable sa ganong setup and showing me these checks and meeting other people aside from them and told them to give it to someone who's interested with this kind of work. I told them that I'm leaving na then si kachat naman was asking for me to stay kase may padinner daw sila. I just want to go home nalang. He was telling me something na pero I'm not listening to him.

The house is 7 years old and has a ton of AFCI breakers, we just recently moved in. While I am by no means an electrician, I have enough knowledge to do basic diagnostics and install of new receptacles and circuits, but am not very knowledgeable on these AFCI breakers. 

We have 2 specifically that have been tripping, the kitchen outlets and the living room. The kitchen one will randomly trip when the coffee pot is running (with nothing else running), but not always. The living room circuit tripping is fairly new, and tripped when my wife was on her computer (laptop with a few external monitors) and I was playing PS5. Breakers reset fine. Doing the test on them, it trips after 2 seconds indicating an arc fault. Outlets were installed properly, not with the backstab method. 

Where should I start looking for the cause of these trips? I have seen a lot of people generally dislike AFCI Breakers, and I'm not opposed to swapping them out for normal breakers, but i want to make sure it's actually just am overly sensitive arc fault breaker and not an actual issue.

Consistent Tummy time. Elimination communication potty training. Reading to them everyday. Using reusable diapers. Consistent pumping/breastfeeding schedule to rapidly increase supply before I had to go back to work. 

All those birds have been shot out the window and I feel like I struggle to just do anything. 

He is almost a month old, and I feel totally wore out from just feeding and changing him every couple hours. When he is awake I try to do some tummy time and use flashcards, read a little, but honestly I'm just hoping he will go back to sleep as soon as possible so I can catch up on laundry, eat something, poop, or just take a nap. 

I feel guilty for being so frustrated when he wakes up or won't go right back to sleep after morning feed so I can make coffee, feel human etc. 

My partner has two jobs now so I don't get a lot of help. He has maybe one full day off a week, and he will help out enough to where I can get an uninterrupted shower but it's still so hard. 

I had to start supplementing with formula early on because my milk didn't come in and he lost to much weight,, and now I'm starting to use it as a crutch and worried it's impacting my milk supply. 

Like, I can't handle being glued to the couch for an hour and half with cluster feeding in the middle of the night, so I just give him a formula bottle some of the night feeds in order to us go back to bed quicker. I tell myself I'm gonna make it up with extra pumps but I rarely do. 

I didn't realize how hard this phase was, and how much I was going to struggle to maintain my ""ideal' based on my pre-birth plans. 

I know he is fed and healthy and doctor says I'm doing a good job at his wellness check ups but it just doesn't feel like it. 

Mom guilt, hormones, and sleep deprivation are a bitch.

I know they say it gets easier, but right now it just feels like endless struggle. Sometimes I can relax and just enjoy the cuddles but I thought I'd be so much better at this 😭",3,1744122005.0,newborns,3,1.0,False
1jueo7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Architects/comments/1jueo7n/nyc_is_stated_occupancy_a_thing/,NYC - is stated occupancy a thing?,"Hi All 

This is a follow up to my last post about alt-1 / alt-2 building application filing in NYC.

We currently have a code consultant/ expediter from NYC that is arguing for a lower occupant load then we would design for based on the NYC code.  We have a smallish floor in a high rise, around 8000 SF, that is mainly used as a conference center for other floors.  It’s currently permitted as a general b 1:100 occupant load factor.  

We are proposing that this is counted as 1:15 occupant load factor (net).  This changes the occupant load by about 3 fold, even with all the deductions. This is based on an unconcentrated assembly load of tables and chairs.

Our expediter is saying that we should base the load on a count of the seats in the conference rooms only (not even the seats in the coffee break area or other lounge spaces). This is leading them to get the same occupant load as what is currently permitted.  We don’t believe this is correct.  They are saying this is done for every project in NYC.

Our only resolution is to see if the building commissioner (DOB) can weigh in on this being okay.  Our expediter is still arguing with us about how we’re wrong and this is not required. 

Can I get a gut check from this group about whether this is standard practice in NYC?  It’s sounding very shady to me.  I feel like I am living one of those licensing exam questions related to ethics.

I should also add that he is proposing that we file for professional certification alt-2 filing, so we don’t have a normal city review.  ",1,1744121899.0,Architects,16,1.0,False
1jueo1j,https://i.redd.it/yjh9f7ordmte1.jpeg,Attention all art lovers: I created an Art Gacha that will surprise you! (And it’s cheaper than your daily coffee),"Hey there, fellow humans! 👋

I’m a broke artist trying to make ends meet, so I decided to create something FUN and quirky to bring a little joy into your life — and let’s face it, maybe I need a bit of joy too. It’s called **ArtGacha**. Here’s how it works:

1. You send me a photo (nothing crazy, just something you like).
2. You throw me a tip (it’s literally cheaper than your daily coffee, I promise ☕).
3. I’ll send you back a hand-drawn surprise based on that photo! 🎨

It’s completely random. No requests, no expectations. You’ll get something totally unique, and trust me, it might be the best thing you see all week (or at least one of the weirdest). 😉

So if you want to support a broke artist (me!) and enjoy a random surprise, go ahead and try it out. You might just get something you didn’t know you needed in your life! 💥

1jueo0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1jueo0q/places_you_liked_to_stay_a_it_longer/,Places you liked to stay a it longer,"Im noticing that I feel less and less like specific sightseeing and just like to be in a pretty place and do some day to day things, read walke alot,, swim, have coffees, read and meet people etc.

What are the places you really liked in this way and stayed for longer?

Hwre are some of mine where i stayed between 2 and 3 weeks, and why:

- Hoi An:
Though very touristy I really loved it. Very pretty (love good architecture), good vibes, lots of nice restaurant, and the beach only a short but nice ride away with a nice little villages to stay and eat that felt like it's own seperate little world. I liked that it's seperate so you are not just at the beach in the same town, but it's close enough to easy commute back and forward even en couple times a day. Also there are more travelers staying there a little longer wich helps with meeting people.

- Oaxaca, Mexico:
Again, amazing architecture. Not too big of a city, or at least it doesnt felt like that. Great food scene, many travelers there for a longer time, and my hostel was kind of small and had a pool. Easy to meet amost everyone staying and a nice place to just spend part of the day.


- Mexico City (La Roma/Condesa):
Very pleasantly suprised by rhe overall feel, and wow itst the greenest city (neigbourhoods) that I have ever seen!


- Palolem, Goa:
Amazing half moon shaped bay with lush jungles around, great for taking daytrips on scooters, sometimes waves for bodyboarding, lots of nice places to eat and its a nice mix of Indian and foreign tourist, unlike many places in Thailand that have been almost fully taken over


- Mumbai:
Been many times and I still love this city. The first time was largely completed by the group of people I met before and who joined me there and others that joined the group there. So there's that offcourse. I love this city lostly because large parts of it feel so authenric, but still like a modern busteling city. It's overall a different kind of traveler then you'll find in Bangkok for example, though they are very much different I think I prefer Mumbai

Attached is a super high-tech (lol) grid layout of the room. The space is *basically* an open-concept living/dining area, but there is some division between the rooms with the old french door frame and I’m trying to figure out where to put all my main pieces:

# What I’m working with:

* Couch (standard 3-seater)
* TV & stand
* Armchair
* Coffee table
* Kitchen/dining table (seats 4 comfortably)
* Secretary desk (small footprint, but would love it to feel intentional)

# Bonus / Hoping to Add:

* Bookshelves
* Bar cart
* Record player setup
* Any other cool touches that would vibe with a midcentury modern aesthetic (plants? rugs? art?)

# My style:

Leaning midcentury modern — I love clean lines, wood tones, vintage pieces, and warm-but-minimalist vibes. Functionally, this space needs to be cozy for movie nights but also work well for small gatherings/dinners.

# Questions for you geniuses:

* Where would you put the TV vs the couch? I’m struggling with balancing a good TV setup without making the whole room *about* the TV.
* Any thoughts on how to lay out the dining and living zones without it feeling cramped?
* Would bookshelves help ground the space or overwhelm it?
* Where would *you* put the secretary desk so it feels like a feature and not an afterthought?
* I’m all ears for bar cart, record player, or other fun accent ideas.",2,1744121724.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

Too many categories. Too many dashboards and spreadsheets. Too serious.  
And every time I forgot to log something, I felt like I was doing it wrong.

So I tried a different approach.

I built a tiny tool where I just ***chat*** about my spending — literally like texting a friend.  
Stuff like:

* “Coffee with Alex, $5. Worth it ☕”
* “Rent day 😩 $850”
* “Won $10 in poker lol

The app replies casually, adds it up, and keeps a running total.  
No pressure. Just simple, daily awareness.

Weirdly, this “chat-style logging” helped me stay consistent in a way that traditional budgeting tools never could.  
Now I use it every night for just a few seconds — and I actually feel more in control of my money.

A couple of friends tried it too, and that gave me the push to finally release it on the App Store.

You can see how it works in the screenshots — the idea is to make logging money feel more like a conversation, not a chore.

It’s still a small side project, but I’m excited to see if it helps others too.
