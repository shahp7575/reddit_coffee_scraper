So I originally updated this story as an edit to my original post, but I've heard that I should actually have done the update this way. I'll first copy/paste my original update, and then I'll give my final update. My original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hyesew/a_ghost_told_my_mom_to_invite_strangers_to_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

Update 1. (posted somewhere around 5/12/2025)

First, sorry it has taken me so long to update everyone. Things have been hectic and I have had little time to myself. That being said lets get to the update.

I had decided that while I was definitely not going to invite either Dot or Martha to my wedding, there was no harm in reaching out. I expressed this to my mom and she gave me $300 cash that she had been ""squirreling away"" (why does she need to squirrel away cash?) and told me that I should invite Martha and Dot out to a ""nice dinner"" and invite another friend to come as well. I told her that I was absolutely NOT going to do that as that's INSANE and I don't want to seem like I became a serial killer somewhere in the last 20 years. I told her that I was just going to invite Dot to coffee. She gave me the money anyway and said, ""Do what you want to but here's the money"". I ended up using the money for wedding expenses, lol. I messaged Dot via Facebook messenger, explaining who I was and asking if she wanted to get coffee. A few days later, she responded that she would, and we met up the next week for coffee (which we each purchased on our own, lol). We ended up talking for a few hours, and it was very nice catching up with someone with whom I had shared a friendship as a child. I told her that I was getting married soon, and she congratulated me but made it clear that she did not expect to be invited. She gave me a rundown on how all the siblings were doing, and we chit-chatted for a bit. She seemed to be doing fine. The usual problems of being young in society (just got out of a not great relationship, doing some intentional singleness, just moved in with a sibling because she couldn't afford her rent anymore bc rents are expensive, etc.), but still doing well nonetheless. She also told me about Martha, who seems to be doing well. Maybe they are not following their faith closely, but my being friends with her would never have fixed that. While I am not shy about evangelizing, there is a difference between telling people about God and actively trying to get them to change their behaviors. If such changes don't come from within, they have not actually changed in any significant or lasting way. I don't push like that in my personal relationships. In any case, when we were done she asked for my number and I gave it to her and she said she would love to rekindle our friendship and would reach out again. She never texted me, I still don't have her number, and this was all about 4 months ago, so my guess is that she isn't going to be contacting me anytime soon. Now, this does not bother me at all. I have about as many friends as I can reasonably keep up with at this point, and I really don't need more. Anyway, I thought it was all over and done with until my mom brought it up about a month and change later. She asked when I was going to go out with Dot and Martha. After explaining that while I had not gone out with Martha, I had gone to coffee with Dot and we had talked for a few hours, I continued on with my evening. Now instead of the typical ""Oh, that's good. I hope it went well"" it was ""WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!???"". Now see, I didnt think I¬†*had*¬†to tell her anything about a coffee date she had made me go on. This is not the first time she has made me go on a friend date with someone and usually she doesn't particularly care to hear how things went. Really, all that usually happens is that she asks me months later if I still talk to that person, and invariably, I tell her ""no"" because she's actually a terrible judge of who I will and will not get along with.

Anyway, I explained that I didn't think I needed to tell her and that it wasn't that big of a deal. We just got coffee and chit-chatted. Well her first question went something like ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU JUST WENT TO GET COFFEE, I GAVE YOU $300!!!???"" After the ringing in my ears subsided, I reminded her that I had specifically told her that I didn't need or want the money and that she had given it to me anyway. When she demanded to know what I had used it for, I explained that she had made a very generous donation to my wedding decoration fund and that the money had been used and was gone. That really should have been the end of the conversation, but she wanted to know more.

Mother - How are Dot and her siblings doing?

Me - Fine.

Mother - Is Dot working right now?

Me - Yeah.

Mother - What in?

Me- \*shrug\* Never asked.

Mother - You talked for 5 hours and didn't ask?

Me - She never mentioned it, and I don't pry.

The conversation went back and forth like this for a little bit. Mother prying, me grey rocking. Then, of course, the information she wanted the whole time.

Mother - Is Dot in a relationship currently?

Me - That's really not your business.

Mother - Why won't you tell me!?

Me - Because I wouldn't want anyone running around telling strangers my business if I were in the same situation?

Well, this bit of honesty was yet another blunder on my part because how dare I insinuate that she is a stranger to Dot (because she is). She knew Dot's mother well! (20 years ago) I'm acting like she had asked for Dot's Social Security number! (Am I?) Is it some sort of secret? (No?) Why can't she know!? (Is that a real question?)

I explained to her that I had agreed to go out with Dot, but I never agreed to be my mother's informant. I told her that if she really wanted to know what was going on in Dot's personal life, then maybe she should ask Miss Tina.

Now, that was a low blow, I know, and my mom looked quite hurt by that one, and I felt bad for that. I was just really frustrated and couldn't control it anymore. I never apologized for that particular cheap shot, and I likely should, but that's not entirely the point right now. The conversation functionally ended with that shot and I went out to Bjorn's house to get some peace. My mom apologized to me the next morning for being hurtful to me.

Its only two weeks and change till the wedding now and I've put as many safeguards in place to make sure that nothing too crazy happens in the meantime. I don't need to set passwords with my vendors as all the services I'm using utilized password protected services and I have a couple of friends stepping in as mother minders and security (we're calling them the Bringers of Destruction ((BOD for short)) and have given them the designations of The Orc and The Assassins). Every couple days my mom brings me something that she is very proud of and that she spent a bunch of money on that I have no desire to use or that doesn't fit with existing decorations, theming, or planning. For example, she bought a bunch of potted Calla Lilies to take photos with. When I informed her that the women would be getting ready at Bjorn's family home because he lives two literal blocks from the church and we would have more time that way, she lost her mind because I hadn't told her. Now, this was a decision that had just been made, but that didn't matter because I should have informed her 2 milliseconds after I made the decision. Honestly, it wouldn't have mattered anyway because she thinks it's stupid and keeps giving me grief about it, confirming my original suspicion that the issue was just that I didn't choose what she wanted to do. She also wants to get me a bunch of stickers that I don't want and paper cups that she thinks will be keepsakes to put the stickers on (they won't, they're paper coffee cups without lids). She's also very hurt that I don't talk to her or involve her with any decisions I'm making. Honestly, she doesn't like any of my choices anyway, so why would I share my decision process with her?

Anyway, that's my update. I hope nothing too crazy happens so close to the wedding, but we'll see. I'll post one more update after the wedding and let you all know how it went.

I appreciate your support and kind words everyone! Thanks for reading!

Final Update!

Ok so we are now 6 days post-wedding and I am enjoying wedded bliss at my own apartment away from my family home, experiencing true peace and relaxation for the first time in years. I had no idea how toxic my former home environment was until I woke up for the first time here in my own place and didn't feel like I needed to hide in my bedroom until I was awake enough to deal with the chaos waiting for me outside my bedroom door. I can go to my own kitchen and make my own cappuccino and not need to be prepared to answer 1000 questions about my day and life immediately after waking and before I've even had anything to eat. It has been marvelous. And of course, there are other very fun consequences to sharing a home with the man I love (hehehehehehe >: ) .

The last few weeks before my wedding were absolute chaos. I was in a car accident where my car was totaled (I am ok, a little sore and lucky to be alive, but ok), all of the cantors for my wedding mass pulled out for different reasons (most of them legitimate) in the weeks before, my younger brother (19M) who was composing a piece for my wedding mass got mad at me (I still don't know what about. The kid had autism and I often don't understand what's up when he gets mad because he often doesn't know himself) and decided that he wasn't going to let me use his composition for my wedding and also that he wasn't coming, and then of course if not having a car or music was enough 1 week beforehand I got strep throat. It was wild and crazy and all very difficult to handle, and then on top of it all, I was dealing with my mother hating all of my decisions, such as where/when I chose to get my wedding cake, being angry at me for getting sick and not wanting to be around people, being nasty to my sister (39F) over the fact that she had recently gained weight again, asking 100 million questions about things she did not actually need to know (even though I had specifically asked her to stop asking me questions) and getting mad when I didn't eat food that I hadn't asked for before it got cold (she does this all the time. She'll make food without being asked as an act of love and then get pissed off when you're busy and can't eat immediately because she made it and its going to get cold). It's no wonder I ended up with strep, considering all of the stress I was under.

Then as a cherry on top, my husband's grandmother was threatening not to come because she was mad about a completely unrelated thing my Brother in Law (26M) did, my uncle was asking us to postpone the wedding or else he wouldn't attend, my cousins and older brother told me they weren't coming, I needed to quit my second job because I was being mistreated, and my photographer that I had made a whole plan with and gotten to know got injured and was unable to make the wedding so I needed to find a new one. All of this happened in the 10 days leading up to the wedding with the cousins and photographer happening the literal day before. There was sooooooooo much stress, and I felt like I was going to die.

All of that being said my husband and bridesmaids really came through for me. I was taken to the doctor and got some PUNCHY antibiotics, and the ladies came together and got all the remaining decorations done whilst I convalesced. My cake topper came in the day before the wedding with just enough time for me to paint it, my husband took me out for dinner the night before to destress, make sure I was ok, and help us recenter on the fact that we were about to join our lives together. By the grace of GOD, one of the groomsmen's sister is a professional church cantor and stepped in to provide the music at a steep discount. This though I barely knew her (she's my best friend now, she just doesn't know it yet). My other little brother (26M) was also suddenly able to come when we didn't think he would make it, and he grabbed his guitar and helped to cantor the mass. My youngest brother (the angry autistic one) decided that, despite his rage, he wanted to go as well, and my mom actually went too, even though she wasn't planning to.

The morning was super hectic with getting ready, getting the new photographer up to speed, and making sure all the decorations got to the church on time. Everyone rallied to get everything done and before I knew it I was walking down the aisle, arm-in-arm with my Daddy, and singing at the top of my lungs that I belong to my beloved, and his whole desire is for me (Song of Songs 7:10). We had a wonderful mass and the cheers at our first kiss made me want to cry. Our reception was equally lovely with a live jazz band, good food, and great beer (we were at a brewery), and there was so much love in that room. My Bringers of Destruction worked overtime to make sure that if there were any problems, we did not know about them. I cannot WAIT to hear all the stories.

More than anything, I married the man I love, surrounded by people I love and who love me. There were no strangers. There was no drama that I was aware of. In all, our day was perfect, and now I am sitting in our home looking back on everything and thanking God for every single person who loved us enough to make our day perfect.

Thanks for reading Petty Potatoes! And thank you for your support and words of encouragement up to this point. It's 2 am and I'm going to go curl up in bed with my beautiful husband.

She‚Äôs one of those people who is calm without trying, the kind who makes sitting with a book look like a peaceful superpower. She has a really genuine smile and laugh that hits me every time, like she is fully present and not faking it for anyone.

On day one, before I ever talked to her, I ordered cheesecake, coffee, and bottled water. Just a normal order. Then the next day, I saw her sitting alone reading. I kind of panicked and awkwardly asked her what she usually orders. My tone and body language were all over the place. But she was kind. She answered, then asked me what I usually get, which caught me off guard in the best way. It was not just small talk. It was connection.

We have talked every single day since then.

The conversations have not been deep or dramatic or anything like that, just real, chill, and easy. Every day I have been looking forward to seeing her again. But today something happened that made me stop.

She looked at me and smiled, then said,  
**‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre here for the menu.‚Äù**

And I froze. Because she was right.

I had not even realized it but for the past 15 days, I have only been ordering bottled water. That is it. Every single time. No coffee. No cheesecake. Just bottled water. Not on purpose. I think I have just been too caught up in the idea of talking to her again. I would walk in, spot her, and everything else would just fade.

And she noticed. Without me ever saying anything. She saw right through me gently, like it was not a big deal, like she already knew and was just waiting for me to catch up.

I do not know what this is turning into or if it will turn into anything at all. But right now, I am just sitting with the fact that someone saw me without me having to explain a thing. And that feels rare and kind of beautiful.",1,1749190141.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Hoping some of you seasoned lifters can help me out with a super annoying issue I've been having. 

When I go for a really heavy deadlift (mostly on 1RMs), I get this weird sensation of gas/air/acid right in the middle of my chest when I try to brace. It's not painful like heartburn, but it's enough to completely break my focus and stop me from actually lifting the weight.

My routine is usually to train about 1-2 hours after waking up. For breakfast, I typically have Swedish kvarg (it's like a thicker, high-protein yogurt) and a coffee.

Has anyone experienced this? What do you do to avoid it? I'm open to any tips, whether it's related to pre-lift nutrition, bracing technique, or anything else.

1l4kpoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1l4kpoj/possible_cause_and_treatment/,Possible Cause and Treatment,"I am excited to share what I believe are groundbreaking findings. ALL things line up and my many rabbit holes I‚Äôve gone down have finally connected. This may not apply to all and I don‚Äôt expect to have solved the worlds issues BUT I believe this may help many of us.

Firstly, I‚Äôve become a closet research scientist and geneticist and have garnished insights from people‚Äôs genetics who had similar symptoms and issues with their health. 

Next, I did multiple trials on myself the most recent one which made me severely ill (an intended outcome). The long winding road is complex but this is my health issue and fix. 

It seems in the body there are two paths to lower oxidative stress through the creation of glutathione. One pathway which enlists the help of a solute carrier gene (SLC25a38) and connects to ALAS2 gene is also responsible for folate and B6 transport. This particular gene is also responsible for carrying glycine to the mitochondria (I react severely to glycine). Whilst there is limited research on this gene, there are articles that point to its links to all cause cancer both leukemia and tumors. It is also associated with congenital sideroblastic anaemia, Marfan syndrome, porphyria, Charcot Marie tooth disease and osteo issues. I am confirmed to have a susceptibility to lead poisoning in ALAS2 which is summise is due to disrupted glycine metabolism due to SLC25a38. I have also confirmed I have a folate trap (likely due to the congenital sideroblastic anaemia). Others I have spoken to are unknown if these genes are an issue but genes within this pathway are defective which leads to glutathione deficiency. 

Now‚Ä¶. This is where is gets really interesting‚Ä¶ IF the above pathway is defective, there is another way the body can produce glutathione which involves the introduction of certain substances. This pathway is part of the CYP450 enzyme family or more specifically CYP2e1. If you take ‚Äúinducers‚Äù and these inducers are nicotene, benzene, hard cheeses, fatty fish and red meats, butter, ethanol, heavy cream, colchicine (gout medication) this helps the body produce glutathione which in turn detoxes the liver.  Ethanol however is a double edged sword as it is also a substrate which is bad. 

So to lay this out‚Ä¶ hypothetically if your issue is somewhere in this genetic pathway which supports glutathione production, then you MUST induce the CYP2e1 pathway. If you inhibit CYP2e1 then you will have no way for your body to eliminate oxidative stress which leads to severe abdominal pain, bloat, a strangling sensation of the small intestine, vomiting and in some circumstances diarrhea and of course vitamin malabsorption. Not to mention worsening anaemia due to oxidative stress. In this scenario, there is a deficiency in B12 (due to anti parietal cells and normal MMA), a functional folate deficit (folate trap) and B6 anaemia which can present as very high B6. Basically a trifecta of anaemia and additionally vitamin D deficiency as vitamin D requires folate, magnesium and other B vitamins. 

So what foods and or medication ‚Äúinhibit‚Äù Cyp2e1 (this is by no means an exhaustive list please do your own research) -
Foods that contain bergamottin:
Citrus fruits:
Grapefruit
Limes
Seville oranges
Pomelo
Bergamot (Citrus bergamia)
Other foods:
Celery
Parsnips

Salicylic acid (an excipient in many medications)
Garlic
Soya Sauce
Seed oils
Eggs
Black tea / green tea
Polyethylene Glycol (in many medications and vaccines)
Propofol
Bromazepam
Fruits and vegetables high in salicylates such as tomatoes and cucumbers. 
Polyphenols also seem to inhibit (coffee, blackberries) - although I hate to give up coffee so instead have added heavy cream to try to offset the effects. 

What foods / other stuff induce Cyp2e1
Nicotene (I believe this is why long covid sufferers have success with nicotene gum, sprays or patches) - I have run a test and the gum is the most successful
Fatty fish like salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel, prawns
Omega 3 (everyone knows omega 3 detoxes the body I believe it is because it is an inducer)
Fatty meats lamb, steak etc
Ethanol (but a double edged sword)
Hard cheeses
Heavy cream 
Butter
Ascorbic acid
‚Ä¶ similar to the carnivore and/or keto but you can add vegetables such as carrots or potatoes and white rice as I can‚Äôt find evidence they either induce or inhibit hence are safe. 

When you induce cyp2e1, in theory you increase production of glutathione and detox the liver and lower oxidative stress. I know it sounds completely bizarre that nicotene is a detox but I have also found evidence that nicotene increases cyp enzymes which has been scientifically shown to reduce the risk of Parkinson‚Äôs. - you can find these articles by searching google. Note the keto/carnivore style diet is also high in riboflavin and B6 which is believe supports the reduction in anaemia. Key point however is the absolute must to ensure you have FAT and lots of it. 

A few nights ago I put my theory to the test. So off I went to a Chinese restaurant and loaded up on garlic soya sauce foods for a few hours.. within a few hours of returning home, my ankles blew up into balloons, I was leaning over the big white toilet, my heart rate rocketed and I had the usual intense abdominal pain. The inhibitors did what I expected them to do.. so the next day to recover I started chewing nicotene gum, ate some salmon and had some heavy cream in my coffee (coffee should in theory be avoided) with sugar as yes sugar also helps me. Within minutes of adding the inducers my heartrate went from 100 back down to 75-80 my normal range. 

So now for my wild theory‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never had Covid.. I believe it‚Äôs because i naturally lean towards foods that are inducers of cyp2e1 (I have avoided fruit most of my life).. BUT I also found research articles that benzene is proven to have antiviral properties in mouse models. Yes I am a smoker‚Ä¶. Benzene is also an inducer and is part of glutathione production via the cyp2e1 pathway. But I‚Äôm not advocating you all start smoking coz cigarettes also contain other bad sh.t. But for those that recognise foods you have issues with on the inhibitor list.. you may want to try nicotene gum as a rescue when you get yourself into a bad situation similar to my soya sauce challenge. I also have success with the age old Kiwi tradition of quickeze aka magnesium carbonate. 

Allergies I do not believe are ‚Äúallergies‚Äù but are instead our bodies inability to reduce oxidative stress due to a genetic polymorphism which impacts our glutathione production. The path to health is identifying and correlating the things that make you unwell with the things that make you feel good. It‚Äôs taking me close to two years after going down hundreds of rabbit holes to find a picture that completely fits all my health issues and I NOW know what foods to avoid and can make the lifestyle changes for good health. Once my vitamin levels normalise with the restricted diet approach I have no doubt my anaemia will resolve and I will be able to occasionally have the bad stuff. For now I feel I‚Äôve scientifically explained why nicotene provides relief for those with long covid. I have requested a custom gene panel at Mayo targeting 14 genes to validate my theory.

For now, that‚Äôs a wrap and I hope I didn‚Äôt bore you with my closet science from the non scientist but instead a fellow sufferer who has read close to 100,000 research papers and ran all sorts of crazy random diet and health challenges to get to this answer üòÇ",1,1749187973.0,MCAS,2,0.67,False

1l4kmn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1l4kmn2/the_dream_beneath_a_dream_bathing_the_lion_by/,The Dream Beneath a Dream: Bathing the Lion by Jonathan Carroll,"Jonathan Carroll doesn't write pure fantasy books. Not really, but in his books you will encounter situations where dreams are pressurized memories, where your dog might be a guardian angel, and where a cup of coffee might suddenly, and without warning, remind you of the moment you chose to forget who you are.

Bathing the Lion begins in a small New England town with five people, some friends, some strangers, who all share the same dream. One‚Äôs on a plane bound for Europe when it happens, but it still finds him. The dream is vivid, cosmic, impossible. But more importantly, it‚Äôs a trigger. Because these aren‚Äôt just ordinary people. They‚Äôre former agents of a distant order, a pre-human intelligence, who once helped shape the architecture of the universe and who willingly erased their own memories to live human lives. Until now.

No one writes stories quite like Jonathan Carroll.

Carroll‚Äôs The Land of Laughs introduced us to a world where fiction literally creates reality, a schoolteacher discovers that a beloved children‚Äôs author‚Äôs imaginary town might still be alive and growing, fed by belief. In Bones of the Moon, a grieving woman travels nightly into a dreamland shaped by her subconscious, where the search for mythical coins mirrors her real-life trauma. These books touch on magic, but they‚Äôre really about something deeper: how fragile our grasp on reality truly is. And how much we want that fragility.

With White Apples and Glass Soup, Carroll got stranger. The dead return, cities collapse into metaphor, and the afterlife is rendered as a kind of mythological bureaucracy. But even there, it‚Äôs never about spectacle. It's about grief. About love. About what it means to keep choosing this life, this messy, boring, glorious human life, again and again, even when we remember what came before.

Bathing the Lion feels like the culmination of that long arc. It‚Äôs as though all the furniture from the earlier novels, talking animals, surreal dreams, divine purpose, the battle between meaning and chaos, has been rearranged into a final, haunting tableau. The Watchers, the dreamscape, the choice between forgetfulness and cosmic duty, it‚Äôs all quietly devastating. Because Carroll, beneath all the metaphysics, is asking a very human question:

What if the most important thing you ever did was leave it all behind to live an ordinary life?

Unlike the apocalyptic antics of Neil Gaiman‚Äôs Good Omens, which skims across the surface of Armageddon with charming irreverence, Carroll‚Äôs apocalypse is intimate. It doesn't arrive with horsemen or prophecies. It arrives in your kitchen. It arrives when your spouse leaves the room and you suddenly remember you were once a god.

There‚Äôs no Antichrist here, only the gentle unravelling of personal truths. And yet, both books share a deep spiritual kinship. They understand that the world might be absurd, but it is lovingly absurd. That the systems governing reality may be broken or beautiful, but they are, above all, ours.

Bathing the Lion is a quieter, lonelier book than most of Carroll‚Äôs others. There‚Äôs less whimsy than in The Wooden Sea, fewer outright flourishes than Sleeping in Flame. But there‚Äôs a stillness to it, like snow falling over a hidden machine. A machine that might just remember your name.

And then there‚Äôs the lion.

Its meaning arrives late, soft-footed and strange, like a riddle whispered after a dream. You‚Äôll think about it for days. That‚Äôs how Carroll works. He doesn‚Äôt tell you what anything means. He just leaves the door open, the footprints in the snow, and lets you decide whether to follow.

So here‚Äôs the choice:

Do you want to remember who you were before the world began?

Or do you want to wake up beside someone you love, make coffee, and forget again, gratefully, deliberately?

Carroll doesn‚Äôt answer. He never does. But his books ask the question in ways no one else dares. And Bathing the Lion might just be his most elegant, most aching question yet.",1,1749187653.0,fantasy_books,0,1.0,False

>In a land where dragons run coffee shops, witches run beauty pageants, and nothing makes any sense, three wildly unqualified princes--one on the run from the law, one searching for greatness, and one who runs a pig farm--are thrust into a chaotic quest to restore the powers of an immortal, reality-altering cosmic being in exchange for three wishes. Armed with questionable plot-twists, inherited trauma, and the combined competency of a wooden spoon, these boys must bumble through sentient forests, battle melodramatic villains, and confront their own destinies. ""Mulberry Veils and Crooked Trails"" is a semi-modern fantasy comedy where almost everything is sentient, the laws of physics are mostly rumours, and quests rarely go according to plot.

# Best Stainless Steel Funnel 2025: Top Picks & Reviews

The stainless steel funnel is an indispensable tool in both professional and home settings, simplifying the transfer of liquids and fine-grained substances. This seemingly simple device ensures mess-free pouring, prevents spills, and speeds up various tasks from filling bottles in commercial kitchens to transferring oils in automotive maintenance. With a wide array of models available, selecting the best stainless steel funnel for your needs requires careful consideration of size, design, and material quality.

This article aims to guide you through the top stainless steel funnels anticipated for 2025, offering detailed reviews and comparisons to help you make an informed decision. Weather you're a home cook, bartender, or work in an industrial environment, finding the right funnel can significantly enhance efficiency and cleanliness.

## Key Features Analysis

The finest stainless steel funnels distinguish themselves through several crucial features that enhance their functionality and durability. These features directly impact the funnel's performance and lifespan, making them essential considerations when making a purchase.**Material Composition:** A high-quality stainless steel funnel should be crafted from food-grade 18/8 (304) stainless steel. This composition offers excellent corrosion resistance, preventing rust and ensuring longevity, even with frequent exposure to various liquids and substances. the higher chromium and nickel content contribute to the material's superior durability and resistance to staining,maintaining its polished appearance for years to come.

The use of thinner, less corrosion-resistant stainless steel can lead to pitting and rust over time, especially when used with acidic or salty substances. Thus, always verify the stainless steel grade to ensure optimal performance and durability.

**Funnel Neck Design:** The design of the funnel neck is critical to its performance. A wider neck diameter facilitates faster pouring, essential for quickly transferring large volumes of liquids or granular materials. The angle of the funnel neck also influences the flow rate; a steeper angle generally allows for quicker dispensing, while a gentler slope can prevent splashing and bubbling, notably when pouring carbonated beverages or viscous liquids.

some funnels feature grooved inner surfaces or spiral designs within the neck to further enhance flow rate and minimize airlocks. These features are particularly beneficial when working with thicker liquids that tend to pour slowly.

**Handle and Grip Features:** A sturdy handle provides a secure grip, preventing the funnel from slipping or tilting during use. Ergonomic handles designed for comfortable handling reduce hand fatigue, especially during extended use. Some models include incorporated clips or hooks,facilitating secure attachment to containers,thereby freeing both hands for pouring.

Look for features like textured grips and finger rests that improve control and stability. Stainless steel handles are preferred for their durability and resistance to bending or breaking under pressure.

**Filter Integration:** Certain stainless steel funnels come equipped with built-in filters that efficiently strain out unwanted particles and impurities during liquid transfer. These filters are typically made of fine mesh stainless steel, preventing sediment, pulp, and other solids from entering the receiving container. Filter integration is particularly beneficial.Removable filters are easier to clean and maintain, allowing for the removal of trapped debris and preventing clogs. Integrated filters also enhance the versatility of the funnel, enabling it to be used for a wider range of applications.**Spout Length and Diameter:** The spout of the funnel must be appropriately sized to fit into various containers without overflowing. A longer spout is useful for reaching into narrow-necked bottles or containers, preventing spills and ensuring accuracy during transfer.The spout's diameter dictates the flow rate, with wider spouts allowing for quicker pouring of larger volumes.

Consider the range of containers you typically fill when selecting a funnel with the appropriate spout dimensions. A set of funnels with varying spout lengths and diameters provides versatility for different applications.

## core Benefits

The stainless steel funnel offers a multitude of benefits beyond simply preventing spills. These benefits contribute to improved efficiency, safety, and overall convenience in various contexts.

**Enhanced Pouring Precision:** Stainless steel funnels significantly improve pouring accuracy by directing liquids precisely into the desired container. This precision minimizes waste and prevents messy spills,particularly when working with costly or hazardous materials. The funnel's design ensures a controlled flow, reducing the chance of splattering and maintaining a cleaner workspace.

Improved accuracy also reduces the risk of errors,such as overfilling containers or mixing incorrect ratios of ingredients. This is especially crucial in professional culinary, chemical, and industrial environments.

**Simplified Transfer of Powders and Granules:** Besides liquids, stainless steel funnels are extremely helpful for transferring powders, grains, and other granular substances cleanly and efficiently. The funnel's smooth, non-stick surface allows these materials to flow freely without clumping or sticking, minimizing waste and preventing dust clouds. This feature streamlines tasks like filling spice jars, transferring ingredients during baking, or pouring fertilizers in gardening applications.

Using a funnel ensures that powders are directed into the container without scattering, keeping the working area clean and reducing the need for extensive cleanup.

**Reduced Mess and Waste:** By directing liquids and granular substances into specific containers, stainless steel funnels help minimize drips, spills, and overall mess. This reduction in waste saves materials, reduces cleanup time, and creates a safer working environment by preventing slippery surfaces and potential hazards.The funnel's design prevents valuable ingredients from being wasted or damaged.

Even small spills can add up over time, especially in high-volume environments. A funnel is a simple yet effective tool for maintaining cleanliness and reducing unnecessary material loss.

## FAQs Section

**Are stainless steel funnels dishwasher safe?**
Yes, most stainless steel funnels are dishwasher safe. This makes cleaning and sanitizing them convenient, especially after handling oily or sticky substances. Check the manufacturer's specifications to confirm, but generally, stainless steel can withstand the high temperatures and harsh detergents used in dishwashers. Though, hand washing is usually sufficient if you want to preserve the original luster for a longer period.

**Can stainless steel funnels withstand hot liquids?**
Yes, stainless steel funnels can safely handle hot liquids. Stainless steel's high melting point ensures that it remains stable and doesn't leach any chemicals into the liquid, even at boiling temperatures. It is suitable for transferring hot oils in cooking or for decanting hot beverages like coffee or tea.**Do stainless steel funnels react with acidic substances?**
High-quality stainless steel funnels, typically made from 18/8 (304) stainless steel, offer excellent resistance to acidic substances such as vinegar, lemon juice, and tomato sauce. However, prolonged exposure to highly concentrated acids might cause minor surface etching over time. for optimal longevity, it is indeed recommended to wash and dry the funnel promptly after use with acidic materials.

1l4k8gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1l4k8gv/what_happened_when_my_water_cup_moved_across_the/,What happened when my water cup moved across the table today seemingly by itself?,"Please no hate. I don‚Äôt think this was a ghost or anything, I just want to understand what happened. 

I had a cup of ice water today at work, the kind of single-use plastic cup you get from coffee shops. There was a lid with one of those sippy-cup like things on it, and a straw. It had a lot of condensation, the outside of the cup was fairly wet. The ice was almost nearly all melted. 

I work on the ground level, no shakes from cars, no earthquakes. No one else was in the room. I was scared I hallucinated, so I rolled back my security footage and it indeed moved. 

I glanced at the cup and watched as it moved an inch or two across the table. It was a smooth, gradual movement. 

I noticed that it left a small trail of condensation in its wake. 

I am assuming that something about the shape of the bottom of the cub created a suction to the table with the water from the condensation eventually building up to push it forward.

## Key Features Analysis

The beehive cup market boasts a diverse range of options, each with its unique selling points. From handcrafted artisan pieces to mass-produced functional designs,understanding the key features is crucial to choosing the right cup for your needs.

**Material Composition**

The material used in a beehive cup substantially impacts its durability,aesthetics,and thermal properties.Common materials include glass, ceramic, stainless steel, and even plastic. Glass beehive cups often showcase the beverage within, adding to the visual appeal, while ceramic cups offer excellent heat retention. Stainless steel options are known for their robustness and insulation capabilities. Plastic cups provide affordability and lightweight convenience, though they may sacrifice on aesthetics and durability compared to other materials.The choice depends on factors such as intended use, budget, and aesthetic preferences.

**Honeycomb Design**

The defining characteristic of a beehive cup is, of course, its honeycomb pattern. This pattern can range from subtle indentations to highly pronounced geometric structures. The depth and complexity of the honeycomb design not only affect the cup's visual texture but also its grip and insulation. A more intricate honeycomb design can improve the cup's ability to dissipate heat, keeping your hands cooler when holding hot beverages. Conversely, a shallow honeycomb might be easier to clean but offer less grip.

**Size and Capacity**

Beehive cups come in a range of sizes,from small espresso cups to larger mugs and even pint glasses. The ideal size depends on the beverage you intend to serve. Smaller cups, typically holding 6-8 ounces, are perfect for coffee, tea, or small cocktails. medium-sized cups, with a capacity of 10-14 ounces, are suitable for everyday use and can accommodate a variety of beverages. Larger beehive cups,holding 16 ounces or more,are ideal for iced drinks,beers,or those who prefer larger servings.

**Ergonomics and Handle Design**

While the beehive's shape offers a unique aesthetic, its ergonomics are equally crucial. Some beehive cups feature handles, which can greatly enhance comfort, especially when handling hot liquids. The handle design can vary from classic C-shaped handles to more modern and angular designs. Handleless beehive cups rely on the honeycomb pattern to provide a secure grip. The choice between a handled and handleless design is largely a matter of personal preference and intended use.

**Durability and Maintenance**

The longevity of a beehive cup is affected by both the material used and the manufacturing quality. Glass cups, especially those made from borosilicate glass, are typically more resistant to thermal shock and breakage. Ceramic cups can be prone to chipping, while stainless steel cups are generally the most durable. Consider the maintenance requirements of each material; some materials are dishwasher safe, while others require hand washing to prevent damage or discoloration.

**Aesthetic Variations**

Beyond the basic honeycomb shape,beehive cups exhibit a wide range of aesthetic variations. These can include different colors, textures, and finishes. Some cups feature glossy glazes, while others have a more matte or rustic appearance. Some designs incorporate additional decorative elements, such as gold accents or intricate patterns.The choice of aesthetic largely depends on your personal style and the overall ambiance you wish to create.

The textured surface of a beehive cup, created by its honeycomb pattern, provides a superior grip compared to smooth-walled cups. The indentations offer multiple points of contact for your fingers, reducing the risk of slippage. This is especially beneficial when handling hot beverages or when your hands are wet. The tactile experience of holding a beehive cup can be surprisingly satisfying, adding a sensory dimension to your drinking ritual.**Improved Insulation**

The honeycomb design can also contribute to improved insulation. The air pockets created within the honeycomb pattern help to reduce the rate of heat transfer, keeping hot beverages warmer for longer and preventing your hands from burning. While not as effective as dedicated insulated mugs, the beehive design offers a noticeable enhancement over standard cups. The level of insulation also depends on the material used, with ceramic and stainless steel offering the best performance.

The husband moves his car on his own when he sees us home or when he hears us complaining na harang na yung tapat ng gate. 

Kaninang umaga I woke up to the person who takes care of their child na nagwawalis sa labas. I was looking through the window at first and noticed parang nilalagay lang yung extrang kalat sa labas so I opened the door and watched for a bit. I didn't say anything. Then she started using the dustpan and placing their trash (na kadalasan sa tapat ko din ang tapon kasi nahaharangan ng sasakyan yung part nila) back sa tapat nila as well as some plants na nalampas. Our wall's a different color from theirs so there was a clear divide. I don't use their space out of respect pero ewan ko na din lang sa kanila. The thing with the plants is they have a  lot of it. One of the reasons why wala sila space for their trash nung una. They had a cactus na natumba last bagyo that they didn't bother fixing so nakahara sa faucet sa labas. Fixed that too. Anyway, when the helper came out a again, I reminded her nicely that their trash should be nasa tapat nila. 

Now while I was boiling water for coffee kanina, I heard her say somewhere along the lines of  'Ang arte ng kapitbahay mo, para halaman lang yung lumampas.' and so on to her crying toddler. I would've understood her behavior since baka overwhelmed lang but she said that with the neighbors out (relatives din ata). I walked slowly palabas, making sure kung ako nga pa pinaparinggan. I went out and clarified na it wasn't about the plants, even if it was, I'll just return it sa tapat nila, it was about the trash. She went 'Napakadamot di naman ikaw may-ari nyan.' since I've only been renting the place for almost 3 years na. 

Nagpantig tenga ko, I pay the necessary bills to live here so idk if she wanted to shame me for not owning the house(?) Since she went there, I also reminded her that she didn't hear anything from me when she was parking her motorycle sa tapat despite voicing out how I don't appreciate her parking her vehicles sa tapat. It's the first thing you'll see when you open the door. She went 'Wag ka mag-alala, aalis na din kami dito! Aalisin ko na yang motor mamaya!' I looked her in the eye once, willing to at least talk about it and point out why I was pissed pero she walked out. The lady na nasa tapat, approached us smiling, known chismosa and acquainted to them probably wanted to mediate. Isa pa yun. Their relative owns a kind of BnB and sometimes tells their guest to just park sa tapat. I know because I asked a guest before. 

My partner's away atm and idk if she got the courage knowing  that I'm alone. I speak out if I know I'm not wrong. Informed my friends who witnessed how pissed she was when a friend's motorcyle was a bit on her property and they also don't know what she's on. Dad called and told me wala daw silbi to talk to close-minded people. I have a feeling she's not used to people telling her no. Yun lang haha",12,1749185920.0,OffMyChestPH,9,0.88,False

I met my pAP here on Reddit after I posted my ad. She checked all my boxes for what I was looking for. A married mom in her 30's that lived close to me. It was too good to be true and that should have been a red flag. 

Our conversations ended up turning sexual maybe too quickly and that should have been red flag number 2. Of course I ignored the red flags and continued talking with her which eventually led to voice chats and finally a coffee date. Following our coffee date I was probably too emotionally invested to realize what she was about to pull. 

She immediately told me about her ex AP and how she was not completely over him. She told me that they were still chatting because he was going to loan her some money for her business. The head on my neck finally came out of my arse and started to realize something feels off. Who loans money to an affair partner? How would you even explain the missing money to your SO? 

What scares me the most about this entire ordeal is who was that person I had coffee with. Was this all just some elaborate scam that she has perfected over time. Was the end goal just to get me to loan money so that she could run away with the loot and move on to the next victim. 

Anybody else have a similar story to share about affair scams. I'm hoping this has happened to another person so we can compare notes. It's really made me double down on my OpSec where I am hestitant to even trade face pics. ",0,1749185586.0,adultery,0,0.5,False

'Coffee' in Japanese is *k≈çhƒ´* while in Gamilaraay it's *gabi*.

'Frying pan' in Korean is *huraipaen*

So then I used /h/ to approximate /f/ for '15th-19th century words'

* The Philippines - Hilibbinul, Wilibbinul < Hwilibbinul

* Facebook - /…∏eÃûs.bu.k…ô/ or /heÃûs-/ or /Œ≤ÃûeÃûs-/

1l4k1hd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4k1hd,A Love Letter to Seattle,"I spent more hours than I can count playing a small handful of games that let me immerse myself imaginatively, and Anno is one of them.  But in real life I also spent more hours than I can count walking around downtown Seattle.  The peak of this experience was in those years spanning 2009-2019.  One Summer, I worked on the 6th floor at the Macy's Department Store selling kitchen appliances, Swarovski crystals, and the occasional luggage.    
  
As a ""peasant"" who had grown up on the poor east side of Tacoma, WA, Seattle felt like stepping into a different world of promise and hope, filled with bankers and businessmen, elegant window displays, and department stores with vaulted ceilings.  The smell of coffee, the early morning street cleaners washing windows and pressure washing sidewalks - and the long waterfront strolls, breathing in the sea air of the Puget Sound and eating Clam Chowder at Ivar's.  Going up to the top of the Columbia and Smith Towers to look out over the city while drinking Starbucks, or taking in a symphony...  Seattle was my anchor point for years - promising better things to come - a bright impression in a mundane world.

Then a few tired years hit like a freight train.  The pandemic began.  I spent five years of my life far from the city, in comparatively isolated Montana.  One marriage and one divorce later, and a pandemic down the line, I found myself on a path of trying to figure life out again - and in that space, rekindled my long-abandoned love of gaming.  When I returned to Seattle, the city I loved seemed like only a shell of what I remembered.  Macy's was gone, along with many of the department stores.  I realized you can go back to old places, but you can't go back to old times.  But as I built up this city named Seattle in Crown Falls, I couldn't help but have an epiphany about why Anno is so sticky for me.

It captures the essence I first felt stepping off a bus for the first time fifteen years ago downtown Seattle - the sense of life, the sense of place, and the sense that we live in a world where anything is possible.  As we contemplate Anno 117, I imagine that I will probably remain in 1800 for quite some time.  Because somehow, the art and beauty of the game have captured the spirit of something we all wish we could feel: an echo of the age of enlightenment, in a post-modern dystopia.  It reminds us - even if it is just a game - that new horizons are still possible. ",17,1749185519.0,anno,0,0.88,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best leather tufted ottomans are distinguished by their superior construction, quality materials, and thoughtful design. The following features are crucial in evaluating the worth of any leather tufted ottoman.

**Leather Quality**

The type and grade of leather significantly impact the ottoman's durability, feel, and appearance. Top-grain leather, known for its natural grain and softness, is generally considered the highest quality, followed by full-grain and corrected-grain options.The leather should be supple to the touch and free of significant imperfections. The tanning process also affects the leather's characteristics; vegetable-tanned leather, while more expensive, offers a richer patina over time.

**Tufting Design and Execution**

Tufting refers to the technique of securing upholstery with buttons or stitching, creating a visually appealing textured surface. The quality of the tufting is determined by the evenness and depth of the tufts, as well as the quality of the buttons or stitching used. Deep and consistent tufts contribute to a more luxurious and comfortable feel. The pattern of the tufting, whether diamond, square, or buttonless, affects the overall aesthetic.

**Frame Construction**

The internal frame of the ottoman provides structural support and determines its stability and longevity. Solid hardwood frames, such as kiln-dried oak or maple, are the most durable and resistant to warping or cracking. The joints should be reinforced with corner blocks, screws, and glue for added strength. A well-constructed frame ensures that the ottoman can withstand regular use without sagging or wobbling.**Padding and Cushioning**

the padding and cushioning materials used in the ottoman effect its comfort and support. high-density foam provides a firm and supportive surface, while down or feather filling offers a softer, more luxurious feel. A combination of foam and fiberfill is often used to balance comfort and durability. The padding should be evenly distributed and well-secured to prevent shifting or bunching.

**Leg Design and Material**

The legs of the ottoman contribute to its overall style and stability. Solid wood legs, metal legs, or hidden feet are common options. The legs should be securely attached to the frame and capable of supporting the ottoman's weight without wobbling. The finish of the legs should complement the leather upholstery and the overall design of the room.

**Size and Dimensions**

The size and dimensions of the ottoman should be appropriate for the intended use and the size of the room. A larger ottoman can serve as a coffee table or extra seating, while a smaller ottoman is better suited for use as a footrest. Consider the height of the ottoman in relation to the surrounding furniture,such as sofas and chairs,to ensure a comfortable and ergonomic experiance.

## Key Features Analysis

The best silicone sleeves offer a combination of durability, flexibility, temperature resistance, and material safety. Examining thes features is crucial when selecting the right sleeve for your intended application. Thickness, durometer, and the presence of any harmful additives can substantially affect performance and longevity.

**Material Composition:** High-quality silicone sleeves are made from food-grade or medical-grade silicone.
This ensures that the sleeve is non-toxic and safe for contact with food, beverages, or skin.Look for certifications like FDA or LFGB to verify the safety standards of the silicone used. The absence of BPA, phthalates, and other harmful chemicals is also a critical factor to consider.

**Temperature Resistance:** Silicone's ability to withstand extreme temperatures sets it apart.
Excellent silicone sleeves should maintain their integrity and flexibility across a broad temperature range, typically from -40¬∞C to 230¬∞C (-40¬∞F to 446¬∞F). This feature makes them suitable for applications involving heat or cold, such as protecting hands from hot cookware or insulating beverages. Check the manufacturer's specifications for the precise temperature range the sleeve can handle.

**Thickness and Durability:** The thickness of a silicone sleeve directly correlates with its durability and protective capabilities.
thicker sleeves provide better insulation, impact resistance, and overall protection. Consider the intended use when selecting the appropriate thickness. For instance, a sleeve for a water bottle might require less thickness then a sleeve for protecting sensitive electronics. Reinforcements within the silicone structure, such as added layers or embedded fibers, can further enhance the sleeve's durability.

**Flexibility and Grip:** A good silicone sleeve should be flexible enough to easily stretch and conform to the shape of the object it's protecting.At the same time, it should provide a secure grip. The surface texture plays a crucial role in grip. A textured or slightly rough surface will offer better traction than a smooth surface, preventing slippage, especially when wet. The elasticity of the silicone determines how well it conforms to different shapes and sizes.

**Chemical Resistance:** Silicone exhibits good resistance to a variety of chemicals, but not all.
Check whether the silicone formulation has been designed to resist degradation when exposed to solvents, oils, or detergents depending on how the sleeve will be used. Sleeves used in healthcare or laboratory settings may require enhanced chemical resistance properties.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Practical considerations such as ease of cleaning contribute to user satisfaction.
look for sleeves that are dishwasher-safe or easily cleaned with soap and water.The non-porous nature of silicone generally prevents the absorption of odors or stains, making maintenance straightforward.

Key features of premium silicone sleeves include:

*   High-grade silicone construction
*   Wide temperature tolerance
*   Enhanced grip through textured surface
*   Chemical resistance
*   Dishwasher-safe design

## Core Benefits

Silicone sleeves provide distinct advantages over other protective materials due to their unique combination of properties.These benefits translate to improved functionality and user satisfaction in numerous applications.

**Enhanced Protection:** Silicone sleeves offer excellent protection against impacts, scratches, and thermal shock.
The shock-absorbing properties of silicone help safeguard fragile items from damage during drops or bumps. The sleeves also provide a barrier against abrasions, preventing scratches and scuffs. In thermal applications, they insulate against extreme temperatures, preventing burns or damage from heat or cold. For example, a silicone sleeve on a glass water bottle can prevent it from shattering if dropped, and protect the user's hand from extreme temperatures.

**Improved Grip and Handling:** The textured surface of silicone sleeves provides a secure grip, reducing the risk of slippage, especially when handling wet or slippery items.

This is particularly beneficial for items like water bottles, cookware, and tools. A secure grip can improve safety and prevent accidents. The sleeves enhance the user's ability to maintain control and manipulate objects with greater confidence. For example, a silicone sleeve on a kitchen knife can provide a more secure grip, reducing the risk of slipping and cutting oneself.

**Heat and Cold Resistance:** Silicone's ability to withstand extreme temperatures allows sleeves to be used in a variety of demanding applications.

They can protect hands from hot cookware, insulate beverages to maintain their temperature, and protect sensitive electronics from heat damage. This versatility makes silicone sleeves a valuable addition to kitchens,workshops,and outdoor settings. For example, using a silicone sleeve on a coffee cup can keep the contents hot for longer, while concurrently providing a agreeable grip and preventing burns.

**Increased Lifespan of Protected Items:** By providing a protective barrier, silicone sleeves can significantly extend the lifespan of the products they encase.

The sleeves prevent damage from impacts,scratches,and environmental factors,reducing the need for frequent replacements. This leads to long-term cost savings and reduces waste. For example, a silicone sleeve on a smartphone case protects the expensive device from cracks and dents, extending its useful life.

**Customization and aesthetics:** silicone sleeves are available in a wide variety of colors, shapes, and sizes, allowing for customization to match individual preferences or branding requirements.

They can also be molded into custom shapes to fit specific devices or products. This versatility allows brands to create unique and visually appealing products that stand out from the competition. For example, a company could brand water bottles with custom-colored and logo-imprinted silicone sleeves.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of cream and sugar hinges on several crucial features that impact taste, texture, and overall satisfaction.

**Cream Fat Content:** Cream's richness is directly tied to its fat content. Half-and-half, with a fat content between 10.5% and 18%, offers a lighter texture, while heavy cream, boasting over 36% fat, delivers a luxuriously thick and velvety consistency. The choice depends on the desired level of creaminess in your beverage.

**Sugar Granulation:** Sugar comes in various forms, each affecting dissolution and sweetness intensity. Granulated sugar, the most common type, dissolves readily in hot liquids. Caster sugar, with its finer crystals, dissolves even faster, making it ideal for delicate beverages. Powdered sugar, or confectioner's sugar, is often used for dusting and creating a smooth texture, but it may clump if directly added to hot liquids.

**Natural vs. Artificial Sweeteners:** The debate between natural and artificial sweeteners continues. Natural sweeteners like cane sugar, honey, and maple syrup offer distinct flavor profiles alongside their sweetness. Artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame and sucralose, provide intense sweetness with minimal calories, but some consumers are wary of their potential health effects. Stevia, a natural, zero-calorie sweetener derived from the stevia plant, is gaining popularity as a healthy alternative.

**Organic Certification:** For environmentally conscious consumers, organic certification is a significant factor. Organic cream and sugar are produced without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers, ensuring a cleaner and more sustainable product. Look for certifications from reputable organizations like the USDA to verify the organic status.

**Flavor Infusions:** Some cream and sugar products come with added flavor infusions, such as vanilla, hazelnut, or caramel. These infusions can add complexity and depth to your beverage, eliminating the need for separate flavorings. However, it's essential to check the ingredients list to ensure the flavorings are natural and of high quality.

**Packaging and Storage:** The packaging of cream and sugar plays a vital role in maintaining freshness and preventing spoilage. Cream should be stored in airtight containers in the refrigerator, while sugar should be kept in a cool, dry place to prevent clumping. Single-serving packets of cream and sugar offer convenience for on-the-go use and portion control.

Key features to consider when selecting cream and sugar include:
* Fat content in cream
* Sugar granulation and dissolution rate
* Natural vs. artificial sweeteners
* Organic certification
* Flavor infusions
* Packaging and storage considerations

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right cream and sugar offers several significant benefits, enhancing both the taste and overall experience of your beverages.

**Enhanced Flavor Profile:** The addition of cream and sugar can dramatically alter the flavor profile of coffee and tea, balancing bitterness and acidity. Cream adds a smooth, rich texture that complements the roasted notes of coffee, while sugar provides sweetness that enhances the overall taste. The right combination can create a harmonious and satisfying beverage.

**Improved Texture and Mouthfeel:** Cream contributes to a smoother and more luxurious mouthfeel, transforming a thin beverage into a velvety experience. The fat content in cream coats the palate, creating a sense of indulgence and satisfaction. Sugar, when properly dissolved, also contributes to a smoother texture, preventing a gritty or uneven sensation.

**Customizable Sweetness and Creaminess:** Cream and sugar allow you to customize the sweetness and creaminess of your beverage to your exact preferences. You can adjust the amount of each ingredient to achieve the perfect balance of flavor and texture. This level of control is particularly valuable for those with specific dietary needs or taste preferences.

**Increased Energy and Satisfaction:** The combination of caffeine and sugar can provide a quick energy boost, helping you stay alert and focused throughout the day. The addition of cream adds a sense of satiety, making your beverage more satisfying and preventing hunger pangs.

**Elevated Sensory Experience:** The act of adding cream and sugar to a beverage can be a ritualistic and enjoyable experience. The swirling of cream, the sprinkling of sugar, and the anticipation of the first sip all contribute to a heightened sensory experience that can elevate your mood and enhance your overall well-being.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about cream and sugar can help consumers make informed choices.

**What is the difference between heavy cream and light cream?**
Heavy cream has a fat content of 36% or higher, while light cream typically contains between 18% and 30% fat. Heavy cream is thicker and richer, making it ideal for whipping and creating decadent desserts. Light cream is lighter in texture and calories, suitable for coffee and other beverages where a less intense creaminess is desired.

**Can I use artificial sweeteners in place of sugar?**
Yes, artificial sweeteners can be used as a sugar substitute for those looking to reduce their calorie intake or manage blood sugar levels. However, it's important to be aware of the potential health effects associated with some artificial sweeteners and to choose them wisely. Stevia, a natural, zero-calorie sweetener, is a popular alternative.

**How should I store cream and sugar to maintain freshness?**
Cream should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator at a temperature below 40¬∞F (4¬∞C). Sugar should be stored in a cool, dry place in an airtight container to prevent clumping. Avoid exposing sugar to moisture or extreme temperatures.

**What are the benefits of using organic cream and sugar?**
Organic cream and sugar are produced without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers, ensuring a cleaner and more sustainable product. Organic farming practices also promote soil health and biodiversity. For environmentally conscious consumers, organic cream and sugar are a preferable choice.

I was 2 weeks sober before deciding I was ready for social connection again.

 well guess what I wasn't intentional about who my friends were and they were the type that goes out ALL the time; intially he asked for late night coffee at the pancake parlour and we had such a nice/deep convo until 5am. This was after our birthday (we are born same day), he went out to various pubs the night before drinking all night but I spent mine at home watching my fav movies and having hot chocolate. He said he doesn't do it all the time but from the hangover symptoms he was describing made me think otherwise (sounded like grey area drinking to binge drinking).

 Another warning sign he told me stories about how he's banned from a friends farm due to them being drunk and on adderral and destroying an expensive project at the time. 

At our next meetup it was a gig which was fun even though we both weren't drinking and it's the first time I've enjoyed a show sober and felt the same feelings if not better! That night went to shit because another friend got blackout and someone had to babysit but when she woke up she suggested we go to a bar nearby , everyone else thought it was a good idea and i was happy to tag along.

It got so bad I missed work the next day and the next week I just couldn't stop drinking. 

Eventually all the symptoms of fatigue, not wanting to do anything came back (this time I managed to hold down uni and work still). 

Well when I decided to cutback this week a little and then stopped completely on Wednesday, BOOM mild withdrawal symptoms came back day 1 then back pain and excessive vommiting for 3 days which I just knew is unusual so last night I checked in to hospital and they said it's a pancreatitis attack plus withdrawals üò≠

The modern patio cooler has evolved far beyond the simple insulated box. Today's models boast a wide range of features designed to maximize convenience, performance, and aesthetic appeal.

**Capacity:** This refers to the internal volume of the cooler, usually measured in quarts or cubic feet.Consider the size of your typical gatherings when choosing a capacity.

# Sencha green Tea: Best brands & 2025 Buyer's Guide

Sencha green tea is one of the most popular types of Japanese green tea, known for its refreshing flavor and vibrant green color. This unfermented tea is steamed, rolled, and dried, which preserves its natural antioxidants and delivers a distinct taste that ranges from grassy and vegetal to subtly sweet.With a growing consumer focus on health and wellness,sencha has become a staple in many tea drinkers' routines. This buyer‚Äôs guide will explore the key aspects of sencha, recommend top brands, and provide insights to help you make an informed decision in 2025.

[[Explore Top Rated sencha green tea on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=sencha green tea)

## Key Features Analysis

Sencha green tea‚Äôs quality is persistent by several factors including processing method, leaf grade, and origin.Understanding these features can help you assess the tea's value and suitability for your taste.

**Steaming Process:** The steaming process is crucial in defining sencha‚Äôs character. Deep-steamed (fukamushi) sencha undergoes a longer steaming period, resulting in a smoother, less astringent flavor and a darker green color. lightly steamed (asamushi) sencha retains a more vibrant green color and delivers a more pronounced grassy flavor. The steaming time directly impacts the final taste and appearance of the tea leaves.

the duration of the steaming process impacts the enzyme activity within the tea leaves, halting oxidation and preserving chlorophyll. Fukamushi sencha, for instance, due to extended steaming, may have a slightly cloudier appearance when brewed as the leaves break down further.

**Leaf Grade:** The quality of sencha is also heavily influenced by the grade of tea leaves used. Shincha, or ""new tea,"" harvested during the first flush of spring, boasts a delicate sweetness and minimal bitterness. Lower grades might include larger, coarser leaves, leading to a less refined flavor profile. Premium grades consist of fine, needle-like leaves that brew into a brighter, more flavorful cup.

Leaf size and uniformity indicate the quality of processing and the selection of young, tender leaves.Higher grades often feature unbroken leaves, demonstrating careful handling during harvesting and processing, while lower grades may consist of broken or fragmented leaves.

**Origin:** The region where sencha is grown considerably impacts its flavor profile. Shizuoka, Uji, and Kagoshima are renowned tea-producing regions in Japan, each offering unique characteristics. Sencha from Shizuoka is often balanced with both grassy and umami notes. Uji sencha is prized for its refined sweetness and smooth texture. Kagoshima sencha tends to be bolder with a slightly astringent finish.

The soil composition, climate, and elevation of these regions contribute to the distinct terpene profiles and amino acid content of the sencha. Knowledge of the tea's origin enables consumers to anticipate particular flavor nuances and make informed purchasing decisions.

**Harvest Season:** The timing of the harvest greatly affects the quality and flavor of sencha. First flush (shincha) is harvested in the spring and considered the highest quality, offering a delicate sweetness and smooth mouthfeel.Second and third flush harvests occur later in the year and tend to have a more robust and slightly bitter flavor. Understanding the harvest season helps consumers choose sencha with the desired flavor profile.

First flush sencha leaves are typically rich in L-theanine, an amino acid known to promote relaxation and focus, and lower in catechins, which contribute to bitterness. This unique chemical composition translates to a smoother, sweeter flavor prized by tea connoisseurs.

Key features of premium sencha include:

* Bright green color
* Needle-like leaf shape
* Fresh, grassy aroma
* Balanced flavor - Umami and slight sweetness
* Smooth mouthfeel

## Core Benefits

Sencha green tea offers a multitude of benefits beyond its delightful taste, making it a popular choice for health-conscious individuals.

**Antioxidant Richness:** Sencha is packed with polyphenols, particularly catechins, which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds help combat free radicals in the body,reducing oxidative stress and potentially lowering the risk of chronic diseases.

These antioxidants work to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals, contributing to overall health and well-being.Regular consumption of sencha, therefore, may support a healthy immune system and contribute to long-term wellness.

**Improved Focus and Alertness:** Sencha contains both caffeine and L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation without causing drowsiness. The combination of these compounds provides a balanced energy boost, enhancing focus and mental clarity.

Unlike the jitters associated with coffee, the L-theanine in sencha moderates the effects of caffeine, resulting in a calm alertness suitable for prolonged concentration.This makes sencha a favored choice for individuals seeking a cognitive boost without the adverse effects of other caffeinated beverages.

**Heart Health Support:** Regular consumption of green tea, including sencha, has been linked to improved cardiovascular health. The antioxidants in sencha help reduce LDL cholesterol levels and improve blood vessel function, potentially lowering the risk of heart disease.

Studies suggest that the flavanols in sencha contribute to endothelial function,supporting healthy blood flow and reducing the risk of blood clot formation. This preventive action makes sencha a valuable addition to a heart-healthy lifestyle.

**Weight Management:** sencha may aid in weight management due to its metabolism-boosting properties. The catechins in sencha have been shown to increase fat oxidation and improve insulin sensitivity, potentially supporting weight loss efforts.

While not a magic bullet, sencha can complement a balanced diet and exercise regimen by potentially increasing calorie expenditure and promoting fat breakdown. Including sencha as part of a holistic approach to weight management may yield positive results.

1l4jmuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1l4jmuq/belated_trip_report_winter_2024/,Belated Trip Report: Winter 2024,"We were in Paris last winter (2024) and I used this subreddit to gather information. In order to return the favor, I wrote up some highlights and tips that worked for us. We are a couple in our 60s from California who enjoy history, art, food, architecture and observing and learning from different cultures.



Our best times in Paris were spent just randomly walking around different parts of the city with no real goal other than exploring. There is so much to see. My main suggestion is do not try to pack too many activities in a day. Even if you think you will never come back, cut something out so you can just stroll or have a long, leisurely lunch or simply sit at a caf√© and people watch. In my opinion, that's where the magic of Paris lies.¬†



These are some highlights and observations, in no particular order.



**Bookstores:** The first inkling of how different French people and Americans are is that there were so many bookstores everywhere. Big bookstores and small ones. General books and specialized bookstores. The French are a clearly literate people who value reading. I loved it.¬†



**Montmartre:** We walked from our hotel there twice, both times early in the morning. The first time it was already light, so it was about 8 a.m. There were hardly any tourists and there were great views of quiet streets, beautiful homes, and at the top sweeping views of Paris. I chose a route that brought us to the church from the back instead of walking up the steps. It was dramatic to walk behind the church, turn a corner and then see all of Paris.



The second time, we walked there even earlier in order to get to 7:30 Mass at Sacre-Coeur. This time the streets were still dark as dawn was breaking. That walk was magical. The play between the lights and the empty streets, hearing only our footsteps was one of our highlights. At Mass, there were only a handful of people. We had breakfast at a little restaurant right on Place du Tertre. There was hardly anyone in that square; the artists were just barely arriving to set up as we were leaving. I've seen many pictures and videos of that square literally packed with people. We had it almost to ourselves. This second time I chose a route that took us up the neighborhoods.



Afterwards, we finally walked down the steps as all the tourists were trekking up. Please don't put a padlock on the fence; it ruins the fence.



**Tomb of Dalida:** Dalida was a beloved chanteuse whose career spanned from the 1950s to the 1980s. Born in Egypt to Italian parents, she moved to France where she had a loyal following. Her life was beset with tragedy. Her tomb is in Montmartre Cemetery is extraordinary. We went there on our way up the hill.



What was most surprising is that, even though she died in 1987, there were multiple bouquets of fresh cut flowers for her. Her bust in Montmartre is in Place de Dalida so named because she lived in Montmartre where she was considered a distinguished local citizen. People love to rub her ample bosom on that bust. I wonder what she would think of that.¬†



**Peruvian restaurant:** I am of Peruvian origin so I have a ritual of always seeking out some Peruvian food wherever I go. We went to Paris' oldest Peruvian restaurant for a late lunch, El Picaflor, at 9 Rue Lac√©pede near the Grande Mosqu√©e. The food was very good, very fresh, and well-prepared.



The ceviche and aj√≠ de gallina were the standouts. I also enjoyed talking with the server when we ended up being the only patrons left. The whole vibe was different from the formality of French restaurants. We shared stories, laughed and just had that more casual and friendly interaction like we're used to in the Americas.



**Immigration Museum:** The Mus√©e nationale de l'histoire d'immigration is in the 12th arrondissement near the Peripherique and Porte Dor√©e. We took a bus from St Germain-des-Pr√©s to get there which took us past many other Paris landmarks. This museum was high on my list and did not disappoint. It is housed inside the Palais Dor√©e which was built in 1931 as part of the Paris Colonial Exhibition, which was a type of world fair to highlight all of France's colonies around the world and how great it was that France was a unifying power to so many disparate people.



The building is decorated in bas-relief images of the colonies and inside there are frescos and one room that is completely covered in murals depicting the four regions of the world where France had colonies, French values and the ""natives"". The exhibit is very complete and starts with immigration to France from the late 1700s to the present day. We loved this, although many of the exhibits were in French only. Great videos, photos and artifacts. When we left, we didn't realize the Chateau de Vincennes was not very far away. It's a castle from the 1300s.



**Louvre:** We booked tickets at the opening time for two consecutive days. I divided the collection into two parts: Antiquities and European Masters. The first day we only saw works from ancient times: Etruscans, Egyptians, Roman, Greek, Persian and so on.



The second day we returned to see everything else. It's crowded, busy and many people are only there to see the highlights. Breaking it up worked very well for us since we knew a lot about what we were looking at. We loved the Louvre. We entered via the Carrousel entrance on Rue de Rivoli.



**Seafood:** I love all seafood. We were there at the same time as my brother- and sister-in-law. She and I both celebrate our birthdays in December so our spouses took us out to eat. We went to Comptoir des Mers at 1 Rue de Turenne, off Rue de Rivoli and near Metro Saint-Paul. It was a long, excellent and expensive meal but worth every euro.



We had one of the towers of fruits de mer, lots of extra oysters and two or three bottles of champagne and wines. This is not the type of meal I would have often, but it was definitely memorable. They do serve other dishes that are not as costly. Service there was excellent. There was great seafood all over town.



**Carnavalet:** We loved this museum. When we were there, there was an exhibit about the Terror, the period of time right after the Revolution. Not only was it fascinating, but I noticed how interested the French visitors were. They would read everything posted and stand around and discuss the exhibits. I think we were the only non-French there. The exhibit about the history of Paris was also very good as was sitting out in the gardens despite it being cold and wintry.



**La D√©fense:** We headed out to La D√©fense because it had one of the biggest Christmas markets. It was packed full of people but we loved it. Standing beneath the Grande Arche makes you realize how massive that building is. Surprisingly, we also liked walking around the mall and just seeing all the different types of people who live in Paris.¬†



**Hotels:** We stayed in two different hotels during our time in order to experience two different neighborhoods. Our first hotel was the Alize Montmartre in Place de Clichy. Definitely not fancy but perfectly acceptable. Place de Clichy is well-connected by Metro and bus. It's always bustling and there are caf√©s and restaurants to sit and people watch. It's close to Montmartre and the Marais. Staff was friendly and helpful. There is a supermarket right beneath. We liked the location and staff so much, we're going to stay there at the beginning of our next trip next winter.¬†



After about six days, for the final¬† five days, we moved to the Grand Hotel des Balcons in Saint-Germain-de-Pr√©s a half-block from Theatre Odeon. Much larger room, more modern, friendly staff. Excellent location. The neighborhood was completely different from Place de Clichy. We really liked staying in two different parts of Paris.



**Le Wepler:** Just a quick shout out to this traditional brasserie in Place de Clichy. It was the first place we ate after checking into our hotel. We ended up there many times, for a coffee, dessert or meal. And, we had a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner there. Nothing too over the top, just a solid place with very good service and a lot of atmosphere.¬†



**Transportation:** We used a combination of Metro, buses, G7 taxis and Uber. It just depended where we were going and how fast we needed to get there. I did prefer the bus to the Metro because they're so easy to use and there is so much to see. We took a taxi to and from CDG. We didn't want to deal with luggage on a train.

For instance, I can often find conventionally grown apples for around $2/lb, whereas the organic, locally-sourced ones might be $4 or even $5/lb. I want to support sustainable agriculture, but that price difference can be really notable, especially when you're buying groceries for a family.It feels like I'm constantly weighing the immediate financial impact against the long-term environmental costs. It's not just with produce,either. Buying in bulk *can* be more economical and reduce packaging, but the initial outlay is higher. Then there's the question of fair trade versus cheaper, non-fair trade products like coffee or chocolate.

Does anyone else struggle with this, or have any tips for making more sustainable choices without breaking the bank? I'm genuinely curious to hear how others are navigating this dilemma.

1l4ji9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Behcets/comments/1l4ji9t/possible_cause_and_treatment/,Possible Cause and Treatment,"I am excited to share what I believe are groundbreaking findings. ALL things line up and my many rabbit holes I‚Äôve gone down have finally connected. This may not apply to all and I don‚Äôt expect to have solved the worlds issues BUT I believe this may help many of us.

Firstly, I‚Äôve become a closet research scientist and geneticist and have garnished insights from people‚Äôs genetics who had similar symptoms and issues with their health. 

Next, I did multiple trials on myself the most recent one which made me severely ill (an intended outcome). The long winding road is complex but this is my health issue and fix. 

It seems in the body there are two paths to lower oxidative stress through the creation of glutathione. One pathway which enlists the help of a solute carrier gene (SLC25a38) and connects to ALAS2 gene is also responsible for folate and B6 transport. This particular gene is also responsible for carrying glycine to the mitochondria (I react severely to glycine). Whilst there is limited research on this gene, there are articles that point to its links to all cause cancer both leukemia and tumors. It is also associated with congenital sideroblastic anaemia, Marfan syndrome, porphyria, Charcot Marie tooth disease and osteo issues. I am confirmed to have a susceptibility to lead poisoning in ALAS2 which is summise is due to disrupted glycine metabolism due to SLC25a38. I have also confirmed I have a folate trap (likely due to the congenital sideroblastic anaemia). Others I have spoken to are unknown if these genes are an issue but genes within this pathway are defective which leads to glutathione deficiency. 

Now‚Ä¶. This is where is gets really interesting‚Ä¶ IF the above pathway is defective, there is another way the body can produce glutathione which involves the introduction of certain substances. This pathway is part of the CYP450 enzyme family or more specifically CYP2e1. If you take ‚Äúinducers‚Äù and these inducers are nicotene, benzene, hard cheeses, fatty fish and red meats, butter, ethanol, heavy cream, colchicine (gout medication) this helps the body produce glutathione which in turn detoxes the liver.  Ethanol however is a double edged sword as it is also a substrate which is bad. 

KEY POINT here is Colchicine is a Cyp2e1 treatment for behcets and it is a cyp2e1 INDUCER.

So to lay this out‚Ä¶ hypothetically if your issue is somewhere in this genetic pathway which supports glutathione production, then you MUST induce the CYP2e1 pathway. If you inhibit CYP2e1 then you will have no way for your body to eliminate oxidative stress which leads to severe abdominal pain, bloat, a strangling sensation of the small intestine, vomiting and in some circumstances diarrhea and of course vitamin malabsorption. Not to mention worsening anaemia due to oxidative stress. In this scenario, there is a deficiency in B12 (due to anti parietal cells and normal MMA), a functional folate deficit (folate trap) and B6 anaemia which can present as very high B6. Basically a trifecta of anaemia and additionally vitamin D deficiency as vitamin D requires folate, magnesium and other B vitamins. 

So what foods and or medication ‚Äúinhibit‚Äù Cyp2e1 (this is by no means an exhaustive list please do your own research) -
Foods that contain bergamottin:
Citrus fruits:
Grapefruit
Limes
Seville oranges
Pomelo
Bergamot (Citrus bergamia)
Other foods:
Celery
Parsnips

Salicylic acid (an excipient in many medications)
Garlic
Soya Sauce
Seed oils
Eggs
Black tea / green tea
Polyethylene Glycol (in many medications and vaccines)
Propofol
Bromazepam
Fruits and vegetables high in salicylates such as tomatoes and cucumbers. 
Polyphenols also seem to inhibit (coffee, blackberries) - although I hate to give up coffee so instead have added heavy cream to try to offset the effects. 

What foods / other stuff induce Cyp2e1
Nicotene (I believe this is why long covid sufferers have success with nicotene gum, sprays or patches) - I have run a test and the gum is the most successful
Fatty fish like salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel, prawns
Omega 3 (everyone knows omega 3 detoxes the body I believe it is because it is an inducer)
Fatty meats lamb, steak etc
Ethanol (but a double edged sword)
Hard cheeses
Heavy cream 
Butter
Ascorbic acid
‚Ä¶ similar to the carnivore and/or keto but you can add vegetables such as carrots or potatoes and white rice as I can‚Äôt find evidence they either induce or inhibit hence are safe. 

When you induce cyp2e1, in theory you increase production of glutathione and detox the liver and lower oxidative stress. I know it sounds completely bizarre that nicotene is a detox but I have also found evidence that nicotene increases cyp enzymes which has been scientifically shown to reduce the risk of Parkinson‚Äôs. - you can find these articles by searching google. Note the keto/carnivore style diet is also high in riboflavin and B6 which is believe supports the reduction in anaemia. Key point however is the absolute must to ensure you have FAT and lots of it. 

A few nights ago I put my theory to the test. So off I went to a Chinese restaurant and loaded up on garlic soya sauce foods for a few hours.. within a few hours of returning home, my ankles blew up into balloons, I was leaning over the big white toilet, my heart rate rocketed and I had the usual intense abdominal pain. The inhibitors did what I expected them to do.. so the next day to recover I started chewing nicotene gum, ate some salmon and had some heavy cream in my coffee (coffee should in theory be avoided) with sugar as yes sugar also helps me. Within minutes of adding the inducers my heartrate went from 100 back down to 75-80 my normal range. 

So now for my wild theory‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never had Covid.. I believe it‚Äôs because i naturally lean towards foods that are inducers of cyp2e1 (I have avoided fruit most of my life).. BUT I also found research articles that benzene is proven to have antiviral properties in mouse models. Yes I am a smoker‚Ä¶. Benzene is also an inducer and is part of glutathione production via the cyp2e1 pathway. But I‚Äôm not advocating you all start smoking coz cigarettes also contain other bad sh.t. But for those that recognise foods you have issues with on the inhibitor list.. you may want to try nicotene gum as a rescue when you get yourself into a bad situation similar to my soya sauce challenge. I also have success with the age old Kiwi tradition of quickeze aka magnesium carbonate. 

Allergies I do not believe are ‚Äúallergies‚Äù but are instead our bodies inability to reduce oxidative stress due to a genetic polymorphism which impacts our glutathione production. The path to health is identifying and correlating the things that make you unwell with the things that make you feel good. It‚Äôs taking me close to two years after going down hundreds of rabbit holes to find a picture that completely fits all my health issues and I NOW know what foods to avoid and can make the lifestyle changes for good health. Once my vitamin levels normalise with the restricted diet approach I have no doubt my anaemia will resolve and I will be able to occasionally have the bad stuff. For now I feel I‚Äôve scientifically explained why nicotene provides relief for those with long covid. I have requested a custom gene panel at Mayo targeting 14 genes to validate my theory. Below are the genes if anyone else would like to do the same and assess your own polymorphisms. 

Genes 

GSTM1 
GSTP1 
GSTT1
NAT2
Glyt1
Glut1
DAS (yeast)
DAS1
GBF1
CYP2e1
NM_016725.3 (FOLR)
NM_017875.4 (SLC25A38)

For now, that‚Äôs a wrap and I hope I didn‚Äôt bore you with my closet science from the non scientist but instead a fellow sufferer who has read close to 100,000 research papers and ran all sorts of crazy random diet and health challenges to get to this answer üòÇ",5,1749183683.0,Behcets,3,0.86,False

We headed back to my place and we basically just watched a movie and cuddled, the whole date was pretty PG but then in the morning when her friend called her, she wouldn't wake up so I picked up the phone for her and she screamed her name. I recognized it instantly because it wasn't a very common name for girls and I confirmed her last name too. I know this may sound stupid but we were mortal enemies in third grade. Don't ask me why, she hated my guts the second she saw me and I hated her because she hated me. And her hatred was so intense I was scared she'd still hold a grudge so then that morning I told her that we can't be doing this and I didn't want to be with her. I may have said a few more things that hurt her even more and I truly regret that now. I was just so scared that if she found out my name then we couldn't be what I hoped we'd become.
