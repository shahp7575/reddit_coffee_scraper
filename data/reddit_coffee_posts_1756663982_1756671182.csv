I thought my roommate spilled coffee but it was a weird place because it was under the rim of the cabinet. There are no signs of grossness within or on the outside and apparently my roommate cleaned some up earlier because she thought i spilled coffee. On the picture you can see kind of goey stuff coming from in between the board. For the life of me i can’t figure out where it is coming from and what is causing it. It has no distinct smell.

1n54pu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1n54pu2/evaluate_best_electric_kettle_fellow_corvo_ekg/,Evaluate best electric kettle Fellow Corvo EKG Pro and is it worth it,"Using the Fellow 1171PRO-MB electric kettle has become a routine fixture in my daily coffee and tea rituals. As a self-proclaimed hot beverage enthusiast, I immediately found this product's sophisticated design and robust features intriguing from the get-go. Its sleek matte black finish, ergonomic handle, and compact dimensions make it feel more like a piece of art than just an appliance sitting on my kitchen counter. The modern aesthetics blend seamlessly into my space without overpowering the decor, which is certainly a pleasant bonus.

**Precision Heating and Controls**  
What surprised me most is how easy it is to control the water temperature down to a single degree. The built-in high-resolution LCD interface feels like something you'd find on a high-tech gadget, allowing you to schedule boils, toggle hold mode, and even adjust other settings like chime volume. With the ability to set the kettle for anywhere from a gentle 180°F for my green tea to a robust 205°F for French press coffee, this device ensures the perfect brew every time. It’s almost become a game of experimentation, narrowing down the precise temperature that works best for specific tea types.

**Effortless and Comfortable Pouring**  
The spout design is another feature that stood out from day one. I’ve used other kettles that leave you guessing how fast or slow the water will pour out. With this electric kettle, the wide spout delivers a smooth, controlled pour, and the ergonomic handle makes the entire process feel comfortable and precise. Whether pouring a single cup or managing multiple cups during a family breakfast, I never experienced spillage or awkward wrist movements.  

[Check Fellow 1171PRO-MB price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b0bz59157h/)  

**Tailored Brewing as You Like It**  
There’s something about the customization options that make this kettle a standout. The Guide Mode simplifies life by offering preset temperature settings for various teas and coffee brewing methods. The Brew Stopwatch is another feature I frequently use because it truly takes the guesswork out of brew timing. With these features, everything about the brewing process feels intentional and professional. My sister, who’s new to luxury kitchen gadgets, recently visited and was amazed at how user-friendly yet advanced the kettle was to use.  

**Strengths**  
- Effortless precision due to to-the-degree temperature control  
- Modern design with a matte finish and intuitive LCD screen  
- Brew Guide Mode and stopwatch enhance control over brewing  
- Ergonomic handle provides comfort for extended pouring  
- WiFi firmware updates keep the device up-to-date  

**Hurdles**  
- Higher price range compared to simpler kettles  
- Frequent manual cleaning required due to mineral deposits  
- The device isn’t dishwasher-safe, which might deter some  

**Built to Last**  
The high-quality build of this kettle gives me confidence that it’s not just a fleeting investment. The body is made from 304 stainless steel, known for its durability and resistance to rusting, while the BPA-free silicone used for exterior components ensures safety. For someone who values the longevity of kitchen tools, it's reassuring to see these thoughtful material choices. However, like all electric kettles, you’ll notice some mineral deposits forming over time that require cleaning. Admittedly, this is expected with regular use of any kettle, but it's worth mentioning for those who’d prefer a more hands-off approach.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing this electric kettle to competitors, several products come to mind, such as the Breville Smart Kettle Luxe and the Cuisinart PerfecTemp variable kettle. Both offer precise temperature control, but they’re bulkier and lack the focused design precision you get here. The Breville, while well-made, doesn't feel as customizable in its interface, and the Cuisinart falls short with fewer design-forward elements. If aesthetics and compactness are essential, this kettle emerges as the clear winner. However, if you’re strictly seeking functionality without additional frills, there’s potential savings with other models that meet basic brewing needs.  

**Value Proposition**  
Though this kettle sits at a premium price point, its value becomes evident the more you use it. It's perfect for someone who enjoys savoring precise flavors in their tea or coffee but also doesn’t want to compromise on design or functionality. Compared to less expensive models, the added nuance and durability feel worth the extra expense. For those willing to invest in their everyday beverage experience, it’s a purchase that feels both practical and indulgent.

1n54pel,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1n54pel/nonssri_options/,Non-SSRI options?,"I think SSRIs are just not for me. The irritability I feel for those few days is being totally dwarfed by the side effects of the meds (Lexapro). Haven't been able to sleep a full night for a month even on a low dose, I'm more depressed than I have ever been in my life and can't get anything done, I can't regulate my temperature at all and I'm always cold, I passed out yesterday because I have no appetite and didn't realize I was starving, and my skin feels like it's burning a few hours after taking it every day. I have tried switching when I take it, taking half in the AM and half at night, taking with food, no coffee, extra coffee, etc. 

  
And this is a mild reaction compared to Prozac (violently ill) or Zoloft (allergic). 

  
I also can't take estrogen BC since I have migraines with aura and those are completely debilitating, too. 

  
I have a wearable that tracks my cycles based on temperature, and this is in addition to my Stardust tracker. It's been *on the money* accurate for months now, and I feel like I'm really getting good at identifying exactly when luteal starts. If I can preemptively cut out caffeine (or reduce it from coffee to green tea) and isolate a bit during that time, maybe I'll be ok and won't harm any of my relationships?

Work and studies have taken me across five countries, and while I love exploring, I’m now ready to build a cozy home —with the right person.

I’d love to meet someone in their 30s or 40s who’s who’s established in their own life and also ready for a life partner, a forever connection

I’m a deeply feeling introvert who spends a lot of time on health, fitness (yes, I’m a bit of a fanatic and proud of being in great shape), nutrition, and spirituality-lately learning more about Advaita. I throw myself into the things I care about, whether that’s work, friendships, or simply living everyday life with intention. I’m equally comfortable debating world affairs, swapping travel stories, or laughing over something completely silly.

I also know that two people coming together to build a life isn’t easy. What makes it work, I believe, are respect, trust, and a lasting friendship to carry you through the tougher parts.

Who I imagine you to be:

* You laugh easily, say funny things, and love when I do the same.
* You are my BFF and do not roll your eyes when I use the term BFF.
* You are damn smart – but not a snob about it. You are in love with life. Family comes first. 
* You do not mistake my warmth, love, and affection for weakness.
* You do what you love. You make the best of any situation.
* You share your chips with me. You will come with me for walks. 
* You love hard, fight fair, and balance modern independence with a touch of old-school kindness.
* Compassion and generosity guide your choices, and you always try to see the best in people.

Simply put, you inspire me and are inspired by me. That’s the kind of bond I’m looking for—one that’s deep and supportive, but also light-hearted and adventurous.

**So what say - shall we travel, smash patriarchy, cook healthy, work out often, make memories, and open our hearts and minds?**

1n54mzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1n54mzm/i_started_hitchhiking_out_of_curiosity/,I started hitchhiking out of curiosity.,"I’d fill my backpack with clothes, deodorant, and toiletries, never taking anything I was afraid to lose, but taking a few dollars just in case. Most people were happy to take me along, talking about my haphazard traveling like old buddies. Safety was never a concern.

That is, until I was robbed. I had fallen asleep, but since I wasn’t going anywhere in particular, he kept driving. When I finally woke up, he stopped the car and wouldn’t leave until I got out. Before he left, he rummaged through my pack, taking my used deodorant, returning the hundred dollars I had carefully wrapped around it.

I gaped, watching him back out all the way to the next road. Staring at trees I didn’t recognize, I ultimately decided all I could do was walk. Robins sang their late morning songs, cheering me up in the near-silent isolation.

The dirt path led me to a rickety mansion of jagged wood and a paint stripped rocking chair sitting on an uneven porch. A grey-haired woman beckoned me in from a shattered window. Without saying a word, she took me in and gave me a bowl full of steaming beef stew, which I ate despite my better judgment. The stew smelled heavily of my mom’s home before she died. I asked the woman what I could do in exchange, and she pointed at her full trashcan and dishes. After doing her bidding, she brought me to a room with a neatly put together bed, then shambled off to her own room.

I nearly left, because she still hadn’t spoken, and we didn’t know each other’s names. But I didn’t want to pass up the elderly hospitality, especially after being abandoned on the road. I woke up to the smell of coffee while the morning rays beamed warmth through her flimsy curtains. She gave me a ragged towel, pointing towards the bathroom. It had no soap, and the water was cold, but I cleaned myself regardless.

Somewhat refreshed, I walked down to her kitchen, where she silently greeted me with a plate full of pancakes and a newspaper, which I graciously accepted. I spent some time reading, but right after the first comic, she wrote down: you’re welcome into the silent city

Confused, I looked into her eyes for the first time. They were old. Older than her wrinkly face suggested. The air felt thicker than the syrup I just ate. She brought me to her back door with unreasonable strength and pushed me out onto a hidden road behind her house. Croaking, she said, “Don’t speak” as I stumbled to the ground. Instantly I thought: “Why didn’t she speak the whole time?” I immediately took her order. Something about her demand made it instinctual, like I had to obey for my own safety.

Logically, I knew that running away would make sense, but now I was curious. The cheerful robins from before were eerily quiet. Under her questioning stare, I slowly walked forward.",1,1756670809.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False
1n54lcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1n54lcr/are_there_unconventional_scents_from_american/,Are there unconventional scents from American houses that you've fell in love?,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1n3s0w5/comment/nbfxq6l/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1n3s0w5/comment/nbfxq6l/) 

I asked this question in the daily discussion yesterday, but I realized I would love to hear from a wider audience, so I am posting again here.

I am trying to explore as many American fragrance houses as I can while I am still in the States, although I do need to stay within a budget. I started by ordering discovery sets, but some brands do not offer them or the price is out of reach.

So far I have tried discovery sets from **Rogue** and **Chatillon Lux**. I also placed orders with **Imaginary Authors** and **FZOTIC** and those should arrive in the next few days. I will try to share how they were if time allows it.

I would love to expand into more houses, but right now I can really only afford to buy one or two samples at a time rather than full sets.

That is why I am asking for recommendations. I am especially interested in distinctive scents that stand apart from the usual mainstream options. I am often drawn to cypress, woody and peppery notes, but I am very open to anything unusual or unconventional. If you know of an American fragrance that showcases a truly unique or unexpected combination, I would be grateful to hear about it. And if there is an indie scent that completely mesmerizes you regardless of my preferences, please share it.

For context, I will be traveling to Manhattan soon, so I will also get the chance to stop by Scent Bar and explore New York based houses + more.

The houses(scents) I’m planning to try out in person are: 

DS & DURGA (Big Sur Eucalyptus, Mississippi Medicine)  
Kerosene (Unknown Pleasures, Winter of '99)  
Scents of Wood (Plum in Cognac)  
House of Bo (Espiritu)  
Zoologist (Squid, Sacred Scarab)  
Ranger Station,  
Aedes Perfumery

Other houses(scents) on my radar:

For context, he and I met while I was in an open relationship but the relationship was falling apart. I opened it up to try and save it but I was in denial that it’s been over for months. I did not expect to meet someone like this let alone have such a deep connection. I was struggling with my relationship bc we were long distance but there was rarely any communication, he wouldn’t inquire about me, I felt forgotten about and then suddenly I meet this guy who’s everything I’ve been begging my bf to be and more. He made me a playlist with every single band I’ve mentioned to him and even arranged the first four songs to spell out my name. I’ve never had someone do something like that for me. He even sent me a song he had on repeat and said he listened to it with thoughts of me. He stopped speaking to me bc he knew he was getting attached but knew he couldn’t have me. I understood. But a day and a half passed and I had to come to terms with the fact that my relationship is over but also, I owed it to myself to get to know this person at least as a friend first. So I reached out and he let me have a conversation on the phone with him and I explained everything and we started talking again.

I broke up with my boyfriend a couple days later and it was a very mature, not messy break up. Of course it’s still painful but deep down I’ve known it was over for a while.

But then he opened up to me about an unfortunate situation from his past and told me he has a tendency to ghost when he feels he’s getting attached. Well surprise surprise, he ghosted me.

It's about time I bust out of this self-imposed shell and meet new people both online and IRL!

I honestly don't know how to describe myself other than I'm a bit of a homebody who wants a relaxed existence and enjoys the simple things in life (hiking, exploring coffee shops, etc), so here's a list of random facts about me:

-Every day after work, I take my Staffy mix dog to a wooded park along the Mississippi River to let her run to her heart's content. 

-I'm the most over-educated blue collar guy you'll ever meet. After working in biomedicine for 13 years, having a PhD in a biomedical field (yes, I'm technically a doctor), and a failed stint in the private sector, I started my own lawn care business that's growing faster than I ever thought it would!

-Most people would consider my hobbies to be complete opposites. I'm a Trekkie, DnD fan, and I want to get back into cosplay. At the same time, I like tinkering with small engines, restoring lawn mowers, and looking up how to get better lawn stripes with my zero-turn mower.

-Favorite TV shows include Supernatural, Wednesday, Suits, Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul, Star Trek TNG (trying to start DS9, but that first season is just terrible), Beastars, Avatar, Stranger Things, and Inside Job. Also, The Orville is my favorite Star Trek series 🤣

-I'm a guy with long-hair, guess what my favorite music genre is?

-I will talk your ear off about world mythology. My favorite is Aztec. 

-As far as what I look like, [here are some photos of me](https://imgur.com/a/XqqTndC)

*Green flags:*

-I've been to therapy and I want to go again. I think it's given me plenty of emotional intelligence and good communication skills

-I think I'm empathetic, even to a fault. When I'm out at work or running errands, I get anxious about leaving my dog at home. I think I may have more separation anxiety than her 😅

-I pay close attention to my health. Last year, I lost 60lbs during my weight loss journey, and I've managed to keep it off over a year later!

-I love dogs! I plan to have a few acres in the future and have as many dogs as I (legally) can!

*Possible deal breakers:*

-I'm 5'6. However, I don't care if you're shorter or taller than me

-I'm child-free. Not that I hate children; I just don't see myself being a father. I plan to get a vasectomy by the end of this year

-I have debts, but I'm slowly working on them and on my credit score. 

-I have a ""high body count"" due to wanting to explore in college. However, I tried to be as ethical about it as possible; I always used protection, I never got involved with people in monogamous relationships, and I never tried to be deceitful about it.

-I'm pansexual/demisexual. I don't think it's a dealbreaker, but I've been rejected before because of it.

*What I'm looking for in terms of relationships:* 

-Honestly, I would like a friendship that will eventually turn romantic. If not, I at least hope to make some lasting friendships!

-Physically, as long as you're at least height-weight proportionate, you're good.

1n54fad,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarsShots/comments/1n54fad/do_meme_coins_need_realworld_utility_to_survive_a/,Do Meme Coins Need Real-World Utility to Survive? A Deep Dive,"Over the past few years, the crypto space has exploded with meme coins. From Dogecoin to Shiba Inu, and more recently countless Solana and Ethereum-based projects, memes have become a driving force of community, hype, and speculation. But here’s the question I’ve been thinking about:

👉 Can meme coins actually last if they don’t have any real-world use case?

This isn’t financial advice, just a discussion point that I think the community should explore. Let’s dive in.

⸻

🌍 The Meme Coin Phenomenon

Meme coins started almost as a joke. Dogecoin was literally created to poke fun at Bitcoin. Shiba Inu came later as the “Dogecoin killer,” and both exploded not because of groundbreaking tech, but because of culture, community, and hype cycles.

These projects proved that in crypto, narrative often beats fundamentals. The meme is the message – and the meme spreads faster than any whitepaper.

But… here’s the issue: most meme coins don’t last. The hype dies, the community moves on, and the bagholders are left behind.

So what separates a meme coin that goes to zero from one that has staying power?

⸻

💸 Scarcity vs. Utility

Most meme coins play the scarcity game. Huge supplies (like trillions of tokens) make them “cheap,” but they rely on people buying in just for the chance of 100x. Scarcity can create hype, but it doesn’t always create long-term value.

On the other hand, utility gives a project a reason to exist beyond hype. If a token can actually be used for something, then it potentially builds staying power.

That brings me to an interesting example I recently stumbled across:

⸻

🕶️ Example: Gangster Pepe Pay ($GPEPAY)

I’ll use this project as a case study. Not shilling, just analyzing.
	•	Supply: Only 69 million tokens (compared to trillions in other meme coins). This gives it a “scarcity premium.”
	•	Chain: Built on Solana, which means fast and cheap transactions. Perfect for micropayments.
	•	Vision: Instead of being “just another meme,” the project is pushing towards being an actual payment coin – targeting coffeeshops, headshops, and lifestyle shops.

Now, whether or not they succeed is another question. But I find the approach interesting: taking the meme hype and combining it with a real-world use case.

⸻

🤔 Why Utility Might Matter

If we zoom out, why might this matter for the meme coin space?
	1.	Trust & Longevity → A meme coin with locked liquidity, no mint authority, and clear use case might keep a community longer than pure pump coins.
	2.	Adoption → If I can pay for my coffee or merch with a meme coin, that’s more fun (and more real) than just holding a bag hoping it moons.
	3.	Narrative Shift → The story changes from “get rich quick” to “this coin is part of my lifestyle.”

⸻

⚖️ Counter-Arguments

Of course, not everyone agrees. Some might say:
	•	Meme coins don’t need utility. The meme is the utility. The point is community and fun, not payments.
	•	Trying to “force” utility might kill the vibe. People don’t buy Dogecoin to buy coffee – they buy it because it’s Dogecoin.
	•	Adoption in shops is easier said than done. Most businesses aren’t ready to accept crypto yet, let alone a new meme coin.

All valid points.

⸻

🔮 My Take

Personally, I think the future might be a hybrid:
	•	Meme + Scarcity = fast hype
	•	Meme + Utility = long-term sustainability

If a coin can capture both, it might stand out in a crowded field.

This is why I found the Gangster Pepe Pay case study interesting. Limited supply, meme branding, AND a payment angle. Whether it works or not, we’ll see – but it’s an experiment worth watching.

⸻

💬 Discussion

So here’s my question to you, Reddit:

👉 Do you think meme coins need real-world use cases like payments to survive long-term?
Or is hype + community enough to keep them alive?

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

If this resonates with you, send me a message.",1,1756670264.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1n54efl,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1n54efl/am_i_being_unreasonable/,Am I Being Unreasonable?,"Please bear with me and then potentially back and forth of this post but I need to know whether I am being harsh with my expectations.

My partner (M33) and I (F33) have a 7 month old daughter. I am fortunate enough to be able to stay home with her and not work, and my partner works from home full time. 

My partner as I said above, works from home so is the sole provider for the household. Once he finishes work he cooks dinner for us (I don’t mind cooking, but throughout our relationship he has always done it and he enjoys doing it!). He also takes care of anything “handy” that needs doing around the house on weekends. 

I appreciate he does a lot, which is why I am so torn as to why I am feeling the way I am. 

Our daughter is EBF and will not take a bottle so for the last 7 months we have been joined at the hip. Anywhere I go, she goes too - which is absolutely fine. However, and maybe I am naive as this is our first child, but I thought at 7 months of age I’d have a slither of freedom by now. The last time I went anywhere alone was my 6 week check up after she was born.

Now this is where I am becoming almost “jealous” or possibly even slightly resentful at my husband, and honestly even other mums and their freedom. I am the 24/7 carer for our daughter. I’ve been up with her in the night every night since she’s been born (my partner says he’s tired as well, because he’s awake whilst we are - but he doesn’t understand the difference between the fact he has a choice to fall sleep whilst I feed, I don’t.) I entertain her all day, I take her out in the day, I put her to sleep every nap/bedtime, I change every nappy and do every bath and bedtime routine. The only time I get alone is a 10 min shower, or her nap times. 

Outside of those times I don’t get any other time to do what I want. My partner says I should use the nap times to do what I want, but I can’t leave the house as he’s working and I’ll be needed if she wakes crying? Because I am technically still “on shift” whilst she’s napping, it’s not really true downtime from her. I tidy the house during nap times, eat lunch and honestly drink a warm drink before it goes cold. 

I haven’t been to the gym since before she was born, I haven’t had my haircut since before she was born. If my hair gets any dryer I’ll have horses mistaking me for hay. I haven’t been for a coffee alone with friends since before she was born. My friends in my “mum group” can leave their babies at home with dad, but I could never. It’s my “job” to care take 24/7, just like it’s my partners “job” to provide. 

This weekend for example, he spent both days working on his truck. Where is my equal time to do what I want? During nap times but I can’t actually leave the house? 

Like I said, I appreciate the hard work he does for us to provide but I didn’t realise I’d feel so alone in this parenting journey as I am. I guess it really is true when they say the mums lives change but dads tend to stay the same. I just wonder whether he thinks I’ve got it “easy”. We live apart from our families so I can’t even call on them for help or rest-bite.

Honest Review,"The Aquasana AQ-5300+R replacement filter, designed for the 3-stage Max Flow Claryum under-sink water filtration system, has become a regular part of my kitchen routine. Since installing it, I’ve had plenty of time to test its performance, and while it has its advantages, there are also a few aspects that call for honest discussion.

**Ease of Installation and Everyday Use**  
Setting up the replacement filters was surprisingly simple. I only needed to twist off the old filter housing, insert the new one, and twist it back on. There’s no need to disconnect hoses or call a plumber, which is perfect for someone like me who isn’t exactly ""handy."" Within minutes, the filtration system was back to work, and I was sipping on clean, crisp-tasting water. For daily use, it’s hard to beat the convenience this system provides—goodbye bottled water, hello healthy hydration.

[Ready to buy Aquasana AQ-5300+R? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01lb0l6ms/)  

**Performance and Contaminant Reduction**  
The standout feature of this replacement filter is undoubtedly its ability to reduce up to 99% of 78 different contaminants. From chlorine to lead, pesticides to microplastics, it seems to target almost everything lurking in my tap water. I tested the water pre- and post-filtration with a basic home water test kit, and the difference was clear—literally. It’s also WQA certified and meets NSF/ANSI standards, which reassured me its claims are backed by testing. Coffee, tea, and even pasta now taste better since the water quality has improved dramatically.

**Design and Build Quality**  
These filter cartridges aren’t flashy—they’re functional. Made from plastic, the design prioritizes ease of use and compatibility with the existing system over aesthetics. Lightweight yet durable, the filters are compact (just 2.2 x 9.5 x 9.5 inches) and fit neatly under my sink. My only gripe is that while the design is practical, it doesn’t feel like it could withstand any misuse during installation.

**Benefits**  
- Straightforward to install without any tools or professional help.  
- Effectively reduces harmful contaminants, elevating water quality significantly.  
- Certified for safety and performance by reputable testing standards.  
- Long-lasting replacement filters, offering up to 800 gallons of usage per filter set.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Plastic construction feels a bit cheap and could be more robust.  
- Requires diligent maintenance to ensure performance doesn’t falter over time.  
- The filters only fit specific Aquasana systems, limiting compatibility.

**Other Options**  
Comparing this to competitors in the under-sink filtration market, I’ve used similar systems from Brita and Waterdrop. The Brita model comes off as a simpler and slightly more affordable alternative but lacks the robust contaminant-removal capacity found in this one. Waterdrop’s models offer advanced features like app monitoring, but they don’t filter out as many contaminants and tend to have shorter lifespans. Among these, the Aquasana replacement filters strike a good balance between advanced filtration and straightforward usability. However, the somewhat fragile build holds it back from truly dominating the category.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Cost-efficiency is a major factor to consider, and these replacements deliver decent value. With a capacity of 800 gallons per set, the cost per gallon drops down to something you barely notice. When comparing this to the expense of regularly buying bottled water, it’s a long-term money-saver. That said, recurring filter changes can add up, so I always weigh this against how much cleaner and safer the water feels. Based on performance alone, I’d argue it’s worth the investment if water quality is a concern in your household.

I don’t remember what the judge said. Something about irreconcilable differences and the best interest of the children. All I heard was the gavel and the silence after. My marriage was over. My daughter was gone. What stuck with me wasn’t the words, but the look my ex gave me across that table—a look of relief. And Emily… my little girl… she clung to her mother’s hand, wouldn’t even look at me. Like she already knew the truth: I wasn’t worth looking at.

I went home. The house felt hollow. No toys in the corner, no crayons scattered on the table, no cartoons rattling the walls. Just silence—and the half-empty bottle of Jack waiting where I’d left it that morning by the kitchen sink. I drank until my head hummed. Until the silence pressed down on me like a weight. A familiar and comforting feeling.

That’s when I thought I heard it—tap, tap, tap. Slow. Measured. Like someone pacing with a cane down my hallway. I froze, bottle halfway to my lips. I waited. Listened. Nothing but the house creaking and the blood in my ears. Must be the drink, I told myself, dismissing it. Just the drink. Just an old house. I drank more until the weight in my mind blurred, until I was on the edge of passing out.

—and that’s when the TV came on.

My eyes snapped open. I hadn't touched the remote. I hadn’t even looked at the thing. I stared at the blank screen, trying to make sense of it. A momentary power surge? The cable? But as I watched, the screen flared, filling the room with bright colors and the squeaky jingle of a theme song I knew too well.

“Hiya, kids! It’s time for Uncle Smiley’s Playhouse!”

A cold dread replaced the whiskey's warmth. This was impossible. This was wrong. It was Emily’s favorite show. I used to scream at her to turn it off. And now here it was, playing in my empty house.

Onscreen, Uncle Smiley danced, his oversized bowtie bouncing. In one hand he swung a polished black cane, twirling it and tapping it against the floor in rhythm with the music—tap, tap, tap. His head was too round, too shiny, his smile too wide. Behind him were the puppets: saggy Benny Bear, sharp little Freddie Fox, and floppy Ricky Rabbit. They clapped and hopped along. But the laughter track looped wrong—too high-pitched, warbling, like children choking on their giggles.

Smiley stopped dancing. He leaned toward the camera. Toward me.

“Well, well, well! Look who’s watching all by himself! Where’s your little princess, huh? Where’s Emily?”

My throat went dry. My mind reeled. How could it know? It was just a TV show. A recorded show. I stumbled to my feet. “Shut up,” I muttered, my voice shaky.

“Oh, don’t be shy, Daddy. We know why she’s not here. She doesn’t want to see you anymore! Isn’t that right, kids?”

Benny Bear’s big head bobbed. Freddie Fox’s button eyes rattled. Ricky Rabbit bounced. Disbelief warred with a gut-wrenching terror. I grabbed the remote, mashed the power button. Nothing. I tried the volume, the channel, anything. Nothing. My mind screamed for a rational explanation. A neighbor's prank? A hack? I yanked the plug from the wall. The screen stayed lit, humming with a defiant glow.

Smiley’s voice boomed from the speakers: “You can’t turn us off, Daddy. The fun’s only just begun!”

“You’re so silly!” Ricky Rabbit laughed hysterically.

The puppets lurched closer to the camera, their movements jerky, twitching like broken marionettes. Their button eyes gleamed wet, their stitched mouths twisting into something sharp. This was a nightmare. This couldn't be happening.

And then, one by one, they began to crawl out of the TV screen, the fabric of their bodies rippling as they emerged.

I watched, frozen in a state of sheer disbelief as Benny Bear’s head squeezed through the static, a raspy giggle spilling from his stitched mouth. Freddie Fox cut through the buzzing static like a knife. Ricky Rabbit flopped out last, his long ears dragging along the floor. Behind them, the screen went black. They were inside.

I ran into the kitchen as quick as my drunken legs could move. I could hear the shuffling scurrying sound coming after me. I crawled on all fours into the hallway.

Back in the kitchen I could hear presses opening, banging shut the sound of cutlery being rattled.

The sounds stopped and I turned around to be confronted with those tv animals.

“Hide and seek, Daddy!” Benny chirped, holding a razor sharp kitchen knife.

“We’ll find you!” Ricky squealed. Tapping a hammer in its rabbit paws like he had seen too many mob movies.

“We always do,” Freddie whispered menacingly My nail gun in his tiny paws a battery strapped on his back.

“Run” Ricky roared throwing the hammer at me, I ducked just in time as the hammer would have connected with my head had I not moved.

I stumbled backwards, smashing through the glass coffee table, shards of glass cutting my hands. The pain starting to sober me up.

The puppets scattered, wrecking the house as they went. The hammer smashed picture frames. Knives scraped along the walls. Freddie pulled the trigger on the nailgun, pop-pop-pop! Nails spat into the drywall, whining as they buried themselves.

I ran. Limped into the bedroom. Slammed the door. Locked it. My chest heaved. My heart felt like it was clawing through my ribs.

Scrambling for the bathroom en suite, I figured I could try to get out the window I closed and locked the door behind me.I stood on the toilet my hands dripping with blood. I lost my footing, hand prints smeared the glass as I went down hard, my right shoulder smashing into the bath tub. Sitting with my back against the wall I heaved to catch my breath.

Then the bathroom door shuddered. I pulled myself back up. A nail ripped through the wood an inch from my face. Another. Then another. Freddie’s cackling rose on the other side. One nail buried itself into my leg. Hot, searing pain exploded as I collapsed against the wall, screaming. Another went straight into my chest.

“Gotcha! Gotcha!” Ricky’s voice sang from outside, muffled through the wood. I pressed my hand to the wound on my chest, with my blood slicked palms. I dragged myself backward, toward the bathtub, teeth gritted, sobs breaking through.

And then—Tap. Tap. Tap.

Slow. Measured. Coming down the hallway. Smiley’s cane.

Each tap was deliberate, patient. Closer with every beat. I realized then: it hadn’t been the whiskey earlier. I’d heard him. He’d already been here.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

The lock shuddered. The hammer smashed again. The nails whined through wood. And over it all, Smiley’s voice drifted closer, warm and cruel, as the tap of his cane echoed outside the door:

$500-$1200

**Are you open to refurbs/used?**

Would prefer new, but for the right price I'd be open. 

**How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**

Leaning Clamshell/Ultrabook, but not fully against 2 in 1. 

Performance is key. I'll be on the road a lot with this laptop, but places where I can charge often, so battery is nice, but not top priority.


**How important is weight and thinness to you?**

Not really

**Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

14 or more

**Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**

Yes. 

Editing: Audacity, Divinci Resolve, Fruityloops, Krita

Writing: Obsidian, Google Drive, Fade In

Games: Binding of Issac, Streets of Rogue, Balatro, Civ

(Mostly rogue likes/turn based)

**If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

60fps

**Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**
 
I'd like it to be sturdy, and not have heat issues. 

(I had a gaming laptop on 2013 and it overheated all the time)

**Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

I'm not against 2 In 1s, I think the tablet/drawing form would be really neat and probably something I'd use. 

I'd just be worried to have structural/heat problems. 

I'm a nerdy guy with a gaming PC back home for bigger gaming and editing and all that, but I'd love this laptop to write and work on the road or just go to a coffee shop and write sometimes. Thanks in advance ! :)",1,1756669711.0,SuggestALaptop,0,1.0,False

I have a toddler boy that is from a 1 minute non consensual encounter. It has been my only physical experience with a man and it makes it extremely difficult to tell if I am being weird and blowing things out of proportion when it comes to possible sexual stuff. I can't really trust my gut. 


I am in a long-distance friendship/situationship kind of thing, but it's not officially a relationship and he sleeps with other people. It's serious for me but not really for him. I usually trust his judgment though and he looks out for me in situations like these.



I recently hired a nanny through an agency(it's very common where I live). This agency has the nannies look through prospective employers and they choose us. They have been having staffing issues lately, so getting a nanny is very hard and VERY competitive. My previous nanny was a woman, but she moved. This time, they placed a man, who we will call the manny. He is extremely recommended and came with great references as well as extensive child development training. He also looks like a very buff, well build model with great hair who happens to be straight and single from what he told me in our initial intake meeting. He's kind of beautiful I guess if you're into that. I am not interested in him romantically at all. I am grateful for how well he takes care of my little and he is very dependable. 



He has said a few things that he surely meant as innocent, but they made my tummy feel funny when he said them, and my friend said he meant them nefariously. I don't know when a man is flirting but these all seemed innocent to me. 



Examples:
He cooks every night(as well as day meals for the kiddo). Every time he cooks, he offers me a taste. I'll say no but he insists. He holds the spoon/fork out to me but for me to eat off, not to hold myself. He says ""do you want to taste? And I say okay. Then he will hold it out and say ""do you want this?"" And I said ""yes"" and he said ""yes, what?"" And I have to say ""yes please"" or he will hold it back and ask me again. And he makes eye contact always. A few times I have accidentally said yes please sir, because that's how i have been conditioned my whole life. He has no reaction as far as I can tell to this. It makes sense to me that he would want me to use my manners and say please since he works with children. 


This morning, he came early and I was unprepared for him to get here so I was sitting on the couch in my pajamas eating a bowl of cottage cheese. I haven't been really eating lately, something he's been noticing. So when he walked up and saw I was eating food, he said ""you're eating? Good girl"". It made my tummy feel funny when he said that so I kind of ignored him and put my bowl in the sink and went into my room. 


He sometimes commands me(I don't know if that's the right word to use in this context) to do something. 
He said ""put this book on the coffee table."" And I said okay, I will do it in a minute. He said ""do it now."" So I said okay and did it. Maybe he just needed help in that moment?


I feel like these are all just innocent statements when you look at the actual context. My friend said they are sexual and he knows what he is doing and said I should fire him. 

Am I the asshole if I don't fire the manny for these possible innocent comments? I don't want to fire someone who didn't do anything wrong. He is very good at his job.",9,1756669426.0,AITAH,33,0.76,False

Thus, I ask for your help.
This relationship is between a canon character and an OC, but it is more of a background of an action-heavy plot.
They start as neutral coworkers, then in chapter 1 the MC discovers she is part of a new group of villains, and they have a 1on1 fight (involving weapons) through chapter 2. They bicker and avoid each other at work, and a few weeks pass before in chapter three they start to find common ground. They start growing closer since then, and in chapter 5 they end up going out for a coffee (not clarifying if it's a date). Then shit goes wild and they are separated, though he tries to get to her to help, and they finally meet again in chapter 14, which is the big boss fight, and after that they get together.

It sucked for awhile but I didn’t let that emotion determine if I was still going to stick to MY rules. - do things despite emotions.

I get mental health, I’m also on meds. But like you can’t expect the meds to build you strong muscles you feel me? There’s no “quick fix” you also DO have to put in the effort hence why you NEED to do things despite how you feel emotionally.

Once you’ve done just those 3 things I’m telling you, you’ll feel better than you feel right now. You might still be depressed, but it won’t be as bad. You begin to build purpose and have intention with what you do and it makes living worth it.

1n53xxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n53xxk/all_the_pretty_things/,All the Pretty Things,"I am a reclusive old man living alone in the Appalachian wilderness, and I’ve lived in my little cabin for the better part of 50 years without incident. However, recently, things have started showing up on my doorstep- and the contents are horrifying. 

It started with a note. A sheet of notebook paper I found taped to my door one morning. 

It read, “It’s the pretty things that matter,” scrawled in black ink in large lettering across the page. On the back, there was a Polaroid. An off-kilter photo of what looked like a chest or box surrounded by trees. 

A bit confused and unsettled, I set the note and photo on my coffee table and went on about my day, journaling and reading. There’s not much to do in the woods of Appalachia, so my days were usually spent enjoying nature, hunting, and fishing. 

So that’s what I did, I finished my chapter and journal entry, then set off into the forest, rifle on my shoulder and fishing rod in hand. 

The woods were eerily silent this day, which, if you know anything about Appalachia, is not a good sign. I was confident with my rifle, though, and hiked on, following the path to the river that I’d taken a million times before. 

However, halfway through the hike, I discovered something that had not been on the trail before:
A bloodied doll head was nailed through the forehead into a towering pine that swayed with the wind, its body nowhere to be found. Below the head, etched into the bark with what I assumed was a pocket knife, the phrase, “isn’t she pretty?” jagged and messy. 

Feeling the unease wash over me, I decided it was best I return home for the day. The forest remained silent as I trekked back to the cabin, and it felt as though a million eyes were on me with each step I took. I could feel the atmospheric pressure change as thunder clapped overhead and the first droplets of rain began to fall. Making it back home, I locked up extra tight, placing a chair underneath my door handle and locking every window. 

The storm raged that night, and the wind howled outside, rocking the cabin back and forth gently. I had slept with my rifle, being the paranoid recluse that I am, and because periodically throughout the night, I thought I could hear the sounds of footsteps pounding against my front porch- pacing back and forth along the tiny 4x5 space. 

Life was brought to my fears when the next morning, I found a new gift at my doorstep: 
The tattered and dirty shirt that appeared to have belonged to a little girl, between the ages of 4 and 8. 

In denial, I tried rationalizing the experience by telling myself the weather had blown the shirt onto the porch, the wind had swept it up and carried it miles just for it to settle directly on my front porch. An attempt for me to walk away from the situation. However, that rationalization quickly crumbled when I picked up the shirt, and beneath it lay another Polaroid photo:

A little girl standing at a bus stop, oblivious. The same pink and purple butterflies on her shirt as the ones on the shirt I now held in my hands. On the back, in black Sharpie and neat handwriting was the phrase, “Isn’t she pretty?” with a smiley face underneath. 

I immediately loaded up into my old Ford Ranger and made my way to the closest police station, presenting them with the evidence. Looking into their missing persons database, they found a match for the girl in the picture. Only she had gone missing over 30 years ago, and her case had gone cold after about 15 years. I explained the events to the police, with the doll's head and the photo of the chest that I had received two nights ago, and they told me everything I already knew about Appalachia: how people go missing up here by the thousands every year, and how an absurd number of the cases go unsolved. Nevertheless, they assured me they’d examine the Polaroid for fingerprints and get back to me if they found any clues.

Being a gun owner, I refused any police protection at my residence, and I myself assured *them* that I too would be keeping a close eye out for any suspicious-looking person lurking near my remote cabin.

When I returned home, everything was just as I left it. No signs of any kind of trespassing or vandalism. I stayed in again this night, wanting to be here in case any more gifts arrived on my doorstep.  While I was at my stove cooking that night, through the sound of my radio playing 70’s rock music, I heard the creeping footsteps again on my front porch. 

I rushed to grab the rifle from my bedroom and came bursting through the front door to find the sight of a pale, sickly-thin man, crouched down and peering into my kitchen window, Polaroid camera strapped around his neck. He was completely nude and bald-headed, and once he saw me, he screeched like an animal before springing over the baluster.

I fired blind shots as he fled at inhuman speed into the woods, leaving shrubbery and branches shaking as he sprinted. I fired another shot into the forest in his direction and heard another screech, but the sprinting persisted. I leaped from the porch and chased as fast as I could through the dense forest, stumbling over roots and running into trees in the darkness. I could no longer hear the footsteps, so I gave up and walked back to the cabin, defeated. 

I did not sleep a wink that night. The whole evening was spent on my porch, waiting for him to come back. Next time, I would not miss. I waited until the sun came up, and no trace of the man returned. Becoming fluent in hunting during my time here in these woods, my first idea was to search for his blood. I had heard him screech again; I could’ve at least grazed an arm, and I could work from that. I searched the whole area and found no sign of blood anywhere. 

Defeated, I returned to the cabin. I went into town that day and bought some trail cameras that I placed around the area and on my porch. I was not going to miss my opportunity to catch or kill this guy again. Days came and went with no sign of the man. My trail cams caught nothing, and gifts stopped appearing on my doorstep. Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. I had almost succumbed and settled back into my life of comfort and serenity alone on my mountain until one faithful morning. 

A new gift was on my porch. Not only that, but doll heads were nailed to every tree surrounding the perimeter. It wasn’t just doll heads, either. Limbs were separated from the torsos and crudely nailed to the trees, making them look like dissected bodies. 

The same message under each display:

“Isn’t she pretty?”

The new gift was a jewelry box, dusty and decaying. Inside were dozens of rusted and bloodied earrings, each one bearing some variation of a butterfly. 

After this, things escalated faster than I could account for. 

I took the jewelry box to the police station and yet again explained the situation to the local police chief. The earrings were taken in for DNA examination, and as the earrings were being removed, a new Polaroid was found underneath the pile. 

It was me, asleep in my bed, completely unaware, taken from beyond my bedroom window.

The chief insisted I have police protection at my cabin, and this time I agreed. This man had managed to find the one blind spot in my trail cams, and now he was toying with me. DNA testing takes anywhere between 24 and 72 hours, so once more, I returned to the cabin, officers at my rear. 

As you’d imagine, it’s difficult for me to park my Ranger on my property, let alone two additional police cars. That being said, the officers had to park their cruisers on the dirt road at the end of the driveway. The two officers stayed in their cars the whole night, rendering them nearly useless. That’s what makes what happened next so frustrating.

It had started to storm again, and lightning strikes flooded the cabin with flashing light every few seconds. Something was off, though, the strikes seemed...out of sync with the storm. I focused in on this and noticed that there would be three quick flashes of light after every *big* flash of light, and then there’d be thunder. 

Lightning struck again, and in the living room window, the outline of the man came into view. Three flashes came from his face before the outside went dark again. 

Once again, I ran outside, rifle in hand, but this time the man was gone completely, without a trace.
Immediately, I confronted the cops in their useless cars, demanding they help search the area. They dared to seem annoyed with me as we searched the woods in the pouring rain. Finding nothing, the officers returned to their vehicles. By this point, it was around 4 in the morning, and the storm began to let up. Against my better judgment, I allowed myself rest. I awoke to sunshine and birds singing, a stunning contrast to the previous night. 

Stepping onto my porch, in place of a gift, I found dozens of Polaroids of myself arranged into the shape of a butterfly. Right in the center of the collage, I found something that broke me. 

My daughter, laughing as I pushed her on the swing. As happy as could be. 

25 years ago, she had gone missing from our front yard as my wife and I worked around the house. 

Her disappearance broke me and my wife apart, and we divorced soon after, leading me to move here, into this cabin. 

I felt my heart break all over again, and I began to break down. I was absolutely grimaced to find that the police cars were no longer at the end of my driveway and were nowhere to be found. 

I lost my mind. I stomped through the forest screaming at the top of my lungs for the man to reveal himself, for him to show himself to me, and to stop being such a coward. 

The forest had grown silent again, aside from the sound of leaves rustling around me. The noise surrounded me as if something were running in circles around me, studying me. I couldn’t even discern where it ended, but when it did, it was immediately replaced with a single sound: 

*click*

My shroud of sanity fell, and I fired shots wildly in all directions. I listened as the unnaturally fast footsteps raced off deeper into the forest, laughing like a banshee.

This was the last I saw of the man for a while. DNA evidence from the earrings came back as a match for 36 different missing children from the 80s and 90s. This time, a whole team came up to my little cabin and searched extensively for miles. Unbelievably, a warrant was served for the search of the cabin itself, which I obliged, too tired to care. 

The search went on for months, and nothing was found. I’d stare at the pictures of the man, naked on my trail camera, and burning hatred filled my heart. Murderous resentment that would keep me awake at night. 

The last gift the man has left me was his box from the first Polaroid he ever gave me. 

A traveler's trunk that you’d see on a train, across the top, the phrase “All the pretty things.”
I opened it to find dozens of doll heads along with dismembered arms and legs made from hollow plastic. I found a variety of clothing, all with butterflies stitched into the fabric. But above all, I found pictures of dozens of little girls, none older than 12. Blood speckled the top of the pile, and I wanted to throw up, staring into the case. 

I kneeled there over the box, completely lost for words and in a trance for what felt like hours. The one thing that snapped me out of this state was when I heard the rustling of leaves off in the distance, followed by a sound that broke me:

Today is one of those days where I miss you especially. I woke up to period cramps and can't go back to sleep, and now it's 3 o'clock in the morning Manila time. The silence feels heavier when you have no one to reach out to at this ungodly hour. Since your day starts early in Australia, I know you're probably already up, maybe making your morning coffee or checking your phone. Why did I have to erase my only way to reach you? It felt necessary then, but now I can only imagine sending you messages like this, picturing exactly how you'd respond—probably with that mix of feigned concern and gentle teasing that always made me feel less alone.

On my next trip to Japan, I'll surely find myself imagining once again how different it would be if you were there with me. Instead of me meticulously planning every detail of my itinerary alone, we'd be figuring it out together, probably arguing over whether to hit up more ramen spots or save room for those ridiculously expensive but Instagrammable desserts. 
I'd still take you to my favorite Ichiran first—you'd probably make fun of how I always order the same thing—and then yes, you'd have my full permission to drag me to a maid cafe, even though we both know I'd spend the entire time either side-eying you for sending flirtatious comments to the servers in their frilly dresses and cat ear headbands, or laughing at how absurd it all is.

But here's the thing that keeps me up at nights like this: we may never speak to each other again, may never cross paths in this lifetime. That thought sits heavy in my chest sometimes. Despite everything, I hope you're in the best place mentally, that you're finding joy in the small things, that someone else is there when you need them at 3 a.m.—even if that someone is just a friend with benefits.

Yours sincerely,

80g milk + extra

Make the lemon juice and baking soda react (sodium citrate will be the result once the bubbles stop, the result should not be acidic, if it is add a really really low amount of baking soda, let it react and get it stable again... 0.1g or less should be enough).

Mix the first 80g of milk to the water sodium citrate mix and heat it up,

Mix little by little the parmigiano rinds powder (the more it is a powder the less visual defect you will get, but if they are small enough even if you get a visual defect you will not taste it at all (like the one in my photo)), in the beginning the powder will make lumps, but most of them should melt, if you did it slow enough you will get melted american cheese that you can boil without breaking the emulsion no problem.

Add a splash of milk once the first 80g gets incorporated/evaporate until you get a good uniform consistency... after that you should evaporate/incorporate the residual milk until the paste is almost dry and put it on parchment paper to cool down.

After a few minutes you will be able to cut it and separate from the parchment paper (now you can separate it easily so do it before it's too late). After that you can put it on parchment paper again and next time you try to use it after it has been in the fridge it should not stick too much to the parchment paper.

For multiple reasons, but mostly the wear and tear on my body after only one year and the new customer service rules and stuff. I mostly spent my shifts on bar and loved it, until I was getting hounded for selective customer connections. I’ve always tried my best to welcome people in and say good morning to everyone that walks by but what I’m not gonna do is try to engage with people that want to get their coffee and be left alone. Plus, the whole chain of command stuff kinda bothered me. I’m very much a believer in, if I’m doing something wrong, just correct me. What’s been happening in my store is a lot of “hey girly… blah blah told me to tell you that blah blah isn’t standard (stuff that was never told to me because I wasn’t trained properly). Jsyk.” I know everyone is just doing their job but I flourish in a direct communication environment and “this person told me to tell you” kind of creates a little resentment for me when being critiqued. Don’t get me wrong, I want to know if I’m doing something wrong. I love learning and following the rules but I feel like there’s a good way and bad way to coach. Even down to telling me to tell others what the play is for peak or make sure they’re doing something right just isn’t on me (a lowly barista), and I feel like should be done by their supervisor.

Santorini, Naxos, Crete (August Trip Report)","We just returned from two weeks in Greece (August 10 to 26). Reddit helped me so much when planning this trip that I wanted to give back with this post. Ask me anything.

# Santorini (3 nights, Amber Light and Rocabella)

First night was at **Amber Light**, where we saw the most beautiful sunrise. The last two nights were at **Rocabella**, which was incredible in every way with service, views, and food.

People told us to skip Santorini because of the crowds, but we never even went to Oia or Fira. By staying outside those towns, it was calm and romantic.

I proposed to my fiancée at **Athermi Suites** during their *Dinner Under the Stars.* It is a private dinner at sunset, and we got lucky with no wind that night. It felt like the most romantic place on Earth. Service was great. Absolutely magical.

**Highlights:**

* **Santo Wines**, the best sunset I have ever seen, plus great wine flights.
* Staying away from Oia and Fira gives you peace and space to enjoy the island.
* Taxis were very straightforward, no issues with finding one when we needed it.

# Naxos (4 nights, Naxos Town)

We ferried from Santorini to Naxos. Smooth ride, no chaos, no seasick passengers like people had warned us. Maybe we just got lucky. Take seasick meds just incase.

We stayed at Georgia Mare because I was able to use my Chase points here, it's a family owned hotel about a 5 to 10 minute walk to the main town and port. The owners were so welcoming, and the homemade breakfast by the owner every morning was amazing. Being right there meant we did not need a car, except for one trip to Rotonda. 

**Rotonda Resturant** is a must at sunset. We booked it, and it was incredible. We took the bus up, which was cheap and easy, and it worked out great but make sure to look at the bus schedule because we almost missed the last bus back. If you have a car it is even easier.

**Highlights:**

* **Cheese**, Naxos cheese is everywhere, and it is fantastic. We ended up doing a cheese and wine tasting at a restaurant called Avaton 1739 which had an amazing view. 
* **Etere**, probably the best tasting dinner we had in Greece, and we stumbled into it by accident.
* **Yasouvlaki**, casual, delicious gyros.
* **The Locals Coffee Spot**, daily stop for iced coffee in the middle of everything.
* We booked a cave kayaking excursion in Naxos, but it was cancelled the day before because of the wind. We heard from others that it is incredible and worth booking if the weather allows.

# Crete (6 nights, Chania base)

We ferried from Naxos to Crete, again smooth and easy.

Crete feels completely different from the Cyclades. It is bigger, more spread out, and I'd definitely recommend renting a car. We based in **Chania** at an Airbnb with a kitchen, which was perfect for resetting after moving around.

**Highlights:**

* **Old Venetian Harbor** for evening walks.
* **Sunset catamaran trip**, swimming, calm seas, great crew. 
* **Cooking class**, this was our favorite thing we did in Crete. Amazing produce and hosts. [Veerna's Kitchen](https://chaniacookingclass.com/)
* **Cafe Rest Pallas**, splurge worthy dinner with a harbor view.
* Local markets and Wolt delivery for easy meals. Some nights we just wanted to relax at our Airbnb and watch the sunset from the patio, so we ordered through Wolt, which is basically a cheaper version of DoorDash.
* We visited **Elafonisi Beach** (with the pink sand) was super windy but still fun.
* We also did **Katholiko Bay.** If you are doing this, know that it is about an hour hike each way. We are in good shape and it just about killed us because we weren't prepared, so bring plenty of water and be prepared. Because this drained us we did not do Samaria Gorge, but everyone we spoke to told us it is beautiful.

**Tips:** Rent a car. We rented ours from [https://autorentals-crete.gr/](https://autorentals-crete.gr/) and it was by far the cheapest option we found. The service was great and we had no problems. Our ferry arrived at Heraklion Port and we picked it up there, then dropped it off at the airport in Chania. We got lucky with the timing of the drive from Heraklion to Chania and had a beautiful sunset almost the whole way. Driving in Greece takes getting used to, drivers do not stop for pedestrians and you must always watch out for mopeds and scooters. Parking in old town is tough, and if you get a ticket they will take your license plate. In my opinion it is easiest to find a parking garage and leave the car there. Definitely recommend Chania over Heraklion after talking to locals and other tourists.

# Money and Expenses

Flights from the Western US and ferries together cost us about $3,216.45 dollars. Beyond that, island spending added up. In Santorini we spent the most on lodging and special dinners like Athermi Suites and Rocabella, plus wine tastings and taxis. In Naxos our costs were mostly food and smaller excursions, Georgia Mare was booked on points so that saved a lot. In Crete we had the Airbnb cost, car rental, fuel, and experiences like the cooking class, catamaran, and long drives. All in, we ended up spending a little under $10,000 dollars for the trip. I am happy to share the exact breakdown if anyone is curious.",3,1756668489.0,GreeceTravel,0,0.8,False

It all started new years eve with a meet bc that was all of our kinda thing, there was about 5-6 of us in total who would travel to different states and meet our discord friends as a group. I wasnt looking for a partner let alone someone to sleep with but here she was in all her glory. Strong, Independent, a little bit quirky but Beautiful nonetheless. Met up with her at her job so that we could go back to her place and meet up with our friends and she threw in a lil “thats my boyfriend” joke out to her coworkers, she ended up manifesting it shortly after. We meet up with friends and signs are being thrown everywhere with body language, eye contact and mentions of similar music taste because i was on aux while we all got ready. Me being me I like to prioritize the friend group before any relationship because I prize my friends both irl and online, so i pretend to not notice the very evident signs to maintain that philosophy. We got ready and ended up meeting my (gay) friend through twitter because he’s my longest standing friend in nyc and also bc he knows bar owners and such, who doesnt like free drinks? during that same encounter he mentions how the same girl is staring at me every time I look over and catch up to him and that I should say something cute to her, eventually she got up to use the bathroom and when she came back I moved her chair back for her and said something nice but genuine. Her face started turning red and blushing and I was in shock honestly(I havent talked to a girl in a long time romantically) but I just kind of left it at that and didnt attempt entertaining it more. That was until we got back to her place and we were all taking turns playing games on her PC except her, she was in a separate room while we texted each other. Eventually that led to me going into the other room and things happened, at first i got anxious because im thinking of the integrity of the friend group first and foremost but was reassured that it was simply casual and that they didnt need to know, to which i complied. That was until we woke up the morning after and we all got up to get ready bc she worked and we wanted to explore the city and be close by when she got off. We grab our coffees and breakfast sandwiches, chill in central park for a bit and as she leaves for work she kisses me twice in front of all our friends.. once on the cheek and the other on the lips. Boy was I in a predicament in that moment with dozens of questions being asked only the second day into the meet up where I just kept repeating I plea the fifth. I didnt know what it was at first and didnt ask her to be my gf until i revisited and it was just us two. She gets off of work and we all go out to eat together then get ready for the rave and pregame. Was an amazing experience for my second rave ever, she broke me out of my comfort zone enough for us dance together for a couple of hours and it turns out I like house music more than I thought. At the end of that first trip I knew something was different because my heart started skipping a beat and I felt a spark that hadn’t been ignited in literal years. Despite my own concerns I took it calm and collected which led to me going back after 2 weeks. We went out to a posh bar a couple blocks from her house and before that we had established ground rules which included no being touchy, kissing, pda-esque type of antics for the sake of us getting to know each other better which i agreed without hesitation. For some reason every time her and I would go out we would get free drinks and it happened in that moment too, she would point it out and I thought it was kinda cool ngl. An hour passes by and we went from talking, to her having her hand on my thigh and us making out in public lmfao. The emotional intensity and the way in which she cared very intricately is what encapsulated me, yea there was some red flags and underlying trauma but lets be honest here we all have problems. I was willing to work with what was being portrayed not because I thought I could fix her but because we had a lot in common, I care about her deeply and had the same friend group it all felt so familiar. Everything was going good until about the 3rd month in when she had noticed I followed a girl back on twitter and thought I was liking a photo of that girl behind her back. Granted I acknowledge I shouldn’t have followed the girl if I had known that it was considered cheating to her but “being a lustful man” is such a broad statement and it’s not like I had intent of entertaining this person by liking, commenting or DMing. So I quickly reassured her and blocked the girl like any guy would to make his girl happy. This event alone led to a series of similar events through the duration of the relationship where I would be accused of liking or entertaining other women simply because they would show up on her TL or because she would look through my followers/followings. Eventually I did like a photo 5 months in of my friend (who is a girl and has a bf of 3 years now) that I played overwatch with and she flipped the hell out on me by saying that i breached her trust AGAIN by having someone around who i was “interested” in which granted for full context I did try sliding in this girls dms 2 years before my exwBPD entered the picture and quickly got shut down saying she had a bf but we both decided to keep it platonic and let bygones be bygones, she eventually started saying stuff like im a lustful cheating gooner and a bunch of other things to which I felt the need to end the relationship there because I know in my heart there was no lustful intent and that my exwBPD stated at the beginning of the relationship she doesnt care if i have female friends, i made sure that if a girl were around that they had partners or were really close with my ex. Eventually she talked me into staying after that incident but to which I never saw my sweet girl again. I kept getting told how im a liar and I cheated on her three times and how I should be grateful that she hasnt dumped my ass while talking about getting rid of me in her girls group chat so she can start dating again, this was before I had even liked the picture of that girl. I also caught her streaming people who liked her on tinder but to be honest as someone who doesnt use dating apps and isnt insecure i didnt really think too much into it because they were “making fun of men” but in retrospect even if that were the case, you still are scoping out your options whether it be consciously or subconsciously to me. 6 months hit and I could feel the change in dynamic of the relationship but the hopeless romantic in me tries to love her harder + more and I gave her full access to all my socials so that we can both clear any doubt and reassure her when necessary. I would unfollow any single women who would make her uncomfortable with no doubt in my mind because this is who I wanted. For months 6 and 7 it was starting to show the trauma/insecurity of previous relationships she never healed from because it went from unfollow onlyfans girls / sex workers / ewhores which is super valid, to us both catching her in the act of wanting me to unfollow people from high school on IG. It got to a point where the only people I followed on IG were people in relationships, who have kids, meet both of those criteria, or swing in the opposite direction. I was fine with that if it made her happy, but in reality those last two months where the shouting matches stopped and I thought we were starting to communicate effectively was just a facade. She was using this time to detach from the relationship before physically leaving from it. I helped her get into therapy which only lasted two sessions but at least there it was a start rather than dealing with it undiagnosed. Month 7 comes around and she hits me with the we need to talk on monday noon-ish. I could already tell based on her cold tone of voice that it was coming, i had never heard her like this. Mind you she did this 3 days before I had planned to go see her (I live in D.C. she lives in NYC) and i was utterly devastated because I had bought her a Swarovski necklace with her birth stone as a promotion gift and making it past 6 months. I wanted to give it to her in person along with the usual bouquet of flowers and some of her favorite sweets but never got that final chance to do so. I ended up having to ship it along with all her make up and clothes she left at my place along with some pictures i printed of us together with notes behind each picture that correlates to that moment exactly, to which she called me when the package was received and I finally got to hear her voice 3 weeks after the break up. She sounded frantic and numb at the same time which is wild to even type in the same sentence but it was like hearing different connotations/tone of voice/versions of the girl I love. She ended up hitting me with the we are not getting back together and I knew it was over for sure right then and there, I had no choice but to accept it and live with my grief. I was doing somewhat fine until I get news last week and some change ago that she completely cut ties with all of her core friend group by unfriending/blocking and kicking them from her server and replacing them with her coworkers. So I decided to reach out of genuine concern not with the intention of rekindling the relationship because it’s quite worrying but was met with dismay. I didnt expect her to open but it was like I dont recognize who im talking to anymore and should have kept no contact going. I wanted to be the partner who stood by her in the midst of the storm but I am not the “silhouette” i once was at the start of the relationship. I realize now after a month and a half that it’s something no matter how hard I love and exert effort into this that it is a battle she needs to face on her own whether she chooses to confront it and break the cycle or shy away and let the cycle repeat. It hurts so bad knowing this because I was so fine by myself in solitude then here she comes and my love for her goes beyond romantic, at the end of the day I just want her to make the right choices and live the life she truly wants, whether thats with me or not.

I’ve had an eating disorder or problems with my weight and food for going on 5 years now. This past year was the worse it’s ever been, I ending up loosing 30 pounds within a 3 month span and being unhealthily skinny. This is really the first time people around began to notice a problem other than my intimate family who knew about my struggles with food. My cheer coach, cousins, friends, sister, mom, aunts, pretty much anyone u can think of attempted to reach out and help me and I resisted every bit of it. People were going around my small town asking about me and concerned for me. And truthfully it all just began to fuel this fire to me to keep going. Seeing the number drop and hearing how people could finally notice my “discipline and hard work” felt so good in my messed up brain. I am still stuck in the loop unfortunately and I see no way out. My mom has threatened treatment and doctors and therapy to me many times but I never took her serious. I’ve ghosted multiple therapists and doctors and now I’m being seriously threatened with going to a center hours away with no family contact, no phone, nothing. As far as my health, I couldn’t tell you the last time I’ve gotten my period, it’s been years. I often black out or see spots anytime I get up or stand up for too long, the general side effects. Mental wise, I’ve always struggled with depression on and off since I was like 10 years old so this ed just it hit its peak this past year on top of everything else. For my social life, I never go out with any friends or family anymore in fear of food being involved or being asked why I’m not eating. So I pretty much have no one close to me anymore and it’s my fault, I’ve been a bad friend and family member to be honest and feel so selfish. I want to get better so bad to be able to LIVE again while I’m still young but I just can’t seem to do it. The thought of ever gaining weight back makes me sick to my stomach and I take 5 steps backwards anytime I take one forward. I’m just here I guess to see if anyone can give me some encouragement to get better and enjoy my life again? I don’t know anyone personally who deals with this and I feel very alone attempting to explain to anyone who just doesn’t get it. Even when the risk of death, being infertile, anything serious gets brought up, it never scares me enough to get better. I think I’ve gotten to a point of just pure numbness and nothing has weight on me anymore. I just miss my old self and my personality, it’s gone completely and I hate even speaking to anyone or being seen out in public. My sister asked me to go for coffee today and I need encouragement to go do it, she’s one person who always make me feel better and I’ve neglected our relationship due to not wanting to go out for coffee/food like we used to.

She then ended her year-long relationship to begin seeing this 18-year old 2 days after meeting her. The 18-year old is unaware of these circumstances. Am I overreacting/overstepping if I talk to the 18-year old about it? 

Fake names used for privacy. 

My teammate, Grace, was in a long distance relationship (4 hours apart) with Anna for just over a year. They met online shortly after Grace got out of a 2-year long relationship. At first, they were on FaceTime constantly (5+ hours a day). Communication was non-stop and they visited each other as often as possible, even missing class and sports commitments to see each other for just a few hours.

Despite this questionable start, they remained together for over a year. Until last week, the relationship, according to Grace, was going well and they had considered moving in together in May after graduating university. However, about a month ago, when we received the list of the new freshman on our team, Grace began to point out how attractive one of them was. We’ll call her Rachel. She followed all of her social media and was seemingly obsessed. She’d text me saying, “did you see Rachel’s post? She looked so good,” all while in a relationship with Anna.

I became concerned about this and the fact that Rachel is 18, while Grace is 22. I myself am in a relationship with that age gap– I just turned 21, my parter is 24, but I worry about the maturity difference of someone just starting college. They are 5 grades apart, Grace is a senior and took a gap year after finishing high school.

We started sports practices last Sunday. By Tuesday, Grace, from seemingly nowhere, was very confident about the fact she needed to break up with Anna because the long distance commitments were too much. This seemed reasonable at first because she had sacrificed her grades and sleep to make the drive to visit Anna many times. She also said she wanted to be single and figure out her life a little.

We had an important try out for the team on Friday, so Grace decided she was going to wait to break up with Anna until Friday evening. She, however, thought it was a good idea to ignore Anna until then so Anna could figure out that something was wrong. She thought this would make it easier.

On Thursday, when I asked Grace how she was going to do the break up, she said she was going to send Anna a text and block her… after 1+ years of dating. I told her that she needed to at least call Anna and explain herself. After 2 days of practically ignoring Anna and only sending brief messages, Anna reached out to me to make sure Grace was okay. Grace seemed very upset and was quite stressed about ending things. Anna then messaged Grace, “please confirm you aren’t going to break up with me, I’m worried about you.” Grace responded, “I can’t do that,” with no further explanation.

By then, Grace had obtained Rachel’s phone number and they were texting quite a bit. I could tell their interactions were flirtatious, and suspected the sudden reason for ending her relationship with Anna had to do with Rachel. I was concerned that this would affect Rachel’s adjustment to college and the team, as we’re all on the same sports team. Beginning to date someone in the first week of college is a great way to make no friends and isolate yourself, in my opinion.

That evening, Anna again tried to ask if Grace was okay and doordashed food to Grace’s house, twice. Grace then suddenly left and did not return for over 2 hours. Another teammate was able to confirm that Grace had gone to Rachel’s dorm and remained there for that time.

Friday morning, Grace told one of her roommates that her and Rachel had admitted to liking each other (after “knowing” each other for 5 days). We sat Grace down after the tryout and asked about Anna. She told us she “had to” end it over text because Anna wouldn’t stop messaging her. She never picked up the phone to call her, but assured us she would that evening. We asked her where she had gone the previous night and she said she was just driving around. When we told her we new that wasn’t true, she back-pedaled and said she’d stopped at Rachel’s room briefly because Rachel had asked her to come over and admitted to having a crush on her. We told her that pursuing anything with Rachel was a bad idea because Rachel needed time to adjust to college and make her own friends. Grace claimed it was 1-sided and that they were just going to be friends because dating a freshman was a bad idea. She assured us that nothing was happening, but that evening, I overheard her on the phone, saying that Rachel was just her type and that they were going on a date the next day.

The following morning, I saw them together at a local coffee shop. They didn’t see me, so Grace doesn't know I’m aware that she lied. Mind you– this all happened within 24 hours of questionably ending her year long relationship. When she admitted to liking Rachel Friday night, she had not yet ended it.

I’m concerned, as someone who is both Grace’s and Rachel’s teammate, that this is an incredibly bad idea. They are texting constantly and have spent hours together in the last 2 days. Grace is obviously unreceptive to the idea and is lying to me, and others, about it. Rachel has no idea that Grace was obsessing over her for half of the summer. I also worry that Grace hasn’t explained to Rachel what happened with Anna. I don’t want to sit here and watch Rachel be manipulated into an obsessive relationship with someone 4 years older than her. I know they are both adults, however, I personally feel that Rachel is unaware of the circumstances and is in a vulnerable position.

Same type of countertop as previously mentioned with a terra-cotta/clay pot-ish colored backsplash. Possibly with some hand painted/glazed floral tiles mixed in with the patterned.

1n5360s,https://v.redd.it/mby8ysjqlemf1,The Human Element of Cybersecurity: Smart Habits for a Safer Digital Life,"While advanced software and complex algorithms play a vital role in cybersecurity, the most crucial component in safeguarding our digital lives is often the human element. Our daily habits, awareness, and choices are the frontline defense against a myriad of online threats. This article shifts the focus from purely technical solutions to the essential behavioral changes and smart habits everyone can adopt for a significantly safer digital experience.

**Beyond the Firewall: Cultivating a Security Mindset**

A truly secure online existence begins with a proactive and informed mindset.

1. **Treat Your Data Like Gold:**
   * **Information Value:** Recognize that every piece of your personal information – from your email address to your birthdate – has value to cybercriminals. Be judicious about what you share and where you share it.
   * **Minimalist Sharing:** Adopt a ""need-to-know"" approach. If a website or app doesn't genuinely need a piece of information to function, consider whether you should provide it.
2. **Cultivate Healthy Skepticism:**
   * **Question Everything:** In the digital realm, assume nothing is 100% trustworthy until verified. Be skeptical of unsolicited messages, too-good-to-be-true offers, or urgent requests for action.
   * **Verify Sources:** If you receive a suspicious message from a known entity (like your bank or a friend), contact them through an independently verified channel (e.g., call their official number, or log directly into their website) rather than replying to the message or clicking its links.
3. **Understand the ""Why"" Behind Security:**
   * **Beyond Compliance:** Don't just follow security rules blindly. Understanding why strong passwords are vital, or why software updates are crucial, empowers you to make smarter decisions even in new situations.

**Smart Habits for Everyday Digital Interactions**

These practical habits can dramatically reduce your vulnerability to common online threats:

1. **The ""Pause and Ponder"" Rule for Clicks:**
   * **Think Before You Click:** Before clicking any link or opening any attachment, especially in emails or social media messages, take a full second to consider its source and context. Is it expected? Does it look legitimate?
   * **Hover to Reveal:** Get into the habit of hovering your mouse pointer over links to preview the actual URL before clicking. If it doesn't match the expected destination, don't click.
2. **Regular Account Check-ups:**
   * **Password Refresh:** Periodically change your most critical passwords (email, banking).
   * **Privacy Settings Review:** Social media platforms and other services frequently update their privacy settings. Make it a habit to review your settings every few months to ensure they still align with your preferences.
   * **App Permission Audits:** On your smartphone and computer, regularly check the permissions granted to installed apps. Remove permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.
3. **Public Wi-Fi Prudence:**
   * **Assume Insecurity:** Treat all public Wi-Fi networks (coffee shops, airports, hotels) as inherently insecure.
   * **Limit Sensitive Activities:** Avoid conducting sensitive transactions (online banking, shopping with credit cards, logging into email) over public Wi-Fi.
   * **Use a VPN:** If you must use public Wi-Fi for work or sensitive browsing, always use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic.
4. **Device Physical Security:**
   * **Lock Your Screens:** Always use a PIN, pattern, or biometric lock on your smartphone, tablet, and computer, even when you step away for a moment.
   * **Beware of Shoulder Surfing:** Be mindful of who might be looking over your shoulder when you're entering passwords or sensitive information in public spaces.
5. **Digital Decluttering:**
   * **Delete Unused Accounts:** If you no longer use an online service, take the time to close the account properly. Each active account is a potential point of vulnerability.
   * **Remove Old Data:** Regularly delete old files, apps, and data from your devices and cloud storage that you no longer need. Less data lying around means less data to potentially compromise.
6. **Teach and Learn Continuously:**
   * **Educate Others:** Share your knowledge of online safety with family, friends, and colleagues. A stronger community is a safer community.
   * **Stay Informed:** The threat landscape constantly evolves. Follow reputable cybersecurity news sources to stay updated on the latest threats and protective measures.

By consciously integrating these human-centric habits into our daily routines, we transform ourselves from passive users into active participants in our own cybersecurity. It's not just about having the right software; it's about adopting the right mindset and making smart choices that collectively build a resilient digital life.",1,1756667292.0,u_Manunitedmrk,0,1.0,False

I have had the hardest time finding coffee that I like and I’ve been trying because everyone around me seems to love coffee (I usually just get lemonades at Starbucks but I don’t like the year-round ones, mostly just the summer berry and cranmerry orange).

But! I found a coffee I actually like and I was so excited. I didn’t get it at Starbucks but I’m thinking I may be able to try something similar. Unfortunately I don’t have the exact ingredients because it’s a seasonal menu item for that place and they don’t post those on their website.

It’s called the Peaches and Dream latte. It was an iced vanilla latte with peach puree and I got it with nonfat milk. When I asked for nonfat milk, she told me it has a splash of heavy cream and asked it that was okay. So I think it’s an iced vanilla latte with peach puree and some heavy cream? But I don’t know how much the heavy cream impacts the taste. 

I was wondering if I could try to recreate this with strawberry puree. I really liked the peach flavor and how it didn’t taste “artificial” (I tried the raspberry syrup at Starbucks the other day and just didn’t really like it, the peach puree tasted more like fruit and I really liked that). And I’ve also found that iced lattes work better for me because the coffee flavor doesn’t seem to be as strong? 

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions for how to order this? Or, if you think of something else I might like based on my description, that would be great too. I’m just trying to start liking coffee like other people 😅

Need your suggestions,"I [24F] have been doing an internship for the past two months, where one of my seniors [38M] also works. We’ve only had brief, work-related interactions, usually short yes/no type conversations. He’s single, hardworking, respected by colleagues, and I’ve noticed he’s more casual and chatty with other interns, but not so much with me.

Over time, I’ve developed a crush on him. I admire his dedication, how others enjoy working with him, and his playful side when he laughs. With my internship coming to an end, I’m realizing how much I’ll miss seeing him on a daily basis.

I don’t know whether he feels anything toward me, and I haven’t had the chance to talk with him outside of work topics. I’m unsure how to manage these feelings. Part of me is considering asking him for a casual coffee before my internship ends, but I’m also worried about our age gap (24 vs. 38), even though he comes across as youthful in personality.

How can I navigate this situation without making things awkward or unprofessional?

TL;DR: I [24F] developed a crush on a senior colleague [38M] during my internship. We’ve only spoken briefly at work, but I admire him and don’t know how to handle my feelings. Unsure if I should ask him out for coffee before the internship ends, and I’m also concerned about the age difference.

1n52wne,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1n52wne/a_revigorating_swim/,A Revigorating Swim,"Ty’s been here for two months, but this morning his bed feels uncomfortable. Guess it’s just one of those days. He reaches over to grab his wristwatch. It’s morning-time, but a little bit earlier than when he likes to wake up. A few moments pass before he wills himself out of the bed. He may as well get up if he can’t fall back asleep. Should he go for a jog or swim? He ponders this question as he changes out of his pajamas. He can’t do either activity wearing PJs. Once his mind is made up, Ty departs, carefully leaving the Hermes cabin. It’s still early in the morning after all. The last thing he wants is to get scolded by any cranky and sleep-deprived Hermes campers. 

The half-risen sun and light-orange sky reflect in the ocean a distance from camp. A slight breeze flows along the shoreline, carrying a few sand grains with it as it blows by. Ty had a feeling the weather was going to be a bit chilly today. Call it a gut feeling. This isn’t the first time he’d had predictions like that. The boy sets his towel and shoes down in the sand. He walks closer to the shoreline before stopping to admire the scenery. The water washing up on the shoreline floods his feet as he reminisces. How long has he been at camp? Almost 3 months so far? It feels like just yesterday he was dropped off on the beach.

He’s been here almost 3 months, and what has he accomplished? Did he go to New London with everyone else? No. Has he started gathering information about Cole? No… Has he even been claimed yet? Still, the answer remains no. The last one has started to become a sore spot for Tyrese. Each passing day only adds to his frustration. He tried to be open-minded initially, but he’s losing confidence and patience. How long does it take a God or Goddess to acknowledge their child? Tyrese lets out an exasperated sigh at his circumstances and himself. This isn’t what he came out here for. He came here to swim, not to harp about his shortcomings. Hopefully, a nice swimming session will lighten his mood.

Ty stretches before he heads into the water. Once he’s submerged in the water, Ty’s body feels bizarre. Bizarre, but not in a negative way. He’d describe it as if he just drank a cup of coffee to wake him up. Why he feels this way is a mystery to the boy. He’s gone swimming countless times in his life. This isn’t even his first time swimming on the camp’s beach. Today his body feels lighter than usual. He can’t see it, but his body’s now covered in a thin, light blue aura. That’s not the only change. Ty feels physically better, too. His level of mobility is almost as precise as it is on land. The water doesn’t appear to be weighing down his arm and legs like it usually does. Ty feels invigorated right now. Metaphorically speaking, being in the water gives him strength. He’s got much more energy now than he did a few moments ago. 

Maybe this is a sign. He needs more evidence first, but perhaps Ty’s a sea demigod.

1n52w5o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n52w5o,August purchases - Got some long wanted perfumes!,"Shown here are Delina Exclusif by Parfums de Marly, The Matcha 26 by Le Labo, Sensuous Nude by Estée Lauder (discontinued), Tea Escape by MMM Replica (discontinued), and Amore Caffè by Mancera. I posted this but quickly deleted it cause the formatting was wonky. So if you saw that, no you didn’t!

Lately I’ve been looking to expand my collection through second hand means, which can be a little nerve wracking because of the chance of getting ripped off. But perfume as a hobby is crazy expensive, and more savings means more perfumes after all. This month has been one of my more packed perfume hauls!

After monitoring posts on Mercari and on Reddit, I took the plunge on a couple of my long desired fragrances. I finally was able to snag my most desired perfume, MMM Replica’s discontinued Tea Escape.

Three of the perfumes I bought were from Mercari and one was from the subreddit fragranceswap. Also I’ll make sure to explain the notes I smell but sometimes it’s easier to talk about the mood the scent evokes for me.


* First and foremost, Tea Escape. I used to have a little sample that I gave to a friend who was moving away. This was in 2018 and all the years later I would STILL keep thinking of that heavenly perfume. Two years ago I was getting back into perfume as a hobby and was checking out listings on ebay/etsy and it was either new for $400+ or “new” for $60 (completely outside the realm of legitimacy). I debated just buying Armani Privé Thé Yulong.. but it just didn’t hit the same as Tea Escape for me. (Thé Yulong is beautiful though and I have the 50 ml on my list to get). I can’t explain how happy I am to finally have this in my collection again.
     * Well balanced, creamy green tea with white florals, and a little hint of mint. The green tea really shines among the herbal, earthy notes of the mate base (which is not the same as matcha, to me there is no matcha scent in this perfume). Base notes also include milk and rice, which add to the creamy lightness. I read that some say the mint is really prevalent in the opening but that’s never been the case for me, if anything I found it subdued. The osmanthus adds an understated sweetness (and this hard to describe “happy” note) and the jasmine becomes more forward during the dry down, but I never find that it loses its creamy tea identity even to the end. 
     * Overall, I find Tea Escape calming and dreamy, I never get tired of smelling it. This is what I would want you to smell when you enter my house. Been wearing this before sleep and I love waking up to it’s ghost in the morning.
     * Purchased this from Mercari for a very fair deal given what I have been seeing it go for. In fact my search for Tea Escape is what led me to that site, and while it was also rife with fakes, it didn’t seem as bad as ebay or etsy. Easier to find sellers just as passionate about perfume as you the buyer are. It’s too bad because eBay is a more established, global market, with better protection during fraud. But the crackdown on second hand perfume is causing crazy listings there. I read that you may be able to buy used perfume under the Collectibles search, I need to look more into that.

* The second discontinued perfume I got was Sensuous Nude. With this I finally have Sensuous, Sensuous Noir, and now Nude. In my early 20s I used to work for Macy’s and that was the time when I first got serious about perfume collecting and how I came across Sensuous. I bought the OG and Noir, and while I like the OG, I was obsessed with Noir during fall/winter. I used to spray it on my sweaters so I could smell it for DAYS. Fast forward to nowish and I learned about Nude, which I never got to experience. Nude was recommended when learning about the “Your Skin but Better” trend going around.
     * On first spray it is powdery sandalwood, but not overly so. What I really get is beautiful honeyed wood and pink pepper, and the crazy alchemy involved to make it smell like a light and seductive skin scent. The initial burst reminded me of the OG, but oh it becomes its own magic as it goes along and the coconut comes out to play. A nice harmony with the jasmine. I love the pink pepper in this. Well blended and elegant. No one note really overpowers the other, unlike in the OG which is very strong with the sandalwood. This is very much the light to Noir’s spicy dark wood.
     * A lot of times people ask for a coconut scent that isn’t sun lotiony, well here you go. This is a more polished and mature coconut scent. (I’m so sorry it’s discontinued.)
     * I got this for a great price on Mercari. I’ve only had 1 day with this so I’ll need to spend more time with it to really gather my thoughts about it. Also as an aside, the cap on these bottles suck so much.

* When I was checking out the hype with PdM, I started with a decant of Delina. I honestly found it a relief that I didn’t like it. On me, screechy and unpleasant. And yet I had to go and try Exclusif since I saw so many say that while they didn’t care for Delina, they loved the flanker, which is exactly what ended up happening to me. I thought I could be happy with little decants, but I get why you need big bottles of this stuff. Intoxicating, happy juice. Femininity in a bottle. Aphrodite has ten bottles of this on her shelf. As I’m typing this I keep bringing the bottle up to my nose to sniff.
     * One thing that occurred to me while writing these reviews is that I have a fondness for perfumes that can be described as creamy. Exclusif is Delina if you took out the screechiness and made it a creamier, sweeter rose that envelops you like a soft hug but doesn’t overwhelm. Floral lychee blanketed with vanilla. The biggest difference to Delina is how lighter and effervescent Exclusif plays on me. Champagne like. My wallet is happy this doesn’t come as a body cream.
     *Honestly my love for Exclusif is making me want to revisit Delina. I also have La Rosée arriving in a week and excited to try that out. I got this gently used for a great price on r/fragranceswap

* Fall time is almost here and once I put away my ephemeral citrus scents I’ll be needing my beloved fall perfumes. Mancera’s Amore Caffè will be one such perfume. There’s not much to say here other than I bought this as a decant earlier this year and freaking loved it. I love MMM Replica’s Coffee Break but I wanted a perfume that packed more of a coffee punch, and oh boy does this one do just that. I’ll need to have a light hand with this one because it can choke you out if you let it. Radioactively gourmand, and is now probably the most gourmand scent I own.
     * Coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, ice cream, and amaretto. Mix until well combined. Lasts until the heat death of the universe.
     * Got this off Mercari, and was so excited to get this gently used bottle with the original box and inner bag. One of the down sides of buying second hand is usually you don’t get the boxes and accoutrements. Getting it this way felt like I had bought it new. The cap to this bottle is SO nice, satisfying how it snaps on.

* This next one generously came with my purchase of Exclusif, an almost full 15ml mini of Le Labo’s The Matcha 26. I did a little gasp when I saw this was the bonus because it’s the one I’ve been wanting to try out the most from Le Labo. I was surprised by the fig and cedar notes on first spritz. In fact if I were to smell this blind folded I would be surprised to hear the name involved Matcha. Clean and refreshing. Would love this on a dude. Would make a great scent for shaving cream. This is reminding me of a specific product I can’t quite pin down, a mouth wash or maybe a soap? I haven’t spent enough time with it and it’s dry down to get a full picture.

Also this month I bought new O, Unknown! by Imaginary Authors in the 14 ml bottle. This one is being discontinued. I like the notes in it but it is a blind buy, hence why I bought the smaller size.

As for decants, I got 10 ml of Arancia di Capri by Acqua di Parma, D&G’s Light Blue, and Commodity’s Juice Expressive. From my Amore Caffè package I got 5 ml of Commodity’s Velvet and No.14 Icila by Maison Louis Marie. Sensuous Nude came with a 2 ml of Xerjoff’s Groove Xcape.

How was everyone’s August for new to you perfumes? Any good grey market or second hand finds?

Oh almost forgot, the bonus picture is my earring/jewelry case I use as a way to store my little decants bottles. It works great! Credit to the post I saw on here recommending it.",14,1756666659.0,FemFragLab,1,1.0,False
1n52w46,https://www.reddit.com/r/ugly/comments/1n52w46/i_love_to_draw_ugly_people/,I love to draw “ugly” people,"I’m a lurker on this sub. I resonate with a lot of the posts on here despite not being ugly enough to know the true harshness of the experience a physically ugly and unattractive person lives. 

I’m not here to convince anyone into thinking that they are beautiful. The last thing I want to do is invalidate the painful experience of something I can’t imagine is like to live with. 

I’m also not saying that every ugly person lives a painful life, but on this sub, it seems to be a shared experience. 

Anyway, here’s what I wanted to share. Maybe it means something to you, and maybe it doesn’t. 

I like to draw people when I’m out in public like at a café or something. I’m more compelled to draw people that would be considered ugly. 

The weird thing is, I don’t find many people actually ugly. But I’m using that word here because that’s what most of you here identify as. I’ve also never felt a feeling of disgust from looking at a person for their looks alone. 

I don’t seek out only ugly people to draw. But I will always select someone that has features or a facial composition that has more visual interest than a conventionally attractive person that has a very balanced and “predictable” face. 

Maybe it’s a weird artist thing, but I always find something genuinely beautiful in an undeniable way about a person that would otherwise be classified as ugly from first glance. Every time.

When I was in college, I spent many hours in life drawing class. Most of the models were overweight, balding, had scars, large birthmarks, crooked teeth, varied body proportions, over the age of 40, saggy skin, those sort of things associated with ugliness. 

When you look closely at someone like that beautiful features reveal themselves to you. Something like I love how strong of a brow ridge this person has, I love the stark contrast between their skin and their hair, I love the shape of their eyes, or their profile from *this specific angle*. I also start observing weirder stuff like I love the shape of this person‘s ankles, or how their stretchmarks remind me of a white ink neotribal tattoo. I truly love an interesting set of teeth too. 

Again, I’m not trying to convince anybody of anything here. It’s just my opinion, and as a young adult woman I have really surprised myself with the beauty that reveals itself to me in “ugly” people once I start drawing them. There have even been times when I was drawing someone that I would not consider myself attracted to and then after studying their face for a while, my opinion changed for real because I took the time to really observe their features. 

A lot of people might look odd or “ugly” in a snapshot of a moment. When I see people who are ugly in public that I otherwise would not take notice of if I weren’t drawing them, and then I see the way they throw their head back when they’re laughing, or they’re intensely concentrating on something, or they’re wrapping themselves up in their hoodie with their coffee cup to warm up— these things are all very strangely attractive to me. Obviously, not for every single person that is ugly that I have seen. I’m not here to tell you that you’re actually attractive when you’ve lived your whole life knowing that you’re not. But I’m promising you now, people that you would consider on the same level as the expectation of this sub have influenced me before. Maybe I wasn’t attracted to the entirety of the person but certain features or qualities absolutely. 

I have a feeling that somebody might argue and say that if I am anything remotely attractive, and I think that I see an ugly person, and then I find something attractive about them, then they are not truly ugly then. 

If you feel that way, I can’t prove to you anything. I can’t try to convince you that they really would have met your expectation. But I’m sharing how I feel in my experience anyway. If it means something to you then I’m glad I posted it. 

All I’m saying is that I have seen and observed ugly people, and either certain features, mannerisms, or expressions within that person were attractive and charming to me even if it wasn’t their entire physicality. 

Just looking to spread some positivity. Not trying to invalidate or give anyone some toxic false sense of hope or something. Just sharing a story. Have a good day everyone.

1n52vuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1n52vuq/reveal_how_the_bfwood_laundry_stain_brush_handles/,Reveal How the BFWood Laundry Stain Brush Handles Delicates,"It’s not often you come across a product that turns a mundane household chore into something vaguely satisfying, but the BFWood 6341 Laundry Stain Brush surprised me in that department. As someone who battles everything from coffee spills on white shirts to muddy paw prints on the couch, I wasn’t sure if a wooden handle and natural bristles could make all the difference. Spoiler alert: it kind of did. Let me walk you through what it’s like to use this brush on a regular basis.

**Ergonomic Design and Build Quality**  
This laundry stain brush caught my attention immediately with its sleek wooden handle and compact size. Measuring at 6.3 inches long, it’s just the right size for holding comfortably without straining your hand, even during those longer stain-busting sessions. The ergonomic curved design deserves special mention. It fits snugly in my palm, providing a strong yet comfortable grip that allows you to apply more force on those stubborn stains. The boar bristles are soft but sturdy, offering an effective scrub without damaging delicate fabrics. However, I learned the hard way to keep the handle dry during use—wood and water don’t mix well. Letting it air-dry after each use is key to maintaining its longevity.

**Performance and Usability**  
This product really shines when paired with a good spot-remover. From ketchup on my favorite cotton blouse to grass stains on my kids’ soccer uniforms, it worked wonders. The soft bristles are gentle on fabrics, so I didn’t have to worry about pilling or damage, which is something that’s happened before with other stiffer brushes. I tried it on thin knits and heavier materials like denim, and in both cases, it performed admirably. However, I avoided using it on silk and wool, as the manufacturer suggests those materials may not hold up well.

**Strengths**  
- The ergonomic handle provides an excellent grip for effective scrubbing.  
- Soft boar bristles ensure fabrics remain undamaged.  
- Perfect for pre-treating stains on various types of clothing and even furniture.

**Key Benefits**  
The biggest advantage I noticed was how much waste I saved by not throwing away garments due to small, stubborn stains. I’ve had moments where an ugly looking spot made me want to toss something out rather than deal with it, but this brush changed my approach. It actually worked the detergent deeper into the fibers, making the stain remover much more effective. I had a shirt that was sentenced to the back of the closet for years due to a faint wine stain, but a combination of this brush and detergent revived it. For someone with kids who seem to come home with new stains every day, this tool feels like a godsend.

**Areas of Concern**  
- The wooden handle isn’t water-friendly, so it’s essential to avoid soaking it during use.  
- While great for most fabrics, it doesn’t work on wool or silk, which might be a limitation for some users.  
- The size, although excellent for precision, may feel small for anyone tackling larger stain-filled areas.  

**Alternative Products**  
There are plenty of other stain-removal brushes out there, but many tend to come with nylon or synthetic bristles, which can sometimes be harsh on delicate clothing. For example, I tried a plastic-handled brush once that not only failed to get the stains out but also left a mess of frays on my fabric. Compared to that, this natural-bristled alternative feels like a luxury. There is also the Rubbermaid Scrub Brush, which is ideal for tougher fabrics and household surfaces but doesn’t deliver the same precision on delicate items. Some competitors, like the Oxo Good Grips scrub brushes, offer ergonomic designs but seem overengineered for simple laundry needs.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Sure, you could argue a laundry stain brush isn’t a necessity, but if you’re tired of replacing clothes because of unsightly spots, it’s worth the investment. Compared with pricier brushes or chemical-heavy stain removers, this little tool pays for itself by extending the life of your clothing. It’s a great choice for practical, budget-conscious individuals who value quality in their household items.

This script was commissioned by *RedTheFox*! It was a fairly straightforward commission idea, but when I find myself writing the Girlfriend Experience (GFE) stuff, I most certainly do not write it from personal experience (unlike some of my yandere pieces). So I often add fantasy elements, or at least something strange, unexpected or dissonant. But really, it's....it's about distilling an image, a scene I had inside my mind at that point in time.

Huge thanks to Red for giving me the chance to explore that scene, and buying me a coffee to drink whilst I did so.

**SCRIPT:**

*(SFX: Soft rainfall outside the apartment)*

Come on, darling. Let’s get you into bed. Come on.

There we go. Nice and- hey hey hey! Take it easy. Don’t be so hasty, or else you’ll stumble and fall down again.

You really scared me back there, you know? When you blacked out and collapsed on the floor. I was really worried.

(A slightly longer pause)

Why are you apologizing for having a seizure....? (Sighing) You just say the strangest things sometimes. All I’m telling you, is you had me worried. Through no fault of your own.

Well, maybe not letting me come over to take care of you often enough *is* kinda your fault. Have you been eating healthy? Have you been getting enough sleep? Have you been stressing too much over this new job?

Well, honey, the discarded pizza boxes and faint dark circles under your eyes tell a different story. And is that takeout from *The Indian Palace?*

Oh gosh, I love that place too, right? Their butter naan and spicy chicken are simply delish!

Yeah okay, I guess I can cut you some slack on account of your taste in local restaurants. But this- all of this has to go, okay? I’ll be coming over at least twice every week to cook you some proper homemade food. You can’t subsist on microwaved pizza and takeout forever, you know?

Oh, shifts at the hospital keep me busy but I think I can manage to come over at least twice a week for making dinner. It’s sweet of you to ask though. (Muttering softly, playfully) But it kinda makes me think you don’t want me around. (Pouting) Hmph. So mean.

That’s not what it is? Are you sure?

*(SFX: Rustling of blankets)*

Alright then, love. Up on the bed you go. Nice and gentle now.

(Soft, soothing) There we are. Good job. It’s raining quite heavily outside. And the weather’s only getting colder. Let me tuck you in under the blankets.

Mhmn. Pretty sure it’s, like, legally my job to tuck you in under the blankets. Both as a nurse, and as your girlfriend.

What is it, honey? You’ve got a goofy grin on your face.

(Raising an eyebrow) Oh? You’re wondering how did you get so lucky?

Hmm. By flirting with me when you first checked into the hospital for a tetanus shot. Or trying to, at least. You blushed quite deeply after every compliment you gave me. And spoke a bit too fast, like you were afraid I wasn’t interested in listening. And you stuttered over several of your words. And you couldn’t look into my eyes for more than 0.25 seconds at a time before whipping your head back around.

In other words, you were absolutely adorable. I just couldn’t say no to that cute baby face. And those eyes- oh, honey, you simply are too precious for this cruel world!

Hey, are you pouting because I said you have a baby face?

But it’s true, baby. Aww, you’re so cute! Come here. Mwah! (Kissing the listener) Mwwaah! (Silly giggling)

Oh yes, you’re also *very* tough and cool-looking. Especially under those soft baby pink blankets. (Stifling more giggles)

Right, right. You forgot to get them exchanged. I think you should keep these blankets.

Because I like them. These blankets might even, you know....(low, teasing) convince me to get in your bed whenever I come over.

Nope, not cuddling you right now! I have to get you a wet towel. Your forehead’s really warm. You seem to be running a fever. Are you alright?

Okay. Just keep your head still, I’ll be your thrill. (Giggling) Or however that blink-182 song goes.

Come on, it was not that bad! Don’t roll your eyes at me. Just- (another little laugh) just rest your head on the pillow. You can close your eyes. I’ll dim the lights. Don’t worry, I’m right here.

*(SFX: Gentle sloshing sounds of water)*

You think that old lady with the orange cat is trying to peek inside our apartment again?

Huh. You’re right. I don’t see her in the window across the street. Although, it’s hard to tell with the downpour. Water droplets everywhere. For miles and millennia.

You know, I asked about her the other day. Turns out, she’s actually a sweet old woman. She lost her partner to cancer a couple of years ago, you see. I guess, when she sees us, she just....she remembers how things used to be for the two of them. She might just be reliving the past through us.

Yeah. Apparently, it’s just been her and the cat since then.

Oh? You want us to visit her with some cakes and cookies one of these days? *Really?* You, who in my clinical opinion, are probably the most introverted person I’ve ever met?

Well, in my clinical opinion, you’re also the kindest person I’ve ever met. So....so yeah, that checks out. Alright, we’ll pay Mrs. Maisie a visit real soon!

Come now, honey. Of course the towel feels damp on your forehead. Damp, and cool. It’ll help you feel better. Probably. Well, I guess, anyway.

(Laughing softly) I’m just kidding, love. I know what I’m doing. Just relax and let me take care of you, alright?

*(SFX: Rustling of blankets)*

Let me get under these pink blankets with you....(whispering) let me hold you in my arms.

(Softly) Yeah. Just like this.

So, are you going to tell me what has you so stressed at your new job?

Honey. We were about to go out for a movie date, and then you- you lost consciousness and started convulsing. I get the feeling it wasn’t because you were worried I wouldn’t like the film you’ve been raving about lately.

That too? (Rolling her eyes, smiling, sighing softly) Honey. I’d enjoy any movie in the world as long as we watched it together. Worst comes to worst, I’ll just nibble your ears and paw at you throughout the movie until you start paying me attention.

Uh huh. That’s what I’ll do. But stop trying to change the subject, you smooth talker! Tell me what’s wrong.

Are you? Are you really alright?

(A longer pause)

(Sighing) I get it, love. You just joined the firm as a new associate. It’s natural, wanting to do good and make a nice impression. But you mustn’t burn yourself out. Life isn’t a blink-182 song. No. It’s a blink-182 album.

Come on! You know “Enema of the State” was a damn good album. “Going away to college”? “What’s my age again”? “All the small things”? Honey, you can’t just introduce me to these songs and then expect me not to bring them up! But the point, my little windmill, is that life’s not a 100 metre sprint to the finish line. It’s a decades-long journey, and you’re allowed to take it easy at times. To goof off. Take bad decisions. Make mistakes. Fall in love with the wrong kinda girl and then- actually, no, scratch that last part. *You* are not allowed to fall in love with any other girl. (Whispering) You’re mine.

Mhmn. I wouldn’t have it any other way either.

You know, you once told me you found my voice comforting. Felt safe, and secure, whenever I wrapped my arms around you.

Yeah. You said the motion of my breathing, the sound of my heartbeat, always calm you down. Slowly soothe away all your anxiety and negative thoughts. You told me I’m like....like a vision from a fever dream.

I’m glad you scraped your knee against the railway tracks, and had to come to my hospital for a tetanus shot. I’m really glad I met you, got to know you, got to....fall in love with you.

I really wanted to take care of you, so you might watch me and learn from me. Learn how to take good care of yourself, because I won’t always be around.

I’m sorry, honey. I really do love you, but time puts oceans worth of distance between us. I’m....not really here, with you, in this moment. It seems you were being honest with me when you said I brought you comfort and joy.

You’re really sick right now, sweetheart, and your brain is playing old memories. Like a vintage cassette player in an empty, monochrome room. This is your mind’s way of hallucinating in order to heal. Trying to find comfort in memories you hold close to your heart.

You’re having a fever dream, my darling. But don’t you worry. I am with you. Inside your dream. I never stopped caring about you. (Whispering) Never stopped loving you.

I will be with you until you get better. I promise.

(Whispering) I’m not leaving you.

....

*(A long spell of silence. It keeps raining.)*

....

*(SFX: Door gently opening)*

Honey? Where are you?

*(SFX: Door closing)*

I’m so sorry my shift ran late. I called you but you weren’t answering your phone. Did you fall asleep? Are you still in bed?

*(SFX: Soft footsteps)*

Oh, honey. Did I wake you up?

A fever dream.....? Huh. You *are* running a fever, but it’s not as bad as earlier. Still, let me apply a fresh towel.

Oh? You feel better already? But babe, that’s-

(Sighing) Fine. In that case, help yourself to some takeout. I went to *The Indian Palace* again. Your favourite.

How did you get so lucky? (Playful, sighing exaggeratedly) Oh, I don’t know. Guess you wore me down over the years until I finally decided to marry you. Until I, with a heavy heart, decided to let you make me the happiest woman in the world.

Of course I mean it. I still remember that day from 20 years ago, when you strolled into the emergency room, all nonchalant and bleeding from your knees, earphones plugged in and yawning. Like you just wanted to get it over with. You were aura before they invented aura.

Oh yes, you were very cool. Mhmn. And then we met for the first time, and you paused yawning midway through- didn’t think such a thing was even possible- and then, well....

And the rest is history, I guess. Yeah.

Hey, just take it easy, alright? I get it you’re a big shot now. Partner at a big 4. But I’m sure your friends at work can keep the ship sailing until you return.

Well, I compel you to stay in bed and let me take care of you. You can’t refuse. Nurse’s orders.

Oh, it’s a very real thing. And I’m also your wife, so....just cave already! You do want to get better so you can hop around the house and blast old rock music at 7 AM to wake me up and the neighbours every morning, don’t you?

Yeah. That’s what I thought. (Sighing softly) I won’t even hit you with a frying pan this time. (Muttering faintly) Not too hard, anyway....

Hm? You want to know if you’re still my favourite patient?

Well, that’s a difficult one. I’ve had so many curious and interesting patients over the years. Oh, it’s impossible to choose a favourite! But you know what?

You’re certainly my *all-time* favourite!

....yeah okay, that- that’s the same thing. Not sure what I was going for back there. Sorry. Just give me a break, alright? I had a loooong shift! (Breaking into giggles)

(Lingering silence)

So, uh.....you still think of yourself as my patient?

I see. And what’s your sickness, honey?

Being lovesick? Oooof! That- yeah, it’s hard to treat that condition. My condolences, dear patient. Who is it that got you in the end?

*Me?* Really, now?

(Sighing softly) Well, sweetheart, I’m sorry to be the reason you’re so hopelessly in love. I- (stifling giggles)- I never intended for you to be in such a predicament. Oh, honey- how about I give you your meds to help with the....sickness?

(Kissing the listener a few times)

There. (Pecking) All better.

(Smiling) No? That only made you worse?

(Sighing happily) Good.

If it’s me you’re in love with, then I....I hope you never recover. (Whispering) My little windmill.

It is a quiet, leisurely Sunday around these parts and a bit cooler than it has been recently. So I figured why not wear something more relaxed to fit the occasion.

This is a creamy sandalwood fragrance with some spices and coffee mixed in. It smells like an old library or a home built in the 1800s in the best way possible.

Due to the woods, spice, coffee combo, This is 100% a fragrance for men and it is a beast performance-wise. Only a few sprays suffice, and I think it is much better to underspray than to go too heavy.

Really best used in winter, but it works on the right kind of day any time of the year.",6,1756666341.0,GentlemanFragrance,5,1.0,False

  She dreamed of death.  
  
  The dirty red light from the neon sign pulsed against the grimy window like an angry heart. Its flash turned the pools of blood glistening on the floor from dark to bright, dark to bright, slicing the filthy little room into sharp relief, then damning it to shadows.  
  
  She huddled in the corner, a bony girl with a tangle of brown hair and huge eyes the color of the whiskey he drank when he had the money for it. Pain and shock had turned those eyes glassy and blind and her skin the waxy gray of corpses. She stared, hypnotized by the blinking light, the way it blipped over the walls, over the floor. Over him.  
  
  Him, sprawled on the scarred floor, swimming in his own blood.  
  
  Small, feral sounds rumbled in her throat.  
  
  And in her hand the knife was gored to the hilt.  
  
  He was dead. She knew he was dead. She could smell the ripe, hot stink of it pouring out of him to foul the air. She was a child, only a child, but the animal inside her recognized the scent -- both feared it and rejoiced over it.  
  
  Her arm was screaming where he'd snapped the bone. The place between her legs burned and wept from this last rape. Not all the blood splattered over her was his.  
  
  But he was dead. It was over. She was safe.  
  
  Then he turned his head, slowly, like a puppet on a string, and pain washed away in terror.  
  
  His eyes fixed on hers as she babbled, scrambled back deeper into the corner where she'd crawled to escape him. And the dead mouth grinned.  
  
  You'll never be rid of me, little girl. I'm part of you. Always. Inside you. Forever. Now Daddy's going to have to punish you again.  
  
  He pushed to his hands and knees. Blood fell in fat, noisy drops from his face, from his back, slid obscenely from the rips in his arms. When he gained his feet and began to shamble through the flow of blood toward her, she screamed.  
  
  And screaming, woke.  
  
  Eve covered her face with her hands, held one tight over her mouth to hold back the mindless shrieks that tore at her throat like shards of hot glass. Her breath heaved so painfully in her chest she winced with every exhale.  
  
  The fear followed her, breathed cold down her spine, but she beat it back. She wasn't a helpless child any longer, she was a grown woman, a cop who knew how to protect and defend. Even when the victim was herself.  
  
  She wasn't alone in some horrible little hotel room, but in her own house. Roarke's house. Roarke.  
  
  And concentrating on him, on just his name, she began to calm again.  
  
  She'd chosen the sleep chair in her home office because he was off planet. She'd never been able to rest in their bed unless he was with her. The dreams came rarely if at all when he slept beside her, and all too often chased her in sleep when he didn't.  
  
  She hated that area of weakness, of dependence, almost as much as she'd come to love the man.  
  
  Turning in the chair, she comforted herself by gathering up the fat gray cat who curled beside her, watching her out of narrowed, bi-colored eyes. Galahad was accustomed to her nightmares, but he didn't care to be wakened by them at four in the morning.  
  
  ""Sorry,"" she muttered as she rubbed her face against his fur. ""It's so damn stupid. He's dead, and he's not coming back. The dead don't come back."" She sighed and stared into the dark. ""I ought to know.""  
  
  She lived with death, worked with it, waded through it, day after day, night after night. In the final weeks of 2058, guns were banned, and medical science had learned how to prolong life to well beyond the century mark.  
  
  And man had yet to stop killing man.  
  
  It was her job to stand for the dead.  
  
  Rather than risk another trip into nightmares, she ordered the lights on and climbed out of the chair. Her legs were steady enough, and her pulse had leveled to nearly normal. The sick headache that tagged onto the coattails of her nightmares would fade, she reminded herself.  
  
  Hoping for an early breakfast, Galahad leaped off behind her, then ribboned through her legs as she moved into the kitchen area.  
  
  ""Me first, pal."" She programmed the AutoChef for coffee, then set a bowl of kibble on the floor. The cat attacked it as if it were his last meal, and left her to brood out the window.  
  
  Her view was the long sweep of lawn rather than the street, and the sky was empty of traffic. She might have been alone in the city. Privacy and quiet were gifts a man of Roarke's wealth could easily buy. But she knew beyond the beautiful grounds, over the high stone wall, life pumped. And death followed it greedily.  
  
  That was her world, she thought now as she sipped the potent coffee and worked the stiffness of a still-healing wound out of her shoulder. Petty murders, grand schemes, dirty deals, and screaming despair. She knew more of those than of the colorful swirl of money and power that surrounded her husband.  
  
  At times like this, when she was alone, when her spirits were low, she wondered how they had ever come together -- the straight-arrow cop who believed unwaveringly in the lines of the law, and the slick Irishman who'd tangled with and over those lines all of his life.  
  
  Murder had brought them together, two lost souls who'd taken different escape routes to survive and, despite logic and sense, had found each other.  
  
  ""Christ, I miss him. It's ridiculous."" Annoyed with herself, she turned, intending to shower and dress. The blinking light on her tele-link signaled a muted incoming. Without a doubt who was transmitting, she leaped at it and unblocked the silent code.  
  
  Roarke's face popped on screen. Such a face, she thought, watching as he lifted one dark eyebrow. Poetically handsome, with black hair falling long and thick to frame it. The clever, perfectly sculpted mouth, the strong bones, the shocking intensity of brilliant blue eyes.  
  
  After nearly a year, just the sight of that face could send her blood humming.  
  
  ""Darling Eve."" His voice was like cream over strong Irish whiskey. ""Why aren't you sleeping?""  
  
  ""Because I'm awake.""  
  
  She knew what he'd see as he studied her. There was so little she could hide from him. He'd see the shadows of a bad night hounding her eyes, the paleness of her skin. Uncomfortable, she shrugged and pushed a hand through her short, disordered hair. ""I'm going into Cop Central early. I've got paperwork to catch up on.""  
  
  He saw more than she realized. When he looked at her, he saw strength, courage, pain. And a beauty -- in those sharp bones, that full mouth, those steady brandy-colored eyes -- she was delightfully oblivious to. Because he also saw weariness, he changed his plans.  
  
  ""I'll be home tonight.""  
  
  ""I thought you needed a couple of more days up there.""  
  
  ""I'll be home tonight,"" he repeated and smiled at her. ""I miss you, Lieutenant.""  
  
  ""Yeah?"" However foolish she considered the warm thrill, she grinned at him. ""I guess I'll have to make some time for you when you get here.""  
  
  ""Do that.""  
  
  ""Is that why you were calling -- to let me know you'd be back early?""  
  
  Actually, he'd intended to leave a message that he'd be delayed another day or two -- and to try to convince her to join him for the weekend on the Olympus Resort. But he only smiled at her. ""Just wanted to inform my wife of my travel plans. Go back to sleep, Eve.""  
  
  ""Yeah, maybe."" But they both knew she wouldn't. ""I'll see you tonight. Uh, Roarke?""  
  
  ""Yes?""  
  
  She still had to take a bracing breath before she said it. ""I miss you, too."" She cut the transmission even as he smiled at her. Steadier, she took her coffee with her as she went out to prepare for the day. />  
  \* \* \*  
  
  She didn't exactly sneak out of the house, but she was quiet about it. Maybe it was barely five in the morning, but she didn't doubt Summerset was around somewhere. She preferred, whenever possible, to avoid Roarke's sergeant-major -- or whatever term you'd use for a man who knew everything, did everything, and poked his bony nose into what Eve considered her private business entirely too often.  
  
  Since her last case had shoved the two of them closer together than either was comfortable with, she suspected he'd been avoiding her as carefully as she had him for the past couple of weeks.  
  
  Reminded of it, she rubbed a hand absently just under her shoulder. It still troubled her a bit in the morning, or after a long day. Taking a full blast from her own weapon was an experience she didn't want to repeat in this or any other lifetime. Somehow worse was the way Summerset had poured meds down her throat afterward, when she'd been too weak to knock him on his ass.  
  
  She closed the door behind her, took one deep breath of the frigid December air, then cursed viciously.  
  
  She'd left her vehicle at the base of the steps mostly because it drove Summerset crazy. And he'd moved it because it pissed her off. Grumbling because she hadn't bothered to bring along the remote for the garage door or her vehicle, she trooped around the house, boots crunching on frosted grass. The tips of her ears began to sting with cold, her nose to run with it.  
  
  She bared her teeth and punched in the code with gloveless fingers, then stepped into the pristine and blissfully warm garage.  
  
  There were two gleaming levels of cars, bikes, sky-scooters, even a two-passenger mini-copter. Her city-issue vehicle in pea-green looked like a mutt among sleek, glossy hounds. But it was new, she reminded herself as she slid behind the wheel. And everything worked.  
  
  It started like a dream. The engine purred. At her command, the heat began to whir softly through the vents. The cockpit glowed with lights, indicating the initial check run, then the bland voice of the recording assured her all systems were in operational order.  
  
  She'd have suffered the tortures of the damned before she would admit she missed the capriciousness and outright crankiness of her old unit.  
  
  At a smooth pace, she glided out of the garage and down the curved drive toward the iron gates. They parted smoothly, soundlessly, for her.  
  
  The streets in this exclusive neighborhood were quiet, clean. Trees on the verge of the great park were coated in a thin sheen of glittery frost like a skinsuit of diamond dust. Deep inside its shadows, chemi-heads and spine crackers might be finishing up the night's work, but here, there were only polished stone buildings, wide avenues, and the quiet dark before dawn.  
  
  She was blocks away before the first billboard loomed up, spitting garish light and motion into the night. Santa, red-cheeked and with a manic grin that made her think of an oversized elf on Zeus, rode through the sky behind his fleet of reindeer and blasted outho, ho, hos, while warning the populace of just how many shopping days they had left before Christmas.  
  
  ""Yeah, yeah, I hear you. You fat son of a bitch."" She scowled over as she braked for a light. She'd never had to worry about the holiday before. It had just been a matter of finding something ridiculous for Mavis, maybe something edible for Feeney.  
  
  There'd been no one else in her life to wrap gifts for.  
  
  And what the hell did she buy for a man who not only had everything, but owned most of the plants and factories that made it? For a woman who'd prefer a blow with a blunt instrument to shopping for an afternoon, it was a serious dilemma.  
  
  Christmas, she decided, as Santa began to tout the variety of stores and selections in the Big Apple Sky Mall, was a pain in the ass.  
  
  Still, her mood lifted as she hit the predictably snared traffic on Broadway. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, there was a party going on. The people glides were jammed with pedestrians, most of whom were drunk, stoned, or both. Glide-cart operators shivered in the cold while their grills smoked. If a vender had a spot on this street, he held it in a tight, ready fist.  
  
  She cracked her window a sliver, caught the scent of roasting chestnuts, soy dogs, smoke, and humanity. Someone was singing out in a strident monotone about the end of the world. A cabbie blasted his horn well over noise pollution laws as pedestrians flowed into the street on his light. Overhead the early airbuses farted cheerfully, and the first advertising blimps began to hawk the city's wares.  
  
  She watched a fistfight break out between two women. Street LCs, Eve mused. Licensed companions had to guard their turf here as fiercely as the vendors of food and drink. She considered getting out and breaking it up, but the little blonde decked the big redhead, then darted off into the crowd like a rabbit.  
  
  Good thinking, Eve thought approvingly, as the redhead was already on her feet, shaking her head clear and shouting inventive obscenities.  
  
  This, Eve thought with affection, was her New York.  
  
  With some regret, she bumped over to the relative quiet of Seventh, then headed downtown. She needed to get back into action, she thought. The weeks of disability had made her feel edgy and useless. Weak. She'd ditched the recommended last week off, had insisted on taking the required physical.  
  
  And, she knew, had passed it by the skin of her teeth.  
  
  But she'd passed, and was back on the job. Now if she could just convince her commander to get her off desk duty, she'd be a happy woman.  
  
  When her radio sounded, she tuned in with half an ear. She wasn't even on call for another three hours.  
  
  Any units in the vicinity, a 1222 reported at 6843 Seventh Avenue, apartment 18B. No confirmation available. See the man in apartment 2A. Any units in the vicinity.. .  
  
  Eve clicked on before Dispatch could repeat the signal. ""Dispatch, this is Dallas, Lieutenant Eve. I'm two minutes from the Seventh Avenue location. Am responding.""  
  
  Received, Dallas, Lieutenant Eve. Please report status upon arrival.  
  
  ""Affirmative. Dallas out.""  
  
  She glided to the curb, flicked a glance up at the steel-gray building. A few lights glimmered through windows, but she saw only darkness on the eighteenth floor. A 1222 meant there'd been an anonymous call reporting a domestic dispute.  
  
  Eve stepped out of her vehicle, and slid an absent hand over her side where her weapon sat snug. She didn't mind starting out the day with trouble, but there wasn't a cop alive or dead who didn't dread a domestic.  
  
  There seemed to be nothing a husband, wife, or same sex spouse enjoyed more than turning on the poor bastard who tried to keep them from killing each other over the rent money.  
  
  The fact that she'd volunteered to take it was a reflection of her dissatisfaction with her current assignments.  
  
  Eve jogged up the short flight of stairs and looked up the man in 2A.  
  
  She flashed her badge when he spoke through the security peep, shoved it into his beady little eyes when he opened the door a stingy crack. ""You got trouble here?""  
  
  ""I dunno. Cops called me. I'm the manager. I don't know anything.""  
  
  ""I can see that."" He smelled of stale sheets and, inexplicably, of cheese. ""You want to let me into 18B?""  
  
  ""You got a master, don't you?""  
  
  ""Yeah, fine."" She sized him up quickly: short, skinny, smelly, and scared. ""How about filling me in on the occupants before I go in?""  
  
  ""Only one. Woman, single woman. Divorced or something. Keeps to herself.""  
  
  ""Don't they all,"" Eve muttered. ""You got a name on her?""  
  
  ""Hawley. Marianna. About thirty, thirty-five. Nice looker. Been here about six years. No trouble. Look, I didn't hear anything, I didn't see anything. I don't know anything. It's five-fucking-thirty in the morning. She's done any damage to the unit, I want to know about it. Otherwise, it's none of my never-mind.""  
  
  ""Fine,"" Eve said as the door clicked shut in her face. ""Go back to your hole, you little weasel."" She rolled her shoulders once, then walked across the corridor to the elevator. As she stepped inside, she pulled out her communicator. ""Dallas, Lieutenant Eve. I'm at the Seventh Avenue location. Buil  
ding manager is a wash. I'll report back after interviewing Hawley, Marianna, resident of 18B.""  
  
  Do you require backup?  
  
  ""Not at this time. Dallas out.""  
  
  She slipped the communicator back into her pocket as she stepped out into the hallway on eighteen. A quick glimpse up showed her security cameras in place. The hall was church quiet. From the building's location and style, she pegged most of the residents as white collar, middle income. Most wouldn't stir from their beds until after seven. They'd grab their morning coffee, dash out to the airbus or subway stop. More fortunate ones would just plug into the office from their home station.  
  
  Some would have children to see off to school. Others would kiss their spouses good-bye and wait for their lovers.  
  
  Ordinary lives in an ordinary place.  
  
  It flipped through her mind to wonder if Roarke owned the damn building, but she pushed the idea aside and stepped up to 18B.  
  
  The security light was blinking green. Deactivated. Instinctively she stepped to the side of the door as she pushed the buzzer. She couldn't hear its muffled echo and decided the unit was soundproofed. Whatever went on inside, stayed inside. Vaguely annoyed, she took out her master code and bypassed the locks.  
  
  Before entering, she called out. Nothing worse, she mused, than scaring some sleeping civilian into coming at you with a homemade stunner or a kitchen knife.  
  
  ""Ms. Hawley? Police. We have a report of trouble in your unit. Lights,"" she ordered, and the overheads in the living area flashed on.  
  
  It was pretty enough in a quiet way. Soft colors, simple lines. The view screen was programmed to an old video. Two impossibly attractive people were rolling around naked on a bed scattered with rose petals. They moaned theatrically.  
  
  There was a candy dish on the table in front of the long misty-green sofa. It was filled to brimming with sugar-dashed gumdrops. Silver and red candle pillars were grouped beside it, burned artistically down to varying heights.  
  
  The entire room smelled of cranberry and pine.  
  
  She saw where the pine scent originated. A small, perfectly formed tree lay on its side in front of a window. Its festive lights and sweet-faced angel ornaments were smashed, its boughs snapped.  
At least a dozen festively wrapped boxes were crushed under it.  
  
  She reached for her weapon, drew it, and circled the room.  
  
  There was no other obvious sign of violence, not there. The couple on the view screen reached simultaneous climax with throaty, animal moans. Eve sidestepped past it. Listened, listened.  
  
  Heard music. Quiet, cheerful, monotonous. She didn't know the tune, but recognized it as one of the insidious Christmas ditties that played everywhere for weeks during the season.  
  
  She swept her weapon over a short corridor. Two doors, both open. In one she could see a sink, a toilet, the edge of a tub, all in gleaming white. Keeping her back to the wall, she slid toward the second door, where the music played on and on.  
  
  She smelled it, fresh death. Both metallic and fruity. Easing the door all the way open, she found it.  
  
  She moved into the room, swinging right, then left, eyes sharp, ears alert. But she knew she was alone with what had been Marianna Hawley. Still she checked the closet, behind the drapes, then left the room to search the rest of the apartment before she relaxed her guard.  
  
  Only then did she approach the bed.  
  
  2A had been right, she thought. The woman had been a looker. Not stunning, not an eye-popper, but a pretty woman with soft brown hair and deep green eyes. Death hadn't robbed her of that, not yet.  
  
  Her eyes were wide and startled, as the dead's often were. Against the dull pallor of her cheeks careful and subtle color had been applied. Her lashes were darkened, her lips painted a festive cherry red. An ornament had been pinned to her hair just above the right ear -- a small glittery tree with a plump gilded bird on one of its silver branches.  
  
  She was naked but for that and the sparkling silver garland that had been artistically wrapped around her body. Eve wondered, as she studied the raw bruising around the neck, if that was what had been used to strangle her.  
  
  There was more bruising on the wrists, on the ankles, indicating the victim had been bound, and had likely had time to struggle.  
  
  On the entertainment unit beside the bed, the singer suggested she have herself a merry little Christmas.  
  
  Sighing, Eve pulled out her communicator. ""Dispatch, this is Dallas, Lieutenant Eve. I have a homicide.""  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  ""Heck of a way to start the day."" Officer Peabody stifled a yawn and studied the victim with dark cop's eyes. Despite the atrociously early hour, Peabody's uniform was crisp and pressed, her dark brown bowl-cut hair ruthlessly tamed.  
  
  The only thing that indicated she'd been rudely roused out of bed was the sleep crease lining her left cheek.  
  
  ""Heck of a way to end one,"" Eve muttered. ""Prelim on scene indicates death occurred at twenty-four hundred hours, almost to the minute."" She shifted aside to let the team from the Medical Examiner's office verify her findings. ""Indications are cause of death was strangulation. The lack of defensive wounds further indicate the victim didn't struggle until after she was bound.""  
  
  Gently, Eve lifted the dead woman's left ankle and examined the raw skin. ""Vaginal and anal bruising indicate she was sexually molested before she was killed. The unit's soundproofed. She could have screamed her lungs out.""  
  
  ""I didn't see any signs of forced entry, no signs of struggle in the living area except for the Christmas tree. That looked deliberate to me.""  
  
  Eve nodded, slanted Peabody a look. ""Good eye. See the man in 2A, Peabody, and get the security discs for this floor. Let's see who came calling.""  
  
  ""Right away.""  
  
  ""Set a couple of uniforms on the door-to-door,"" Eve added as she walked over to the tele-link by the side of the bed. ""Somebody turn that damn music off.""  
  
  ""You don't sound like you're in the holiday spirit."" Peabody hit the off button on the sound system with a clear sealed finger. ""Sir.""  
  
  ""Christmas is a pain in the ass. You finished here?"" she demanded of the ME's team. ""Let's turn her over before she's bagged.""  
  
  The blood had found its lowest level, settling in the buttocks and turning them a sickly red. Bowel and bladder had emptied, the waste of death. Through the seal coat on her hands, Eve felt the waxy-doll texture of the skin.  
  
  ""This looks fresh,"" she murmured. ""Peabody, get this on video before you go down."" Eve studied the bright tattoo on the right shoulder blade as Peabody moved in to document it.  
  
  ""My True Love."" Peabody pursed her lips over the bright red letters that flowed in old-fashioned script over the white flesh.  
  
  ""Looks like a temporary to me."" Eve bent lower until her nose all but brushed the curve of shoulder, sniffed. ""Recently applied. We'll check where she gets body work done.""  
  
  ""Partridge in a pear tree.""  
  
  Eve straightened, lifted a brow at her aide. ""What?""  
  
  ""In her hair, the pin in her hair. On the first day of Christmas."" Because Eve continued to look blank, Peabody shook her head. ""It's an old Christmas song, Lieutenant. The Twelve Days of Christmas.' The guy gives his true love something on every day, starting with a partridge in a pear tree on the first day.""  
  
  ""What the hell is anybody supposed to do with a bird in a tree? Stupid gift."" But a sick suspicion churned in her gut. ""Let's hope this was his only true love. Get me those tapes. Bag her,"" she ordered, then turned once more to the bedside 'link.  
  
  While the body was being removed, she ordered all incoming and outgoing transmissions for the previous twenty-four hours.  
  
  The first came in at just past eighteen hundred hours -- a cheerful conversation between the victim and her mother. As Eve listened, studied the mother's laughing face, she thought of how that same face would look when she called and told the woman her daughter was dead.  
  
  The only other transmission was an outgoing. Good-looking guy, Eve mused as she studied the image on screen. Mid-thirties, quick smile, soulful brown eyes. Jerry, the victim called him. Or Jer. Lots of sexual by-play, teasing. A lover then. Maybe her true love.  
  
  Eve removed the disc, sealed it, and slipped it into her bag. She located Marianna's daybook, porta-'link, and address book in the desk under the window. A quick scroll through the entries netted her one Jeremy Vandoren.  
  
  Alone now, Eve turned back to the bed. Stained sheets were tangled at the foot. The clothes that had been carefully cut off the victim and tossed to the floor were bagged for evidence. The apartment was silent.  
  
  She let him in, Eve mused. Opened the door to him. Did she come in here with him voluntarily, or did he subdue her first? The tox report would tell her if there were any illegals in the bloodstream.  
  
  Once he had her in the bedroom, he tied her. Hands and feet, likely hooking the restraints' around the short stump of post at each of the four corners, spreading her out like a banquet.  
  
  Then he'd cut off her clothes. Carefully, no hurry. It hadn't been rage or fury or even a desperate kind of need. Calculated, planned, ordered. Then he'd raped her, sodomized her, because he could. He had the power.  
  
  She'd struggled, cried out, probably begged. He'd enjoyed that, fed on that. Rapists did, she thought, and took several deep, steadying breaths because her mind wanted to veer toward her father.  
  
  When he was done, he'd strangled her, watching, watching while her eyes bulged. Then he'd brushed her hair, painted her face, draped her in festive silver garland. Had he brought the hairpin with him, or had it belonged to her? Had she amused herself with the tattoo, or had he decorated her body himself?  
  
  She moved into the neighboring bathroom. White tile sparkled like ice, and there was a faint under-scent of disinfectant.  
  
  He cleaned up here when he was finished, Eve decided. Washing himself, even grooming, then wiping down and spraying the room to remove any evidence.  
  
  Well, she'd put the sweepers on it in any case. One lousy pubic hair could hang him.  
  
  She'd had a mother who loved her, Eve thought. One who'd laughed with her, making holiday plans, talking about sugar cookies.  
  
  ""Sir? Lieutenant?""  
  
  Eve glanced over her shoulder, saw Peabody in the center of the hallway. ""What?""  
  
  ""I ha  
ve the security discs. Two uniforms are initiating door-to-doors.""  
  
  ""Okay."" Eve rubbed her hands over her face. ""Let's seal the place up, take everything to Central. I have to inform the next of kin."" She shouldered her bag, picked up her field kit. ""You're right, Peabody. It's a heck of a way to start the day.""  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  ""Did you run the 'link number on the boyfriend?""  
  
  ""Yes, sir. Jeremy Vandoren, lives on Second Avenue, he's an account exec for Foster, Bride and Rumsey on Wall Street."" Peabody glanced at her notebook as she relayed the rest. ""Divorced, currently single, thirty-six. And a very attractive specimen of the male species. Sir.""  
  
  ""Hmm."" Eve slipped the security disc into her desk unit. ""Let's see if the very attractive specimen paid a call on his girlfriend last night.""  
  
  ""Can I get you some coffee, Lieutenant?""  
  
  ""What?""  
  
  ""Can I get you some coffee?""  
  
  Eve's eyes narrowed as she scanned the video. ""If you want coffee, Peabody, just say so.""  
  
  Behind Eve's back, Peabody rolled her eyes. ""I want coffee.""  
  
  ""Then get some -- and get some for me while you're at it. Victim arriving home at sixteen forty-five. Pause disc,"" Eve ordered and took a good look at Marianna Hawley.  
  
  Trim, pretty, young, her shining brown hair covered with a bright red beret that matched the long swirl of her coat and the slick shine of her boots.  
  
  ""She'd been shopping,"" Peabody commented as she set the mug of coffee at Eve's elbow.  
  
  ""Yeah. Bloomingdale's. Continue scan,"" Eve said and watched as Marianna shifted her bags, dug out her key card. Her mouth was moving, Eve noted. Talking to herself. No, she realized, Marianna was singing. Then the woman shook back her hair, shifted her bags once again, stepped inside the apartment, and shut the door.  
  
  The red lock light blinked on.  
  
  As the disc continued, Eve saw other tenants coming and going, alone, in couples. Ordinary lives, moving forward.  
  
  ""She stayed in for dinner,"" Eve stated, looking now with her mind's eye, through the door, inside the apartment.  
  
  She could see Marianna moving around the rooms, wearing the simple navy slacks and white sweater that would later be cut from her body.  
  
  Turn the viewing screen on for company. Hang up the bright red coat in the front closet, put the hat on the shelf, the boots on the floor. Tuck away the shopping bags.  
  
  She was a tidy woman who liked pretty things, preparing for a quiet evening at home.  
  
  ""Fixed herself some soup at about seven, according to her AutoChef."" Eve drummed short, unpainted nails on the desk as she continued the scan. ""Her mother called, then she called the boyfriend.""  
  
  While she clicked off the time frame in her mind, she saw the elevator doors open. Her brows winged up, disappearing under the fringe of bangs on her forehead. ""Well, ho ho ho, what have we here?""  
  
  ""Santa Claus."" Grinning, Peabody leaned over Eve's shoulder. ""Bearing gifts.""  
  
  The man in the red suit and snowy white beard carried a large box wrapped in silver paper and trimmed with an elaborate bow of gold and green.  
  
  ""Hold it. Pause. Enlarge sector ten through fifty, thirty percent.""  
  
  The screen shifted, the section Eve designated separating, then popping out. Nestled in the center of the fancy bow was a silver tree with a plump gilded bird.  
  
  ""Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch, that's the thing that was in her hair.""  
  
  ""But... that's Santa Claus.""  
  
  ""Get a grip on yourself, Peabody. Continue scan. He's going to her door,"" Eve muttered, watching as the cheerful figure carried his glossy burden to Marianna's apartment. He pressed her buzzer with a gloved finger, waited a beat, then threw back his head and laughed. Almost instantly, Marianna opened the door, her face glowing, her eyes sparkling with delight.  
  
  She scooped back her hair with one hand, then opened the door wider in invitation.  
  
  Santa tossed one quick glance over his shoulder, looked directly at the camera. Smiled, winked.  
  
  ""Freeze video. The bastard. Cocky bastard. Print hard copy of image on screen,"" she ordered while studying the round, ruddy-cheeked face and sparkling blue eyes. ""He knew we'd view the discs, see him. He's enjoying it.""  
  
  ""He dressed up as Santa."" Peabody continued to gape at the screen. ""That's disgusting. That's just... wrong.""  
  
  ""What? If he'd dressed up as Satan it would have been more appropriate?""  
  
  ""Yes -- no."" Peabody moved her shoulders, shuffled her feet. ""It's just... well, it's really sick.""  
  
  ""It's also really smart."" Eyes flat, Eve waited while the image printed out. ""Who's going to shut the door in Santa's face? Continue scan.""  
  
  The door closed behind them, and the hallway remained empty.  
  
  The timer running along the bottom of the screen marked at twenty-one thirty-three.  
  
  So, he took his time, Eve mused, nearly two and a half hours. The rope he'd used to tie her, and anything else he might have needed, would have been in that big shiny box.  
  
  At eleven, a couple got off the elevator, laughing, a little drunk, arm in arm as they passed Marianna's door. Oblivious to what was going on inside.  
  
  Fear and pain.  
  
  Murder.  
  
  The door opened at half past midnight. The man in the red suit stepped out, still carrying his silver box, a smile wide, almost fierce, on his red-cheeked face. Once more he looked directly at the camera, and now there was madness glowing in his eyes.  
  
  He was dancing as he got on the elevator.  
  
  ""Copy disc to file Hawley. Case number 25176-H. How many days of Christmas did you say there were, Peabody? In the song?""  
  
  ""Twelve."" Peabody soothed her dry throat with coffee. ""Twelve days.""  
  
  ""We'd better find out if Hawley was his true love, or if he has eleven more."" She rose. ""Let's talk to the boyfriend.""  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Jeremy Vandoren worked inside a small box in a hive of small boxes. His stingy cubicle held a workstation just big enough to accommodate his computer and phone system and a three-wheeled chair. Pinned to the flimsy walls were printouts of stock reports, a theater schedule, a Christmas card showcasing a well-endowed woman wearing strategically placed snowflakes, and a photo of Marianna Hawley.  
  
  He barely glanced up when Eve stepped inside; he held up a hand to hold her off and continued to work the keyboard of his computer manually while talking rapidly into a headset.  
  
  ""Comstat's at five and an eighth, Kenmart's down three and three-quarters. No, Roarke Industries just took a leap up six points. Our analysts look for it to go up another two by end of day.""  
  
  Eve raised a brow and tucked her hands in the pockets of her trousers. She was standing here waiting to talk murder, and Roarke was making millions.  
  
  It was just weird.  
  
  ""Done."" Vandoren hit another key and had a tangle of mysterious figures and symbols swimming onto the screen. She let him fiddle another thirty seconds, then pulled her badge out of her pocket and held it in front of his face.  
  
  He blinked twice, then turned and focused on her. ""I've got that. You're set. Absolutely. Thanks."" With a puzzled smile -- slightly nervous around the edges -- Vandoren swiveled the mike of his headset to the side. ""Um, Lieutenant, what can I do for you?""  
  
  ""Jeremy Vandoren?""  
  
  ""Yeah."" His deep brown eyes slid past her, brushed over Peabody, then slid back. ""Am I in trouble?""  
  
  ""Have you done something illegal, Mr. Vandoren?""  
  
  ""Not that I can remember."" He tried a smile again, bringing a small dimple to life at the corner of his mouth. ""Not unless that candy bar I stole when I was eight's come back to haunt me.""  
  
  ""Do you know Marianna Hawley?""  
  
  ""Marianna, sure. Don't tell me Mari's nicked a candy bar."" Then abruptly, like a light winking off, the smile disappeared. ""What is it? Has something happened? Is she all right?""  
  
  He was out of his chair, his eyes scanning over the top of the cubicle as if he expected to see her.  
  
  ""Mr. Vandoren, I'm sorry."" Eve had never found a good way to relay the news, so she settled on relay  
ing it quickly. ""Ms. Hawley is dead.""  
  
  ""No, she's not. No,"" he said again, turning those dark eyes back to Eve. ""She's not. That's ridiculous. I just talked to her last night. We're meeting for dinner at seven. She's fine. You've made a mistake.""  
  
  ""There's no mistake. I'm sorry,"" she repeated as he only continued to stare at her. ""Marianna Hawley was murdered last night in her apartment.""  
  
  ""Marianna? Murdered?"" He continued to shake his head slowly, as if the two words were foreign. ""That's definitely wrong. That's just wrong."" He whirled around, fumbled to his desk 'link. ""I'll call her right now. She's at work.""  
  
  ""Mr. Vandoren."" Eve put a firm hand on his shoulder and nudged him into his chair. There was no place for her to sit, so she eased a hip on the desk so their faces could be more on level. ""She's been identified through fingerprints and DNA. If you can manage it, I'd like you to come with me and do a visual confirmation.""  
  
  ""A visual..."" He sprang up again, his elbow rapping Eve's shoulder and causing the still healing wound to sing. ""Yeah, I'll come with you. Damn right I will. Because it's not her. It's not Marianna.""  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  The morgue was never a cheerful place. The fact that someone in either an optimistic or macabre frame of mind had hung red and green balls from the ceiling and draped ugly gold tinsel around the doorways only succeeded in added a kind of smirking grin over death.  
  
  Eve stood at the viewing window as she had stood too many times before. And she felt, as she had felt too many times before, the hard jerk of shock punch through the man beside her as he saw Marianna Hawley lying on the other side of the glass.  
  
  The sheet that covered her to the chin would have been hastily draped. To hide from friends, family, and loved ones the pitiful nakedness of the dead, the slices in the flesh left by the Y incision, the temporary stamp on the instep that gave that body a name and number.  
  
  ""No."" In a helpless gesture, Vandoren pressed both hands to the barrier. ""No, no, no, this can't be right. Marianna.",1,1756666339.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

After I got a depression and psycho problems my relation broke up. (This is a few months ago), the depression was very messy but I can say that I’m good now. 
Now I’m not literally searching for someone but after moving back to my birthplace I’m sometimes on dating apps like tinder and Facebook dating. Now I matched a woman on Facebook dating, and were getting to know each other. She has also a depression and we can really talk about it with a feeling of understanding. 
I said to her that I don’t know anything anymore about going out in this city and she said that if she didn’t had her children at home that she would take me out. 
I said to her that there will be more party’s and as answer she said that coffee is also fine. Is this an invitation or asking me to move on her?

1n52pfp,https://i.redd.it/kdgvynuvdemf1.png,PASSEDDDDDDDDDD PMP,"GUYSSS.. I IDD ITTT!!! someone with ADHD - I am still in shock.. like how hahah!! I took the exam yesterday from home and honestly midway the exam I thought I am done I am not going to pass this.. but here we are!!! Our mind is always trying to challenge us.

my first post on this group last year was what is PMP - I had 0 knowledge about it and was exposed to this only when I started my post-graduation diploma in Project Management. The course was ok - but a lot of it was self study - so here I am to pass it to the people who are still contemplating if they are ready or not!

THIS GROUP IS GOLD! you all deserve a pat on your back to be so supportive! I have friends and family who did the exam but they would never tell me the exact things or just answered in yes/no.. I feel Strangers have helped me more in my journey!

about the online exam - really simple process when you pay for the exam - 

1. you need to go on pearson vue link login with PMI credentials

2. select online or in-person

3. Calendar option - also allows to see different timing for the same day - I booked mine from 15:45.

4. Once booked - it gives you the option to run a system check to make sure everything is in order ( I did this immediately, did not wait till exam date). I work in IT and had lot of remote connections tools which I had to uninstall.

5. on the day of the exam - in the same booking email - there is link which gets activated 30mins before the exam that you need to access - once accessed it does the same system run check - then it give you a message or QR option to scan from phone to upload your setup pictures.

6. Once uploaded - I was waiting for proctor to connect - he connected - again asked me to show setup - I had a clear water bottle - I had a coffee with me - he asked where my phone is  -  checked corners of the table - below the table. that's all. And I started the exam - midway I was reading little loudly so I got a prompt on screen to not read loudly.

About the Actual Exam - 

1) No EVM for me - 1 PERT question - 2 Drag and Drop - roughly 10-12 multiple select and 1 burnup chart 

2) I won't say it was heavy on Agile - I feel every section of 60 questions had equal hybrid, traditional and AGile.

3) I was tired after a point - I took both my 10 min break - used the washroom - had water and coffee.

4) I flagged hardly 3 to 4 questions in each section and did review - at the end I had 7mins left and I had given up by this point and just submitted!

  
Resources I would suggest using -

1) AR's Udemy course for sure - I like the way he explains. I used this course only for traditional projects though. I didn't study much on Agile as in June I did my Scrum Master Certification so I understood Agile better then.

2) David McLachlan's Process Group video on youtube - the quick overview one with ITTO's

3) MR's Mindset video, AR's 200 Ultra hard questions

4) I bought the thirdrock cheat sheet - but didn't read much - I can't read a lot, I am more of a listener - but great content!

5) Lastly - I like Agile - so I made this study as an Agile Project - I used lot of sticky notes in my room - my washroom - I wrote the process groups on big charts - stuck one on my fridge - one in my washroom - so everytime I see it - I retained info - wrote all formulas, definitions, Leadership styles and theories - everything Visual.

6) pls note like I mentioned I studied post-grad diploma in project management - so we worked on lot of assignments which also helped me retain info - we created Project Mgt Plans, QMP, RMP, Procurement Plan.. all of it.

7) Biggest saviour and everyone shd use this - PMI Study hall Plus - last week of study was just mocks and mini exams! the first mock I took it took me 2 days because I kept pausing it.. and then slowly I kept practising.

Out of all the mocks I have done - Study Hall is the only one I feel was similar to the actual exam.

so do lot of mocks, mocks, mocks and Mindset is must - helped me eliminate negative answers immediately - but the remaining 2 were so similar had to go back and read the question again what are we solving here!

One day before the exam I started doubting my prep - I did mini exams and I made super silly mistakes - so I told myself I tried! I did all I can - now I just have to attempt - I was ready to fail too - you won't know till you actually give it!

In 2023 I booked a trip to Portugal and said screw it, I’m going to drag my bike along and ride from town to town instead of taking the bus/train. It was seriously the most fun I’ve ever had. I’ve tried to do a couple of my old style bikepacking trips since then and I always end up riding most of the day and just going back my truck and going home. Touring is so much fun because you’re constantly going through small towns or villages where there’s stuff to see and people to talk to, you’re riding all day but you can stop in a cafe and eat or have a coffee while also covering a good amount of mileage for the day… with my bikepacking trips it’s just the riding. They’re remote so there isn’t much to see and I guess touring made me realize that it’s kind of boring? Beautiful landscapes are always a nice thing but you also get those on a tour if you plan it right. 



Has this happened to anyone else? I’m not mad about it at all, im so happy that I’ve found touring. My mountain bike strictly gets used for trail riding now which is fine by me.",66,1756666084.0,bicycletouring,34,0.95,False

Hi everyone! Pardon the double post today, but after my [Magic Number Check-In Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/valkyries/comments/1n4ymec/magic_number_checkin_831/) this morning I had enough coffee and free time to clean up one of my spreadsheets into a proper Stretch Run Calculator.

That means all of you can enjoy your speculative exercises now! Just go to the file menu and making a copy of it over to your own google drive and then edit the drop downs (column K) to see what any set of outcomes do to the standings.

I'll do a daily and clone a tab to incorporate the results each day through the end of the season.

Enjoy!

I’m a fun and adventurous guy seeking a Dominant woman who is interested in a Female Led Relationship.

I’m 35, 5’11”, I live an active lifestyle, a bit nerdy, and can be a bit shy when first meeting people.

In my Vanilla life, I have my life together and work a full time job in Tech. On my free time, I love making art, playing video/board games, planning out travel trips, concerts, and hanging out with friends.

In the bdsm world, I’d love to find a dominant to serve. I love the rituals, giving up controls, and focusing entirely on my partner. I enjoy being caged, love bondage, following directions, pegging, body worship, and humiliation. I’m not into findom and am not interested in pro-dommes. I would like to develop a meaningful relationship with a power dynamic involved. I hope to meet a goddess to serve soon!

Part Two

*NORMAN*

The department has never been this inactive. I’ve been here for thirty one years now. No wait… thirty THREE. Has it been that long? 

Not a single call from behind the wall. Not a single reduction. Not a single thing to do but sit in front of our monitors and watch everything happen. Watching the whole thing unravel. I can’t say that I’m sad to see it. It’s the first day in all my years at City Hall where I don’t have to smile. 

Have I even smiled today? I don’t know. Wait a minute. Yes, I have.

I smiled at Shelby a few times. Adorable little girl. It’s her first day. 

What a day. 

I look at the back of the room and I see her sitting by herself at Aaron’s old station. She looks lonely and confused. Poor girl. She’s been watching a few outdated tutorials on how to use the system and answer calls. I don’t have anyone to train her today. I look at the empty station next to her and I think about Simon. I think about having to smile at him for years and give him pats on the back for his productivity. I think about how much he truly enjoyed his station. I think about how disgusting he was in every way. Then I think about how it all ended for him.

Now I’m smiling.

No. No. No. Don’t do that Norman!  

*“Don’t let it in. You do what you have to do to survive, you pretend on the outside, but you don’t let it change you inside.”*

I won’t, Mom. I promise.

After another quick glance around the room and I’m sure no one can see what I’m watching, I play the video on my monitor again for what has to be the twentieth time.

Maybe more. 

I take it back. 

I’ve smiled quite a bit today. This is the best feed I have ever seen on this screen.

Aaron is standing in the crowded plaza of the Manufacturing District while a killer creeps closer and closer towards him. Hundreds of people who have been beaten down by the rule of Consensus are on their knees, but he’s standing. Putting himself between a woman and a monster. Aaron doesn’t flinch. He doesn’t back down. He bangs that blade against some kind of pry bar and he inspires everyone to rise up and fight back.

I swear, the video gets better every time I play it! I hope he’s okay out there. I hope he gets away. Such a nice boy.

When the feed was live this morning, everybody gasped and cursed their former coworker. I had to hide what I was feeling. Nothing new there I guess. But I let something in I probably shouldn’t have. Hope. The hope that everything was about to change for the better. 

Haven’t felt that in a long time!

I pause the video and look over the room at all of the faces that are glued to their screens. 

It’s not real to any of them. There’s no consequences. I thought that maybe watching Simon die the way he did might have changed things for them. Made it more real, I guess. 

Nope. 

Wishful thinking.

For them, today is just another day of watching things happen that are far, far away from their comfortable lives. It’s just another day in Department 49. I’m sure they expect to end their shifts and go home like they’ve always done and come back in the morning to business as usual. The system is all they’ve ever known and they’ve all been taught that nothing will ever change.

They watch the people behind the wall fighting back.

They cheer when the Bishops or Clerks make some kind of advance and their faces fall when it goes the other way. Back and forth all day.

Back and forth.

They talk to each other over their stations. They make bets on how long the uprising will last. They make bets on how many casualties there will be.

It’s all some kind of a sick game. It’s always been that way in this department.

The door flies open and a worker from another department lets everyone know that the Red Bishop and the little girl have been caught and they’re about to be escorted through the front doors of City Hall.

Everyone runs out of the room and piles into the great hall. Shelby doesn’t know what to do, so she sits still. Poor girl. I can tell she doesn’t want to follow the crowd, and it makes me smile. She hasn’t been ruined by the system yet.

She doesn’t have to be.

“Shelby! Shelby?! Why don’t you come up here with me!” I keep my voice as cheerful as I can and I roll another chair over to my station. She walks to the front of the room with her shoulders up and her arms folded. “Here! Come on over. Trust me, you don’t want to go out there with the rest of them. Have a seat.”

“Thank you.” 

“Would you like a pastry or some coffee?”

“No, thank you.” Her voice is so quiet. She’s about to turn eighteen. She was originally assigned to Department 34, power and water systems. But after the exits of Simon and Aaron, the system had decided she was the best candidate to make up for the losses in Department 49 seeing as how she had no previous training in any other department. 

“So… kind of a strange first day isn’t it?”

“Yes sir.”

“Oh, come on now. You don’t have to call me sir. Call me Norman.” 

The door to the department is cracked and we can hear everyone in the hallway spitting and cursing at the Red Bishop and the little girl. I wince at some of the things being said.

“Well listen Shelby, why don’t we…”

“Norman?”

“Yes?”

“What’s going to happen?” She’s scared. “Does stuff like this happen all the time?”

“No no no no. This is definitely the rarest of occurrences.”

“What happens if they get out, the things behind the wall?” I think about her question and my mind goes towards what I should say, but I can’t force myself to stick with the scripted responses anymore. It’s all coming apart and to me, there seems to be no sense in lying about it. For the first time I’m going to do it. For the first time, I’m going to be honest. I almost did with Aaron, but I was too much of a coward to say what I really wanted to say to him. I gave him a cryptic little warning instead, and for the last few days I’ve been ashamed of myself for not saying the things I should have said.

Maybe I could have helped him more if I had.

“Let me show you something.” I punch up a camera feed behind the wall. It shows the inside of the lobby of the hospital in the Central District. We both watch the chaotic scene in the hospital. People are screaming. Doctors and nurses are running back and forth. People carrying in more and more of the wounded. “Looks terrible in there, yeah? So much pain, but, if you really look closely, you’ll see something else. Look at them helping each other, Shelby. Look at how much those people care. They’re trying to save each other. They’re not things.” She looks up at me. She’s never heard anyone talk like this. “They’re people. They’re nothing to be afraid of. No matter what happens today or tomorrow, it’s all going to be alright. Trust me.”

I can tell she’s shocked by what I’ve said. There’s no suspicion in her expression and she smiles at me.

“Okay.”

“What do you say, you just stay up here with me and we’ll ride it out together. Okay?”

“Okay.”

Everyone files back into the department and immediately goes back to their screens and I pull up another tutorial for Shelby on my monitor and as she watches the screen, I watch her face. She’s so young. Innocent. Maybe she won’t have to live a life like I’ve had. I can barely remember how I used to be before I came here. 

I drift off and think about my first day at City Hall.

I think about my mum.

\-

She adjusts my tie, and when she does, she sees the little spot of grease that was behind it.

“Norman, what is this?”

“Butter from the toast.” She caught me. I push my shoulders up and my face scrunches up. She smiles back at me.

“Do you have any other shirts that are clean?”

“No.”

“Norman, you’re fifteen. You have to stop eating like you haven’t had a bite in a year and you have to start making sure your clothes are clean.”

“I know. I’m sorry.” 

“Honestly, I have no idea how you stay so skinny.” She sighs and moves the tie back to where I had it, covering the stain. It’s a little crooked, but I don’t think anyone other than my mother would even notice. She looks me up and down.

“My little man.” There’s tears in her eyes. “How are you feeling?”

“I’m really nervous.”

“I know. No matter what happens today, you’re going to come home and everything is going to be alright.”

“Okay.”

“Now… let me see that smile. Good.” She’s always asking me to smile. She’s always said that if I keep a smile on my face, everything will go my way. “Never stop smiling. No matter what they tell you and no matter what happens. Whatever they ask you to do, you just keep smiling. Do you understand?”

“Yes, Mum.”

“I’ll walk you outside.” 

The air is warm and breezy. I can smell the ocean and if I was to take some time to really listen, I’ll bet I could hear the sea lions barking like mad. All the kids from our little apartment building are out in force, enjoying their freedom. School ended for the summer just a week ago and this is the first time I’m not going to be out here like them. Today is the first day I report to my station at City Hall. My mum points up at The Tower, the tallest building in the whole city where all of The Founders live.

“Look at it, Norman. Someday, you could live there, but you have to play the game.”

“Okay.” She puts her arms on my shoulders.

“Now. Who do we trust?”

“Each other.”

“Who do we not trust?”

“Everyone else.”

“Good. You’re going to have to be careful. You’re a sweet boy, and sweet boys get taken advantage of. Our lives here are possible because we stay in our place. As long as we keep our heads down and do what we’re told, we’ll never have to leave. I have done a lot of things I’m not proud of to make sure you’re safe here and not behind that horrible wall. You are the best young man I have ever known, and now it’s your turn to make sure that you stay here, in this city.”

“Okay.”

“Do you really understand what I’m telling you?”

“I think so.”

“You’re going to hear a lot of things that are bad, okay? You might have to… you’re going to have to do a lot of things that…um…” She clears her throat and looks away from me for a second. She’s trying not to cry. 

“It’s okay, Mum.” She smiles at me and takes a deep breath. 

“You’re gonna have to do things that are bad, whether you want to or not, but you do what you have to do so you don’t get in trouble. The only thing that’s important is that you make sure you come home every night.”

“I will.”

“Everyone in this city is sick, but they don’t know it. If you’re not careful, the sickness that they have can infect you. You DO NOT let that happen. No matter what. Do you understand?”

“Yes, Mum.”

“Don’t let it in. You do what you have to do to survive, you pretend on the outside, but you don’t let it change you inside.”

“Okay.”

She adjusts my hair and looks me up and down one more time before she hugs me. She whispers in my ear.

“Now, what are those things behind the wall?”

“People.”

“But we don’t call them that outside of this home, do we?”

“No.”

“What do we call them?”

“Chattle.”

“Good. Now be on your way.”

\-

My station is a nightmare. The man in charge of the department was very nice while he described my job. Once he finished telling me that my entire function at City Hall was convincing unproductive people to kill themselves, he had me watch a bunch of videos describing how the system works. I started to think it was all some kind of joke until I was put with another technician and I watched him work on “reductions” for the last four hours of my shift. 

I kept quiet the whole time. I kept smiling.

I had no idea what my station was going to be until today, and now that I know, I want to run out of the building. But I can’t run. I have to report to the office of the man who runs this place.

My supervisor insisted that I perform one “reduction” before I left for the day, but I just couldn’t do it, and now I’m standing in front of a large wooden door.

Keep smiling, Norman.

I knock.

“Come in.” When I open the door, I see two men. One is in a wheelchair and one is sitting behind a large desk. The man behind the desk looks at a datapad. “Norman, is it?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Have a seat, Norman.” The black leather chair in front of the desk is big and poofy, and when I sit down, I’m looking up at both of them. I feel so small. The man in the wheelchair stares at me, but he doesn’t say a word. He doesn’t seem very pleasant at all and he kind of looks like an angry rodent. “Fifteen? Norman, we know we’re at the bottom of the barrel when we don’t have anyone older than fifteen to fill a station. My name is Silas, and I run everything you see.”

“It’s very nice to meet you sir.” I keep smiling, just like my mother told me.

“Do you know why your supervisor sent you in here?”

“I believe it was for how I handled my first call sir.”

“And would you care to explain to me exactly how you conducted yourself during that call?” He seems very friendly. He’s all smiles as well.

“I tried to help her, sir.”

“And why would you do that?”

“Well, it was a ten year old girl, sir. She’s just feeling terrible about reporting on her parents' activities. You see, she thought they were only going to be reprimanded or warned about their extreme behaviour.”

“And what was their behaviour, Norman? Explain it to me as if I have no idea what goes on in my own system.” His voice is lowered. His smile is gone. He looks just as angry as the rodent-man.

Just keep smiling, Norman. Don’t let him know that he’s scaring you.

“Um, well…they had a book… and they showed it to her and… they began to teach her about a religion that…”

“Stop right there!” The man called Silas slams his fist on his desk and I jump. He gets up and walks around it and sits on the edge right in front of me. It’s hard to smile, but somehow I manage to do it. The rodent man is smiling too.

Don’t shake, Norman. Stop fidgeting.

“This girl’s parents were hiding a book, son. Not just a book, which is bad enough, but a book that contains ideas which are contrary to a healthy, functioning society.”

“I understand, sir. But…”

“Then, they tried to teach her those ideas. They were attempting to poison their own daughter, and she, in turn, would have poisoned others.”

“And, I’m not disagreeing with that, sir.”

“Then what exactly are you disagreeing with, Norman.”

“The girl, sir. She’s only ten. She’s confused. She’s feeling very guilty because she thinks that what happened to her parents is her fault. The system thinks she’s not going to be a productive um… chattel, so it’s suggesting that we push her to self terminate, but I think she’s maybe just telling Consensus that she’s going to kill herself because she really does want help.”

“Really?”

“Yes, sir.”

“How do you know that?”

“It was her voice, sir. I’m very good at reading people and the things they say and the way they say them. I think the system may not be picking up on some of the clues. I know it’s her third violation, but I don’t think she’s beyond saving.” His face softens. His eyes look down at the floor. He’s really thinking about what I said.

“That’s very interesting.”

“Honestly, sir, I’m trying to act in the way that’s best for everyone. I really hope I’m not in trouble. I really want to do a good job.”

“So you think this little girl isn’t beyond saving?”

“Oh no, sir. I think she definitely could be turned back into a valuable per… um… chattel.”

“I see.” He smiles at me, and then he walks back to his chair and sits down. He fiddles with the datapad before he looks back at me. “I appreciate your honesty, Norman. I hope you know how very lucky you are to be here.”

“Oh, I very much do, sir.”

Just keep smiling.

“Now… you say that you’re very good at reading people and the things they say and the way they say them, so I hope you are able to pick up on any subtleties I’m about to convey. There is no room for thinking at your station. Thinking is far above your station. You are a part of my machine, and you do what you’re told. You’re being issued a Sympathy Violation for your actions today, and when you come back tomorrow, you’ll find out exactly what kind of penalty your willful defiance carries with it. Are you able to read me?”

“Yes sir.”

“Good. Now get the fuck out of my office.”

\-

“SHE’S RIGHT OUTSIDE!” Everyone in the department rises out of their chairs and I’m spared anymore thoughts of that awful day. I try to tell everyone to stay at their stations, but they’re not listening. I see an alert on my screen and I halt the tutorial and open up the alert. It brings up a camera feed from the front of City Hall.

The woman that has defied Consensus is climbing the steps right outside of the building. One of the Bishops standing guard begins the recitation of the Example speech. His hammer is drawn and he raises it above his head as the woman makes it to the top of the steps.

Wait. What does she have strapped to her back?! Shelby starts to get out of her chair and I grab her arm.

“Norman, what’s happening?!”

“Just stay here with me.”

The woman on the screen raises her right hand and suddenly I understand. The Bishop is covered in flames and she kicks him through the glass doors. People start screaming as the woman makes her way inside City Hall. I grab Shelby and I lead her to the nearest desk and we hide underneath it.

“We need to run!”

“No! Not yet! Be quiet! We’ll be okay, just be quiet.”

There’s so much screaming in the great hall, and a disgusting smell starts to grow. The same smell that I remember when I watched Thomas burn Simon over and over again just a few days ago. The same smell I remember when I was fifteen.

We can hear the woman screaming for her daughter. She’s going door to door into each department, and when she’s sure her daughter isn’t inside, she lights each of the rooms on fire.

It’s finally here. The end of it all. The system has finally lost control.

It all happens so fast. Shelby is shaking and crying. I’m trying my best to keep her calm.

The door to Department 49 is kicked open.

“EMILY?! EMILY?!” I hear the growling drone of the flames shooting across the room and then the woman moves on.

“Okay, Shelby! Look at me. Okay! I’m getting you out of here! I promise we’ll be okay! I want you to hold my hand and we’re going to run for the front door, okay?!” She nods and I pull her up with me. The room is burning fast and we both cover our mouths as we run through it. When we get to the hall, we turn to our left. It’s so hot! Everything is on fire. Parts of the ceiling are about to collapse. The woman continues to call out for her daughter behind us.

The broken front doors are right in front of us. I think we might be the last ones out.

Just a few more steps and I can see that the sun is about to set.

Once we make it outside, I’m finally able to breathe, but what I see makes my heart sink. There are so many people out here. People from behind the wall. They’ve found a way out. They’re attacking every City Hall worker who managed to get out of the fire. The workers beg them for mercy, but the people from behind the wall are giving them none. The workers from City Hall are being slaughtered with small knives and pipes and jagged pieces of wood. 

No one has seen me and Shelby yet. We run down the steps and we head for the small parking lot on the other side of the building.

Almost there!

The mob finally sees us and I can hear them shouting behind us. They’re coming!

“We’re going to make it, Shelby!”

Shelby starts screaming. I have to get to my car. It’s right in front of us. Just a few feet. Shelby screams my name and then I feel a sharp pain in the back of my head.

\-

I didn’t tell my mum anything about what happened on my first day and she didn't ask. She just kept asking me if I was alright and I just kept smiling and telling her that I was fine. I’ve decided that I’m not going to burden her with anything that happens at my station. She doesn’t deserve that. I want her to be happy. That is what she deserves.

When I get off the tram, I am bound and determined to keep a stiff upper lip, stay quiet, and just do my job. But when I walk into Department 49, there is only one person inside.

Silas.

“Good morning, Norman.”

“Good morning, sir.”

“I’d like you to take a walk with me. Get some fresh air.” I don’t like his smile. What’s about to happen? 

“Okay.” 

We walk back outside and down the steps. He leads me around the building to a small parking lot. Everyone in Department 49 is standing outside and they’re all looking at me. There are also four men dressed in long black coats. Their faces are metal. They scare me.

And in the middle of all of them, there’s a small girl on her knees with her hands behind her back. There’s cloth tied around her mouth, I can see her teeth biting down on it, and a rope is tied around her wrists.

It’s the girl I tried to help yesterday.

Caroline.

“Come here, son. I had the Clerks bring her here. I’m sorry it had to be this way, but I’m concerned that you might not belong here in this city. I’m concerned that your mother might not either.” Silas pushes me toward a man holding up a small silver tank. They strap the tank to my back. There’s a skinny hose coming out of the top of the tank and they strap the end of it on my wrist.

No.

No. 

No.

“I’m afraid that maybe I was too subtle yesterday, Norman. We do not tolerate insubordination here. Our way of life depends on it.” Silas leads me over and makes me stand in front of the girl. She’s crying. “You are the first person who has ever received a Sympathy Violation, and I’m hoping that after today, you will be the last. I want you to look at her, Norman. All you have to do is put up your hand and raise your wrist.”

“Um, sir…”

“Before you say anything more, know this. Either she burns right here by your hand, or your mother does. I have two Bishops near your mother’s apartment right now. It’s time for you to prove your loyalty. Do you understand?”

I can’t say anything. I just smile.

“DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!”

“Yes, sir.”

“Then let her punishment be carried out. Let her be an Example. You have ten seconds to decide, Norman. The girl, a defective simp from behind the wall. Or your mother, an upstanding woman of Consensus… nine.”

He steps aside.

“Eight.”

Everyone is watching me. 

“Seven.”

Caroline is crying. She’s trying to beg through the piece of cloth.

“Six.”

I raise my hand. 

“Five.”

I look over to the men in the black coats and I look at Silas. What happens if I point my arm towards them?

“Four.”

What happens if I fight back? Can I fight back?! What about Mum?

“Three.”

*“You’re gonna have to do things that are bad, whether you want to or not.”*

“Two.”

The little girl is crying. I keep smiling.

Mum.

“One.”

I raise my wrist.

\-

“Hey! Hey, this one’s still alive!”

“Which one?”

“The little fat guy!”

My eyes open as someone turns me over. I’m looking up into the night sky. Two men are standing over me.

“That’s a lot of blood. He’s probably not going to make it. Let him bleed out, come on.”

“No, they said “all survivors”. Come on, let’s get him up.” I turn my head. Shelby is lying on the ground and she’s looking right at me. I try to whisper her name, but my head hurts too much to talk. I smile at her, but her face doesn’t change. Her eyes don’t move. The ground around her neck is all red. The skin is all ripped up on her throat. The two men hoist me up to my feet. Shelby doesn’t move. 

It’s my fault. I told her it was going to be alright. I promised her.

I start to weep and the two men laugh at me.They tie my hands behind my back and drag me to a truck filled with other bloody people from City Hall.

“Welcome to the new world, you fat fuck.” They throw me into the back of the truck.

Business in Bahrain has a rhythm of its own. I’ll never forget my first board meeting on the 26th floor of Bahrain Financial Harbour—overlooking the busy Diplomatic Area as dhows drifted past the shimmering towers and the call to prayer echoed from nearby Manama souqs. That day, the conversation flowed just as naturally as the cardamom coffee, circling around one big question: “What exactly are the corporate governance requirements for Bahraini companies?” The answer, it turned out, was both clear in law and nuanced in practice—shaped by tradition, new regulation, and the unmistakable drive powering Bahrain’s economic future.\
\
Alt text: Professional Bahraini business meeting with diverse professionals around a table., the kingdom’s GDP is projected to grow 3.7% in 2025, bolstered by government reforms and a surge in foreign direct investment. Recent figures from Forbes Business rank Bahrain among the top five regional hubs for ease of doing business and digital transformation.\
\
“Bahrain is where tradition meets transformation,” a Bahraini banker once told me during a Ramadan majlis in Seef District, while explaining the subtle art of deal-making over kunafa and strong Arabic coffee.\
\
Business districts like Bahrain Bay and the Seef District now bustle with fintech startups, family holding companies, and global conglomerates, all drawn by transparent laws, competitive costs, and reliable infrastructure. Bahrain’s government, via the Economic Development Board (EDB), has streamlined incorporation and upgraded the Sijilat system, making company formation swifter than anywhere else in the Gulf.\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern Bahrain office setting with high-rise towers. has tightened requirements for board independence, conflict-of-interest disclosures, and shareholder transparency, especially for closed joint-stock companies (CJSCs) and public entities.\
My firsthand experience: A client in Bahrain Bay almost lost a major partnership when their annual meeting minutes weren’t signed by an independent director (a 2025 update requires this). We corrected it by arranging an urgent majlis with their board—overcoming the issue through quick networking and the invaluable guidance of our local PRO.\
Bahrain Company Formation: Entity Types and Legal Structure\
One of the biggest draws? Flexibility of structure. Whether you’re a solo entrepreneur or a multinational, Bahrain welcomes you.\
Main business types:\
- WLL (With Limited Liability)\
- BSC (Closed Joint Stock Company)\
- BSC (Open/Public Joint Stock Company)\
- Single Person Company (SPC)\
- Branch or Representative Office\
Each structure has unique corporate governance requirements. Details here: Bahrain Business Type Structures (a resource that saved me hours by comparing entity pros/cons in one table).\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration with a team in a modern office.)—a significant edge over Saudi Arabia and the UAE, where local sponsorship is often required. Certain strategic sectors (such as oil or civil aviation) maintain some limitations.\
\
100% Ownership Activities (Official Guide)\
\
Tip: For fastest approvals, apply for commercial registration (CR) via Sijilat before midweek (Monday–Wednesday afternoons), when queues at MOICT in the Diplomatic Area are shortest (I've saved clients up to 2 days this way).\
Corporate Governance: Core Requirements for Bahraini Companies\
1. Board Composition and Independence\
SJC/WLL:\
- Minimum 1 director (for SPC); 2 for WLL\
- Directors can be resident or non-resident\
- No mandatory Bahraini national (except for certain regulated sectors)\
CJSC/BSC:\
- Minimum 3 directors; at least 1/3 must be independent (2025 rule)\
- CEO cannot be the board chairperson\
- Detailed fit-and-proper criteria for directors (see MOICT Circular 2/2025)\
Practical insight: Always appoint at least one independent director from day one if you’re forming a BSC. A client of mine nearly faced registration delays because the board was all family members.\
2. Shareholder Rights and Transparency\
\
AGM required within 6 months of financial year-end\
EGM for major decisions (more than 25% share change, mergers, etc.)\
Minority shareholders (5%+) can demand an audit\
Full disclosure of related party transactions—since 2025, penalties for omissions include suspension of the commercial registration\
\
Pro tip: Draft AGM/EGM notices and meeting agendas in both Arabic and English—Sijilat now requests both for CR renewal (learned this the hard way in 2024 when a single-language submission delayed our renewal by a week).\
3. Audit & Risk Management\
\
Mandatory external audit for all CJSCs and BSCs\
WLLs with annual turnover above BHD 500,000 must appoint an auditor\
BSCs must maintain an audit committee (3+ members, mostly non-execs)\
\
Resource: Use Keylink’s Accounting and Bookkeeping Services—I recommend their audit prep checklist for stress-free regulator visits.\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation with professionals handling paperwork.\
- Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO) register (updated every 12 months)\
- Annual board and shareholder meeting minutes (Arabic required)\
- Timely renewal of CR via Sijilat\
Avoid the queue: Book Sijilat appointments online and arrive before 9am at Seef Mall’s services center for walk-in priority. I’ve skipped dozens of lines with this simple hack.\
5. Codes and Ethical Standards\
The Bahrain Corporate Governance Code (latest: 2025) applies to all BSCs and serves as a best-practice reference for WLLs.\
Key codes:\
- Conflict of interest management (written policy required since April 2025)\
- Insider trading prohibited (regulated by CBB for financial entities)\
- Whistleblowing channels (encouraged, not mandatory for SMEs—but highly advised)\

- For regulated sectors, check if a local sponsor is needed (Local Sponsorship in Bahrain)\
Step 2: Reserve Company Name and Apply for CR\
\
Use the Sijilat portal\
Prepare alternate names (in case your first choice is taken)\
Submit scanned documents: passport, proof of address, business plan, draft MOA\
\
Insider tip: Always bring colour printouts of your documents to the MOICT—black-and-white copies are sometimes rejected for ID verification (learned this after a frustrating wait at the Diplomatic Area office).\
Step 3: Draft MOA & Corporate Governance Policies\
\
Use a model MOA template for your industry (Bahrain EDB and Keylink resources have up-to-date samples)\
Prepare a board charter, code of conduct, and conflict-of-interest policy (mandatory for BSCs from February 2025 onwards)\
\
Step 4: Submit Licenses and Obtain Approvals\
\
Apply for sectoral licenses with MOICT, CBB, LMRA, or Tamkeen as required\
Schedule criminal record checks for directors (needed for board appointments; process is faster if you apply via LMRA’s online system)\
\
Step 5: Open Bank Account and Register for Taxes\
\
Choose a bank with experience in your sector (Ahli United and BBK are the fastest for fintech)\
Register for VAT if annual turnover is above BHD 37,500\
\
Step 6: Implement Ongoing Governance Compliance\
\
Hold annual board and shareholder meetings\
Appoint an auditor and submit financials\
Update UBO register\
Renew CR on Sijilat\
\
Step 7: Leverage Support Resources\
\
Use Keylink’s business support services\
Join industry associations for networking and regulatory updates (the Bahrain Chamber in Sanabis is my go-to for real-time insights)\
\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation with professionals reviewing contracts., we managed approvals within 24 hours—relationships matter hugely here.\
Another classic pitfall: submitting shareholder resolutions only in English. Always include certified Arabic translations to avoid Sijilat rejections. I now use a trusted Seef District translation office with same-day service, which has saved me weeks over the years.\
Business Culture: Unofficial Rules of Engagement\
\
Majlis Power: Most key decisions (including director nominations or conflict resolution) happen in informal majlis settings. Bring business cards, keep your phone silent, and accept all coffee offered.\
Ramadan Adjustments: Business hours shift; plan filings before 1pm. Regulatory offices clear out fast post-Iftar.\
Networking: Knowing the right PRO or agent can mean the difference between 1-day and 7-day approvals.\
\
And here’s a tangent: Bahrain’s start-up scene is so lively that some founders now host “co-working majlis” sessions blending tech pitches with traditional hospitality. It’s a glimpse of the future—where governance and innovation walk hand-in-hand.\
Free Zones and Special Cases\
Bahrain’s free zones (like the BIIP at Salman Industrial City) offer governance simplifications: lower capital, one-stop licensing, and 100% foreign ownership. Worth considering for manufacturing, logistics, or tech businesses. Explore Bahrain Free Zones.\
How Bahrain’s Corporate Governance Stands Apart\
Compared to UAE or Saudi Arabia, Bahrain has less red tape, more flexible ownership, and a digital-first approach. While each Gulf country has its strengths, Bahrain stands out for transparency, rapid licensing, and a genuine openness to expat entrepreneurs.\
\
Alt text: Professional business support in Bahrain, with consultants advising entrepreneurs..\
2. Can foreigners own 100% of a company in Bahrain?\
Yes, for most activities—see updated lists here: 100% Ownership Activities and 99% Foreign Ownership.\
3. What are the ongoing compliance costs?\
Expect annual audit fees of BHD 600–2,500, PRO fees of BHD 400–1,200, and office lease costs of BHD 500–4,200/year. Full cost breakdown here.\
4. What are the biggest pitfalls to avoid?\
Missing Arabic translations, inadequate board independence, and late CR renewals are the most common. Always double-check Sijilat requirements and use professional PRO services to avoid delays.\
5. Where can I get help with accounting and regulatory filings?\
Trusted providers like Keylink offer full support. For sector-specific legal advice, the Bahrain Chamber and EDB are reliable starting points (official info).\

Sorry in advance for the long post, but I don’t think there’s a shorter way to explain what I’ve been going through for over 6 months.

* M24
* Stressful customer service job 

**Timeline / Background**

* **Jan 2025:** Started taking L-theanine (200 mg/day) after \~2 months on a GABA supplement. After stopping briefly, I noticed worsening disorientation, brain fog, memory issues, and anxiety. Restarting helped slightly under stress but overall symptoms worsened over time. Continued taking it for another \~month, and stopped at the end of February. My symptoms worsened immediately, to the point I had a pannic attack at work (even thought it could've been a stroke at the time)  
* **Feb–Mar 2025:** Anxiety, disorientation, dissociation escalated. Panic attacks triggered by stress and even coffee. Developed sensory hypersensitivity (light, sound), paresthesias (burning/tingling around head, mainly forehead, neck, upper parts of limbs), blurry vision, eye floaters, dizziness, and significant weight loss (\~15kg/33lbs).
* **Mar 25, 2025:** B12 tested at **463 pg/ml** (was supplementing 0,2mg cyanocobalamin for a short period of time).
* **Mar–Aug 2025:** Prescribed B-complex: (B1 - 100 mg, B6 - 200, B12 - 0.2 mg). Took \~57 days in total (11 at double dose), cycling roughly 2 weeks on, 1–2 weeks off.
* **Apr-Jan 2025:** Psychiatrist diagnosed GAD (which made no sense to me, as I was coping fairly well in my stressful workplace for almost 3 years at the time), prescribed sertraline + trazodone. Tried them \~10 weeks but felt worse (more anxiety, dissociation, paresthesias, anhedonia). Eventually stopped taking them, with partial improvement but persistent brain fog, anxiety, and disorientation.
* Neurologist: MRI normal. Ophthalmologist: normal exam despite vision issues. GP: mostly “normal” labs.

**Recent findings (Aug 25, 2025):**

* Folate (B9): **3.90 ng/ml** (lab ref: 3.89 – 26.80) → basically 0.01 above cutoff
* B12: **663 pg/ml** (ref: 197 – 771, likely from supplementation)
* Cortisol: **16.9 μg/dl** (normal)

**Current symptoms (persisting \~6+ months):**

* Severe anxiety (out of proportion, constant baseline)
* Fatigue and brain fog
* Disorientation/dissociation
* Paresthesias (burning, tingling around forehead, neck, upper arms, legs)
* Blurry vision and eye floaters
* Weight loss / poor appetite
* Social withdrawal, agoraphobic, job loss, functional decline (semi-bedridden at worst)

**Treatment attempts so far:**

* Tried folic acid 5 mg/day a couple of days ago after finding out I have low folate, prescribed by GP → felt overstimulating, so split into \~1 mg doses. After \~4 days, think I noticed slight improvement (still foggy, fatigued, but maybe slightly less anxious).
* No further targeted testing for methylation/MTHFR etc.

**My questions:**

1. Could my long-lasting symptoms really stem from **functional folate deficiency**, even though my level is technically “within range” (3.9 ng/ml, cutoff 3.89)?(I’ve read that for proper brain/neurological function, folate may need to be **>5 ng/ml**. )\_
2. Could the **B-complex (esp. B12 supplementation)** I took between March–August have skewed my folate test results? I’ve seen conflicting info: some say B12 can artificially raise folate readings, while others say it doesn’t.
3. Given the overlap between my symptoms and folate deficiency, should I pursue further testing or trial treatment with different folate forms (e.g. methylfolate instead of folic acid)?

**TL;DR**  
M24, 6+ months of severe anxiety, brain fog, disorientation, paresthesias, sensory hypersensitivity, weight loss. MRI and other tests normal. Psychiatric meds made me worse (I gave them proper time to work). Recent labs: B12 normal (663 pg/ml after supplementation), **Folate borderline low (3.9 ng/ml, just above deficiency cutoff)**, Cortisol normal. GP prescribed folic acid, but tolerance questionable. Wondering if a **functional folate deficiency** could explain all this and whether my B-complex may have skewed results.

1n52dyn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n52dyn,Help! I am struggling to pick a cabinet color for our new kitchen.,"Hello, wise people! I need help.

We are mid-kitchen remodel in our 100-year old house. It's nearly time to make a final decision on the paint color for our cabinets and I am REALLY struggling.

Kitchen details:

North-west facing, with lots of foliage right outside the window. 

Painted cabinets all the way around.

Soapstone counter with warm, coffee-colored veining (not the white veining you typically see).

Classic subway tile on backsplash.

Black Fisher and Paykel induction range (""classic"" line).

Other appliances are panel ready.

Unlacquered brass knobs and pulls.

White oak flooring to match 100-year old flooring in the rest of the house.

We want a nice neutral, creamy, warm-but-not-too-warm color. I don't want to go too light because I don't like the contrast of white cabinets with dark counters. I have tried samples of so many popular paint colors, including Smokey Taupe, Greenwich Gate, Edgecomb Gray, Natural Linen, Natural Linen 25% lighter, Jute, White Sand, Natural Cream, and others I can't think of right now.

When we first started on this journey I really loved the moody neutrals like Jean Stoffer's kitchen. But I learned very quickly that those colors, like Smokey Taupe and Greenwich Gate, were waaaay too dark for the space. Anything with a green undertone pulls really green. Anything cooler in tone pulls gray, muddy, murky.  The last color I tried was Natural Cream, and I can't even see the Cream when I put the sample in the space - it just looks gray. Edgecomb Gray also looks really gray.

Jute isn't bad, but it's a bit too muddy which makes me nervous.

Natural Linen 25% lighter has a bit too much yellow.

White Sand is probably the closest, but it can pull peachy at certain times of the day, which also makes me nervous! I like the LRV, though, which is about 67.

We want to stick with Benjamin Moore if we can. Our trim color throughout the house is Cloud White, which I love (and also spent a lot of time choosing, so that won't change).

Please, oh wise color experts, please help! I'm going crazy and spending way too much time on this.

Looking for someone to play dead by daylight with.,"Hello! Thank you so much for checking out my post. I’m new to this subreddit but I’ve noticed there are quite a few posts from men that get little to no attention. I just wanted to start by saying thank you! No pressure to read this post entirely, I’m just gonna ramble about myself for a bit. Namely my interests and what I’m looking for.

I’m always looking for friends to play dead by daylight with so if that’s your game then feel free to free to reach out. There’s no obligation for anything romantic to develop. Really I’m just making this post to make some friends and POSSIBLY something more but my preference would be to be friends first and then something else later if we click. (If you’re queer and neurodiverse then we will probably get along lol) I’m a very no nonsense type of person, I think honesty is the best policy but I think that it’s possible to be honest and kind.

I just want to clear something up, some people’s interpretation of bisexuality is that we exclusively date men OR women and that Nonbinary folks are off the table. That’s not at all how I feel, I’m attracted to all kinds of gender expression and I think I’ve stuck with the bisexual label because it’s the label I feel comfortable identifying with. If you are all hesitate about reaching out because you’re worried that I’m not going to accept you for who you are then please know that you are valid and appreciated. Life is too short to not be your authentic self and I want to get to know the real you.

My interests :

The big one is Psychology, I’m currently a student and every day I try to learn something new about it. I will yap for hours about it so please stop me lol. Besides that I also enjoy philosophy and in particular Zen and existentialism. I love all sciences so big plus if you’re also STEM oriented. I’m not exclusively interested in nerdy stuff. I love being in nature and going on walks. I also write poetry whenever I’m on the bus and sometimes mess around with modular synthesis (programming analogue computers to make “music” usually bleep bloop noisy garbage)

Besides that I’m a huge fan of shows like:

Adventure time, Dandadan, Jojo’s bizzare adventure, delicious in dungeon, avatar the last airbender, anime is a big interest but I often return to these shows. I really only watch anime that’s on Netflix but will definitely expand my horizons and watch shows you like if you’re also a big anime fan.

Games I play:

Dead by daylight, Borderlands 2 and 3, Baldur’s gate 3, darkest dungeon, dead cells, Elden ring, I also run a ttrpg game (Vampire the Masquerade) chess (I’m really a novice level and don’t think I’ll ever get out of <1k elo hell) backgammon. I’m open to playing coop games if there’s one you really like.

Music I love:

Gorrilaz, Steely Dan, King Crimson, Talking Heads, Beatles, MF DOOM, Jimi Hendrix, Fleetwood Mac, Led zeppelin, Queen, Bob Dylan, Prince, ABBA, Nirvana. I’m always looking to expand my music horizons so please recommend me stuff.

Who I’m looking for :

Definitely someone who is independent, kind and willing to share special interests. I’m autistic, I got my diagnosis two years ago and I have found that I get on great with other autistic people. I LOVE feminine men and masculine women but I like people for who they are and appearances can be deceiving. I think that if it gets to the stage of wanting to meet up for coffee I’d be happy to send a picture of myself if it would make you more comfortable. if you’re looking for an online romantic relationship I’m happy being friends but would prefer to be with someone that I can hang out with irl. I am monogamous.

My physical description :

5’10” heavy set guy, beard that’s brown but gets reddish when it’s longer (I tend to keep it trimmed) short brown hair. I live in cardigans, jeans and loose shirts.

I am very comfortable with my diagnosis at this point and have done immense work in order to better myself, therefore I don’t need as much support as other people might. But one big issue I have is false expectations or things that are talked about but don’t get done. My boyfriend is very patient and supportive of me, but he seems to forget what I tell him about this topic in particular; because this isn’t the first time this has happened. This morning I went to my mothers house to grab something I needed, and my boyfriend told me he’d be fine if I ran out to grab it. I was gone for 30 mins and I pull back up to my house and his friend is literally picking him up to bring him to his house. I pull into my driveway and he tells me he was going to tell me when he was in his friends car. We say goodbye and I enter my house only to have a full blown panic attack. I would have been completely fine if he just let me know when I was grabbing my coffee. I struggled immensely with abandonment issues as a kid so this may have something to do with it, but do you think I was overreacting? Sometimes I still have that little thought in my mind saying “no one will tolerate your needs” when things like this happen so honestly just looking for validation. Tysvm 🫶🏼 

TLDR: My bf left my house this morning before I got back from getting coffee even tho he knows I have had abandonment issues and I’ve told him all he has to do is let me know; in turn leading to me having a panic attack because it’s a deep fear of mine to be left. Am I overreacting?

I want to share a method I have been using for my clients. It is working very good, and I think maybe this information can help other people here in this business sub.

My clients have good websites, but the big problem is always getting the right people to visit. I found a way that is helping them a lot. I build many small websites for them. Each site is focused on one very, very specific topic.

For example, if my client's main site sells all kinds of coffee beans, I will build one small site all about xyz coffee beans. Another small site will be only about cold brew coffee makers. You get the idea.

These are not small sites in content. Each site I build has over 1,000 pages, with very detailed content, proper schemas, and a good site structure. Because they are so detailed on one topic, Google starts to rank them high for very specific searches.

Then, from these small content-rich sites, I put links that go to my client’s main website. This sends them traffic. But it is high-quality traffic. The visitor coming from the ""xyz coffee beans"" site is very interested in buying that specific coffee. So the chance they buy something is much higher.

For one of my clients, we saw that the visitors from these small sites were 3 times more likely to buy something than visitors from social media ads.

People sometimes ask me, ""Is this safe?"" Yes, it is very safe for their main site. This is because we are not using any spammy tricks. We are building real, useful websites with good information that helps people. Google likes sites that give good information. We are just creating helpful paths for interested customers to find the main product.

I am not a native English speaker, so I hope my explanation is clear. I just found this method is very powerful and gives long-term results.

If you are interested to know more details about this strategy, you can send me a message. I am happy to share more.",0,1756665244.0,smallbusiness,2,0.5,False

I have a 1zpresso q2 coffee grinder that I use for espresso (mainly) and sometimes filter. I got the grinder 2 years ago and been using it daily since, and the grind level required for each bean type has been progressively getting finer and finer until, now, I’m grinding at almost the finest setting in the grinder. Soon enough the grinder won’t be able to grind fine enough to have proper espresso. I assume since it’s getting older the parts are wearing. But which part exactly? I cannot afford to buy a new grinder and need to change only the part that returns the settings to the original grind sizes. 

Also is it possible that there’s an issue in calibration rather than wear and tear?  How to check? Thanks!",1,1756665244.0,1zpresso,0,1.0,False
1n52b1n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n52b1n,I need help picking our cabinet color!,"Hello, wise people! I need help.

We are mid-kitchen remodel in our 100-year old house. It's nearly time to make a final decision on the paint color for our cabinets and I am REALLY struggling.

Kitchen details:

North-west facing, with lots of foliage right outside the window. 

Painted cabinets all the way around.

Soapstone counter with warm, coffee-colored veining (not the white veining you typically see).

Classic subway tile on backsplash.

Black Fisher and Paykel induction range (""classic"" line).

Other appliances are panel ready.

Unlacquered brass knobs and pulls.

White oak flooring to match 100-year old flooring in the rest of the house.

We want a nice neutral, creamy, warm-but-not-too-warm color. I don't want to go too light because I don't like the contrast of white cabinets with dark counters. I have tried samples of so many popular paint colors, including Smokey Taupe, Greenwich Gate, Edgecomb Gray, Natural Linen, Natural Linen 25% lighter, Jute, White Sand, Natural Cream, and others I can't think of right now.

When we first started on this journey I really loved the moody neutrals like Jean Stoffer's kitchen. But I learned very quickly that those colors, like Smokey Taupe and Greenwich Gate, were waaaay too dark for the space. Anything with a green undertone pulls really green. Anything cooler in tone pulls gray, muddy, murky.  The last color I tried was Natural Cream, and I can't even see the Cream when I put the sample in the space - it just looks gray. Edgecomb Gray also looks really gray.

Jute isn't bad, but it's a bit too muddy which makes me nervous.

Natural Linen 25% lighter has a bit too much yellow.

White Sand is probably the closest, but it can pull peachy at certain times of the day, which also makes me nervous! I like the LRV, though, which is about 67.

We want to stick with Benjamin Moore if we can. Our trim color throughout the house is Cloud White, which I love (and also spent a lot of time choosing, so that won't change).

Please, oh wise color experts, please help! I'm going crazy and spending way too much time on this.

A user mentioned a reboxetine + agomelatine combination. Instead of that combination, if I use a bupropion + agomelatine combination, can I still feel the positive effect for emotional dullness? I have emotional dullness and anhedonia. I don't feel any emotions, but I am not depressed. I do activities like drinking coffee, going out, but I don't enjoy any of them, and I also don't feel any of the emotions. Anger, happiness, pride, sadness, hatred, spite... I don't feel any of them. I also don't feel testosterone. I don't enjoy watching movies either. There is a general apathy. Intellectual purposes, goals, such feelings have also disappeared. If I watch a very emotional video, tears flow from my eyes, but I still don't feel the emotion. If I do feel some emotions, if the emotion is very intense, I feel it very, very faintly and momentarily. Like a sudden anger. My self-confidence is a bit low and I have a low level of anxiety. Also, I have a very low level of a manic state. When I used Bupropion for 1-2 days, the manic state became a bit higher, but not very high. Also, when I sleep and wake up, I don't feel groggy; it's as if I woke up without sleeping, I have energy. Sometimes I have difficulty falling asleep. These things I mentioned started in me after using olanzapine and SSRIs 3 years ago. I had only used them for 5-6 months. Also, I have been eating extremely sugary foods for 1-2 years. I read in a few places that a combination of bupropion and Zoloft was effective in bringing back feelings; I used it for a few days and stopped. What should I increase in my body? Dopamine? Norepinephrine? Serotonin? I don't know. Now, if I use agomelatine and bupropion, will I start to feel emotions? (I don't have Reboxetine). Or should I try the Zoloft + Bupropion combination for a longer time? Also, all these problems might be caused by my SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) illness, because it disrupts the neurotransmitter balance in the gut. I am also dealing with SIBO disease.

1n52asi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PropertyManagement/comments/1n52asi/leasing_agent_issues/,Leasing Agent Issues,"Hi all,

I’m a property manager for multiple sites, and one of my leasing agents recently requested a meeting with HR to say that I don’t do my job and that he “does everything for me.” That’s not true at all, in fact, he regularly refuses to do tours, complains about basic leasing responsibilities, gives misinformation to residents, and resists feedback. I delegate tasks that are part of his role (tours, move-ins, follow-ups, renewals, etc.), while I handle the broader responsibilities (compliance, reporting, resident escalations, vendors, occupancy). Still, he twists it as if I’m “dumping” work on him so I can sit around and do nothing.

Since I started with this company (about 6 months ago), I’ve gone out of my way to give him grace. When I arrived, he had been working weekends, so I told him he no longer had to as he complained everyday about it and has stated that he doesn’t do anything besides sit on his phone due to no traffic. I’ve tried to be kind and understanding, buying him coffee/lunch, offering support and advice when he’s not doing his job, instead of writing him up. I don’t want to throw that back in his face, but I have really tried to set him up for success. That’s why this feels like such a punch in the gut. A lot of this seems to stem from him recently asking for a raise and a promotion. I told him I submitted it to HR because I can’t be the only one to approve it, it has to go through a process and discussion. He feels he “does too much” for his role and deserves to be compensated and promoted, but the reality is he struggles to consistently handle his core responsibilities as a leasing agent.

For context: he’s the only person left from the previous management team, which left the property in a huge mess. The property manager before me apparently showed up late, left whenever they wanted, and essentially left him running everything as a leasing agent. He never once complained or asked for a raise or promotion then. But now, with me holding him accountable to his actual job, suddenly he feels overworked and undervalued. I’m confused by the inconsistency and the hostility. What’s worse, instead of addressing issues with me directly, he went over my head to HR, and it’s making me feel incredibly anxious and sick. I’ve barely slept and have been physically ill thinking about what he might say. My regional told me not to worry, that he’ll sink his own ship, and HR and herself are not concerned about me or my performance, but I can’t shake this awful feeling of being undermined. I’ve started documenting incidents (lying to residents, refusing tasks, drinking with residents and discussing their mutual dislike of upper management, etc.), but the whole thing makes me want to avoid work altogether.

But not only that, it's held by the man himself, Sam Lake! This version was apparently sold for a while in the Remedy store.

**#3 (this is where it gets weird) the uhm... Oh Deer Diner version (in game) small text + blue lines version?**

There are two of them as shown in the pictures. A smaller version which kind of ""doesn't count"" since it is very different from the others, but the ""proper"" version has clearly one thin and one thick blue line.

So... what the f\*ck? Which is the real version? Or is it all a spiral?

You could also argue that the Koskela brothers made their own cups to save money, that would kind of fit their personalities.

Alan Wake on the other hand hasn't seen a proper cup for years. He has, however, seen the original white cups (in AW1 they were plain white), as well as the collectible thermoses with the Oh Deer Diner logo, and those two combined would kind of make the Dark Place version of the thermos.

  Present Day  
  
  I stare at my reflection in the small mirror.  
  
  My long brown hair is tied back into a ponytail. Face clean, free of makeup. I glance down at my clothes. Jeans and a baby-blue T-shirt. Black ballet flats on my feet.  
  
  The clothes and shoes that I wore when I came to prison.  
  
  The jeans and T-shirt are a little loose on me. I knew I’d lost weight in here. Daily use of the gym and stress will shed pounds off a girl. Not that I was heavy to begin with. I look too thin. I could do with putting some weight back on.  
  
  “You ready?”  
  
  Turning from my reflection, I look at Officer Roman standing in the doorway. “I’m ready.”  
  
  So ready.  
  
  I have never been more ready for anything in my life.  
  
  One last look around, and with nothing to take with me, I leave the cell I spent my last night in and follow her down the corridors.  
  
  I was moved to a release cell last night, so I didn’t spend my last night in the cell where I’d spent the past eighteen months. Not that I’m upset about it. Quite the opposite.  
  
  I’m frigging ecstatic.  
  
  I’m being released.  
  
  Eighteen months, I’ve dreamed of this moment. Counted down the minutes, hours, days…praying I would be released on parole after serving eighteen months of the three-year sentence I’d been given.<  
br />  
  Being out on parole means I’ll be living under conditions set by my probation officer, but at least I won’t be here.  
  
  I’m getting out of this hellhole.  
  
  I’m holding the relief back, keeping it restrained.  
  
  I won’t let myself feel anything until I’m out of here and back in the real world.  
  
  A world where I get my life back. A world where I can get back to the only person who has ever mattered to me.  
  
  My brother, Jesse.  
  
  I say my brother, but he’s my kid. When I was sixteen and Jesse was six, our drug-addicted, waste-of-space mother bailed on us, disappearing with all the money we’d had and leaving me alone to raise him. But I’d been raising him since he was a baby because all my mother cared about was herself, drugs, and whomever she was screwing at that time.  
  
  When she left, I quit school and got a job, working in a factory, to get money to feed and clothe Jesse and pay our rent and bills. Not glamorous but it helped. Just barely. We scraped by. I’d buy the cheap food and go to the supermarket just before closing time, so I could get the reduced food, like dented tins because the price had been dropped on them. Sometimes, they would get dented on purpose. I’d shop in secondhand stores for clothes. I did everything I could to make sure the money would stretch.  
  
  It was hard, but I always made sure that Jesse was okay. He came first.  
  
  He always comes first.  
  
  I worked at the factory for a year, but I got laid off when they had a cut in the work force. It was last in, first out. I was the last one hired, so I was the first to be out of a job.  
  
  It got hard until I found another job. I didn’t have savings because there was never any spare money to save.  
  
  I applied for jobs but wouldn’t get them because I didn’t have any qualifications. I received state benefits, and I still cashed in Jesse’s child benefit that came through for my mother—yes, I would forge her signature—but it wasn’t enough for both of us. And I couldn’t exactly tell the benefit people that I needed more money because, if they knew that my mother had left, they would have taken Jesse away. And I couldn’t lose him.  
  
  It got really tough for a time. There were days when I would go without food so that Jesse could eat.  
  
  I could have asked my best friend, Cece, for help, but I had to do it alone. Jesse was my responsibility.  
 Then, luck came on my side, and I got a part-time job, stacking shelves at the local supermarket. A week later, I got a part-time waitressing job. The waitressing was in the evenings, and I hated leaving Jesse, but Cece would look after him while I was working.  
  
  I did those jobs for six months, all the while still applying for full-time work. Finally, I landed a job in this upscale jewelry store. I could hardly believe I’d gotten the job. I mean, the interview had gone well, but I was uneducated, and the place was nice. For some reason, the manager had seen something in me and given me the job.  
  
  It was the best…and worst thing that ever happened to me.  
  
  The best part was the money. I was being paid more than both of my part-time jobs combined. I was learning a trade in the jewelry business, and it meant I could be home every night for Jesse.  
  
  Little did I know, four years later, I’d be framed for stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth of jewelry from the store and that I would go to prison for it.  
  
  That I would lose everything.  
  
  Lose Jesse.  
  
  My kid. My family.  
  
  I want him back.  
  
  I will get him back.  
  
  Eighteen months without seeing or speaking to him, it’s killed me.  
  
  Our communication was only via letters. Well, I say communication, but it wasn’t exactly that. I wrote to him. He never once wrote back.  
  
  He’s angry.  
  
  Because I wouldn’t let him come visit me while I was in there.  
  
  He thought I’d abandoned him.  
  
  Truth was, I couldn’t bear the thought of him seeing me in there. And I didn’t want him coming to this place.  
  
  I wouldn’t let anyone visit me. Not even Cece.  
  
  So, I haven’t seen or spoken to anyone I love in eighteen months.  
  
  My heart pounding, I continue to follow Officer Roman. I wait while she unlocks the gate, and then she takes me through, heading toward the reception area.  
  
  I haven’t seen this part of the prison since I arrived here.  
  
  I look out through the window. My heart pounds with equal measures of nerves and excitement.  
  
  I’m getting out of here. I’m getting my life back.  
  
  The life that was stolen from me.  
  
  Officer Kendall hands me a plastic carrier bag. “The things you came in with,” she tells me.  
  
  Opening the bag, I look inside.  
  
  My old phone that no longer works, a used lip gloss, my purse. I pick my purse out and open it. Inside is a twenty pound note.  
  
  I have twenty pounds to my name.  
  
  Sigh.  
  
  I spy my old house keys in the bottom of the carrier bag. I touch my fingers to them. The keys to my old home. The home I no longer have.  
  
  Tears prick my eyes. I blink them back.  
  
  “You okay, Daisy?” Officer Roman asks me.  
  
  Swallowing past my emotions, I nod my head and drop my purse back into the carrier bag.  
  
  “You know where you’re going from here?” she asks me.  
  
  “Yep.” I look at her. “I go straight to London Probation Service to see my probation officer…” I stall, trying to recall his name.  
  
  “Toby Willis,” she fills in for me. “Toby will determine the terms of your release and give you details of the hostel where you’ll be staying.”  
  
  “You mean, I’m not staying at the Ritz?”  
  
  I give her a look of mock-horror, and she laughs.  
  
  “Come on, comedian, let’s get you out of here.”  
  
  The officer inside the reception room buzzes us through. I follow behind Officer Roman as she leads me to the door that will take me out of here.  
  
  I watch, my heart hammering in my chest, as the final door opens.  
  
  I’m free.  
  
  I take in a deep breath. A lungful of free air.  
  
  I know it sounds stupid, but the air just feels better out here. Cleaner, fresher. Better than the air I was breathing behind those high walls that kept me prisoner for so long.  
  
  I take my first step toward freedom.  
  
  “I don’t want to see you in here ever again.” Officer Roman’s voice comes from behind me.  
  
  I glance back at her. “You won’t ever see me again; that’s a promise.”  
  
  A smile works its way onto her hard mouth. “Good. And good luck, Daisy. I hope everything works out for you.”  
  
  Yeah, me, too.  
  
  I give her a nod and then face forward. Another deep breath, and I step out onto the street.  
  
  The door closes behind me with a clunk. I hear the lock turn, shutting me out.  
  
  For a moment, I panic.  
  
  I literally don’t know what to do. I’ve spent so long being told what to do that I feel like I don’t know my own thoughts in this moment.  
  
  I look up and down the street. People are milling around.  
  
  A figure across the street catches my eye, and I can’t help the smile that breaks out on my face.  
  
  Cece.  
  
  “Ce?” I say, suddenly choked with emotion at the sight of her.  
  
  “Mayday!” She smiles big.  
  
  Hearing her call me by the nickname that Jesse gave me when he was little fills me with an ache so deep that I fear it’ll never leave.  
  
  Cece pushes off the car she was leaning against and comes bounding toward me. Her dark brown waves, now streaked with purple, are dancing around her face, her big brown eyes wide with happiness.  
  
  The wind is knocked out of me as Cece collides with me, wrapping her arms tight around me, hugging me hard.  
  
  She smells like home.  
  
  God, I’ve missed her.  
  
  “I missed you,” she whispers.  
  
  I hear the emotion in her voice. It makes my chest constrict and my eyes sting.  
  
  Dropping the carrier bag to the ground, I hug her back. “I missed you, too, Ce.” I swallow back tears. “What are you doing here?”  
  
  “Nice to see you, too.” She chuckles.  
  
  “I mean”—I lean back to look into her face—“I thought you’d be at work.”  
  
  “Monday’s my day off now. But, even if it weren’t, did you really think I wouldn’t be here, waiting for you?” She smiles warmly. “It’s been too long. I hate that you wouldn’t let me come visit you.” A frown puckers her brow.  
  
  I exhale a breath. “I know, but it was better that way, Ce. I didn’t want you seeing me while I was in that place.”  
  
  And I couldn’t spend my time counting down the days to her visits. I needed to just focus on counting down the days to my release.  
  
  “And you knew I didn’t agree. It didn’t matter to me—”  
  
  “I know,” I cut her off. My voice comes out sharp, so I soften it. “But I needed it to be that way.”  
  
  She stares at me for a long moment. “Yeah, well, you leave again, and I’m coming with. You got me?”  
  
  I give her a tight smile. “I got you. But I’m not going anywhere.”  
  
  And I mean that. I’m never falling prey to anyone ever again.  
  
  She smiles. “You look good,” she tells me. “You sure you’ve been in prison and not just at a fitness camp?” She gives a comical tilt of her head.  
  
  “Funny.” I give her a light jab to the shoulder. “I used the gym every day. Not much else to do in there.” Well, apart from reading, watching TV, and doing the cleaning job I had.  
  
  “Well, you totally have the whole Lara Croft thing going on now.” She reaches over my shoulder, giving my ponytail a tug.  
  
  “I love the purple.” I gesture to her hair.  
  
  “It was blue last week.” She grins.  
  
  Cece is always changing her hair color. It comes with the territory. She’s a hairdresser—or I should say, hairstylist. She works at this really cool upscale salon in London.  
  
  Releasing her hands from my arms, she grabs my hand. “Come, let’s get you out of here.”  
  
  I scoop my carrier bag up from the ground and let her lead me across the road, toward her car.  
  
  I’ve just buckled up in the passenger seat when she turns to me, biting her lip, with a nervous look in her eyes  
.  
  
  “I did something…that I hope you’ll be cool with.”  
  
  “Depends. The last surprise someone gave me landed me in prison.” I give her a deadpan look.  
  
  Her lips lift into a half-smile. “How long are you going to play that card?”  
  
  “Forever. I think I’ve earned it.”  
  
  “True.” She nods.  
  
  “So, this thing?”  
  
  “I got us a place.”  
  
  My eyes widen in surprise. “You moved out of your mum and dad’s?”  
  
  “It was time. And you need somewhere to live. My gran left me a good chunk of money when she died, so I put it to good use and invested it in an apartment.”  
  
  Shame covers me. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there for the funeral.”  
  
  She waves me off. “I know you would have been there if you could. Anyway, I got us this apartment in Sutton. It’s nice. Three bedrooms. Not far from where Jesse is living, so you can be close to him.”  
  
  “Three bedrooms?” I stare at her.  
  
  “Yeah, a bedroom for you, one for me, and one for Jesse when he comes back home.”  
  
  A lump forms in my throat.  
  
  I can’t believe what she’s done for me.  
  
  She got this apartment to help me. She knows this is what I need to get Jesse back. It’s not like I can apply for custody of Jesse without a stable home. I was expecting to be in a hostel to start with until I got on my feet, and it would have taken me ages to sort out a place.  
  
  “Have you…” I bite my lip. “Have you seen Jesse recently?”  
  
  She exhales, and I know the answer. “I went to see him yesterday.”  
  
  Jesse has been living in a group home since I was put in prison.  
  
  I know what those places are like. I’ve been worried sick about him every moment I’ve been away from him, praying to God to keep him safe until I could get back to him.  
  
  Cece promised to check in on him regularly, and she’s kept me updated on his progress.  
  
  “How is he?”  
  
  “He’s doing okay.”  
  
  “Did you…” I swallow past the ache. I know full well the answer to my question, yet I have to ask it anyway. “He knew I was getting out today?”  
  
  “Yeah.” Her voice is quieter now. “He’s just confused at the moment, Mayday. But he’ll come around. He loves you.”  
  
  My eyes lower. “I let him down.”  
  
  “No, you didn’t.” The force in her tone brings my stare to her. “You met and trusted a guy you thought was nice, but he turned out to be the biggest fucker in the history of all fuckers. It was not your fault. I swear, if I ever get my hands on that bastard, I’m gonna rip his balls clear off, douse them in petrol, set them on fire, and make him watch them burn.”  
  
  “That’s quite the visual.”  
  
  “Thank you. I do paint a good picture.” She grins at me. “And I’ll feel awesome after I sort out that stain on society.”  
  
  “I just want to forget he ever existed. My sole focus is on getting Jesse back.”  
  
  She reaches over and takes my hand in hers, squeezing. “You’re gonna get him back. I have no doubt. All the good stuff starts right now.”  
  
  The tears that I was holding back win the battle, and one escapes.  
  
  “Don’t you bloody cry, Daisy May, or you’ll have me crying, and I’m not wearing waterproof mascara. So, what do you say about the apartment?”  
  
  I brush the tear away with the back of my hand. “I say it’s awesome, but—”  
  
  “No buts, Mayday. Just say yes, you’re moving in with me.”  
  
  I give her a look for cutting me off. “The but is, I’ll have to check with my probation officer to make sure it’s okay. They’ve already arranged for me to stay in a hostel.”  
  
  “Uh-uh. No way is my girl staying in some skanky hostel for ex-convicts—no offense.” Her face blanches when she realizes what she just said. “Because you’re not an ex-con, Daisy. Well, technically, you are, but you aren’t, and—”  
  
  “Ce, it’s fine.” I laugh. “I am an ex-con. It’s just the way it is.”  
  
  Daisy Smith, ex-con.  
  
  That brand will stay with me until the day I die.  
  
  My life is completely different now to how it was before I went inside. There’s nothing I can do about that. But I can do something about my future.  
  
  I can make sure that I never let myself be fooled by a man again.  
  
  And I can damn well make sure that I build a better life for Jesse and me.  
  
  Better than what we had before.  
  
  I’m not smart. I don’t have a degree. But I’m a hard worker.  
  
  All I need is for someone to take a chance on me and give me the opportunity to give Jesse everything he should have had…everything he deserves.  
  
  The kid was dealt a shit hand. At least I had our mum around when I was growing up—not that she was much use even then—but her drug habit worsened after Jesse was born. I think our dad dying was the catalyst.  
  
  Our dad was barely around as it was. An addict himself, he was out on one of his benders and injected himself with some bad heroin—not that there’s such a thing as good heroin. One minute, he was there, and the next, he was gone. And so was she. She was there physically—well, not all the time—but she checked out mentally. So, when she left, it wasn’t exactly a hardship.  
  
  I had Jesse, and that was all I cared about.  
  
  “I have to go check in with my probation officer now,” I tell Cece. “So, I’ll ask him about moving in with you and see what he says.”  
  
  “Cool. We’ll go see him and tell him that you’re coming home with me today.” She gives me a petulant smile.  
  
  I shake my head, laughing. When Cece has something set in her head, there’s no dissuading her. It’s one of the many things I love about her. That, and her fierce loyalty.  
  
  She turns on the engine, and the radio in her car comes on. Drake’s “Hold On, We’re Going Home” bleeds out of the car speakers.  
  
  I let out a humorless laugh and meet Cece’s eyes. “You have this playing on purpose?”  
  
  A small smile plays on her lips. “Maybe.”  
  
  I let out another laugh. But I don’t really feel it. Because I’m not going home. Not really. Home is where Jesse is, and I can’t be with him because I made a mistake. I trusted the wrong person, and it cost me my brother and eighteen months of my life.  
  
  I rest my head back against the seat and stare out the passenger window, letting out a sigh.  
  
  “Hey…you okay?” Cece’s voice is soft.  
  
  I turn my head to look at her. “Yeah”—I smile—“I’m good. And thanks for…everything. I don’t know what I’d do without you.”  
  
  She reaches over and squeezes my hand. “You’ll never have to find out.”  
  
  Two  
  
  Sitting in the empty waiting room on the first floor of the probation service office, waiting to see my assigned probation officer, Toby Willis, I stare out the window and look at the busy London area.  
  
  Everything looks the same but different.  
  
  Or maybe it’s just me that’s different.  
  
  Cece wanted to come in with me, but I told her to go grab a coffee instead of being stuck in the waiting room until I was done. I told her that I’d meet her back at the car in an hour.  
  
  That was half an hour ago, and I still haven’t been called in to see him.  
  
  As I think it, a guy appears in the open doorway. Looks to be in his mid-thirties. Shaved hair—like literally not a hair is to be found on his head—and he’s wearing a black pinstriped suit that looks like it’s seen better days.  
  
  “Daisy Smith? I’m Toby Willis. Do you want to come through?”  
  
  I get to my feet and follow him down the corridor and into his office. I take the seat at his desk as he shuts the door behind us.  
  
  He comes around the desk and takes his seat. “Sorry I was late for our appointment. I got stuck in a meeting I couldn’t get out of.”  
  
  “It’s fine.” I smile. “I’m used to waiting around, and it’s not like I have anyplace to be.”  
  
  He lifts his  
eyes to mine. They’re blue and kind-looking. Actually, now that I think about it, his whole face looks kind. In stark contrast with his harsh-looking bald head.  
  
  He smiles. “Well, let’s hope we can change that for you.” He turns to his computer and taps some keys. Then, he reaches over and grabs a file.  
  
  I see my name written on the top.  
  
  He opens the file, looking through some of the papers. “So”—he looks up at me—“I won’t keep you here long. Really, all we need to do is have you look over the terms of your release and have you sign the license that signals your release. Then, we’ll discuss housing options and employment possibilities.”  
  
  “Can I start with the housing options?” I ask.  
  
  Leaning back in his chair, he gives me a nod, giving me the go-ahead.  
  
  “I know I’m supposed to move into a hostel. But my best friend has a three-bedroom apartment in Sutton, South London, and she’s asked me to live with her. If that’s okay with you.”  
  
  “Your friend, she doesn’t have a criminal record?”  
  
  “God, no.” I laugh quickly. “She’s a hairstylist. Never been in trouble in her life.”  
  
  But then again, neither had I until I was stitched up for theft.  
  
  I hold my tongue on that one. No point in protesting my innocence anymore. That ship sailed a long time ago.  
  
  “Then, I don’t see a problem with it. So long as I have the address and your friend’s details, then it’s fine.”  
  
  “Thank you.” I breathe a sigh of relief. I didn’t want to say it to Cece, but the thought of living in a hostel…it felt like I would be going back into a form of prison. “Do you want the address now? I have it. Cece wrote it down for me.”  
  
  “Sure.”  
  
  From my jeans pocket, I get the piece of paper with my new address on it and hand it over. He takes it from me and puts it inside my file.  
  
  “Here are the terms of your release. You have to adhere to these rules for the remainder of your sentence.” He hands over the sheet of paper. “Read them carefully, and then sign at the bottom. Know that you don’t have to sign, but the terms will still be legally binding.”  
  
  “Okay.” I give him a weak smile.  
  
  I read over the terms. They say what I expected them to…that if I am found breaking the law in any way, then I’ll be back inside to serve out the remainder of my sentence.",1,1756665043.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Coming to visit from Philadelphia in a couple weeks, and very excited to explore and celebrate our 5-year anniversary. I've only had a quick stopover in Chicago before, so lots to see and do. Here is what I have planned so far, let me know what I'm missing  or if I should make any changes. We are a mid-30s couple and are very active, love to walk/explore. It looks like weather \*should\* be great, so hoping to maximize our time outside. FYI not really interested having in deep dish pizza this trip (have had before on previous trip, and it is not my favorite, too filling for me!

* Thurs - don't arrive until 7pm, staying around The Loop. Figured we would have a quick/casual dinner in the area (Portillo's?), and then hit up a bar (maybe Gus Sip & Dip, Untitled Supper Club, Three Dots and a Dash) and walk around the RiverWalk/Art on the Mart
* Fri - this is our anniversary day! Would like to get a light breakfast of coffee/pastries at a cute cafe or coffee shop (any suggestions? hoping for something cute and delicious but not too far out of the way). Then planning on hitting up the Art Institute or Museum of Science and Industry. Lighter lunch somewhere (not sure where, prefer no reservations needed so we can be spontaneous). We have the CAC river cruise at 5:30pm, then reservations at Omakase Room at Sushi-San for dinner at 8:30 (deposit paid so not changing this -very excited for this, we love sushi)
* Saturday - was thinking of trying Lula's for breakfast/brunch (any good alternatives in the area if we cannot get a seat?), then walking the 606 through Wicker Park/Logan Sq area. Food not planned yet midday. May try and rent kayaks on the river depending on time. We have dinner reservations at 8:00 pm at Marisco San Pedro, but open to change if other suggestions
* Sunday - any coffeeshop recommendations near Lincoln Park area? After breakfast, plan on exploring Lincoln Park area. Nothing planned yet during the day, but we have tickets for Second City show at 7pm, any recommendations for food near Second City before the show? Thought about Armitage Alehouse, but there aren't any reservations, is it worth trying luck at the bar? The sticky date cake looks so good...
* Monday: Our plane is at 4:45 pm, nothing planned yet for the morning. Thinking of getting sandwiches at either JP Grazianos or Mr. Beef before heading to the airport

She's the greatest scammer, swindler or gambler yet the ML can outgamble, outswindle and outscam her with ease. She's always the one getting scammed into whatever it is they get into. Godforbid she's an escape artists that girl is getting caught at the thought of it. 

She's the strongest fighter or knight, whoops she le stumble and the ML has his sword on her neck. 

Her magic is incomparable, unstoppable even. ML seems to work as kryptonite that cripples her abilities. 

She has the best network, has never been found out, runs the top information guild in the country. ML has the most greatest most better network ever that goes against her.

She's super powerful in status, he is higher. She's a duchess he is a grand Duke, she's any other title, he's the prince. She's a grand duchess, he's the emperor. She is god mofo is gods god. 

I swear the FL could discover, create or recive divine revelations that aren't coffee, healing powers, modern tech, or making flowers bloom and the ML WILL FIND A WAY TO OVERSHADOW HER. 

Obviously I'm not talking about every single story, but also as I mentioned above there are also some very specific aspect that FL's are the only ones where they are allowed to be the greatest or better which give me an icky feeling.  

Feels like this has to be rooted from some mysogistic spmething, but that's a story for another day.

One time I read a comment on where the FL was supposed to be this super human standing heads above everyone else and the ML still managed fo be taller than her, or when reading some slop called ""the price of breaking up"" or something like that, girly would pull put a knife for show because the ML would come in and do all the fighting.

I've been trying to save all paper/cardboard boxes, bags, cups, cartons, etc. to keep them for composting, but I'm really worried about there being a small amount of plastic even if it seems fully paper. Rather than asking you to go through a comprehensive checklist or entire photo album, how can I tell if a paper container has plastic in it? If it is even a bit glossy, I get paranoid that it's not all paper, but I don't want to be throwing things into my normal trash unnecessarily. 

I've included 3 pictures that all seem to be paper, but there's a glossiness or thickness to the box surface/coloring that makes me concerned. To give some other examples, things like BlueBell Ice cream containers and Starbucks coffee cups seem safe but I just don't know. 

Is there an easy way to tell without having a comprehensive list?

# The AI Video Generator That Just Broke the Economics of Content Creation 🚨

Professional video production died on August 26, 2025.

That's when Alibaba released Wan 2.2 S2V - the AI video generator that creates Hollywood-quality content for zero cost.

While agencies still charge $50,000 for 30-second commercials, this AI video generator produces equivalent quality for the price of electricity.

I'm Julian Goldie, and I've been tracking this AI video generator revolution since day one.

The implications are staggering.

# What This AI Video Generator Actually Delivers

Forget everything you know about AI video generator limitations.

This tool creates cinematic content that looks professionally produced.

An old man by a campfire with perfect lighting and natural expressions.

A wizard on a mountaintop with lightning, flowing robes, and epic atmosphere.

Coffee shop scenes with realistic steam, professional depth of field, and morning lighting.

Aerial stunts with wind effects, natural hair movement, and incredible camera work.

This AI video generator doesn't create ""AI-looking"" content. It creates movie-quality footage.

# The Speech-to-Video Breakthrough in AI Video Generator Technology

Text-to-video is impressive. Speech-to-video is revolutionary.

Give this AI video generator one image, one audio file, and one text prompt.

Three inputs create professional talking videos with perfect lip sync.

Full body motion. Camera movement. Natural expressions that match emotional context.

This AI video generator understands rhythm, emotion, and timing through Wave2Vec technology.

The same system Meta uses for advanced speech recognition.

When someone sings, lips move perfectly. When emotions change, facial expressions align naturally.

# Why This AI Video Generator Destroys Google's Business Model

Google Veo 3 charges hundreds monthly. You pay continuously for usage restrictions.

This AI video generator costs zero. Download once, own forever.

Google runs their AI video generator in the cloud. They control everything.

Price changes, content censorship, service termination - all at Google's discretion.

This AI video generator runs on your hardware. Your computer, your rules, your content.

Official benchmarks prove this free AI video generator outperforms Google's paid solution.

Higher aesthetic quality scores. Better motion dynamics. Superior text rendering.

Better results at zero cost. That's how industries get disrupted.

# The Economic Destruction This AI Video Generator Causes

Video production agencies built businesses around $10,000 per minute pricing.

This AI video generator makes their entire cost structure obsolete.

Marketing departments that outsource video creation can bring everything in-house.

Corporate training budgets that consume millions annually shrink to hardware costs.

The friction between ideas and execution disappears with this AI video generator.

Customer testimonials no longer require scheduling coordination.

Take existing audio testimonials, run them through this AI video generator, get professional videos instantly.

Coming to visit from Philadelphia in a couple weeks, and very excited to explore and celebrate our 5-year anniversary. I've only had a quick stopover in Chicago before, so lots to see and do. Here is what I have planned food-wise so far, let me know what I'm missing (questions in bold) or if I should make any changes. FYI not really interested having in deep dish pizza this trip. We are a mid-30s couple and love to walk/explore, so fine with different neighborhoods as long as they are reasonably close to the activities below. We have no food restrictions and like all types of cuisines. I've done a good bit of research (including looking at this sub), just looking to fill in the items in bold below.

* Thurs - don't arrive until 7pm, staying around The Loop. Figured we would have a **quick/casual dinner in the area** (Portillo's?), and then hit up a bar (maybe Gus Sip & Dip, Untitled Supper Club, Three Dots and a Dash) and walk around the RiverWalk
* Fri - this is our anniversary! Would like to get a **light breakfast of coffee/pastries at a cute cafe or coffee shop** (any suggestions? hoping for something not too far out of the way). Then planning on hitting up the Art Institute. **Lighter lunch somewhere** (not sure where, prefer no reservations needed so we can be spontaneous). We have the CAC river cruise at 5:30pm, then reservations at Omakase Room at Sushi-San for dinner at 8:30 (deposit paid so not changing this)
* Saturday - was thinking of trying Lula's for breakfast/brunch (**any good alternatives in the area if we cannot get a seat?**), then walking the 606 through Wicker Park/Logan Sq area. Probably will need a **snack/lunch**. May try and rent kayaks on the river depending on time. We have dinner reservations at 8:00 pm at Marisco San Pedro (**Is this a good plan? any other suggestions?**)
* Sunday - any **coffeeshop recommendations near Lincoln Park** area? Then plan on exploring Lincoln Park. Nothing planned yet during the day, but we have tickets for Second City show at 7pm, recommendations for **food near Second City** **before the show**? Thought about Armitage Alehouse, but there aren't any reservations, is it worth trying luck at the bar? The sticky date cake looks so good...
* Monday: Our plane is at 4:45 pm, so only would get lunch before leaving. Was thinking sandwiches at either JP Grazianos or Mr. Beef - **other ideas**

We’ve only had brief, work-related interactions, usually short yes/no type conversations. He’s single, hardworking, respected by colleagues, and I’ve noticed he’s more casual and chatty with other interns, but not so much with me.

Over time, I’ve developed a crush on him. I admire his dedication, how others enjoy working with him, and his playful side when he laughs. With my internship coming to an end, I’m realizing how much I’ll miss seeing him on a daily basis.

I don’t know whether he feels anything toward me, and I haven’t had the chance to talk with him outside of work topics. I’m unsure how to manage these feelings. Part of me is considering asking him for a casual coffee before my internship ends, but I’m also worried about our age gap (24 vs. 38), even though he comes across as youthful in personality.

How can I navigate this situation without making things awkward or unprofessional?

1n52139,https://i.redd.it/k7pwjhundemf1.jpeg,My Journey with ViaSocket:," A Game-Changer for Workflow Automation

So I've been using ViaSocket for a while now, and honestly? It's been pretty eye-opening. Let me walk you through my experience and why I think it might be worth checking out if you're drowning in repetitive tasks like I was.

. How I stumbled upon ViaSocket

I'll be straight with you – I wasn't actively looking for another automation tool. My desk was already cluttered with sticky notes reminding me to update spreadsheets, send follow-up emails, and sync data between different platforms. It was getting ridiculous.

A colleague mentioned ViaSocket during a coffee break, saying it helped them connect their CRM to their email marketing tool without any coding headaches. That caught my attention because, well, I'm definitely not a developer.

.What actually impressed me

After diving in, here's what stood out:

  The setup process doesn't make you want to pull your hair out.** I expected the usual tech nightmare – confusing menus, unclear instructions, the works. Instead, ViaSocket's interface actually makes sense. You can see your workflow visually, which helps when you're trying to figure out what connects to what.

  It plays nice with everything I already use.** My Google Workspace, Slack channels, project management tools – they all connected without drama. No weird compatibility issues or ""this feature requires a premium upgrade"" surprises.

  It actually works when you're not babysitting it.   I've had automation tools that would randomly break or need constant tweaking. ViaSocket has been surprisingly reliable. I set up workflows weeks ago that are still humming along perfectly.

  You can get as simple or complex as you want.  Started with basic stuff like ""when I get an email with this subject, add it to my task list."" Now I've got multi-step workflows that would've taken me hours to do manually.

  Their support team doesn't treat you like an idiot.  When I had questions, they actually helped instead of sending me generic copy-paste responses.

   The real-world impact

Here's where it gets interesting. I connected my project management tool with my email and calendar, and suddenly I wasn't manually creating calendar events every time a new task popped up. When project statuses change, my team gets notified automatically, and deadlines sync across all our tools.

Last month alone, I probably saved 8-10 hours of mind-numbing admin work. That's time I could spend on actual productive stuff instead of copying and pasting information between platforms.

   A few things I learned along the way

Start small – don't try to automate your entire business on day one. Pick one annoying task and automate that first. Once you see it working, you'll naturally find other processes to streamline.

The pre-built templates are goldmines. Instead of building everything from scratch, browse what's already there. Someone probably had the same workflow needs as you.

Test everything before you rely on it. I learned this the hard way when I accidentally sent the same notification to my team five times because I didn't check my trigger settings properly.

  Bottom line

Look, I'm not saying ViaSocket is perfect or that it'll solve every workflow problem you have. But if you're spending too much time on repetitive tasks that could easily be automated, it's worth a shot. The learning curve isn't steep, and the time savings add up quickly.

I looked in the rear view mirror and no one was in line behind us. I said there’s no one behind so I’ll wait here and had my drinks in under 30 seconds. If I had gone and parked I would have been waiting 5 minutes. I understand they like to skew the wait times for corporate but doing it on an only drinks order is ridiculous.

  Sven  
  
  You’re a Lint-Licker  
  
  “Get on your knees,” I tell the blonde in front of me. One thing the women who want me to fuck them learn right away is that I don’t say anything twice. Watching her eyes flare, she drops to her knees and her hands go behind her back. Her thighs spread, showing off her bare pussy.  
  
  “Open your mouth,” I murmur, running my hand softly along her jaw in approval. When her head lifts and she looks up, I feed her my dick inch by inch until it hits the back of her throat. Hearing her gag, I pull back, only to surge forward again. “Lick it, just the tip,” I command, watching her tongue swirl around the crown then press into her mouth, letting my head fall back as she bobs up and down along my length until I feel that familiar rush in my spine.  
  
  “Stop,” I growl, pulling her to her feet, turning her to face my desk and bending her over the top. Hearing her moan I kick her feet apart and roll the condom on. My hands slide around her waist, one cupping her breasts and the other zeroing in on her clit, skimming over it as her hips tip back and I slide in. This is only about one thing; it’s only ever about one thing. Stroking in and out of her, I feel her walls begin to spasm as I plant myself to the hilt and drop forward, coming hard. I take a second to catch my breath, and I can still feel her shaking in my arms as I pull out and step back.  
  
  “You can go,” I tell her, pulling off the condom and tying it off before walking into the adjoining bathroom, tossing it in the toilet, and then washing my hands and dick.  
  
  “I can go?” she repeats, not moving away from my desk or adjusting her dress that is still up around her waist. Turning to look at her, I’m sure she’s someone’s daughter or sister; she may even be a nice girl, but she means nothing to me. Like all the other women that my security asks to come up here, they come without knowing anything about me except what the rumors are.  
  
  “Yes, you can go,” I tell her, tucking myself back in and adjusting my shirt before walking over to my desk and taking a seat.  
  
  “You’re a prick,” she mumbles, wiggling her dress back down over her ass and stomping in her heels across the carpet to her bag that she dropped on the couch when she came in.  
  
  “You got what you wanted,” I remind her as she angrily shoves her arm through the strap of her bag. I may be a dick, but I didn’t fill her head with false expectations before fucking her and telling her to get out. She knew what was going to happen before she walked her ass up the stairs to my office, or at least she had a good idea of what was going to occur, and I sure as hell didn’t force her to her knees to suck me off.  
  
  “Whatever,” she says, looking at me once more, and I know from the look in her eyes that all I’d have to do is call her back and she would come. Annoyed by that, I look down at the spreadsheet in front of me, hearing the door slam hard.  
  
  Turning my chair, I look out over the club through the large window. There are hundreds of people below and some nights, like tonight, I’ll scan the floor and tell my security which woman I want. They’ll approach her and give her the choice to come to me or not. I have never had a woman say no, and most of the time they leave happy. But then there are times they leave pissed, because they think their pussy is made of gold and I should ask for seconds or drop a ring on their finger. Scanning the club, a flash of light catches my attention, and my eyes land on a woman who is between two guys with her phone in her hand. She is pointing at them then her cell phone. Normally, I wouldn’t think much about it, but something in the woman’s eyes isn’t right. Picking the phone up off my desk, I dial two.  
  
  “Already on it,” Zack, the head of my security, states and hangs up. Moving back to the window, I watch Zack and Lane approach her through the crowd then frown. She’s not dressed like she’s out for a night of fun with her friends; she looks like she’s wearing pajamas, and not even the sexy kind. Living in Sin City, you see a lot of shit, and chicks show up to the club in the strangest outfits, especially if they are having a bachelorette party.  
  
  Once Zack reaches her, he shoves one of the guys toward Lane then bends his face toward the woman, who lifts her phone to him. Squinting, I try to make out what’s on the screen, but the distance and lighting in the club makes it difficult to see anything. Shaking his head, the woman points at the phone again, and Zack touches his ear as my desk phone rings.  
  
  “Yeah?”  
  
  “She’s looking for someone who drugged her sister,” Zack says over the music and the crowd downstairs.  
  
  “Drugged and beat the crap out of my sister, at this club,” the woman screams into the mic.  
  
  “Bring her up,” I snarl, hanging up the phone, lifting my jacket from the back of my chair, slipping it on, and then straightening my tie. I don’t need this shit—not right now, not while all this other shit is going on around me. Over the last few months, a multitude of women have been drugged while partying here, but no one has ever gotten hurt—no one I’m aware of anyway.  
  
  “Put me down right now!” the woman yells, kicking her feet and hitting Zack in the back as she enters my office over his shoulder. Lowering her to the ground, he grunts as she pokes him in his chest and yells, “I’m not paying for your chiropractor bills, you giant, overgrown jerk.”  
  
  “Miss, can you please have a seat?” I ask, and her head turns toward me, her big honey-colored eyes catching me off guard. Seeing the look in her gaze does some shit to my chest that makes me uncomfortable. Pulling my eyes from hers, I sweep them down the length of her body.  
  
  I have no fucking idea how she got into the club wearing pajamas, but she did. The blue plaid bottoms that are about four sizes too big are dragging under her flip-flops. The thin, tight, white tank top she has on allows a glimpse of her breasts and dark nipples. I wouldn’t say she’s fat; she’s all curves, with large breasts and wide hips. Her long, dark hair is in a low ponytail, and her face is round and soft, almost innocent-looking. She’s beautiful in a way I’m not accustomed to.  
  
  “How did you get in here?” I ask when my eyes meet hers once more.  
  
  “I paid the guy at the front a hundred dollars to let me in,” she says, glaring at me and crossing her arms over her chest, accentuating her cleavage. Looking over the top of her head, my eyes meet Zack’s and he nods before stepping out of the office, closing the door behind him.  
  
  “Do you want to tell me why you’re here?” I ask, taking a seat and motioning for her to do the same across from me.  
  
  “My sister was here earlier tonight,” she says, reaching into the top of her tank top, pulling out a cellphone that must be twenty years old, flipping it open, and shoving it across the desk. Picking the phone up, the grainy image of a smiling woman who looks similar to the one across from me is on the screen. She’s much slimmer than her sister, so slim she looks ill.  
  
  “You told Zack she was drugged here and beat up. If you don’t mind me asking, why aren’t the police here instead of you?” I query, watching her face close down almost instantly. “If this is some kind of ploy to get money, it won’t work,” I tell her, pushing the cell phone back across the top of the desk.  
  
  “A ploy to get money? Do you mean like blackmail?” she growls, grabbing the phone and clasping it tightly in her hand.  
  
  “That’s exactly what I mean.” I nod, watching her stand.  
  
  “You’re a…you’re a real lint-licker, you know that?” She paces in front of my desk, lifting her hand and pulling out her hair tie, allowing her mane to cascade down her back and over her shoulders.  
  
  “Lint-licker,” I repeat, trying not to smile as I watch h  
er.  
  
  “Lint-licker.” She nods then stops pacing and turns to look at me. “I don’t want money. The police won’t come, because my sister isn’t healthy. She has a drug problem, and they don’t care what happens to her. She’s just one more faceless druggie in a sea of fricking druggies. But I love her. She’s my sister, so I want to find the scum buckets who did what they did and turn them in myself,” she says, and my hackles instantly rise.  
  
  “You’re never coming back here again,” I snarl, standing and placing my hands on the top of my desk, leaning onto them.  
  
  “You can’t stop me.” She shrugs, and just like that, she turns her back on me and leaves my office before I can even comprehend what just happened. Following after her, I run downstairs through the crowded club. Once I reach the front entrance, I catch a glimpse of her right before she gets into a car the size of my desk and takes off down the street.  
  
  “Everything okay, Boss?” Turning my head to look over my shoulder, I glance at Zack and shake my head.  
  
  “She’s gonna be a problem,” I warn him, rubbing my chest as I head back inside.  
  
  \*  
  
  “Boss, she’s here again.” Glaring at Teo, who just stepped into my office, I turn to search through the large glass window that looks out over the club floor below. Spotting her sitting at the bar with a drink in front of her, I know it’s cranberry juice, the only thing she ever orders.  
  
  “Who the fuck let her in this time?” I ask turning around, watching Lane shrug and a smile with a twitch in his lips.  
  
  “Zack said he was going to ask Maggie if she wanted a job.” He smiles.  
  
  “Who the hell is Maggie?”  
  
  “The girl…that’s her name. Maggie.”  
  
  “You guys are on a first name basis now?” I ask, leaning back in my chair and tilting my head back, feeling a headache coming on.  
  
  “Well, she’s here everyday. It would be rude not to know her name.

This shit’s getting ridiculous,” I mutter to the ceiling. The damn woman has shown up every night over the last two weeks. She gets here when the club opens and stays ‘til closing. She no longer asks people if they know her sister, but she does inspect drinks, and talks to the women at the bar about making sure they are being safe. She is driving me fucking crazy.  
  
  “She’s kinda cute.” Lowering my head, I look at Teo and narrow my eyes, watching him raise his hands in front of him. “But she has a boyfriend,” he adds with a smile.  
  
  “Who?” I ask without thinking.  
  
  “Don’t know.” He shrugs, walking over to the window, looking down toward the bar.  
  
  “Well, the guy is obviously a piece of shit if he lets his woman out of the house every night to come to a club alone,” I mutter under my breath.  
  
  “What are you going to do about her?” he questions, turning to look at me.  
  
  “Give her a job,” I half joke. She’s persistent as fuck, and if things keep going the way they have been, she’s going to end up causing trouble, and I don’t need anymore trouble. At least, that’s the lie I’m telling myself.  
  
  “You do need a new assistant.”  
  
  “Fuck no,” I snap, loosening my tie. The last assistant I had ended up being a clusterfuck. The woman was pissed that I wouldn’t fuck her. I finally had to fire her ass when she brought another woman up to my office and proceeded to try and get me to join them on my couch when I walked in on them half naked. Work is work. Yes, I might invite women up to fuck, but never anyone I work with.  
  
  “It’s not like she’s your type,” he says, and I feel my jaw tick. “Besides, if she’s up here with you, she’ll stop harassing the women down there.” He nods toward where she’s sitting and my eyes follow the movement, seeing her talking to a girl who looks a little startled by whatever it is Maggie is telling her.  
  
  “It’s not happening. You guys need to keep her out of the club,” I tell him, turning away from the window.  
  
  “Just saying it would be a good way to keep an eye on her,” he gripes, patting my shoulder before leaving my office and closing the door behind him.  
  
  Letting out a frustrated breath, I turn away from the window and try to focus on all the shit I need to get done.  
  
  “Yeah,” I pick up my desk phone when it beeps and looking at the clock, seeing that an hour has passed since Teo left.  
  
  “Look out your window,” Zack says, and I spin my chair around and scan the floor, wondering what he wants me to see. Then I spot Maggie with a man’s head tucked under her arm as she leads him toward the front of the club, with Lane and Zack following closely behind them.  
  
  “What the fuck is going on?”  
  
  “That guy tried to put something in some chick’s drink, and Maggie saw him and went postal on his ass,” he explains almost proudly.  
  
  “Jesus Christ, what the fuck do I pay you for?” I gripe.  
  
  “I saw the whole thing. I was getting ready to step in when she stood up on her barstool, jumped on the guy’s back, and then did some fucking ninja shit, wrapping her arm around the guy’s head and forcing him to his knees. She won’t let him go. She said she wants to ask him some questions.”  
  
  “I’m on my way down,” I say, slamming down the phone and jerking open the door to my office, taking the stairs two at a time. Reaching the front of the club, I see Zack holding the guy and Lane’s arms wrapped around Maggie’s waist, trying to drag her away. What the fuck is going on?” I roar, and all eyes come to me except Maggie’s, who takes the opportunity to grab the man’s ear and twist, making him drop hard to the ground on his knees.  
  
  “You think it’s funny to drug innocent women, you flaming turd bucket?” she yells, hitting the top of the guy’s bald head, and Zack chuckles along with Lane, but I don’t see one damn thing that’s funny about this shit.  
  
  “Maggie, let him go and come here,” I growl, and she raises her eyes to meet mine, looking startled.  
  
  “He—”  
  
  “I said get your ass over here now!” I yell, cutting her off and feeling the vein in my neck bulge as I point to the ground at my feet.  
  
  “Fine.” She pouts, letting the guy go, walking sullenly toward me as Zack pulls the man to his feet, taking him with him around the corner, with Lane following behind them with his phone to his ear. I’m sure they are going to have a talk and wait for the cops.  
  
  “Let’s go,” I say, wrapping my hand around the back of her neck, leading her through the club and up the stairs to my office. Sitting her in the chair in front of my desk, I walk over to the cabinets where I keep my personal bottle of scotch and pull out the cap. I then lift the bottle to my lips, taking a swig while trying to calm down.  
  
  “Alcohol isn’t good for you,” she informs me as I take a seat behind my desk.  
  
  “Do I look like I give a fuck about that?” I ask her, taking another swig.  
  
  “You might not care about what it can do to your body right now, but you may want to know that it lowers sperm count and stamina in the long run.”  
  
  “Jesus.” I shake my head and rub my eyes in aggravation.  
  
  “Just saying it’s not good for you,” she mutters, dropping her eyes to her lap.  
  
  “What happened downstairs isn’t okay, Mags.”  
  
  “Maggie,” she corrects, still not looking at me.  
  
  “Whatever,” I drone, taking another swig. “You could have gotten hurt.”  
  
  “I have a black belt—”  
  
  “Look at me,” I demand, cutting her off and slamming the bottle down on the top of the desk, waiting for her eyes to meet mine. “You could have gotten hurt or worse. Do you understand that? He could have had a weapon on him.”  
  
  “You don’t understand,” she whispers as tears fill her eyes, but I harden myself against them, needing her to understand this isn’t a fucking movie. This is real life, and there are bad—really fucking bad—people in this world.  
  
  “You’re not allowed on the club floor anymore,” I state firmly.  
  
  “I’m going to find the guys who hurt my sister,” she states, and I see the determination in her eyes that make me proud and pissed at the same time.  
  
  “If you come, you come to my office, and if something happens down there”—I point to the club floor over my shoulder—“you’ll be the first to know.”  
  
  “Why would I come to your office? I need to be at the bar where I can see what’s going on.”  
  
  “You just got the job as my new assistant,” I tell her, watching her frown while wondering what the fuck I’m doing. This chick is a distraction I do not need right now, or ever for that matter.  
  
  “I already have a job,” she says as her frown grows deeper.  
  
  “Well, quit. You’re here every night, Mags, and you don’t leave ‘til the club closes at one. I can tell by the bags under your eyes that you’re exhausted.”  
  
  “Why would you want me to work here?” Now, isn’t that the million dollar question?  
  
  “Either take me up on my offer, or I’m going to have a restraining order placed against you and you won’t be allowed within a few hundred feet of the club.” I shrug like it’s all the same to me.  
  
  “You know this is malarkey, right?” she stands and I take her in fully for the first time tonight. Her loose, sheer, black dress is cinched with a thin belt emphasizing the dip in her waist between her full hips and breasts. Her hair is down in a mass of messy waves, and her makeup is subtle but still draws attention to her eyes, which look even more golden now that she’s standing in front of me looking pissed off.  
  
  “I’m not messing around with you anymore either. You take me up on my deal, or I’ll call the police and have them escort you off the premises,” I tell her, ignoring the fact I’m getting hard just looking at her.  
  
  “This is total crap,” she mumbles, looking around before meeting my eyes again.  
  
  “Take it or leave it.”  
  
  “Jeez, can I have a second to think?” she cries, and I feel my lips twitch, so I rub my hand down over my mouth to hide it.  
\>  
  “Ten,” I state, watching her eyes narrow. “Nine…eight…seven…” I continue counting, watching as she looks at me like she’s ready to kill me. “Six,” I raise a brow. “Five…”  
  
  “Fine!” she yells when I open my mouth to finish my countdown.  
  
  “Thought so,” I say triumphantly.  
  
  “You’re such a…you’re such a bigasterd,” she growls.  
  
  “A what?” I ask, and I can’t help it, I laugh at that one.  
  
  “When do I start?” she asks, ignoring my question while red spreads across her cheeks and down her neck.  
  
  “Tomorrow. Be here at five, and I’ll show you around the club and tell you your responsibilities.”  
  
  “Fine.”  
  
  “Now, let’s go. I have shit to do,” I tell her, standing and putting on my suit jacket.  
  
  “What?” she asks, backing up.  
  
  “I’m taking you to your car,” I tell her, walking past her toward the door.  
  
  “I can walk myself,” she says as her brows pull inward.  
  
  “Yeah, and I know you are your own brand of chaos, so I can’t leave you alone in the club until we build up the trust between us.”  
  
  “That is so…so stupid,” she mutters looking adorable.  
  
  “Now,” I tell her, swinging the door open and motioning her out ahead of me.  
  
  “Lint-licker,” she murmurs under her breath as she passes and then stomps down the stairs in front of me, giving me a view of her ass and legs that will be burned into my brain for years. Once we reach the club floor, I wrap my hand around the back of her neck, gaining a glare from her that I ignore as I lead her through the crowd.  
  
  Passing Teo, who is manning the front door, I give him a chin lift, watching his eyes dart between Maggie and me.  
  
  “You good?” I hear him ask, thinking he’s talking to me. I look at him like, Why the fuck are you asking that? Then I see his eyes are on Maggie.  
  
  “Yeah, thanks, Teo. Have a good night,” she says softly, smiling at him, which pisses me off.  
  
  “Where’s your car?” Her eyes fly to me, losing the softness instantly and she try’s to pull away.  
  
  “Down two blocks. I can walk myself. We’re outside, so you don’t have to worry about me causing any problems.”  
  
  “Come on.” I ignore her and take her hand, feeling the softness of it against my palm, and then tighten my fingers when she tries to pull away again.  
  
  Walking the two blocks, I try to understand what’s going on in my head. I have never let a woman effect me, but this woman has done just that without even realizing it, and I have no idea what the hell I’m going to do about it.  
  
  “This is my car,” she tells me, forcefully tugging her hand free of mine.  
  
  Looking at the car, my anger comes back tenfold. The thing looks like I could pick it up and toss it with one hand tied behind my back. It sure as hell doesn’t look safe for anyone to drive, especially in this town.  
  
  “What the hell is this?” I ask, watching her pull a key out of her bra—where I’m thinking she must keep everything, since the last time I was with her, that’s where her phone was.  
  
  “It’s a car.” She rolls her eyes.  
  
  “This is a death trap, Mags. One little bump in this piece of shit and you’re done,” I say, running a hand through my hair.  
  
  “It’s Maggie, M-A-G-G-I-E, Sven, and it’s safe. Plus, it’s good for the environment.”  
  
  “Yeah, because it kills people off, so there is one less person on Earth to fuck it up.”  
  
  “You’re very dramatic and you curse a lot,” she says, pushing me back a step, getting in behind the wheel, and slamming the door. Once the car is on, she rolls down the window. “See you tomorrow, Boss.”  
  
  “Drive carefully, and call the club when you get home,” I tell her, knowing she doesn’t have my cell number, which I’m going to have to fix tomorrow. Plus, I’ll get her a phone that isn’t from the dark ages and tell her it’s for work, because I know she won’t take it any other way.  
  
  “Yeah, I’m not calling you, but I’ll see you tomorrow,” she retorts and then pulls out of the small space, narrowly missing a car that’s passing by. Letting out an annoyed sigh, I turn and walk back to the club, mumbling under my breath the whole way, asking myself what the fuck am I doing?  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Maggie  
  
  Show Me the Money  
  
  Looking at myself in my full-length mirror, I turn to the side and make sure I look okay. Since I’m working with Sven, who I’ve seen wear nothing but suits, I chose to wear my sheer black sleeveless dress shirt with a high collar that ties with a bow at my neck. My cream-colored high-waisted skirt fits snuggly against my curves leaving my legs bare, showcasing one of my favorite pairs of leopard-print heels that have a pointy toe and a thin, spiked heel.  
  
  I left my long hair down except for my bangs, which I swept to the side and pinned back away from my face. I kept my makeup minimal, with just mascara and a little blush, not really in the mood to do a full face of makeup. Picking up my bag from my bed, I head into the living room where I find my sister, Morgan, sitting on the couch, watching TV. She has healed a lot over the last couple weeks, but she’s still carrying bruises that remind me of what could have happened, that I could have lost her.  
  
  “Are you going to work?” she asks, pressing pause on the show she’s watching.  
  
  “Yeah, there are leftovers in the fridge if you get hungry. I’m not sure what time I’ll be home, but if you need me, I have my cell on me,” I tell her as I pick up my car keys from the counter in the kitchen.  
  
  “I can take care of myself,” she grumbles, picking up a bag of Cheetos from the coffee table.  
  
  “I know,” I agree, not wanting to point out that she’s done a horrible job of taking care of herself so far.  
  
  “I may go out tonight,” she says casually as she un-pauses the show she’s watching.  
  
  “Where?” I ask while my tightly controlled facade slips.  
  
  “I don’t know. Amy called and said I needed to get out of the house, and I agreed with her.”  
  
  I hate my sister’s best friend. I’ve never trusted her, and anytime Morgan has gotten in trouble, Amy has been involved in one way or another. “You still have bruises from the last time you went out with her,” I point out hoping she will see for herself the kind of friend Amy really is.  
  
  “It’s not fair for you to make what happened seem like Amy’s fault.”  
  
  “Will you call and tell me where you’re going?” I ask, knowing it’s completely pointless to argue with her about her relationship with Amy. I don’t think she will ever see how being friends with her is affecting her.  
  
  “I’ll call,” she says absently while shoving her hand into the bag of Cheetos on her lap and looking at the TV.  
  
  “Love you,” I tell her, getting a nod in return before heading out the front door and down the stairs to my car.  
  
  Walking into Sven’s office, I fight the instinct to turn around and run right back out when I see he’s on the phone. I have no idea what I was thinking agreeing to come work for him, but then again, my life has been a series of events just like this one.  
  
  “Hold on, Mags,” he says, startling me.  
  
  Pulling his phone away from his ear, he motions for me to take a seat in one of the two dark blue, velvet high-back chairs in front of his large oak desk. Rolling my eyes at him, I take a seat, watching the corner of his mouth lift before he covers it with his hand. I hate that he calls me Mags—or that’s what I’m telling myself, anyway. But then again, it’s better than the nickname my parents gave me at my spirit ceremony, when they called down the moon goddess while standing naked in the middle of a field on my tenth birthday. I think I’m still traumatized by that experience.  
  
  Crossing one leg over the other I pull in a breath while I study him. Sven is gorgeous in a way that is completely unfair to the rest of the men on Earth. He’s tall enough that I could wear my six-inch heels and he would still tower over me. His body is lean, with just the right amount of muscle. His  
dark blond hair is overgrown on top and little shorter on the sides, giving him an unkempt, sexy look. His eyes are a startling blue that look green when he’s angry, and the long, dark lashes that surround them make them appear that much more enticing.  
  
  His nose is straight, his cheekbones are high, and his lips are full and are surrounded by a five o’clock shadow that takes his hotness up a few notches. He looks like he could be on the cover of GQ—hell, for all I know, he has been on the cover. The few nights I sat down at the bar, I heard women talk about him, and from what I gathered most of the female population of Vegas knows who he is. I swear every single leggy blonde, redhead, and brunette knew exactly who he was by name, and judging by the way they spoke about him, they probably screamed it a few times.  
  
  “Nice of you to show up, Mags,” he says, pulling me out of my perusal and setting his phone on top of the desk. Sitting up a little taller, I narrow my eyes and watch as he walks around the desk toward me, unbuttoning his suit jacket and taking a seat on top of the wooden surface, leaning a little closer than necessary.  
  
  “You said be here at five it’s five.” I hold up my hand when it looks like he’s going to say something else. “And we need to discuss my salary,” I state, uncrossing my legs then re-crossing them in the other direction, ignoring the way his eyes watch the movement and change color.  
  
  “Salary?” He frowns, and I can’t help the smile that forms on my lips at the confusion on his face.  
  
  “Yes, my salary. I mean, you didn’t actually think I was going to come work for you for free, did you?” I ask, raising my brow.  
  
  “Of course not. I’ll start you off at thirty-five thousand—”  
  
  “Yeah, that’s not going to work for me. At my old job, the one I just quit to come work for you, I made one hundred and seventy-five thousand a year, with four weeks paid vacation and one week sick pay,” I say, cutting him off. I actually make much more than that modeling, but he doesn’t need to know that.  
  
  “Where the hell did you work?” he growls, making my girly parts tingle.  
  
  Ignoring my body’s reaction to him, I wave my hand around in front of me and continue, “That doesn’t matter now, so since I’m just starting out here, I’ll take one hundred and fifty thousand, but I want the same for paid days off, including sick days.”",1,1756664460.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

now, i’m the only person in the building on 3rd shift. naturally, i do the late check-ins, address any guest concerns or complaints, security guard the building, run 2 FOSSE backups, 2 50-page packet scans, and then 2 rounds of making corrections to the scans through Excel. on top of that, i’ll tackle light houseman duties, dry/fold towels if time allows, first round of daily coffee, and set out a pretty heft breakfast spread. thankfully we have at least 1 daily kitchen attendant, so i don’t have to nuke eggs or sausage sandwiches in the morning unless someone calls out. 

i was trained to only use the desk computer stations to run audit and backups; less having to run around between multiple open terminals out front and in the back. more face-time in visible areas for the guests. yada yada yada. i think i’m at the point of, if i stop moving during my shift, i’ll fall asleep from sheer over-exhaustion. 

we (very) recently had a desk manager join our team, and she was very curious about this. she said it didn’t make sense, and that all of the audit shifts she pulled at prior properties were done exclusively from the boffice. chairs, quiet area away from guests, and ability to swap over to personal tasks a bit easier. our lobby is pretty open concept, with 2 seating areas next to an open desk, so it can get loud in the immediate area while trying to work. 

i know what i like and will continue to do, but what about you? do you ride the desk for your computer work and to get around the building easier? or take it into the office and have audit be your more exclusive focus? ",1,1756664430.0,askhotels,2,0.67,False

1n51xmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1n51xmw/fifty_first_times_by_molly_mcadams_read_free/,Fifty First Times by Molly McAdams Read Free online,"WALKING INTO A high school kegger was as close to being a goddess as I’d ever get, because nothing parted the sea of my drunk-ass former peers like the arrival of someone who had gotten the hell out of Beauford, Texas. Someone who had done that should be venerated, since it was no small feat.  
  
  Especially for a girl.  
  
  So I strutted through the crowd in my knee-high suede boots and a way-too-short checked skirt from Anthropologie, thankful that a finished semester at UCLA had garnered me some confidence along with a closetful of my roommate’s castoffs. I was probably the only person in the room whose wardrobe wasn’t one hundred percent courtesy of Kmart.  
  
  In this moment, it didn’t matter that I’d spent the previous four years with my nose stuck in a book, or that I hadn’t been on the cheerleading squad—one of the three extracurriculars deemed appropriate for girls as Title IX had never gotten past the school board’s iron curtain. Beauford was a small town, so I knew everyone and everyone knew me, but I wasn’t the type that got drunk on the weekends or the girl who climbed into the bed of her boyfriend’s truck. It was exactly my lack of notoriety that got me out of Texas in the first place and made me a legend tonight. Only two people in our graduating class had succeeded in landing tickets out of town. It was a record year for Beauford High School.  
  
  “Jacqueline Kelly!” A blond mop of hair attacked me with such force that I nearly fell over.  
  
  “Tasha,” I said, laughing as I peeled myself off her. “You’re going to kill me.”  
  
  “I’m not the one wearing sex-me-up boots.” She fanned herself dramatically as she linked her arm through mine and dragged me toward the back patio. It was unoccupied save for a few stoners who fled as soon as Tasha glared at them. Even though it was December, it was still warm enough in South Texas to sit outside, but someone had built a fire in the fire pit for good measure. “You look incredible. Chic and sophisticated. You’re a woman of the world.”  
  
  I tugged at my jean jacket self-consciously. It was one thing to walk into a room of near strangers and feel like the center of the universe, but sitting here with one of the few friends I’d left behind, I was suddenly aware of how much had changed and how much hadn’t. “I don’t know about that.”  
  
  “Whatever,” Tasha said. “California looks good on you. Although I have no clue why you came back to good ole Buttford.”  
  
  “Christmas, remember?” A snort escaped my nose as I tried to hold down a giggle.  
  
  We’d coined that word “Buttford” when we were five, and it still made me laugh. Trust Tasha to remind me of exactly who I was within five minutes of seeing her. She was that type—the girl who put everyone at ease. And fifty years from now she’d still be in Beauford. Girls like Tasha were the heart of small towns like ours. Something always caught them young, growing roots so deep that there was no hope of transplant.  
  
  “Where’s Jesse?” I asked her.  
  
  Tasha shrugged, but her face lit up a little. Tasha’s face had been lighting up for Jesse Buchanan since third grade. Jesse was Tasha’s root system. “Around here somewhere, acting like a damned fool, I’m sure.”  
  
  That sounded about right.  
  
  “Want a drink?”  
  
  She laughed at me, but she stopped when I stared at her in confusion. Tasha had been the get-drunk-on-the-weekends type. For a second her face mirrored mine before she squealed and grabbed my hand. “What am I thinking?” she exclaimed. “You’ve been gone. Jesse and I ran off to Oklahoma! It’s the Las Vegas of the Midwest.”  
  
  That was when I saw the glint of silver on her left hand. Nothing about Jesse Buchanan and Tasha Barnes running off together should surprise me, but I couldn’t quite attach reality to the idea. I had a married friend?  
  
  I had a married friend.  
  
  Question, statement of fact—it didn’t seem to matter. My biggest decision to make at the moment was whether to stay on the university meal plan. Tasha had actually vowed to stay with the same person for the rest of her life.  
  
  I really needed that drink.  
  
  “Congrats! I think that deserves a toast,” I managed to mumble.  
  
  “Maybe it does, but—” Tasha patted her belly.  
  
  “Ohmigod!” I blinked at her, my eyes flashing from her face to the hand resting on her stomach to her face again, waiting for her to say it.  
  
  “I’m due in April,” she told me as the strangest smile settled onto her face. She looked like one of those paintings of the Madonna hanging in a gallery.  
  
  “That’s awesome!” I gave her a quick hug around the shoulders and muttered a jumbled be-right-back.  
  
  I’d been gone for five months and a girl I’d played kickball with at recess was married and knocked up. I was definitely back in Beauford, Texas.  
  
  And then it hit me like a ton of bricks.  
  
  I was back in Beauford, Texas.  
  
  I had returned to a town that was still reeling from the closure of a mannequin factory ten years ago. Beauford was the kind of place where boys were taught that football was religion and girls still took home economics. I’d fought tooth and nail to get out of here and now I’d waltzed back into town eager to show off, hoping I might run into the one person I’d been avoiding for months. But there was no way he was going to be here, because he was smart enough not to come back home, even for a holiday. Once you got out of Beauford, you stayed out.  
  
  Calm down, Jac, I ordered myself. It’s Christmas. That’s all.  
  
  I grabbed for a passing tray, scooping up two Dixie cups and quickly swallowing back the Jell-O shots before I found a beer.  
  
  It wasn’t just being back in Beauford though. I knew that. It was feeling like I was stuck between two stages in my life as though I was waiting for a light to change on the corner of first and second. Who cared if Tasha was pregnant? She was still sweet Tasha Barnes. Buchanan, I corrected myself. She was Tasha Buchanan now.  
Pushing my way through the crowd, I found her lounging in a plastic patio chair.  
  
  “I wasn’t sure if you were coming back,” she said as I pulled another lawn chair up beside her.  
  
  “Sorry. I was a little . . . surprised.” It felt nice to admit it.  
  
  “I was, too. I mean they tell you you can get pregnant, but I never really thought about it.” Tasha’s hand was resting peacefully on her stomach still. If she was upset about the baby, it didn’t show.  
  
  “Was it an accident?” I asked, but I wished immediately that I could take the question back.  
  
  Tasha giggled and shook her head. “It wasn’t exactly planned, but considering we were fucking like bunnies as soon as we came back with that marriage certificate, I can’t really say it was an accident.”  
  
  We lapsed into silence after that. I couldn’t wrap my head around it. Tasha was going to have a baby. She was married, and I hadn’t even . . .  
  
  Hell, I couldn’t even finish the thought.  
  
  “You seen Wes?” she asked me as though she could read my mind.  
  
  I shook my head so violently that the beer I was holding spilled onto my lap. “We don’t keep in touch. New York is pretty far away.”  
  
  “I thought maybe you two were getting together,” Tasha said. “These things weren’t really your scene back in the day.”  
  
  Back in the day? Had I imagined the wistful tone in her words? Sure, I hadn’t been one to go out partying. In fact, I’d only gotten drunk once before leaving for college, and it was the memory of that night which made it completely and totally impossible that I was here to see Wesley Asher.  
  
  Tasha raised an eyebrow, her face shadowy in the night. I guess it was my turn to surprise her. Wes and I had been inseparable once. Best friends. He was the reason I’d managed to stay focused enough to get out of Beauford and get into UCLA on scholarship. He’d kept me from going goo-goo-eyed over a boy, and I’d done the same for him with girls. Consequently, we had secured a matching set of get-out-of-Texas-free cards. Mine courtesy of UCLA and his from NYU.  
  
  And I hadn’t thought about him in seven months. I hadn’t let myself. A jagged pain tore through my chest thinking about him now.  
  
  “I just thought I’d stop by,” I said. “Is Wes back in town?”  
  
  Why had I asked her that? I didn’t care if Wes was in town or not.  
  
  “ ’Course he’s in town,” Tasha said. “He’s here tonight.”  
  
  My vision swam and for a moment I forgot that I’d had two strong Jell-O shots and most of a beer. Instead I was back in a nondescript room at the Holiday Inn, rolling in my underwear on the queen-sized bed and swigging out of a nearly empty bottle of Boone’s Farm. I’d lost my dignity that night, but that was all I ended up losing.  
  
  “Oh.” It was the only word I could remember in that moment.  
  
  “Sorry.” Tasha leaned forward and bit her lip. “I didn’t realize.”  
  
  “Realize what?” I asked, already planning my exit strategy. If I was careful I could climb over the padlocked gate and bypass reentering the party altogether.  
  
  “That you were still in love with him.”  
  
  Whatever I thought she was apologizing for, that was not one of the possibilities. “I’m not in love with him!”  
  
  Tasha looked like she felt sorry for me.  
  
  “I’m not!” I repeated. Wanting to see him didn’t mean I was in love with him.  
  
  Her gaze drifted from me and paused on something over my shoulder. “Good, because he’s coming this way,” she announced.  
  
  I shot to my feet. “I need to go to the bathroom.” But as I turned to scurry inside, I came face to face with Wes.  
  
  No, that wasn’t quite right. I had to look up to Wes, which was a first. He must have grown half a foot since I saw him last. I didn’t even know growth spurts were possible at our age.  
  
  “What they got in that New York water?” Tasha struggled onto her feet, looking more pregnant than she had five minutes ago. Or was I that oblivious?  
  
  “God knows,” Wes drawled. Half a year in New York and he still sounded like a South Texas boy. I bet that drove the girls up there nuts. That and the fact that his new height had lengthened his torso, and if I wasn’t mistaken, he’d clearly been working out. A set of nicely chiseled abs were visible under his tight, gray V-neck. Gone were the baggy, plaid shirts of high school; Wes looked every bit the New Yorker from his artfully tousled dark hair to his tight jeans. The boy who took me to prom last year was all legs and arms—a tangle of awkward, skinny limbs. The man standing in front of me now was anything but a boy.  
  
  His brown eyes skimmed over me, but his face remained passive. “Jac, it’s nice to see you.” Cold. Informal. There was no hint of friendliness in his tone, even though up until seven months ago we’d been best friends. Could I blame him for avoiding me after that awful night? I hadn’t even tried to see him before I left town.  
  
  Wes turned his attention back to Tasha, and as he did I noticed faint stubble peppering his jawline. It was dark black like his hair. “I hear there are congratulations in order.”  
  
  “Someone has to stay in Beauford and have babies.” Tasha smiled as she patted her belly. “With you two gone, we were going to have to redo the population sign.”  
  
  “I only went to college. I haven’t left forever,” Wes said, but I heard the lie in his words. He’d take Texas with him wherever he went. I knew that, but I also understood that there was no going back to a town like Beauford after you’d escaped it.  
  
  Just the thought of leaving school had made the air around me feel heavy and too hot. I was too far from the ocean here, and the world of Beauford felt dry and beige, each piece of its landscape a muted shade of brown. I didn’t know how Wes felt about New York, but I already ached for the vibrant sprawl of LA and its tall, yawning palm trees. I even missed the billboards pressuring you to see the latest Hollywood release or watch the newest fall television show. Soft, sandy beaches and the Santa Monica pier.  
  
  “Yeah, you have,” Tasha said in a soft voice, but before he could deny it, she held her hands up to stop her. “I don’t blame you. I just wish you’d gone together.”  
  
  I wished the ground would crack open and swallow me up. We were never together.  
  
  Wes and I had made a pact to lose our V-cards on prom night, which other than being a bit cliché was the perfect solution to our predicament. There was no way in hell either of us was sticking around for the other person, and that meant no chance of getting trapped in Beauford.  
  
  No one in Beauford’s 2013 graduating class was a virgin—except Wes and me. And if everyone in a podunk town in Texas had done it, sure as shit everyone in two of the largest colleges in the country had, except for maybe the super-religious types. Plus I’d known Wes forever. If I couldn’t strip down and let him stick me with it, how would I ever expect to lose it in LA among my vastly more experienced classmates? After all, my roommate, Jen, had already done it with three different guys.  
  
  “Now y’all are on the opposite sides of the Earth.” Tasha interrupted my thoughts. New York and LA were hardly the other sides of the world, but I bet it felt that way standing in Beauford.  
  
  “I’m not really a California kinda guy.” But his face said something else: I’m not really a Jacqueline kinda guy.  
  
  He had made that clear on prom night when he’d failed to follow up on our plan and reinforced his rejection by dropping me off the next morning and avoiding me for the last seven months.  
  
  “Excuse me.” I held my cup upside down. “Empty.”  
  
  “When did you start drinking?” Wes asked, frowning as I pushed past him.  
  
  About the same time you became a dick. I wanted to say it out loud, but I couldn’t, and I knew if I did, I would cry. In the kitchen, a group had gathered to play quarters and I jumped in, pretending like I knew how to play. Before long I’d lost track of how many beers I’d had to chug. A guy from my graduating class stood behind me, hovering close to my ear and urging me to drink more. I was just about to start on a line of shots when Wes yanked me a  
way.  
  
  “What are you doing?” I yelled at him, trying to pull free.  
  
  “I’m getting you out of here before you make a fool out of yourself.” He led me toward the front door, past Tasha and Jesse, who were saying their good-byes to a few people. Tasha reached to hug Wes, giving me the chance to run. But all I did was take a few shaky steps back.  
  
  “I don’t need you to take care of me.”  
  
  From the look on Tasha’s face, I realized that my words had sounded clearer in my head, but I put a hand on my hip, hoping to look assertive.  
  
  “This is not you.” Wes’s voice was calm and even. I bet he hadn’t had a drop tonight.  
  
  “How would you know? You haven’t talked to me in seven months.”  
  
  “Why are you drinking like this?” Wes challenged me.  
  
  “I’m drinking like this because you didn’t fuck me!” I was pretty wasted, but even I knew that everyone was staring. So much for my goddess status.  
  
  And then Wes did the last thing I would have ever expected. He walked over, grabbed me around the waist, and threw me over his shoulder, carting me out the front door to the cheers of the crowd.  
  
  I tried to kick at him, but my coordination had been undermined by the drinking games.  
  
  “Stop,” he said.  
  
  “Where are you taking me?” I shrieked as he dropped me into the passenger seat of his rusty F–150. “I have got a cell phone with tracking enabled on it.”  
  
  “Jacqueline Kelly, you’ve known me since we were six weeks old,” Wes said as he slid behind the wheel and shoved his keys in the ignition. “I’m not a serial killer.”  
  
  “Take me home,” I commanded him.  
  
  “You smell like you fell into that keg,” he reminded me.  
  
  Good point. My mom would flip if I came home like this.  
  
  “I’m taking you by Queenie’s. You need something in your stomach.”  
  
  I didn’t try to argue with him, and when we pulled into Queenie’s drive-in, the familiar scent of fries and burgers made my mouth water. Wes ordered enough food to feed the football team, but when it came I ate more than I thought possible. This is so good,” I told him, my mouth half full of french fries.  
  
  “There are a lot of great places to eat in New York,” Wes said, “but I’ve never found a Queenie’s.”  
  
  “In-N-Out is pretty good, but nothing touches Queenie’s,” I agreed.  
  
  “So about the party—” Wes began.  
  
  “Ohmigod!” I shook my head. “Please do not sully Queenie’s with my idiocy.”  
  
  The effects of the booze were starting to wear thin. I knew I was still drunk, but my head was less fuzzy now, and the last thing I wanted to do was relive that moment, especially what I said to Wes.  
  
  “The last time I saw you, you were drunk.” Wes was clearly not going to drop this. “Do you drink like that at UCLA?”  
  
  “Not really,” I admitted. “This was my first real party of the semester.”  
  
  Wesley snorted and turned his attention to the window. “So what does it mean that the last two times you’ve seen me, you’ve gotten wasted?”  
  
  I froze, my lips poised over the straw of my milkshake. I didn’t really have an answer for him.  
  
  “Because to me”—Wes twisted in his seat to face me, dropping his eyes to meet mine—“it feels like you have to be drunk to be near me.”  
  
  I wasn’t sure if that was true. I hadn’t really thought about it. “We spent a lot of time together studying and hanging out,” I reminded him. “I wasn’t drunk then.”  
  
  “Yeah, but that was before.” He settled back, drumming the steering wheel with his thumbs. “Before we decided on that stupid plan.”  
  
  “That plan wasn’t stupid,” I blurted out. “I’m still a virgin, you know!”  
  
  “It’s not a terminal illness,” Wes said.  
  
  “It feels like it sometimes.” I finally took a drink of the milkshake. The alcohol still buzzing in my brain made it hard not to say whatever came into my head, and try as I might I couldn’t hold back the one question I was dying for him to answer. “Are you?”  
  
  “A virgin?” Wes paused before he answered, but then he shook his head slowly.  
  
  I felt the most peculiar urge to throw up, cry, and laugh at the same time. By the time, I realized which bodily movement was going to win out, I’d managed to yank open the door and aim my Queenie’s at the parking lot.  
  
  “You’ll feel better now,” Wes said, skirting around our previous topic of conversation and handing me a cup of water. He threw the truck in reverse as I slammed the door, and rumbled down the street without another word. A minute later we were parked in front of the Stop-N-Go. Wes disappeared inside the store and came back with a bottle of water and a travel toothbrush set.  
  
  “Thanks,” I mumbled. Maybe it was the booze, but hot tears were creeping into the corners of my eyes. It was such a Wes thing to do.  
  
  I brushed my teeth while hanging out the window of his truck. It’s amazing how something as simple as minty toothpaste can change your outlook on life.  
  
  “You up for some driving or are you ready to go home?” he asked me as we turned down a gravel road.  
  
  I wasn’t sure how to answer that question. On one hand, I could probably pass out the second my head hit a pillow. On the other hand, it was barely past eleven o’clock, and my mom might still be awake.  
  
  “I don’t want to go home,” I said, “but I’m not sure this road is doing much for my stomach.”  
  
  “I know just the place.”  
  
  We lapsed into silence as I let him drive me so far outside town that the sky grew black with night save for a few specks of starlight.  
  
  “There is nowhere in LA that ever gets this dark.” I leaned forward, pressing my face to the cool glass and trying to see past the road.  
  
  “Can’t be worse than New York. Nothing closes down there, especially the lights. It’s great for a two A.M. hot dog run, but . . .”  
  
  “You never feel alone,” I finished for him.  
  
  “But you always feel alone,” he added.  
  
  It was exactly how I felt—swallowed up by the chaos of the city, constantly surrounded by people, bombarded by their energy, and still invisible. “Sometimes I like it,” I told him. “If I want to disappear, all I have to do is walk down the street.”  
  
  “It took me a while, but now the noise just blends together and I zone out.” He stopped the truck and climbed out, coming around to open my door. I wasn’t sure why I waited for him to do that, except that girls expected guys in Beauford to open doors. “But you can’t hear the crickets in New York.”  
  
  He helped me down and we stood on the edge of the gravel where the prairie grass started and listened to the sharp symphony of cricket songs and rustling leaves. Wes took my hand and pulled me into the field.  
  
  “I think this is the start to every horror movie I’ve ever seen,” I warned him.  
  
  Wes chuckled at that, but kept going. “You have no idea where we are, do you?”  
  
  “The set of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?”  
  
  “Everybody in California have a smart mouth like you?” he asked.  
  
  “Nah. Most of them are too busy being tall and beautiful to have much to say.”  
  
  “I guess it’s lucky that you’re a triple threat then.”  
  
  I didn’t ask him what he meant by that. I wasn’t sure I wanted to know, because I liked what it implied and I didn’t know how to feel about that. Wes was my best friend. As in past tense. We’d spent too long not speaking for me to consider us close anymore, so the man dragging me out into a dark field, visible only from the shine of moonlight on his glossy hair, seemed like a foreigner to me. Wes was still in there, but his shell had been replaced by a man. An admittedly hot one that did funny things to my stomach. I couldn’t help but wonder if he felt the same about me.  
  
  The field stretched far until a small grove of trees broke it up, and just like that, I knew exactly where we were—back in another time and place.  
  
  “I can’t believe I didn’t recognize your family’s road,” I said.  
  
  “It was dark.” But his words were wounded. A lot had changed between us, even our shared history seemed to have dissolved into a half-remembered past. Wes pointed his phone toward a tree, the glow from the screen just bright enough to reveal an old tree house.  
  
  “You could have used that when you were dragging me through the field,” I said as I grabbed for the phone.  
  
  “It was a surprise.” Wes caught me around the waist and pulled me closer to him. “And I wanted to see if you’d follow me.”  
  
  “Anywhere.” The word was out of my mouth before I’d even processed it.  
  
  Wes leaned closer to me, his lips inches from mine. “Is that so, Jacqueline Kelly?”  
  
  My breath hitched in my throat, and I wanted him to kiss me. The desire consumed me, drowning out everything around us.  
  
  “Sure.” I pulled away from him and ran toward the makeshift rungs still nailed to the tree. “Anytime you’re in Los Angeles.”  
  
  I climbed as quickly as the darkness would allow me to, and when I reached the top, I took a tentative step inside. This tree house was well over fifteen years old, a gift to Wes’s older brothers. But I was surprised to see a few toys and books strewn in the corner and a large, well-worn blanket laid out on the floor.  
  
  “My nephew uses it,” Wes said as he stepped in behind me.  
  
  The fact that kids were still climbing into tree houses in Beauford, Texas brought a smile to my face.  
  
  “Do you remember when we ran away from home to live here?” I asked him, dropping to sit cross-legged.  
  
  “It took our parents a whole hour to find us,” he said, joining me on the blanket.  
  
  “We didn’t think it through.”  
  
  “I bet we could pull it off now. Run away for good,” he said.  
  
  “Haven’t we already done that?” I asked in a quiet voice.  
  
  “We’re both back in Beauford.”  
  
  “Only physically,” I said. “I bet your head’s in New York. Maybe even your heart.”  
  
  Wes had admitted he wasn’t a virgin anymore, which meant there was a good chance that there was  
a girl back at NYU. That thought twisted inside of me and turned my stomach sour.  
  
  “My heart is right here.” He placed a hand over his chest.  
  
  “So she wasn’t anyone special?” My mind was locked on imagining what she looked like, how they had met, what her name was.  
  
  “Huh?”  
  
  “You said you lost your virginity,” I reminded him, struggling to push the words past my lips.  
  
  “Oh, that.” His voice was flat and he shrugged, looking past me and out at the starry night above us. “I don’t remember much. It was the first and last time I went drinking in the city. She seemed nice. We went out for coffee, but we couldn’t find five things we had in common. She wanted to nail a Texas cowboy.”  
  
  The revelation caught me by surprise, and I snorted. “I’m so sorry,” I said, trying to hold back laughter. “But you are hardly a Texas cowboy.”  
  
  “I have the Beauford drawl.” He lengthened each word into sweet, Southern syrup. “Let’s just say it was enough to cross it off the bucket list.”  
  
  I was hanging on his every word, leaning closer to him, and I pulled back, glad he couldn’t see that I was blushing.  
  
  “So you haven’t yet?” he asked.  
  
  I shook my head, feeling the nervous excitement in my stomach shift back to embarrassment. “Nope.”  
  
  I waited for him to tell me it wasn’t a big deal. To just get it over with already, but instead he nodded as though he approved of this answer.  
  
  “Do you remember prom night?” he asked me.  
  
  “I remember I wore that awful lime green dress my mom bought me in Galveston,” I said. “And the wilted salad and the eighties pop music.” I left out the part where I sweet-talked Tasha into stealing a bottle of cheap wine from Jesse and that I’d planned to get drunk to steady my nerves, so that I could go through with our plan. I didn’t mention waking up in that wrinkled lime green dress, very much intact, the next morning and spotting him curled up asleep on the pull-out sofa in the hotel room.  
  
  “I should’ve called you,” he said. “After that night, I was so angry. It took me a while to realize I was angry at myself, not you. By then we were on opposite coasts.”  
  
  “You didn’t get blitzed out of your mind on Boone’s Farm. I don’t think I was ready,” I said. “Or I wouldn’t have been such a jackass.”  
  
  “I knew you were drinking and I didn’t stop you. I knew you were nervous,” he admitted.  
  
  “How?”  
  
  “Because I was nervous, too.” His lips curled into a shy smile. “It took me a while to understand why I was nervous though.”  
  
  “Is that why you dragged me out of that party tonight?” I asked him. “To avoid seeing me get trashed again?”  
  
  He nodded. “And it’s why I’ve been sobering you up for the last three hours.”  
  
  “Three hours?” I repeated in disbelief. We’d been up to Queenie’s and driven around for a while, but it was hard to believe it had been three hours. That explained why the happy, boozy haze had lifted as the conversation grew more serious. “I guess you don’t have to worry about taking me home to my mom now.”  
  
  “I have a confession.” His fingers trailed along my thigh as he spoke, and I felt his touch shivering through my skin. “I had another reason for sobering you up.”  
  
  I could barely concentrate with his fingers running along my skin. “Which is?”  
  
  His mouth closed over mine with gentle but demanding force, and I crumbled crumpled against him. My hands fell limply to my sides, the kiss stealing every ounce of control I had over my body. I was entirely his in that moment as his hands moved to cup my face. Another three hours could have passed—maybe an eternity—but when he broke that kiss, it was entirely too soon.  
  
  It wasn’t the first time Wesley Asher kissed me in this tree house, but it was the first time I didn’t want him to stop.  
  
  “I’ve wanted to do that for a long time, Jac.” He whispered the words against my neck, his breath warm on my skin.  
  
  I couldn’t swallow back the question on my lips. “Why didn’t you want me on prom night?”  
  
  “You think I didn’t want you?” Wes laughed as though I’d said something outrageous. “I wanted you so much that I couldn’t do it, because I wanted more than one night with you. We spent a lot of time dreaming about our futures away at big colleges, and I realized on prom night that you saw separate futures, and I didn’t. I thought I could live without you if I didn’t kiss you, if I didn’t make love to you. I was wrong.”  
  
  It was as though he lifted a veil inside my head, revealing something I’d tried to hide from myself. When I left for California, I wasn’t just running away from Beauford. I was running away from Wes.  
  
  I didn’t wait for him to kiss me again. Instead I climbed onto his lap and wrapped my arms around his neck, bringing my lips to his in a crush of urgency. His hands settled on my hips, and he pulled me to him until our bodies couldn’t press any closer together.  
  
  “I’m home for three weeks,” Wes said, drawing back slightly. “We don’t have to do this tonight.”  
  
  I shook my head, fumbling in his arms until my fingers found the hem of my shirt. Wes bit his lip as I tugged it over my head. “That’s just it. When you finally realize you’re ready, you don’t want to wait a second longer.”  
  
  Wes didn’t need further coercion. His fingers slipped under the band of my bra, unhooking it. I let it fall off my shoulders and onto the ground as his hands traveled to my breasts. He cupped them gingerly, brushing his thumb over my nipple. I moaned at his touch. I’d never taken my shirt off in front of a guy, let alone allowed someone to touch me like this, and there was no chance I was stopping now.  
  
  His arms cradled my back and he laid me against the floor, hesitating at the zipper of my skirt, waiting for me to nod. He continued undressing me until I was down to my suede boots. I raised my eyebrows at him.  
  
  “You can keep those on,” he said in a low voice as he stripped off his own shirt to reveal a stack of abs that hadn’t been there on prom night. Then he was over me, our mouths moving together as our bodies twisted into each other. Thick denim rubbed my naked thighs, and I strained against him. He traced the nape of my neck with the rough pad of his thumb before his fingers closed around the back of my neck, holding my head in place as his tongue dipped into my mouth. My own hands found his fly. Tugging it down, I slipped my hand into his boxers, surprised to discover he was already hard, but then again I didn’t have any experience with this kind of thing. I took him in my hand, a thrill of nerves flooding through me.  
  
  It was a heady feeling, lying here nearly stark-ass naked with Wesley Asher. I’d thought once that sex with him would be a simple in-and-out experience. Now that my boots were wrapped around his back, I didn’t want it to end.  
  
  “Are you sure?” Wes whispered in my ear.  
  
  “Yes,” I said so loudly that heat crept onto my cheeks. Thankfully it was too dark for him to see.  
  
  Pushing up to his knees, he pulled out his wallet to retrieve a condom. He tossed the wallet aside and pushed down his pants. Seeing him naked made me oddly shy, but I couldn’t look away, even as he rolled the condom on.  
  
  Wes moved forward and positioned himself carefully against me. He nudged me, and burning erupted between my legs, but not the sexy kind. I mean I’d heard that it hurt, but holy hell, it hurt! With his free hand he stroked the side of my thigh as though to reassure me.  
  
  “You okay?” he asked me.  
  
  I nodded, even as tears smarted at the corner of my eyes. But these weren’t tears from the pain, even though ouch! Slowly, he pushed in a bit farther but with a little more force. For a moment, it felt as though I was being ripped open. I gasped, drawing in a long, ragged breath. Then he was inside me, steady and still, as he dropped to hover over me. Wes kissed away my tears and reached for my hand, pulling it to his chest where he held it as I adjusted to the sensation of him.  
  
  Then he began to move slowly. It hurt less, shifting to something that was almost pleasant—a fullness, or rather a wholeness th  
at I’d never felt before. His forehead pressed against mine, slick with sweat, and his breath quickened as his hands grabbed my hips. But even as a tremor shuddered through his body, he remained in control, not pushing my body for more than it could handle. And then it was over.  
  
  He withdrew carefully, asking once more if I was okay, but I was too dazed to answer him. Lying down, he tucked me against him as I tried to process my thoughts into words but nothing came.  
  
  “How do you feel?” he finally asked me.  
  
  “I’m not sure. I thought I would feel different afterward, but I don’t. But then again I do.” My answer was hesitant, full of stops and pauses.  
  
  He brushed a strand of hair from my face. “You’re still you, Jac.”  
  
  “But everything’s changed and nothing has,” I said, still struggling. “It was everything, but it was over so quick.”  
  
  Wes chuckled at this, and I realized too late what I had said. “I’ll work on that.”  
  
  “Want my help?” I asked, nuzzling against his collarbone.  
  
  “We have three weeks,” he pointed out.  
  
  “Brings a whole new meaning to the twelve days of Christmas.”  
  
  Wes grinned and threaded his hand through mine. “Best present ever.”  
  
  I couldn’t help but agree as we lay in the dark under a silent moon. Wes bent to brush his lips softly against mine. “I’ve been looking up at that moon and dreaming of you, Jacqueline Kelly.”  
  
  “It took you long enough to tell me,” I said, nipping his chin with my teeth playfully.  
  
  “Different cities, different lives,” he reminded me in a soft voice.  
  
  I squeezed his hand tightly, knowing he was right, but knowing there was so much more to us than geographic coordinates. “Same moon.",1,1756664341.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I (31M) have been with my wife (31F) since we were 18. We met in our first year of uni, slept together once, and from that point on we were “together.” We had some big differences — I loved partying, staying out late, experimenting with things I probably shouldn’t have, while she’s always been very calm and sensible — but we shared values, hobbies, and made it work.

After graduation, we moved in together, saved up, and eventually bought a small flat. I work in consulting, often traveling, and she works in finance. We’ve had arguments about money (she sometimes spends more than I’m comfortable with), and she hates how often I go out, but overall things seemed stable.

Then came a colleague I worked with on a big project — smart, fun, outgoing — and we got very close. Feelings developed but nothing happened. Eventually we stopped talking as much and things went back to normal.

About a year later, I was assigned a mentee — she was 21, bright, ambitious, gorgeous, and we hit it off. Over time we became very close, talking about everything — work, life, relationships. When she broke up with her boyfriend, I was there for her. We started spending more time together outside work: dinners, drinks, late-night chats. We almost kissed a few times.

Then on a work trip, after a long night out, we finally kissed. The next night we kissed again, and the night after that we slept together. I cried afterwards.

At this point, my wife and I had been married for a few months.

The affair went on for over a year. We texted constantly, went for dinners twice a week, late-night coffees, weekends together. It felt like a relationship, but in secret. She eventually left the company because she couldn’t handle the situation, but we kept seeing each other.

Eventually I told my wife everything (this was 2 years ago). She was devastated but decided to try and make it work. I ended things with my affair partner by text — cowardly, I know — and we’ve never spoken since. I later heard she was devastated, and I still feel guilty about how I handled it.

My wife and I doubled down — new city, new house, fresh start. Very quickly she got pregnant, and now we have a baby.

And I am miserable.

Our intimacy is basically gone, we’re constantly tired, we fight a lot, and I feel trapped. I keep telling myself staying is the “right” thing to do — for my wife, for our child, for my family who don’t believe in divorce — but I feel like I’m drowning.

I still feel guilty for hurting my wife and guilty for breaking my affair partner’s heart, but also resentful that this is the life I’ve ended up with.

How do I stay and not feel like I’m just punishing myself forever? How do I become a good husband and father when I feel so empty inside?",0,1756664206.0,survivinginfidelity,24,0.3,False
1n51v1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/XXRunning/comments/1n51v1p/no_recovery/,No recovery,"I need some advice. I did a long run of 8 miles this morning. I'm training for a half marathon and have already done a few runs longer than this.

  
I finished my run about 7 hours. I ran fasted (just water and coffee beforehand) but I drank 16oz of water during the run. When I got home I showered, had some more coffee, and had some breakfast. This has been the same during all my runs (I've never eaten befofe/during a long run, I know i should start but it's hard to have an appetite so early) but I've never felt as bad after as I do today.

  
I left after eating breakfast to hang out with my boyfriend and when I came home after a couple of hours basically turned into a bottomless pit and feel just incredibly weak, nauseous, and fatigued. It's midday and I had another heavy and balanced meals (both meals that I had so far were 40g protein and 600-700 calories).  Then I still felt weak so I had a Gatorade. Was still feeling it so I had a caffeinated protein shake. Still feeling it so I had a ton of water.

  
I've consumed enough that in the past hour that I've had over 1000 calories, over 75g protein, at least half a gallon of liquid, my scale weight has gone up 5 lbs and yet I still feel like I could pass out any second.

  
Not only that, but my resting heart rate is 10 higher than what it usually is. The lowest my heart rate has hit all day is 62, when usually my low is in the 40s and rhr is mid 50s. Today rhr is 67.

To any of my family members. They’re heterodox (RC) but strong believers. Friends in and out of the church.

I don’t want to be this way but I stopped doing my morning and evening prayers long ago.

I’m doing therapy with a professional that goes to my church. Hopefully I can withhold this info from him.

Depression, rejection, anxiety and struggling to heal from trauma has made me stop. I don’t want to blame God or etc. The pain of grieving the life I missed out on and how it affects me today. I just feel numb and can’t smile. 

I won’t remove my icons, discard my prayer books and etc. No point in being militant atheist, that’s cringe. 

I hope I come to my senses and repent. I just can’t any longer.

✨ THE “MY CLOSET IS FULLER THAN MY SOCIAL CALENDAR” SALE ✨

Alright, darlings, while some are price gauging rehomes due to tariffs, I’m here to offload (all but one bag) for less than I paid because *ethics*. Actually, it’s more out of desperation - my husband is over the clutter and I’ve promised to only have as many bags as will fit in the closet (e.g., none on the floor). My closet has officially thrown in the towel (or the twilly, if we’re being fancy). I’ve run out of space, and my husband has said stuff like, “why did we have this closet built if you’re just going to have bags laying around?” Excuse me, sir, these are not just “bags”, these are my babies. So, it’s time for these beauties to find new homes, preferably ones with understanding husbands and better organizational skills than yours truly.

Let’s get down to business *c’est parti*!

### **👜 THE LINEUP (BECAUSE EVEN BAGS NEED DRAMA):**

**1️⃣ Hermès Constance to Go (Yellow, Togo Leather - Mid Tier)**  
- **Seller:** Mia  
- **Comes with:** Strap (so you can wear it cross-body like the busy, important person you are)  
- **What I paid:** $168  
- **Asking:** **$150 + 🚢**  
- **Reason it’s here:** I bought 4 in different colors. I thought yellow was my color. Turns out my color is *noir*. And regret. Mainly regretting I have to rehome 🤨 

**2️⃣ Hermès Mini Bolide (New Bleu Jean, Togo Leather - Mid Tier)**  
- **Seller:** Mia  
- **Comes with:** Twilly (for when you want to feel extra) missing cross body strap but I’ll dig through my closet again and triple check. Price reduced. 
- **What I paid:** $195  
- **Asking:** **$150 + 🚢**  
- **Reason it’s here:** It’s cute. It’s blue. It’s also the 18th blue bag I own. Help.

**3️⃣ Hermès Constance Short Wallet (Orange, Togo Leather - Mid Tier)**  
- **Seller:** Mia  
- **What I paid:** $128  
- **Asking:** **$95 + 🚢**  
- **Reason it’s here:** I thought it would motivate me to be more organized. It did not. BNNU. Does not have chain to wear. I’ll dig around for it again. Price reduced. 

**4️⃣ Fendi Peekaboo Soft Medium (Blue - Mid Tier)**  
- **Seller:** Gigi  
- **Factory:** Unknown (a.k.a. ~mystery~ vibes)  
- **Comes with:** 3 straps/handles (because why choose one personality when you can have three?)  
- **What I paid:** $223  
- **Asking:** **$200 + 🚢**  
- **Reason it’s here:** It’s softer than my willpower. And that’s saying something. Used twice.

**5️⃣ Louis Vuitton Coussin PM (Gold - Mid Tier)**  
- **Seller:** James  
- **Factory:** Birdcage (yes, really)  
- **What I paid:** $223  
- **Asking:** **$175 + 🚢**  
- **Reason it’s here:** I thought it would make me look chill and effortless. Instead, I used it once and let it sit. I just don’t think I’m a metallics girl. 

**6️⃣ Louis Vuitton Neverfull MM (Metallic Garden Edition)**  
- **Seller:** Rehomed from Bao Bao  
- **Condition:** BNNU (Brand New, Never Used… by me or the rehomer)

- **Reason it’s here:** I already have three Neverfulls. Do I need a fourth? No. Do I want one? Yes, of course. Metallics are just not for me but I want them to be 😭 

**7️⃣ Loewe Puzzle Cloud (High Tier)**  
- **Seller:** Private  
- **What I paid:** $278  
- **Asking:** **$275 + 🚢**  
- **Reason it’s here:** It’s a work of art. Unfortunately, my closet is more “modern chaos” than “curated gallery.”

**8️⃣ Miu Miu Joie (Nappa Leather - High Tier)**  
- **Seller:** Private  
- **What I paid:** $276
- **Asking:** **$225 + 🚢**  
- **Reason it’s here:** I already have 7 Miu Miu - I don’t need 8. And let’s be honest, I have to rehome something. 

### **💥 CLEARANCE SECTION (FOR WHEN YOU’RE BOUGIE ON A BUDGET):**  
**JUST $99 + 🚢 EACH!** *(That’s less than my monthly coffee budget. And I drink a lot of coffee.)*

**1️⃣ Louis Vuitton Soft Trunk (Brown/Purple - Low/Mid Tier)**  
- **Seller:** James  
- **Factory:** Duty Free  

**2️⃣ Chanel School Memory Backpack (Large)**  
- **Flaws:** Tag and lock are a lil’ damaged (adds ~character~, right?)  

### **🎁 BONUS:**  
Every order comes with a **free gift**! (Probably something from the depths of my closet. Think: a slightly used twilly, charm, or my eternal gratitude.)

*Dust bags not guaranteed—but I’ll wrap your new baby in tissue paper like the precious burrito it is.*

**📦 SHIPPING:** All orders will ship **Tuesday late afternoon** (unless I get sidetracked by a new season of Love Is Blind. Kidding, I will ship them. Don’t message me asking if you can send me a label. That has been a not so good experience, so let’s save the both of us some time please)

### **📜 THE RULES (READ ‘EM AND WEEP… OR JUST READ ‘EM):**  
- **PAYMENT:** Zelle preferred but PPFF, Apple Pay, and Venmo available for small fee. **NO NOTES** (e.g., “for bag”), I’m not a seller, just a bag addict with a pissed off husband. 
- **SHIPPING:** US only. I don’t do international drama, I just watch them on TV.
- **NO RETURNS:** All sales final. What’s yours is yours (like my questionable taste in men).  
- **QC IS ON YOU:** You’re a big kid. You know what you’re doing (If not, you live and learn, boo boo).

**💌 DM TO CLAIM!** (First to pay gets the goodies. No holds, no ghosts—I’ve got enough clutter already.)

**P.S.** I have to thin the collection by 10 more bags. Follow me for another rehome in a few weeks.
