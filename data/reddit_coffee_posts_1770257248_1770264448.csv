1qwax4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1qwax4d/its_a_dog_today/,It's A Dog Today.,"1.  **Morning.**



""It's a dog today.” Judith Wench’s grating voice reported the current state of *it* over the phone before the receiver had even touched Edie Vonavich’s ear.

“Good morning, Judith,” Edie sighed. She was careful to keep her voice low so as not to wake Jefferey.

“Morning.” Judith sounded distracted. Edie could picture her now: glowering disapprovingly over the prim and proper lawns of Hawthorne Street, peeking through the blinds above her crystalline pink kitchen sink, and minding everybody’s business but her own. 

“Didn’t you hear what I just said?” Judith sniffed. 



Edie stifled another sigh; the shrill little woman’s voice reminded her of the high notes on an untuned piano. She removed the hard-boiling percolator from the stove, pouring a steaming black stream of coffee into a speckled green mug that matched her lime kitchen.



“I heard you,” Edie replied, taking a sip of coffee and savoring how it scalded her tongue. She looked out of her own window, toward the corner. She couldn’t see *it* from here, of course. Judith’s house was in the way. Still, the presence of the thing was palpable. She knew it was right over there, just out of sight, and Edie had a feeling it was aware of her as well. Despite the luridly hot coffee, Edie shuddered and snapped her blinds closed. “It’s a dog today. So what?”

“What do you mean so what?” Judith asked.

“I *mean* that it’s usually a dog.”

“Yeah? Well other times, it’s a greasy-looking teenager loitering on the corner, or a newsstand with nonsense headlines!”



Edie pinched her brow, trying to keep her voice measured; she could feel a migraine coming on. “Yes, sometimes it is,” she said, “so what?”

“You’ve got some nerve Edie Vonovich! How are you and Jeff not bothered by this?” 

“Of course, we’re bothered by it, Judith,” Edie said exasperatedly, “but it’s been sitting there for a year now, and it hasn’t hurt anybody. We all agreed at the last HOA meeting to just leave it be and let it run its course.”

“I was *stonewalled* out of that meeting and you know it!” Judith snapped. Edie heard a sharp slap over the line as Judith slammed her bony little hand down on her pink granite countertop.

“Well you were making a scene, Judith,” Edie replied.

“Only because I care about our neighbors, unlike *some* people apparently,”  Judith screeched. Edie ignored the jab, and after a moment of tense silence, Judith sniffed haughtily.

 *I’ll bet she’s got great big crocodile tears in her eyes right now,* Edie thought.



“What if it's some kind of weapon from the Soviets, hmm?” Judith continued.

Edie bit down on a derisive chuckle. “On Hawthorne Street? I doubt it, Judith.”

“Well, it’s something, Edie! And I’m gonna do something about it.”

“Oh, why don’t you just–” Edie began, but Judith slammed the phone down hard, cutting off Edie’s protest and leaving her ear ringing.

“Goodbye, Judith,” Edie said to the cut connection, hanging up herself. Jefferey would be waking up soon. He’d be cranky if breakfast wasn’t on the table. 



Even after a tantrum, Judith always called back; Edie was the only one left on Hawthorne Street who’d still put up with her, after all. Today though, the phone didn’t trill again. After she’d carefully packed Jefferey’s lunch and sent him off to work, Edie tried calling herself. She hung up after a dozen rings. Perhaps Judith was actually upset with her this time. Wearily, she supposed she might have to go over there and apologize. 



Jefferey had indeed been cranky this morning, despite his favorite breakfast— a bacon sandwich on rye with one runny egg in the center. He was simply unavoidable some days. Edie checked her concealer carefully in the mirror by the door. She’d gotten quite good at hiding the marks, and the swelling had been skillfully subdued by icing in just the right places, but the broken blood vessels in her left eye were still visible. She slipped on a pair of pert little shades; it was supposed to storm later, but as of now, the day was sunshiney and clear. She’d use the early summer weather as an excuse to lure Judith outside so she wouldn’t have to take the glasses off.



The sun felt good on Edie’s skin as she stepped outside. A cool breeze caressed her as it rolled by, carrying the scent of lavender and laundry, and Edie inhaled it deeply. The fresh air slowed the anxiety that thrummed in her blood as she took off.



She didn’t like walking near *it*. Most days, she avoided this end of Hawthorne Street altogether. That thing was on the opposite corner from the Wench house, in front of a vacant lot the neighborhood kids had used to play in before *it* had appeared. Where the thing had come from, nobody really knew, nor could anyone remember exactly when *it* had first begun squatting on the corner. One day, *it* was just there. Edie’s view of the thing from her yard was obscured by the profile of Judith’s house, several yards from her own home and across the street. She was thankful for that. Judith’s front door faced the thing’s corner. She could see *it* from her kitchen window. Maybe that was why she was so obsessed with *it*. On days when Edie didn’t have to go in this particular direction though, she could almost forget that the thing was there. Almost*.* 



Edie walked the three-house distance between her own abode and Judith’s, crossing the street and moving quickly. She kept her eyes down as she rounded the corner of the Wench house, branching off from the sidewalk to their paved walkway. Edie could feel *it* staring at her from across the street– if the thing *could* stare. She was fairly certain *it* could. Worse than that, she could *hear* the thing.



The closer one came to *it*, the louder the incessant, ringing hum that seemed to come from the thing became. It was high-pitched, on the edge of human hearing, and decidedly unpleasant. It forced the brain to search out the source, convinced that danger was afoot. Edie plugged her ears as she approached Judith’s front door, trying to block it out. As she neared the porch, she couldn’t help but cast a backward glance at the thing on the corner.



Judith had been right; *it* was a dog today. At least, *it* was if you didn’t look too closely. The thing was more like the vague idea of a dog. The longer one looked, the more one realized that *it* was only pretending. As she stared, Edie could feel the anxiety begin to race toward her heart once more. She turned and quickly stepped onto the Wench porch. She knocked urgently, trying to ignore the feeling that the thing was specifically watching her. As her flurry of knocks began to quicken, Sean Wench answered the door mid-pummeling, nearly receiving a tiny fist to the chest for his trouble.



“Oh, hi there Edie, what can I do for you?” he asked. He wore a torn-up t-shirt and grimy jeans. His hands were greasy, and as he spoke he wiped them off with an equally greasy rag. His smile was friendly, but his uneasy eyes flickered back and forth from Edie to the ‘dog’ on the corner as he spoke.



“Hi Sean, sorry to bother you,” Edie said, plastering a fake smile onto her face. “I called a moment ago.” She did her best to discreetly peer past the square-framed, ginger man and into the house but failed to see much at all past the shadowy landing.

“Sorry about that,” Sean said, stuffing the rag in his pocket and leaning on the doorframe, “I was out in the garage doing an oil change on the Mercury.”

“I see. Judith home?”

Sean’s eyes fell to his feet. “No, she's… at the store. Getting supplies.”

“Supplies for what?”

Sean looked uncomfortable. “She’s gonna make signs. To boycott that… thing over there.”

Edie’s jaw dropped. “W-what?” 

Sean sighed. “Yeah,” he continued, “She’s… protesting it.”

“Oh for the love of Pete.” Edie rolled her eyes and crossed her thin arms tightly.

“I told her to just leave it be,” Sean said, shrugging and shaking his head. “Judith always was an independent one.”



Edie scoffed.“ She is going to look just like one of those dirty hippies on the news,” she said, turning away and descending the porch steps. In her fervor, she momentarily forgot *its* presence. As she walked crisply down the sidewalk toward home, she continued to grumble. “Wait until that silly little woman gets back,” she mumbled under her breath, “I’ll talk some sense into her.”



1. **Noon.**



Jefferey called on his lunch break, as he always did, to inform Edie he would be going to the bar after work and would be late, as he always was.

“Jefferey, Judith Wench is out protesting *it*,” Edie told her husband.

“Protesting what?” Jefferey’s bored voice was muffled by a bite of the lunch Edie had packed him.

“*It*.”

“Oh. This sandwich you packed is dry as hell.”

“I used extra mustard like you asked—“

“That’s two strikes counting breakfast, Edie. Dinner best be something else, or I swear to God.”

His sentence needed no final point. Edie knew what a bland dinner would entail, and whenever Jeff swore to God, he meant it. He was a Christian man, after all. 



“It’s meatloaf tonight. Like you asked. I’ll make sure it’s not dry, I’ll… I’ll use fewer breadcrumbs–”

“Use extra barbecue sauce on it too. The last time you made it I thought I was eating packed sand. Just don’t make it dry. Anyway, I gotta go.”

 “Jeff,” Edie said meekly, coiling the phone cord around one finger, “Did you hear what I said about Judith?”

“Yeah? Who cares?”

“What if she provokes *it*?”

“Maybe it’ll eat her.” He chuckled cruelly at his little joke, “Wouldn’t that be just fine?”

“Jeff, I don’t think it’s a good idea for her to be out there.”

“Leave it *be*, Edie.” His words had a venomous bite, and Edie’s protest coagulated in her throat.

“Yes, Dear. I’m sorry.”



The line was silent for a moment, except for Jefferey’s greedy smacks as he downed another bite of his dry sandwich.

“Damn Judith, getting you all riled up,” he mumbled through crumbs, “That Sean needs to get a handle on his woman. Maybe I’ll have a word with them. After work.”



Edie forced a tight smile onto her face and hoped it would translate well over the phone. “That would be nice, Jeff,” Edie said, “I love–”

But Jefferey had hung up. 



1.  **Afternoon.**



Jefferey had said to leave it alone, and Edie tried. She cleaned the house thoroughly, prepped the ground beef for that night’s meatloaf, and ran a load of laundry, making sure to do Jefferey’s whites separately so that she didn’t accidentally stain them again. She had let a red sock get by her the week before. Jeff had wrenched it from her hand so hard that her wrist was still fairly swollen. Although she hid it well with her mother’s gold cuff, Edie didn’t feel the need to repeat the scenario with the other wrist. She was hanging the clothes out to dry when the chanting drifted down to her from the direction of the Wench house and the thing on the corner. It was offkey and haranguing, definitely Judith.  Hanging the last of the sheets, Edie couldn’t help but traipse up the street to see how much of a commotion she was truly going to make.



The thin little wretch was out on the street, standing next to *it*, goose-stepping in place and throwing together badly rhymed shouts of protest. Neighbors were peeking out of their windows, and a brave few even opened their doors to observe a moment before shutting them again. 



“Judith, what are you doing out here?” Edie whisper-shouted as she approached. The last thing she needed was to draw attention to herself. If one of the neighbors let slip to Jefferey that she had been out making a fuss about Judith’s fuss, after he had told her to leave it be, well… that was best to be avoided.



In Judith’s grippers was a hand-painted sign emblazoned with the words “Make Hawthorne Street Normal Again!” in thick black paint.  At Edie’s voice,  Judith turned, her pale blue eyes glowing with determination behind coke-bottle glasses. 

“I am picketing here until the city gets involved,” she cried.

“The city did get involved, Judith,” Edie said, throwing her hands in the air, “They even brought a crane in, remember? They couldn’t budge the darn thing!”

Judith didn’t miss a beat. “So now we’ll get the county involved!”

“What’s the county going to do? Bring in a bigger crane?”

“They could call somebody!”

Edie planted her hands on her hips. “Yeah? Who?’

“I don’t know! The President? The Army? Somebody who could get rid of this thing!”

“Hell’s Bells, Judith, it’s just a dog!” Edie could hear herself getting louder. The realization began to lightly fry her nerves and only loosened the control she had over her voice even more.



Judith threw her sign to the ground now. “It’s not just a dog, Edie,” she said, pointing in the thing’s direction. As she did so, the ringing that emanated from *it* changed pitch, as if it had taken notice of somebody acknowledging it. Judith didn’t seem to notice.

“Look at that thing and tell me it's a dog,” Judith shouted.



Slowly, the muscles in her neck creaking like rusted machinery, Edie forced her gaze over to *it*. The thing stared back at her with both too many and too few eyes, watching her intently. Edie could have sworn its head cocked at her curiously. She was suddenly acutely aware that though she had mixed the beef for dinner over an hour ago, this *thing* might still be able to smell the scent of raw meat on her. Edie turned back to Judith.



“It looks enough like a dog that I can ignore it,” she said.

“And what about tomorrow?” Judith stomped her foot. “What if tomorrow it’s a… a… a homeless man raving in another language? Or some kind of bomb set to destroy us all, hmm? What if it turns into something that you *can’t* ignore, Edie?”

“Judith, you’re being foolish. Go inside!”

“I am not leaving this spot until something is done about this! Someone has got to hold the line around here, and I guess it’s me!”

With that, she picked up her sign once more and continued to chant and holler. 



“Fine!” Edie said, turning on her heel, “I’ve got a meatloaf to make anyway!”

As she walked away, she did not notice the humming of the thing change register one more time. *It* almost seemed to squeal, like the squelch of radio static. Too low to be heard over Judith’s chanting, something almost like a word seemed to slip from the hum.



*“Meatloaf.”*

  


1. **Evening.**



Suppertime came and went without Jefferey pulling into the driveway. As the purple summer dusk gradually drained from the darkening sky, Edie delicately wrapped a plate of meatloaf and mixed veggies in cling wrap. She placed it in the fridge on the second shelf. On a miniature yellow legal pad, she carefully wrote a note to Jefferey, telling him his dinner was in the fridge and that if he microwaved it with a paper towel on it, it wouldn’t be dry. She stuck this note to the fridge door with a magnet. God, she hoped he’d read it. 



The clouds had begun to gather over Hawthorne Street, throwing an ever-blackening blanket over the stars. Edie had opened the bedroom window before lying down to try and stir the stagnant, stuffy air of the house, but the hot breeze that blew in was thick and humid, making sweat spring from her pores whilst carrying the heavy scent of the impending summer rain. Thunder began to rumble faintly in the dark heart of the gathering storm poised above. Still, if she lay quietly and strained her ears, Edie could just hear the faded chants of Judith Wench as she marched on in solitary protest down the street. She secretly smiled, tickled at the thought of the little busybody getting soaked in the imminent downpour. Hopefully, she’d still be awake when the storm broke and let loose. She wouldn’t be able to see Judith from her window, but surely she would hear her screeches of distress.



1. **Night.**



At some point, Edie fell asleep to the thought of her nosy neighbor ending up waterlogged. She rarely dreamt anymore, but when the sudden, brilliant flash of white light shocked her from the dark recesses of sleep, she thought for a moment that she might be in one. Lightning that close always made a sound after all, and the strobing, sterile flashes that pulsated periodically along her walls were entirely silent. Gradually, though, the chill of the room touched her bones, and she realized that she was no longer asleep.



The storm had broken the heat of the day, pushing it out of the house through the open window on the other side of the room. The breeze had sharpened into a cutting wind, sending the curtains flailing. The smell of the furious rain that beat against the house was metallic in Edie’s nostrils. She felt toward the other side of the bed with her hand and found it empty. Jefferey wasn’t home yet.



Edie lifted herself out of bed, traipsing carefully across the room so as not to stub her toe. As she reached the window and began to slide it shut, another silent flash erupted. This one seemed brighter than the others, illuminating the entire room and momentarily blinding Edie’s tired eyes. She rubbed at them, forgetting the blackened one that Jefferey had given her and wincing in pain as she touched the delicate, purple skin. When sight returned, she finished shutting the window before peering out of it and into the storm. The lightning had seemed lower than it should, as though it had come from street level. A moment later, a peal of thunder erupted, loud enough to be heard through the double panes. Instead of a low roar though, it was high-pitched and shrill. Edie’s tired mind took a beat of calculation before realizing that what she was hearing was a scream. After another beat, it hit her just who that scream belonged to: Judith.



Not bothering with clothes or shoes, Edie burst from her front door barefoot into the pouring rain with only her nightie. The downpour was a spattering cacophony, but behind it, she could hear something else: a constant, humming whine, as though high-pitched radio static had been sharpened into a spear. Monotonous and unrelenting, it stabbed at the eardrums and dimmed the sound of the rain. Ignoring it, Edie beelined toward the Wench house. Another flash erupted on just the other side of it– from the corner where *it* was. This time, the light did not fade, though. It remained on, blindingly bright. The street lights of Hawthorne Street all turned off at once, convinced that the day had come early. Edie hustled on, her lime-painted toes slapping wet pavement. 



As Edie came upon the corner proper, the incessant whine grew louder. She shielded her eyes as she came upon the heart of the brilliant white light, so encompassing that it made it impossible to move any closer to it. Something in her nose popped, and a hot trickle of blood erupted down her face. Desperately trying to peer into the engulfing whiteness, she thought that she could just make out three silhouettes– two human, and one so entirely vague yet defined that it defied description. She tried to scream and found that the sound was taken by the ringing. Compressing her eyes to slits and shielding her face, Edie watched as the vague silhouette moved toward the humans. It appeared to reach for one, extending itself in an ever quickening motion.



“Judith!” Edie mouthed in horror, the words muted by the tinnitus-like ring.

“*Meatloaf*.” 



The reply seemed to come from both the center of the light and from within Edie’s own mind. Before she could fully comprehend this reply, the light receded into a pinpoint on the corner where *it* had been for a microsecond, plunging the tangible world into rain-filled darkness. Then, it silently exploded. The blast put Edie on her back, soaking her through whilst bleaching Hawthorne Street featureless. White nothing enveloped everything. As the world dematerialized around her, Edie closed her eyes and waited for reality to end.



Minutes ticked by like hours. Gradually, Edie realized that the whining ring had dissipated, leaving only the pattering rain. A few more minutes passed, picking up the pace now, and finally, Edie dared a peek. Prying her eyes open, she found herself lying half-submerged in an ever-deepening puddle. The night was black again.. A shiver erupted violently from the middle of her spine, and Edie shakily picked herself up just as the streetlights began to tick back on, one by one. Edie wiped a hand down her face and looked at it. The blood from her nose had been thinned by the rain, smearing her hand pink. She tried to step from the puddle and stumbled. The arms of a neighbor caught her; she realized then that a crowd had gathered. 



Where *it* had once perched on the corner, there was now only a charred mark on the sidewalk. Sean Wench was gathering up Judith, who lay in a crumpled heap beside it. She was wailing, high-pitched and dreadful like a banshee, clutching her protest sign desperately to her chest as her husband led her away through the silently parting crowd toward their house. Something else was on the corner, too– something familiar. Crookedly against the curb, the driver’s door hanging open, was Jefferey’s Chrysler. Its engine was silent, but the headlights were on, lancing through the darkness and the rain.



*I’ll have a word with them*. Jefferey’s voice echoed in Edie’s mind. Silently, peering through a soaked rat's nest of hair in front of her eyes, she scanned the corner for any sign of her husband. There was none except for the car. 



Without a word, Edie shook off the hands of the neighbor who’d caught her. He said something as she walked away, but it was lost on the wind. Edie approached the car and slumped into the driver’s seat. The keys were still in the ignition, and when she turned them, it started right away, the engine still warm. The growl of the engine seemed to snap everybody back to reality, and the crowd began to disperse as Edie shut the car’s door, put it in gear, and slowly rolled down the street to her own house. She parked in the driveway and went inside.



As the door shut behind her, she became viscerally aware of the humming whine; bladed tinnitus. A flickering white light emanated from the living room, and as Edie approached, she could feel the warm dribble as her nose began to bleed again. Yet, there was no dread like before. 



She rounded the corner to the den, delicately clutching the molding of the doorway as she peered in. Crouched in his easy chair and finishing up the meatloaf she’d left on a plate in the fridge, was Jefferey. At least, it was if you didn’t look too closely.



“The meatloaf was delicious, darling,” ‘Jefferey’ said. His voice sounded like TV snow bent into words.

*Jefferey doesn’t like my meatloaf,* Edie thought.

“It wasn’t too dry?” Edie’s voice squeaked from her throat, just above a whisper.

‘Jefferey’s’ lips(?) curled into something like a facsimile of a smile. “*Moist*.""

After a moment, Edie smiled back. “Welcome home, Dear.”



It was the first time in recent memory that she’d meant those words.

1qwatic,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1qwatic/why_did_you_quit_the_coffee_shop/,Why did you quit the coffee shop?,"Hello! I would like to talk about my experience at my previous job (a small coffee shop from a fairly popular coffee chain in Korea), and I would be interested to know about your experience.
I write through Google Translate, so there may be errors. I'm sorry  ( ´-｀)

I worked part-time at that coffee shop for almost eight months and loved working there(mainly thanks to other baristas I've made friends with and my regular customers). The room was small and cramped enough that only two girls could work there at a time. My friend and I still got tight when we worked (162-165 cm tall and slim physique). The coffee shop was near the subway, so there were always a lot of customers.
My relationship with the coffee shop owner wasn't bad, but definitely not the person I wanted to be friends with. I'm still grateful she didn't fire me when I had to have emergency knee surgery, even though I had only been working for a few weeks at that time and was supposed to be away for about a month, after the surgery. But as an employee and owner of the establishment, she was average, not even too responsible. She often didn't keep the usual cleanliness, starting the shift after it was frustrating as she had to clean up the workspace and have time to serve customers. + a lot of insects flew in through the service window and I had to be a knight for customers' drinks too. This was annoying but bearable, unlike talking to her and interacting with her children. She was a ""psychologist"" who unlearned online and got some kind of certificate. You should have heard that nonsense. I swear, I'm not a conflict person, but I wanted to smash her face for suggesting about my family by doing her ""psychoanalysis"" about me. And her children were uncontrollable. I told you the room is cramped, what's cramped even for petite people? Now imagine if more kids got in there. Her daughter (13 years old) was still tolerant, although she often watched YouTube videos at full volume, but after a few remarks, she turned the sound down. And her son (6 years old) was unbearable. He very often reached into the ice with his hands, wrote a couple of times in disposable cups and poured his urine into the sink, a couple of times reached into customers' drinks with his fingers (which forced me to redesign the drink), talked to me as if I were his servant. Why am I talking about her kids?
This woman is a single mother. I respect single parents who raise their kids and get through the work, but it was unbearable. In fact, she dumped her kids on the workers and left. She didn't ask or ask to babysit her kids, just brought them to the coffee shop and left. Often, the role of the nanny went to me. I needed money since I didn't want to sit on my parents' neck and wanted to help them pay the loan, so I took on a bunch of extra shifts. She paid a minimum ($6.85 per hour, at 2024-2025 year), and I had to endure it all. In doing so, I was actually doing the duties of a barista and, as it turned out, also a manager. It all came down to the fact that I had about six twelve-hour shifts a month and worked six days a week. It wasn't until after I was fired that I realized that it was illegal since I was a part-time employee under the contract.
With all that said, I was exhausted on my last day at work and my patience was running out. She left her kids at the coffee shop once again, and when she came back for them, I told her once again that it was hard for me to look after her kids and serve customers at the same time, and she started arguing with me. Can you imagine? She started telling me that I didn't have to look after her kids and they looked after themselves. For me, if a child is left near me, then it's my responsibility to keep an eye on them to make sure they're safe and not kidnapped (there have been a few cases of children trying to be stolen in that area). As annoyed as her kids might have me, I didn't want anything to happen to them. What mother can leave her children like this, justifying it by saying that they are independent and can look after themselves? And honestly, my logic is that if something happened to the kids, they'd start blaming me because I was an adult next to them.
In the end, I quit on the spot and left in the middle of my shift as she wouldn't listen to me at all and kept screaming. Honestly, I burst into tears while driving home. I think that was the last straw for me.
I work at another coffee shop now. Still as a part-time worker, but I love it here and am already being prepared for full-time work since I'm about to be hired as an official worker. +I'll get four basic insurances that weren't available for official workers at the previous coffee shop. That coffee shop is still open, but the reviews there are terrible, so it's probably headed for closure. ",1,1770263753.0,barista,0,1.0,False

1.  **Morning.**



""It's a dog today.” Judith Wench’s grating voice reported the current state of *it* over the phone before the receiver had even touched Edie Vonavich’s ear.

“Good morning, Judith,” Edie sighed. She was careful to keep her voice low so as not to wake Jefferey.

“Morning.” Judith sounded distracted. Edie could picture her now: glowering disapprovingly over the prim and proper lawns of Hawthorne Street, peeking through the blinds above her crystalline pink kitchen sink, and minding everybody’s business but her own. 

“Didn’t you hear what I just said?” Judith sniffed. 

Edie stifled another sigh; the shrill little woman’s voice reminded her of the high notes on an untuned piano. She removed the hard-boiling percolator from the stove, pouring a steaming black stream of coffee into a speckled green mug that matched her lime kitchen.

“I heard you,” Edie replied, taking a sip of coffee and savoring how it scalded her tongue. She looked out of her own window, toward the corner. She couldn’t see *it* from here, of course. Judith’s house was in the way. Still, the presence of the thing was palpable. She knew it was right over there, just out of sight, and Edie had a feeling it was aware of her as well. Despite the luridly hot coffee, Edie shuddered and snapped her blinds closed. “It’s a dog today. So what?”

“What do you mean so what?” Judith asked.

“I *mean* that it’s usually a dog.”

“Yeah? Well other times, it’s a greasy-looking teenager loitering on the corner, or a newsstand with nonsense headlines!”

Edie pinched her brow, trying to keep her voice measured; she could feel a migraine coming on. “Yes, sometimes it is,” she said, “so what?”

“You’ve got some nerve Edie Vonovich! How are you and Jeff not bothered by this?” 

“Of course, we’re bothered by it, Judith,” Edie said exasperatedly, “but it’s been sitting there for a year now, and it hasn’t hurt anybody. We all agreed at the last HOA meeting to just leave it be and let it run its course.”

“I was *stonewalled* out of that meeting and you know it!” Judith snapped. Edie heard a sharp slap over the line as Judith slammed her bony little hand down on her pink granite countertop.

“Well you were making a scene, Judith,” Edie replied.

“Only because I care about our neighbors, unlike *some* people apparently,”  Judith screeched. Edie ignored the jab, and after a moment of tense silence, Judith sniffed haughtily.

 *I’ll bet she’s got great big crocodile tears in her eyes right now,* Edie thought.

“What if it's some kind of weapon from the Soviets, hmm?” Judith continued.

Edie bit down on a derisive chuckle. “On Hawthorne Street? I doubt it, Judith.”

“Well, it’s something, Edie! And I’m gonna do something about it.”

“Oh, why don’t you just–” Edie began, but Judith slammed the phone down hard, cutting off Edie’s protest and leaving her ear ringing.

“Goodbye, Judith,” Edie said to the cut connection, hanging up herself. Jefferey would be waking up soon. He’d be cranky if breakfast wasn’t on the table. 

Even after a tantrum, Judith always called back; Edie was the only one left on Hawthorne Street who’d still put up with her, after all. Today though, the phone didn’t trill again. After she’d carefully packed Jefferey’s lunch and sent him off to work, Edie tried calling herself. She hung up after a dozen rings. Perhaps Judith was actually upset with her this time. Wearily, she supposed she might have to go over there and apologize. 

Jefferey had indeed been cranky this morning, despite his favorite breakfast— a bacon sandwich on rye with one runny egg in the center. He was simply unavoidable some days. Edie checked her concealer carefully in the mirror by the door. She’d gotten quite good at hiding the marks, and the swelling had been skillfully subdued by icing in just the right places, but the broken blood vessels in her left eye were still visible. She slipped on a pair of pert little shades; it was supposed to storm later, but as of now, the day was sunshiney and clear. She’d use the early summer weather as an excuse to lure Judith outside so she wouldn’t have to take the glasses off.

The sun felt good on Edie’s skin as she stepped outside. A cool breeze caressed her as it rolled by, carrying the scent of lavender and laundry, and Edie inhaled it deeply. The fresh air slowed the anxiety that thrummed in her blood as she took off.

She didn’t like walking near *it*. Most days, she avoided this end of Hawthorne Street altogether. That thing was on the opposite corner from the Wench house, in front of a vacant lot the neighborhood kids had used to play in before *it* had appeared. Where the thing had come from, nobody really knew, nor could anyone remember exactly when *it* had first begun squatting on the corner. One day, *it* was just there. Edie’s view of the thing from her yard was obscured by the profile of Judith’s house, several yards from her own home and across the street. She was thankful for that. Judith’s front door faced the thing’s corner. She could see *it* from her kitchen window. Maybe that was why she was so obsessed with *it*. On days when Edie didn’t have to go in this particular direction though, she could almost forget that the thing was there. Almost*.* 

Edie walked the three-house distance between her own abode and Judith’s, crossing the street and moving quickly. She kept her eyes down as she rounded the corner of the Wench house, branching off from the sidewalk to their paved walkway. Edie could feel *it* staring at her from across the street– if the thing *could* stare. She was fairly certain *it* could. Worse than that, she could *hear* the thing.

The closer one came to *it*, the louder the incessant, ringing hum that seemed to come from the thing became. It was high-pitched, on the edge of human hearing, and decidedly unpleasant. It forced the brain to search out the source, convinced that danger was afoot. Edie plugged her ears as she approached Judith’s front door, trying to block it out. As she neared the porch, she couldn’t help but cast a backward glance at the thing on the corner.

 Judith had been right; *it* was a dog today. At least, *it* was if you didn’t look too closely. The thing was more like the vague idea of a dog. The longer one looked, the more one realized that *it* was only pretending. As she stared, Edie could feel the anxiety begin to race toward her heart once more. She turned and quickly stepped onto the Wench porch. She knocked urgently, trying to ignore the feeling that the thing was specifically watching her. As her flurry of knocks began to quicken, Sean Wench answered the door mid-pummeling, nearly receiving a tiny fist to the chest for his trouble.

“Oh, hi there Edie, what can I do for you?” he asked. He wore a torn-up t-shirt and grimy jeans. His hands were greasy, and as he spoke he wiped them off with an equally greasy rag. His smile was friendly, but his uneasy eyes flickered back and forth from Edie to the ‘dog’ on the corner as he spoke.

“Hi Sean, sorry to bother you,” Edie said, plastering a fake smile onto her face. “I called a moment ago.” She did her best to discreetly peer past the square-framed, ginger man and into the house but failed to see much at all past the shadowy landing.

“Sorry about that,” Sean said, stuffing the rag in his pocket and leaning on the doorframe, “I was out in the garage doing an oil change on the Mercury.”

“I see. Judith home?”

Sean’s eyes fell to his feet. “No, she's… at the store. Getting supplies.”

“Supplies for what?”

Sean looked uncomfortable. “She’s gonna make signs. To boycott that… thing over there.”

Edie’s jaw dropped. “W-what?” 

Sean sighed. “Yeah,” he continued, “She’s… protesting it.”

“Oh for the love of Pete.” Edie rolled her eyes and crossed her thin arms tightly.

“I told her to just leave it be,” Sean said, shrugging and shaking his head. “Judith always was an independent one.”

Edie scoffed.“She is going to look just like one of those dirty hippies on the news,” she said, turning away and descending the porch steps. In her fervor, she momentarily forgot *its* presence. As she walked crisply down the sidewalk toward home, she continued to grumble. “Wait until that silly little woman gets back,” she mumbled under her breath, “I’ll talk some sense into her.”



1. **Noon.**



Jefferey called on his lunch break, as he always did, to inform Edie he would be going to the bar after work and would be late, as he always was.

“Jefferey, Judith Wench is out protesting *it*,” Edie told her husband.

“Protesting what?” Jefferey’s bored voice was muffled by a bite of the lunch Edie had packed him.

“*It*.”

“Oh. This sandwich you packed is dry as hell.”

“I used extra mustard like you asked—“

“That’s two strikes counting breakfast, Edie. Dinner best be something else, or I swear to God.”

His sentence needed no final point. Edie knew what a bland dinner would entail, and whenever Jeff swore to God, he meant it. He was a Christian man, after all. 

“It’s meatloaf tonight. Like you asked. I’ll make sure it’s not dry, I’ll… I’ll use fewer breadcrumbs–”

“Use extra barbecue sauce on it too. The last time you made it I thought I was eating packed sand. Just don’t make it dry. Anyway, I gotta go.”

 “Jeff,” Edie said meekly, coiling the phone cord around one finger, “Did you hear what I said about Judith?”

“Yeah? Who cares?”

“What if she provokes *it*?”

“Maybe it’ll eat her.” He chuckled cruelly at his little joke, “Wouldn’t that be just fine?”

“Jeff, I don’t think it’s a good idea for her to be out there.”

“Leave it *be*, Edie.” His words had a venomous bite, and Edie’s protest coagulated in her throat.

“Yes, Dear. I’m sorry.”

The line was silent for a moment, except for Jefferey’s greedy smacks as he downed another bite of his dry sandwich.

“Damn Judith, getting you all riled up,” he mumbled through crumbs, “That Sean needs to get a handle on his woman. Maybe I’ll have a word with them. After work.”

Edie forced a tight smile onto her face and hoped it would translate well over the phone. “That would be nice, Jeff,” Edie said, “I love–”

But Jefferey had hung up. 



1.  **Afternoon.**



Jefferey had said to leave it alone, and Edie tried. She cleaned the house thoroughly, prepped the ground beef for that night’s meatloaf, and ran a load of laundry, making sure to do Jefferey’s whites separately so that she didn’t accidentally stain them again. She had let a red sock get by her the week before. Jeff had wrenched it from her hand so hard that her wrist was still fairly swollen. Although she hid it well with her mother’s gold cuff, Edie didn’t feel the need to repeat the scenario with the other wrist. She was hanging the clothes out to dry when the chanting drifted down to her from the direction of the Wench house and the thing on the corner. It was offkey and haranguing, definitely Judith.  Hanging the last of the sheets, Edie couldn’t help but traipse up the street to see how much of a commotion she was truly going to make.

 The thin little wretch was out on the street, standing next to *it*, goose-stepping in place and throwing together badly rhymed shouts of protest. Neighbors were peeking out of their windows, and a brave few even opened their doors to observe a moment before shutting them again. 

“Judith, what are you doing out here?” Edie whisper-shouted as she approached. The last thing she needed was to draw attention to herself. If one of the neighbors let slip to Jefferey that she had been out making a fuss about Judith’s fuss, after he had told her to leave it be, well… that was best to be avoided.

 In Judith’s grippers was a hand-painted sign emblazoned with the words “Make Hawthorne Street Normal Again!” in thick black paint.  At Edie’s voice,  Judith turned, her pale blue eyes glowing with determination behind coke-bottle glasses. 

“I am picketing here until the city gets involved,” she cried.

“The city did get involved, Judith,” Edie said, throwing her hands in the air, “They even brought a crane in, remember? They couldn’t budge the darn thing!”

Judith didn’t miss a beat. “So now we’ll get the county involved!”

“What’s the county going to do? Bring in a bigger crane?”

“They could call somebody!”

Edie planted her hands on her hips. “Yeah? Who?’

“I don’t know! The President? The Army? Somebody who could get rid of this thing!”

“Hell’s Bells, Judith, it’s just a dog!” Edie could hear herself getting louder. The realization began to lightly fry her nerves and only loosened the control she had over her voice even more.

Judith threw her sign to the ground now. “It’s not just a dog, Edie,” she said, pointing in the thing’s direction. As she did so, the ringing that emanated from *it* changed pitch, as if it had taken notice of somebody acknowledging it. Judith didn’t seem to notice.

 “Look at that thing and tell me it's a dog,” Judith shouted.

Slowly, the muscles in her neck creaking like rusted machinery, Edie forced her gaze over to *it*. The thing stared back at her with both too many and too few eyes, watching her intently. Edie could have sworn its head cocked at her curiously. She was suddenly acutely aware that though she had mixed the beef for dinner over an hour ago, this *thing* might still be able to smell the scent of raw meat on her. Edie turned back to Judith.

“It looks enough like a dog that I can ignore it,” she said.

“And what about tomorrow?” Judith stomped her foot. “What if tomorrow it’s a… a… a homeless man raving in another language? Or some kind of bomb set to destroy us all, hmm? What if it turns into something that you *can’t* ignore, Edie?”

“Judith, you’re being foolish. Go inside!”

“I am not leaving this spot until something is done about this! Someone has got to hold the line around here, and I guess it’s me!”

With that, she picked up her sign once more and continued to chant and holler. 

“Fine!” Edie said, turning on her heel, “I’ve got a meatloaf to make anyway!”

As she walked away, she did not notice the humming of the thing change register one more time. *It* almost seemed to squeal, like the squelch of radio static. Too low to be heard over Judith’s chanting, something almost like a word seemed to slip from the hum.

*“Meatloaf.”*

  


1. **Evening.**



Suppertime came and went without Jefferey pulling into the driveway. As the purple summer dusk gradually drained from the darkening sky, Edie delicately wrapped a plate of meatloaf and mixed veggies in cling wrap. She placed it in the fridge on the second shelf. On a miniature yellow legal pad, she carefully wrote a note to Jefferey, telling him his dinner was in the fridge and that if he microwaved it with a paper towel on it, it wouldn’t be dry. She stuck this note to the fridge door with a magnet. God, she hoped he’d read it. 

The clouds had begun to gather over Hawthorne Street, throwing an ever-blackening blanket over the stars. Edie had opened the bedroom window before lying down to try and stir the stagnant, stuffy air of the house, but the hot breeze that blew in was thick and humid, making sweat spring from her pores whilst carrying the heavy scent of the impending summer rain. Thunder began to rumble faintly in the dark heart of the gathering storm poised above. Still, if she lay quietly and strained her ears, Edie could just hear the faded chants of Judith Wench as she marched on in solitary protest down the street. She secretly smiled, tickled at the thought of the little busybody getting soaked in the imminent downpour. Hopefully, she’d still be awake when the storm broke and let loose. She wouldn’t be able to see Judith from her window, but surely she would hear her screeches of distress.



1. **Night.**



At some point, Edie fell asleep to the thought of her nosy neighbor ending up waterlogged. She rarely dreamt anymore, but when the sudden, brilliant flash of white light shocked her from the dark recesses of sleep, she thought for a moment that she might be in one. Lightning that close always made a sound after all, and the strobing, sterile flashes that pulsated periodically along her walls were entirely silent. Gradually, though, the chill of the room touched her bones, and she realized that she was no longer asleep.

The storm had broken the heat of the day, pushing it out of the house through the open window on the other side of the room. The breeze had sharpened into a cutting wind, sending the curtains flailing. The smell of the furious rain that beat against the house was metallic in Edie’s nostrils. She felt toward the other side of the bed with her hand and found it empty. Jefferey wasn’t home yet.

Edie lifted herself out of bed, traipsing carefully across the room so as not to stub her toe. As she reached the window and began to slide it shut, another silent flash erupted. This one seemed brighter than the others, illuminating the entire room and momentarily blinding Edie’s tired eyes. She rubbed at them, forgetting the blackened one that Jefferey had given her and wincing in pain as she touched the delicate, purple skin. When sight returned, she finished shutting the window before peering out of it and into the storm. The lightning had seemed lower than it should, as though it had come from street level. A moment later, a peal of thunder erupted, loud enough to be heard through the double panes. Instead of a low roar though, it was high-pitched and shrill. Edie’s tired mind took a beat of calculation before realizing that what she was hearing was a scream. After another beat, it hit her just who that scream belonged to: Judith.

Not bothering with clothes or shoes, Edie burst from her front door barefoot into the pouring rain with only her nightie. The downpour was a spattering cacophony, but behind it, she could hear something else: a constant, humming whine, as though high-pitched radio static had been sharpened into a spear. Monotonous and unrelenting, it stabbed at the eardrums and dimmed the sound of the rain. Ignoring it, Edie beelined toward the Wench house. Another flash erupted on just the other side of it– from the corner where *it* was. This time, the light did not fade, though. It remained on, blindingly bright. The street lights of Hawthorne Street all turned off at once, convinced that the day had come early. Edie hustled on, her lime-painted toes slapping wet pavement. 

As Edie came upon the corner proper, the incessant whine grew louder. She shielded her eyes as she came upon the heart of the brilliant white light, so encompassing that it made it impossible to move any closer to it. Something in her nose popped, and a hot trickle of blood erupted down her face. Desperately trying to peer into the engulfing whiteness, she thought that she could just make out three silhouettes– two human, and one so entirely vague yet defined that it defied description. She tried to scream and found that the sound was taken by the ringing. Compressing her eyes to slits and shielding her face, Edie watched as the vague silhouette moved toward the humans. It appeared to reach for one, extending itself in an ever quickening motion.

“Judith!” Edie mouthed in horror, the words muted by the tinnitus-like ring.

“*Meatloaf*.” 

The reply seemed to come from both the center of the light and from within Edie’s own mind. Before she could fully comprehend this reply, the light receded into a pinpoint on the corner where *it* had been for a microsecond, plunging the tangible world into rain-filled darkness. Then, it silently exploded. The blast put Edie on her back, soaking her through whilst bleaching Hawthorne Street featureless. White nothing enveloped everything. As the world dematerialized around her, Edie closed her eyes and waited for reality to end.

Minutes ticked by like hours. Gradually, Edie realized that the whining ring had dissipated, leaving only the pattering rain. A few more minutes passed, picking up the pace now, and finally, Edie dared a peek. Prying her eyes open, she found herself lying half-submerged in an ever-deepening puddle. The night was black again.. A shiver erupted violently from the middle of her spine, and Edie shakily picked herself up just as the streetlights began to tick back on, one by one. Edie wiped a hand down her face and looked at it. The blood from her nose had been thinned by the rain, smearing her hand pink. She tried to step from the puddle and stumbled. The arms of a neighbor caught her; she realized then that a crowd had gathered. 

Where *it* had once perched on the corner, there was now only a charred mark on the sidewalk. Sean Wench was gathering up Judith, who lay in a crumpled heap beside it. She was wailing, high-pitched and dreadful like a banshee, clutching her protest sign desperately to her chest as her husband led her away through the silently parting crowd toward their house. Something else was on the corner, too– something familiar. Crookedly against the curb, the driver’s door hanging open, was Jefferey’s Chrysler. Its engine was silent, but the headlights were on, lancing through the darkness and the rain.

*I’ll have a word with them*. Jefferey’s voice echoed in Edie’s mind. Silently, peering through a soaked rat's nest of hair in front of her eyes, she scanned the corner for any sign of her husband. There was none except for the car. 

Without a word, Edie shook off the hands of the neighbor who’d caught her. He said something as she walked away, but it was lost on the wind. Edie approached the car and slumped into the driver’s seat. The keys were still in the ignition, and when she turned them, it started right away, the engine still warm. The growl of the engine seemed to snap everybody back to reality, and the crowd began to disperse as Edie shut the car’s door, put it in gear, and slowly rolled down the street to her own house. She parked in the driveway and went inside.

As the door shut behind her, she became viscerally aware of the humming whine; bladed tinnitus. A flickering white light emanated from the living room, and as Edie approached, she could feel the warm dribble as her nose began to bleed again. Yet, there was no dread like before. 

She rounded the corner to the den, delicately clutching the molding of the doorway as she peered in. Crouched in his easy chair and finishing up the meatloaf she’d left on a plate in the fridge, was Jefferey. At least, it was if you didn’t look too closely.

“The meatloaf was delicious, darling,” ‘Jefferey’ said. His voice sounded like TV snow bent into words.

*Jefferey doesn’t like my meatloaf,* Edie thought.

“It wasn’t too dry?” Edie’s voice squeaked from her throat, just above a whisper.

‘Jefferey’s’ lips(?) curled into something like a facsimile of a smile. “*Moist*,” *it* said.

After a moment, Edie smiled back. “Welcome home, Dear.”

It was the first time in recent memory that she’d meant those words.

1qwar3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qwar3r/timemore_no_budget/,Timemore…… [no budget],"While I’ve searched countless posts especially comparing the diff between 064s and 078s - I still need a bit more reassurance. And only for these two models!

I have an Ode2 SSP MP Burrs, but just got a Breville Barista Exp so I want a grinder that can do 80% of my espresso drinks. I drink all types - pour over, French press, moka, cold brew - so variety use is high priority, mainly espresso. I don’t care about looks or speed, or after market burrs (for now). I roast all types of beans. I’m seeing there’s almost no difference between the 064s and 078s :/ despite “work flow” and dialing in (which is more a time issue I guess?) ..but so what! And 064s has less consistency it seems - is that noticeable/bothersome? consider myself a hobbyist/enthusiast to some extent… but can I notice subtle taste or tech differences - no. So I really can’t justify spending $200 min more when I can spend that on other setup needs/upgrades. If quality differences are negligible, what’s the point? My palate is not perfect at noticing too many variables, but I came a long way from loving simple moka pot coffee with my $20 blade grinder…  which I’ll still make…

Is there any reason you’d choose 078s over 064s or vice versa? I just can’t seem to get the point!",0,1770263569.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

– a feed-style interface for lightweight exploration , specially adapted for mobile

– AI extracted Figure 1 + TLDR

– recommendation system like tiktok

The idea isn’t to replace deep reading, but to use these “coffee-line moments” to stay aware of what’s new, and then decide what’s worth sitting down with later.

I’m still unsure whether this kind of feed-based workflow is genuinely helpful long-term or just feels good at first, btw I have a prototype now:

1qwan1o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qwan1o,A light Lithuanian dinner,"It was another day in the coal mines and by the time I got home I didn't want to cook  So I decided on heating up a MRE and landed on this little Lithuanian #6, chicken with buckwheat. What these rations lack in quantity they usually more than make up for in quality. Oddly enough there was no coffee or tea in it or listed. Typically you find the buckwheat porridge in Russian, Ukrainian and other Eastern European rations but I'm happy to have it here. I love these hearty mains and just enough food to leave you feeling complete and not sluggish. in the fourth pic is the main and yes that's the piece of chicken in it. 

The cherry isotonic drink was ok. It has a slight Robitussin flavor which is the one thing I hate about cherry flavored things. It wasn't horrible though and was a 4/10. The other beverage is the pea soup. I believe it was a yellow split pea soup. I had to add a bit of salt but otherwise not half bad especially in the cold. 6/10 for me. 

The chocolate is the good old Ruta bars. They aren't the best and aren't the worst but they get the job done. 7/10 for me. The hazelnuts are extremely plain and not roasted or salted. This seems to be a more or less universal thing across the ration world. Again they weren't horrible but even just roasting them would be amazing. 6.5/10. The crackers are the standard rye hard tack in all of these rations. I added some to the soup and it paired well. I used the rest as the delivery system for my dessert masterpiece. These were a 7/10 because they weren't stale most importantly. The honey was fairly pale and had a slight butter toffee flavor to it that was most welcome. It had a thick, rich consistency that coated the other items well. 7.5/10 for me. 

For a dessert item I went with chocolate hazelnut spread...sort of. A bite of chocolate with a few nuts and an 8/10. Next I dipped the chocolate in the honey and added a few more nuts and a 9/10. Lastly I took all of that on top of the cracker and made a 9.5/10 dessert item. Believe it or not the rye worked well with the honey and you really couldn't taste it through the chocolate and nuts. 

The few of these rations that I've had the opportunity to eat have really been all about the mains and this one was no different. The other items are a welcome addition to round it out but are largely meh. As I stated in the beginning this was chicken with buckwheat. It was hearty and well seasoned with perfectly cooked buckwheat and tender. juicy chicken (thigh I think). The piece of chicken was easily half of the main. Did it need anything extra? No. Could you have added some heat to it? Sure. But it was damn near perfect as is and a 10/10. 

They might not get it right with the peripheral items but they damn sure nail it with the mains. A nice black tea would've been an awesome addition. Overall this is a fantastic ration and the main is one of the best that I've eaten. The sides weren't the best but I don't let that ruin an otherwise fine ration. For me to rate a ration poorly, beyond it being spoiled, it would take super shitty sides and a less than mediocre main and so far I haven't had that. I still have a Singaporean one though. Apparently those are some of the worst. Until next time, stay safe, stay warm and be kind to one another. ",2,1770263256.0,MRE,0,1.0,False
1qwal56,https://www.reddit.com/r/dairyfree/comments/1qwal56/mod_update_for_february/,Mod update for February,"For the past few months, we’ve tested a pinned post for DF recommendations. It seems to be working pretty well, so we’re going to keep it going with some minor modifications. Beginning March 2026, we’ll drop the “new to DF” from the subject line and post content, so that it can be better understood as a general place for recommendations, and we’ll begin removing posts that ask for recommendations and steering users to those pinned posts. 

In the spirit of supporting each other with what can be a challenging diet, we encourage users to develop a habit of looking for that pinned post throughout the month and responding to requests so that we can share more information. Since many of the requests for recommendations are for the same kinds of things (coffee creamer, protein powder, snacks or baked goods) it’s hoped that the pinned posts will help people get those recommendations more easily. 

We’re rolling out another pinned post in response to the frequency of users reporting posts that promote an item, app, or website as spam. We recognize that some people want to see these recommendations, but others don’t. The mods have debated how to handle these posts, and finally decided to create a pinned post for all posts that fall under the category of promotion — surveys, apps, websites, or products. As we test it, these pinned posts will automatically generate every 2 weeks on a Thursday. Users who post promotion content will be notified of the pinned post and asked to share the information there instead. If the posts prove successful, we’ll eventually modify the rule about self-promotion/spam to require promotion content to be posted only in those pinned posts and remove it elsewhere. 

Posts about recipes will continue to be treated separately from promotion, provided the original post or a comment includes recipe information and not simply a link to a blog. Recipe posts that contain only a link to a blog/website and no other substantive content will be removed as spam.

Probably it will take some time to work the bugs out on this, but we hope that it will reduce the number of posts that y’all report as spam. The first post will show up on Thursday, February 5 around noon PST.

Speaking of spam — The automated system continues to flag a lot of posts that are something along the lines of “I bought this DF thing and it’s fabulous” as spam, which is annoying for all of us. We haven’t figured out a way to improve that. The mods approve them as quickly as possible, but we are 4 volunteers who have lives and we appreciate your patience.

##**Tehran - June 20th, 2026**

Karim Sadiq had been there that day in Tehran. He had seen the IRGC massacre his comrades, countless shot dead and more trampled beneath those whose only priority was to run the other way in an attempt to survive. Friends had been shot in front of him, the sight of Shirin’s dying eyes haunted him still. Every night he slept he relived the conversation with her on May 9th, over and over and over. *They’re saying the protest will be tomorrow love,* staring into her eyes. Those beautiful, charming, comforting brown eyes. *Ali and Farid will meet us a few streets down, they said all of Tehran will be going.* She shrugged him off, *love, only months ago we marched these same streets and lost friends and nothing came of it. How many more times?* Karim remembered in excruciating detail, how he turned away from her then to instead look out their window to see Tehran, the city they both loved so dearly, even now he remembered every window light that was on, the soft breeze in the air pushing the leaves of the trees, the crescent moon hanging low in the sky above. *As many as it takes.* She let out her soft giggle, muttered a *my love, fine*, and only twenty four hours later she lay dead. The greatest symbol of oppression the regime could create. Not the office of the supreme leader, but the mass grave that now lay underneath its soil, the grave where Shirin now lay, with thousands of others.

But the time of mourning has passed now. Forty-one days since a small blip in time that nobody else in the world could possibly be familiar with had destroyed his life. Forty-one days of mulling it over in his head, *Do I follow my Shirin? Or do I dare to fight?*. Forty-one days to fortify his plan. The time for action is here, and Karim is set on being the one to change Iran.

His time in mourning had largely been spent gathering supplies and stealing car parts from abandoned cars whenever the area was clear of IRGC patrols. As far as he was concerned, his old ‘97 Paykan sedan has been ship-of-theseus’d to the point of being able to survive the odyssey he has planned. He did a final read through of his checklist, two months of canned food *check*, forty-eight bottles of water *check*, can opener *check*, AK-47 *check*, ammunition *check*, blankets and clothes *check*, knife hidden in boot *check*, forged ID cards for Saveh, Arak, Isfahan, and Shiraz *quadruple check*, cigarettes and lighter *check*, ham radio *check*. A handful of knick-knacks for entertainment purposes were thrown in the glove compartment, alongside an old Makarov that was once his fathers. He stood in his old living room for what he suspected would be the final time. Gave water to the roses that Shirin had given him only weeks before May 10th. As he locked up his house he tapped his coat pocket, making sure all the letters he had written were still there. All that remained now was to say his goodbyes.

Karim knew Farid well, they had been childhood best friends, they hadn’t met in school with Farid being two years older, but their fathers had been best friends and made sure they, too, would follow in their footsteps. As a result, Farid was a simple goodbye. Karim drove to his house, knocked on his door, and handed him a letter. Farid responded with a hug, and a whispered *good luck*. Farid and Karim didn’t need to share any more words to understand what was happening. He knew that if Karim hadn’t killed himself yet, he had a plan, and Farid would do whatever it takes to help. In this case, Farid knew that meant to make this goodbye as easy as possible to the man who he saw much like a younger brother.

The first time Karim had ever seen a man cry was his father when his mother had passed away when he was still very young, it was one of the few memories he held onto of his youth, the fear and confusion it set in him, but also fundamental to the man he would become, being raised by a lone father. The second time Karim had ever seen a man cry, was today when he told Ali he would be going south. While Farid looked at Karim like a younger brother, Ali looked at him much like a father. Ali was only freshly twenty-five, fiercely ideological, and ragingly emotional, the contrast with the isolated, pragmatic, forty-seven year old Karim was a distinct part of why they solidified such a close bond. “You cannot leave us now. There is still so much to be done here in Tehran, brother we need a leader and you can be that,” is what he ended his hour long ramble on. Karim lit up a cigarette, took a heavy drag, held it in his lungs for ten seconds, and let it out in one long sigh. “Ali, I am only a leader so long as there will be those to follow me. I am just as much a leader as you are with your poorly hidden little gang of reds, or Farid is with his other allies in businesses and organizations across the city. You two have what it takes to do something here, we all saw what happened forty-one days ago. This city does not need three leaders and the people of Iran must know what happened here. This will not be the last time we see each other,” another drag of his cigarette, *a likely lie, but one Ali needs to hear,* he thought as he let it out. “When the people of Iran know of the crimes of the Islamic Republic, I will return, and a better future with me.” Karim grabbed one of the letters out of coat pocket and handed it to Ali. “When you see Farid, open them together.” Ali took his letter and embraced Karim in a hug, “I will see you on the other side.” Karim could feel the droplets of tears fall as Ali said that. “And I, you.” Karim responded with.

##**Outskirts of Isfahan - July 3rd, 2026**

Travelling through Saveh and Arak proved easier than Karim had expected, the IRGC had a weaker presence in the cities near Tehran as many had seemingly been called south to combat the Americans or to Tehran proper to quell any riots. He made contact with old friends in both cities, lucking out that many of them were still alive and well, informed them of the May 10th massacre, and left them letters with instructions on what he believed would be necessary. *Gather as many as you can, all those whose loyalties lay not with the Ayatollah but with the people. Wait for the signal from Shiraz, then go to Tehran. Meet with Farid. Create barricades anywhere possible to disrupt the IRGC along the way. Travel on side roads, old paths, mountains ways. Arm yourselves, but only fight to defend, do not attack yet.* They exchanged ham radio signals, so ideally he could still keep contact from the city prior until he reached the next city, and his safety could be told down a lengthy game of telephone back to his old friends in Tehran.

Many wanted to join him going south, to witness the totality of destruction the Americans had brought to the Islamic Republic, and to bring the fight to the IRGC, but Karim knew this was his journey alone. The people and the leaders he was recruiting must be kept safe, and the safest place now would be united together in the heart of Iran. *BANG* An explosion knocked him out of his introspective daydreams. He could see a missile had hit a location off in the horizon, part of the American strikes. It was far enough away that it could be ignored, but Karim knew his luck had finally run out. This proves his greatest worry, the IRGC still has an important presence in Isfahan.

Only a few more minutes passed on his journey towards Isfahan before he saw a vehicle coming towards him in the distance. Details couldn’t be made out besides the fact whoever it was was coming down *fast*. Karim pulled over to the side of the road as they got closer, still not slowing down. Only moments later the truck whipped past him, he only got a brief glance, but saw armed soldiers all sitting in the back. He gave a sigh of relief, lit up a cigarette, and continued into Isfahan.

##**Isfahan - July 3rd, 2026**

A checkpoint into the city. He knew this could be the moment he is fucked. Why the fuck had he taken the highways in? The ease of Qom and Arak had made him cocky. Now he suffers for it. About twenty cars sat in front of him. No, no, he’s fine. He grabbed the box underneath the passenger side seat and scrambled to pull out the right ID card. Eighteen cars in front of him. No that’s the Arak ID, fuck. Seventeen. No that’s Shiraz, would he even make it to Shiraz? Sixteen. Where the FUCK is it? Fifteen. It’s not in the box. Why the fuck is this the one that he’s lost. Thirteen. Okay okay, breathe Karim. The glovebox maybe. He pulled out everything in it, his crosswords fallen to the ground, his Makarov dropped somewhere, his insurance papers a mess, no ID. Eight. He could see the front of the checkpoint now. The IRGC had pulled a man out of a vehicle and was in the middle of tying rope behind his back. He began patting his pockets, the letters all were still there but everything else felt empty. Five. His wallet? Be began throwing cards up and no- Wait. He checked the small pocket dedicated to holding ID cards and there it sat. Omid Kaviani, born and lived in Isfahan all his life. Thank fucking god. He muttered a silent prayer as he drove up to the checkpoint.

“Name.”

“Omid Kaviani.”

“ID.”

Karim handed it over. The IRGC officer stared at it, flipped to the back, stared at it, flipped to the front, stared at it. The seconds passing by felt oppressive, had it been minutes? Why is he still staring. It’s a fucking ID card, not a declaration of war. In the corner of his eye he saw another IRGC soldier checking for bombs underneath his car.

“Reason for leaving the city Mr. Kaviani?”

“Trip to see my children, they live in Arak with their grandparents.”

“Mmhmm.” The officer glanced at the soldier who had been checking the vehicle and got a thumbs up in return. “Alright Mr. Kaviani, welcome home,” he handed Karim back the ID. “The city won’t be allowing people to leave after tonight. Terrorist activity is getting active and  the foreign devils are killing our brothers.”

“Understood, sir,” Karim drove past the checkpoint and began laughing in hysterics, the sweat that had been building on his brow he could feel now running down his face.

***An hour later***

Karim hadn’t seen Ebrahim in close to a decade. They split on rather bad terms, but a small handful of mutual friends had shared to Karim that Ebrahim had believed the past was the past, and it may stay there for the rest of time. Karim only hoped that was true as he rapped on the door of the last address he had known for him. The door opened a crack, “who is it?” the voice whispered out. “I’m here to see Ebrahim,” Karim didn’t want to say his name too loudly, you never know who is listening. “Who. Is. It?” The voice repeated. Karim went silent for a moment, thinking of how to get around this ever-so-paranoid door. “The man who took the sister of Ebrahim.” Silence. Then the door slammed closed. *Note to self, hone the mind better on the trip to Shiraz.* Karim thought before he began considering his backup contacts in Isfahan, not an ideal circumstance but he did know others that could pull some strings. Then he heard the sound of chains being pulled back, locks coming undone, and the door creaking back open.

“Karim,” the man now standing in the doorway said as he looked down to meet Karim’s gaze. He towered over Karim by at least a foot, and Karim considered himself a pretty average height, and while Karim was well built, this man seemed as if his gaze alone could break an arm.

“Ebrahim. We need to talk.”

“I know, I have tea on the kettle.”

The ensuing few hours were spent dancing around the topic at hand. Catching up on life, talking about the Americans, discussing Ebrahim’s business selling tea. But it could only be avoided for so long until Karim would have to say it. “Brother, do you know of Tehran?”

He set his teacup down on the table and stared into Karim’s eyes. Ebrahim had those same brown eyes Shiran had. “I know of the protests, but few in Tehran have any Starlinks, it’s been hard to hear anything in detail.”

Kiram knew that would be the answer. He knew he would have to break the news. He knew it would be a herculean task to proceed to immediately ask a favour of this man afterwards. “They slaughtered us, Ebrahim. Like cattle in a pen. There were hundreds of thousands of us at the office of the supreme leader and then the shots came. I know nobody in the protest fired a shot, it didn’t matter.” Kiram felt the tears begin to swell in his eyes, the rage and anger building. “I’m organizing something. Something bigger than any one of us. For it to work I need your help, I’ve made contact with allies in Saveh and Arak. My instructions are in a letter he-” Ebrahim stood suddenly.

“Where is Shiran?”

The question hung in the air. Kiram truly hoped he could get his ramble out before the question came. He should have known better.

“Is she safe?”

“I,” Kiram could feel the tears begin to fall. “I’m sorry brother. She was shot during the massacre. I tried my best to grab her and help her and get her out but she.” He stopped for a deep breath. “I held her when she died. I left Tehran forty-one days later.”

Ebrahim was facing away from him, but he could see convulsions from his arms. Karim prepared for a punch that never came, instead he saw the behemoth of a man in front of him collapse to his knees. The third time Karim had ever seen a man cry was right now, with Ebrahim mourning the loss of a sister he had already lost ten years ago.

Karim didn’t know what to do, so he got up and sat beside the man. They sat together for a half an hour. Two men who a day ago had little desire to ever see the other, now sat mourning the loss of a beloved, united in understanding. “Do you still smoke?” Ebrahim asked. They each lit a cigarette, Ebrahim still sitting on the floor, staring out the window. Karim rose, refilling the teacups, and returned to the floor with his brother-in-law.

“What is it you’re doing?” Ebrahim asked after he had properly recomposed himself.

Karim took a drag, and began in a low whisper. “The Islamic Republic must fall. The crimes of the regime must be spoken for. I am gathering allies across Sevah, Arak, and here. I will be creating a distraction further south, in Shiraz, when that happens you need to move to Tehran. Farid will be taking the lead from there until I return.” He took another drag. “If I return.”

“Farid huh?”

“He is a close friend and a trusted ally. Ali too, younger man, far younger. He’s young and foolish but he has great aspirations. But he doesn’t fully believe in the democratic movement; he believes in something more… radical.”

“Red?”

Karim gave a nod.

“A bold child,” Ebrahim gave a chuckle. “You know, Shiran and I’s parents were part of the Tudeh Party during the first revolution?”

“I did, she told me plenty of stories of your parents, she said she sees their parents light in the eyes of Ali. I trust him.”

“That’s not my concern, my concern is if that boy can trust you.”

“I promised him we can work together if this idealized future comes to pass.”

“And if they keep up the fight?”

Kiram was growing frustrated now. “Why this examination? We need fighters, people willing to fight for a new future. If Ali and his reds will help us, I will do whatever it takes to make sure they are comfortable in this new future. Discussing hypothetical struggles doesn’t help us with the struggle we are currently fighting. On that, will you be there to answer the call of the second revolution? I know you’re a leader amongst the protesters here.” Karim grabbed his letter out of his pocket and offered it to Ebrahim.

Ebrahim now took a drag from his cigarette and turned to look at Karim, “For the people of Iran, for Shiran, and for our future generations, I will be there when you need me.” He grabbed the letter out of Karim’s hand and set it aside. “You need a place to stay? The couch is available, and I’ll need time to organize with resistance forces to help you out of the city.”

“It would be appreciated, thank you.”

They watched the sun set below the city skyline.

##**Isfahan - July 10th, 2026**

Karim checked his watch, thirty-five minutes to four. Five minutes early, classic. He was a few blocks away from the checkpoint blocking access to the Keshvari Expressway, unsure exactly what the plan was going to be besides being told to “put the pedal to the floor and don't look back.” In the days since he arrived in Isfahan he had met with a plethora of members of the local resistance, led by Ebrahim and a collection of other fascinating figures. They had secured arms and even offered a Starlink terminal, but Karim refused that offer, he couldn’t take any extra risks or draw any more suspicion after the incident he had getting into Isfahan. However, they plan on having some members also leave through the northern Highway 65 checkpoint, the one Karim used to enter the city, to run Starlinks to Arak then Sevah to reduce the reliance on open ham radio frequencies. Supposedly, several other vehicles will be leaving through the same checkpoint as Karim today as well in an effort to set up terminals in the countryside to ensure everybody is coordinated for when Karim sets off the distraction in Shiraz.

He had hope today. The sense of hope he last felt during the May 10th protest before the massacre. It’s the first day he would be able to witness a true act of rebellion against the regime first hand, all of this planning and sacrifice going into just giving him a chance to reach Shiraz. They trusted him, not only that but they believed in him. Today is the first test against the regime.

“Karim!” Ebrahim approached him from behind, giving him a good startle. “Are you ready?”

“Yes brother, what’s the cue?”

“When the fireworks start, drive like hell out of here.” He embraced Karim like a long lost friend then. “Good luck brother, we’ll be waiting for you.”

“And good luck to you, see you brother.” 

And just as quickly Ebrahim appeared, he was gone again. Karim got into his car, pulled out of the alleyway and sat idling on the street, waiting for the fireworks.

*BOOM* … *BANG BANG BANG* … *BOOM BOOM* … *BANG*

Immediately Karim pressed on the gas towards the checkpoint, he saw a car in front of him doing the same, and several behind him following. He didn’t know whether they were IRGC or allies, he didn’t have time to think of that, he focused on the road in front of him. He could hear more explosions happening, further in the distance, he figured that was the second checkpoint getting hit. He took a hard right turn, onto the street where he could clearly see the checkpoint and saw what Ebrahim had been talking about. The entire checkpoint was on fire, with what seemed like a very direct RPG hit at the guard booth, gunfire could be heard and he saw returning fire from the rooftops of neighbouring buildings. The car in front of him zipped past the checkpoint. He glanced in his rearview and saw the cars before were following him still, a man in the passenger seat of one was leaning out of the window and taking shots at the checkpoint, doubling down on the distraction to make sure Karim would make it through. With the soldiers too occupied by the bullets from the roof and the car behind him, he sped past the checkpoint as well with ease.

After he hit the highway he took the first turn onto an unmaintained backroad, and after an hour down that, took a moment to breathe. They had done it, Karim was out of the city. Now everything was back on him.

##**Shiraz - August 1st, 2026**

Frankly, Kiram was shocked at how easy it was to get into Shiraz. No checkpoints, no easy to see IRGC patrols, but he quickly discovered why. The American strikes had hit the city hard, every few blocks there was some blatant rubble from a missile strike, an apartment building missing part of a wall, a ruined house, what was likely a storefront at some point had its sign blown across the street. It looked closer to a warzone then a city, though there were no bullet holes or bodies. He glanced at his notes again to remind himself who he was looking for, Nasim Hayati. She apparently had a big role in the January protests and everyone he spoke to amongst Ebrahim’s cell of resistance fighters swore up and down she would be the best source of contact to start a Shiraz uprising.

He came to what seemed like the right address, an apartment building closer to the downtown core of the city. A young man sitting on the stairs, smoking a cigarette and thumbing through a magazine, with a cafe opposite the building with a fair few people sitting outside sipping on their drinks and talking. The atmosphere felt normal, as if the whole country wasn’t about to fall apart at the seams, as if it hadn’t already been on the brink of that not even a year ago.

Entering the apartment, he looked for the apartment listed: 319. Which very quickly didn’t make sense to him, as there was no 319. Each floor only had 10 apartments in it. Was it supposed to be 310? He made triple sure it was the right number. His growing frustration quickly led him outside, where he went to lean against his car parked out front and smoke a cigarette as he attempted to think what number could have been wrong. Trying to remember every precise detail Ebrahim had said about Nasim.

That was when the young man on the stairs approached him, “Good afternoon, anything I can help you with?”

Suspicion immediately rose within Karim, but he suppressed it enough to try and hold a conversation. “Ah no, just supposed to meet a friend.”

“What’s their number? I live here, and know everyone in the building. Could probably help you out?

“Don’t worry about it, just thinking if I got the number wrong is all.”

“You’re meeting a friend and can’t remember what apartment number they live in? What kind of friend are you?”

He didn’t like where this was going. This man was asking far, far too many questions even for a normal good pedestrian. Karim began to reach into his car, to make sure his Makarov was easily within reach if things went south. That’s when he felt the man grab the note with Nasim’s name and apartment number out of his pocket.

“Nasim huh? You know, part of the code is to ask me ‘hey sir do you know where apartment 319 is.’”

Karim felt completely frozen. “I wasn’t told of any code. Who are you even?”

The man raised out his hand for a handshake, “Sam Hashemi, at your service. I’m guessing *you* are Mr. Karim? Ebrahim let us know you were coming by.”

Immediately Karim got flushed with embarrassment, he was left out of the loop of his own planning. “Yes. I am. Now,” he wanted to immediately get this behind him. “Can I meet with Nasim?”

“Across the street at that cafe there, ask to order a coffee with, three shots of espresso, one ounce of cream, nine packets of sugar. They’ll help you from there.”

Karim felt instant dread, distracting him from everything else. Solely because he found code words and secret orders to be one of the most mind numbing aspects of building a group in secret. Necessary, but he was so glad to have avoided it so far. He left to go do his order, feeling like an absolute fool while muttering the order, and from there the barista led him outside and down a staircase in the neighbouring alleyway, leading him into a tunnel that went on for a good five minutes, before she finally opened a door and Karim got to witness what looked like a fully operational base. Monitors on a screen showing camera feeds, Karim could see one covering the cafe and the apartment he had just been at, wires ran all over connecting different electronics, a map of the city pinned to the wall, and at least a dozen people were being busy bodies around different screens or having conversations with each other.

“Ms. Nasim, Mr. Karim is here to see you.” The barista announced as she closed the door behind her.

The woman closest to the map of the city turned to stare at the new man in the room. “I hear you’re the man that wants to use my people as a sacrificial lamb?”

He was *really* starting to hate this city and the people in it. “That’s not it at all. I want to fight, we need to fight, we all know this I mean, god look what you have here.” He was still in amazement at the organization they’ve built here. “Shiraz is a twofold opportunity. We give the forces I’ve organized on my way here a chance to unite, and we get to show that the regime can be beaten. That people all around us are willing to fight. It’s one thing to say you want a revolution, to band together a group and arm them. It’s another to do it. It’s dominoes from there.”

The woman looked him over. He was incapable of knowing what Ebrahim had told her before he arrived, but he hoped he’d already done most of the convincing.

“I wanted to see if you’re a true believer, not a simply crazy opportunistic idealist.” She moved towards him and outstretched her hand. “Nasim Hayati, leader of the Shiraz resistance. Nice to meet you, formally.”

Karim shook her hand, “Karim Sadiq, revolutionary. The pleasure is mine.”

The initial conversation was one of polite talk, covering the points Ebrahim had already told Nasim, filling in the blanks, discussing the ideal outcome for all of this. Though after only a handful of hours, it shifted to strategy, to planning. How many people would be needed, if they have enough small arms, if the people were ready, and how to make it all happen. It would be at least a month, maybe two, to sufficiently prepare for it. But when it happens, they’ll make sure it’ll draw the attention of any IRGC element in reserve.

There was one point that Nisan made mandatory, besides limiting casualties, upon hearing a simple offhand comment made by Karim early on in his tales of how he got here, when Karim mentioned his promise to Ali. Nisan told Karim that through it all, he will return to Tehran to lead. Karim smiled when she told him that.",1,1770263059.0,GlobalPowers,0,1.0,False

Born in Greece in 1603? Ok cool you'll be an olive farmer and have 7 children. Born in Spain in 1774? Ok maybe work on ships.. sure there's always been social classes and different levels of wealth. But for what it's worth life has always been simple. Hard? Possibly. The biggest obstacle I've faced is choosing a life path. The possibilities are endless and humans aren't supposed to live like this. We are an intelligent species (some of us anyway) but what are we doing? Has life really gotten much better? I sure hope so otherwise everything humanity has accomplished would be for nothing. I've tried downsizing, living a minimalist lifestyle. Did it work? Sure it was convenient and provided less stress from consumerism. I've also worked for multiple agencies and employers in different trade industries. And at each place all I could think is WTF am I doing here? Spending my precious time alive on planet Earth for another dollar? What for? So I can buy more groceries? Maybe a new car? I actually come from wealth and have nothing to complain about. Which is possibly why I've had free time to think about this stuff. It's insanity. I live in the United States if that makes any difference. I look at documentaries of people in tribes and admire how loyal and loving they are to eachother. I have a hard time grasping reality. It seems so finite. It wouldn't be so bad if our society wasn't insane and everyone wasn't bent on oppressing and competing against eachother. What is this? I try to have friends too but it seems nobody has time to foster relationships anymore. Eat, sleep, work, taxes, repeat. This game is sick.

Where is our culture? And I'm not talking about retail shopping, drinking alcohol at bars or watching sports... I'm talking people with character loving, supporting and actively helping eachother. Does it exist anymore? How are people not freaking out about this? What's the future look like? Dystopia? War? A giant public orgy while the empire crumbles like Rome?

An asian lady i went out with only had body pics of herself which I thought was a beautiful body. She was 39 and I'm mid 20s


So i wouldn't want to date someone that old but I was open to a hookup up.

I decided I could take the risk and if she wasn't too unattractive to me maybe it would be okay since she had a nice body. 


However when I met her and saw her face she legitimately looked like she was 60.




I don't know how her body looked so youthful but not her face.
I actually genuinely believe now she was lying about her age.


She could be 50 something or late 40s in my mind.
Can someone really be 39 and look like 60?


We had talked about coffee and then getting a place but when I got there and felt so shocked I just said lets maybe go for a ride and we did then I took her back to her car later. And said was nice to meet you and she said the same then I left and later she unmatched me.

Tl;dr

Met a woman online who only had body pics and claimed to be 39. I was open to a hookup, but when I saw her face in person, she looked much older—like 60. Felt shocked, ended the meetup early, stayed polite, and she unmatched me later. Wondering if she was lying about her age or if some people just age differently.

1qwaf0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Silken_Vic3/comments/1qwaf0n/sf_silver_creek_that_night/,[SF] Silver Creek- that night,"Valerie- later that night

I slink back in my seat, trying to find the energy to get up, but I know I never will. Not to deal with what’s inside. 

I grab my bag from the back and sigh, remembering the science homework I still have to do. It’s easy for me, just.. tedious.  I have enough going on. 

I jam my key in the front door and it opens with a loud creak, making me wince. Is it too loud? I freeze, listening for any noise and sigh in relief when I’m met with silence, aside from the heavy breathing.

 My nose crinkles once the smell hits me. Alcohol, something salty, and more alcohol. I stare at the body that is supposed to be my dad laying across the couch, he doesn’t move, just breathes heavier. Guess he woke up and didn’t want to. I tiptoe over to him and pick up a few half empty bottles and dump them into the sink, putting them into a bag, feeling my way to the trash can. I refuse to turn the lights on. I don’t want him waking up and getting frustrated. 

I ignore the papers with words stamped with red rotting on the coffee table. I can deal with that when I get paid again. For now I have science to do. I don’t have time to worry about something that’s been happening for.. 

How long has it been? My eyes sting as I try to remember exactly when things went downhill so I shake my head, pushing those thoughts away. I can’t think about that right now. I might get stuck in the past. Just like him.  


Azora’s POV-that same night

I’ve completed all of my homework, I’ve journaled, I drank hot cocoa, I’ve showered. I’ve done everything! So why am I pacing as if I have forgotten something? 

I stop my pacing when my foot brushes against something. I have only recently cleaned my room so what could possibly-

“Oh,” I breathe aloud, holding up the slip of paper that girl gave me. Is this what I was worried about? 

“It’s not like I need to contact her anyway,” I say to myself, “I am fine.” Why is there a waver in my voice?

Brushing that concern away I walk over to my desk and pick up my phone from where it was charging. I’m going to message her- just to tell her I do not need her help. I have everything under control. I am the Valedictorian after all. It is my brand, what I’m known for. 

I tell this to myself as I type the numbers in and send the message:



*Hello. Is this the girl who left me a paper with your contact information in the bathroom?  I am the girl you talked to. What was your name?*  
  


I almost put my phone back down, but remember that I never told her my name. How rude of me.



*Sorry. I forgot to tell you my own name.  I am Azora Russo.* 



Will she even see it tonight? Is it too late to be messaging someone? 

I start pacing again.  


Melody’s POV- later that night 

I’m knee deep in fabrics, pins, pencils, and scratch paper. I’ve been busy since I got home and it’s like 9 o’clock at night! I love this so much! I’ve gotten in about five new orders of dresses today and if I include the other three I still need to finish.. that’s eight in a week! Business is booming! 

I just wish I took more time to organize before I jumped in. I can’t find anything.  

That's going to be future-Melody's problem now. If I can remember to clean my studio that is. I need to start writing this stuff down.  
I’m reaching for some chiffon fabric when I hear the chirping notification from my phone. That’s weird, I wasn’t expecting any texts today..

My phone goes off again and I frantically try to find it under all of the fabrics and I shriek when it goes off again and I STILL haven’t found it, but then my hand hits something hard. 

“Ow!” I whine, “Oh wait!” I dig around in that same spot again and pull out my phone, “Ta-da!” I cheer. Now who texted me?  
I skim over the messages thinking it might be someone reaching out about a dress or alteration, humming along to my music as I do.   
“WHAT??” I screech before I can stop myself, “OMG SHE TEXTED ME!!” I launch from my spot on the floor and do a victory lap around my messy work station. Right! I need to respond!  
  


*OMG HI! 😄 I didn’t know if you would text, but I’m so glad you did! How was your evening?* 



I smile a little too wide as the dots appear. I actually doubted if she would reach out for a moment there. I’m so glad I was wrong! I just saw that she looked stressed and I want to help her. I think I’m good at helping. That’s what Mom says at least. Oh!



*Azora:   My evening has been alright. Sorry for the late message, I didn’t think about the time.. How is your evening?* 



Melody:  *It’s totally fine! I was already up trying to find my way through my sea of fabrics anyway. I have about eight orders to finish by next week.*  



Wait, does she even know about my business? Stupid, stupid. You need to stop assuming people know things. 



Azora:  *Oh. That sounds stressful.. But the reason I decided to text you was because..*



Huh, what happened? Did her phone die? Wait, I see the dots again. I’ll let her take her time. Might as well look for the chiffon while I wait. 

Minutes later I hear another text come through. As soon as I found the chiffon, too. Guess I’ll just have another late night then. That’s fine, there’s a reason we have energy drinks!



Azora:   *I was going to say I didn’t need you or anyone else’s ‘help,’ but the truth is.. I have been slightly stressed. It’s a weird feeling and I don’t like it.* 



Melody:   *I get that! I feel like that, too, sometimes with my business and stuff. A way to sort of help is to only worry about what you can control instead of stressing over things you can’t control. Does that make sense?*  
  


Azora:  *Hm.. just worry about what I can control.. Alright I’ll give it a try. Thanks for letting me talk. I’ll let you get back to your orders now.* 



I’m halfway through typing, telling her that it wasn’t a bother-really when she sends another text saying I never told her my name. Really? When did she even..?

I scroll back up and there it is clear as day, “*What was your name?”*  Wow, I need to start paying more attention.  What even distracted me? Right!



Melody:   *I’m so sorry! I completely missed that text somehow 😅 My name’s Melody! And I own a shop where I make dresses and can alter or mend anything related to fabric, I forgot to actually tell you what I did earlier, too. Have a good rest of your night!* 



After that I shake my hands out and begin following the pattern for this mermaid-styled dress. I should’ve finished it yesterday, but I didn’t have the time to do anything but the design-they want pearls in a pattern on one side and nothing on the other.

 I’ve just gotten seated when I hear my name being called from downstairs. By the tone of voice I can tell it’s going to be another long venting session. Mom has a new boss that’s stressing her out and she’s been staying later at the office and since I’m usually up.. Yeah today just wasn’t meant to be a work day I guess. Stealing one last glance at the half-finished dress I make my way to the stairs.

I can do more tomorrow. 



Jade’s POV- even LATER that night 

I’m staring at the ceiling. Again. I can’t sleep. Again. I reach for my phone, refusing to sit up all the way. I squint and the glow, no matter how low the brightness is it still feels too bright. 2:47AM. Yay, looks like I’m going to be up the rest of the night. 

I’m pretty sure this has to be insomnia, I once stayed up a whole day, but still couldn’t sleep once the sun went down. Or maybe I’m just a vampire. I’m already pale as the moon. Might as well commit. 

Ugh. I used to be able to sleep because I had someone to talk to. My boyfriend, well not really anymore, but I don’t know. The whole thing is weird.  

“This is stupid,” I say to the ceiling. 

*You’re stupid,*  it says back, *you’re the one who can’t sleep.*

Touché. I’m leaving now. I refuse to sit and stare at the ceiling. I could at least look at some stars. 

Grabbing my jacket, I open my window and slip out. I’m so glad our house is kind of small, even more glad that my aunt fell asleep on the couch after she finished off half a bowl of ice cream. I wish I could sleep like that, I’m so tired of being tired. 

I slip out the window and land by the bushes and walk down to the edge of the driveway, blasting alternative rock in my headphones. It’s already getting colder. Just like 9th grade. I snort, letting a small smile slip. Since when was I so reminiscent?  Taking a seat by the mailbox, I groan into my hands. Fine. I pull out my phone again, to text this time. 

*U up?* 

I’m not expecting anything, he usually sleeps like a baby. Instead I see the bubbles start typing not even a minute later. 

*I was wondering if you were gonna text or not. Let me guess..  can’t sleep?*



It’s annoying that he always knows.

Not only do I feel lonely, but I realise that the few friends I have, are kind of losers. When I say losers, I don’t mean they are sucking at their career, they are. But they are not hard workers. I would have more respect for them if they worked hard. They are not only unemployed, but they are giving up opportunities in order to get better ones. They are not dumb by any means. They are actually intelligent, but they seem to be falling behind.

I want to make more friends. Why do I feel this profound anger towards these friends of mine? I want them to succeed, I want them to rise. I don’t know if it’s because of the excess coffee I am drinking lately, but I am so angry at them that I feel like lashing out.

I don’t seem to have alot of CLOSE friends. I do have friends who aren’t very close. Sometimes I feel as if people are friends with me because of my success. 

I’m just venting here. When I say it’s lonely at the top, I’m not implying that I am at the top by any means. But what I mean is that as I rise, I feel more alienated from people. I can’t relate to why they make poor choices. I still have a long way to go, but the road seems more lonely with time. There are people out there who are successful and have a bunch of close to heart friends, right? They have friends who are their friends because of their personality and not because of ther success? Like in the movies? 

To the brothers and sisters out there who are hyper ambitious, what is it like? Are your paths to success riddled with loneliness? Do you have a group of friends who are successful just like you?

When I get a mocha from a cafe, I’m insanely focused for hours — like borderline Adderall-level focus. Super clean, no jitters, just locked in.

At home though, I used to have a DeLonghi Dedica, and no matter what I did (even 3–4 shots), it barely did anything cognitively. I tried different beans, different amounts, etc. Taste was fine, but the effect just wasn’t there.

I’m wondering:

	•	Is this an extraction / grinder issue more than caffeine amount?

	•	Do cafes extract caffeine differently (pressure, grind consistency, freshness)?

	•	Should I upgrade my machine if so which one?

Basically:

If I want cafe-level mental focus at home, do I need a proper espresso setup, or is there a simpler way to get close?

Not chasing latte art — just want the same clean stimulant effect I get from cafes.

It’s fairly spacious: the kitchen area is near the entrance, then there’s a couch and coffee table, and on the other end I have my bed with a desk. I do have a chimney/range hood, but everything is open-planned .

Whenever I cook, the entire apartment ends up smelling like food. I’m not even cooking anything pungent like spices or paste —just eggs for breakfast or things like grilled chicken, or regular food in the air fryer. Everything else is either sautéed or just cut and eaten directly.

Right now, I have to open the windows for an hour or two with the fans on, then close everything and use an air freshener. In the worst-case scenario, I have a fairly large balcony, so I’m thinking about putting a table and a stove out there. I like cooking inside and it will be a lot of work and money for that setup so any tips would help ( also the smell is noticeable not headache inducing but  I sorta think it’s getting on to other furniture and my stuff which I don’t want ) ",1,1770262505.0,ApartmentHacks,2,1.0,False

Hi All,

Just got a Lelit Elizabeth about 1.5 months ago. I love it, it makes great espresso. I have noticed that I'm getting some weird gurgling noises on startup during the initial heatup of the machine -- iat seems like this is fairly normal. However it also seems that steam is coming up from the bottom front of the machine -- this is more worrying. I hit up customer support at Clive Coffee, and they had me take the top off to look for steam leaks, but I could not identify any.

 

The amount of steam that is emitted during startup seems to vary. The video I'm attaching is one with more steam than usual.

 

Has anybody run into this? Noises or the steam coming out? Any sense of whether this is kinda normal or actually problematic? Thanks so much!",1,1770262488.0,Lelit,0,1.0,False

Divided Hearts

Chapter 1

Friday, October 23rd, 2023

It was early Friday morning in the Liete household, one of their houses anyway. No, their family isn’t rich and owns multiple houses. They’re divorced. Elena’s Mother Chrissy gets her daughter from Monday through Friday from January through June with her father seeing Elena on the weekends. Elena’s Father Patrick gets her from July through December with her mother getting Elena during the weekend. Birthdays and Christmas are the toughest times of the year for Elena, as she only gets to spend the special days with one parent. On this particular day, Elena found herself at her father's house. Elena sprawled out on her bed. It was around 6:45 in the morning. Elena was prepared for another day at school. She went to King Charles Collegiate in Gander Newfoundland, and she had been going there for the past few years. She was a high school senior and was already partially into her senior year. Besides attending school full time, Elena was also holding down a part-time job at a local pizza place called “Peter’s Pizza” which was a very popular local pizza place. Elena dragged herself out of bed as she heard her father's hefty footsteps approaching her room and knocking firmly on the door “Elena! You up?” He called out.

Elena sighed and called back out “Yes!” Before asking her father “Is it alright if I go to Nana’s after school?” She asked politely.

That’s when her door opened. “You spend more time with your grandmother than you do here at the house..” He pointed out with a bit of a chuckle.

Elena thought her father was going to shout at her but he smiled and patted her on the back “I gotta stay late at the firehouse tonight anyway, you just call me when you get home okay?” He asked, “Have a great day.” He said before walking out of her room.

Elena watched her father leave and waved “You too!” She called back.

It was rare to catch him in a good mood. But she knew that when got home she had to pack to go to her mother's for the weekend. It was an exhausting schedule, especially since she had to work all weekend. Which puts a strain on their relationship. She went to the bathroom and brushed out her chestnut brown hair, brushed her teeth, and got dressed for the upcoming school day. Elena made her way down the hallway to the kitchen to grab a banana for her breakfast. Elena was tired from the work day she had yesterday, she wondered if her manager had found her a replacement shift partner since her previous one had a meltdown and quit on the spot.

Eventually, the time came around for Elena to head to school, she fumbled around for her keys and made her way out to her car, it was an old black Honda Civic she got from her mother and father, being one of the last things they collectively bought her together. Elena began her drive to school but made a quick stop at Tim Hortons to get her daily iced coffee. It was a staple in her day and she couldn’t live without it if she had tried. Elena arrived at her school shortly after, pulling into the student parking lot ten minutes before school began. Elena was on her phone minding her own business when suddenly her passenger door swung open!

“You were supposed to text me when you got here!” A girl's voice said with some joking annoyance.

Elena’s face lit up when she saw her best friend Alexis slide into her vehicle. “You need to get better at checking your phone.” Alexis teased.

Elena and her friend laughed together, as they had known each other since middle school and had been inseparable. Not wanting to be outdone by her best friend, Elena fired back with her quip, saying, “Yeah well, at least you don’t have to wonder if I’ll be at school or not!” Elena teased back, referring to Alexis’s spotty attendance record.

Alexis spoke up to defend herself “Okay but in my defense my grades are pretty good for someone who goes for one full day a week!” She said, praising herself.

Elena gave a pitiful applause for her friend’s minor achievement and began again “Applications for Memorial open soon. Are you gonna apply?” Elena asked Alexis, who shrugged her shoulders.

“I doubt it, I like to just go at my own pace, that’s too overwhelming for me.” Alexis finished. Elena’s smile turned to a slight frown as she looked into the pale blue eyes of her friend.

“Oh come on..” Elena sighed “Imagine me and you sharing a dorm! Sharing a bathroom! It’ll be just like we dreamed, Lexi!” Elena visioned.

Alexis looked for a way to get out of this conversation and put her hand on the door handle “Come on we’re gonna be late..” She said, with a bit of annoyance in her voice, she turned back to Elena and said “By the way, those dorms are shit.” Alexis said bluntly before slinging her bag over her shoulders and walking off towards the school.

I played a game with every Plant Strategy deck until it won. I'm not counting wins due to the opponent conceding immediately, but I also don't count losses if the opponent blatantly caused a Galacta-Cactus soft-lock as a ragequit (If I was in a winning position)

In this part we'll talk about Green Shadow and Solar Flare's decks first, I'll put a Tier List of each deck at the bottom the post if you want my overall opinion. This tier list will be updated as each part releases. **It's not ordered within tiers.**

Oh, and I started in Gold League for this, in fairness I should've pushed to Diamond at least first, but I'm considering doing a Zombies sequel to this if the posts do well, and Gold league matches up with Silver-Taco league and leaves out Ultimate Champion (which usually has the occasional good samaritan who will concede to help you out and isn't much different)

Now let's begin.

# Green Shadow

**Easy Peasy**

https://preview.redd.it/xc684fxq4lhg1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=3adb5863a86bf66d9906eee3cc6a1a6da7923545

This deck surprised me quite a bit, it was the first deck I used in the challenge and it did really well. While you're liable to brick turn 1, you usually have a smooth ramp from there, and can create threats reliably with Grow-shroom/Podfather.

There's lots of token *(1x)* copies of strong cards, likely because this is meant to be a budget-friendly beginner deck-list, but every one of them helps in some way and you're usually happy to draw them.

This isn't a super viable deck by any means, but it's a good starting deck for a newer player and can become a lot better with some tweaks.

You're obviously vulnerable to control, but that's going to be a trend for these strategy decks in general, and for what it is, the deck works well.

*Overall Rating: 'Surprisingly Good'*



**Mean Beans**

https://preview.redd.it/932t3iw06lhg1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=f588c71b1af1cd1555efdff4c0273791acf5fac0

This one is more coherent than the previous deck, but that doesn't make it good. That said, this deck isn't by any means weak. Onion Rings is terrifying if you get the opportunity to play him.

The game plan makes sense, you chip at the opponent with ANB like a usual bean deck, but the idea is that you're holding off the zombies until the Onion Rings play, then you flood the board with cheap 4/4 Weenie Beanies from Bean counter (which ramps directly into Onion Rings)

Obviously this deck suffers from the same weaknesses beans normally have, but also has weird choices like adding Coffee Grounds and Espresso Fiesta (and sure, the latter is broken right now, but doesn't fit into this strategy super well), I assume the devs wanted to properly showcase GS's bean selection, but it weakens the deck.

One advantage this deck has is that you'll rarely run into zombie field clear (which is a point that will be very relevant for later decks), since the Zombies can struggle with AoE removal (And are running less of it in favor of more targeted removal nowadays) to a certain extent, Z-mech can be an awful matchup though, and you should play around Weed Spray if possible obviously.

**Winter Melon is Coming**

https://preview.redd.it/ejslmaqi7lhg1.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=459235f277ce16d323e575074652c3299ff6a5da

This deck is a mess. An unholy abomination. A true sin. Let's go over why.

First of all, Freeze in 2026? Post-Janitor? Come on.

Then there's the fact you're running too many copies of Jolly Holly (a strong freeze card, but one that can be awkward to draw), 1 copy of Brainana/Snapdrag, 1 copy of Red Plant-It for only god knows what reason (it doesn't buff Winter Melon's splash, it doesn't address its vulnerabilities, it's overkill on an already setup Snowdrop, and it's too expensive as your only environment replacement option)

This deck has one saving grace: Captain Cucumber. If you're lucky, he can conjure enough strong legendaries to fix this deck, but outside of that, you don't do enough earlygame, and you're certainly not doing enough lategame. Winter Melon is not the threat it used to be pre-Galactic Set, despite its buffs.

Did I mention how awkward Freeze is nowadays yet?

Anyways, I got lucky and won my first game with this deck due to Cucumber + Embiggen, but I don't really count that as a proper validation of the deck. 

*Overall Rating: 'Divine Intervention Required'*

  
**Wish Upon a Starfruit**

https://preview.redd.it/orswm7xz8lhg1.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=dce0277fc3034b0ad9fdbc22e241856c60fb251e

I'm gonna be honest, while I was realistically winning the game anyways, my opponent ragequit after I played a third Mars Flytrap towards the lategame, they were so done with the block meter theft lmao.

That said, this deck does pretty well nowadays. It's not what I'd call strong, but if the zombie player lets you, you can create a devastating board. Bonk Choy's team-up buff powered up this deck to the max, and Cucumber isn't as awkward here as it was last deck (since it can be boosted reliably, plant-fooded, and might bait out removal that would've been better spent on Starfruit)

Only super questionable card here might be Snakegrass, but I've grown fond of this card during this challenge, Zombie Players underestimate this card a lot more than you'd think. It's also a natural play with Lily of the Valley, since it makes the first snakegrass a lot harder to remove.

*Overall Rating: 'Will Sometimes Win'*

  
**Sow the Seeds**

https://preview.redd.it/h4mpnn1t9lhg1.png?width=782&format=png&auto=webp&s=3492f26d0fc2da25bb03544c74df0005fc8de81f

This isn't even really a Bean Deck, it's more of a showcase of Dinoroar than anything.

Lilypad is deceptively good here, even if ALL you do with Lilypad is place a Lima on top, the Leafy conjure into Dinoroar is at least a tolerable play. Almost everything in this deck wants to be played on Lilypad, a card that the zombie player will ignore more often than they should, but can still be protected by Umbrella Leaf just in case.

You're very likely to draw a turn 1 (unlike a lot of these decks), and Clique is pretty damn strong. Combining it with Magic Beans being added to the deck means you are more likely to draw something good. It's not a super strong synergy or anything, but Clique Peas being generally strong is pretty damn nice.

If you want to make this deck actually viable, leaning into the Leafy Synergy here would actually be pretty good. You'd obviously want to ditch Sow entirely, and probably all of your Moonbeans too (but maybe keeping 1-2). Token copy of Bird is weird here, it's not like the rest of the deck is cheap, could def slot in 1-2 more, and probably take out Bamboozle.

Also this is one of two decks that actually run Grave Mistake (the other not being a Rose deck surprisingly), and while you probably wanna knock that down to 2 copies, I really missed this card during this challenge. Graves were painful 95% of the time.

Anyways, this is a strong deck, it's not meta or super viable, but it's going to get good results on average, although this is moreso due to the power of Apotatosaurus' Untrickable more than anything else.

*Overall Rating: 'Surprisingly Good'*



# Solar Flare

Oh boy, this hero's been notorious recently both for her current viability and.. other things. Not all of her decks are going to reflect that too much for the most part though, since not all of them take full advantage of the plant's buffed repertoire of cards.

**Spore Galore**

https://preview.redd.it/5c7p2s5ublhg1.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e6f40cc4abfe428758a795794fc75bab92ad0ed

Remember what I said about the lack of AoE Zombie removal recently? This deck really takes advantage of that.

That doesn't make it SUPER good or anything, but it has good options.

Pineclone' infamous reputation as a bad win condition unironically works well in its favor here, as the zombie hero will rarely have a good answer to a Pineclone horde nowadays. Extinction Event still sees use, but it's fell out of favor as of late.

Almost noone plays around Gloom-shroom too, so you can sometimes win the game because the zombie player left their board entirely vulnerable to it.

Mushroom Grotto is slow, of course. That said, that can sometimes work in its favor, as it can replace the zombies' generally stronger environments due to its timing.

Anyways, I've hyped this deck up a lot, but realistically, you're not going to beat a proper deck against it, and you're very liable to burn out entirely. The Token sunshroom is funny, since if you actually somehow play it turn 1, the Zombie player might think you're playing an actual SF deck, and will use one of their better removal options on it. It's otherwise dead weight.

This deck's hard counter matchups will really destroy it, mainly hearty heroes, definitely Z-Mech (although you might get lucky and he misses super all game), and I lost to a splash deck running deadly Space Ninja on my first attempt with this deck.

Molekale is an alternative win condition, but it can rely on Pineclone to be good a little too much, it's appreciated though and it's only two copies anyways.

Well this is certaintly one of the decks of all time.

Don't get me wrong, it's not ""Winter Melon is Coming"" bad, but it's still pretty bad. I ended up winning my first game with it, but I got lucky.

That's how you'll be winning a lot of your games with this deck (against actual opponents), you'll get lucky. Cosmic Flower high-roll potential is good, Reincarnation high-roll potential is good (and it's a decent turn 1 play if need be), and Briar Rose is a threat Zombie Players aren't used to seeing (but Rocket Science is a good way to shut it down)

The Token Squash and Cherry Bomb are quite dumb, either run one or the other, preferably Squash. 4 Dandelion Kings is overkill. Debatably 4 Briar Rose is overkill too but I had a much more horrid time with WK's flower deck due to missing the 4 Briar Rose copies all game, so I'm not complaining too much. 4 Solar Winds is cringe (but at least CAN ramp into Briar Rose), but most plant environments are tbf. Metal Petal is slow and doesn't do enough, and doesn't ramp into anything except Dandelion King (or Briar Rose + Blooming Heart I guess)

Overall, while the 4x Berry Blasts, Strikethrough RNG, and highroll potential make this a remotely tolerable deck, i'm not approving of it anytime soon.

Okay this is just a typical Solar Flare control deck lmao.

There's slight room for improvement, but overall the deck makes sense.

Struggles against Gravestones of course, like all Solar Flare decks, and COULD use some ramp potentially, but overall you could just pick this up and be a typical SF menace, maybe swapping a few cards for Fig while you're at it.

Not much to say about this one, my opponent ragequit before I even played the Corns, wonder why.

While the Solar Winds in this deck are awkward af, this deck is like the last one, it's just what Solar Flare does today, minus Fig of course. Toadstool is surprisingly smart here, since it ramps directly into Astro if left alone.

I don't really have much to say that you don't all already know here, Cosmoss is super good, 4x berry blasts is always nice, Twin Sun ramps into multiple cards, Wing Nut is nice control, and there's 9 cards here you want to play on your Pair Pearadise.

For those who are new to the game, Solar Winds is here because it used to cost 2 Sun, and was a natural ramp after a turn 1 cosmoss. But it was too powerful at 2 Sun back then, and was nerfed to 3 sun, making it virtually unusable. That said, it's the only really awkward part of this deck, and it just kind of works in this meta in general, and would fit in naturally with even a little bit of deck tweaking.

No joke, my opponent completely ignored my Sunflower Seeds all game in favor of literally anything else, in utter fear of what horrors I would unleash with a sunflower at my disposal, only to die to the sheer amount of chip damage. I had two lanes of sunflower seeds that were basically untouchable all game.

I also did end up Cro-maging them as well, and even then the opponent would remove ANYTHING else but those sunflower seeds, the 4/2 seeds that are the actual threat now and not the potential cornucopia that can whiff in my hand.

Zombie Players, are you okay? What did the seed do to you?

Anyways, Elder Berry is still good even after the health nerf, shoving 5 strikethrough damage in a lane will always be strong, and speaking of: Astro Vera is really good here, and even if it goes down, its seed is surprisingly good fodder for Cro Mag

Again, awkward Solar Winds, but remember: this environment used to be really good, and while it's quite awful now, you at least have a way to replace zombie environments? Glass half-full and all.

Realistically, you shouldn't be lasting long enough for the corns to matter, but you can def ramp into them if left to your devices.

This deck isn't a meta powerhouse by any means, but it's got some solid synergies and can pressure hard in the midgame, but I really miss having Berry Blast here.

## The Problem

Manually creating zones for every hospital, school, or restaurant in your city is tedious. Coordinates, radius settings, names - it's a pain.

## The Solution

I built a custom integration that automatically creates HA zones from OpenStreetMap data. Just pick a POI type and city, done.

## What It Does

- **40+ POI types**: Hospitals, schools, restaurants, parks, gas stations, etc.
- **Auto-discovery**: Finds all POIs within X km of your city
- **Smart sizing**: Small clinics get 105m zones, major hospitals get 280m
- **Generic automations**: Templates that auto-adapt when zones change
- **Weekly updates**: Stays current with OSM data

## Real Example: Hospital Alerts

I wanted notifications when family was at a hospital for 30+ minutes. The integration:
1. Found all 8 hospitals in Syracuse automatically
2. Created zones with intelligent sizing
3. Enabled a generic automation that works for any hospital

No hardcoded zone names - it dynamically discovers zones from sensor attributes. Add a new hospital? Automation just works.

## Installation

**HACS Custom Repository:**
```
https://github.com/DEADSEC-SECURITY/ha-poi-zones
```

Then: Settings → Add Integration → POI Zones

## Example Automation

```yaml
# Alerts when anyone is at a hospital 30+ minutes
# Automatically finds all hospital zones - no hardcoding!
# See GitHub for full template
```

## Use Cases

- Alert when kids arrive at school
- Turn on lights near home depot
- Track elderly parent hospital visits
- Log fuel stops at gas stations
- Start coffee when near favorite cafe

## Data Source

OpenStreetMap (free, open, community-maintained)

## v1.0.0 Features

✅ 40+ POI types
✅ Dynamic radius sizing (healthcare)
✅ Generic automation templates
✅ Worldwide support
✅ Weekly auto-updates
✅ Full sensor data (addresses, phones, hours)

## Links

**GitHub**: https://github.com/DEADSEC-SECURITY/ha-poi-zones
**HACS**: Custom repo (link above)

Feedback welcome! What POI types would you use?

Divided Hearts

Chapter 1

Friday, October 23rd, 2023

It was early Friday morning in the Liete household, one of their houses anyway. No, their family isn’t rich and owns multiple houses. They’re divorced. Elena’s Mother Chrissy gets her daughter from Monday through Friday from January through June with her father seeing Elena on the weekends. Elena’s Father Patrick gets her from July through December with her mother getting Elena during the weekend. Birthdays and Christmas are the toughest times of the year for Elena, as she only gets to spend the special days with one parent. On this particular day, Elena found herself at her father's house. Elena sprawled out on her bed. It was around 6:45 in the morning. Elena was prepared for another day at school. She went to King Charles Collegiate in Gander Newfoundland, and she had been going there for the past few years. She was a high school senior and was already partially into her senior year. Besides attending school full time, Elena was also holding down a part-time job at a local pizza place called “Peter’s Pizza” which was a very popular local pizza place. Elena dragged herself out of bed as she heard her father's hefty footsteps approaching her room and knocking firmly on the door “Elena! You up?” He called out.

Elena sighed and called back out “Yes!” Before asking her father “Is it alright if I go to Nana’s after school?” She asked politely.

 That’s when her door opened. “You spend more time with your grandmother than you do here at the house..” He pointed out with a bit of a chuckle.

 Elena thought her father was going to shout at her but he smiled and patted her on the back “I gotta stay late at the firehouse tonight anyway, you just call me when you get home okay?” He asked, “Have a great day.” He said before walking out of her room.

Elena watched her father leave and waved “You too!” She called back.

It was rare to catch him in a good mood. But she knew that when got home she had to pack to go to her mother's for the weekend. It was an exhausting schedule, especially since she had to work all weekend. Which puts a strain on their relationship. She went to the bathroom and brushed out her chestnut brown hair, brushed her teeth, and got dressed for the upcoming school day. Elena made her way down the hallway to the kitchen to grab a banana for her breakfast. Elena was tired from the work day she had yesterday, she wondered if her manager had found her a replacement shift partner since her previous one had a meltdown and quit on the spot.

Eventually, the time came around for Elena to head to school, she fumbled around for her keys and made her way out to her car, it was an old black Honda Civic she got from her mother and father, being one of the last things they collectively bought her together. Elena began her drive to school but made a quick stop at Tim Hortons to get her daily iced coffee. It was a staple in her day and she couldn’t live without it if she had tried. Elena arrived at her school shortly after, pulling into the student parking lot ten minutes before school began. Elena was on her phone minding her own business when suddenly her passenger door swung open!

 “You were supposed to text me when you got here!” A girl's voice said with some joking annoyance.

 Elena’s face lit up when she saw her best friend Alexis slide into her vehicle. “You need to get better at checking your phone.” Alexis teased.

Elena and her friend laughed together, as they had known each other since middle school and had been inseparable. Not wanting to be outdone by her best friend, Elena fired back with her quip, saying, “Yeah well, at least you don’t have to wonder if I’ll be at school or not!” Elena teased back, referring to Alexis’s spotty attendance record.

Alexis spoke up to defend herself “Okay but in my defense my grades are pretty good for someone who goes for one full day a week!” She said, praising herself.

 Elena gave a pitiful applause for her friend’s minor achievement and began again “Applications for Memorial open soon. Are you gonna apply?” Elena asked Alexis, who shrugged her shoulders.

 “I doubt it, I like to just go at my own pace, that’s too overwhelming for me.” Alexis finished. Elena’s smile turned to a slight frown as she looked into the pale blue eyes of her friend.

 “Oh come on..” Elena sighed “Imagine me and you sharing a dorm! Sharing a bathroom! It’ll be just like we dreamed, Lexi!” Elena visioned.

Alexis looked for a way to get out of this conversation and put her hand on the door handle “Come on we’re gonna be late..” She said, with a bit of annoyance in her voice, she turned back to Elena and said “By the way, those dorms are shit.” Alexis said bluntly before slinging her bag over her shoulders and walking off towards the school.

Had a lovely trip in 2016 to Zion/Bryce and stayed at the Arrowhead Country Cabins which I really liked. Got to the park early or came later in the day as was necessary even then and appreciated the less touristy vibe. 
Now I know the parks have changed since COVID and I am nervous about logistics and how busy it will be (to the point of trying to find more things outside the main canyon to do). 
Taking my husband in late March/early April who has never been (nervous about Easter week as it's mentioned on the nps website as a busy time and school breaks). Would like him to see the main sites on the shuttle but also OK to avoid the hot spots to do a more obscure hike. Every post here is like Springdale one million %.

To me the pros of staying on the East Side are:
More time to spend at Bryce as we can get there earlier
Closer to the beautiful east side vistas/hikes
Closer to some slot canyons that we could do - buckskin gulch, red hollow. 
Closer to the East Mesa Trail which I definitely want to do to Observation Point with the shuttle 
Accomodations are more peaceful
Much cheaper than Springdale

Cons
Obviously a very early day when we would plan to park at Zion visitor center. 
Further from airport and Kolob Canyons (if we choose to do that if Zion is too packed)
Fewer dinner / early coffee options (I assume), Kanab is 20 min drive which after a long day we might not be up for vs convenience of dining in Springdale (did enjoy Thunderbird)
For Springdale was looking at Bumbleberry.

1qw9rab,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1qw9rab/my_complicated_convoluted_journey_to_christianity/,"My Complicated, Convoluted Journey to Christianity: A Lengthy Memoir","**In The Beginning**

I was seven years old when I watched someone die for the first time. I still remember sitting in the hospital room that night as I played my Game Boy Advance to pass time as the family sat around, watching my grandfather dying of leukemia. The previous day, a minister had come into the room to ask my grandfather if he would accept Jesus so that he could go to Heaven. He accepted, crying, and they prayed together. I don’t know if my grandfather really believed it, or if he was just afraid.

Neither side of my family had been religious in at least 2-3 generations. My mother was a doubtful agnostic who had little to say about religion beyond “this makes people feel better.” My father was a Mormon for a brief period before I was born, but was kicked out of his church (I don’t know why) - after that, he became agnostic and never brought the topic up.

My parents didn’t have anything to say about religion, but they did have a few spooky stories of paranormal encounters with ghosts which fascinated me.

I believe the ghost stories, plus witnessing a death at so young an age, helped ignite the insatiable curiosity I quickly grew to have about existential questions.

I still remember the first time I dared to ask “Why?” - I was sitting in the bathtub at my grandparents house not long after my grandfather passed, surrounded by bubbles and a rubber ducky. I looked up at the ceiling and thought to myself, quite arrogantly, “One day, I’m going to find out the truth of reality.” Oh, what a naive sweet summer child I was… looking back, perhaps that’s the moment I should have realized that Christianity has something real to say about human nature.

**First Contact**

My first contact with religion was when I was eight years old. There was a friend I played with in the neighborhood and she brought up God one day. I asked, “What’s God?” and she got her family to take me to their non-denominational church for service a few times. I didn’t really get it, but something about it felt right.

That’s why, after we moved to another state when I was 10, I asked my mom if we could go to church like the one my friend had taken me to. She agreed, and we started going to a Baptist megachurch. It was so massive, it was almost like a mall… three sprawling floors, a library, plus a gym with basketball courts. They had separate children’s service and Sunday school on the second floor, but most Sundays I found myself simply walking around the church, not paying attention to anything but my own instinct to wander and explore the huge complex. I believe I did this due to having high-functioning autism and sensory sensitivity, plus severe social anxiety. Still, I was content to simply wander and explore by myself. I even got baptised at 11, although I don’t believe I understood what it meant. When I became 13, though, I was put into a smaller Middle School girls group, and the social anxiety got to me and I told my mom I didn’t want to go anymore, so we didn’t.

After that, I was content to simply explore the paranormal. I would stay up some nights reading ghost stories online, and I even had a few spooky ghost experiences of my own. I found my way to some sites about witchcraft and astral travel and thought it was fascinating, but never did anything with it due to my age.

**Encountering God**

One night when I was 15 years old, I was taking a shower while having some intensely dark, suicidal thoughts (a common occurence for me back then, although the thoughts were especially dark on that night). When I stepped out of the shower and started drying off, I heard an unnatural “HISSSS” sound right in my ear. My blood ran cold, and my first instinct was that it was a demon. I threw on my clothes, ran into my room, and sat down at my desk. I was freaking out, but I remembered this “protection spell” I had read about on some New Age site before. I closed my eyes and started repeating the words “Heaven, Angel, Wings, Light… Heaven, Angel, Wings, Light” over and over in my head for about 1-2 minutes. When I opened my eyes, I wasn’t the same person. I felt this overwhelming presence of pure Love/Light envelop me, and I felt at one with it. All of the dark thoughts disappeared… all fear of any kind disappeared… it eradicated anything that wasn’t love and peace. It felt like my heart was glowing… like everything in me was burning gently with a holy light. It did not say anything to me, nor did I have any visions - I simply was erased of all darkness while I felt one with it, and filled with its essence instead. I heard footsteps and papers being knocked over in the living room, but no one was there. I heard footsteps outside my window, and nothing was there. But I wasn’t bothered anymore. I basked in the light of the presence for about 30 minutes, and then fell asleep. But I was never quite the same afterwards, no matter how far I would fall.

After that point, from the ages of 15-18, I would occasionally, seemingly at random, have brief sensations of feeling the presence, although to a lesser intensity. I developed a complicated dual personality where one side of me was influenced by the presence of light, and the other was the old me of darkness and pain/suffering. These two sides of me were at war and disliked each other. I twisted my interpretation of the Light into my own image… one that condemned suffering and called the darker part of me a demon. My “Light side” also believed that the Will of the Presence was for me to find a soulmate to cure me of my darkness/pain… and sometimes I thought that the Presence itself might even be my soulmate.

And then, when I was 17-18, my life unraveled. It’s a long story in itself, but basically both of my parents died within 6 months of each other and none of my family wanted to help me so I was totally on my own.

(Important to note is that I couldn’t sleep the night that my dad died suddenly… hours before he died, I felt the presence again in the most intensity I had since the original encounter… for hours, I felt it with me, at one with it… and it was only interrupted when I was called into the bedroom because he had died).

I was all alone at that point, not really knowing what to do but just working my little part-time job waiting for my dad’s home to be foreclosed on. But I wasn’t afraid… I felt the presence with me, even in the background. I didn’t explore it too much though, I read one weird New Age-y book but that was it.

**Anti-Theist Arc**

Right when I turned 19, I entered my first serious relationship. (Important to note again that I really idolized an idea of “If I find my soulmate, I’ll be healed from my darkness” and I believed God (the Presence) would support me in this and lead me to my soulmate) Things were good for the first month, and then cracks started to show, more and more, and I ignored them because I was afraid of being alone. My partner was an atheist and had an extremely fundamentalist “Christian” mother (a blatant hypocrite who fell for televangelists). I felt utterly betrayed by God, because I had felt God’s presence after my parents died and believed He was leading me to my soulmate (or to a good situation), only for me to meet and be trapped with someone who was a terrible partner for me. I felt like God “tricked” me or let me down. So I was angry and resentful towards God, both for that and for my parents’ deaths. From the ages of 19-24, I believed God probably existed, and I hated Him for “betraying me.” I even had a period of time where I was practically worshipping my own pain and suffering, and believed that the demons were in the right for turning against God. Eventually I did leave the situation with my first relationship, although it was extremely messy and I ended up homeless briefly… I don’t think I would be alive today if not for divine intervention.

**New Thought Arc / “There is a vague Source”**

After finally getting to a point where I was by myself paying for my own room at 24, I started to feel the yearning to look into “spiritual stuff” again. I fully believed that God had saved me from death given how bad the situation was leaving my ex, and as a result my feelings towards God improved. I started reading New Thought books like Science of Being, A Course in Miracles, and Conversations With God. These books resonated with me for their belief in a personal Source of Existence of which we are all connected to. I started to feel the presence of God again. I even had two vision-like dreams (very unlike the sort of dreams I usually have): one where this tall, featureless, glowing person was holding my hand and the hand of an important friend of mine and walking together with us in the darkness, with us all 3 having scars on our forms. And in another dream, the same featureless, glowing entity was guiding me by the hand towards my friend who was sitting on a throne in a Heavenly landscape like she was playing “princess.” I interpreted the glowing white figure as “God/Source.” During this time, I felt like it was calling me to become its friend, to be in a relationship with it. I wasn’t sure what to do other than to keep reading New Thought books and try to feel its presence.

Although I couldn’t bring myself to believe in the New Thought concept of “Law of Attraction” (you attract good/bad experiences based on your thoughts), I did accept Reincarnation as a fact. I believed that we all have a Higher Self who is already perfect that exists simultaneously along with all incarnations of ourselves across lifetimes/worlds. The purpose of reincarnation is to “learn lessons” and improve ourselves until we merge with the Higher Self who is already merged with God. It’s similar to the Hindu concept of existence as “God Experiencing Itself.”

I even made a 10 hour long visual novel at the time to try and work through my life experiences, and the conclusion was basically “Without evil, there is no good. So embrace the darkness as a necessary part of reality & yourself. Also, just remember that you’re already One with God and everything will be okay.”

After finishing the visual novel, I started dating a guy who I met through sharing it online, and that totally distracted me again from my spiritual seeking (it’s a bad habit). It was another relationship that seemed good at first, but quickly became a mess. It took up the majority of my attention for over a year. And then I eventually ended it.

**The Jewish Arc / Encountering Jesus**

The first book I read about Jesus was written by a Reform Jew who denied everything supernatural about Jesus. In fact, the first sentence of the book is “Many people from traditional Christian backgrounds may find this book shocking and offensive.” Having never heard a halfway decent explanation of the Trinity or Incarnation, my interpretation of what Christians thought Jesus was was “a demigod who God sent to Earth so that God could satisfy his sadistic desire to punish humanity for their sins by taking it out on Jesus instead.” Which to me seemed like pure insanity that wasn’t even worth seriously considering, hence why I hadn’t bothered looking into Christianity (plus I didn’t have a good impression from my first ex’s fundamentalist mother and the prosperity gospel/fake miracle church she had taken us to). But this book “cut through all the bullshit” and got to the core of Jesus’ ethical teachings… and I loved it - I felt drawn to Jesus in a way I never had throughout my entire life. Here was the real Jesus - the misunderstood prophet who people had turned into a weird human sacrificial scapegoat! A man who was at one with his Higher Self… and thus, by extension, God. And my imagination started going wild with my attraction to Jesus… I was imagining myself as his student and what it would be like to live in 1st century Israel with him. I even started making a visual novel about this fantasy. I started feeling absolutely heartbroken and angry at the Crucifixion, as if my best friend & Master/teacher had been killed by humanity. I could barely stand to look at any depictions of it. And I didn’t just feel a friend & teacher bond with this idea of Jesus… it was more than that, too… almost like a lover? I wondered if I was losing my mind and having some kind of psychotic break - as an autistic person, my imagination was prone to running wild and having hyperfixations… but this felt different… this was weird and outside the bounds of what was normal for me.

As I did research for the visual novel about meeting my version of Jesus, I started feeling drawn to Judaism. Something about the music I listened to, the art I saw, the culture and history… it was speaking to me in some strange, familiar way. Plus, it was the religion of Jesus. And I realized “Wait a second… Jews believe in a personal Creator without the weird sadistic human sacrifice stuff! This is perfect!” And so I dived deep into Judaism, started attending Friday evening services at my local Reform congregation, did the candle-lighting ritual on Shabbat, and hung out with Jews on Second Life. I was all-in and convinced I wanted to convert, and started talking to the local Rabbi about it and taking a conversion course over Zoom. But after 2 months, the problems started to appear. First, Reform Judaism doesn’t actually believe in any theology - sure, officially they “believe in God,” but in practice it doesn’t matter and you can believe whatever you want. Second, I realized it wasn’t just Reform… pretty much all Jewish communities outside of Orthodox are like this. Leading to number three, that “being Jewish” is more about cultural/ethnic belonging than religious belief. In fact, religious belief hardly matters for non-Orthodox. For someone whose belief in a personal Creator had become central, this was devastating. I didn’t want to just join a culture/ethnic group (which felt weird), I wanted to be part of a community who actually believed in God and could agree on a few fundamental theological facts. And Orthodox Judaism wasn’t an option - not only because there was no local congregation, but because I found their obsessions over the “617 commandments” to be weird and missing the point. So I gave up on Judaism, and was left with the one single religion that I had intentionally ignored the entire time.

**Eastern Orthodox Arc**

For me at the time, looking into any form of Nicene Christianity was an absolute last resort. It was the LAST religion on Earth that I thought could actually be true. And after New Thought and Judaism failed me, I began with Unitarian Universalism and other forms of Unitarian Christianity. But I quickly realized these weren’t options - the local Unitarian congregation was a New Age-y mess that believed in the Law of Attraction and other such nonsense. Meanwhile, the local Unitarian Universalist church was just preaching leftist politics as religion and didn’t even affirm God on the most basic level. In one last desperate attempt I looked into Baháʼí, but the fact that they put Muhammad on the same level as Jesus and Buddha was laughable to me.

So, as I sat there feeling dejected, like there was no religion left in the world that could even halfway align with what I felt of the Presence… I remembered an Eastern Orthodox man I had met online once, who I had a few interesting conversations with. He seemed to imply that Eastern Orthodoxy had a much more mystical view of Heaven & Hell than other Christians did, and that made me open enough to say “fuck it” and give it a chance. So I started attending the local Greek Orthodox church, made a few acquaintances, and talked to them plus the priest about my experiences and journey. The priest gave me a few books to read, but since they didn’t have a conversion program, I was on my own to study and decide if I wanted to join. So I read *The Orthodox Way* by Kallistos Ware, which is a very mystical-like interpretation of the Trinity. I thought “Okay… this… doesn’t NOT make sense…” and finally started opening up to the possibility that maybe I had never actually encountered real Christianity before… although I was having difficulty aligning the orthodox version of Jesus with my personal experiences of the Presence. The apocalyptic passages and sayings where he puts Israel first really confused me, and I still felt like they might be mistaken about Jesus being literally God instead of a prophet.

Although the EO service and church were beautiful, there just wasn’t much support for converts or any extracurricular activities. Someone tried to run a bible study at their house a few times, but it didn’t stick. To be part of the EO community, you showed up on Sundays, hung out casually at coffee hour afterwards, and that was it. I was really wanting more… I really NEEDED more. Plus, I felt like they were a bit arrogant and exclusive, such as only praying for the souls of EO Christians and no others. So after a few months, I started looking into Catholicism instead.

**Catholic Arc**

Compared to the local EO community, Catholicism in my city was a whole different world. What was lacking in EO was overflowing in Catholicism. With multiple parishes available, there were extracurricular events galore. I started going to a weekly adult social group at one parish, where I met my future sponsor who introduced me to the girl who would become my roommate. I started attending OCIA and getting really excited, thinking I finally found my religion and my community.

…And yet, I really didn’t understand their version of the Eucharist.

…And yet, I really didn’t think missing Mass was a mortal sin.

…And yet, I really didn’t think confessing to a priest was necessary for forgiveness from God.

…And yet, I felt like they were way too scrupulous, obsessed with appearing clean and righteous before God in a performative way.

…And wait a minute, did they just call Mary “Queen of Heaven?” And aren’t a lot of her titles similar to the Mother Goddess archetype of Paganism?

…Also, how did God just arbitrarily make Mary “sinless?” Isn’t that a free-will violation? And how do we know she never sinned? If God wants to enter our world to restore our fallen, sinful nature then why does Mary even NEED to be sinless?

…Also, why are they praying directly to the saints and Mary, as if they have magical powers that can interfere in life?

…Also, why are there 1,000 extra devotions and “acts of piety”? This is very confusing, what about just encountering God?

…Wait, why are we worshipping bread? Why is the entire worship service centered solely on the Eucharist and not praising God directly?

…And you’re telling me I have to assent to every single dogma or I’m not in communion with the one church that supposedly has exclusive means of salvation?

*(I am aware that Catholic theology itself has answers to all of these problems, and Pope Leo even cracked down on some of the Mary language. But in practice, this is still how it comes across to me. Not here to debate with any Catholics, I totally get that the ritual and extra stuff works for many people, it just doesn't do it for me.)*

A month after Confirmation, I already had major doubts. Obsessing over doctrines and rules and ritual had completely overridden my own relationship to God. Even though there was beauty and tradition in Catholicism, the ritual felt lifeless. There were so many moving parts and practices and devotions that it felt like a maze to try to approach God. I had completely lost sight of what actually mattered, and I became disenfranchised and wanted to throw the entire thing out. I still didn’t understand Jesus’ apocalyptic sayings, and I couldn’t in good conscience equate their version of God to my own personal experience. It all felt so performative and tiring, and I only kept trying on-and-off at all because I had a Catholic roommate at the time (and in the end, even she betrayed me and did something very shitty). Even a trip to Israel didn’t save my “faith,” although I did feel God’s presence on Mount Tabor (site of the Transfiguration) and for a brief moment, the Christian idea of Jesus intuitively made sense to me somewhere deep within. But it didn’t last.

**Celtic Pagan Arc (10/2024 - 1/2026)**

I had doubts… an ever-growing number of doubts. Jesus’ teachings didn’t make any sense. Nothing made any sense anymore. And at this point, my doubts weren’t worth working through, because all I had waiting for me was a confusing, convoluted religion that couldn’t even offer me a clear and direct way to access God. In a last-ditch effort to save Christianity, I tried a non-denominational church but found it lukewarm and uninspiring - they were so desperate to be “neutral” that they had nothing real to say at all. So I left it all behind and went back to the ways of my ancestors… at first, I explored Norse Paganism (Heathenry), but then I started dating a Celtic Pagan and adopted his practice. A former Christian and scathing critic of it, he nearly convinced me that the idea of a Personal God was a foolish fantasy that could never explain the presence of Evil in the world. Nevertheless, I continued to believe in a Source even if it were more impersonal (similar to Neoplatonism). Even in my rituals to the gods, I believed they were ultimately servants of and manifestations of Truth.

And yet I could never fully let it go. I kept circling back to Catholicism, like that half-broken childhood toy that no longer works, but you just can’t bring yourself to throw away. I convinced my boyfriend to attend a Catholic service, and for him, it was a total shock that Christianity “could be this beautiful.” Eventually, he started to attend OCIA at his own local parish despite massive theological doubts and started to believe Christianity could be true again. I kept being Pagan, but it felt like something was missing (devotion to the Source). When I was visiting him 2 months ago, he broke up with me… basically we both failed each other in an intense moment when we really needed each other. But my initial reaction was to blame his failure on Catholicism (and Christianity as a whole) and dive even more seriously into Paganism. I was convinced that I would take up the mantle of the Druids, my poor ancestors whose entire culture was destroyed by an invading, imperial religion of Rome. I would be as Boudicca, taking the last stand against those imperial dogs… even if my allies were few, even if we would fall to them.

**??? (January - Now)**

How ironic, I thought, that I ran from Christianity and started dating a Pagan… only to turn him back to Christianity. Somewhere deep down, as it was happening, I knew. I knew that perhaps God had us meet for that purpose. And despite my own theological objections, I allowed it… because the truth is most important, whatever it is. If he was meant to return to Christianity, then he should.

As for me, I realized why I made the mistake that I did when he broke up with me.

I realized why I pushed my roommate to be a shitty person to me to begin with.

Both times, I had given in to anger and pride and snapped at people I cared about.

I realized why, every time I get into a relationship, I get obsessive and lose sight of everything else.

I realized why, when I treat ANYTHING else as the most important thing to me, I lose sight of the Presence.

I realized that whenever I lose sight of God, I always choose the way of death.

And suddenly it all started to make sense.

I opened myself back up to the Presence, calling out and inviting God to be with me again… and I started to feel it once more, the same as it had always been.

The truth was actually very simple.

God is “the way, the truth, and the life” and when we don’t place God above everything else, we lead ourselves to destruction.

God had always been with me in the darkest moments to the point where I had full-on mystical feelings of His presence. And yet I didn’t trust in God, and followed what I thought was best for me… only to fail, every time.

Eventually, when the truth slaps you in your face enough times, you finally get it.

Last Sunday, I went to an Assemblies of God church, and it was a great experience. I normally am iffy about anything even remotely associated with Pentecostalism, but they didn’t seem too crazy. I think a charismatic church is what I need right now to aid me in reconnecting to my relationship to God. As for the future, I don’t know, but I’m going to do my best to put God first above everything and keep it that way.

I still struggle with Jesus’ identity. The New Testament seems to paint a complicated picture across its books… but maybe I’m just dense. I understand it easily when I just let myself feel it, but I get confused when I try to rationalize it. I’ll have to work it out over time, because if I start getting obsessed over doctrines again, it’ll wreck me.

As for the rest of what I’m currently feeling, I can’t put it into words. Instead, I made a 7-song animated music video series that shows my journey from an internal, inner world perspective. It begins with my naive, optimistic search for my soulmate (with clear hints that I’m seeking more than a mere human), a reckoning with my own shadow, my worshipping of my own suffering to survive, coming face-to-face with the void within me, overcoming it by the influence of God, and finally, the last two songs are about my re-discovering God. 

These were made using AI (although it used my own art as reference for the characters) so if you have a problem with that, then don’t watch it. I think AI for personal creative projects is fine, but I’m not here to debate it. Also, scars and blood feature heavily, so that’s your trigger warning.

1qw9qyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianTestimony/comments/1qw9qyq/my_complicated_convoluted_journey_to_christianity/,"My Complicated, Convoluted Journey to Christianity: A Lengthy Memoir","**In The Beginning**

I was seven years old when I watched someone die for the first time. I still remember sitting in the hospital room that night as I played my Game Boy Advance to pass time as the family sat around, watching my grandfather dying of leukemia. The previous day, a minister had come into the room to ask my grandfather if he would accept Jesus so that he could go to Heaven. He accepted, crying, and they prayed together. I don’t know if my grandfather really believed it, or if he was just afraid.

Neither side of my family had been religious in at least 2-3 generations. My mother was a doubtful agnostic who had little to say about religion beyond “this makes people feel better.” My father was a Mormon for a brief period before I was born, but was kicked out of his church (I don’t know why) - after that, he became agnostic and never brought the topic up.

My parents didn’t have anything to say about religion, but they did have a few spooky stories of paranormal encounters with ghosts which fascinated me.

I believe the ghost stories, plus witnessing a death at so young an age, helped ignite the insatiable curiosity I quickly grew to have about existential questions.

I still remember the first time I dared to ask “Why?” - I was sitting in the bathtub at my grandparents house not long after my grandfather passed, surrounded by bubbles and a rubber ducky. I looked up at the ceiling and thought to myself, quite arrogantly, “One day, I’m going to find out the truth of reality.” Oh, what a naive sweet summer child I was… looking back, perhaps that’s the moment I should have realized that Christianity has something real to say about human nature.

**First Contact**

My first contact with religion was when I was eight years old. There was a friend I played with in the neighborhood and she brought up God one day. I asked, “What’s God?” and she got her family to take me to their non-denominational church for service a few times. I didn’t really get it, but something about it felt right.

That’s why, after we moved to another state when I was 10, I asked my mom if we could go to church like the one my friend had taken me to. She agreed, and we started going to a Baptist megachurch. It was so massive, it was almost like a mall… three sprawling floors, a library, plus a gym with basketball courts. They had separate children’s service and Sunday school on the second floor, but most Sundays I found myself simply walking around the church, not paying attention to anything but my own instinct to wander and explore the huge complex. I believe I did this due to having high-functioning autism and sensory sensitivity, plus severe social anxiety. Still, I was content to simply wander and explore by myself. I even got baptised at 11, although I don’t believe I understood what it meant. When I became 13, though, I was put into a smaller Middle School girls group, and the social anxiety got to me and I told my mom I didn’t want to go anymore, so we didn’t.

After that, I was content to simply explore the paranormal. I would stay up some nights reading ghost stories online, and I even had a few spooky ghost experiences of my own. I found my way to some sites about witchcraft and astral travel and thought it was fascinating, but never did anything with it due to my age.

**Encountering God**

One night when I was 15 years old, I was taking a shower while having some intensely dark, suicidal thoughts (a common occurence for me back then, although the thoughts were especially dark on that night). When I stepped out of the shower and started drying off, I heard an unnatural “HISSSS” sound right in my ear. My blood ran cold, and my first instinct was that it was a demon. I threw on my clothes, ran into my room, and sat down at my desk. I was freaking out, but I remembered this “protection spell” I had read about on some New Age site before. I closed my eyes and started repeating the words “Heaven, Angel, Wings, Light… Heaven, Angel, Wings, Light” over and over in my head for about 1-2 minutes. When I opened my eyes, I wasn’t the same person. I felt this overwhelming presence of pure Love/Light envelop me, and I felt at one with it. All of the dark thoughts disappeared… all fear of any kind disappeared… it eradicated anything that wasn’t love and peace. It felt like my heart was glowing… like everything in me was burning gently with a holy light. It did not say anything to me, nor did I have any visions - I simply was erased of all darkness while I felt one with it, and filled with its essence instead. I heard footsteps and papers being knocked over in the living room, but no one was there. I heard footsteps outside my window, and nothing was there. But I wasn’t bothered anymore. I basked in the light of the presence for about 30 minutes, and then fell asleep. But I was never quite the same afterwards, no matter how far I would fall.

After that point, from the ages of 15-18, I would occasionally, seemingly at random, have brief sensations of feeling the presence, although to a lesser intensity. I developed a complicated dual personality where one side of me was influenced by the presence of light, and the other was the old me of darkness and pain/suffering. These two sides of me were at war and disliked each other. I twisted my interpretation of the Light into my own image… one that condemned suffering and called the darker part of me a demon. My “Light side” also believed that the Will of the Presence was for me to find a soulmate to cure me of my darkness/pain… and sometimes I thought that the Presence itself might even be my soulmate.

And then, when I was 17-18, my life unraveled. It’s a long story in itself, but basically both of my parents died within 6 months of each other and none of my family wanted to help me so I was totally on my own.

(Important to note is that I couldn’t sleep the night that my dad died suddenly… hours before he died, I felt the presence again in the most intensity I had since the original encounter… for hours, I felt it with me, at one with it… and it was only interrupted when I was called into the bedroom because he had died).

I was all alone at that point, not really knowing what to do but just working my little part-time job waiting for my dad’s home to be foreclosed on. But I wasn’t afraid… I felt the presence with me, even in the background. I didn’t explore it too much though, I read one weird New Age-y book but that was it.

**Anti-Theist Arc**

Right when I turned 19, I entered my first serious relationship. (Important to note again that I really idolized an idea of “If I find my soulmate, I’ll be healed from my darkness” and I believed God (the Presence) would support me in this and lead me to my soulmate) Things were good for the first month, and then cracks started to show, more and more, and I ignored them because I was afraid of being alone. My partner was an atheist and had an extremely fundamentalist “Christian” mother (a blatant hypocrite who fell for televangelists). I felt utterly betrayed by God, because I had felt God’s presence after my parents died and believed He was leading me to my soulmate (or to a good situation), only for me to meet and be trapped with someone who was a terrible partner for me. I felt like God “tricked” me or let me down. So I was angry and resentful towards God, both for that and for my parents’ deaths. From the ages of 19-24, I believed God probably existed, and I hated Him for “betraying me.” I even had a period of time where I was practically worshipping my own pain and suffering, and believed that the demons were in the right for turning against God. Eventually I did leave the situation with my first relationship, although it was extremely messy and I ended up homeless briefly… I don’t think I would be alive today if not for divine intervention.

**New Thought Arc / “There is a vague Source”**

After finally getting to a point where I was by myself paying for my own room at 24, I started to feel the yearning to look into “spiritual stuff” again. I fully believed that God had saved me from death given how bad the situation was leaving my ex, and as a result my feelings towards God improved. I started reading New Thought books like Science of Being, A Course in Miracles, and Conversations With God. These books resonated with me for their belief in a personal Source of Existence of which we are all connected to. I started to feel the presence of God again. I even had two vision-like dreams (very unlike the sort of dreams I usually have): one where this tall, featureless, glowing person was holding my hand and the hand of an important friend of mine and walking together with us in the darkness, with us all 3 having scars on our forms. And in another dream, the same featureless, glowing entity was guiding me by the hand towards my friend who was sitting on a throne in a Heavenly landscape like she was playing “princess.” I interpreted the glowing white figure as “God/Source.” During this time, I felt like it was calling me to become its friend, to be in a relationship with it. I wasn’t sure what to do other than to keep reading New Thought books and try to feel its presence.

Although I couldn’t bring myself to believe in the New Thought concept of “Law of Attraction” (you attract good/bad experiences based on your thoughts), I did accept Reincarnation as a fact. I believed that we all have a Higher Self who is already perfect that exists simultaneously along with all incarnations of ourselves across lifetimes/worlds. The purpose of reincarnation is to “learn lessons” and improve ourselves until we merge with the Higher Self who is already merged with God. It’s similar to the Hindu concept of existence as “God Experiencing Itself.”

I even made a 10 hour long visual novel at the time to try and work through my life experiences, and the conclusion was basically “Without evil, there is no good. So embrace the darkness as a necessary part of reality & yourself. Also, just remember that you’re already One with God and everything will be okay.”

After finishing the visual novel, I started dating a guy who I met through sharing it online, and that totally distracted me again from my spiritual seeking (it’s a bad habit). It was another relationship that seemed good at first, but quickly became a mess. It took up the majority of my attention for over a year. And then I eventually ended it.

**The Jewish Arc / Encountering Jesus**

The first book I read about Jesus was written by a Reform Jew who denied everything supernatural about Jesus. In fact, the first sentence of the book is “Many people from traditional Christian backgrounds may find this book shocking and offensive.” Having never heard a halfway decent explanation of the Trinity or Incarnation, my interpretation of what Christians thought Jesus was was “a demigod who God sent to Earth so that God could satisfy his sadistic desire to punish humanity for their sins by taking it out on Jesus instead.” Which to me seemed like pure insanity that wasn’t even worth seriously considering, hence why I hadn’t bothered looking into Christianity (plus I didn’t have a good impression from my first ex’s fundamentalist mother and the prosperity gospel/fake miracle church she had taken us to). But this book “cut through all the bullshit” and got to the core of Jesus’ ethical teachings… and I loved it - I felt drawn to Jesus in a way I never had throughout my entire life. Here was the real Jesus - the misunderstood prophet who people had turned into a weird human sacrificial scapegoat! A man who was at one with his Higher Self… and thus, by extension, God. And my imagination started going wild with my attraction to Jesus… I was imagining myself as his student and what it would be like to live in 1st century Israel with him. I even started making a visual novel about this fantasy. I started feeling absolutely heartbroken and angry at the Crucifixion, as if my best friend & Master/teacher had been killed by humanity. I could barely stand to look at any depictions of it. And I didn’t just feel a friend & teacher bond with this idea of Jesus… it was more than that, too… almost like a lover? I wondered if I was losing my mind and having some kind of psychotic break - as an autistic person, my imagination was prone to running wild and having hyperfixations… but this felt different… this was weird and outside the bounds of what was normal for me.

As I did research for the visual novel about meeting my version of Jesus, I started feeling drawn to Judaism. Something about the music I listened to, the art I saw, the culture and history… it was speaking to me in some strange, familiar way. Plus, it was the religion of Jesus. And I realized “Wait a second… Jews believe in a personal Creator without the weird sadistic human sacrifice stuff! This is perfect!” And so I dived deep into Judaism, started attending Friday evening services at my local Reform congregation, did the candle-lighting ritual on Shabbat, and hung out with Jews on Second Life. I was all-in and convinced I wanted to convert, and started talking to the local Rabbi about it and taking a conversion course over Zoom. But after 2 months, the problems started to appear. First, Reform Judaism doesn’t actually believe in any theology - sure, officially they “believe in God,” but in practice it doesn’t matter and you can believe whatever you want.

…Also, why are they praying directly to the saints and Mary, as if they have magical powers that can interfere in life?

…Also, why are there 1,000 extra devotions and “acts of piety”? This is very confusing, what about just encountering God?

…Wait, why are we worshipping bread? Why is the entire worship service centered solely on the Eucharist and not praising God directly?

…And you’re telling me I have to assent to every single dogma or I’m not in communion with the one church that supposedly has exclusive means of salvation?

*(I am aware that Catholic theology itself has answers to all of these problems, and Pope Leo even cracked down on some of the Mary language. But in practice, this is still how it comes across to me. Not here to debate with any Catholics, I totally get that the ritual and extra stuff works for many people, it just doesn't do it for me.)*

A month after Confirmation, I already had major doubts. Obsessing over doctrines and rules and ritual had completely overridden my own relationship to God. Even though there was beauty and tradition in Catholicism, the ritual felt lifeless. There were so many moving parts and practices and devotions that it felt like a maze to try to approach God. I had completely lost sight of what actually mattered, and I became disenfranchised and wanted to throw the entire thing out. I still didn’t understand Jesus’ apocalyptic sayings, and I couldn’t in good conscience equate their version of God to my own personal experience. It all felt so performative and tiring, and I only kept trying on-and-off at all because I had a Catholic roommate at the time (and in the end, even she betrayed me and did something very shitty). Even a trip to Israel didn’t save my “faith,” although I did feel God’s presence on Mount Tabor (site of the Transfiguration) and for a brief moment, the Christian idea of Jesus intuitively made sense to me somewhere deep within. But it didn’t last.

**Celtic Pagan Arc (10/2024 - 1/2026)**

I had doubts… an ever-growing number of doubts. Jesus’ teachings didn’t make any sense. Nothing made any sense anymore. And at this point, my doubts weren’t worth working through, because all I had waiting for me was a confusing, convoluted religion that couldn’t even offer me a clear and direct way to access God. In a last-ditch effort to save Christianity, I tried a non-denominational church but found it lukewarm and uninspiring - they were so desperate to be “neutral” that they had nothing real to say at all. So I left it all behind and went back to the ways of my ancestors… at first, I explored Norse Paganism (Heathenry), but then I started dating a Celtic Pagan and adopted his practice. A former Christian and scathing critic of it, he nearly convinced me that the idea of a Personal God was a foolish fantasy that could never explain the presence of Evil in the world. Nevertheless, I continued to believe in a Source even if it were more impersonal (similar to Neoplatonism). Even in my rituals to the gods, I believed they were ultimately servants of and manifestations of Truth.

And yet I could never fully let it go. I kept circling back to Catholicism, like that half-broken childhood toy that no longer works, but you just can’t bring yourself to throw away. I convinced my boyfriend to attend a Catholic service, and for him, it was a total shock that Christianity “could be this beautiful.” Eventually, he started to attend OCIA at his own local parish despite massive theological doubts and started to believe Christianity could be true again. I kept being Pagan, but it felt like something was missing (devotion to the Source). When I was visiting him 2 months ago, he broke up with me… basically we both failed each other in an intense moment when we really needed each other. But my initial reaction was to blame his failure on Catholicism (and Christianity as a whole) and dive even more seriously into Paganism. I was convinced that I would take up the mantle of the Druids, my poor ancestors whose entire culture was destroyed by an invading, imperial religion of Rome. I would be as Boudicca, taking the last stand against those imperial dogs… even if my allies were few, even if we would fall to them.

**??? (January - Now)**

How ironic, I thought, that I ran from Christianity and started dating a Pagan… only to turn him back to Christianity. Somewhere deep down, as it was happening, I knew. I knew that perhaps God had us meet for that purpose. And despite my own theological objections, I allowed it… because the truth is most important, whatever it is. If he was meant to return to Christianity, then he should.

As for me, I realized why I made the mistake that I did when he broke up with me.

I realized why I pushed my roommate to be a shitty person to me to begin with.

Both times, I had given in to anger and pride and snapped at people I cared about.

I realized why, every time I get into a relationship, I get obsessive and lose sight of everything else.

I realized why, when I treat ANYTHING else as the most important thing to me, I lose sight of the Presence.

I realized that whenever I lose sight of God, I always choose the way of death.

And suddenly it all started to make sense.

I opened myself back up to the Presence, calling out and inviting God to be with me again… and I started to feel it once more, the same as it had always been.

The truth was actually very simple.

God is “the way, the truth, and the life” and when we don’t place God above everything else, we lead ourselves to destruction.

God had always been with me in the darkest moments to the point where I had full-on mystical feelings of His presence. And yet I didn’t trust in God, and followed what I thought was best for me… only to fail, every time.

Eventually, when the truth slaps you in your face enough times, you finally get it.

Last Sunday, I went to an Assemblies of God church, and it was a great experience. I normally am iffy about anything even remotely associated with Pentecostalism, but they didn’t seem too crazy. I think a charismatic church is what I need right now to aid me in reconnecting to my relationship to God. As for the future, I don’t know, but I’m going to do my best to put God first above everything and keep it that way.

I still struggle with Jesus’ identity. The New Testament seems to paint a complicated picture across its books… but maybe I’m just dense. I understand it easily when I just let myself feel it, but I get confused when I try to rationalize it. I’ll have to work it out over time, because if I start getting obsessed over doctrines again, it’ll wreck me.

As for the rest of what I’m currently feeling, I can’t put it into words. Instead, I made a 7-song animated music video series that shows my journey from an internal, inner world perspective. It begins with my naive, optimistic search for my soulmate (with clear hints that I’m seeking more than a mere human), a reckoning with my own shadow, my worshipping of my own suffering to survive, coming face-to-face with the void within me, overcoming it by the influence of God, and finally, the last two songs are about my re-discovering God. 

These were made using AI (although it used my own art as reference for the characters) so if you have a problem with that, then don’t watch it. I think AI for personal creative projects is fine, but I’m not here to debate it. Also, scars and blood feature heavily, so that’s your trigger warning.

I’m also into sneakers, cooking, and F1.

1qw9pfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/paralegal/comments/1qw9pfz/am_i_paranoid_or_am_i_being_set_up_for_failure/,Am I Paranoid or am I being set up for failure?,"Hello! I’m actually a legal assistant working on finishing my paralegal certificate this year. I’ve actually only been a legal assistant at this small firm for 3 months. There’s only 2 paralegals who work hybrid remote, and 2 attorneys who work full time in office. I work in office full time. 

It’s been pretty standard so far nothing too crazy in terms of the work I’m doing or what’s expected of me. I take care of potential new client intake, pick up the phone, schedule calls and conferences, write emails, organize files, etc.  

Yesterday, I was pulled into a 2 hour meeting with the Sr. Paralegal and told I’m approved to start charging billable hours. Cool right? EXCEPT-that’s not what’s happening. 

As the meeting progresses, she explained as a legal assistant I don’t actually really have a billable rate, and I can’t bill actually for most client work as a lot of what I’m doing is potential new client intake. While some of that makes sense, I’m like why did you lead in with this as if you were going to pay me more when you’re not? Lol. Instead, I’m being expected to “bill” a timeline of everything I do in the firm throughout the day. Not just for clients, I have a fake admin account to “bill” myself and record what tasks I’m doing throughout the day like refilling the coffee pot in the office kitchen, or organizing my desk. 

I know that billing is a crucial and normal part of working in a law firm. I guess since I was told I’d get paid more, and then told that actually I wouldn’t qualify for that yet, this feels less like practicing billable hours, or a cool opportunity, and feels more like they don’t trust me or the work I’ve been doing? Im also confused because I’m an hourly employee and use a timesheet to clock in/out/take unpaid lunch, etc. So now that I’m also expected to take extra notes of everything I’m doing and how long for menial daily tasks I initially feel like they gave me more work to do. However, I can also understand that I may have taken this the wrong way. This may be a really standard practice and should I get to become a paralegal this would allow me to know HOW to bill hours correctly I guess. 

So I’m curious what people think. Does this sound normal and I’m paranoid or ungrateful? Or does it sound maybe like the firm is making me do extra work to prove I’m doing things for non-billable clients/admin duties because they don’t trust that I’m doing that menial work? 

NOTE: I did ask if they had feedback for me in the meeting regarding work and quality of work so far. I was told I had not done anything to make them distrust me. I was told they were pleased with the quality and quantity of work so far. However it all feels weird especially with how hthis was originally pitched to me.

I’m a 33M first-year MBA student in the U.S. Last year during interview prep, a 32F Korean international student (an alum who was about to graduate when I started) helped me with a mock interview through our business school ambassador program. She was very kind and generous with her time. After I joined, I sent a thank-you message and we exchanged a polite follow-up. Nothing flirty, just respectful. 

Over time, I realized I’m genuinely interested in her. We’re around the same age (I’m probably a year older). I do find her attractive and I’ve always been drawn to Asian women, but what stands out more to me is her personality and kindness. That’s what makes me consider reaching out.

My hesitation is the context. She was technically my senior in the program and I don’t want to cross any professional or school-related boundaries or make her uncomfortable. She has already graduated, and if I reached out it would only be to ask for a simple, low-pressure coffee. I’m also slightly worried about reputational risk within the business school community if it’s received poorly.

I’m trying to figure out the most respectful and appropriate way to handle this.

What would be the best way to reach out (or not reach out) so that I’m being considerate of boundaries, her comfort, and the prior professional context?

TL;DR:
33M MBA student interested in 32F alum who helped me a year ago. Haven’t talked since. Want to ask for a low-pressure coffee but don’t want to make her uncomfortable or create awkwardness.

I still spend a lot of my week in the trenches running my spots over in New Jersey, but now that I’m based back home, I’m looking to connect with the local business community here in the Lehigh Valley.

Running high-volume restaurants has taught me that most owners are so busy in the business that they don’t have time to work on the business. I’ve seen how much money gets left on the table due to unoptimized menus, outdated web design, or food photography that doesn’t do the kitchen justice.

Since I’m splitting my time between NJ and PA, I’m opening the door for consulting, marketing, and creative work right here in Easton. Whether it’s fixing a menu to boost margins, building a website that actually converts, or even just talking shop about pizza-making and marketing, I’d love to be a resource for the small business owners in this town.

I really like this combo of instant coffee and all milk. I tried to make cafe au lait / latte type coffee drinks in a variety of methods and proportions, but can't seem to produce something that gets the same (or close enough) flavor.

Maybe it's a dumb goal, but now I am curious. Have you found anything that tastes like that, with just fresh coffee beans?

I spent a period of time drinking alcohol heavily, mainly straight vodka. I stopped drinking. I drank coffee one morning and my two front teeth and the ones next to them (four total) were stained completely black.
Brushing my teeth did absolutely nothing so I did a rinse with peroxide and water. This definitely made things better but the remaining stains will not go away. I tried putting peroxide on a q-tip and applying it directly but this also did nothing. I tried brushing with a baking soda and peroxide paste once a week and also nothing.
What on earth have I done to my teeth and is this fixable? It's embarrassing, mostly because I don't know what to tell people and that makes it sound like I'm lying! ""Oh yeah right coffee did that"". No, it was coffee alright. I noticed it immediately like, WAIT WHY ARE MY TEETH BLACK?

1qw9ewf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qw9ewf/how_to_stop_being_socially_awkward_the_psychology/,How to Stop Being Socially Awkward: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Look, if you are reading this, you've probably walked away from conversations replaying every word you said, wondering why you're so weird. You have probably stood at parties not knowing what to do with your hands. You've probably sent texts and immediately regretted them. I get it. Social awkwardness isn't just ""being shy."" It's this weird prison where you're hyperaware of everything you do, and that awareness makes everything worse.

Here's what most people don't tell you: Social awkwardness isn't some permanent character flaw. It's a skill deficit mixed with anxiety, overthinking, and sometimes past experiences that taught your brain to freak out in social situations. The good news? Skills can be learned. Your brain can be rewired. d. Let's get into it.

**Step 1: Stop Treating Social Situations Like Performance Reviews**

Your first problem is you think every interaction is a test you can fail. Spoiler alert: It's not. Most people are too worried about themselves to judge you as harshly as you think. They're not sitting there grading your conversational skills.

Reframe how you think about socializing. It's not about being impressive or perfect. It's about connection. Even messy, awkward connections count. When you stop trying to perform and start trying to genuinely engage, the pressure drops.

Research from Stanford psychologist Kelly McGonigal shows that viewing social anxiety as excitement rather than fear actually improves performance. Your body's stress response is the same for both emotions. Tell yourself, ""I'm excited"" instead of ""I'm nervous."" Sounds dumb. Works anyway.

**Step 2: Master the Art of Asking Questions (The Cheat Code)**

Here's your secret weapon: People love talking about themselves. If you don't know what to say, ask questions. Not interview-style interrogations, but genuine curiosity.

Instead of panicking about what clever thing to say next, focus on learning something about the other person. Ask follow-up questions. ""What made you interested in that?"" ""How'd you get into that?"" ""What's that like?""

The book ""[How to Talk to Anyone](https://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Anyone-Success-Relationships/dp/007141858X)"" by Leil Lowndes breaks down 92 specific techniques for conversations. One killer tip: the ""hook and reveal"" method. You drop a small piece of interesting information about yourself, then ask them a related question. ""I just started learning guitar, and it's kicking my ass. Do you play any instruments? ""Boom. You've created a natural back-and-forth.

**Step 3: Practice Active Listening Like Your Life Depends On It**

Most socially awkward people are so stuck in their heads that they're not actually listening. They're planning their next sentence, worrying about how they look, or replaying what they just said.

Active listening means you're fully present. Make eye contact (not staring, just normal human eye contact). Nod. React with facial expressions. Repeat back what they said in your own words. ""So you're saying your boss is basically a nightmare?"" This shows you're engaged and buys you time to think.

If you want to go deeper but don't have time to read through dozens of social psychology books and research papers, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) is an AI-powered audio learning app that pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, plus expert interviews and studies on social dynamics, communication, and psychology. 

You type in your specific goal, like ""I'm an introvert who freezes in group conversations and wants practical strategies to feel more natural,"" and it builds a personalized learning plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The content quality is solid since everything goes through fact-checking, and you can adjust the voice to whatever keeps you engaged. It's useful for making this kind of self-improvement feel less like work and more like something that actually sticks.

**Step 4: Get Comfortable With Silence (It's Not the Enemy)**

Awkward silence. The thing you fear most. Here's the truth: Brief pauses in conversation are normal. Not every second needs to be filled with noise. The problem is you panic during silence and either say something random or get visibly uncomfortable, which makes it actually awkward.

When there's a pause, take a breath. Look around. Comment on something in your environment. ""This coffee is actually pretty good,"" or ""How do you know the host?"" These simple observations can restart conversation naturally.

**Step 5: Stop Apologizing for Existing**

Do you say ""sorry"" a lot? For taking up space, for talking, for asking questions, for basically being alive? Yeah, cut that out. Constant apologizing signals to others (and yourself) that you're doing something wrong just by participating.

Replace apologies with neutral statements. Instead of ""Sorry, I'm rambling,"" try ""Anyway, what do you think?"" Instead of ""Sorry for bothering you,"" just start with your question. You're not a burden. You're a human having a conversation.

Dr. Aziz Gazipura's ""Not Nice"" destroys the people-pleasing, over-apologizing mindset that keeps you trapped in social anxiety. This book will genuinely make you angry at how much you've been shrinking yourself. It's packed with exercises to build genuine confidence, not fake it till you make it BS.

**Step 6: Embrace Being Slightly Weird (It's Actually Endearing)**

Plot twist: A little awkwardness is humanizing. When you try to be perfectly smooth, you come across as fake or a tryhard. When you acknowledge awkward moments with humor, people relax around you.

Said something weird? Own it. ""Well, that came out wrong"" with a laugh is way better than pretending it didn't happen. Dropped something? Make a joke about your coordination. The goal isn't perfection. It's authenticity.

Research from Stanford shows that people who embrace vulnerability are perceived as more likeable and trustworthy. Your awkwardness might actually be your superpower if you stop fighting it.

**Step 7: Exposure Therapy (Do the Scary Thing)**

You can't think your way out of social awkwardness. You have to practice being social. Start small. Say hi to a barista. Make small talk with a cashier. Comment in a group chat. Gradually work up to bigger interactions.

The more you expose yourself to social situations, the more your brain learns they're not dangerous. It's like building a muscle. It sucks at first, but it gets easier.

Use the app [Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) to track your social exposures as daily goals. Gamifying the process makes it less terrifying and gives you visible progress.

**Step 8: Learn Body Language Basics**

A huge part of social awkwardness is not knowing what to do with your body. Stand up straight (not stiff, just not slouched). Keep your arms uncrossed. Face people when talking to them. Mirror their energy level slightly.

YouTube channel Charisma on Command breaks down body language and social dynamics using examples from movies, interviews, and real interactions. Watch their videos on confidence and conversation skills. This stuff is stupidly practical.

**Step 9: Prepare Conversation Starters and Exit Strategies**

Going into social situations with zero plan is setting yourself up to freeze. Have a mental list of go-to topics: recent shows you've watched, interesting articles you've read, upcoming plans, and hobbies.

Also, know how to exit conversations gracefully. ""I'm going to grab another drink, but it was great talking to you,"" or ""I should say hi to a few other people; catch you later."" ""You're not trapped forever.

**Step 10: Stop Ruminating After Every Interaction**

The conversation is over. Stop replaying it in your head like it's evidence in a trial. That weird thing you said? They forgot about it five seconds later. Your brain is lying to you about how much people care.

When you catch yourself ruminating, physically interrupt the thought. Say ""stop"" out loud if you're alone. Write down the thought and then write a more realistic interpretation. ""They probably think I'm an idiot"" becomes ""They were probably too focused on their own stuff to even notice.""

The book ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns teaches cognitive behavioral techniques to challenge anxious thoughts. It's the gold standard for rewiring negative thinking patterns. Use the exercises. They work.

**The Bottom Line**

Social awkwardness isn't who you are. It's a pattern you learned, and patterns can change. The key is action, not perfection. Have awkward conversations. Mess up. Try again. Your brain will eventually catch on that social situations aren't life or death.

Stop waiting to feel confident before you act. Act, and confidence will follow. Get out there and be your weird, imperfect, human self. That's actually what people want anyway.",1,1770259896.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qw9b9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CostaRicaTravel/comments/1qw9b9s/honest_food_reviews_from_la_fortuna/,Honest food reviews from La Fortuna,"Some context:

I’m leaving LF in the AM for MA after staying here for 5 nights, we’re visiting from NYC and we’re \~30. We borrowed a car from Alamo and drove in from Liberia, we stayed in an Airbnb in El Castillo which was like a 30 min drive into LF proper, feel free to ask any questions!

Top 3 meals:

Jalapas, Jungle Love Lounge, Soda La Hormiga

HM: Don Rufino, good but not worth the price imo

Bottom 3 meals:

Snapper house, Soda La Palma, el Patio Al Carbon

This is a quick recap of all of our meals

Restaurante el Patio Al Carbon - would not recommend, felt like a tourist trap and was overpriced. $40 for a drink, guac, and fajitas

La Mesa De Mama - would recommend if you’re in the area but not worth driving out to! Very home-y, Casado was great and prices were very reasonable! About $40 for 2 entrees, appetizer and 2 cokes

Sloffee - highly recommend, our most visited coffee shop of the trip where we enjoyed lattes, drip, and pastries. Skip the croissants though, their banana bread is delicious - pricey, but worth it. $12 for 2 coffees…

Rainforest Cafe - would recommend for breakfast, reasonably priced. Everything on the Casado was delicious and the fruit plate was delicious. $20 for 2 entrees and a batida 

Snapper House - worst meal I’ve had in awhile, $90 for an appetizer and two entrees and none of it was good. The ceviche tasted like shrimp sitting in water, fried snapper lacked seasoning, wouldn’t recommend

Soda La Hormiga - highly recommended for a reason, their beef sandwich was small but good and their arroz con pollo hit the spot. $20 for a drink and 2 entrees

Jalapas - best meal of the trip with a great view, chifrijo was seasoned so well and the avocado helps balance everything out + coconut shrimp was cooked wonderfully and the sauce was addicting. $110 for 2 entrees, appetizer, and 2 drinks 

Soda Viquez - also highly recommended and reasonably priced but maybe we didn’t order the right things. $20 for a drink and 2 entrees

Jungle Love Lounge - one of the best experiences of our trip and worth making the drive for, it felt like a private chef experience as Kelli explained to us the menu and cooked for us. She also has the best view that we had all week, we had sea bass and shrimp, salad apps, a drink each and dessert and came out to $140

Pincho/empanada tent on the primary road - you’ll see him as you drive into LF, $7 for a pincho, empanada, and a drink felt like a steal and the empanada might’ve been the best of the trip so far 

Pincho food truck in Central Park - this man’s elote was so good, worth the heart burn from the chamoy, tajin, and nacho cheese. Well worth the $5 imo, empanadas are worth skipping though 

Chocolate Fusión - skippable imo, idk why it has such high reviews. 70% hot chocolate didn’t have enough chocolate flavor, the chocolates were just fine

Pops - chocolate mint ice cream was good, pineapple sorbet was a big skip. Decently priced though, $2 for a small scoop

Soda La Palma - pretty disappointing imo, so many better Casados for breakfast although the pork + beans empanada was good the chicken one was pretty dry

Don Rufino - last dinner of the trip and it was highly rated and I think it’s worth going to if you’re looking for a fancy meal. Octopus tamales were a miss, steak was salted well although a tad undercooked it was a quality piece of meat, and the garlic shrimp was good but not worth $40+. Best part of the meal was desserts imo, the flan was delicious but our favorite was the crème brulee cake - $180 for all that + 2 drinks

This sub has been so helpful leading up to our trip and has lead us to so many delicious meals. I thought this might be useful for others who are visiting and are looking for another opinion on where to eat, again also happy to answer any questions!",13,1770259622.0,CostaRicaTravel,3,0.88,False

He was kind and approachable, and although he seemed a bit rusty and off at times, he shared a few helpful pointers and talked about having skated from a young age. We chatted for a while and ended up getting him a coffee before parting ways.

He mentioned that he’s recently out of rehab and trying to improve his situation. We’d already been considering finding someone to help us learn some skate tricks, so we floated the idea of paying him to help us practice sometime. We exchanged numbers, and he gave us a point of contact to reach him.

I genuinely want to be supportive, but I’m also mindful of not crossing into enabling or creating unintended harm.

1qw98e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1qw98e4/how_to_know_theyre_not_into_you_the_psychology/,How to Know They're NOT Into You: The Psychology Behind Mixed Signals (+ Moving On Without Being Weird),"Look, I spent way too much time analyzing mixed signals, reading into texts, and convincing myself that ""maybe they're just busy"" when the truth was staring me in the face. After going down the rabbit hole of psychology research, dating podcasts, and way too many YouTube videos on attachment theory, I realized most of us miss the obvious signs because we don't want to see them.

Here's the uncomfortable truth backed by behavioral science: Your brain is wired to see what it wants to see. It's called confirmation bias, and it's why you'll convince yourself that their one-word reply means they're ""mysterious"" instead of disinterested. The good news? Once you learn to spot these patterns, you save yourself months of mental torture.

So here are the 12 signs that scream ""they're not into you"" that I wish someone had told me years ago.

# 1. Their texting energy is dead

You send paragraphs. They send ""lol"" or ""yeah."" You're putting in effort, and they're giving you the bare minimum. Esther Perel, the world-renowned psychotherapist and author of ""[Mating in Captivity](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Mating_in_Captivity.html?id=Veaw6UQsczUC&redir_esc=y)"", talks about how interest shows up in communication. When someone's attracted to you, they match your energy or exceed it. They ask questions. They engage. They don't leave you on read for days.

If their texts feel like pulling teeth, that's your answer.

# 2. They talk about other people they're into

This one's brutal but clear. If they're comfortable telling you about their crushes, dates, or hookups, you're in the friend zone. Period. People who see you romantically don't casually mention other romantic interests unless they're trying to make you jealous, which is its own red flag.

Research from social psychology shows that when we're attracted to someone, we subconsciously create an ""exclusive bubble"" around that person. We don't pollute that space with other romantic possibilities.

# 3. They never initiate plans

You're always the one reaching out. You're always suggesting hangouts. They say yes sometimes, but they never text first to make plans. Matthew Hussey, dating coach and author of ""[Get The Guy](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wQAFm57ecF0C&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=1)"", breaks this down perfectly. If someone wants to see you, they'll make it happen. They won't make you do all the work.

Stop being the only person keeping this thing alive. Let it breathe. If it dies, it was already dead.

# 4. Physical touch is nonexistent

Humans are tactile creatures. When we're attracted to someone, we find reasons to touch them. A hand on the arm. Sitting close. Playful shoves. If they're keeping physical distance like you've got a contagious disease, they're not feeling it.

A study published in the journal ""Archives of Sexual Behavior"" found that physical touch is one of the earliest indicators of romantic interest. No touch equals no interest.

# 5. They friend-zone you verbally

""You're like a brother/sister to me."" ""I'm so glad we're friends."" ""You're such a good friend."" When someone keeps emphasizing the friend label, believe them. They're not playing hard to get. They're drawing a boundary.

# 6. Your gut knows something's off

Your intuition is smarter than you think. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk's book ""[The Body Keeps the Score](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Body_Keeps_the_Score.html?id=3Q3UAgAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y)"" explains how your nervous system picks up on subtle cues before your conscious mind does. If something feels off, if you constantly feel anxious or confused about where you stand, that's information. Trust it.

# 7. They don't remember things you tell them

When someone's into you, they remember details. Your favorite coffee order. That story about your childhood dog. The project you're stressed about. If they keep forgetting basic things you've mentioned multiple times, it means they're not paying attention because they're not invested.

# 8. They keep conversations surface-level

No deep talks. No vulnerability. No real curiosity about your life, your thoughts, your feelings. Just surface-level chitchat that could apply to anyone.

If they're not trying to go deeper with you, they don't want that kind of connection.

# 9. They cancel plans consistently

Once or twice? Life happens. But if canceling becomes a pattern, that's a choice. People make time for what matters to them. Greg McKeown's ""Essentialism"" has this concept that applies here. People say yes to things that align with their priorities. If you're constantly getting canceled on, you're not a priority.

# 10. Their body language is closed off

Arms crossed. Leaning away. Phone out. Looking around the room. These are all signs of disinterest. Psychologist Amy Cuddy's research on body language shows that when we're attracted to someone, we subconsciously orient our bodies toward them, make eye contact, and mirror their movements. If their body is telling you to back off, listen to it.

# 11. They don't include you in their future

They talk about future plans, trips, events, but you're never part of that picture. ""I'm thinking about moving to New York next year."" Cool, but they're not asking if you'd ever consider it too. When someone sees potential with you, they naturally start imagining you in their future, even casually.

# 12. You feel like you're auditioning

This is the big one. If every interaction feels like you're trying to prove your worth, win them over, or convince them to like you, stop. Attraction shouldn't feel like a job interview. The right person won't make you jump through hoops.

""[Attached](https://books.google.com.pa/books?id=esohkgEACAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s)"" by Dr. Amir Levine is insanely good on this. It breaks down attachment styles and why anxious attachment makes us chase people who aren't available. The book completely changed how I view relationships. If you're constantly feeling anxious about someone's feelings toward you, that's not love. That's your nervous system screaming that something's wrong.

# What to do with this information

First, stop torturing yourself with ""what ifs."" The signs are there. You're just choosing not to see them because rejection hurts. But you know what hurts more? Wasting months or years on someone who was never going to reciprocate.

Second, redirect that energy. Use an app like Finch to build habits that actually serve you. Work on yourself. Hit the gym. Read. Develop skills. The best revenge against unrequited feelings is becoming so damn interesting that you forget why you were hung up on them in the first place.

There's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia grads and former Google engineers. Type in something like ""build confidence after rejection"" or ""become more secure in dating as an anxious attacher,"" and it pulls from psychology research, relationship books, and expert insights to create personalized audio content just for you. You can customize the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples. It builds an adaptive learning plan based on your specific struggles and goals, like understanding your attachment patterns or learning to set better boundaries. The voice options are actually addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes heavy topics easier to digest during your commute or gym session.

Third, understand that it's not personal. Someone not liking you romantically doesn't mean you're unlovable. It just means you're not compatible. And that's okay. You don't want to be with someone who has to be convinced to want you.

The psychologist Guy Winch has a great TED talk on emotional first aid that covers rejection. He explains how we need to treat emotional wounds the same way we treat physical ones. Stop picking at the scab. Let yourself heal. Move on.

# The bottom line

Your brain is designed to seek patterns and create narratives. But sometimes the simplest explanation is the right one. If you're constantly confused about where you stand with someone, you have your answer. Confusion is not a sign of mystery or complexity. It's a sign of disinterest dressed up as mixed signals.

Stop waiting for a clear rejection. These 12 signs are your clear rejection. Accept it. Process it. And then find someone who doesn't make you question whether they like you because their actions will make it obvious.",1,1770259411.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qw8zrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1qw8zrf/thoughts_on_holland_america_koningsdam_in_alaska/,Thoughts on Holland America - Koningsdam in Alaska?," We are booked on our first HAL cruise on Koningsdam in Alaska in June of 2027 - l've been rethinking our choice a little for some reason and wanted to post here to get some thoughts. I went to Alaska in June 2024 on Celebrity Edge and really didn't like Celebrity at all so we are doing this trip for hubby. He loves great coffee/sweets/snacks and really enjoys the International Cafe on Princess and the Top Sail Lounge on MSC in Yacht Club so I felt like he would really enjoy Dutch Cafe and Crows Nest on HAL Koningsdam. We also love live music (he's a musician) so l'm hoping he loves the Music Walk.

Does anyone have any thoughts on the included food on HAL? Since we normally cruise MSC Yacht Club Deluxe Balcony cabins or Princess Reserve Class Mini Suites, we usually enjoy elevated dining but not sure anything like that is really needed on HAL? We are planning on trying a couple of the specialty restaurants (definitely Tamarind and maybe Pinnacle Grill or Rudi's) but most of our meals will be in the MDR and I'm guessing buffet/Dutch Cafe? We aren’t really buffet people but not sure what our options will be at that point. And we don’t like seafood and that is a big part of the Alaskan experience but we can work around that. We also love a good thermal spa so will be buying passes for that! 

Also, would you guys recommend just using HAL for excursions as opposed to trying to book independently? Again - we normally use Tours By Locals but I guess l'm just looking for validation that we are going to enjoy HAL, lol.  I think we got a great deal for a Verandah cabin midship on Deck 6 - just $6K for both of us with the Have it All Early Booking Bonus package which includes 1 Specialty Dining, Elite Beverage Package, Prepaid Gratuities and $200 in Shore Excursion credits - $100 each.  Would also love recommendations for tours you have enjoyed in Juneau, Skagway and Ketchikan! 

For context - we are early to mid 60’s, super healthy and fit and appear/act more like folks in their 40’s/50’s. We love good food, music and shows and fun cocktails. 

Thanks so much for your thoughts on this one! ",3,1770258755.0,Cruise,20,1.0,False

1qw8yvf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qw8yvf,A very open-concept semi-custom Ikea kitchen – After/Before,"Firstly, I have to thank this community for being a huge source of education and inspiration. It was so helpful to see examples of other people's before/after, lessons learned etc.

Our kitchen was from the late 80s / early 90s, and I've been dreaming of doing a renovation since we moved in 8 years ago.

It is just my husband and I, and we work from home. I spent a LOT of time in the kitchen, and we love how open concept our home is. We are not terribly handy people, but I do have a design background, so I designed my kitchen myself using the Ikea kitchen planner, and hired Mark Tobin for a helpful 1:1 consult before I proceeded. I then hired a local contractor who did all the project management and product ordering for things like tile, countertops, lighting, etc.   
  
I purchased almost all the products myself well in advance, including the Ikea cabinets + fronts, handles, sink, faucet, appliances, etc.

We wanted to take down a small wall and make the kitchen even more open concept, which meant a ripple effect of other decisions:

\- Moving the dishwasher (to beside the sink)

\- Moving the refrigerator to the back wall

\- Sanding down the popcorn ceilings throughout the whole house (since the whole house is pretty open concept other than bedrooms).

\- Redoing the flooring throughout the whole house, as there was no clear place to ""end"" the tile without it awkwardly jutting into the living room. (In the end i'm so glad we did this because we ended up discovering a leak in the bathroom when we pulled up the floorboards in the bedroom!)

So, since the house IS so open concept, it ended up being so much more than a kitchen renovation, as we ended up changing out potlights throughout the house, bringing electrical up to code, redoing flooring + ceiling throughout (even in bedroom and office), replacing broken pocket doors, mounting the TV to the wall, etc. While we weren't originally planning to do this, I'm very glad we did, because it feels like the whole house got a huge upgrade.

We decided to extend the kitchen along the full length of the wall, integrating it with the window. (I will eventually replace those blinds). We have so much more storage for pantry items, and lots of pull-outs and hidden drawers for things like cookie sheets and pans.

We used Ikea Havstorp dark green for the lower and tall wall cabinets, and Nieu Cabinets in Rhapsody for the island and uppers.  
  
We did lots of little customizations to elevate it, for example the live edge floating shelves below the cabinets with dimmable lighting. (Contractor did a great job matching it as closely as he could to the Nieu Cabinets Rhapsody Uppers).  
We also tiled the back of the full height ""coffee bar"" (90"" Ikea cabinet) and used leftover panels to make it look more finished.

I don't care if green is trendy. I live in the woods and I love my plants, and green has always been my favorite color, so it's a space that makes me feel so happy. The kitchen looks so different depending on the time of day and what windows are open.  
I'm obsessed with the backsplash, it's one of my fave features (next to the lighting!).

I hope you enjoy, and happy to answer any questions!

Main reasons for breaking up with her was incompatibility, dependency, lack of freedom, and I gradually just began to dread the future/marriage with her. For a long time I tried to convince myself that I should stick around, but eventually it got to a point where I couldn’t lie to her nor myself anymore. I still love her and I loved her when I broke up with her, but I knew that I would be shrinking myself if I stayed. 

Anyway, I opened up contact about three weeks after and texted her. I didn’t block her on socials. I obsessively checked her location. A month after I began regretting the breakup for some reason (first time leaving somebody I care about and I was deeply attached) and I spoke to her on the phone about it, but she was clearly already moving on stronger and meeting many new people. I kind of had an ego collapse at that point, as I began feeling that she was better than me or more attractive than me. She started dating somebody new about a week after. I obsessively checked all the socials and all the posts, I left a heartfelt message saying goodbye with no response. 

Then a month after that she broke up with her rebound. I suppose during this month I began to feel better but as soon as I heard that they broke up I found an excuse to call her. This kept the attachment alive, and I made the stupid decision to initiate coffee over Christmas break. Then, skip to Christmas, and I could’ve said no to the text, but I agreed to it. Then we talked for an hour and a half over coffee, and my attachment was right back to full swing. I called her more times over break, kept checking socials, and kept the attachment alive. It’s like a damn parasite that I continue to keep feeding. She left breadcrumbs as well which just perpetually kept me in limbo. 

Back in school in January, and I call her one final time because I seriously could not get the ideas of hope or future out of my head, and I asked her if she ever saw a future of us in the future, and she said not for a longtime. And now I’m

Here. But I’ve lost so much motivation and now I’m in a state of limerence with this person. Has anyone else been in a similar state, and how do I stop comparing myself to her so constantly? How do I end the rumination games in my head? How do I stop living my life for her and begin living it for me?

It’s a really odd scenario because I was the one who initiated the breakup but I’m the one who yearns for her the most. 

I feel like a loser even though I have a lot going for me right now. ",1,1770258677.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

\*\*TITLE:\*\* THE COLUSA PROTOCOL

\*\*SUBTITLE:\*\* An Operating System for the Regenerative State

\*\*TIMELINE:\*\* 2026 – 2066 (The 40-Year Horizon)

\---

To the Citizens of California,

I. THE FOREWORD: THE GREAT UPGRADE\*\*

For too long, we have been told that a clean world requires sacrifice. We were told that to save the planet, we must have less, do less, and earn less.

That was a lie!

Pollution is not a sign of industry; it is a sign of inefficiency.

\- Smog is wasted fuel.

\- Trash is wasted material.

\- Traffic is wasted time.

\- Poverty is wasted human potential.

The Colusa Protocol is not a charity project. It is an Efficiency Upgrade.

We are transitioning California from a ""Gold Rush"" economy (extract, burn, dump) to a Regenerative Economy (capture, cycle, grow). This is a plan that honors the pioneer spirit of self-reliance just as much as it honors the innovation of Silicon Valley.

Under this plan, everyone wins:

\- The Rancher: gets paid to build soil, not just beef.

\- The Tech Giant: gets a stable, fire-proof grid for their servers.

\- The Commuter: gets their time back on a freight-free highway.

\- The Parent gets a check from the Data Dividend.

We are not asking you to ""save the earth."" We are inviting you to build a state that creates more value than it consumes.

\---

II. THE GOVERNANCE PROMISE (TRUST & TIMING)

Why this plan is safe, predictable, and honest.

We recognize that trust in government is at an all-time low. Therefore, this Protocol is built on two non-negotiable values:

1. RADICAL TRANSPARENCY (The ""Glass House"" Standard)

We are ending the era of black-box budgets and internal investigations.

\- The Money: Every dollar spent by the State is tracked on a public blockchain ledger (The Glass Treasury). If we buy a coffee maker, you see the receipt.

\- The Badge: Police misconduct is no longer investigated by the police. It is handled by an Independent Inspector General with full public disclosure.

\- The Promise: We don't ask you to trust us. We give you the tools to audit us.

2. EVOLUTION, NOT REVOLUTION (The ""Ramp"" Strategy)

We do not believe in ""Shock Therapy."" Every major economic shift in this binder follows a 5-Year Transition Ramp.

\- We don't ban plastics overnight; we subsidize the alternatives first.

\- We don't criminalize pollution overnight; we offer amnesty audits first.

\- We don't switch off nuclear power overnight; we bridge it until geothermal is ready.

We prioritize Stability over Ideology.

\---

III. THE THREE PILLARS OF REGENERATION

This binder is divided into 14 Tabs, organized into three structural pillars.

PILLAR 1: THE HARDWARE (Physical Infrastructure)

Building a machine that works with physics, not against it.

\-The Grid (Tab 6): We stop fighting disasters and start harvesting them. Wind turbines that eat storm gales; batteries that drink floodwater.

\-The Land (Tab 8): We move from industrial monoculture to ""Silvopasture,"" turning our farms into massive carbon sinks that cool the planet.

\-The City (Tab 7): We rip up the concrete to ""daylight"" our buried rivers using Incan Hydraulics, lowering city temperatures and raising property values.

\- The Border (Tab 13): We replace the ""Wall"" with a ""Solar Membrane,"" turning the border zone into a bi-national energy park.

PILLAR 2: THE SOFTWARE (Law, Finance & Digital)

Rewriting the code of money and power to reward the good guys.

\-The Money (Tab 3): We divorce Wall Street. We capitalize a Public Bank with our own idle tax revenue to lend to our own cities at 1%.

\-The Accounting (Tab 2): We replace GDP with GEP (Gross Ecological Product). We start measuring—and paying for—soil health, clean air, and happiness.

\-The Digital (Tab 4): We enact Digital Sovereignty, forcing AI companies to pay a ""Data Extraction Fee"" that returns to citizens as a monthly Data Dividend.

PILLAR 3: THE PEOPLE (Human Capital)

Investing in the citizens who run the system.

\-The Service (Tab 11): We solve the student debt crisis and the labor shortage in one move: A ""Green Service Year"" that swaps student loans for forest restoration.

\-The Mind (Tab 11): We return to a Classical Foundation (Logic, Rhetoric) while enforcing Financial Sovereignty (Taxes, Investing, Contracts). We graduate philosophers who can weld and investors who understand debt.

\-The Body (Tab 12): We move from ""Sick Care"" to ""Metabolic Defense,"" designing movement and nutrition into the city itself.

IV. THE HISTORICAL SAFETY NET (PROOF IT WORKS)

Skeptics will ask: ""Has a system like this ever actually worked?""

The answer is; Yes. The Colusa Protocol is not an experiment; it is a Remix of Proven Systems.

Public Banking: North Dakota (1919–Present) | The only state to survive the 2008 crash without a budget crisis. 

Green Service Corps: USA (FDR's CCC) (1933–1942) Planted 3 billion trees and employed 3 million young men. 

Digital Sovereignty: Estonia (1991–Present)  99% of government services are digital; citizens own their data. 

Sovereign Wealth: Norway (1990–Present) Used oil taxes to build a $1.3 Trillion fund for the people. 

Rapid Housing: Singapore (1960–Present) Transitioned from slums to a garden city in one generation. 

We are not inventing the wheel. We are putting it on the car.

V. THE FINAL ASK

This plan is expensive. It is radical. It is dangerous to the status quo.

But the alternative is the status quo: A state that burns every summer, floods every winter, and bankrupts its citizens in between.

The risk of action is high.

The risk of inaction is total.

1qw8rd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1qw8rd0/just_finished_my_first_solo_trip_to_japan_heres/,Just finished my first solo trip to Japan: Here's what I actually learned about navigating it on a budget 🇯🇵,"Okay, real talk. Before I set off for my first solo trip to Japan, my biggest worry wasn't getting lost (though that happened), or navigating the language barrier (also happened). It was the budget. Everyone talks about how expensive Japan is, and honestly, I was bracing myself for impact. Turns out, it's totally possible to experience Japan solo without emptying your savings, but it requires a bit of strategy and a willingness to embrace the *actual* local experience, not just the Instagram-perfect highlights.

Here’s a breakdown of what I actually learned about navigating Japan on a budget:

*   **My Trip Snapshot:**
    *   **Duration:** 12 days, 11 nights.
    *   **Destinations:** Tokyo (Shinjuku, Shibuya, Asakusa, Ueno), Kyoto (Gion, Fushimi Inari, Arashiyama), Osaka (Dotonbori, Shinsekai).
    *   **Accommodation:** Mostly a mix of well-rated capsule hotels and budget business hotels (think APA Hotel, or sometimes a tiny but clean Airbnb room). My trick was to book non-refundable well in advance for better rates.
        *   *Average cost: ~¥4,500-¥6,000 (~$30-40 USD) per night.*
    *   **Transportation:** My trusty **ICOCA card** (the Kansai region equivalent of Suica/Pasmo). I skipped the JR Pass entirely and relied on local trains, subways, and buses. Seriously, the local networks are fantastic for city hopping. HyperDia and Google Maps were my best friends for planning routes.
        *   *Daily spend: ~¥800-¥1,500 (~$5-10 USD) depending on how much ground I covered.* This also accounted for the occasional longer ride between cities.
    *   **Food:** This is where the budget magic *really* happens.
        *   **Konbini (Convenience Stores):** My breakfast and late-night snack saviour. Onigiri, sandwiches, hot coffee, delicious instant ramen – *¥200-¥500 ($1.50-3.50 USD) a meal.* Don't sleep on Lawson's fried chicken.
        *   **Local Eateries:** Ramen shops, udon stalls, gyudon chains (Yoshinoya, Sukiya). Lunch/Dinner for *¥700-¥1,200 ($5-8 USD).* Look for the vending machine ordering systems outside – often a sign of good, cheap food.
        *   **Grocery Stores (Supermarkets):** Great for bentos, fresh fruit, and drinks, especially after 7 PM for discounts.
        *   *Overall daily food spend: ~¥2,500-¥3,500 ($17-24 USD).* Easily kept under control without feeling like I was missing out.
    *   **Activities:** Mostly free or low-cost. Exploring temples (many are free entry or just a few hundred yen), wandering through parks, soaking in vibrant neighbourhoods like Shibuya Crossing or Dotonbori, and street photography. My biggest paid ""activity"" was usually a delicious dessert or a unique local snack.
    *   **Connectivity:** Grabbed an **eSIM** before I left. Super easy, instant data, *~¥2,000 ($13 USD) for 10GB over 15 days.* Absolutely essential for Google Maps and translating on the fly.
    *   **Overall Daily Spend (excluding flights):** Averaged around **¥8,000 - ¥12,000 (~$55-80 USD) per day**. Some days less, some days a bit more if I splurged on a fancy coffee or a souvenir.

Now, let's be real. It wasn't all perfectly planned bento boxes and serene temple walks. I definitely had moments of 'what did I just order?' food roulette, got completely turned around in Shinjuku Station more times than I care to admit, and there were evenings where eating alone felt a little... lonely. But those moments were just as much a part of the learning curve. The biggest surprise? How incredibly safe and welcoming I felt, even as a solo female traveler. People went out of their way to help, often with more gestures than English, and it made every little misstep feel manageable. My biggest takeaway: **Don't over-plan.** Have a rough idea of what you want to see, but let yourself wander. That's where the real discoveries happen, and often, the cheapest ones too. Embrace the unexpected; it’s usually where the best stories come from.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. ",1,1770258146.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

The recommended settings as per K6 manual is 90-120 clicks for pourover and 60-90 for aeropress. If one click of K6 is 16 microns then this 600 microns (size for pourover) comes to be 37 clicks. However if we consider on click to be of 8.5 microns then this is around 70 clicks. 

Q1. So what is the settting of K6 grinder per click?

Q2. What is the grind size to be used in microns for different brewing methods? Different sites have different recommendations, so confused.

Q3.  How does the grid size vary for any brewing method if we change roast of coffee( light to medium to dark)?

But every time there's a recall, some person in the comments always has to post THAT article and remind everyone about what they're eating every day all day long with the FDA allowance levels.

Typically in the past I could just avoid the few things people list like peanut butter. Or screen things like pasta very carefully with my eyes before eating it. (Like cereal I gave up years ago after finding bug parts in constantly) But this time the one they posted had nearly everything listed like chocolate, tomato sauce, bread (I could eat bread all day), fruit juices even jelly, and just everything.

So that made me start screening things heavily, dumping out ramen packets, watching every drop of soda that pours out of a can, examining coffee, etc. Then because family and friends got sick of hearing about it I went to Grok and talked that, Grok tried to reassure me and for a normal person without OCD that probably would have worked. But my OCD didn't take it well when Grok told me I don't need to worry because it's MICROSCOPIC it's bug parts you can't see, ground up, invisible.

Now I'm paranoid of eating ANYTHING.

I mean anything.

I can't eat anything without heavily screening it and even then it's not working anymore. Yesterday I was going to make tea but then remembered bugs can be in tea bags, drank milk instead. Had nothing to eat all day but a burger, no bread, because microscopic bug parts could be ground into it. Today, same, ate a hot dog, no condiments because I recalled the part about ketchup fly egg allowances.  No bun because again bread. 

Still haven't touched chips or the tamales in the fridge sealed. Because cornmeal is heavily infested. Left the deserts untouched. Coffee.. I switched back to only honey no more brown sugar. Only drink that, water, or milk. Maybe soda if I screen it really good. No more juices.

I've literally gone insane now. I know it can't hurt me. I know it's microscopic. But the gross out factor has made my mind say. NO. I'm one of those that just thinking about bugs or something gross will make me start dry heaving over whatever I'm eating.

And unlike anxiety, taking a pill for this does absolutely nothing because it doesn't let you just erase what you read out of your brain. There's no rewind button to having never read it.

I already didn't eat vegetables but I still ate frozen things, and boxes of stuff.

Now my food is, plain burger, plain hot dog, plain lunch meat. Just meat, milk, water, and coffee. That's not sustainable

So I think I've finally lost it....

1qw8mm6,https://i.redd.it/7qjc6lmc5lhg1.jpeg,Review #3: 1958 Jim Beam 109 proof,"For my final drink of the night I am finishing with a personalized bottle of Jim Beam that was bottled in 1958 at 109 proof. I am unsure if the product is proofed down or barrel strength at 109 proof as the still strength and barrel entry proof during this time period was much lower than modern day. This bottle is also age stated 8 years old, so it was distilled in 1950.

You may notice that I have put it in a smaller bottle. Whenever I have a vintage bottle I prefer to rebottle them once they get below half to protect the integrity of the whiskey and prevent oxidation.

Nose: Before I can even get the glass to my nose I am greeted with a burst of dark chocolate jumping out of the glass. Once I get closer to the glass I begin to get one of my favorite notes with vintage Jim Beam and that's the smell of a haybarn. If you have never been in a haybarn they smell like musty grass, mildew, and dust.

Palate: I will start by saying it is nothing short of spectacular. This bourbon dances across your mouth coating it in a delicious seasoned oak. It is very dark with notes of tobacco, dark chocolate, leather and a slight almond note. On a second sip everything is still there but the oakiness is amplified even more.

Finish: The finish on this bourbon is LONG! You have to really like oak to enjoy it as the tannins cling to your mouth. I am almost left drooling as the oak begins to pull the moisture from the inside of my cheeks, and the tobacco note stays with you. On the tail end of the finish I get the smallest tinge of a coffee note clinging to the back of my tongue.

Verdict: This is everything I could want in a whiskey. Its bold, complex, has a wonderful nose, and lingers with you for days. The only thing that I could possibly knock on it is that the proof is a little low and as you sip on it longer and longer it mellows down quite a bit.

Nose: 18/20
Palate: 46/50
Finish: 26/30

Adulting has made making friends weirdly difficult, so here I am doing the most 2026 thing-posting on Reddit

I'm looking to make genuine friends.

Things I'm into:

Evening walks / random city roaming

Coffee, chai & street food hopping

Light conversations, books , memes, overthinking about life

Occasional plans like movies, temple visits, or just sitting and judging traffic

If you're:

From Ahmedabad 

Decent human with good vibes

Also tired of scrolling endlessly and want real conversations

1qw8h95,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qw8h95/stop_letting_emotions_control_you_the_nofluff/,Stop letting emotions control you: the no-fluff guide to not sabotaging your own life,"Ever noticed how one bad mood ruins your whole day? You overreact to a text, skip the gym,
say something dumb in a meeting, then spiral the rest of the day. Most people don’t realize this
— but emotions are *not* instructions. Still, too many treat them like gospel.
So, here’s the deal. If you're constantly acting based on how you feel, you're probably not living
the life *you* want. You're just reacting to stuff. That gets tiring. This post breaks down the real
science and tools to stop that cycle and get your life back on track. No fluff. Just what’s been
proven to work.


1. **Treat emotions like weather, not facts.**
Psychologist Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett explains in *How Emotions Are Made* that emotions
aren't universal reactions. They're predictions our brains make based on past experiences. So
feeling anxious before a presentation doesn’t mean the talk will go badly. It just means your
brain is expecting discomfort. Recognize that, and the emotion loses power.


2. **Name it to tame it.**
Neuroscientist Matthew Lieberman’s research at UCLA found that simply labeling your emotion
— “I feel angry” — reduces amygdala activity and calms the brain down. It gives your logical
brain (the prefrontal cortex) time to come online and make better choices. So next time you’re
triggered, pause and name exactly what you’re feeling. That tiny act creates space before
reaction.


3. **Your body hits first. Learn the signs.**
Psychiatrist Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, author of *The Body Keeps the Score*, shows how trauma
and stress live in our body. Elevated heart rate, clenched jaw, tight chest — those are alarm
bells. Don’t ignore them. Use them as signals to slow down. Ground yourself. Walk. Drink water.
This keeps you from going autopilot mode.


4. **Internal distance = emotional control.**
A study from the University of Michigan found that people who talk to themselves using their
name instead of “I” make better decisions under pressure. It’s called self-distancing. So instead
of “I’m so mad,” say “Why is [your name] feeling mad right now?” It sounds weird but it works.
You create perspective fast.


5. **Don’t *fix* emotions. Let them pass.**
Author and meditation teacher Tara Brach says that emotions, when not resisted, peak and fade
in 90 seconds. The problem? We feed them with thoughts and actions. The more you chase
relief — through food, scrolling, venting — the longer they stick around. Your job isn’t to fix the
emotion. It’s to feel it, observe it, and let it move on.


6. **Routines regulate moods. Period.**
A 2021 paper in *The Lancet Psychiatry* showed that consistent sleeping, eating, and
movement patterns are *strongly* linked to emotional stability. If your moods swing hard, start
there. No mindfulness trick will beat 4 hours of sleep and 3 coffees on an empty stomach.

If you're looking for a place to actually get things done, this is it.

🕯️ **Lighting that helps you focus** The best part is the individual desk lamps at each seat. The overall lighting is dim, which means no distractions—just you and your screen. It’s perfect for those who want to zone out and dive into their work.

☕️ **The Stainless Steel Cup detail** I ordered a hot latte, and it came in a stainless steel cup. It’s a game-changer because my coffee stayed warm until the very last drop, even while I was busy typing away. The latte itself was rich and nutty.

🔌 **Practical details for workers** The long tables are well-equipped with power strips, so you don't have to hunt for an outlet. With the woody interior and calm plants, it feels like you've ""logged out"" of the chaotic Seongsu vibes and entered a quiet sanctuary.

**Quick Info:**

* **Location:** 11 Wangsimni-ro 6-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul (Near Seoul Forest Station)
* **Pro-tip:** It’s open until midnight on weekdays, making it ideal for night owls. Plenty of outlets available!",1,1770257374.0,CafeinKorea,0,1.0,False
1qw8f72,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1qw8f72/breville_sage_precision_brewer_pourover_attachment/,Breville Sage Precision Brewer pourover attachment?,"Hi, I just bought a used machine and am a little confused about what all the pourover attachment entails.

My machine has the red rubber deal (shower screen, I suppose) with 4 holes in it. But the pourover upgrade appears to replace it with a red rubber shower screen with 3 holes in it. Is that the difference, that 3 hole thing will restrict the water flow to make it suitable for the pourover setting? Or is there some other restrictor screen in there, too?

It looks like the rest of the pourover kit is essentially a stand to put a V60 or some other dripper underneath, which I'm not very interested in. 

I'm looking to run the #4 filters in the cone bottom for about 3-4 cups of of coffee in the morning, and just wanted to know if the pourover attachment was worth buying since I'd essentially just be buying it for whatever it does to the shower screen. And I also wanted to doublecheck that it's compatible with the regular cone dripper that comes with the machine, make sure it doesn't require a V60.

If it matters, will mostly be light to medium roasts very coarsely ground in a DF54.

Thanks for any help!",1,1770257282.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False
