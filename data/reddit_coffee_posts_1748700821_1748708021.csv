And I was assigned to train her. We exchanged numbers and then Insta. We don't talk regularly tho but she's kind of flirty and gave me hints, not bold hints but she wants to meet for a coffee. I'm very cautious and didn't make any moves coz of POSH. But she is beautiful and my heart flutters a little. It's not a strong feeling but I do think maybee.. Just mayybee I should give it a chance and see where it goes. I want to take her on a friendly date and don't wanna lose this chance but you've heard that saying ""don't hook up where you VLOOKUP"" (Not gonna hookup) . That's why I'm ignoring her and keeping it professional even in chats. Soon I'll be moving to other department.

How do I proceed with this? At one point, I have heard about POSH cases and another point, I have read stories about how good amount of couples met their partners at office. 

Anyone who has good ending dating their coworkers?

1l00raw,https://www.reddit.com/r/RVLiving/comments/1l00raw/need_some_help_for_storage_solutions/,Need some help for storage solutions,"Good afternoon everyone!

It's been awhile since I've done anything with RVing. We used to own a 1998 Abi Award, but we kept it for a year, we didn't really use it, and we needed to deep clean and fix some things, so we sold it to someone who was going to use it.

Things have since calmed down in life (at least for the summers lol) so we got ourselves a 2023 Jayco Jayfeather 24BH to use with our nephews and friends and other family members who want to come with us.

The thing that I am having issues with is the cups I have, regular glass cups and coffee mugs I can put on the bottom of the cupboard with an anti-slip shelf liner, but I feel like I'm wasting a bunch of cupboard space as this only takes up 1/4 of the space I could use, like if I had a shelf in between I could probably fit my cups into one side of the cupboard rather than having them spread across the bottom.

So my biggest question is, is there something I can get, or even make so I can put a shelf in, or a temporary thing but so I can stack the cups up better to conserve space for other things. This trailer is perfect for us and anybody we would have staying with us, but storage is a little tight. If needed I can provide pictures in a bit so you guys can see what I am talking about, and ways to help. I want something that would be safe for travelling with the RV but also accessible to actually use the cups in question as well.

I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I didn‚Äôt even know if I should confront him right away or wait. But everything in me felt betrayed. My trust, everything I thought I knew about us, was just shattered. And I had no idea how to even begin to process it.

Before you send me a message, I just want to say a few things upfront to save both our time. Not here to waste anyone's time. 

I'm a 36-year-old female looking for a genuine emotional connection‚Äîthe kind where we can talk for hours and really get to know each other. I like taking time, building a real bond, and starting off slowly. 

Important: If you're going to tell me on day two that you're in love with me or want to talk about weird stuff‚Äîplease don't message me. That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm looking for, and it‚Äôs an immediate turn-off. I‚Äôm here for authentic connection, not surface-level nonsense. 
Open to a online relationship, but don't want it to be something that lasts forever. Eventually a in person commitment is expected, if you know you are not interested in a real life connection and don't want to meet in person please don't msg me. 

A little about me:
üåû I love being outside in nature, soaking up the sun to recharge‚Äîmy job can be emotionally draining, so vitamin D is my best friend.

üé∂ Music is life. I honestly can‚Äôt imagine a world without it.

‚òï Coffee is my fuel! No espresso = very depresso üòÇ

üé¨ I‚Äôm into Star Wars, some reality TV, and absolutely love British comedy. That dry humor? Unmatched!

What I'm looking for:
I‚Äôd love to meet someone who‚Äôs strong and kind, probably an introvert, but still willing to engage. I‚Äôm not here to do all the talking or carry the whole convo‚Äîif the energy I get is low-effort, expect the same from me.

If you‚Äôre honest, caring, and actually want to connect on a deeper level, I‚Äôd love to hear from you.

I never thought I‚Äôd be standing on that mountain, ready to jump.  

The wind was cold. My heart was numb. For months, I‚Äôd been drowning‚Äîin guilt, in loneliness, in the crushing weight of feeling like a failure. I *knew* Allah was there, but I couldn‚Äôt feel Him. I hadn‚Äôt prayed in years. I was just‚Ä¶ empty.  

### **The Breaking Point**  
One night, I had a dream so vivid it shook me awake in a sweat.  

I was in a prison cell. The guards dragged me out, and I heard the words: *""Execution at dawn.""* No appeals, no last-minute reprieve. My time was up.  

And then it hit me‚Äî*hard*.  

*""You were born Muslim. You *know* the truth. But you wasted it. You never even *tried*.""*  

I woke up gasping, my heart pounding like it was trying to escape my chest. For the first time in years, I *felt* something‚Äî**fear**. Not just of death, but of standing before Allah with *nothing* to show for my life.  

### **The First Step Back**  
The next day, I forced myself to pray. Just *one* prayer. My body resisted like it was made of lead. My mind screamed: *""You‚Äôve missed so many‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the point now?""*  

But I did it anyway.  

And then I added **two simple habits that changed everything**:  

1. **Morning Quran**: Even just *one ayah* with my coffee. Slowly, the words started to sink into my heart.  
2. **Istighfar (Astaghfirullah) all day**: Every time I felt anxious, guilty, or distracted‚Äî*100x a day*.  

### **The Miracles Started Small**  
- **The Exam I Should‚Äôve Failed:** I walked into a test I hadn‚Äôt studied for, whispered *""Bismillah,""* and somehow *passed*.  
- **The Job That Fell Into My Lap:** A company I barely knew called me out of the blue. A 15-minute interview later, I had a job.  

But the *real* miracle? **The weight lifting from my chest**. The more I recited Quran in the mornings and said istighfar, the *lighter* I felt. Like Allah was wiping my slate clean, day by day.  

### **Where I Am Now**  
It wasn‚Äôt overnight. Some days, I still fight my nafs. But now:  
- **I pray not out of guilt, but *love***  
- **The haram I craved? It lost its grip**  
- **The anxiety that choked me? Replaced with *sakina* (tranquility)**  

If He could save *me*‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôd ignored Him for years‚ÄîHe *will* save you too.  

**Start small. Beg Him at Tahajjud. Try morning Quran + istighfar. Watch what happens.**  

*You don‚Äôt have to be perfect. You just have to turn to Him.*

And I watched this over and over as ""study noises"" but also cause i liked how i felt listening to them. Then later I had this game where, hey, basically slighter io except I genuinely felt a dopamine rush playing it and would play it daily. Couldnt stop playing it.

Afterwards it was intense skin picking, scalp picking, picking at my skin cause i was 100% certain there were a bunch of warts there, ect.

(This whole time I had a steady increase in paranoia and eventually hearing things, which... currently has mostly stopped. Not completely... but its alot better (also no stress from classes, however I'd pick at my skin alot when stressed.). Went to a therapist and got told i had psychosis symptoms... which have sorta stopped now that i'm not taking any classes. (I also was intensly hyper last semester and it went down afterwards. Felt like it was hypomania or mania but i never got a bipolar diagnosis).

Genuinely was extra paranoid I was being drugged by others but maybe it was just me upping my dopamine to the point I thought I had a spiritual awakening (sigh). 

Got to the point I thought others were reading my mind, telepathy devices, someone was keeping tabs on me and there were hidden recording devices (and caffine in general just spiked this up exponentially).

;\_; Did I spike my dopamine by like random sh-t? Trying to undo it by just meditation, calm music, not eating anything sweet, and limiting coffee to 2-3 times a week, and working out roughly 2 times a week (i dont always follow any of this).

I was also at 0 productivity but I've gotten myself out of that.

Is it possible to physically feel dopamine rushes in your brain? I'd spend hours picking at my skin and I think i ruined my brain with that.

The next day, I forced myself to pray. Just *one* prayer. My body resisted like it was made of lead. My mind screamed: *""You‚Äôve missed so many‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the point now?""*  

But I did it anyway.  

And then I added **two simple habits that changed everything**:  

1. **Morning Quran**: Even just *one ayah* with my coffee. Slowly, the words started to sink into my heart.  
2. **Istighfar (Astaghfirullah) all day**: Every time I felt anxious, guilty, or distracted‚Äî*100x a day*.  

### **The Miracles Started Small**  
- **The Exam I Should‚Äôve Failed:** I walked into a test I hadn‚Äôt studied for, whispered *""Bismillah,""* and somehow *passed*.  
- **The Job That Fell Into My Lap:** A company I barely knew called me out of the blue. A 15-minute interview later, I had a job.  

But the *real* miracle? **The weight lifting from my chest**. The more I recited Quran in the mornings and said istighfar, the *lighter* I felt. Like Allah was wiping my slate clean, day by day.  

### **Where I Am Now**  
It wasn‚Äôt overnight. Some days, I still fight my nafs. But now:  
- **I pray not out of guilt, but *love***  
- **The haram I craved? It lost its grip**  
- **The anxiety that choked me? Replaced with *sakina* (tranquility)**  

If He could save *me*‚Äîsomeone who‚Äôd ignored Him for years‚ÄîHe *will* save you too.  

**Start small. Beg Him at Tahajjud. Try morning Quran + istighfar. Watch what happens.**  

*You don‚Äôt have to be perfect. You just have to turn to Him.* ",1,1748707158.0,Muslim_Space,0,1.0,False

1l00fnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1l00fnz/oh_those_darn_buddhists_did_you_ever_run_into/,"""Oh, those darn Buddhists!"" Did you ever run into other SGI members or leaders who claimed the credit for YOUR achievement?","[From 2004](https://web.archive.org/web/20041030082012/http://www.fraughtwithperil.com/blogs/melanie/archives/2004_04.html):

>Oh those darn Buddhists!

>This morning, I lost my Daimoku chart. Or, at least I couldn‚Äôt find it. Myoho. I have my suspicions about how it ‚Äúwalked away,‚Äù but my main suspect denied outright that he messed around with my Buddhist papers (despite an incriminating notebook mysteriously lying on the coffee table near the Budsadan . . .)

>I couldn‚Äôt have lost my chart if I had been more diligent in chanting every morning and evening. **It‚Äôs my fault.** But while I was tearing the drawer apart searching for the chart, I thought of **something that has been a minor irritant to me**.

The thing about ""the last straw"" is that it's *always* something minor, even *trivial*. The reason it functions as ""the last straw"", though, is that this is adding onto ""[the great mountain of wrongs we've already accumulated](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/u9e46m/what_was_the_sgi_straw_that_broke_the_camels_back/), as someone described it, at the hands of ""[the wondrous products of ""human revolution""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExSGISurviveThrive/comments/rehq2u/unattractiveness_and_general_weirdness_of_sgi/) one encounters in the Ikeda cult"". 

I'm sure many, if not most, of you all noticed how:

- If you have a problem with the SGI or one of your SGI leaders or fellow members, it's YOUR responsibility and YOU need to chant about it to fix it.
- If the SGI or one of your SGI leaders or fellow members has a problem with you, it's YOUR responsibility and YOU need to chant about it to fix it.

>In the summer of 1999, a job opening came available at the University of Nevada, Reno where I was working as an intern in the Office of Communications. I applied for it and **then applied myself to chanting and going to meetings in order to make causes to get this job**. 

SGI defenders *love* to claim ""There's *nothing* 'magic' about it - it's all about focusing your energy toward your goals"" or some such twaddle, even though Ikeda *himself* described the nohonzon as ""[Aladdin's Lamp](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/14n80im/ikeda_the_gohonzon_aladdins_lamp/)"" (which is magic) and SGI members/leaders/publications *frequently* refer to chanting in terms of ""a [wish-granting jewel](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/19d6vid/sgi_members_you_believe_some_straight_up_stupid/)"". It's RIGHT THERE IN THE OPEN.

So here this person is, disclosing the SGI-indoctrinated magical-thinking mindset, e.g., ""do LOTS of chanting and stuff for SGI if you want to accomplish your goals in life!""

>I went a number of times to a fellow member‚Äôs apartment and chanted with him, sometimes helping him with guests he brought and sometimes bringing other members with me. We were sort of a rogue group ‚Äì these weren‚Äôt official meetings, just plain old-fashioned daimoky tozos and gongyos together with friends.

In the >20 years since that ‚Üë was written, SGI has [really cracked down](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExSGISurviveThrive/comments/vgafsb/sgi_breaking_friendships_between_members_apart/jro8y77/) on this sort of ""unsanctioned meeting"". SGI wants to control *everything* the SGI members are exposed to.

>I got the job. Hallelujah! I could divorce my husband, take care of my daughter and continue in grad school!

>**What‚Äôs bugging me is that I heard a rumor that the member who opend up his house to me was running around the chapter telling people he had ‚Äúgotten me the job.‚Äù** Now, that‚Äôs not exactly true. In order to lead up to the fortune of getting this job, I had to work my way through UCLA, work as a journalist for a decade, win a bunch of awards, as well as excel in my internship. It was a regional search and I beat about 40 or 50 other applicants, but **to arrogantly claim that he, and he alone, got me the job, didn‚Äôt sit right with me**.

I guess *not!*

This is simply a natural extension, though, of how the Dead-Ikeda-Corpse-Mentor-cult SGI claims credit for *all* your achievements as the product of your SGI membership, practice, activities - oh, and ""mentor"" ü§Æ - while every failure or problem is blamed on YOU in some way - your ""[karma](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExSGISurviveThrive/comments/g8puaa/karma_victim_blaming/)"", your weak practice, your lack of ""seeking spirit toward your mentor"", your need to ""[do more human revolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/2jcmwa/original_sin_vs_human_revolution/)"", you're being ""[ungrateful](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/qx6ikc/sgis_fuckedup_perspective_on_gratitude_where_it/)"", you need more ""[appreciation](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/329sss/sgi_is_a_slave_religion_no_different_from/)"", there's no shortage of ways to blame YOU.

Oh, and *now* it's all about *Ikeda*, too!

>>Also, notice how they just *have* to shoehorn Ikeda in there. Ikeda does not belong in there. It's not supposed to be about Ikeda. The Nichiren Shoshu priest who conducted MY gojukai ceremony (gohonzon conferral) certainly never mentioned the Nichiren Shoshu High Priest! He wasn't *there* and it wasn't about *HIM!* But SGI is different. SOOOO different. And *better!* Remember that, kids! [Source](https://archive.ph/NPePY#selection-1569.0-1585.21)

[""Ikeda is everything or your Nichiren practice is nothing.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/2d5ugx/ikeda_is_everything_or_your_nichiren_practice_is/)

>Especially since **this member is a one of the troubling ones who have tended to de-shakubuku me through their behavior**. He doesn‚Äôt have a job of his own, nor has he had one in the many years I‚Äôve known him. He has at least five children with various women and he pays not one dime of child support. He‚Äôs on welfare and has busted out front teeth. This last point is, I admit, the most petty of my complaints. But it seems to me that if you were serious about doing shakubuku, you would ‚Äì after 25 years of practice ‚Äì have chanted for the fortune to [get your damn teeth fixed so people at least wouldn‚Äôt automatically assume you are the bum you actually are](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExSGISurviveThrive/comments/rehq2u/unattractiveness_and_general_weirdness_of_sgi/joo43oe/).

""Actual proof"" *AGAIN*

We can all see it üò≥

>Anyhow, I haven‚Äôt talked to him in at least a year. To be fair, he did do me the extreme favor of handing me a book called ‚ÄúThe Passive-Aggressive Man,‚Äù which could have been a detailed account of my life with my ex. It blew my mind and gave a name to the situation I was in and how to deal with it. So no hard feelings.

This illustrates the *[importance](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1iniade/new_here/mcdlvll/)* of having the right *[WORDS](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/b1i9j5/many_treasures/eimbdu1/)* to describe a situation - it's *essential* to understanding it. How many of you had that lightbulb moment üí° when you first saw or heard someone refer to [SGI as a ""cult""](https://i.imgur.com/rtPjupR.png)? Once you have the right *vocabulary*, not only can you describe to others what happened, but you can [understand it](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1igg1vy/sgis_toxic_teachings_on_resilience_and_adversity/) and process it *[for yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1i8swti/looking_back_at_the_hard_process_of_leaving/m8xphv7/)*.

Like‚Äî*actually* thoughtful, respectful, and ngl, very easy on the eyes üòÖ

Now here's the complicated part: I'm Armenian-American, and I was kinda lowkey scared at first. I didn‚Äôt know how he‚Äôd react to me, and I‚Äôve grown up with all these stories and tension and whatever. So I didn‚Äôt tell him I‚Äôm Armenian right away... I chickened out. I just assumed he‚Äôd maybe not vibe with it or shut me down. But honestly? He‚Äôs been nothing but kind and lovely, and I feel like he totally changed the way I used to think.

Anywayyy, I wanna get to know him better‚Äîlike actually hang out and talk‚Äîbut I literally have no clue how to approach a Turkish guy romantically. Sooo I‚Äôm here asking y‚Äôall for help because I feel lost lol.   
  
How do Turkish guys usually flirt or date? Would it be a big deal if I told him I‚Äôm Armenian later? Or like... is that a conversation I should just have early? Could he end up judging me for it or is that just in my head??And what‚Äôs a typical first date like for you guys?

I‚Äôve even started learning some Turkish (very slowly lol i sound ridiculous) and I‚Äôve been thinking of doing something cute like giving him a small cultural gift or something. Maybe taking him to a Turkish restaurant around here if he‚Äôs open to that?

Also‚Äîhelp a girl out: what are some sweet or meaningful Turkish gifts I could give him without coming off as a total weirdo? I was thinking like a nazar (evil eye?) charm or maybe Turkish coffee? Or is that too basic? üòÇ I just want to show I care and I‚Äôm making an effort, but without doing *too much* if you know what I mean lol.

Oh and he's 23, and told me he lived in Istanbul before moving here‚Äîthought that might help context-wise.

Up until very recently, I‚Äôve not actually paid much attention to making good coffee. It‚Äôs been incremental changes from preground grocery story beans to whole beans from local quality roasters, grinding with a cheap blade grinder. Added a basic metal tamper. More recently, I decided to invest in a much better grinder ‚Äì DF64 Gen 2 (at least much better relative to my old blade grinder).

The machine choked on finer grind settings (under 10), so that‚Äôs when I started learning more about dialling it. I bought bottomless portafilter to watch the action, gravity distributor, 3D printed WDT tool (uses acupuncture needles), and started weighing out my beans.

But I am struggling. I‚Äôve tried two different types of fresh beans from Detour coffee (Bottleneck and Punch Buggy). I‚Äôve tried volumes anywhere from 14g to 18g of beans. I‚Äôve tinkered with grind settings (everywhere from 13 to 21 on the DF64G2). I‚Äôve tried adding and removing gravity distributor.

I‚Äôve tried faking preinfusions. I‚Äôve tried running just water through the machine first to improve temp and heat the grouphead. I‚Äôve tried heating the portafilter and basket in hot water. All things recommended elsewhere in coffee forums, videos, etc.

My extraction just‚Ä¶ relentlessly sucks.

If I go with a coarser grinds (17+), I can pull shots more easily but can‚Äôt really taste anything. At finer grinds (16.5 and lower), the machine chokes repeatedly ‚Äì I usually have to press the button at least twice to push water through the puck and it‚Äôs often slow, over-extracted, and channels.

At no point in the last month of pulling daily shots (or in today‚Äôs case, pulling five or six shots in a row), have I observed water pour through all (or even 70%) or the holes in the portafilter.

I see some people pulling very beautiful shots with the same setup, but it‚Äôs just not happening for me. I was determined to to try and dial in a good shot with the Dedica and develop my skills on that before upgrading to something higher quality, but a part of me wonders if I‚Äôm just pushing up against the limitations of the machine.

1kzzxob,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kzzxob/aita_for_ruining_my_exs_job_opportunity/,AITA for ruining my ex's job opportunity?,"So this happened about a month ago, and I need some outside opinions ITS A LONG ONE. Sorry for any error, english is not my first language.  
FOR CONTEXT:

Me and my Ex, let's call him ""Brian"", met on the job. I was working there already for about 2 years, and I was very close to my Boss and my female coworkers.  
My boss needed to recruit someone to help me on my position, since I was the only one and needed help, and there was an ongoing joke between them that she would find me my soulmate. I always laugh about the situation and joked ""ya ya some dirty man with nasty teeth"".

However, it came a day that she did recruit someone and teased me on the day the new person should arrive, ""I did find it! you will see"" and I again, laugh it off.

So it's the lunch break, and we are all outside talking and laughing, and we see someone arriving on a motorcycle, and my boss came outside. At this point she looked at me and I understood right away this was the new recruit, but as Brian was getting close by, my coworkers and I just stop talking. This man was Beautiful, and right away I started to become red in the face. My boss informed us this would be our colleague and that I needed to prepare to make a presentation about us since he was coming to work directly with me.   
SHE NEVER INFORMED ME ABOUT THIS BEFORE.   
As soon as they enter the building my coworkers teased me again which made me very nervous. I went, I panicked, couldn't look him in the eye and my Boss just smiled, enjoying the show. Looking back, it should have been a very funny moment tbh.

Fast forward we became fast friends, we connected in many ways and ended up falling in love, He took me to a beach and asked me to be his girlfriend and I was truly happy, the same day we went to meet his parents and there's where all went down the drain.   
His Mom, lets call her ""Karen"" took a look at me when we met that it literally chilled my heart. Now Brian is a mommas boy, the worse kind, but at this point I didn't know. His Father was very kind to me as well as the rest of the relatives that were present.   
Karen at some point, after ignoring me the whole lunch and pretending I didn't exist, asked for my age. I was 21F and Brian 32M, (I know the age difference was huge but it didnt matter to us), I actually told her I was 22, and she made a disgusting face and kept ignoring me the rest of the time we were there.

Brian took me home and I told him that his mother did not like me, and he said that she would learn to like me as soon as she knew me, and that he loved me very much. We had a truly amazing relationship, we never argued, I felt like we were made for each other, and that we would get through this as well, that's what I hoped, and went home.

Next day Brian asked me to meet him on a coffee shop and told me ""we needed to break up"", no reason given. Well this broke me, I cried, he cried, a whole mess, and we agreed we would stay friends.

Friends my ass, because we were in a relationship in everything except in name, basically exclusive Friends with Benefits, but noone knew. One of our coworkers later told me that he told her that he did love me, but his mother didnt like me, and thats why he broke up with me. And I thought as much but never said anything.

Now this lasted 4 years (until 25F and 36M), of everyday talking, laughing, he stayed at my house very often, but then COVID hit us. I lost my job, and he was very scared of the whole thing and stopped coming so often to my house because Karen ""was a sensible woman and needed her boy home"".   
We would talk all lovey-dovey every day and I believed everything was normal. Until he told me that he started talking with one of his Ex's who went to live in another continent, which at the time it seemed ok for me, I actually said I was happy for him, as my best friend was actually my Ex as well (John 26M), and we stayed best friends since we separated. Me being an ignorant little girl saw the red flag and just pretended I didn't see.

3 days later, Brian was talking to me all normal, all lovey-dovey as usual and out of nowhere he told me ""I'm moving in with my girlfriend""

I'll be honest, I think the world stopped spinning, I froze, and I asked him ""what? sorry what do you mean"" (while nervously laughing) and he told me he got back with his Ex, she came back, and they are together.  
I was so shocked, so dumbfounded, I just replied ""Oh ok, I need to go now"". I never confronted him, I never said a word, this broke me so deeply that I didn't have the energy, mind you this assh\*le was in my bed 2 days prior. I was disgusted, I felt stupid, everything you could think of.

And guess the worst part? My dumb ass still talked with him everyday for about 2 months (we played games online with 2 friends, so we were constantly on a call with all of us), he still talked to me all sweet like nothing happened, calling me baby and stuff like that, and I wouldn't reply, made me sick but I continued playing the part of the friend.

The breaking point for me was when my Brother (18M) came out has transgender (M to F) and I was talking with them about the situation and Brian called her a freak, that no person in their right mind would be a transgender and that she was sick and needed help. I LOST MY MARBLES, I yelled with him so much, called him every name on the book, exited the call and blocked them all everywhere, since all agreed. Didn't even gave him a chance to reply. And we never spoke since then.

It's been a few years, I'm 30F, I have the most amazing boyfriend and surprise surprise, it was my Best Friend John, we were high school sweethearts and we connected again. It's been amazing and he helped me heal with all the bullshit that happened, it was so bad that I would recoil from any physical contact because I was disgusted, but we got through it together.

Now I've been working at this very popular furnishing company, you know blue and yellow, everyone knows it. I actually applied because Brian told me several years before that he had work there before and it was very nice, and indeed it was, I really love my job.  
This company is very serious about LGBT, they want everyone to be able to work there, feeling safe and protected, and any mean comment about any LGBT coworker that is reported to HR results in the person being fired right away.

One day I was walking to my TL to ask about something, and she was looking at people that they were going to interview, and there it was, his fucking face on a CV that my TL was looking at, and I just said ""Oh hell no, You cannot recruit that person"". She looked at me all confused, and I explained the situation of my Sister and his reply.

My TL knew the difficulties my sister was enduring with the family and how I was trying to help, and she took my opinion very seriously and informed HR right away that Brian wasn't a fit candidate, and his application was declined.

To be honest, I was so happy, I had my little petty revenge, but only because I was honest, I didn't plan it, he would never know, and I could keep working without seeing his face ever again. But now I'm doubting if I went too far. 

So AITA for ruining my ex's job opportunity?

My nose is still not developed and I am still learning to pick out individual notes. I am now able to pick out certain notes but I may not know what those notes are called. So take my review as a perspective from someone beginner. I did a blind test between the 3 Khamrah's with my girlfriend, both on skin and clothes, which I will add along with my thoughts. Now with the disclaimer out of the way, let's start with the review:

1. Lattafa Khamrah OG:
It's a boozy fragrance (reminds me of sweet bourbon) that opens up with a sweet spice (cinnamon or nutmeg maybe?) and settles down into dates with a vanilla base. This is very good for cooler nights like in Bengaluru. If I had to do a dumb reach for a date night fragrance, this would be it. GF doesn't like the opening, likes the mid notes, but doesn't like the base üòÖ.
GF comments: ""It smells like something very sweet with a vanilla undertone. Doesn't it smell like meethi daaru üòÇ? Feels like a lot of sweet things are added and blended in daaru.""
Rating: 8/10

2. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa:
The Qahwa is essentially the OG whose sweetness is a little bit toned down with the addition of a warm roasted Coffee note. I saw many reviews saying that the coffee not is just in the opening and both the OG and the Qahwa are the same in their drydown. But to my nose, I am distinctively able to identify the coffee note separately even after 2 hours of application (I will come to the performance of all the Khamrahs a little later). This maybe due to me being a coffee addict who guzzles 4-5  espressos a day, so my nose might be more sensitive towards coffee. Anyway, the Qahwa essentially leans more masculine than the OG. I would wear it on the same occasions as the OG. GF hates this but I like it the most.
GF comments: ""This smells like someone burnt some marshmallows and added them to a less sweet vanilla pastry üòÇ. I don't like this roasted smell. This is too strong.""
Rating: 9/10

3. Lattafa Khamrah Dukhan:
The Dukhan is essentially the OG whose intensity is a little bit amped up with the addition of a spicy Tobacco note. Many reviews said the Dukhan is essentially an intense OG which I partially agree to but not fully. The tobacco note lingers almost throught into the drydown and intensifies the strength. I would choose it over the OG if I am in the mood. GF doesn't like the initial top notes but after that she likes it more compared to the other 2.
GF comments: ""This is strong. Is it zarda-gutkha? Why do you always get zarda, gutkha, daaru, smoke perfumes ü´†? Now it smells better (after 15 mins), atleast better than the previous ones.""
Rating: 8.5/10

Longevity and Performance:
All the 3 have good performance. The Qahwa and Dukhan project for 1.5 - 2 hours on a cool night and then last 7 - 8 hours easily and more than a day on my clothes. On the other hand, the OG projects for 1 hour and then lasts 6 - 7 hours on skin and 12 hours on clothes.
Dukhan very slightly edges Qahwa in longevity (emphasis on very slightly - like maybe 20 - 30 minutes more). And both of them handily beat the OG in performance.

If someone has all 3 (strongly advise against getting all 3 unless you are a collector or willing to splurge), this is how I would use them:

OG - The dumb reach for cool date nights or night outs with friends (if you are dressed a bit better). The OG is very mass-pleasing but not something unique. For me it doesn't have a soul (don't take it the wrong way, it's a very good perfume for what it sells for).

Qahwa - The masculine one for coffee dates (even in the day if the weather is cold). This will make you smell unique unlike the OG.

Dukhan - The special occassion one for someone special ü•∞ or for evening festivities.

If someone wants to buy just 2, I would say get the Qahwa and Dukhan. They are the most distinctive. You can also choose Qahwa and OG if you don't like the tobacco note or if you want a clean sweet boozy fragrance. If you already have the OG and want to add another Khamrah, get the Qahwa.
If you want to only get 1, then either of the 3 will serve you very well. Just choose based on your preference. If you just want a dumb reach go for the OG, you can never go wrong. If you want to smell unique, go for Qahwa or Dukhan.

Qahwa BNIB - Whiff Culture

OG and Dukhan Decants - Sovereign Scents


Summary / TLDR:

OG - Sweet Boozy Dates with a Vanilla base.

N√£o consegui dar a devida aten√ß√£o a todos os lugares. No Pato Rei, no Takko e no Fora da Lei foram os √∫nicos que realmente sentei pra comer e tomar caf√©, por isso vou comentar somente sobre eles. 
No KOF s√≥ peguei um gr√£o e sa√≠ e no CoffeeLab (acabei n√£o tirando foto) peguei um copo pra viagem de Aeropress porque tinha acabado de comer e tomar caf√©. L√° n√£o me interessei por nenhum gr√£o. 


Pato Rei Pinheiros: achei que cumpriu com minhas expectativas. Era o que mais queria ir. Al√©m de f√£ de caf√© especial, sou f√£ do Taviao desde os tempos de role gourmet. Comida foda, espresso deuso melhor espresso que tomei na vida. O coado achei normal, menos do que o esperado (geisha flor ao cubo). O mais caro de todos, mas d√° pra maneirar. Voltarei com certeza.

Takko: cafeteria bem conceitual, entrega bastante. Tomei um latte (nada especial), mas o lugar e a comida s√£o √≥timas. Comi um toast de cogumelo perfeito. Tem v√°rias op√ß√µes de caf√© que poderia pedir, mas como j√° tinha tomado muitos casos,fui no leitinho. Voltarei com certeza.

Fora da Lei: latte caramelo √≥timo, melhor atendimento em rela√ß√£o aos outros dois. S√≥ a comida que fica um pouco a desejar, poucas op√ß√µes. N√£o √© um lugar pra comer de fato, o forte √© o caf√©, com v√°rias op√ß√µes de gr√£os que eles mesmos torram. Mas o cookie que pedi estava muito bom. Comprei um gr√£o fermentado. Assim que provar, colo por aqui.
*Esse conheci por indica√ß√£o desse subreddit. Valeu

Em suma, sa√≠ muito contente. Acabei n√£o desfrutando tanto de todas, porque muitas s√£o pr√≥ximas (Pinheiros), mas o que tamb√©m √© uma coisa boa, pois assim volto e tenho mais coisas a conhecer. ",8,1748705517.0,cafebrasil,2,1.0,False

Im not ready for my business to grow because i'm still learning, im in culinary school on weekends which will end soon and then I'd be ready to expand. BUT i do have some dead days where I do get no orders, then days where I get an overwhelming amount of orders. If i keep my business small will that mean I failed? Because thats what everyone makes me feel like. 

I have been contacted by alot of reputable food bloggers where i'm from that want me to send them cookies to promote my business but am I stupid for refusing? I really cant see my self meeting a higher demand, so why bother advertise if I will have to refuse most orders. 

I want to sell low quantities when I feel like selling. I did the whole business to business thing, I did so well  (for the coffee shops I sold to, but undersold myself as a business) that the coffee shops I sold to are trying to get me back, but really it took a huge tole on me and my business. Since I was behind the scenes nobody really knew it was me back then.

Is there such thing as a low production bakery type thing? Has anyone seen it workout? Temporarily atleast.

My friend told me to offer the chair we weren't using. Mind you she knew I have social anxiety due to previous mental health issues but is aware that I'm trying to overcome it. Well, she also still has the image of me previously before I had mental health issues which is a pretty outgoing person. 

I looked at her twice to confirm if I really have to, signaling her that I feel like I couldn't. She presuades me to do so.

I tried to catch the attention of the father, but my voice was too soft (more of a whisper). 

I looked at her again that it did not work and signaling her that I tried and to please stop. She persuades me again. 

Itmade my voice a bit louder and also moved the chair to try to catch the attention of the father (they were about a foot near us), but it did not work. 

Again, I looked at her and now I told her that it really did not work and to just let it be. She persuades me again. 

Took a deep breath and tried to visualize my previous self and increased the volume of my voice. The father finally took notice, thanked me, and took the chair. 

I smiled and looked at my friend, let out a sigh of relief, and trembled a lot. I also was comforting myself by patting my arms while trembling. 

She noticed and held my arms too and whispered, ""proud of you.""

I was still trembling and couldn't get it out of my head and told her that ""I was really scared."" 

She told me not to overthink it while holding my arms and that she was really proud. 

I thanked her for doing that, both persuading and comforting me. 

It wasn't a huge step but I was still proud of it.

Sagittan whiskey didn‚Äôt leave a hangover, but there was no way to go through a chessboxing match, a barroom brawl, a night of no sleep, lots of dancing, and two plates of Dragon‚Äôs Tongue kebab without suffering some consequences.

Jeridan and Negasi sat slumped in a booth in a cheap diner as the early morning sun shone through the grimy window. The dispenser at their table was broken and instead of the black coffee they both desperately needed, it was dispensing apple juice mixed with coffee grounds. Neither of them had noticed yet. Negasi had his head on the table and was drifting in and out of sleep, letting out a toxic belch every few minutes.

Jeridan looked blearily out the window as the sun rose on his first day without a ship. A newsvid attached to the far wall chattered in the background. A few other diners, human and alien, slurped and belched at the other tables. Jeridan ignored them all.

He hurt everywhere‚Äîhis face, his ribs, his stomach (inside and outside), his knuckles, and an especially sore spot on the side of his head. He reached up and touched it, coming away with a few bits of glass that had been stuck in his hair.

Someone had hit him with a bottle? Typical rich brats, fighting unfair.

Oh wait, that had been the waitress trying to break up the fight.

All right, now he didn‚Äôt feel guilty about leaving without paying.

What were they going to do? Their credits wouldn‚Äôt last more than a couple of weeks, and the rent would soon be due at the warehouse. They had a small fortune in whiskey that was worthless until they got it off planet.

They couldn‚Äôt even get decent jobs. Nobody wanted to hire someone with a low credit rating. It meant they were ‚Äúnot a good fit for teamwork enterprises‚Äù or ‚Äúnot fully engaged in the economic system‚Äù or a million other corporate phrases for wanting to be your own person.

They‚Äôd been through all this before on other planets. Once you were in the hole, it was damn hard to dig yourself out.

Jeridan turned away from the view of the ugly street as something on the newsvid caught his attention. A pretty announcer, way out of Jeridan‚Äôs league in his present circumstances, was talking about a comm probe that had just made it to Sagitta Prime.

‚ÄúThe latest report from the Tyrul system says the invaders have taken Tyrul Beta and Sigma. Tyrul Alpha is expected to fall within weeks. The comm probe included some images of the invading ships, which experts are unable to identify.‚Äù

The newsvid switched to a series of pixilated images, obviously taken from long distance, showing those strange starships again. The images were too poor quality to see much detail, but Jeridan had to agree with the so-called experts. He‚Äôd never heard of ships like that in known space.

‚ÄúThe ships are estimated to be five kilometers in width,‚Äù the announcer said, making his jaw drop. ‚ÄúThe Tyrulians report that even their strongest weapons had little effect. We‚Äôll be following this breaking story as further details become available. Now on to the entertainment news.‚Äù

Jeridan belched and looked away from the screen. The nearest point of the Tyrul cluster was 162 light years away. Even a comm probe‚Äîa small transmitter and hard drive attached to a powerful engine‚Äîwould take a month to get here from there. Far faster than any crewed vessel, but long enough ago that Tyrul Alpha may have been overrun already.

The reports had been coming in for a year now. Comm probes had been telling of the destruction of systems toward the outer rim, each star system falling one by one as the invaders, whatever they were, moved closer and closer to the local region where Jeridan and Negasi flew.

One more problem beyond their control to worry about.

*The aliens can‚Äôt kill us if we starve to death first.*

Jeridan reached across the table and shook Negasi, who was resting his head on his arms.

‚ÄúRmph?‚Äù his gunner mumbled.

‚ÄúSmartest thing you‚Äôve said all evening, partner. Time to go back to the hotel and sleep it off.‚Äù

His copilot raised a thumb without raising his head. ‚ÄúA good evening, buddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOne of the best,‚Äù Jeridan said without enthusiasm.

‚ÄúWe slaughtered those rich boys.‚Äù

Jeridan chuckled. ‚ÄúThey should have brought more numbers if they wanted to tangle with us.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe would have knocked every one of them out if they hadn‚Äôt called the cops.‚Äù

Cops? Jeridan tried to focus. He had a vague memory of sprinting through alleys as a police hovercar chased them. How had they gotten away from that? Instinct, most likely. It‚Äôs what usually saved them.

Negasi lifted his head and tried to focus his bleary eyes. He looked past Jeridan and focused on something.

‚ÄúWe got company,‚Äù he said.

Jeridan jerked his head around, expecting a phalanx of police officers and a beaten up and irate rich boy pointing his broken finger at them. Instead, he saw a woman standing just inside the doorway. She was thin and looked about forty, with shoulder-length brown hair. She wore canvas work clothes, but they were clean and she had an intelligent, businesslike look to her. Jeridan pegged her as a supervisor or an on-site engineer.

She looked right at them.

Jeridan put on a winning smile. A bit old for him, but she was the only woman in the place who didn‚Äôt look like she was down to her last few credits.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?‚Äù he asked her.

Negasi cocked his head. ‚ÄúSeriously? That‚Äôs the best you could come up with?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long day,‚Äù Jeridan replied.

‚ÄúAnd an even longer night, from the look of it,‚Äù the woman said. ‚ÄúAre you Jeridan Cook and Negasi Gao?‚Äù

The two friends glanced at each other.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not from the bank, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre worried about,‚Äù the woman said, approaching their booth.

‚ÄúWhy would we be worried about the bank?‚Äù Jeridan said. ‚ÄúMr. Farnsworth over at the Central Bank is a personal friend of ours.‚Äù

The woman sat down. ‚ÄúYou must be Jeridan. I‚Äôve been told you‚Äôre an inveterate liar.‚Äù

Negasi laughed, then let out another toxic belch.

‚ÄúAnd you must be Negasi. You‚Äôre just as I pictured you.‚Äù

‚ÄúRacist,‚Äù Negasi hiccupped.

The woman waved a hand in front of her face. ‚ÄúI was referring to your breath, not your skin color.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook lady, we‚Äôve had enough abuse for one day,‚Äù Jeridan said. ‚ÄúWho are you, and what do you want?‚Äù

The woman put her arms on the table and leaned forward, studying them. ‚ÄúMy name is Nova Bradford, and I want to offer you a job.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho told you we need work?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecca at customs is a friend of mine.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecca,‚Äù Negasi belched. ‚ÄúGood woman.‚Äù

Nova wrinkled her nose. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been eating Dragon‚Äôs Tongue kebab, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúTastes good going down,‚Äù Jeridan said, then let out a spicy belch. ‚ÄúNot so good coming up. Are they really made from the tongues of dragons?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to know what they‚Äôre made of.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the job?‚Äù

‚ÄúI need a crew for my ship, the *Antikythera*.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened to your old crew?‚Äù Jeridan asked.

Nova didn‚Äôt reply immediately. She looked out the window, not at the street outside but at something in the unseen far distance.

‚ÄúGone.‚Äù

Jeridan didn‚Äôt like the sound of that.

‚ÄúWhat kind of ship is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúA Vega Class All-Purpose.‚Äù

Nova pulled out a communicator and hit a button. A hologram of the ship appeared over the table, turning slowly. He and Negasi studied the large, wedge-shaped vessel. The engines had been souped-up judging from the size of the thrusters, and Jeridan noticed a couple of extra gun turrets and torpedo tubes that didn‚Äôt come in the factory model.

It was a beauty.

Jeridan woke up a little. He‚Äôd captained half a dozen ships over his career, most of them someone else‚Äôs. He had begun to think of the *New Endeavor* as his own, until the bank brutally reminded him who the real owner was.

That still hurt. She had been a great ship.

But the *Antikythera* was on a whole other level. Piloting a ship like her would be a pleasure.

No, an honor.

He studied all those extra weapon systems. This woman was expecting trouble.

That tempered his enthusiasm.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see the specs,‚Äù Negasi said, his bloodshot eyes suddenly focused, professional.

Lines of text and several blueprints appeared. Jeridan had been right. This was a souped-up model. Capable of 1.93 light years a day, a hell of an acceleration on thrusters, state-of-the-art computer, and bristling with weapons.

‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù Jeridan admitted. Negasi nodded, then rubbed his neck like it hurt him. Jeridan vaguely remembered one of those guys giving his friend a karate chop from behind.

‚ÄúCan you fly one of these?‚Äù Nova asked.

‚ÄúI can fly anything.‚Äù Jeridan said. ‚ÄúAnd my buddy here is the best gunner in the Orion Arm.‚Äù

Nova studied him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard that about you two. It‚Äôs pretty much the only good thing I have heard.‚Äù

Jeridan grinned. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt heard we‚Äôre the best chessboxers in three systems?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Who beat you up?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one. We beat them up. What‚Äôs the mission?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a tech scavenger.‚Äù

Negasi turned to her, suddenly a lot more interested than before. ‚ÄúWhat are you after?‚Äù

‚ÄúA beacon station. Some juicy stuff there if we can get it.‚Äù

Jeridan and Negasi looked each other in the eye for a moment. They‚Äôd been working together for so long they could almost read each other‚Äôs minds.

‚ÄúCivilian or government?‚Äù Jeridan asked her.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you if you sign on.‚Äù

Jeridan‚Äôs heart fluttered. After the Galactic Civil War, some systems had managed to hold on for a century or two before finally slipping into chaos. Many of their installations were abandoned, with technology still intact that was rare or even unknown, even on worlds as advanced as Sagitta Prime. The lost tech they might find could be worth a fortune.

Or the place could be stripped to its girders. Most of the old installations got scavenged centuries ago as the planets tried to claw their way from the brink of falling into the Stone Age. Some hadn‚Äôt made it. Jeridan and Negasi had been to some of those planets. They had barely gotten out in one piece.

‚ÄúIf we sign on, I will be recognized as captain,‚Äù Jeridan said.

That brought him a lot more rights and power. If he had to work for someone else, at least he was going to have his rightful status.

‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù

‚ÄúStandard danger pay, plus 20% of the take and 25 cubic meters of your cargo hold,‚Äù Jeridan stated.

The woman frowned. ‚ÄúDanger pay? We‚Äôre not going into danger.‚Äù

‚ÄúTech scavengers are always going into danger, and you‚Äôre going into something pretty bad if you aren‚Äôt going through the Spacers Union to hire a crew. That pay rate starts the minute we sign with you.‚Äù

Nova cocked her head and studied them. ‚ÄúAll right, but only ten percent of the take.‚Äù

‚ÄúFifteen.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwelve and a half, or I find another beaten up crew who are a few credits away from the street.‚Äù

Negasi put his arms back on the table and rested his head on them.

‚ÄúI have a bad feeling about this,‚Äù he mumbled.

Nova turned to him. ‚ÄúI need your astronavigator too. What‚Äôs her name?‚Äù

‚ÄúCassie, and she already got a job with a cargo freighter. She‚Äôs a couple of light years away by now,‚Äù Negasi said, then belched. ‚ÄúNo sense of adventure.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you an astronavigator as well as a gunner?‚Äù

Negasi raised his head again.

‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôm an accredited xenoanthropologist and I just happen to know someone‚Äîor more specifically some*thing*‚Äîwho will be the best astronavigator you ever met.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat species?‚Äù Nova asked.

‚ÄúS‚Äôouzz. I met it in town a few days back. They don‚Äôt like to speak much, but it needed help finding a place to stay that could accommodate its species needs. They don‚Äôt forget a favor, and I know it needs a job.‚Äù

Nova frowned. ‚ÄúS‚Äôouzz? I thought they were locally extinct.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo did I. It says it‚Äôs the only one of its kind it knows of. The S‚Äôouzz home world is in the Beta Quadrant, so it‚Äôs not getting back there anytime soon. It says when the jump gates went offline near the end of the Galactic Civil War, only a few S‚Äôouzz were in this quadrant, and their numbers have been dwindling ever since. Now it‚Äôs dwindled down to one.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt the old government use them as astronavigators?‚Äù Jeridan asked. History wasn‚Äôt his strong point, but the race had been famous.

Negasi nodded, rubbing his neck again. ‚ÄúThey have a natural talent for it. They‚Äôre loners, though. Best let me handle this.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you can get it on the same terms I offered you, we can leave tonight,‚Äù Nova said.

Jeridan remembered the police hovercar. ‚ÄúHurry up and find him, Negasi.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù his copilot said, struggling to his feet.

‚ÄúAnd then call me and help me load our ‚Ä¶ possessions.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Negasi staggered out the door.

Nova turned to Jeridan.

‚ÄúWhat are you putting in my hold?‚Äù

Jeridan looked her in the eye. This could be a potential deal breaker. Best to cut to the chase.

‚ÄúPart of the terms of our agreement is that you don‚Äôt get to ask.‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing sentient or chemically unstable?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said and sighed ‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ confirming what Jeridan suspected. Nova Bradford was just as desperate as they were.

‚ÄúLooks like we have a deal,‚Äù Jeridan said.

Nova hesitated, then nodded. ‚ÄúWe do. My hovercar‚Äôs outside. There are some things I need to pick up for the trip.‚Äù

Jeridan drained the last of his apple juice/coffee, made a face, and got up.

For the next couple of hours they flitted about town, Nova flying the hovercar above the skyline and away from ground traffic, landing on the roofs of commercial buildings so they could go down to various shops and pick out electronic gear and spare parts. Nova seemed to know her business, and Jeridan grew a bit more confident this mission would end better than his last one.

Then they shot out of town, passing over algae ponds and a factory where the gunk was processed and mixed with flavors, vitamins, and texturizers into any type of food one might want. There were some honest-to-goodness farms and ranches somewhere on this planet too, but even when he was flush, Jeridan rarely had the money for authentic food.

They stopped at an isolated house by some algae ponds where a couple of men with flechette rifles met them, gave Jeridan the once over, and handed Nova a small box. Nothing was said, and Jeridan sure as hell wasn‚Äôt going to add to the conversation.

Nova hit the bottom thrusters, took the hovercar up to 500 meters, and shot back toward Fletcher City and its spaceport.

That was when they came after them.

Jeridan first spotted them as three dots in the sky in the direction of the city. The dots grew, resolving into hovercars, flying in a triangular formation straight for them.

Nova rose a hundred meters to avoid them, and the unidentified hovercars did the same.

‚ÄúWhat are those idiots‚Äî‚Äù

Nova cut off her question as a pulse charge shot out of the lead hovercar. Nova banked and the shimmering clump of energy, enough to short out their engine and send them falling to their deaths, hummed past.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Nova said.

She made a sharp turn and hit the power, zipping back the way they had come. Jeridan glanced over his shoulder. The three vehicles were gaining on them.

The lead vehicle fired again. Another miss, but closer this time. Nova handed him a pair of binoculars.

‚ÄúSee who it is.‚Äù

Jeridan punched a button to bring it to 100x magnification and zoomed in on the lead vehicle. The autofocus stabilized the image, and he got a clear view of the two men in the cab. Young men, well dressed, their faces covered with bruises.

‚ÄúUh-oh.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre they the guys who beat you up?‚Äù

Another pulse hissed by, close enough that their engine faltered and they dropped fifty meters before Nova could stabilize again.

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt beat us up. We beat them up!‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care who beat up who. How did they find you?‚Äù

Nova pulled a scanner out of her pocket and passed it over Jeridan. It beeped when she passed it behind his shoulder.

Jeridan reached around, felt a lump on his flight suit, and pulled a small adhesive tab off it.

‚ÄúOh great, a locator,‚Äù Nova said as he tossed it overboard. ‚ÄúWhy did you pick a fight with a bunch of aristocrats?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you know they‚Äôre aristocrats?‚Äù

Another pulse shot by.

‚ÄúBecause they‚Äôre the only ones on this uptight world who could get away with having a pulse cannon on their hovercar.‚Äù

Jeridan looked over his shoulder. They were still gaining.

‚ÄúGot anything to fire back with?‚Äù he asked.

Nova glared at him. ‚ÄúDo I look like an aristocrat to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrowning at me like that, you look like every employer I ever had,‚Äù Jeridan said and laughed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre unbelievable.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait until you get to know me.‚Äù

The pulse cannon fired again, scoring a direct hit on the rear of the hovercar. The engine seized, and they hurtled down toward the algae ponds far below.

1kzzo06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kzzo06/could_a_friendship_still_grow_after_3_years_of/,Could a friendship still grow after 3 years of working side by side? (Both 25M),"Hi everyone,

I (25M, calm and sensitive) have been working with a colleague around my age for about 3‚Äì4 years now. We started at the company at the same time and have always worked well together ‚Äì professionally, respectfully, and reliably. But up until now, everything between us has stayed strictly work-related.

Lately, I‚Äôve found myself wanting to get to know him better outside of work ‚Äì mainly because I could really imagine building a friendship with him. I‚Äôm not focused on anything romantic, though I‚Äôd be open if something ever developed naturally. But honestly, a sincere and real friendship would mean just as much to me.

What draws me to him isn‚Äôt just our teamwork ‚Äì it‚Äôs how he reacts in certain situations. For example, when others jokingly tease him, he goes quiet. To me, that feels like a sensitive side not everyone notices ‚Äì and that makes him interesting on a deeper level.

We recently followed each other on Instagram, and he followed me back right away. Since then, I‚Äôve noticed some subtle shifts ‚Äì like him using emojis in our Teams chats, which he never did before. Maybe it‚Äôs nothing, but I‚Äôm someone who notices small changes like that.

From what I‚Äôve seen, he‚Äôs into football, enjoys going out, traveling, and probably gaming too. But we‚Äôve never really talked about personal things ‚Äì it‚Äôs always been strictly work-related.

This week, I tried inviting him for a coffee at work, but it didn‚Äôt work out due to timing. A few friends told me I should just send him a casual message on Instagram instead ‚Äì maybe something like a funny meme to break the ice. Others suggest I just ask him directly at work to join me for a lunch break sometime.

Then again, some people are just naturally reserved ‚Äì and to add to that, according to some office gossip, he might have a girlfriend. But honestly, since we started following each other on Instagram, something in his behavior changed ever so slightly. As mentioned, he now adds emojis to his messages ‚Äì which he didn‚Äôt before. Small, but noticeable to me.

A good friend of mine (who is gay as well) told me I should consider speaking to him more directly ‚Äì before I get lost in overthinking and speculation. He had a similar experience once and regrets not acting on it. He also reminded me that just because someone has a girlfriend doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôre fully sure of their own orientation. Sometimes people go along with expectations because of social pressure.

But I‚Äôm not trying to assume or expect anything. I just want to find out ‚Äì honestly and at eye level ‚Äì if there‚Äôs a chance to get to know him better after all these years working together. Whether something deeper ever happens is secondary. What I really want is a genuine, human connection.

I‚Äôm not someone with a huge social circle. I have about 2 to 5 close friends ‚Äì some I‚Äôve known for over 10 years, others I‚Äôve met through gaming or social media. It‚Äôs hard for me to build new connections, but I deeply value meaningful, personal bonds ‚Äì even in everyday life.

My questions for you: 

‚Ä¢ How would you approach someone you‚Äôve only had a professional relationship with so far? 

‚Ä¢ Would it be okay to casually message him on Instagram (e.g., start with a meme or something like: ‚ÄúHey, random question ‚Äì do you game? I think I overheard you mention something in the office once‚Ä¶ or was that [Colleague X]? üòÖ‚Äù)? 

‚Ä¢ Or would it be better to ask him in person at the office to grab lunch, without making it too heavy? 

‚Ä¢ How do you personally deal with uncertainty when trying to connect with someone ‚Äì especially if you‚Äôre more reserved? 

‚Ä¢ And how do you even tell if someone likes you in a friendly (or possibly more) way? 

‚Ä¢ One last thing: I often feel like he waits for me to make the first move before he responds. Why might that be?

Thanks so much for reading. I‚Äôd really appreciate any honest thoughts ‚Äì especially from those who approach people with the same kind of care and caution I do.",1,1748705035.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1kzzne7,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kzzne7/does_ge_fqk2j_under_sink_water_filter_truly_meet/,Does GE FQK2J Under Sink Water Filter Truly Meet High Filtration Standards? Review,"The **GE FQK2J Under Sink Water Filter Replacement** has been a trusty companion in my kitchen for several months now. As someone who drinks gallons of water daily and depends on clean water for cooking, coffee brewing, and everything in between, this filter set has had a crucial role in keeping my water pristine. With its dual-flow filtration system, twist-and-lock design, and NSF/ANSI certification, I can see why it‚Äôs popular with so many people. But perfection isn‚Äôt part of the package, and I‚Äôve discovered a few bumps during regular use.

**Design and Installation: Ease of Use Meets Practicality**  
The twist-and-lock mechanism of this water filter makes installation and replacement ridiculously simple. I'm not the handiest person, yet it took me less than 10 minutes to replace the filters without hunting down a toolbox. No spills, no mess‚Äîjust an easy swap. Its compact dimensions (2.5"" x 2.5"" x 10"") fit perfectly under my sink, even with my crowded cabinet of cleaning supplies and random junk. One quirk, however, is that it feels slightly snug when operating with certain filtration systems like the Pfister Clarify. It fits, but you‚Äôll need to nudge it into place.  

**Check [GE FQK2J] price on Amazon.**

**Water Quality and Performance: Impressively Effective**  
This water filter thoroughly impressed me in filtering out unpleasant flavors, odors, and impurities. Pairing it with my GXK285JBL filtration system, I immediately noticed that murky tap water transformed into crystal-clear perfection. My coffee tasted bolder, and gone were the days of detecting a faint metallic aftertaste in my drinking water. The carbon block material works hard to remove sediment, rust, and chlorine contaminants, which for me, is a lifesaver. However, I did encounter one minor hiccup ‚Äì if water pressure drops below 35 psi, the flow tends to slow down considerably. This could irritate households with inconsistent water pressure.

**Durability and Lifespan: Reliable but Could Be Longer**  
Each filter can handle up to 300 gallons or last six months before replacement is necessary. For my small household of three, this timeline fits comfortably into our routine. However, my coworker, who has a family of five, did mention that their filter lifespan seemed to dwindle a bit faster. If you cook a lot or have a big household, factor in frequent replacements. While it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, those six-month intervals might feel closer to four or five for larger families.  

**Benefits**  
- User-friendly installation with twist-and-lock simplicity.  
- Superior filtration performance, eliminating over 15 contaminants.  
- Slim design fits effortlessly in tight spaces.  
- Works with multiple GE filtration models, extending compatibility.

**Negatives**  
- Flow rate slows with lower water pressure.  
- Six-month lifespan might feel short for heavy-use households.  
- Can feel snug when paired with certain alternative systems.  

**Other Options**  
The market has a few competing under-sink water filtration systems worth mentioning. For instance, the Whirlpool WHKF-DUF is a sturdy challenger that provides comparable filtration quality but lacks the same simple installation. Another rival, the APEC WFS-1000, offers a slightly higher filter capacity at 500 gallons. However, its upfront cost and maintenance are significantly steeper. The **GE FQK2J**, with its twist-and-lock feature and ease of use, remains a more seamless choice for users like me who prefer a less high-maintenance option.

**Value for Money**  
This filter is an excellent middle-ground purchase. While it doesn‚Äôt skimp on performance, it doesn‚Äôt overreach in price either. Compared to some competitors that either charge a premium or don't provide the same NSF/ANSI certifications, this system balances quality and affordability with finesse. If you prioritize clean, crisp water without needing to overpay for complicated setups or superior capacity filters, you'll find this system hits the sweet spot.

1kzzlqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1kzzlqm/could_i_roast_better_than_local_roasters/,Could I roast better than local roasters?,"Ok so I was in Canada a few months ago and bought some beans from a roaster called Rogue Wave. I got a few samples as well so altogether I had 6 different beans. Every single one of them was mind blowing. Sweet, fruity, acidic. And no bitterness. 

I don't know how common it is, but I honestly just don't like much bitterness in my coffee (I drink espresso). I got into coffee from specialty light roasts and that's really what I like. Don't like the traditional bitter style at all, don't like the chocolatey flavors, nutty, caramel, etc. They all just taste burnt, smokey, or bitter to me.

So after coming home (Israel), I started looking for similar beans to Rogue Wave, but now about 7 roasters later, I'm so disappointed. Even the lightest roasts here I can't seem to extract without a good bit of bitterness. It's not terrible, just not anywhere close to Rogue Wave level.

I think part of the problem is that there are no roasters here that **only** do light roasts, like Rogue Wave, because it's not such a big thing here, maybe not enough customers.

Anyways, after all this background, I'm wondering if there's any merit in getting into roasting and seeing if I can do better. I don't know why Rogue Wave beans are so much better than anything here, but I'm guessing I would have a very hard time doing better than local roasters with years of experience and professional equipment. But still I wanted to ask you guys if that's true? Is there some secret that only a few roasters know that no one else knows? Because clearly there's more to it than just roasting the bean lightly. Either they are just sourcing far superior beans, or there is some other magic going on. 

So is there any chance I could roast my own beans and get the sweet, acidic, fruity flavors out of the beans without bitterness, something no local roaster seems to be able to do? And if you do think that's possible, how long and how much money would I be down the roasting rabbit hole before I see the first rays of light?

(And no, if anyone was wondering, Rogue Wave does not ship to Israel, so that's not an option.)",3,1748704875.0,roasting,9,0.71,False

1kzzjoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1kzzjoo/smooth_recovery_story_40f/,Smooth recovery story - 40F,"I am now just over 4 weeks post op (30th April 2025) in UK. I was very freaked out reading posts on here prior to my surgery so just wanted to post about my recovery, which I was lucky with and it went very smoothly (no bleeding). 

Surgery day - Had op first thing in the morning (8am) was back in my room by 10am and starving! Ate my ‚Äúlunch‚Äù of a sandwich, soup and coffee (both of which I left to go cold first). No issues eating, just chewed very well. No pain except a very minor sore throat, but assume this was from the meds they gave me during surgery. Discharged at 1.30pm. Went home and was sat chatting to my friend in the garden for the afternoon whilst drinking lots of fluids. Ate dinner with no issues. 

Days 1-2 - still minimal pain. Only took paracetamol and ibuprofen on a schedule. Used humidifier in the night and lots of fluids. Was eating a normal diet (as recommended by my surgeon) - just made sure it was lukewarm at most and that I chewed really well.

Days 3-4 - these were my most painful days as I would intermittently get a sharp pain shooting into my ears. Luckily only happened every now and then and didn‚Äôt last more than 20mins or so. At these times pain would be a 6-7/10, but rest of the time was around a 3/10.

Days 5-7 - scabs how now fully formed and were a little uncomfortable, especially with eating. Pain still only 2-3/10 most of the time, 4-5/10 during eating and for a short while after. Still eating a normal diet and drinking lots of fluids. Sticking to paracetamol and ibuprofen on a schedule. 

Day 8 - No pain meds needed from this day. Pain very low level, and eating much easier.

Days 9-12 - feeling pretty much normal, with only mild discomfort due to the scabs. Staying hydrated helped with this hugely. Able to do all normal activities and even some moderate gardening. 

Day 13 - back in gym (but took it easy) - no issues. 

Day 15 - flew to Switzerland for the weekend to see my friends (with the ok from my surgeon). 

My scabs took a good 3-3.5 weeks to go away and I can still feel what I think is some scar tissue slightly on the right hand side? But overall feels a million times better than before surgery! My tonsils were huge after so many infections (surgeon told me they were basically just full of scar tissue hence their size). Have my post op follow up next week, but feeling good so expect all is well. 

Tips - humidifier for during the night, sip water CONSTANTLY when awake. Take painkillers on a set schedule (I would have an alarm go off in the night so I could make sure I had cover at all times) I also bought sachets of something something called Gelforte (from Amazon), which I would take before bed - seemed to help form a protective barrier and stop my throat drying out while I slept.

I was recommended to eat a normal diet from the start and think this really helped, but listen to what your surgeon says on this. I just left things to cool first and chewed thoroughly. Nothing spicy, sour or sharp though. Prioritise protein for healing. 

Good luck to anyone about to have their surgery!

1kzziu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/YoungerGirl4OlderMen/comments/1kzziu1/41_m4f_california_i_wonder_if_people_would_assume/,41 [M4F] #California - I wonder if people would assume we are a daddy/daughter if I took you to Disneyland with me...,"Why go on an awkward coffee date, surrounded by people trying to take their ""daily coffee selfie"".. when having some fantasy fun at the happiest place on earth could be far more exciting?..

Since discovering some of these kinky reddit communities. I've been a little more curious to explore the DDLG kink and meet someone who shares my curiosities with this kink.. and I figured, why not go BIG or go home! I say planning a fun Disneyland day or weekend could be an incredibly exhilarating environment to indulge ourselves with this fantasy.

I'm not saying we run around the park acting too blatantly obvious or get ourselves into any kind of trouble. I just wonder if our age gap will make people assume we are having a daddy/daughter weekend trip instead of a couples weekend trip.

If someone does think that, then maybe we won't correct them.. They'll just see me as an affectionate father spending time with his adorable daughter.. but will they start to notice if we're being a little too affectionate?.. Will they notice if I'm holding you a little too close on certain rides?.. or if my hand lingers a little too long on your lower back while waiting in lines?.. Will some people back at the hotel wonder why our room only has one bed?

I know this idea is pretty spontaneous and a bit ambitious, but it could be a great way to meet that perfectly adventurous and kinky new partner. 

A little bit about who I am:

I'm not married and I dont have any kids. I‚Äôd say I lean more on the introverted side who also enjoys some outdoor adventures with the right person. I'm more of the guy petting the dog at the party than the guy who's trying to be the center of attention. I'm easygoing, and emotionally chill by nature. I don‚Äôt do drama, yelling, or play mind games. If anything, I‚Äôm probably the guy cracking an inappropriate joke just to diffuse tension or lighten the mood. I'm a pretty calm presence in a chaotic world.

I absolutely love animals. If we end up together, are biggest argument will probably be how many pets is too many... 

As for my description, I am a bit on the shorter side at 5'7 with a pretty fit build, good hygiene and a hairy dad chest.. So it would probably be more believable if my girl was a bit more on the shorter and petite side.. but it's absolutely not a deal breaker if our physical attributes are nothing alike.

I can absolutely enjoy a lazy day indoors watching movies, tv, playing videogames or boardgames and cooking up a nice meal while we're all cuddled up. I also enjoy going out on nature hikes, spontaneous roadtrips, camping and fishing trips. 

As for the kink side of things (Because It Matters):

To me, sexual compatibility isn‚Äôt the last thing we talk about, it‚Äôs part of the foundation. I don‚Äôt want either of us to feel like we have to keep our desires tucked away. If it‚Äôs something you‚Äôve fantasized about, chances are I‚Äôve either explored it, or I‚Äôm game to try it with the right partner.

I‚Äôm dominant-leaning and very kink-friendly. I am also very affectionate, attentive and caring with my partner. I like to say I know how to show a girl respect on the streets and juuust the right amount of disrespect in the sheets.. I am also a huge cuddler, so you'd definitely get spoiled with plenty of cuddles, massages and affection around me.

I'm looking for someone genuine, emotionally intelligent, funny in her own weird way, and ideally a little kinky under that sweet exterior. You love animals, nature, and deep connections. You‚Äôre Maybe a little nerdy, a bit tomboyish, a lot curious. Maybe you‚Äôre introverted too, or maybe you just want a guy who sees the quiet moments as just as important as the wild ones. 

I live in Southern California and happy to talk with someone local. However, I'm all for making a connection with someone who lives further away. As it turns out, I have been looking for a significant change and make a move out of California.. go enjoy some new surroundings around Oregon, Colorado or somewhere else with more trees, lakes and peacefulness.. and less traffic, crowds and stress. 

I'm down for sharing pics whenever you're comfortable. I also know that fakes and scams are all over the place on here these days.. so I'd prefer to share some live selfies and even do a video call or so to prove we are both legit and ready to try something like this.

It's fun to be spontaneous and a bit impulsive, but I'm also not trying to rush anything. Let's talk and see how we vibe.. and we can potentially plan a fun Disney trip from there.

If this idea excites you, feel free to hit me up. Let me know your age, gender, location, a brief description of yourself and your favorite ride at Disney.",1,1748704675.0,YoungerGirl4OlderMen,0,1.0,False

Toyota and others are developing systems that split water into hydrogen **on demand** to avoid using high-pressure hydrogen tanks. That‚Äôs cool engineering. But it‚Äôs still a **hydrogen engine**, not a perpetual-motion magic trick.

A friend showed me this tool they built for themselves at work. We were catching up over coffee and they casually mentioned they‚Äôd stopped manually drafting sales proposals, contracts, and technical documents.

Naturally, I asked, ‚Äú*Wait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?*‚Äù

They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.

They typed:

>‚Äú*Generate a proposal for X company, similar to the one we did for Y ‚Äî include updated scope and pricing*.‚Äù

And then just like that‚Ä¶ a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates.¬†

They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.

Now?

* You can ask questions inside documents, like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs missing here?‚Äù¬†
* Search across old RFPs, contracts, and templates ‚Äî even PDFs
* Auto-fill forms using context from previous conversations
* Edit documents by prompting the AI like you‚Äôre chatting with a teammate

I'm using them for c-PTSD, chronic pain, and burnout. I also am bipolar, ADHD, potentially on th autism spectrum. The infusions were great. My blood pressure was never affected by the Ketamine and I've never had a bad trip. I actually really enjoy listening to music with lyrics, even they they get very distorted, they still aren‚Äôt frightening. I would get VERY high with the IVs. Full disassociation, some visuals, time distortion, etc. I remember one time being so disassociated during the IV that I wasn't sure I'd know how to come back to being in my body. And I know the nasal ket won't be like that, and I'm not looking for it to be.

The ketamine infusions seemed to help a lot, but are so expensive. I spoke with my psychiatrist and he prescribed nasal Ketamine, 135mg/ml, 4-5 sprays per nostril, 3x per week. I don't know my exact weight because I used to have an eating disorder, but I think I'm around 180. My question is, I don't really feel much when I do it. Like, just a little wobbly for maybe 30 minutes. I've always done the full 5 sprays because I never feel much. I do a spray in each nostril, wait 3 minutes, then do the next spray in each nostril. It does seem like it's helping a little bit with energy and nightmares, but it just generally doesn't feel like it's doing much. I know it is not nearly as strong as the IVs, but it still feels so, so light. I think part of it is also me learning how to use the nasal spray, which I searched on this sub yesterday and will try my next dose to see if it helps. 

I don't do recreational drugs or even drink coffee or alcohol, so I'm pretty straight-laced. Perhaps because of that, I'm feeling a lot of anxiety about asking my dr if I could try a higher dose. I'm worried it will come across like I just want to do more drugs. Like it's going to sound to him like I'm trying to get the same level of high with the nasal spray as I got with the IV, even though that's not the case.

I have no issue with taking Ketame, and I know logically that it's a medication and not a drug. It's like... I personally know it's a medication and I'm taking it as such, but what if my Psych doesn't believe me??

Is the dose I'm taking already high? Is there room to go up? Do I just ask my dr if we could up the dose a bit? Am I making a big deal about this in my head and it'll actually just be fine? I have my next appointment on the 10th and I'm ALSO afraid that I'm going to be so nervous and try to explain too much and then he's going to get the wrong impression from my anxiety and take that as drug-seeking behavior.

I'm trying to get a realistic idea of the road to opening day, and I'll be scouring this subreddit but if anyone has anything else to share it is appreciated!

Without giving too much away (I haven't found anything quite like this anywhere, certainly not anywhere nearby though I'm sure it exists somewhere):
---Will be serving custom-blended, non-alcoholic beverages, both energy and non-energy, but probably going to stay away from coffee for the most part (coffee is saturated here and while energy blends are too, I feel like my theme is enough to push me above others but atm I can't think of how to extend that to coffee).
---Niche theme, but food good/appealing enough to stand out to those not into the theme
---Bay County, Florida
---Hot & Grab and Go food options
---Vegetarian (possibly vegan) options alongside carnivorous ones
---Thematic names for familiar dishes 


Things I think work in my favor:
---Extensive restaurant experience (FOH & BOH)
---Original, fun idea/theme
---Familiarity with varied dietary needs/preferences
---Existing LLC in good standing with the state 
---Current ServSafe
---Tool savvy, ready to get my hands dirty to make this happen faster
---Realistic view of profitability/workload (don't expect a paycheck for the first year, no real profits for 18 months at best, long hours, working when others are playing, etc)
---Trusted and honest group to trial recipes
---Strong support system


Things I know work against me:
---Currently no capital
---Poor personal credit
---Lack of local commissaries (1-2 in the county, going to call local churches as well)
---No vehicle capable of pulling a trailer, so will either need a new vehicle and trailer or a truck
---Family (kids, and my partner can't reduce his hours or we won't be able to pay bills HOWEVER I have reliable childcare for the youngest, my 2 oldest homeschool and can help, and the 1 remaining will be in school)

Clearly she was struggling when we met so I waited, years later seems like not much has changed with her.

A few months ago I asked her to go on a date just the two of us and she immediately shut me down. Said she doesn't think she'll ever be in a relationship. 

It's very clear she's struggling with something but doesn't want to tell me. I know for a fact she ended up not graduating school & has a crappy job.
I own a house and have a career, and really like her. It seems like a no brainer that I could give her a better life then she can give herself.

Yet, I've brought flowers to her work multiple times, brought her coffees, cookies and get rejected everytime.

Last night I went to her work, I was kind to her like always. Asked if she would just come over to my place when she was done to talk and she started crying.
Literally no clue why, I've never gotten mad when she rejected me. I also texted her this morning and she opened it but didn't answer me

No normal person wants to be single forever with no good reasoning.. let alone not kiss anyone or go on a date for 25 years. Especially when you're a pretty women who could probably get anyone you want. So I know there's something wrong, but yet she won't even give me a shot to help.

**Why This Pick?**

I just can‚Äôt back the Mariners right now, friends ‚Äì their offense is severely lacking having lost 5 of their last 6 games (‚Ä¶which includes a rough shutout loss to the Nationals). In addition, as soon as I saw Bryce Miller‚Äôs (5.22 ERA) name on the starting list, I knew I was rolling with the Twins. Bailey Ober (3.41 ERA, 4-1) has been far more reliable having allowed just 7 runs over a staggering 26 hits across his last 5 outings. And while Minnesota has taken a few tough losses lately, they‚Äôre coming off a steep 12-6 win over Seattle just yesterday. I say the Twins keep the momentum going with Ober on the mound and grab another road victory here.

First of all, I want to thank everyone for the amazing response to my previous post. Your feedback, support, and enthusiasm mean a lot to me and have been a huge motivation to keep improving this addon. It's great to see this community so engaged!

I'm back with an update to the Nuvio Streaming Addon for Stremio.

After working on improvements based on your feedback, I'm releasing version 0.3.0. This update includes several new features that should improve the addon's functionality and customization options.

# What's New in v0.3.0:

* New Providers Added - Added HiAnime for anime fans.
* Provider Customization - You can now choose which providers to use in the configuration page
* Quality Selection - Set minimum quality preferences for each provider (480p, 720p, 1080p)
* Performance Improvements - Backend optimizations for better stability

# Reality Check:

I want to be transparent: this is a scraper addon that relies on external providers. These providers can change their sites or shut down at any time without notice. While I'll try to maintain it as long as possible:

* No Long-Term Guarantees - Providers may stop working unexpectedly
* Limited Resources - As a solo developer, I fix things when I can
* Educational Project - This addon is primarily a personal project

# About this addon:

Now includes six diverse providers including specialized options for anime fans and multi-source capabilities. The addon attempts to find streams when available from these sources, with some providers supporting 4K, HDR, and Dolby Vision content. Personal cookie configuration remains the recommended way to get the best experience.

# Who's This For?

This addon is primarily for Stremio users who:

1. Prefer direct streaming links as an alternative to debrid services
2. Understand the nature of scrapers and that public sources can be unreliable
3. Are willing to configure by setting up a personal cookie for the best experience

# Personal Cookie Token Setup (Extremely Recommended)

>Why personalize? Without personalization, you share limited bandwidth with other users and are restricted to smaller file sizes.

# New Provider Customization

With v0.3.0, you can now customize your experience in several ways:

1. Select which providers to use - Disable providers you don't need
2. Set quality preferences - Choose minimum quality for compatible providers
3. Improve performance - Disabling unused providers can speed up results

# A Note on Regional Providers (LATAM)

Many of you have requested providers from Latin America, I want to address this:

The challenge with Most providers is that they require proxy connections to work properly. I've been researching VPS (Virtual Private Server) solutions that would handle these region-specific requests efficiently. Adding these diverse sources would significantly improve the addon's resilience when other providers go down.

This is part of my roadmap for future development - I'm gradually working toward implementing the necessary infrastructure as resources become available. In the meantime, I'm focusing on optimizing the current providers while planning for these regional expansions.

If you're interested in helping with this aspect of development, your expertise or resources would accelerate these improvements for the entire community. Collaboration on this front would benefit users across multiple regions.

Just a reminder that even with these additions, no scraper addon can guarantee permanent availability. If you have technical expertise in this area and want to contribute, feel free to reach out.

# Where to find it:

# Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: How reliable is this addon long-term?  
A: As a scraper addon, its reliability depends entirely on the external providers. They can change or disappear at any time, and when that happens, I'll try to update or replace them when possible, but there are no guarantees.

Q: What's the difference between personalized and non-personalized usage?  
A: Non-personalized users share limited bandwidth and can only access streams under 9GB from certain providers. Personalized users get their own 100GB monthly quota and access to all quality levels.

Q: Does this addon use torrents or P2P technology?  
A: No. This addon only scrapes direct HTTP streams from websites. It does not use P2P or torrents.

Q: Why do some streams not work?  
A: Providers can change their websites or go offline at any time. When this happens, streams will stop working until I update the addon.

Q: How often is the addon updated?  
A: As an indie developer with limited time, I update when I can. If a provider breaks, I'll try to fix it or find a replacement, but please be patient.

Q: Will more providers be added?  
A: I'm always looking for reliable providers to add. This update already adds two new ones.

If you encounter issues, you can DM me or comment below. Please understand that it may take time to find solutions or alternative providers.

We can't even go out to eat without him, accusing me of wanting to sleep with the waiter or making googly eyes at them, I'm almost scared to look up. if we're in the car and I look up and somebody's crossing the street he automatically thinks I'm checking them out and says I have eyes for everyone when I just don't understand where I'm supposed to look he's started telling me that this is just the type of female I am and that's just the way I am and I don't know if he's manipulating me into thinking I am a bad person. it's like walking on eggshells. I recently found out I was pregnant and when he gets drunk, he comes home and is extremely mean to me calls me names and has told me to get an abortion multiple times but then when he's sober he apologizes, tells me he loves me and says he doesn't know why he said that and is excited for the baby. Because of the way he has treated me. I have considered an abortion and now because of that he is accusing the baby of not being his when I have been faithful to him our entire relationship... he has constantly accused me of cheating our entire relationship when i have never cheated and have not done anything to make him think that way. Oh and today he called me a gold digger because i looked at him taking the money out of his wallet to pay for our coffees so he said ""thats all you care about.""

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free ‚Äúbeans‚Äù** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Steps:

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://swf3j.app.goo.gl/C9HgF)).

It was set up similar to a mall, but onna much smaller scale. I remember really liking the atmosphere and aesthetic of the place. Everything was made from dark wood and kind of rustic looking.  The lighting either was natural or came from laps with stained glass shades so it wasn‚Äôt overwhelming. It smelled really good too. Like coffee, plants (they had a lot of potted plants around) and incense. 

I passed by a woman in a wooden chair while I was looking around. She was wearing a dark blue suit, looked to be in her late 20s or early 30s and had short black hair in a ponytail. She got up and tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I could stay out of that particular area for a few minutes because she was being filmed for an announcement she had to make. She told me I could come back later if I wanted. I obliged and went to the far end of the walkway.

I recall seeing a small nook with a chair in it surrounded by vines hanging down. There were also pink, diamond shaped packets around the chair that smelled really good, like cinnamon but sweeter. I picked one up for a better look at it and found out it was a type of incense made by the people who owned the place. The words ‚ÄúThe Cloister‚Äù on the packet in fancy black lettering and I figured that was the name of the building I was in.

1kzyzwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMySpaceAI/comments/1kzyzwt/ground_your_style_the_art_of_defining_zones/,Ground Your Style: The Art of Defining Zones & Adding Warmth with Rugs,"Rugs are often the unsung heroes of interior design, the foundational pieces that can subtly or dramatically transform a space. More than just a soft covering for your floors, a well-chosen rug is a powerhouse: it can anchor a room, clearly define distinct zones, introduce essential warmth and texture, and inject a significant dose of your unique personality. This is particularly crucial in contemporary open-plan living spaces, where visual cues are paramount for creating a sense of order, flow, and designated purpose.

Let‚Äôs explore how to harness the versatile power of rugs to elevate your interior design from good to truly exceptional:

# 1. Define Zones in Open-Plan Spaces with Precision

In a large, open-concept room that serves multiple functions ‚Äì such as a combined living, dining, and kitchen area ‚Äì rugs are your most valuable allies. By strategically placing different rugs, you can visually demarcate each ""zone,"" creating a sense of separation and purpose without erecting physical walls.

* **Living Area:**¬†A large, inviting rug can define the primary seating area. Ideally, the front legs of your sofa and all accent chairs should rest comfortably on the rug, creating a cohesive conversational grouping.
* **Dining Area:**¬†A rug under the dining table and chairs not only defines the eating space but also adds a touch of formality or coziness. Ensure it‚Äôs large enough so that chairs remain on the rug even when pulled out.
* **Entryway/Foyer:**¬†A stylish runner or a smaller accent rug can create a welcoming transition into your home and define the entryway.
* **Reading Nook or Workspace:**¬†A smaller, distinct rug can carve out a cozy reading corner or a compact home office area within a larger room.

**Key Tip for Multi-Rug Harmony:**¬†When using multiple rugs in an open space, ensure there's a degree of visual harmony. They don't need to be identical (in fact, that can look monotonous), but they should complement each other. This can be achieved through a shared color palette, similar patterns (e.g., all geometric, or all organic), or related textures.

# 2. Anchor Your Furniture for Cohesion

One of the most common decorating mistakes is choosing a rug that‚Äôs too small for the space or the furniture grouping. An undersized rug can make a room feel disjointed and the furniture appear as if it's floating aimlessly. A correctly sized rug should be generous enough to sit under at least the front legs of your main furniture pieces in a seating arrangement (sofa, armchairs, coffee table).

* **Living Room Rule of Thumb:**¬†Aim for at least the front two legs of your sofa and chairs to be on the rug. For a more luxurious and unified feel, have all legs of the furniture on the rug, leaving a border of 12-18 inches of bare floor around the edges of the room.
* **Bedroom Bliss:**¬†In a bedroom, you can place a large rug underneath the entire bed and nightstands, extending at least 18-24 inches around the sides and foot. Alternatively, use runners on either side of the bed and perhaps a smaller one at the foot.

*A stylish open-plan living area where a large, textured rug clearly defines the seating zone and anchors the furniture.*

# 3. Inject Warmth, Texture, Color, and Personality

Rugs are a fantastic and relatively easy way to introduce or reinforce your desired color scheme and add a crucial layer of texture that makes a room feel significantly cozier, more inviting, and complete.

* **Color Power:**¬†A rug can be the starting point for your room's color palette, with its hues echoed in cushions, throws, artwork, and accessories. Alternatively, in a room with neutral walls and furniture, a bold, patterned, or brightly colored rug can become the stunning statement piece, injecting instant energy and personality.
* **Textural Richness:**¬†Consider the tactile experience. A plush, high-pile shag rug adds undeniable luxury and comfort, perfect for bedrooms or cozy living areas. A flatweave kilim or a natural fiber rug (like jute, sisal, or seagrass) can bring a more casual, organic, and earthy feel, ideal for high-traffic areas or coastal/bohemian styles.
* **Pattern Play:**¬†Don't shy away from patterns! Geometric designs, abstract motifs, traditional oriental patterns, or playful contemporary prints can all add immense visual interest. Just ensure the pattern's scale is appropriate for the room size and doesn't clash with other dominant patterns in the space.

# 4. Master Scale, Proportion, and Shape

The size and shape of your rug should always complement the size and shape of your room and its furnishings. This is critical for achieving a balanced and harmonious look.

* **Standard Sizes:**¬†Rugs come in standard sizes (e.g., 5x8, 8x10, 9x12 feet). Measure your space carefully and create a mock outline with painter's tape on the floor to visualize how a standard size will fit.
* **Room Proportions:**¬†In a long, narrow room, a runner or a rectangular rug that echoes the room's shape will work best. In a square room, a square or round rug can be effective.
* **Dining Room Specifics:**¬†As mentioned, the dining rug needs to be large enough so that all chair legs remain on the rug, even when guests are seated and pull their chairs out. A general rule is to add at least 24 inches to each side of your dining table's dimensions.
* **Beyond Rectangles:**¬†While rectangular rugs are most common, don't overlook other shapes. A round rug can soften a room with many hard angles or define a circular seating area. Organic or irregular shaped rugs can add a playful, modern touch.

Rugs are a truly transformative tool in your interior design arsenal. By choosing wisely based on function, style, and the principles of good design, and by placing them thoughtfully, you can dramatically improve the aesthetic appeal, comfort, and overall feel of any space in your home.",1,1748703314.0,DesignMySpaceAI,0,1.0,False

Hello everyone,

About 5 months ago, I bought a De'Longhi Specialista Arte. Unfortunately, it stopped grinding two weeks ago. I sent it to a repair center, but they couldn't fix it‚Äîso I‚Äôll be getting a refund.

Now I'm looking to buy a new setup: a semi-automatic espresso machine and an electric grinder.

I‚Äôve spent the last few days watching reviews, and honestly, I‚Äôm a bit disappointed. It seems like every machine in the \~500‚Ç¨ range has at least one major drawback.

I considered the Bambino, but I‚Äôm not really comfortable spending 350‚Ç¨ on something made with cheap materials and potentially difficult to repair. I also looked into the Gaggia Classic Pro, but I‚Äôm hesitant to spend over 400‚Ç¨ and then still need to mod it just to get good coffee.  
The HiBREW H10A also caught my eye, but I couldn‚Äôt find many reliable reviews on it.

Then I discovered the De‚ÄôLonghi ECP 3221, which is basically the European version of the 3420. It only costs around 110‚Ç¨, and from what I‚Äôve seen, the results aren‚Äôt *that* far off from a GCP‚Äîat a quarter of the price.

So here's the setup I'm currently considering:

* **De‚ÄôLonghi ECP 3221** ‚Äì 110‚Ç¨
* **Baratza Vario+** ‚Äì 400‚Ç¨



More details about me: 

* Location:  **Europe**
* Drink Frequency: **4-5 espresso per day**

What do you think of this combo? Any thoughts or suggestions?",1,1748702293.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a 32-year-old male, physically active and consistent in the gym 3‚Äì4 days a week for the past 3 years. My diet is high-protein mostly clean and intentional. But despite my healthy lifestyle, I‚Äôve been struggling with some issues that are affecting my quality of life:
My Habits:
I‚Äôve been watching porn for a long time at least twice a week, sometimes for extended sessions.During these sessions, I split my screen: one side plays a movie, and the other shows porn.I masturbate in intervals, trying to delay climax by switching focus to the movie, then returning to porn this cycle can repeat for a while until I finally finish.
Current Symptoms:
	‚Ä¢	Low sex drive
	‚Ä¢	Constant brain fog
	‚Ä¢	Lack of energy throughout the day (need 3 cups of coffee just to function)
	‚Ä¢	Occasional poor focus and motivation
Medical Info:
	‚Ä¢	Blood test showed low total testosterone: 2.55 ng/mL
	‚Ä¢	Diagnosed with secondary hypothyroidism
	‚Ä¢	Doctor recommended TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy), but:
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm hesitant to start TRT due to cost and long-term commitment
	‚Ä¢	I don‚Äôt feel ready to go that route yet
What I‚Äôm Looking For:
	‚Ä¢	Has anyone dealt with similar symptoms caused or worsened by porn use and sexual habits?
	‚Ä¢	Has anyone seen improvements by quitting porn or changing these behaviors?
	‚Ä¢	Are there effective alternatives to TRT?
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve read about Clomiphene (Clomid) and hCG ‚Äî they seem promising for stimulating natural T production, especially in cases of secondary hypogonadism.
	‚Ä¢	Any experience with these? Are they worth discussing with a doctor?

Last Friday, my husband went to the doctor and had a reading in the 170/100 range, which caused a lot of alarm. He does have extreme whitecoat syndrome, so hopefully, it hasn't been consistently that high. It wasn't that unexpected since everyone in his family is on blood pressure meds. He was already working out every day and eating mostly healthy to try to avoid hypertension. 

He started some meds, completely stopped vapping nicotine, switched out coffee for green tea, and maintained a low sodium high potassium diet. Over Memorial Day weekend, his readings got down to nearly 120/80. We thought we had it all figured out!

Since he's been back at work, his readings have gone back up in the 150/90 range while maintaining all the changes. Work has been extremely stressful and causes a lot of neck stiffness, which I just read can be a cause of high blood pressure. The long-term goal is to find a better job, but in the meantime, has anyone been able to fix their neck pain?

Main things we want to replace are: the rug, coffee table, side table, recliner, floating shelves, and entry wall drawers. 

The wall color will be the light yellow shown in the pictures. I *think* our style is eclectic... leaning more cottage than boho. 

We're fairly frugal, but willing to spend more on real quality... just not like $500+ for a coffee table. 

My partner is heavily attached to the couch, so we've been trying to find furniture that matches the arts & crafts/mission/stickley style to replace the side and coffee table with something smaller. Posted a collage of things I've saved that we're considering as options. 

We've thought about reupholstering the couch but also thinking of just changing the cushion covers out for a different color... and maybe replacing the pillows? 

We'd also like to keep the console, which according to Google is retro farmhouse?? If its feasible to paint it to help match better, we're open to that... but ideally there's a way to make it mesh as is. But if it's too much of an outlier/blocker to a clean look, we'd sell and replace the console. 

I typically prefer warm tones (other rooms are warm), but am thinking of going with blue shades here based on console color... or green. Put some rugs in the collage I'm considering. 

We'd like to hide as much clutter (shoes, entry drawers) as possible with good storage options.

Lastly, would love more plants but lighting isn't great and have to avoid anything that is toxic to cats!

-------------------------------

Many peoples feel unhappy with their weight. They try many things. Some peoples see this mushroom coffee, Ryze. They think, ""Maybe this coffee make me lose weight?"" Ryze have special mushrooms and other plants. People say it help with focus and make you feel good. But is it true it make body weight go down? I will look at what is inside Ryze. I will see how it maybe link to body weight. You can learn if Ryze can help your weight loss plan.

Understanding Ryze: More Than Just Coffee
-----------------------------------------

This Ryze is not just regular coffee like you drink in morning. It is coffee mix. It has coffee powder, yes, but also powder from special mushrooms. Companies make it to help peoples feel better in some ways. They say it gives good energy. They say it helps mind stay clear. Normal coffee just has coffee beans ground up. Ryze has other things added in with the coffee part. It is a drink people take for health ideas. Many people try it because it is different from just black coffee. It is like coffee with extra health things inside the cup.

Key Ingredients in Ryze and Their Potential Link to Weight Management
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ryze has some special things inside. One important type of thing is called adaptogens. These are plants or mushrooms. They can help body handle stress. Stress can make people eat more sometimes. Stress also makes body make more of a special thing called cortisol. Cortisol can tell body to keep fat, especially around the stomach part. If Ryze adaptogens help body handle stress better, maybe stress eating go down. Maybe body keep less fat because less stress. This is how the things in Ryze maybe connect to how much you weigh.

Mushrooms and Metabolism/Energy
-------------------------------

Other things in Ryze are mushrooms like Cordyceps or Turkey Tail. People study these mushrooms. Some studies think they can help your body use food for energy better. This is part of your metabolism. Maybe they also give you more energy to do things. If you have more energy, you can move your body more easily. You can do exercise or walk more steps. Doing more body moving helps your body burn energy. When body burns more energy than you eat, your weight can go down. So, these mushrooms might help you move more, which can help your body weight.

How Ryze Might Influence Weight Loss Efforts
--------------------------------------------

Think about how Ryze could help a little with losing weight. Maybe the things in Ryze can help your stomach feel full. If stomach feels full, you do not want to eat more food all the time. This can help stop you from eating snacks you do not need. Drinking a warm drink like Ryze can also make you feel satisfied. Sometimes you just want something in your hand or mouth. Drinking Ryze can do this. This can stop you from wanting to eat when you are not really hungry. It might help you eat less food in the day.

Boosting Energy for Activity
----------------------------

One way Ryze might help body weight is by giving you more energy. Some of the mushrooms in Ryze, like Cordyceps, people think they give more energy. If you have more energy, you feel like doing things. You feel like moving. Moving body is very important for losing weight. You must do exercise or walk or run. If Ryze makes you feel less tired, you can do more exercise. You can burn more energy. Burning more energy than you eat makes your body weight go down. So, feeling more energetic could help you do the necessary activity.

What the Evidence (and Users) Say About Ryze and Weight Loss
------------------------------------------------------------

Has anyone done a study on Ryze just for losing weight? Probably not. It is a company's drink mix, not a medicine. But scientists have studied the mushrooms in Ryze. Some studies on the mushrooms alone look at energy or stress. They do not usually look at body weight directly. What about people who drink Ryze? Some people write online that they lost weight when drinking Ryze. These are just stories from people. They are not science proof. Maybe they changed eating or exercise too. We cannot know for sure if Ryze made them lose weight.

Important Considerations Before Trying Ryze for Weight Loss
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you want to try Ryze for your weight, you must think first. It is important. Sometimes, things you eat or drink can make your body feel different. Ryze might give some people small problems. Maybe stomach feels bad. Maybe head hurts a little. Also, if you take medicine from a doctor, the things in Ryze could mix with your medicine. This could be bad. It is very important you talk to your doctor first. Tell your doctor you want to drink Ryze. Ask if it is okay for you. This is safe way to try new things.

It's Not a Standalone Solution
------------------------------

Many people look for one simple thing to lose weight. They want one drink or one pill. But Ryze is not this magic thing. It will not make you lose weight by itself. To lose weight, you must eat less food than your body uses. This is called eating less calories. You also must move your body more. This is called exercise. You need to do these two things together. Ryze cannot do this work for you. It might help you a little bit with energy or stress. But it is not a replacement for eating good food and moving your body every day.

The Verdict: Can You Rely on Ryze for Weight Loss?
--------------------------------------------------

So, can you trust Ryze to make your body weight go down? The answer is no, not really. Ryze has some good things in it, yes. It has mushrooms that might help with stress or give little energy. These things can help you live a healthy life. A healthy life includes eating good food and moving your body. These are the real ways to lose weight. Ryze can maybe be a little helper. But it is not the main worker. Do not think drinking Ryze means you do not need to eat less or exercise.

Conclusion: Ryze as Part of a Healthy Lifestyle
-----------------------------------------------

Final thinking on Ryze for body weight is simple. If you expect Ryze alone to make weight go down, it will not happen. It does not work like that. But maybe Ryze can help you feel better in other ways. Maybe less stress. Maybe little more energy. These things can help you keep doing your healthy food eating and body moving. These are important steps for weight going down. If you want to try Ryze, think of it as one small part of your health plan. Not the main plan. Always talk to doctor first before adding new things to your daily routine, especially if you have health problems or take medicine.

1kzyg4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kzyg4e/rf_a_man_goes_on_a_journey/,[RF] A Man Goes on A Journey,"The man had always liked sunrises. The yellow glow rising above the skyline carried an untouchable beauty few things had. Sitting up in bed, he smiled a bit as he watched the sky and trees collide (though he had no idea how there always seemed to be so many more than he saw when he went out). An amount of time passed as he looked out before his foggy mind re-asserted itself. He had to head out. After climbing stiffly out of bed he went through the usual morning routine before leaving the house. The door was left unlocked.

It was only a two-minute walk to the bus stop, which was on an arterial road heading from the nothing suburbs to the city centre. This early in the morning it was largely empty save a few homeless people slouched in doorways or under the awnings of the few shops trusting or lazy enough to leave them up overnight. The bus stop had an ad for haemorrhoid cream and a poster telling passengers not to be rude to the drivers.

The man perched uncomfortably on the thin slanted bench until a bus pulled in. He got on.

There were few people travelling this early in the day. Mostly it was service workers ‚Äì a girl sitting next to the door was wearing the jacket with the logo of a popular supermarket chain, for example. The man took a seat on the upper floor and looked out of the big window that wrapped around the front of the bus. As the journey progressed, more and more places began to open up along the road and the pavements filled with life. Mostly it was stony-faced people barrelling along on their way to work, but there were a few more relaxed types, chatting with friends or heading into one of the many slightly-subpar-looking coffee shops and cafes (the type that dot the outskirts of any city).

Eventually, the bus was drawn into the city centre. Men in gilets carrying flat whites hurried along beside it, carefully displaying the subtle symbols of their status ‚Äì every item they wore came from brands both recognisable and (supposedly) artisanal. As the bus approached a square, the man saw the homeless being hurried out of tents by police, eager to avoid any blemish on the exterior of this citadel to the virtues of capitalist development.

A short while later he got off the bus and made the short walk to central station. There, he bought a ticket and promptly boarded a train.

The next stage of the journey was boring and without note. The man stared out the window at the green embankment either side of the tracks, which was littered with random pieces of plastic and old cloth. At one point, he saw a shoe.

The train arrived at a small town, and the man got off. He had to squint as he stepped out onto the platform as the sun now shone brightly. It had turned into a really beautiful day. There was scarcely a cloud in the sky, which was a gentle shade of blue. The town itself, however, was less interesting. Though beautifully surrounded by coniferous forests and steep hillsides, it felt shockingly similar to the road the bus had travelled down earlier. There was a chain supermarket, a coffee shop and a take-away, none of which would have seemed out of place in the suburb the man called home.

Luckily, he did not have to dwell on the vacuousness of his surroundings for long. A bus pulled into the stop on the high street and he boarded.

It took him out of the town and into the thick forests of the countryside occasionally pulling into villages or gas stations as it made its progress to the next notable town over. The man, however, did not get the far. He alighted at a trailhead in a particularly lovely section of forest, filled with bluebells and soundtracked by the low hum of birdsong and crickets.

It was only a short walk to his destination. The man travelled through the forest and along the course of a small stream until it led him to the shores of a lake. By now, the sun was beginning to set. He sat down on the pebbly beach and took it in. Nature‚Äôs beauty overwhelmed him. A red glow emerged from the thick woodland hillsides that hid this spot from the world. The lake itself was deep blue in colour, and completely still. The last of the sunlight refracted off it perfectly.

Eventually, the man got up and walked into the lake. The water was punishingly cold, but it seemed not to affect him. It rose higher up his legs, then onto his torso. He started to swim, head held just above the water. Slowly, he got more and more tired, which combined with the chill of the water to begin to numb him. Yet he felt calm. A smile flicked across his face as his head sunk below the surface.

Some time later, someone on a hike found a skull on the shore.

**I cheated on my girlfriend. It‚Äôs been 2 years since she left me, and I punish myself by staying with my AP. I hate my AP. Part E**

I (Leland 29M) have been in a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù with Madison (28F) for almost 2 years. I don‚Äôt expect to get any sympathy here. I did this to myself. I used to blame everyone else for my problems. I used to be controlling. I used to be a sleazeball.¬†

Some people may think I still am these things but I really try not to be anymore. It took me a really long time to realize I was my problem.

To give some background, I used to do some pretty shady shit. Doing this is how I met Kara (23F now, 18F when we met). I was 24 years old and two years out of college. I had done good with the girls in college and racked up a solid body count. However, when I got out of college I wasn‚Äôt really ready for anything serious, and found the dating scene tougher. I had a good job, and I know I‚Äôm a good looking guy. It wasn‚Äôt that it was hard to get dates. I just ended up getting dumped or blown off more often. I was immature. I realize that now. The women in my age range that I was trying to date were looking for more. I don‚Äôt mean they all just wanted to settle down and get married, plenty of them that I talked to said they were fine with casual dating. By more, I mean they were looking for someone who didn‚Äôt get shit drunk whenever possible, play video games like it was their job, or ignore them until he wanted sex.¬†

Since this wasn‚Äôt working for me I decided to go younger. I‚Äôm not proud of it but I used to occasionally go to parties with my little brother. He was a college Freshman, so I would usually just go to his parties, but one night he was going to this party in another town, that was actually a high school party. I tagged along, and that is where I met Kara. This was in May so she was like 2 weeks from her graduation, not that that makes it any better.

She was absolutely stunning, still is.¬† We hit it off and I got her snap that night. She was going to the local university in the Fall, and I lived close enough to campus. We spent most of the summer together. I realized I was falling in love with her, and showed that by becoming more jealous and controlling. It was all underhanded. Early on when she wanted to go to a party or club with friends, and I knew there would be a lot of guys there, I‚Äôd do something over the top like get concert tickets or plan a weekend vacation so she wouldn‚Äôt go. Over time I began playing the victim, or accusing her of things when she had plans. I wanted to ruin her mood. I would impose myself in the things I couldn‚Äôt get her to opt out of. It was all jealousy and insecurity.

When her Junior year started, I talked her into moving in with me. This was for me, even though I presented it as being best for her (financially it was, and I focused on that).¬† I had her in a tough spot. She was basically acting as my housekeeper, and I held her financial independence over her head. My only attempt at balancing that out was that I did spoil her in terms of gifts and luxuries. The thing was, while she was always very appreciative, she really wasn‚Äôt the kind of girl who needed all that.¬†

When I had started working at my current job there was a woman there in an open relationship named Abigail. She was older. I liked to overhear her conversations with some of my other coworkers. Abigail was very open about her lifestyle and not ashamed of it one bit. I would often tell Kara about what I overheard, because it was just so crazy. I would have never gone into something like that, the idea of sharing my girl with someone else was ridiculous. That was until I met Madison. We were flirty from her first day and that only increased from there. After a week she asked her husband for an open relationship. We wanted to fuck around, and we didn‚Äôt want to lose our significant others. It took me a lot longer to finally approach Kara and by that time Madison had made the situation with her husband worse, they were no longer doing an open relationship and were going to try swinging.¬†

Of course I lied to Kara about this and told her that Madison‚Äôs open had been wonderful and we should try something like that. The dumbest part of it all is I wasn‚Äôt really willing to share Kara. The idea of her with another man made me furious, which makes the swinging I asked her to go along with all the dumber. I wanted to have sex with Madison, and was willing to play the dumbest game ever to make it happen. Madison was too though, she didn‚Äôt have a lot of respect for her husband Seth. She thought he was a push over, and when he was going to walk out on their marriage because of the open relationship she forced on him, she had to backtrack and find a way to get what she wanted. That was swinging. She also thought this could bring him back under her thumb. I know this because she has told me so. She was so upset that he was going to leave her, that she was determined to ‚Äúbreak him.‚Äù¬†

As we went about making this happen. We totally ignored all their pleas, all their requests for time, space, communication, clarity. We gaslit them, pushed them, falsely reassured them. I feel like such an asshole for putting Kara through that, and Seth too, he didn‚Äôt deserve it either. In the end Madison and I got our wish, we got permission to fuck, and we got the consequences that came with it.¬†

We were so delusional. We both really thought we could have our good time, and they wouldn‚Äôt do anything about it. Neither of us wanted them to fuck anyone else. We were ‚Äúmaking rules for thee not for me.‚Äù Our goal was actually to have each other, and them to also pay attention to us. I remember us discussing how we didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd actually do anything with each other. Even if they did, we planned on asking them to focus on us, like they were going to be okay being our ‚Äúfluffers‚Äù or something.¬†

Then we made the plan. Abigail had mentioned to Madison that she was having a house party in 2 weeks. Madison had been confiding in her, and getting advice from her about open relationships, and then on swinging. Madison told me that could be our chance. She told Abigail about mine and Kara‚Äôs desire for swinging, a half truth. Abigail had already invited Madison at this point, to ‚Äúget Her and Seth‚Äôs feet wet.‚Äù Abigail then agreed to let us come as well.

Madison and I were so excited to make this happen at that point. We had the ‚Äúvibe check.‚Äù Which turned out to be a big part of our undoing, as unbeknownst to us, Seth and Kara began talking. Comparing notes would be a better term, they were very much onto us.

The day of the party was total tunnel vision for me, I could see the goal, and I was going doing everything I could to get there. At the same time I was such a dick, I totally ignored everything Kara was saying. We got there, we got a tour, and then I immediately looked to take Madison upstairs to the private rooms. She was more than willing to go. We were totally ignoring our partners. They just stood there and watched us walk off. I, in a complete afterthought moment, told Kara to ‚Äúcome on.‚Äù But I really didn‚Äôt care. As we hit the room, we both talked about how they didn‚Äôt follow us. We were excited about that, we could do this, and they wouldn‚Äôt do anything. That‚Äôs what we thought. We had sex for 20-25 minutes, then lingered a bit, talking and laughing, got dressed. I fully expected to find Kara and Seth sitting in the living room sulking. We had talked a bit about damage control with them. They were not there. Our first thought was they took a car and left. Seth did have the keys to his. We went outside only to see both vehicles still there. Then we headed to where the food was, also not there. We heard some fairly large commotion from one of the rooms.¬†

Imagine my shock as I walked in to see Kara, completely naked, ass in the air, paired up with some other woman giving a guy I‚Äôve never seen in my life a BJ sandwich. Madison was just as mind blown watching an older woman with jumbo tits riding Seth like she was trying to win the PBR national championships. I was frozen. I didn‚Äôt know what to do or how to respond. Then suddenly Kara and Seth just stopped with the others and started fucking each other. He was on top of her just going to town, when suddenly she grabs him tight and pulls him as close as possible. I knew he was cumming in her right there, bareback (I thought I was going to pass out when she pulled his condom off right before pulling him on top of her).

The fallout was massive and immediate. We screamed and yelled at each other the whole way home and through the night. She was calling me out on everything I had pulled over the course of our entire relationship.¬† Seth and Madison were apparently doing the exact same thing. Kara left me the next morning.¬†

I was devastated by that. I feel like I became the poster child for ‚Äúfuck around and find out.‚Äù Madison called me a week after all this went down, it was also the day after Seth served her with divorce papers. We just had a brief conversation as I was still trying to process losing Kara. Madison was cold, it was kind of weird. She didn‚Äôt sound mad, or sad, just neutral. Like we were talking about the electric bill being due soon. I should have taken that as my first red flag.¬†

I tried just moving on. I remember telling myself, ‚Äúher loss.‚Äù What a joke, Kara definitely wasn‚Äôt losing anything, she could do so much better than me. It was about a month later, I had made a fake account and was social media stalking Kara to see what she was doing. I realized her and Seth had become a couple. She photo dumped a month's worth of outings and dates they had been on. The next week at work Madison, who had largely ignored me that month, was back being flirty and friendly. I kind of called her out on it. She asked if I had seen that Seth and Kara were together. She said she wanted to meet after work that night, and invited me over for dinner. I agreed because I figured why the hell not, might even get laid again.¬†

She texted me shortly before I had gotten to her apartment to just let myself in as she was getting ready. When I walked in she told me to relax for a moment, she would only be another minute. After about 10 I got a text from her asking me to come into her bedroom. As I walked in there she was at the foot of her bed, completely naked on her knees telling me to come here. Obviously you can figure out what happened from there. She was largely insatiable that entire night and insisted on me staying over, where she kept up this sex crazed act for most of the next day.¬†

It was when I started to get ready to head home the next afternoon that she told me she wanted us to give this a real shot. She said our SO‚Äôs have moved on with each other, we should do the same. We get along, have fun, sex is awesome, why not? Considering the time she had just shown me I was all in for this.¬†

Things were good at first however, I could tell there was something off. She wanted to document and post on socials EVERYTHING we did together. I don‚Äôt just mean trips or dinner dates to nice restaurants. I mean everything. If I got us Taco Bell after a long day, she made it into this sappy romantic post about how ‚Äúwe just get each other‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a mind reader.‚Äù¬† She always made it sound like we were just the happiest couple ever. Which really wasn‚Äôt true. Yes she was sleeping with me a lot, and always planning these outings. But the conversations were bland, and emotional support was not there. When my childhood cat (the cat still lived with my parents) died at 19, I was understandably sad. I was having a moment at work that day about it, I may have even had a tear or two in my eyes. She was noticeably uncomfortable. When I came over that night she wanted to get take out, and make a post about it. I was sad, and having a hard time smiling. She got annoyed, told me it was just a cat. I said I loved that cat. She rolled her eyes and said, ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôll give you a blowjob if you‚Äôll just smile for the fucking photo and stop talking about the cat. Do that, I'll top you off, and you can go be sad the rest of the night, deal?‚Äù Of course I accepted, but looking back now I realize I should have walked out and never looked back.¬†

Things only got weirder from there. We had been together about 6 months at the time. I knew she constantly checked to see what Seth was doing. One day, she told me she had gotten a new phone. She read somewhere that everyone should have 2 phones, one for business and one for personal use. I could understand that if you were a public figure but we weren‚Äôt. We were just office drones. I just accepted this as it wasn‚Äôt worth debating. That night we had sex with all of the lights on. Leaving the table side lamp on wasn‚Äôt unusual, but she had the overhead light on, the light in the bathroom on, the other lamp on. She insisted that I finish on her chest, just kept dirty talking me about it. After I did, she grabbed her new phone and told me to take a picture, and she would send it to me. Then she said, ‚Äúoops‚Äù. I felt this wave of concern come over me. She told me she ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù sent the pic to Seth. I got pissed off because how do you accidentally send it, and also, why would you even need his number in your new phone?¬†

Even without the resulting blow up from her the next day, I knew she sent that photo as some sort of half baked idea to make him jealous. To his credit, he didn‚Äôt take the bait at all. Instead he sent back a video that set her off like no other. It starts as just a selfie shot of him, and he goes, ‚ÄúGot your pic, glad to see you're having fun, anyway Kara says Hi (At this point it pans over, and there‚Äôs Kara in sports wear looking amazing, and she goes, ‚ÄúHi Maddie!‚ÄùI should mention Madison hates being called Maddie, then he pans back) we‚Äôre having fun too (Video pans up to the King‚Äôs Island entrance sign) I'm going to go ahead and¬† block this number now, and if you send another picture like this to me I will go to the authorities. Byeeeee‚Äù

After this, she became increasingly insistent on us moving in together. I didn‚Äôt want to but I was also in a deep depression that I was unaware of at the time. I was in a real doom spiral of self hate. I agreed and I ended up moving in with Madison. She was still trying to present a ‚ÄúWe are the perfect couple‚Äù vibe to the world. It was bullshit, I just didn‚Äôt want to be alone, as much as I was unhappy with everything, sitting at my apartment alone was worse. Which is how I ended up where I am today.¬†

It was about 2 months after we moved in together I saw on Kara‚Äôs socials that her and Seth had broken up. Looks like it was mutual and amicable, no real detail. That was over a year ago, and they appear to still be friends. They still interact with each other on socials, commenting on each other‚Äôs posts, wishing happy birthdays, Seth was even at Kara‚Äôs graduation celebration with her friends and family. When I told Madison about this, she completely changed.

She already wasn‚Äôt the most loving partner in the world, but she got colder. It was about 2 weeks later she came to me one night and said, ‚ÄúI want to be in an open relationship again, this isn‚Äôt really negotiable, I also don‚Äôt want a bunch of stupid rules. What the fuck is the point if there‚Äôs going to be a 100 limitations. You can either be cool with this, make peace with this, or move on.‚Äù I was so delusional at the time, I actually thought this would be a good thing for me.

The thing was I had kind of let myself go. I wasn‚Äôt working out very much, I was drinking a lot. We ate out way too much. Mentally and Emotionally I was putting on a tough stoic front but on the inside I was dying. I had blown it with Kara and now was replacing that with self-destruction. I agreed to Madison‚Äôs terms and told her I wanted 2 rules: Use protection every time, and no details unless the other person asks for them. She was fine with that. The next day was Friday, she went out after work, and didn‚Äôt come home until Saturday morning. I asked her where she was and she said, ‚ÄúWith a guy.‚Äù It kind of shocked me, I don‚Äôt know why, it shouldn‚Äôt have. I‚Äôm sure she had him lined up before she ever asked. I just thought, ‚ÄúOkay, two can play this game.‚Äù¬†

I was wrong, this was a very one sided game. Over the next 3 months our relationship went to shit. She only wanted to have sex with me, right after she got back from doing it with someone else. Which embarrassingly to admit I was taking her up on because otherwise I wasn‚Äôt getting anything. I have no idea if she was seeing multiple people (this is what I assumed) or just the same 1 or 2. I occasionally would ask where she was going or where she was, and she always replied, ‚ÄúWith a guy.‚Äù

Meanwhile, I was having no luck on the open market. I was struggling at work, I was still drinking, my confidence was shit because I couldn‚Äôt get a match to save my life. I went back to doing shady shit at this point. I switched my profile to a much younger, fitter picture from a few years earlier. When I got a match with this woman named Evelyn, I was ecstatic. She was poly-ish, and I thought maybe this would be a chance to just have something else for myself.¬† We messaged for about 2 weeks, she was aware of Madison and she told me a little about her long term partner Anthony, I wasn‚Äôt honest here either as I made it seem like Madison and I had this amazing connection. We met for dinner one night, I could tell she was a little skeptical because I didn‚Äôt quite match my photo. I did my best to cover up the weight difference with the right clothes, but you could still tell some. We were actually having a pretty nice conversation, when she asked what got me into opens.¬† I deflected with a chuckle and said, ‚ÄúMadison‚Äù but I said it weakly, and she picked up on it. Then I just kind of word vomited about how it started, and about Kara. I wasn‚Äôt overly forward but I said enough to kill the vibe. She said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt really want to be doing this do you.‚Äù I just shook my head. We talked a little bit more where she told me I didn‚Äôt have to be what I didn‚Äôt want to be. I said, ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù Then she stared at me for a moment, ‚ÄúYou also can be what you actually want to be.‚Äù That hit me like a ton of bricks. I asked if she wanted to go and I‚Äôd take her back home. She said I didn‚Äôt need to, she had messaged Anthony to pick her up and he was probably outside already. I paid the check and thanked her for the night, then headed out ahead of her.¬†

I got home and was thinking about what she said. It was true that I didn‚Äôt like myself. I checked Kara‚Äôs socials, only to discover at that moment she was in a new relationship. I felt all those same familiar feelings of loss, jealousy, self-pity. I went to bed but couldn‚Äôt sleep. Madison came rolling in at 2am. Trying to fuck me, which was a clear indicator of what she had done that night. I wasn‚Äôt interested and rejected her. She got a little pissy but not much. She said, ‚ÄúWait you had a date tonight, how did it go, did it go good, must have if you don‚Äôt want any.‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúIt went fine.‚Äù She in a condescending way said, ‚ÄúFine? Like you got your dick wet fine, or you got a second date fine?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about it.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúOh no, you had two rules, one of them is no details unless asked, and I‚Äôm asking.‚Äù I begrudgingly replied, ‚ÄúNeither then, we won‚Äôt be going out again, but it went fine.‚Äù She laughed, and made an L shape with her hand, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kidding, I had about the opposite night, so we even out.‚Äù

For the first time I pressed for more details, ‚ÄúYeah, what did you do then.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúI ended up meeting up with this couple I‚Äôve been talking to, I hadn‚Äôt ever had a threesome but that changed tonight.‚Äù I actually couldn‚Äôt believe that, I had asked her about doing something like that repeatedly since we opened. She always told me that she wasn‚Äôt interested. I decided to call her out on that. She replied, ‚ÄúWhen I said I wasn‚Äôt interested, it meant I wasn‚Äôt interested in doing that with you.‚Äù

I just walked away from her at that point and headed for the kitchen. She didn‚Äôt follow and when I heard the shower turn on I went to lay on the couch. The next day she got up and went out to coffee with a couple of friends. I remember staring in the mirror for what must have been 15 minutes. I was thinking about what Evelyn said, thinking about how quickly Kara moved on from me, thinking about how awful it has been with Madison. I hated who I was looking at in the mirror.¬†

I made the decision to take Evelyn‚Äôs words seriously, I COULD be the person I WANTED to be. That was maybe just a little over a year ago now. I am still living with Madison. I am cordial and polite to her, she is not that way to me. I refuse to sleep with her which has led her to go out more often, and I‚Äôm pretty sure she has at least 2 full-time FWBs. I have been sober for a year now, and have been hitting the gym frequently. I might even say I‚Äôm in better shape than I was before. I put myself into work and have been getting noticed. I like taking on a little more than I have to, and focusing on some of the tougher assignments. My ultimate goal is to one day be a VP. I have been attending bi-weekly therapy appointments this whole time. I really had to face a lot of my own behaviors and shame. It‚Äôs been a long road of self-discovery. I think it will be very beneficial when I hit the dating scene again. I haven‚Äôt even tried for a relationship during this time.¬†

I‚Äôm finally ready to move forward with my life. I haven‚Äôt told Madison any of this. I don‚Äôt feel I owe her anything. She is a cold and bitter woman who uses people. That might be the toughest part, she expects me to basically serve her, which I have done for a long time just to keep the peace. I am done. I have lined up a new apartment for myself, and will be moving out this week. I‚Äôm just going to pack up and leave. I‚Äôll leave a note behind. I have managed to find a new job as well. A competitor was looking to fill a director position. I didn‚Äôt land that position, but they also needed an assistant director, and I was offered that position. Either was a pay increase so I accepted the assistant spot. I also am looking at this as a chance to grow, I don‚Äôt want to go into it with any bitterness towards whoever got the director spot. Even though they will be my direct boss I‚Äôm working with on a daily basis. I‚Äôm going to do whatever I can to be of value.¬†

Anyway, this is long enough already. I can‚Äôt wait to start this new chapter and am finally happy with the person I see in the mirror. Wish me luck.

**I was recently hired to a new position. As it turns out I am now the direct boss to my ex-wife‚Äôs affair partner. Part F**¬†¬†¬†¬†

I (Seth 30M) started a new job about 6 months ago. I switched companies to become this new one‚Äôs director of projects. Huge pay increase for me. At the time they actually needed both a director and an assistant director.¬† I¬† was really excited about the position.¬†

On the first day, I met early with the VP. I, along with the assistant director, were going to be introduced to our team today. I had arrived first and was chatting with the VP when the AD arrived. Much to my surprise it was Leland (30M), the guy my ex-wife cheated with. He looked more shocked than I did I‚Äôm sure. Kind of funny now thinking back to how big his eyes got when he saw me. The VP was noticeably confused, but we played it off. The rest of the day went on as normal, tense, but normal.¬†

At the end of the day Leland approached me wanting to talk. I told him sternly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you to say anything, I don‚Äôt want to hear from you on anything other than work. I don‚Äôt know how you managed to get this position, but you better do your job and do it well, because I will be making sure everything is perfect.‚Äù I then turned and walked away. He stopped me and said, ‚ÄúI am qualified for this position. I know you think I‚Äôm just a piece of shit. And I was. I‚Äôm sorry for all that, but I‚Äôll show¬† you, I‚Äôm worthy of this chance.‚Äù I began walking away, and he yelled one more thing, ‚Äú‚ÄòAlso, I left Madison.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt believe him one bit, why would I, this guy wrecked my marriage. Well, in the 6 months we have been working together, he has actually been really valuable. He knows his stuff and he always comes through before deadline. I only talk with him about work, and kind of give the cold shoulder to anything else. He is friendly but professional and respectful with me and the other staff members. He has not once since that first day brought up Kara or Madison.¬†

Anyway I‚Äôm starting to feel bad. I do talk more personally with the other staff. Simple stuff like asking how their weekend was or how the kids are doing. I don‚Äôt ask him about anything other than work. Some of the staff will go out on Fridays and I started to notice that he was never invited. I decided to ask the young, no filter intern why and he told me, ‚ÄúFirst off, everyone loves you, especially compared to the last guy. Alina, picked up on you not liking him, got to be a reason for that, so we all keep our distance.‚Äù Well fuck, he‚Äôs getting exiled because of me, which really isn‚Äôt fair. Our past aside he is really valuable to the team, and hasn‚Äôt done anything to warrant exclusion from the others.¬†

So I started being more personable with him over the past few months. Asking how he‚Äôs doing, how the weekend was. We started talking sports, which led to talking other stuff. We have a lot in common actually. I still don‚Äôt like him very much because of our history but sometimes I feel like Ricky Bobby in that movie after Cal moves into his house like, ‚ÄúWhy am I still talking to you.‚Äù Anyway that gave everyone the okay to be friendlier with him and I heard him get invited to a poker night the other day, so i guess mission accomplished.¬†

That brings us to now. I have to evaluate the employees in my department. Within that I can also recommend for termination, renewal, or transfer to another department. There is another assistant director spot within the company that is open, and with my recommendation I‚Äôm sure the transfer would get accepted. He would make the same, it's a straight parallel move. He has been a great asset to the team, I‚Äôm just not sure about continuing this long term.

Edit: Okay everyone I got it, you read back through my previous stuff and want an update on what happened with Kara. We were good, the relationship was fun and exciting. However, when we got to around the 7 month mark we both started to change. I began to become more insecure about her. I have no doubt this stems from the trauma I suffered in my marriage. It was a ME problem. I was a little suffocating, and I had a lot of anxiety when she was on her phone or going out without me. This led to me being a bit passive aggressive. I owned it then and we talked about it a lot.¬†

At the same time she was nearing her graduation and getting her BSN. She was only 21 when we got together and had been mostly in long term relationships. She had just gotten out of a very controlling one with Leland when we started together. After that relationship she often told me she felt way more confident about herself. I could tell she was changing into a much stronger and more independent person. A person who wanted to go and discover herself to the fullest extent.

I sought out therapy as I had never processed my failed marriage. She sought out independence. Ultimately we made a decision together to end things. It was very amicable. We remain friends. I was invited to her family graduation party and had a nice time, and while slightly awkward the weirdness was minimal. We still talk some through social media but each have our own lives going. Sorry not much to the story. I think if it were a few years from now and we were meeting it may have led to more, but for where we both were in life it was just a matter of ‚Äúright person, wrong time.‚Äù Maybe someday we will reconnect, you never know, though I‚Äôm not holding my breath as I have seen that she has been seeing someone else.¬†

**My ex-husband and my last serious boyfriend, both ghosted me. Now I‚Äôm looking to move up the career ladder and they are preventing me from doing so. Part G**

I (Madison 29F) have a serious problem. I currently work for a fairly large company. However, the company is going through a bit of a downturn, and some layoffs are expected. I may be one of these. In an effort to get ahead of the game I have begun applying for positions with some of the other large companies here in the greater Cleveland area. While I have interviews scheduled with 2 employers, these are parallel moves to what I am currently doing. There is a 3rd place I have applied that has an assistant director of marketing position open. This would be a promotion, and I am qualified for it. I have not received a call back for an interview yet, and I believe there may be a sinister reason behind that.¬†

My ex-husband (Seth 30M) and my ex-boyfriend (Leland 30M) both work there. They also appear to work together on the same team, which is surprising as they both hated each other at one point in time. Each of these men blame me for the failure of our relationship. Which is very far from the truth.¬†

My ex-husband Seth and I were together for 4 years. Things were great for most of that time. We had clear roles within our relationship and they seemed to work for us. We both worked, and he handled a lot of the domestic tasks while I made sure things were organized, planned, and accounted for. Our problems began when we decided to open our relationship. At first we believed it would bring us closer together by improving our communication and intimacy. I had a coworker who was in one and she was very open with how much it improved her relationship. Seth and I talked at great lengths about it, came up with very specific boundaries, and agreed to give it a shot. I made us dating profiles and from there we were off. I was the first one to get a date. I went on that date and got home just a little later than I expected. This made Seth freak out and threaten me with divorce. I was taken aback because we had agreed to try this, we talked through a lot of stuff ahead of time, and he still had a very aggressive reaction. I told him we could stop and go at a much slower pace. After more discussion we decided to try swinging, as we felt that would be easier for Seth.¬†

At the same time I had a coworker named Leland (my later live-in boyfriend). He had a girlfriend named Kara. They were into swinging also. We all made plans together to ‚Äúswap‚Äù at a mutual friends Lifestyle party. Everything was good, it seemed we had all vibed together and were on the same page. At the party, Leland and I wanted to try swapping with our significant others. We asked them to join us in a private room so we could test how far we wanted this to go. As Leland and I made our way to some private rooms, we realized that Seth and Kara hadn‚Äôt followed us despite us directly asking them to, and this being the plan the whole time. Leland and I decided to try and find them. When we did we were shocked to see they had joined a full blown orgy. Each of them having sex with multiple people in the room. We stood and watched hoping to get their attention. They were so wrapped up in their carnal exploits they never even noticed us. The worst part was watching my Husband break our number one rule and not use protection with Kara. He even finished inside of her.¬†

After we left the party, I tried to tell Seth how he made me feel. I was hurt that he didn‚Äôt use protection, and I was hurt that he abandoned the plan of swapping. This made him angry and he left our apartment for a hotel room. I found out later that he invited Kara there and the two of them spent several days together. He would serve me with divorce papers later that week and block me on everything. I never got to see him 1 on 1 again.¬†¬†

Having both lost the loves of our lives, Leland and I sought each other for comfort. This blossomed into a loving relationship and we eventually moved in together. Over time we decided to try opening the relationship. Just as before we discussed rules and boundaries thoroughly. I began to date some, yet Leland only made minimal effort. I considered backing off but found he was only interested in sleeping with me on days I was returning from being with another man. In order to make him happy I began going out more often. I thought everything was going well, until one day I came home from an overnight trip with friends to find all of his things gone. He had moved, and quit the job at our mutual place of employment. He just disappeared from my life.

Now I am trying to find employment at the very place they both work, and it is the only place I have applied that hasn‚Äôt requested an interview. I am having a hard time believing that, given my skills and experience, this employer would not at very least give me an interview unless someone was purposely trying to black ball me.

Given the way they both simply ghosted me after years together. I am not completely surprised by this, but I had hoped enough time had passed that they would get over whatever imagined slights they believe I have committed against them. I am considering taking action against them in whatever form that may require. Hopefully, it will not come to that, and they will simply see the error of their ways and endorse my hiring.

**My ex-girlfriend wants my help getting back at her ex-husband. It will be financially beneficial for me to help her, but I‚Äôm torn. Part H**

I (Leland 30M) was recently contacted by my ex-girlfriend, Madison (29F). Madison was once married to my boss Seth (30M). She is upset because her employer is downsizing. She has had success in finding similar jobs to the one she currently has, however, the company Seth and I work for had an opening that would be a promotion for her. She believed that Seth and I were black balling her from getting the position. In reality we didn‚Äôt even know she had applied as neither of us is in HR, and she isn‚Äôt applying for a spot in our department.¬†¬†

It comes as no surprise that she would create this ‚ÄúOut to get me‚Äù narrative. She was the most delusional and controlling woman I have ever met. I consider our entire relationship to be my penance for how terrible of a person I was at the time.

Anyway, now that the position has been filled. Madison wants revenge and another shot at an assistant director position. Her plan is convoluted, and borderline insane.¬†

Our department does have an opening, but it‚Äôs an entry level spot. Madison‚Äôs plan involves her applying for that position. Seth would be part of this, and would be notified of the application because he is the director. Most likely he will nix that application immediately. Madison is then going to create false text records using old messages between her and Seth. When she inevitably doesn‚Äôt get that position she is going to go to HR with this, claiming Seth was harassing and targeting her. She wants me to back her up, claiming I saw an altercation between them. She wants me to also lie and claim that Seth often talks of ‚Äúgetting back at‚Äù his ex-wife. The reality is he never mentions her, and shivers whenever her name is said. One of the guys once mentioned seeing ‚Äúthis really old movie, Billy Madison,‚Äù and Seth jumped like someone just lunged at him from the shadows.

Now Madison is selling this pretty hard to me. She keeps saying that if Seth gets terminated or transferred then I‚Äôll be the new director. Thing is, that is probably true. I have done really well there and I want that job. She thinks if I got the director spot I could then hire her as the AD. I would never fucking do that.¬†

Seth and I have actually worked really well together. Even showing glimpses of being friendly of late. I have done all this work to be the person I want to be, yet I keep thinking it may be worth taking this chance and getting the promotion earlier. My ultimate goal is to be a VP. I should do the right thing, but I‚Äôm not going to lie, it is tempting.

Update: Hey everybody, it all went down this past Thursday. Madison was correct. When her application came in and Seth got notified he immediately nixed it. Madison got the usual, thanks for applying but we‚Äôre not going further email. She promptly came in the next day and walked straight to the HR department. I didn‚Äôt know she had done this until I got summoned to HR. I walked in and they wanted me to substantiate some claims that were being made.

A few hours after this, I got a text from Seth. He sounded upset and shaken. He wanted to get some answers and told me he knew if Madison was involved then I probably was as well. I told him I‚Äôd tell him in person. When I arrived at the bar he handed me a fresh beer and said, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù I cut him off, ‚ÄúIt was the right thing to do, but if I‚Äôm being honest, I did it just as much for me as anyone else. I needed to exorcize that demon just as much as you did.‚Äù¬† We had a beer and I told him all about how she had approached me and was planning on getting back at him. How she said I‚Äôd be the next director and then she could come in as AD. Like I would ever trust that succubus to be around me again. What I did was print out all of our exchanges where she was planning this. I also vouched for Seth‚Äôs character stating he would never do something like this. The evidence spoke for itself, and from what I understand Madison has now black balled herself from every position within the company, probably at every branch and every affiliate. What can I say, it sucks to suck.

Seth had been brought to HR at the end of the day and made aware of the situation, which is why he was upset when he called me. We drank our one beer and had a few laughs. He thanked me again and left. I decided to stay and have one more. When I got back home I made it an early night. I went to bed thinking, ‚ÄúI really like the new me.‚Äù

1kzy8kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/terf_trans_fight/comments/1kzy8kj/we_have_an_ally_problem/,We Have An Ally Problem,"I've discussed this so many times, and I think if this sub is going to be repurposed, and this is a great time for a topic that is very dear to my heart:

# We have an ally problem

When I transitioned there were fewer than 10,000 post-operative transsexuals of both sexes in the US. As of just a few years ago, a former activist found data which showed that there were fewer than 50,000 fully transitioned - legal name and gender marker - transsexuals in the US.

The first figure came from calculations involving major SRS surgeons in the US and Canada and the percentage of patients leaving the US, or coming to the US, to have SRS. Included in that were the number of surgeries which were either revisions (re-doing a procedure) or ""upgrades"" (doing a second or third produced on a person who'd already had an SRS-related procedure).

If you look at surveys, all of which are done by ""allies"", because ""enemies"" use those surveys as well, there are supposedly about 3 million ""trans people"" in the US. That's really simple math, and it comes out to about a 100x difference.

I've mentioned that we need a 95 to 99 percent reduction in ""transitions"", the bulk of that is in that 100x difference. It's not the 50,000 fully transitioned, including legal paperwork changed, people pushing the narrative that the other 2,950,000 ""trans people"" are valid. You can go to subs like r/Transmedical and you'll find no support for the belief everything is valid, and you can go to places like r/MtF and r/ftm, and there's no support for ""the only valid trans people are the ones who fully transition and try to fully assimilate"".

What it means is the 2,950,000 people aren't supported by the 50,000 people, they are primarily supported by the 75,000,000 or so people who voted for Kamala Harris. That's about a 1000x difference.

I was a member of a large LGBT group with somewhere around 5,000 members in it. I was the only post-SRS fully transitioned person in that group. There were 1 or 2, depending on when I'm talking about, not-yet-fully-transitioned trans people in that group. My positions were in the minority. There's a repeat of that 1000x difference.

What I would ask anyone - *Terves* or *Trainees* \- who is trying to solve these problems to do is ask if the people pushing whatever contentious issue is being discussed, are the problematic people fully transitioned trans people, or are they something else. And if they are ""something else"", or are they cisgender allies.

When I was in middle and high school - ages 12 to 17, because I'm a high school dropout - I didn't need ""pronouns"". What I needed was protection from bullying. I didn't need my ""gender identity affirmed"". I think having my ""gender identity affirmed"" in school would have ratcheted up the abuse to the point I'd probably have left high school at 16. I had a drinking problem at 16 (I had a drinking problem at 15 as well) and I doubt I'd have made it to college.

I did not need to run track, or play baseball or soccer, against girls. I didn't need ""pronouns"". I didn't need to have long hair or wear dresses. I needed protection from bullying, and given my particular circumstances, I needed all the advancements in medical science over the last 50 years.

Our ""allies"" are the ones pushing ""pronouns"" and social transition at 12, and ""expressing our true selves"".

The 50,000 of us, in the US, who are working jobs and mowing our lawns are hugely outnumbered and *Bad Terves* act like we're the ones pushing what is being done by the rest of the 2,950,000 or 75,000,000 people.

I just finished my first cup of coffee. I've taken my daily hormones and vitamins and mineral supplements. I'm sitting in my kitchen in just my undies, and I'm going to go into the laundry room and start a load of whites, then knits, and try to wrap up leftover job work from this week. I got my tax refund 3 weeks ago, I paid some property taxes recently, I'm clearing weeds out of my garden beds. I'm not off doing weird things that *Bad Terves* should find offensive, and I'm not doing things that *Bad Trainees* think I need to be doing for them. Once the laundry is started, I need to clean out and change a bunch of cat litter. When the sun has been out long enough to dry out my yard, I'll go mow my yard. I won't be screaming ""It's MA'AM!"" at the people in the garden shop I'm going to visit.

That is the life of the 50,000 of us who are suffering the consequences of anywhere from 3-75,000,000 people saying we need to be different.

All I have to say is f\*ck our f\*cking allies who've f\*cked up my life with their stupid f\*cking sh\*t.",3,1748701285.0,terf_trans_fight,2,1.0,False

1kzy79l,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1kzy79l/is_the_kurdene_wireless_earbuds_bluetooth/,Is the kurdene Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth Headphones Worth It? A Bad Reviewers Analysis,"Looking for¬†[wireless earbuds under 10](https://amzn.to/4jrJmoM)¬†dollars that actually sound decent, or are you about to waste another tenner on tinny drivers and spotty Bluetooth? When I saw the¬†[kurdene earbuds review](https://amzn.to/4jrJmoM)¬†requests roll in, I raised an eyebrow‚Äîcheap wireless gear rarely survives more than a week in my ears. After testing these¬†**budget true wireless earbuds**¬†through calls, podcasts, and gym playlists, here‚Äôs my brutally honest take on whether they‚Äôre a hidden gem or a dumpster dive.

Why I picked the kurdene earbuds: the promise of sub-$10 price tag, hype around ‚Äú10-hour battery life,‚Äù and the lure of true wireless convenience. My typical use case: treadmill runs, hands-free calls during grocery trips, and background tunes while I work from my caf√© corner.

# Controls & UI

These earbuds employ a single-button interface on each bud‚Äîpress once for play/pause, twice for next track, and long-press for voice assistant. Sounds simple, but in practice the buttons are mushy and poorly positioned. I spent more time wrestling with the controls than enjoying my music. The¬†**cheap wireless earbuds review**¬†experience suffers when you can‚Äôt reliably skip songs or answer calls without fishing around for the right bud.

There‚Äôs no companion app, so there‚Äôs zero customization. If you expect EQ presets or volume sync, move along‚Äîthis is bare-bones Bluetooth operation that feels stuck in 2010.

# Specifications & Connectivity

On paper, you get Bluetooth 5.0, claimed 33-ft range, and 8 hours per charge with the charging case offering ‚Äú50 more hours.‚Äù In reality, connectivity drops at \~20 feet and only through a single drywall partition. Audio sync in videos lagged noticeably, and phone calls often cut in and out. The¬†**low-cost wireless headphones**¬†tag here means you‚Äôll trade stable connection for the sub-$10 price.

The charging case is micro-USB, not USB-C, and the flimsy lid barely snaps shut. Its plastic feels so thin I feared it would crack before the first month was up.

# Sound Quality & Performance

Bass is virtually non-existent, mids are harsh, and treble can pierce your ears on upbeat tracks. These deliver a flat, tinny soundstage that makes every song feel like it‚Äôs played through a coffee can. While¬†**best budget earbuds 2025**¬†contenders often punch above their weight, the kurdene buds fail to redeem the ‚Äútrue wireless‚Äù convenience with any real audio enjoyment.

At low volumes you‚Äôll catch distant dialogue in podcasts, but crank it up and distortion kicks in. For background noise or emergency backup buds, they‚Äôll do‚Äîjust don‚Äôt expect anything beyond muffled audio.

# Comfort & Fit

The generic, round-plastic housing feels bulky in my ears. After 20 minutes, the pressure points build up, making these worse than many wired earbuds I‚Äôve tried. The package includes three silicone tip sizes, but even with the smallest tips the seal is loose, so you lose most bass and wind up readjusting constantly.¬†**Bluetooth earbuds for calls**¬†should stay put during movement‚Äîthese don‚Äôt.

Sweat resistance isn‚Äôt advertised, and you‚Äôll feel moisture slipping around in the drivers within a single sweaty gym set. Comfort? More like continual ear fatigue.

# Battery Life & Charging

Despite the marketing ‚Äú8-hour playtime,‚Äù real-world testing delivered closer to 4-5 hours at moderate volume. The charging case promises an extra 50 hours, but I only managed two full recharges before the case died. The¬†**earbuds battery life under $10**¬†claim is pure fiction‚Äîconsider these a 2-day affair at best before you‚Äôre hunting for a micro-USB cable.

Charging is slow: 2 hours per bud, plus another 3 hours for the case. If you forget to charge overnight, you‚Äôre out of luck for your morning commute.

# Microphone & Call Quality

Call clarity is the weakest link. My voice sounded distant and muffled on the other end, with constant background hiss. Wind or street noise completely overwhelms the tiny mic, making outdoor calls a headache. As¬†**Bluetooth earbuds for calls**, these rate a solid ‚Äúnope.‚Äù

# Pros & Cons

Pros:

* Ultra-low $9.99 price
* True wireless form factor
* Basic hands-free calling
* Three ear tip sizes included

Cons:

* Poor sound quality, tinny audio
* Uncomfortable fit, ear fatigue
* Unreliable Bluetooth connection
* Battery claims wildly exaggerated
* Muffled, low-quality microphone

# Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $9.99, the¬†[kurdene Wireless Earbuds](https://amzn.to/4jrJmoM)¬†undercut even rock-bottom competitors like the Mpow M30 ($19.99) or SoundPEATS TrueFree 2 ($24.99). Call it the ultimate¬†**budget true wireless earbuds**¬†option if you need nothing more than a disposable backup pair. Label it the ‚Äúbudget pick‚Äù for emergency workarounds, but don‚Äôt expect daily-driver reliability.

# Final Verdict & Recommendation

üö´ Would I recommend these to anyone seeking reliable audio on a shoestring? Absolutely not.

These earbuds deliver exactly what you pay for: frustrating controls, weak sound, and exaggerated battery life‚Äînone of which justify the tiny savings. Only consider them if you need a temporary placeholder until you can afford a reputable set.

Having so much invested in a property that we leave often and is frankly too big for us seems wasteful, yet so does paying rent on a smaller property that we wouldn't be at for weeks at a time.  Housing where we live in NE is VERY pricey if you want easy access to Boston Logan.  We are considering buying a small condo somewhere more affordable that we can lock and leave.  Not looking to rent it out.  Any suggestions on MCOL cities with an international airport with flights to LHR that would suit us?  We love outdoor access for walking/hiking, nice motorcycling routes, and good independent coffee shops and restaurants.  So far we've looked at the Charlotte area and have considered Tampa, though the weather there sucks.  East coast is preferred.  Not sure if I'm missing some gem of an area somewhere.  Also looking for tax efficiency as we live on investment income.",20,1748700980.0,fatFIRE,34,0.78,False

1kzy3zo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzy3zo,This has been wonderfull,"Just wanted to share the amazing brew I whipped up using Kasuya's method.

The beans come from Gulmarg Estate in Kyambu, Kenya, harvested at around 1950m above sea level. They're SL28 and SL34 varieties. Medium to dark roast if you ask me.

This was my very first attempt at Kasuya's method. I've been using the V60 for about a week now and the Hoffman method just wasn't cutting it for me. But this? This blew my mind! I simply ground coarser, followed the recipe, and was met with an explosion of flavors in my mouth. I've always been more of a moka pot person than a pour-over enthusiast, but now I'm finally starting to grasp all the passion behind filtered coffee.

I genuinely fell head over heels for this coffee and this method. It's so straightforward, and the results are incredible. I truly wish you could taste, or at least smell, these pictures! I'm definitely falling in love with the V60 now...",7,1748700936.0,pourover,0,0.89,False

I therefore take no responsibility for anyone else's health or well-being: Live your own life, do what's helpful for you,  reject what isn't, leave me out of it either way.

I'm in my 50s, and I noticed a few years back some occasional fogginess when dealing with some of the more abstract concepts of my work. I don't drink coffee and spent a good chunk of my adult life proudly rejecting it. However once I had kids (I was a late-bloomer-Dad), I have found caffeine to be an indispensable part of my daily regimen. Anyway, here's the cocktail of supplements I take and I've observed that my mental acuity has gotten noticeably sharper. It took about two weeks before I noticed a change; but ymmv.

* Caffeine (consumed in tablet form as I still hate the taste of coffee, unless it's ice cream)
* Gaba
* Alpha GPC
* Lion's Mane

Anyway I posted this to be potentially be helpful to others.",15,1748700877.0,GenX,15,0.89,False

this is a project that came in mind .. and I want you to criticize it .. like how can I make it better? 

you can go all the way to even changing the idea .. the techniques .. and please if you could share free online courses to help me survive through this beginners' area that I am in ..
