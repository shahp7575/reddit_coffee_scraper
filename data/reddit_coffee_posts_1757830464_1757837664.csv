I started smoking at 15 and I‚Äôm 46 now ‚Äì that‚Äôs 31 years of smoking. I never smoked regular cigarettes, but I rolled my own tobacco. Rolling, coffee, and that first morning smoke on the balcony‚Ä¶ it was my sacred ritual, something I truly loved.

So why did I finally quit? The main reason: anxiety. I realized that every morning I woke up calm and peaceful. But the moment I lit up my first cigarette, anxiety came crashing in. I could literally feel it rising with every drag ‚Äì worries about work, projects, the future, relationships ‚Äì all of it, before I even finished the first cigarette of the day.

Years ago, I already quit caffeine because it triggered the same anxious feelings. I still love coffee, but only drink decaf most of the time. The last few years I even had panic attacks (3 in total). The worst one happened while driving on the highway ‚Äì I had to pull over and lie in the grass for an hour just to calm down.

Recently, I noticed more wheezing in my lungs, scary moments, and my skin was aging badly ‚Äì turning dull, gray, tired. Even creams didn‚Äôt help. A medical checkup showed the early stage of COPD, lung function at 75%. That scared me, but not enough to quit. Deep down, I think I was preparing for it, because last year I smoked more than ever, like I was ‚Äústocking up‚Äù before stopping.

The thing is, I live a pretty healthy life otherwise ‚Äì good food, swimming twice a week, running, lifting weights, loving family, good job, friends. And I still loved smoking. I smoked while driving, socializing, or just alone. But the anxiety, the headaches, the brain fog, the mood swings‚Ä¶ I knew I was destroying myself.

I tried quitting once before and lasted 1 month, but back then I felt miserable, like a victim, always missing my cigarettes. This time it‚Äôs different. On Sunday, August 31, I smoked my last cigarette as a kind of ritual. Since September 1, I haven‚Äôt smoked at all.

The first 3 days were tough, but since then it‚Äôs been so much better. I didn‚Äôt change anything in my daily life. I still go out for coffee with coworkers (they smoke, I don‚Äôt). I went out for drinks with friends (they smoke, I don‚Äôt). I also read Allen Carr‚Äôs book and it helped a lot. I stay motivated by reading Reddit stories and watching YouTube testimonies.

But here‚Äôs the biggest win: from day 1, my anxiety disappeared. Completely gone. No more fear, no headaches, my productivity shot up, I‚Äôm calmer in conversations, no arguments at home, I leave work with a clear head and more done. I can even drink 5 real coffees a day now and feel perfectly fine ‚Äì which means it was the cigarettes all along.

I already feel like I‚Äôve made a real change. I don‚Äôt see myself ever going back. One comment I read here really stuck with me:

‚ÄúI lived the first half of my life with cigarettes ‚Äì I partied, loved, cried, and lived fully with them, no regrets. Now I want to try living the second half fully without them, to see all the beauty of life on the other side.‚Äù

That‚Äôs exactly how I feel right now. Wishing all of you strength on your journey. If I can do it after 31 years, so can you.",2,1757836785.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

What looked like just another dead meme turned out to be one of the cleanest setups I‚Äôve seen in this space.

TLDR at the end

Here‚Äôs why I‚Äôm bullish:

**On-chain stats**
	
‚Ä¢	59% of supply hasn‚Äôt moved in over a year
	
‚Ä¢	77% hasn‚Äôt moved in over 6 months

‚Ä¢	Only ~10% of supply sits in LPs or CEX wallets

‚Ä¢	HHI score is 27 ‚Üí more decentralized than most memes, and even lower concentration than some bluechips

**Distribution & whales**

‚Ä¢	Old whales are gone ‚Üí supply got redistributed into thousands of EOAs

‚Ä¢	No dev stash, no whale cartel ready to dump the chart

‚Ä¢	Broader base of holders = stronger floor and organic stability

**Chart structure**

‚Ä¢	Price action looks exactly like a Wyckoff accumulation

‚Ä¢	Pump ‚Üí dump ‚Üí long sideways base ‚Üí float tightening

‚Ä¢	Normally this is engineered by market makers, here it happened naturally because the community held

**Narrative & culture**

‚Ä¢	 isn‚Äôt just a ticker, it‚Äôs a cultcoin/brandcoin

‚Ä¢	Real-world brands already spinning up: Kendu coffee, Kendu beer, Kendu energy
	
‚Ä¢	The culture gives it stickiness way beyond price speculation

**Listings potential**

‚Ä¢	No insider allocations

‚Ä¢	If CEXes want it, they‚Äôll need to buy straight off the market like everyone else

**Security**

‚Ä¢	Fully verified on CertiK Skynet (free community vote, only PEPE managed that before)

‚Ä¢	All flagged issues resolved ‚Üí contract is safe

To me, that combination is rare. Locked supply, organic decentralization, cult-like brand growth, and a chart base that looks textbook Wyckoff. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm loading in heavy.

‚∏ª

TLDR:
Kendu has 59% of supply untouched for over a year, 77% for 6+ months, HHI score 27, no dev stash, no whale cartel, only ~10% in LPs/CEX wallets. Add in cultcoin branding and CertiK verification and it looks like one of those once-a-cycle setups.

Eventually I managed to import a small batch, just 2.5 kgs total, split between two different varieties. 500gms roasted, and 2kgs raw green beans.

I‚Äôve been trying 500gms roasted coffee and the flavors are really unique compared to what I usually drink. Since this sub is full of folks who enjoy exploring different coffees, I thought it‚Äôd be fun to share some with anyone interested, rather than keeping it all to myself.

Just to be clear, these are green beans (not roasted yet). The beans are packed and fresh, never opened them. So you‚Äôd need to roast them yourself before brewing.

I‚Äôm not running a brand or anything, just a coffee lover who got curious and imported these beans for personal use. But since the rules here say if I‚Äôm sharing/selling something I need to mention a price:
	‚Ä¢	I spent ‚Çπ8k in total (beans + shipping).
	‚Ä¢	If anyone wants to try, I‚Äôm happy to share at ‚Çπ300 per 100g.

I only have 1 kg of each variety, so 2 kg total to share. If a few of you are up for trying, I‚Äôd really love to hear your thoughts on how you find the flavour.

There‚Äôs a lot, so I‚Äôll just start with the small changes I made day-to-day.

# My daily routine

* I try to sleep at least 8h (9h is even better).
* First thing in the morning, I check my temperature (more on that later).
* Then I drink warm water with a ginger cube I make myself (blend ginger, lemon, turmeric + black pepper, freeze it).
* Breakfast has to be high protein: usually 3 eggs with avocado, or oats with cinnamon, chia + protein powder, or blended flax seeds cooked with almond milk,¬† protein powder and sugarfree chocolate. (btw ginger, lemon, cinnamon are antioxidants = fight inflammation).

Lunch is after 3‚Äì4h. Anything goes as long as it‚Äôs high in fiber + protein.

Dinner is usually 5‚Äì6h later, still high in protein but I let myself have more carbs at night since it helps with sleep.

If I overdo carbs/sugar, I‚Äôll go for a walk (even just pacing around the house for 10 minutes lol since I WFH) ‚Äî it helps with glucose/insulin levels.



# Supplements (my basics)

Obviously this depends on the person, but here‚Äôs what I take daily:

* Vit D3 after breakfast (4k IU but I skip if I spent at least 40min in the sun bc I live in Singapore and it's quite easy to get enough sun)
* Omega 3 (make sure the ratio is 500 EPA : 250 DHA)
* B-complex in the morning (gives energy bc it affects the nervous system)
* Magnesium 2h before bed (calms me and helps with cramps bc it lowers cortisol)
* Zinc (better ovulation)
* Myo-inositol (40:1 ratio with D-chiro) before sleep, helps with REM sleep, I take 2g bc I learnt how to control my sugar level but even 4g is recommended
* Spearmint (for testosterone) usually after ovulation



Other stuff I add in: sodium butyrate for gut health. If I feel low on iron I‚Äôll take 1g vitamin C before eating iron-rich meal. If I feel sick ‚Üí 1g vit C x 3 a day + more vit D.

# Food & lifestyle tips

* More protein + healthy fats = less sugar cravings.
* In luteal phase/period ‚Üí cut down on caffeine (cortisol is already high).
* Seed cycling: pumpkin seeds in follicular, sesame + sunflower in luteal.
* Alcohol = inflammation + stress. I don‚Äôt drink at all, it's worth cutting down.



# Tracking temperature

This one was a game changer for me! My cycles used to be all over the place, I never knew when my period was coming. I thought ‚Äútracking temperature‚Äù was only for trying to conceive, but it‚Äôs actually so useful. After 2‚Äì3 months of doing it daily, I learned my pattern and now I know exactly when to expect my period (and it‚Äôs super helpful if you‚Äôre TTC).

How I do it:

* I take my temp every morning right after waking up, within the same 30 min window, after at least 5h of sleep.
* Use a digital thermometer (I use Microlife).
* You‚Äôre looking for a temp rise of 0.2‚Äì0.6¬∞C, which means ovulation. The temp stays higher until period.
* PCOS cycles can still have ovulation even if they‚Äôre long (like day 30+).
* 18+ days of high temp = possible pregnancy.
* Low temp (<36.2) = maybe thyroid/nutrient issue.
* Big temp swings daily = high cortisol.



# Exercise

More doesn‚Äôt mean better! With PCOS, high cortisol is an issue, so I try to:

* Do higher intensity / weights after period until a week after ovulation.
* Luteal phase = yoga, lighter weights, longer breaks.
* No workouts on day 1‚Äì3 of period.
* Walk daily (5‚Äì10k steps if possible).
* Walk 10‚Äì15min after meals ‚Üí helps with insulin.



# Random but important tips

* Pads/tampons ‚Üí get 100% cotton, no bleach.
* Eat a big variety of veggies (fiber helps with digestion and guts like variety).
* A raw carrot in the morning helps with hormones.
* Avoid screens 1h before bed.
* Dairy & sugar make my acne worse, so I cut them \~90%.
* Bone broth = amazing superfood, if you can make it.
* If dieting, do it in follicular phase. In luteal, eat 300‚Äì500 kcal more.



# Extra little things:

* Eat breakfast within 60 min of waking. No coffee first thing ‚Üí wait 30 min after food.
* If you wake up hungry = good sign.
* Drink green tea before coffee ‚Üí smooths out the energy crash.
* Green tea daily = strong antioxidant.
* If you‚Äôre low on iron, avoid coffee/tea 30 min before & after meals.
* Meal order matters ‚Üí veggies/fiber first, then fats/protein, carbs last.
* Don‚Äôt take iron supplements unless you really need to.



That‚Äôs everything I could think of now¬†¬†but honestly there‚Äôs more. Let me know if you do any of these too and if they help you!¬†

  
I've spent millioooons of hours learning these things and a lot more things but it would be too long. If this is helpful for even one person I would be already happy. Let me know what you think! ",2,1757836157.0,PCOS,0,0.75,False

So, I was in cp and went to indian coffee house alone as it was near Hanuman mandir too. As I sat there it was sort of empty at that point of time there was a old man sitting there reading a book, I recieved a call from an acquaintance she was asking me about the current political situation and i am mostly a right winger, i told her the situation as per my view as she said she had to write a article on bihar election before Monday. As I said earlier I told her everything and after the call ended the Old man was having a smirk on his face and like that he came and sat near me.


He asked my name what do I do and the usual and he introduced himself first he said "" i liked your view beta "" I felt happy and proud inside.
He further said that "" i have been a former communist and congressi , he said he worked under Indira Gandhi, Rajiv gandhi, IK Gujral and the Manmohan government. "" And said that the youngsters or the ones who abuse the ruling party today have not even seen one percent of the time when congress and communist were at there peak. He said today no one wants to read ir try to grab the mood of the people who actually matter the working class. He further said aaj kal everyone is a political expert having zero knowledge or sense. I felt bad at this but understood why he would have said it. And we had a convo for next 4 hours what was supposed to be a normal coffee break turned into a great day.


He gave me a life lesson he said that the ones who shout the most are the most hollow within and don't have the courage or sense to stand up. I as a child compared to his age got to learn a lot and felt that people like him are needed more in the society. ",0,1757835990.0,delhi,1,0.5,False

1ngl2yo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngl2yo,"51 years , still yesterday I made 33.","Went to my favourite restaurant in Marbella (SKINA) and had an outstanding experience.
Food and service were truly Excelsior, and Marcos once again brought out those magical liquids‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt take tons of pictures this time, as I usually do, but those two‚Ä¶ oh lord.

First, an Ech√©zeaux by n√©gociant Paul Compain. Back in those days he managed to secure paperwork that linked the wine to parcels now considered among the four best of the cru. 

From the very first glass it roared like a panther  bursts of fruit that, within just ten minutes, transformed into tertiary layers: like stepping into an old cigar lounge filled with polished wood, leather, and freshly ground coffee.

 Damn‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt even attempt DRC again until I can line them up side by side. 

The 1974 Ech√©zeaux was playing poker through the main courses, bluffing and revealing with every sip. The colour seemed to deepen with oxygenation or was it just my imagination? 

Either way, it was pure delight to witness what a bottle carrying 51 years of history can still deliver. Sharing it with the dining room team made it even more special  the young staff were mesmerized by the chocolate-like aromas rising from their glasses.

And then, our favourite Sauternes‚Ä¶ 2010. Refined, not yet wearing that deep golden robe, but instead brimming with flowers, candied orange, and stone fruits wrapped in molasses. 

I expected greatness, yet it still surprised me.

I hope you enjoy these pictures and my attempt to capture the experience as much as I did living it.

I wanna say the chicken talked to him to try to convince him not to cook him, and whenever one of the other characters entered the room it was conveniently silent, so everyone thought he was crazy or lying. Then at the end, the guy's friends walk in and see the chicken alone on the table, pecking at the clothes of the guy, and they are like ""Hey, where did what's his face go? Well, whatever, let's go out to eat."" Or something along those lines.  
I thought it was The Amanda Show, but no amount of looking through episode/sketch lists got me anything similar to that. I tried asking copilot, and searching online, but couldn't find anything.  
I remember the set fairly well. It was a living room area, with a couch and a coffee table. The colors were warm from what I recall, like oranges, tans and browns. There was a door to the right of the couch area, that might have lead upstairs, and characters came in and out of it throughout the scene.  
I've been trying to figure this out for days now, because I was telling my little brother about it, and how I was kinda freaked out by it when I was little, and was so certain it was The Amanda Show, but couldn't find anything on it.  
The only other context I can give is that it was most likely around 2005ish because the place we were living at the time was where we got our GameCube, and we were poor, so we likely got the GameCube a few years after the initial release.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I was really weirded out by this and refused to do it. 

I was working for a bit by myself when someone turned extra lights on and I realized the room I was in was also coffee shop too. I asked the person who came in what was going on and they told me to just close the curtain so I could take their order. It dawned on me that they expected me to help in the morgue and then go open this coffee shop too. So in a panic, I closed the curtains dividing the morgue from the coffee shop, scrubbed the hell out of my hands and then tried to run the coffee shop too but it was so overwhelming busy and I was worried about the body I had left on the table behind the curtain. 

Eventually, I ran out to the hallway looking for any kind of help and stumbled upon my boss who brought a new hire to help me in the coffee shop.

1ngkvag,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1ngkvag/question_about_ketoacidosis/,Question about Ketoacidosis,"I‚Äôm doing my first ever water fast. I‚Äôm at 77-78 hours since my last meal. I was going to break the fast in approximately 10 hours after church.

I‚Äôve been having exclusively water and black coffee (3 and a half cups today before 2 pm), with unflavored LMNT packets. The first two days I had 2 packets per day, today I had a little bit over 1 packet. I also walked for an hour today and yesterday.

I had been feeling surprisingly decent today, and had even considered extending to a 5 day fast. I was feeling ready for bed though, and laid down to sleep. A couple hours later I awoke feeling alert, like it was morning and I‚Äôd slept a long time. I also had a mild air hunger taking a deep breath. Pulse was 72.

I remembered something I‚Äôd read on ketoacidosis from fasting so got on the phone to read more and as I read about the dangers I started getting panicky, pulse sped up, air hunger worsened.

I started drinking 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in water in case I was acidic and I called the free nurse line and as we spoke my symptoms improved a bit. She said if I have any air hunger to go to the hospital.

My GF is a T1D and leaves a blood sugar testing kit here. I tested and it was 82. I also started on a second glass of water with another 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. My pulse has come back to 72.

1. I guess I‚Äôm trying to determine whether a person would be at risk for this without diabetes. (I haven‚Äôt had a physical yet this year and so I guess having type 2 diabetes could be possible).

2. I‚Äôm also wondering how I would know if I actually needed the hospital from something like that without ketone test strips. (I‚Äôm currently seeing if any 24/7 pharmacies carry them)

3. I‚Äôm wondering how a person can mitigate their ketones during a fast and if drinking baking soda really helps. 

4. Lastly I‚Äôm wondering if breaking this fast now would be enough to reverse ketone buildup, if it isn‚Äôt yet at a dangerous level.

As I‚Äôve typed the air hunger has continued receding now to a very minimal level and my adrenaline seems to be normalizing mostly. I‚Äôm feeling cold now, but my house was also set to 65 degrees. I‚Äôve just turned it to 70 to see if that helps the temperature. Finally, I haven‚Äôt had a bowel movement the last two days but I had assumed that was normal for not eating anything",0,1757834870.0,fasting,1,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Minsan, natutulog ako halos buong shift tapos ginagawa ko na lang after shift yung mga tasks. Last week, umabot na sa point na may mga tasks akong na-miss for the whole week.

Nag-try pa ako bumili ng meds na may ashwagandha (para mawala anxiety and boost energy) pero honestly wala talagang effect.

Now I‚Äôm stuck thinking:
	‚Ä¢	Dapat ba magpalit ako ng work environment (like coffee shop or co-working space)?
	‚Ä¢	Or kailangan ko lang maging disciplined at iwas sa phone kasi yun yung main distraction?

Anyone here naka-experience ng ganito? Paano niyo na-regain yung productivity niyo after burnout or distractions?

Once you see these patterns, you can't unsee them.

1. People say yes to those they like.¬†Seems obvious, but watch how salespeople mirror your body language, find common ground, or give genuine compliments before asking for anything. Works every single time.

2. We feel obligated to return favors.¬†Someone gives you something small and free? You suddenly feel like you owe them. This is why car dealerships offer free coffee and real estate agents bring cookies to open houses.

3. Social proof runs everything.¬†""Most popular item,"" ""4.8 stars,"" ""other customers also bought"" - we look to others to decide what's normal or right. Even fake reviews work because our brains default to following the crowd.

4. Authority makes us compliance machines.¬†Put someone in a uniform, give them a title, or mention their credentials and people will follow almost any instruction. It's scary how much we shut off critical thinking around perceived experts.

5. Scarcity creates instant desire.¬†""Limited time offer,"" ""only 3 left in stock,"" ""exclusive access"" suddenly you want something you didn't care about 5 minutes ago. Our brains are wired to want what we might lose.

6. Commitment and consistency trap us.¬†Once you agree to something small, you'll do almost anything to stay consistent with that identity. This is how cults work, but also how gym memberships and political campaigns get you hooked.

7. Reciprocation works even when you don't want the initial favor.¬†Someone does something ""nice"" for you that you never asked for? You still feel obligated to return it. Manipulative people exploit this constantly.

Once I learned this stuff, I started noticing it everywhere. Marketing emails, political ads, even friends and family use these tactics (probably without realizing it).

You become basically immune to most manipulation once you recognize the patterns. Haven't fallen for a sales pitch in months.

I learned this the snacky way. Here is my people friendly checklist with the exact spots where Vendekin helps me prove a location before my ego and wallet get hurt.

**The quick vibe check:**

People are present and they stay a little. A busy hallway is a museum tour. A break room or study zone is a snack trap.  
You can see the machine from ten steps away. If it hides behind a ficus, it will also hide your profits.  
There is a small pain you solve. Long lines, closed cafe, no change, only one water point far away.

**What I literally do on site:**

Count heads for five minutes. If I get bored counting, that is good news.  
Check power and mobile signal. Vendekin works with tap and UPI and needs a decent connection. The app pings me if the machine goes offline, so I do not discover trouble from an angry text.  
Ask for a short trial. With vNetra I watch live sales and stock on my phone during week one. If the numbers yawn, I move on politely.

**Why a smart setup helps you win the pitch:**

Hosts love zero effort. I tell them it is cashless and I handle restocks and cleaning. Vendekin gives simple alerts for stock out and temperature so I fix things before anyone complains.  
Refunds are fast and clean. Vend checks and auto retry reduce those awkward please shake the machine moments.  
Old cabinet on site. No problem. Vendekin can retrofit an existing machine to make it smart which makes the yes easier.

**How I tune the machine to the crowd:**

Office break room. Duplicate water and the top cola. With vNetra I see the two top sellers by day three and copy them to more rows.  
Gym or training center. Keep energy small and add protein bars and nuts. I nudge prices from my phone and watch what sticks.  
Campus or hostel. Late night traffic is real. Cup noodles and small energy cans move. The app shows hour by hour sales so I stock right before peak.

**Green flags I trust:**

People sit or wait at least ten minutes  
Clear sight line and safe lighting  
No competing food within ten steps  
A manager who replies with yes or no and not maybe next month

**Red flags that fooled me once:**  
  
Fancy lobby with a cafe next door  
Signal is patchy and everyone lives on cash  
The spot looks great in photos but footfall vanishes after lunch

**My wins and faceplants:**

Win. Mid size office break room. Vendekin showed steady sales from water, cola, classic chips, and one chocolate. Break even felt boring and that is exactly what I want.

Faceplant. Beautiful lobby that was basically a catwalk for coffee drinkers. vNetra numbers were sad by day three and I pulled out at the end of the trial.

1ngkdxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ngkdxa/there_is_something_at_the_bottom_of_bikini_atoll/,There is something at the bottom of Bikini Atoll.,"On July 3, 1946, Harry S Truman gave the green light for operation crossroads, a nuclear weapons test conducted at Bikini Atoll to supposedly investigate the effects of nuclear weapons on warships. Two experiments were set up, Able and Baker. Able used a fat-manesque nuke called Gilda, named after some old 50‚Äôs movie. The bomb didn‚Äôt do much damage to the warships, sure most of them were contaminated with nuclear debris but nothing noticeable happened on the surface. However, the ocean floor sustained heavy devastation. Displacing several metric tons of sand and dirt creating a rather large crater. The second bomb in the Baker test was similar and was known as Helen of bikini.

¬†It further deepened Bikini Atoll into the nuclear wasteland we know today by extending the nuclear waste into the oceans. It also deepened the crater made by the previous bomb. From that dug out an unfathomable horror peaked it‚Äôs eerie head into our world. Laying the foundations for Armageddon.

However, the end will not come from a Lovecraftian sea monster, or a forgotten race of sentient fish people, or even a beacon that leads a gigantic fleet of aliens to our solar system. Something so intrinsic to human endeavor as the apocalypse shall not be affiliated with anything so clich√©, so obvious and simple, something so human. The cause of our eventual downfall will be a little TV show called SpongeBob SquarePants.

It all started when I got a message, I was working at Nickelodeon studios, the one in Burbank, as a janitor. The year was 1995, when the studio was making classics like Ren and Stimpy and Rocko‚Äôs modern life, three years before the end. I was down on my luck with money. Recently fired and with bills stacking up I went to the newspapers for an answer. Low and behold I got a job cleaning after the guys who made childhoods.

Entering the building for the first time was complete sensory overload. Walls were plastered with orange splats, cut outs of cartoon characters were at every corner, and the furniture, man the furniture was stripped right out of a Dr. Seuss book. Big winding arches of blue plastic and zigzags that held tables. A real maximalist style that present day companies severely lacked. The place also radiated some sense of child like wonder. It felt like I was walking around a toddler coloring book if the toddler was good at drawing. It was a nice place to work in, which is what I‚Äôm saying. Then after about a month and a half, Almighty Neptune came.

A moss-filled Colosseum stood before me, and in it lay a throne covered in barnacles. The man sat on this throne was seemingly made of pure white marble. The little light that reached this ethereal palace gave this figure a harsh shadow that roughly outlined the geometry of his face. It made him look angry. Maybe he was looking back on it. I was intruding on his territory. A mere mortal showing himself to a god.

I stood there for seconds scanning the area around me like a foreigner in the slums of a country. My adrenaline shot up and I screamed but what came out wasn‚Äôt a high-pitched call of distress. What came out was bubbles. I was underwater. Somehow, I was underwater for what seemed to be a couple of minutes, yet I did not drown. Flailing my arms up and down I found that there was no heavy resistance in movement the way you would usually move in water. Looking around, experimenting with movement, hearing any possible signs of life other than that statue. I knew it was watching me, I knew it was angry, I knew a whole lot of things in that situation, the most prominent one was that I was screwed beyond everything we knew about anything. I tried my best to evade any image of this towering monstrosity that watched my every move. My life came to me in pieces. Disjointed but connected in a way. I was going to die here.

He was gone, taking the little light that was here with him. The moment I looked away from this thing it just vanishes away like it never existed. Then music. A sort of ambience that only fine dining places have. An orchestra playing a composition from the eighteen hundreds. There was the sharp noise of violins, The booming and tip taps of drums. What really caught my attention was the overpowering tooting sound. The main instrument that was leading the melody of the entire composition. A trumpet or a saxophone, some brass instrument. It pierced through my ears leading me to something behind the throne.

A massive pit was the source of the music. Cartoonishly large, jagged shapes that lost it‚Äôs clear definition the deeper you investigate the hole.

¬†I don‚Äôt know why I jumped in. Everything was so loose and wavy like I was back in 1987, doing L.S.D. in a Macdonald‚Äôs drive through.

The fall didn‚Äôt feel like a fall. It felt like I jumped over a porch step. The next thing I know I was greeted with large grey cylinders, the size of skyscrapers. There wasn‚Äôt any definition in this tube-shaped building, no windows or doors of any kind. A smooth surface all throughout.

The music was louder now but it was still far away from me. The large cylinders that laid around me were echoing this sound making it seem as though it came from every direction. I was lost in a cacophony of confusion. What would happen to me in this void beneath the sea. What would happen to me? My answer came in the form of a squirrel. Hurrying in its scurry movements, it stopped its journey and faced it‚Äôs eyes towards mine. A galaxy was in those eyes. Then it continued to move. I followed suit moving quickly to match the squirrels speed. Left and right in a broken zigzag pattern. The path was anything but straight forward. We were running in circles but there wasn‚Äôt a definite way to confirm that, there wasn‚Äôt anyway to mark our previous location because every cylinder looked Identical to one another.

I glanced back and I saw fish. They were as large as elephants, and they were charging towards me. We were being chased. I picked up the pace a lot more to the point where I was almost behind my furry friend. A few lefts and a handful of rights later we were out of the field of metal tubes. Then it stopped. Looking back, I saw the fish hiding behind their metallic abode, peaking their bulging eyes at us, staring.

The music was close now. Every step made it louder and louder. The squirrel was on my shoulders; the only sense of comfort I had in this winding world I found myself in.

Just a couple of steps to go and I‚Äôll reach the song that plagued me so. A small hill was left on our list of obstacles and each inch I climbed was a small victory for me. It was a rough couple of steps. When the floor is made of coarse sand your feet start to sink a little but, in this case, it was more than a little. It almost swallowed my whole leg. Soon enough my entire body was engulfed in sand. First my leg, then my torso, and finally my neck. My body felt every tingle of this, sending signals to my brain to stop, but I can‚Äôt. The music was so beautiful. It grew louder than it ever did. It was coming from the ground now.

A banquet. I was seated at the farthest golden, jewel-crested chair on a dark mahogany table to the left. There were about thirty to forty seats total. Some were occupied by a race of gelatinous, translucent figures with exposed brains and floating eyeballs wearing silvery cloaks. Some were hard looking, the way a crab looks when it‚Äôs been boiled for a couple of hours, with fangs coming out of their eye holes and tongues growing out from their eyebrows. Then a gorilla. He looked quite dapper with his velvet coat and top hat. Along with his diamond monocle.

A projection manifested itself to my right side. The ones that theaters use for old timey movies, I was glued to the screen so to speak. A series of photos were shown every five seconds or so. They had pictures of me. Way back when I was a kid. Still none the wiser of all the grotesque things in this world. A picture of me at the water park, a picture of me graduating high school, a picture of me and my father. Then there were pictures of someone else‚Äôs life. As the pictures went on the colors of each of them became less saturated with color. Each one duller than the other until there wasn‚Äôt any color in the pictures. They had the same subject, people in normal situations. Then they had pictures of soldiers, generals, and government officials all around an oval table, all of them pointing at me. Pictures of people with hazmat suits entering what looks like grey water. Submarine telescopes were around them waiting for the men to descend to their deaths.

That picture lingered longer than most of them. Every detail popped out of the screen. So much so that I could almost hear the ocean‚Äôs waves crashing along the shores. By then I was no longer entranced with this little picture show. I glanced around me, and every figure on this table was just staring at the projections. Everyone except the gorilla. The sheer amount of swagger and potency of his properness was enough for me to infer the fact that he was the host of this event. A meeting between multi-universal beings. He tipped his hat to me, raising his eyebrow and holding a V-shaped grin.

‚ÄúWell, well, well. I‚Äôve been expecting you Mr. You surely are one illusive man to follow.‚Äù

He spoke, though he didn‚Äôt open his mouth, he spoke like a radio show host. He didn‚Äôt even walk like a gorilla. He was walking upright with no hint of any sort of stumbling. As if he was merely a man in a gorilla costume. I tried to speak but only bubbles escaped my mouth.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the indignity of your arrival. The chauffeur didn‚Äôt arrive on time, so I had to make a little request to the boss. You may ask me any questions of the nature of your visit.‚Äù

Tapping my fingers on the table in a fit of nervousness. I was sitting with my legs apart and my head down in contemplation. I didn‚Äôt even think about all the weird things that happened today. I was working my shift mopping up floors and cleaning toilets and next I was talking to a gorilla in a clean velvet coat. There wasn‚Äôt any connection to any of the occurrences that happened today. It was all just a string of weird random things on top of weird random things. I really didn‚Äôt have any choice but to follow any semblance of normalcy in this place and that lead me here. Retracing my steps from this day was a task that involved a mountain of focus, but I pulled through. I wasn‚Äôt going to follow along with anything anymore. I got out of bed and rubbed my eyes, then I took a shower and commuted to work. An old man with a raggedy beard and a hook for a hand sat next to me on the bus. He asked me where the sea was. I ignored him. I arrived on the job at about nine to nine thirty A.M., and I went to the break room to grab myself a cup of coffee. I worked until my shift was over and took the bus. I sat on my couch for a while and then I drifted to sleep-

‚ÄúNo Sir. This is no dream. This place is just as real as any place you‚Äôve ever been in. With its charms and less favorable parts. This is no hell either nor a twisted rendition of heaven or any depiction of the afterlife. You are very much alive. The reason for your visit is beyond your comprehension and frankly is far beyond ours. It simply just happened I suppose.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook at the screen sir. You‚Äôll understand everything once you‚Äôve seen this image. Every moment has led up to this point.‚Äù

Upon looking I saw a soft looking blob in the middle of a large crater. The blob had a bunch of holes plastered on every surface of it. My eyes were stuck. Tears came out.

‚ÄúYou see Mr. you are so very lucky. You‚Äôll witness the exact moment where your species will evolve into something newer, more efficient and whole. No need to breathe or eat or drink, or sleep, no need for any meaning whatsoever. You will exist and that will be enough for you. Your physical, mental, and psychological limitations will be a small piece of the past. Every member of your race will undergo these changes and soon you will no longer consider yourselves human.‚Äù

Dead is what he meant. We would all die.

‚ÄúNo, No, No sir. Dying is a small part of the process. A mere nexus to a greater plan, and it will all be voluntary. All we did was show you a speck of what‚Äôs going to come. You will see us very soon.‚Äù

My gaze was broken from the image, and I could finally look around. Every where I looked was a metallic man. They all had the same design. A thick brown suit with a copper helmet with a dark black glass panel for a face. The only light in the room came from the projection so only a handful were shown to me, but I could tell that there were more.

‚ÄúVery, very soon.‚Äù

The projector stopped. Black covered my eyes.

I was sitting on my lazy boy. My very expensive and very wet lazy boy. I was just as wet if not even more.

A dead squirrel wearing a velvet suit was lying on my hand. I chucked it out the window upon noticing the creature.

Everywhere I looked there was something strange. A pirate here and there with the same question, where is the ocean. A bulging eye appeared every time I glanced at a corner. I came to work, and I saw a brightly colored sponge wearing a boxy white shirt, brown shorts, and a red tie. Incredibly comical. I went to every library I could dig up any strand of information that could lead me to any form of answer. I got what I was asking for. Bikini Atoll was the genesis of it all. The bombs made something come out and it has quietly influenced our history. Increasing political tension and multiplying hate and scorn for us to destroy ourselves with the same weapons that disturbed it‚Äôs slumber. I believe SpongeBob is the latest of its efforts. Infecting the youth with this virus.

Now I‚Äôve quit my job. I‚Äôve been living as a homeless man for a while now, typing this on a stolen phone. I still have those weird things happening around me. I probably had a weird aneurysm of some sort; it probably wasn‚Äôt real. If it was It will continue. I don‚Äôt know how long but it will continue until every single one of us has been swallowed by the water.",2,1757833183.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False
1ngkddv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1ngkddv/when_my_cat_judges_me/,When My Cat Judges Me,"She perches on the high altar of the bookshelf,
eyes twin moons cutting through the fog of my inertia,
tail curled like a question mark punctuating my failures.
I shuffle through my mundane rituals,
spooning cereal like a monk spooning ash,
and she is the cathedral‚Äôs shadow,
silent yet seismic,
measuring my sin in the quiet geometry of her stare.

Her whiskers twitch like the antennae of an interstellar oracle,
decoding the cosmic banality of my Netflix devotion,
the way I cradle cups of lukewarm coffee
as though they could baptize me into significance.
She judges the cadence of my sighs,
the crooked angles of my posture,
mapping my guilt with the precision of a cartographer
charting the tectonic plates of human weakness.

In her gaze, a symphony of jagged glass:
each reflection shards my excuses
until I am a mosaic of shame and longing.
Her fur glimmers like the charred edges of a myth,
smoke rising from some forgotten legend of dignity,
and I, a hapless Icarus,
have clipped my wings on the ceiling fan of domesticity.

She is both jury and jury-rigged executioner,
a liquid constellation of judgment,
pawing at the constellation of my laziness,
and I‚Äî
a flickering candle in her cathedral‚Äî
burn unevenly,
knowing she sees every carbonized truth,
every ember of self-deception,
every half-formed promise
like a hawk sees the twitch of a mouse.

I want to tell her I am more than my messy habits,

My (29M) partner's (26F) birthday is November 16th. I've always gone all out for her birthday (we're going on 5 years in December) and this year, I'm just looking for some ideas that are new and exciting. We have certain birthday traditions that we do every year (her favorite breakfast spot, walking through a cemetery, shopping spree at a Wicca stor) but I always try to find a new fun activity. Ive got a couple already but I wanna see if people have more suggestions!

Some info about her/us:

‚Ä¢ We live in the Denver area of Colorado but I have a car and can drive anywhere

‚Ä¢ We both have been sober since we've been together

‚Ä¢ I'm not super wealthy but not exactly on the poverty line, I have a lot of money put away for her birthday

‚Ä¢ She is a HUGE fan of movies, mostly horror but loves anything David Lynch, Ari Aster, Yorgos Lanthimos to name a few

‚Ä¢ We both love dead things (taxidermy, cemeteries, ghost tours)

‚Ä¢ She loves art and photography

‚Ä¢ We love food, coffee, tea

‚Ä¢ Animal lovers

‚Ä¢ She's obsessed with Deftones, Chelsea Wolfe, Employed to Serve

That's I think the most pertinent info I can think of! Happy to answer any other questions and for anyone who offers suggestions, sincerely, thank you for helping me make it a super special day!",0,1757833052.0,AskAGoth,0,0.33,False

1ngkbmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ngkbmg/there_is_something_at_the_bottom_of_bikini_atoll/,There is something at the bottom of bikini atoll,"On July 3, 1946, Harry S Truman gave the green light for operation crossroads, a nuclear weapons test conducted at Bikini Atoll to supposedly investigate the effects of nuclear weapons on warships. Two experiments were set up, Able and Baker. Able used a fat-manesque nuke called Gilda, named after some old 50‚Äôs movie. 

The bomb didn‚Äôt do much damage to the warships, sure most of them were contaminated with nuclear debris but nothing noticeable happened on the surface. However, the ocean floor sustained heavy devastation. Displacing several metric tons of sand and dirt creating a rather large crater. The second bomb in the Baker test was similar and was known as Helen of bikini.

¬†It further deepened Bikini Atoll into the nuclear wasteland we know today by extending the nuclear waste into the oceans. It also deepened the crater made by the previous bomb. From that dug out an unfathomable horror peaked it‚Äôs eerie head into our world. Laying the foundations for Armageddon.

However, the end will not come from a Lovecraftian sea monster, or a forgotten race of sentient fish people, or even a beacon that leads a gigantic fleet of aliens to our solar system. Something so intrinsic to human endeavor as the apocalypse shall not be affiliated with anything so clich√©, so obvious and simple, something so human. The cause of our eventual downfall will be a little TV show called SpongeBob SquarePants.

It all started when I got a message, I was working at Nickelodeon studios, the one in Burbank, as a janitor. The year was 1995, when the studio was making classics like Ren and Stimpy and Rocko‚Äôs modern life, three years before the end. I was down on my luck with money. Recently fired and with bills stacking up I went to the newspapers for an answer. Low and behold I got a job cleaning after the guys who made childhoods.

Entering the building for the first time was complete sensory overload. Walls were plastered with orange splats, cut outs of cartoon characters were at every corner, and the furniture, man the furniture was stripped right out of a Dr. Seuss book. Big winding arches of blue plastic and zigzags that held tables. A real maximalist style that present day companies severely lacked. The place also radiated some sense of child like wonder. It felt like I was walking around a toddler coloring book if the toddler was good at drawing. It was a nice place to work in, which is what I‚Äôm saying. Then after about a month and a half, Almighty Neptune came.

A moss-filled Colosseum stood before me, and in it lay a throne covered in barnacles. The man sat on this throne was seemingly made of pure white marble. The little light that reached this ethereal palace gave this figure a harsh shadow that roughly outlined the geometry of his face. It made him look angry. Maybe he was looking back on it. I was intruding on his territory. A mere mortal showing himself to a god.

I stood there for seconds scanning the area around me like a foreigner in the slums of a country. My adrenaline shot up and I screamed but what came out wasn‚Äôt a high-pitched call of distress. What came out was bubbles. I was underwater. Somehow, I was underwater for what seemed to be a couple of minutes, yet I did not drown. Flailing my arms up and down I found that there was no heavy resistance in movement the way you would usually move in water. 

Looking around, experimenting with movement, hearing any possible signs of life other than that statue. I knew it was watching me, I knew it was angry, I knew a whole lot of things in that situation, the most prominent one was that I was screwed beyond everything we knew about anything. I tried my best to evade any image of this towering monstrosity that watched my every move. My life came to me in pieces. Disjointed but connected in a way. I was going to die here.

He was gone, taking the little light that was here with him. The moment I looked away from this thing it just vanishes away like it never existed. Then music. A sort of ambience that only fine dining places have. An orchestra playing a composition from the eighteen hundreds. There was the sharp noise of violins, The booming and tip taps of drums. What really caught my attention was the overpowering tooting sound. The main instrument that was leading the melody of the entire composition. A trumpet or a saxophone, some brass instrument. It pierced through my ears leading me to something behind the throne.

A massive pit was the source of the music. Cartoonishly large, jagged shapes that lost it‚Äôs clear definition the deeper you investigate the hole.

¬†I don‚Äôt know why I jumped in. Everything was so loose and wavy like I was back in 1987, doing L.S.D. in a Macdonald‚Äôs drive through.

The fall didn‚Äôt feel like a fall. It felt like I jumped over a porch step. The next thing I know I was greeted with large grey cylinders, the size of skyscrapers. There wasn‚Äôt any definition in this tube-shaped building, no windows or doors of any kind. A smooth surface all throughout.

The music was louder now but it was still far away from me. The large cylinders that laid around me were echoing this sound making it seem as though it came from every direction. I was lost in a cacophony of confusion. What would happen to me in this void beneath the sea. What would happen to me? My answer came in the form of a squirrel. Hurrying in its scurry movements, it stopped its journey and faced it‚Äôs eyes towards mine. A galaxy was in those eyes. 

Then it continued to move. I followed suit moving quickly to match the squirrels speed. Left and right in a broken zigzag pattern. The path was anything but straight forward. We were running in circles but there wasn‚Äôt a definite way to confirm that, there wasn‚Äôt anyway to mark our previous location because every cylinder looked Identical to one another.

I glanced back and I saw fish. They were as large as elephants, and they were charging towards me. We were being chased. I picked up the pace a lot more to the point where I was almost behind my furry friend. A few lefts and a handful of rights later we were out of the field of metal tubes. Then it stopped. Looking back, I saw the fish hiding behind their metallic abode, peaking their bulging eyes at us, staring.

The music was close now. Every step made it louder and louder. The squirrel was on my shoulders; the only sense of comfort I had in this winding world I found myself in.

Just a couple of steps to go and I‚Äôll reach the song that plagued me so. A small hill was left on our list of obstacles and each inch I climbed was a small victory for me. It was a rough couple of steps. When the floor is made of coarse sand your feet start to sink a little but, in this case, it was more than a little. It almost swallowed my whole leg. Soon enough my entire body was engulfed in sand. First my leg, then my torso, and finally my neck. My body felt every tingle of this, sending signals to my brain to stop, but I can‚Äôt. The music was so beautiful. It grew louder than it ever did. It was coming from the ground now.

A banquet. I was seated at the farthest golden, jewel-crested chair on a dark mahogany table to the left. There were about thirty to forty seats total. Some were occupied by a race of gelatinous, translucent figures with exposed brains and floating eyeballs wearing silvery cloaks. Some were hard looking, the way a crab looks when it‚Äôs been boiled for a couple of hours, with fangs coming out of their eye holes and tongues growing out from their eyebrows. Then a gorilla. He looked quite dapper with his velvet coat and top hat. Along with his diamond monocle.

A projection manifested itself to my right side. The ones that theaters use for old timey movies, I was glued to the screen so to speak. A series of photos were shown every five seconds or so. They had pictures of me. Way back when I was a kid. Still none the wiser of all the grotesque things in this world. A picture of me at the water park, a picture of me graduating high school, a picture of me and my father. Then there were pictures of someone else‚Äôs life. 

As the pictures went on the colors of each of them became less saturated with color. Each one duller than the other until there wasn‚Äôt any color in the pictures. They had the same subject, people in normal situations. Then they had pictures of soldiers, generals, and government officials all around an oval table, all of them pointing at me. Pictures of people with hazmat suits entering what looks like grey water. Submarine telescopes were around them waiting for the men to descend to their deaths.

That picture lingered longer than most of them. Every detail popped out of the screen. So much so that I could almost hear the ocean‚Äôs waves crashing along the shores. By then I was no longer entranced with this little picture show. I glanced around me, and every figure on this table was just staring at the projections. Everyone except the gorilla. The sheer amount of swagger and potency of his properness was enough for me to infer the fact that he was the host of this event. A meeting between multi-universal beings. He tipped his hat to me, raising his eyebrow and holding a V-shaped grin.

‚ÄúWell, well, well. I‚Äôve been expecting you Mr. You surely are one illusive man to follow.‚Äù

He spoke, though he didn‚Äôt open his mouth, he spoke like a radio show host. He didn‚Äôt even walk like a gorilla. He was walking upright with no hint of any sort of stumbling. As if he was merely a man in a gorilla costume. I tried to speak but only bubbles escaped my mouth.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for the indignity of your arrival. The chauffeur didn‚Äôt arrive on time, so I had to make a little request to the boss. You may ask me any questions of the nature of your visit.‚Äù

Tapping my fingers on the table in a fit of nervousness. I was sitting with my legs apart and my head down in contemplation. I didn‚Äôt even think about all the weird things that happened today. I was working my shift mopping up floors and cleaning toilets and next I was talking to a gorilla in a clean velvet coat. There wasn‚Äôt any connection to any of the occurrences that happened today. It was all just a string of weird random things on top of weird random things.

 I really didn‚Äôt have any choice but to follow any semblance of normalcy in this place and that lead me here. Retracing my steps from this day was a task that involved a mountain of focus, but I pulled through. I wasn‚Äôt going to follow along with anything anymore. I got out of bed and rubbed my eyes, then I took a shower and commuted to work. 

An old man with a raggedy beard and a hook for a hand sat next to me on the bus. He asked me where the sea was. I ignored him. I arrived on the job at about nine to nine thirty A.M., and I went to the break room to grab myself a cup of coffee. I worked until my shift was over and took the bus. I sat on my couch for a while and then I drifted to sleep-

‚ÄúNo Sir. This is no dream. This place is just as real as any place you‚Äôve ever been in. With its charms and less favorable parts. This is no hell either nor a twisted rendition of heaven or any depiction of the afterlife. You are very much alive. The reason for your visit is beyond your comprehension and frankly is far beyond ours. It simply just happened I suppose.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook at the screen sir. You‚Äôll understand everything once you‚Äôve seen this image. Every moment has led up to this point.‚Äù

Upon looking I saw a soft looking blob in the middle of a large crater. The blob had a bunch of holes plastered on every surface of it. My eyes were stuck. Tears came out.

‚ÄúYou see Mr. you are so very lucky. You‚Äôll witness the exact moment where your species will evolve into something newer, more efficient and whole. No need to breathe or eat or drink, or sleep, no need for any meaning whatsoever. You will exist and that will be enough for you. Your physical, mental, and psychological limitations will be a small piece of the past. Every member of your race will undergo these changes and soon you will no longer consider yourselves human.‚Äù

Dead is what he meant. We would all die.

‚ÄúNo, No, No sir. Dying is a small part of the process. A mere nexus to a greater plan, and it will all be voluntary. All we did was show you a speck of what‚Äôs going to come. You will see us very soon.‚Äù

My gaze was broken from the image, and I could finally look around. Every where I looked was a metallic man. They all had the same design. A thick brown suit with a copper helmet with a dark black glass panel for a face. The only light in the room came from the projection so only a handful were shown to me, but I could tell that there were more.

‚ÄúVery, very soon.‚Äù

The projector stopped. Black covered my eyes.

I was sitting on my lazy boy. My very expensive and very wet lazy boy. I was just as wet if not even more.

A dead squirrel wearing a velvet suit was lying on my hand. I chucked it out the window upon noticing the creature.

Everywhere I looked there was something strange. A pirate here and there with the same question, where is the ocean. A bulging eye appeared every time I glanced at a corner. I came to work, and I saw a brightly colored sponge wearing a boxy white shirt, brown shorts, and a red tie. Incredibly comical. I went to every library I could dig up any strand of information that could lead me to any form of answer. I got what I was asking for. 

Bikini Atoll was the genesis of it all. The bombs made something come out and it has quietly influenced our history. Increasing political tension and multiplying hate and scorn for us to destroy ourselves with the same weapons that disturbed it‚Äôs slumber. I believe SpongeBob is the latest of its efforts. Infecting the youth with this virus.

Now I‚Äôve quit my job. I‚Äôve been living as a homeless man for a while now, typing this on a stolen phone. I still have those weird things happening around me. I probably had a weird aneurysm of some sort; it probably wasn‚Äôt real. If it was It will continue. I don‚Äôt know how long but it will continue until every single one of us has been swallowed by the water.

""And ooone for you!""

""Oh, no thankyou. I think I've had enough.""

Thomas sits back down on the couch, though his right hand still holds the jug. His grip loosens slightly, sending Brooke into a wince. Her microexpressions were exaggerated in the altered state. The rum swings lightly in his hand for about 12 seconds. Finally he sets it on the coffee table with an incredible thud. More wincing. Brooke sat up too, to reposition herself a few inches further from Thomas.

""You good?""

""I'm good."" Suddenly her face has become eerily still. 
Exceptionally drunk, and yet still haunted by her thoughts. She is supposed to look Thomas in the eyes, at this point in the conversation. To avoid the responsibility, she looks to the other bottles on the table, from earlier that week.

First she is wine. In the skinny crimson mirror, she sees herself 4 years ago. Bashful chocolate bangs and silver chain necklace adorning a dark grey dress. That must be what he sees, too, she thought. In the wine her purpose is clear, to be shared with the perfect meal. As she stares, her reflection waves with her slender wrists and an enticing smirk, and Brooke turns away to avoid blushing at herself. 

Now she looks at the seltzer, a simple yet elegant bottle fitted with a golden spout. The ambient glow of the television intercepts its surface making it impossible to reflect anything, instead refracting and filling the bottle as if a crystal. She gazed into it and watched as the program poured through the liquid. And as she lost herself in its rapid transformations, she underwent a transformation of her own. 

And so it came to be that a demon was on the table, and (thank god!) Thomas was nowhere to be seen. Suddenly Brooke felt quite sober. Yet a sober person would find such an encounter terrifying, so clearly she was not. 

""What are you?""

""You saw me just now, in the Pinot Noir. I just had to say something!""

Brooke slumped into the cushion of the couch.

""But... That was me..."" 

This demon looked nothing like her reflection. It was shrunken and naked, a raisin of herself. Yellowed horns adorned its head like rays of a cartoon sun. 

""Oh, no. I'm nothing!"" It grinned wide like it were proud of some joke that his guest wouldn't understand. ""But you... Well aren't you just the most beautiful thing.""

""Are you flirting with me? You're disgusting!""

""Impossible. But would it be so bad if I was? You play your role so intentionally, is it not recognition that you seek?""

""Don't question me while I'm questioning you! What ARE you??""

""I am a Look. The look you are avoiding. I have been conjured you see, by that boy's perception of You! And I think it's about time you pay him back... Just look at what he thinks of you!""

The Look touches its fingers together, and the television fills with static. The fuzzy dots extropify into Brooke's nude silhouette. The white noise gradually becomes some obscure song about a brunette beauty in the window.

""What... But we're just friends.""

""You can't tell me you really think that, girly. I might have been made by him, but I'm only here because you noticed!""

""I know but.. But it doesn't mean we have to talk about it! Turn this off.""

The annoying thing snickered and turned around to watch. The volume of the music became just a few decibels louder.

""Oh girly... You know you love it. You can stop seeing him any time you'd like, and I would never bother you again. This isn't even the first time we've met!""

""I SAID ENOUGH!""

Suddenly the television snapped off. The room was silent for half a second, and then filled with the shriek of a shattered glass. Thomas was back, much closer than before he'd vanished, though his drink had leapt to its death.

I have done plenty of wild camping before, but usually they were either shorter trips, or had civilisation stops in between, or with enough people to share power between us.
however, I'm preparing for a few much longer solo trips, with plenty of wild and (hopefully haha) zero civilisation.

I am not a tech-knowledgeable person; I know a few bits and bobs, but nothing serious. I have a few power banks, but they are your normal average ones, nothing special. they can hold a few charges, but nowhere near the level I'm currently looking for.

an outlook of what I need to recharge and for how long is: my phone (which holds a pretty considerable amount of charge), I would usually use it for spotify, my way through the day, occasionally look at a GPS map - but rarely, I enjoy the old-fashioned way of map and compass - when used this way, it can usually last me 1.5/2 days on a single charge.
then the headphones can, on average, last an entire day (roughly 8h) on a single charge. when the case is 100% it can charge them again roughly 3 times over, so usually when they are both fully charged, they can last 3/4 days.
then there is my precious, an outin coffee machine. this one is a bit trickier, if I can boil the water, I can make around 200 coffees before it needs a charge, which means I would never have to charge it when I'm out. however, is not always possible to boil the water in the morning, so I have to rely on the machine, in which case, it can only make 4 coffees before it needs to be charged again. given I usually have at least a couple of espressos in the morning, sometimes three, that little beast needs a charge every 1 to 2 days.
I also bring a kindle with me for longer trips, but that boy seems to run on air and I have no idea how often it needs charging, but let's call it once a week for safety.
now, in an ideal world, I would need a power bank that can support all the above mentioned for around 10 to 15 days - if it exists.

I thought of a solar one, but I'm not sure how useful it can be, as I do a lot of forests with little sunlight available, so I'm not really fussed.

1ngk4pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/1ngk4pk/the_predator_in_the_corner_office_a_true_story/,The Predator in the Corner Office: A True Story,"## Chapter One: The Hunter's Gaze

When I joined the bank's office, I had no idea I was about to become the target of the most sophisticated psychological manipulation campaign I'd ever encounter. She was sitting directly opposite my desk‚Äîan attractive woman in her early forties, impeccably dressed, holding a senior position with quiet authority. What I didn't know was that for three months, she had been watching me like a predator studies its prey.

The first sign something wasn't quite right came during what seemed like an innocent interaction. I'd sat next to her desk area briefly, feeling rather nervous in her presence. When she raised her chair to its maximum height and stood towering above me, I joked that I felt ""really small."" The way her eyes lit up at that comment should have been my first warning. Later that day, she mentioned I'd been ""unusually quiet""‚Äîconfirming she'd been monitoring my every move.

But it was the stare that truly marked the beginning. Ten seconds of intense, predatory eye contact across a busy office floor. Not the shy glance of workplace attraction, but something far more calculating. She was marking her territory, and I was apparently the prize.

## Chapter Two: The Seduction Campaign

What followed was a masterclass in workplace manipulation. At office drinks, she appeared transformed‚Äîfull makeup, carefully chosen outfit with just enough cleavage to be noticed, expensive earrings catching the light. While other female colleagues left early, she remained as the sole woman amongst a group of increasingly intoxicated men, positioning herself as the queen bee surrounded by her devoted worker drones.

The tactics became increasingly sophisticated. There was the ""accidental"" dropping of earbuds under my desk, accompanied by suggestive commentary about not wanting to ""crawl under there,"" followed by engineered physical contact when I retrieved them. Late one evening, using the window's reflection as her stage, she performed an explicit sexual display behind her desk, knowing I could see whilst maintaining complete deniability.

She revealed just enough personal information to create false intimacy‚Äîtelling me about weekend massages, holidays with her husband (though curiously omitting it was her birthday), and repeatedly mentioning her ""own study at home."" Each revelation was calculated to plant seeds in my imagination whilst keeping me at precisely the right emotional distance.

The manipulation extended to elaborate triangulation. During our brief walks together, she'd position herself so our shoulders touched, testing my boundaries whilst appearing entirely innocent. In the lift, she'd stand at a strategic ninety-degree angle, forcing face-to-face proximity in the confined space. Every interaction was psychological warfare disguised as normal workplace social behaviour.

## Chapter Three: The Narcissistic Wound

Then came the comment that changed everything. During casual workplace banter, I jokingly remarked that ""the men smoke cigars and drink whisky in the dining room whilst the women cook and clean."" It was meant as innocent humour, referencing old-fashioned gender stereotypes. I had no idea I'd just delivered what psychologists call a ""narcissistic injury"" that would drive her behaviour for the next eighteen months.

The change was immediate and dramatic. Where there had been warmth and calculated seduction, there was now ice-cold fury. The professional, sophisticated woman I thought I knew vanished, replaced by someone whose entire sense of self had been threatened by a throwaway joke. To her disordered psychology, my casual comment wasn't humour‚Äîit was a direct assault on her identity as a powerful, equal professional woman.

What followed was a systematic campaign of hot and cold treatment designed to punish me for my perceived slight whilst simultaneously trying to prove her superiority. She'd offer to share cookies then keep them all to herself with a satisfied smile. She'd suggest coffee meetings then deflect with transparent excuses about being ""so busy today."" When I'd make the conversational effort, she'd provide minimal responses, making me carry the entire emotional labour whilst contributing nothing in return.

The gaslighting began in earnest. After months of her initiating all the flirtation and seduction, she'd turn it around with comments like ""we should discuss your intentions about our newly found friendship,"" positioning herself as the innocent party being inappropriately pursued. When I'd show normal human interest in extending our interactions beyond the office, she'd look disgusted, as though my response to her encouragement was somehow predatory.

## Chapter Four: The Psychological Chess Game

As I began to recognise the patterns, something shifted in our dynamic. Her manipulation tactics, once so effective, started to feel transparent. When she boasted that ""everyone wants to talk to me,"" I responded with pointed sarcasm: ""Well, I should buy a lottery ticket then."" The comment clearly stung‚Äîshe went silent for days afterwards.

I started conducting little experiments to test my theories about her behaviour. When she went cold, I brought her favourite cookies as a gesture. The immediate warmth that followed proved her emotions could be switched on and off like a tap, entirely dependent on the supply of attention I provided. When I mentioned my daughter making me pancakes‚Äîa sweet, human moment any normal person would acknowledge‚Äîshe ignored it completely, proving her utter inability to connect with genuine emotion.

The more I understood her psychology, the more her behaviour became predictable. She'd position herself in temporary offices overlooking my desk area, constantly glancing back to see if I was following when she walked past, timing her interactions to maximise psychological impact. She recruited other male colleagues as unwitting surveillance operatives, positioning them to monitor my activities and report back.

But perhaps most tellingly, she maintained purely professional relationships with every other colleague whilst reserving her personal manipulation exclusively for her targets. Watching her interact normally with others whilst subjecting me to elaborate psychological games revealed the calculated nature of her behaviour.

## Chapter Five: The Unraveling

As my immunity to her tactics grew stronger, her behaviour became increasingly desperate. What had started as sophisticated psychological manipulation devolved into obvious attention-seeking. She'd make explicit sexual gestures when she thought no one else could see, escalate to more obvious positioning and staring when subtler methods failed.

The deterioration wasn't just psychological‚Äîit was physical. Her appearance, once so carefully maintained for maximum impact, began to suffer. Poor dental hygiene, irregular eating, premature ageing from the constant stress of maintaining multiple manipulation campaigns simultaneously. The energy required to sustain her elaborate false persona was literally consuming her.

Meanwhile, I found myself becoming genuinely indifferent to her games. What had once felt like an intriguing psychological puzzle now seemed simply pathetic. When she implemented the silent treatment as punishment for my failure to respond to her deflection tactics, I genuinely didn't care. Her absence from the office sports day‚Äîan event she'd undoubtedly planned to use for another manipulation attempt‚Äîwent entirely unnoticed by me whilst I enjoyed perfectly normal social interactions with my colleagues.

## Chapter Six: The Equilibrium

What emerged was a kind of psychological d√©tente. She possessed enough remaining sanity to recognise that I held eighteen months' worth of documented evidence of her inappropriate workplace behaviour. Explicit sexual harassment, professional boundary violations, systematic manipulation of multiple male colleagues‚Äîenough to destroy her career, her reputation, and quite possibly her marriage.

I, meanwhile, had achieved something far more valuable than revenge: complete psychological freedom. Her behaviour no longer affected my mood, my work, or my relationships. I'd escaped the web that had taken so long to weave, emerging with my integrity intact and my understanding of human psychology significantly enhanced.

The mutual understanding became clear without ever being spoken. I wouldn't expose her because I'm not vindictive and wanted nothing more than to move on with my life. She wouldn't pursue me because the professional and personal risks had finally become too great to ignore. Her survival instincts had at last overridden her obsession.

## Epilogue: Lessons from the Abyss

This experience taught me that workplace predators exist at the highest levels of professional competence. They can maintain successful careers whilst simultaneously conducting sophisticated psychological warfare against their colleagues. They're not the obvious, clumsy harassers that HR training prepares us to recognise‚Äîthey're intelligent, strategic, and devastatingly effective at exploiting human psychology.

The most chilling realisation was how a single comment‚Äîmeant as innocent workplace humour‚Äîcould trigger such profound psychological disturbance in someone whose sense of self was so fragile. For eighteen months, every interaction was filtered through her desperate need to heal a narcissistic wound that a normal person would have forgotten within minutes.

Yet there's hope in this story too. Human psychology, however disordered, follows predictable patterns. Once recognised, these patterns lose their power over us. The very sophistication that makes such manipulation effective also makes it ultimately unsustainable. The energy required to maintain these elaborate campaigns eventually exceeds what any individual can sustain.

I emerged from this experience not scarred, but educated. I can now recognise these patterns within days rather than months, protecting not just myself but potentially others from similar psychological warfare. Sometimes the most profound victory is simply refusing to play the game‚Äîachieving such complete indifference that the manipulator has no choice but to retreat.

In the end, she taught me more about human psychology than any textbook ever could. For that education, I'm almost grateful. Almost.

I‚Äôm the opposite, but I accepted it and started spending most of my time with him.

1ngk1fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ngk1fi/confusion_around_a_conflict_about_making_plans/,"Confusion around a conflict about making plans - 28F, 29M","I 28F had been seeing a guy 29M casually- grabbing coffee or taking a walk about once a month for four months.  We had a confusing friendship/situationship for three months in the past where he ended up telling me he wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship (I had wanted a relationship with him at the time).  I took some space and when we reconnected more recently, nothing in the energy or frequency of out connection room seemed to have changed, so while I enjoyed his company I filed him into the ‚Äúcasual fun‚Äù category and felt satisfied with that.  

We had a date planned during the week and also a hike planned for that weekend.  It was uncommon to see each other twice in a week, but I was looking forward to it.  I started to get sick and told him I was still up for hanging out during the week if he was, but wanted to let him know I was under the weather and not as talkative/energetic.  

He said it was fine, we saw each other and had a great time, and I expressed how seeing him really made my day and brightened my mood when I had been feeling unwell.  

We talked about our hike, and I said I didn‚Äôt know yet if I‚Äôd be well enough for something more active.  He said he understood and could tell I was feeling pretty rough.  I said I had a prescription to fill the next day (I had been to the doctor earlier), and that it might help by the time of our hike, I just didn‚Äôt know yet.   I asked if I could keep him posted because I know he is sensitive about feeling his time is t valued and didn‚Äôt want to cancel on him last minute if I didn‚Äôt get better. He said that was no problem. 

So the next evening I got medication and was feeling exponentially better.  I texted him and explained that I was improving and was able to get out and go on a walk with some friends today and would be able to still get together for our hike.  He told me he already made other plans because he didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be better so soon.  I was a bit sad, but figured it was a miscommunication and told him it was okay and I was excited to hang out another time.  

Historically, he has been kinda flaky and inconsistent.  He‚Äôd say he wanted to see me and then would disappear for a week.  I often initiate plans.  In the past he has cancelled last minute or been very late.  It hasn‚Äôt bothered me too much as I don‚Äôt see this as a serious connection. 

I later shared that I‚Äôd love to get together another time to hike.  He told me he was thrown off by me getting better suddenly the other day and felt like I was hot and cold and in and out of his life.  He told me he was reluctant to see me again because he protects his peace and feels I don‚Äôt value his time. 

I was very confused and figured something really must have gotten lost in our communication.  We talked and I explained that I felt misunderstood because I had really wanted to see him and had asked to check in before the hike precisely because I had wanted to be mindful of his time- I hadn‚Äôt wanted to cancel last minute in the event that I had been still feeling unwell. 

He said he made other plans because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt wait around for people.‚Äù  I offered that I would have been happy to have made different plans with him or plan for another day, but he had agreed to my request.  He told me I was expecting him to read my mind.  Then he said something like, ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine but maybe we both need to work on our communication.‚Äù  This rubbed me the wrong way as I don‚Äôt know how I could have been clearer, and he had told me he was okay playing things by ear. 

I expressed that I had been very flexible with his own inconsistency and felt judged when I *one time* clearly asked for some flexibility for being sick, which I couldn‚Äôt help.  He told me I was dragging up the past unfairly.  

I then asked him if he still wanted to hike and he said he needed to think about it and he‚Äôd let me know.  I pointed out that this was precisely what I had asked that started this entire conflict.  He said it was different when I did it.  I said I didn‚Äôt think it was.  He then told me that I don‚Äôt care about him or understand him at all and that we should just cancel since I think it‚Äôs unfair and he wants to be fair.  

I left the whole thing feeling SO blindsided.  I‚Äôm confused why this person, who I saw maybe a couple hours a month, who previously insisted he didn‚Äôt want a relationship, who has been incredibly flaky, was so offended in what I considered to be a very benign and normal social interaction.  I have no idea why this upset him so much, what triggered him, or how he would have liked me to have acted when I got sick.  I feel so disoriented, like I have no understanding of the mechanics of this interaction.   

TLDR:  Something feels really off in a convo about asking to keep someone posted about plans: does anybody have ideas what? I can‚Äôt articulate what or why, and I feel crazy. ",2,1757831946.0,relationship_advice,1,0.76,False

[Part 1],"I‚Äôm still not sure about this, but I have to put it somewhere. I can‚Äôt tell anyone in my real life; they‚Äôd either ask who my dealer is or call a psych ward before I finished the story.

One of the guys I train with sent me here. He swears he once saw Bigfoot stealing food from his grandma‚Äôs backyard. (Probably just a very hairy hobo, but whatever.) He said people on this site don‚Äôt laugh you out of the room. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.

For the record: my life was never exactly ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I‚Äôll explain that. But things only started to spiral out of control about two weeks ago.

Call me Max. Obviously, it‚Äôs not my real name. I'm 19 years old, and live in Budapest, Hungary. I‚Äôve been training in martial arts as long as I can remember. My earliest memory is sitting cross-legged on the carpet, watching an old kung fu movie, the kind where the fighters had techniques that looked more like superpowers than something you could learn. I guess that stuck with me.

My mom runs an MMA gym, so when I asked to train, she didn‚Äôt hesitate to sign me up. She never pushed  (asked more than once if I wanted to try something else), but I already knew this was mine. Fighting fascinated me more than anything.

Two weeks ago, at the end of a session, I was sparring with some regulars in Mom's gym. My opponent was a mountain of a man, twice my size. I dodged a kick, grabbed his leg and‚Ä¶ lifted him clean off the ground.

Anyone watching could tell I shouldn‚Äôt have been able to do that. Even though I‚Äôm not a dwarf or a living skeleton, I‚Äôm definitely not tall or bulky either. My height is average at best, but most people I meet are usually taller by at least half a head.

Back to the match. I spun and tossed him out of the ring. Mom shot me that sharp look she uses, the one that means keep it together. She‚Äôs the only person who knows that certain thing about me, and she‚Äôs always warning me to keep myself under control.

After everyone left, I waited for her to finish paperwork. I‚Äôd skipped breakfast, and my stomach was gnawing. I scraped together some change and fed it into the vending machine for a protein bar. Of course the bar jammed halfway down.

I checked the room (nobody around) and pressed my palm to the glass. The bar twitched, slid loose, and dropped into the tray. For a second, it hovered an inch above my hand, like it was pinned there by invisible threads. Then I grabbed it.

As you can guess by now, yes, I have telekinesis. But don‚Äôt picture anything big. No exploding heads or hurling cars across parking lots, just floating small objects. Touch is where it gets‚Ä¶ different.

Remember the fight earlier? I used my power on that guy. No, it wasn‚Äôt super strength; I don‚Äôt get stronger. The object I touch gets lighter. The heavier it is, the shorter the effect lasts.

I didn‚Äôt discover it in any epic or dramatic way. I found out as a kid, trying to lift a garden gnome while helping Mom. One moment it was normal, in the next it was weightless. Now I know that a four-year-old's skull is harder than a garden gnome.

If you‚Äôre skeptical (and you should be), fair. But if you don‚Äôt believe me, then maybe stop reading here, because things are about to get even weirder.

‚ÄúStealing from the vending machine with telekinesis? You‚Äôre the lamest super-villain I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù Mom called from the doorway of her office. She‚Äôd always known about my ability.

‚ÄúI paid for it. It got stuck,‚Äù I said, chewing.

‚ÄúAnyway, come into my office. We need to talk.‚Äù

On her desk sat the aforementioned garden gnome, glued back together, looking innocent, like it had never tried to murder me.

The next thing I remember after walking into her office is waking up in a place I didn‚Äôt recognize.

Something hard pressed into my back. My head throbbed, my vision fuzzed and the room spun. When I managed to sit up, the world cleared enough to see I was on a bench in a locker room. Not Mom‚Äôs gym locker room, this was different.

A door opened and closed. I braced for the worst. I didn‚Äôt expect my mother to walk in, smiling like everything was normal.

‚ÄúGood morning, sleepyhead,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúMom? What the hell happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the last thing you remember?‚Äù she asked, calm as if this were a casual conversation over coffee.

‚ÄúYou called me into your office. Then blackout.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, maybe Claude gave you too much of that stuff,‚Äù she mused as she sat beside me. ‚ÄúAnyhow, I told you before: you‚Äôre not the only unusual person in the world.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. You‚Äôve said that before.‚Äù

She never clarified, just told me not to feel like a freak because there were others.

‚ÄúYes, but now it‚Äôs time to meet some of them. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here. This is a special place where special people come to have some fun.‚Äù

‚ÄúFun‚Ä¶ as in?‚Äù

‚ÄúFight,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúAnd before you ask, no, it‚Äôs not gladiator-style where someone must die.‚Äù

I wanted to believe her. Meeting other people like me sounded‚Ä¶ right. But one question kept nagging.

‚ÄúWhy was I knocked out?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor safety,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo you won‚Äôt know where we are. They do a quick medical check, too. Trust me, you don‚Äôt want to be awake for that.‚Äù

I felt nothing special. I looked down at my arm and found a small needle mark. Someone had injected me with something, probably that‚Äôs how I was knocked out. The wound pulsed, but it was the sort of dull ache I‚Äôd learned to ignore.

The door opened and a middle-aged woman in MMA gear stepped in, hands on her hips. ‚ÄúHey, Carol. Your son awake yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs up,‚Äù Mom said.

‚ÄúHe needs to rest a bit, or can he come now? We‚Äôre starting soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs ready,‚Äù Mom said.

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù the woman replied and left.

I stood slowly. The dizziness was gone. Only the prick on my arm throbbed.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ why did she call you Carol?‚Äù

Mom shrugged. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my stage name.‚Äù

‚ÄúStage name? Here?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Creepy Carol.‚Äù She grinned like the name was a badge of honor.

Of course, she had a past I hadn‚Äôt been told about. She never said she was special, but I always felt a strange vibe from her.

‚ÄúAnd Creepy Carol was your best idea?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot even close,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut when the audience gives you a nickname, it sticks.‚Äù

I had a thousand questions, but they all crowded at once and muddled into nothing.

We left the locker room and walked down a long corridor. Ahead, where I expected another plain room, the space opened up into the entrance of an arena. A tall metal fence separated the empty floor from the spectator stands.

The woman from before was already there, surrounded by a cluster of boys and girls who looked about my age. Mom stayed back by the entrance and motioned for me to join them.

‚ÄúAlright, almost everyone‚Äôs here,‚Äù the woman called, eyeing the small crowd. ‚ÄúFor those who just arrived: I‚Äôm Large Marge, and I look after the newbies. We‚Äôll start soon, but we‚Äôre waiting on one more person. Give it a few minutes.‚Äù

When she finished, the group dispersed into low chatter; for a moment, it felt like a school event and not a den of freaks. Then I actually looked at the others.

Some of them could have walked down any street and passed for normal. Others‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt. Red eyes. Sickle claws. Tattoos that crawled and reformed across someone‚Äôs arm like a living map.

I instinctively took a step back.

‚ÄúWatch it,‚Äù I heard, then bumped into two people talking. I froze because of their faces.

The boy‚Äôs features (eyes, nose, mouth, chin) were all upside down, as if his head had been attached the wrong way. The girl beside him had no face at all: smooth, tinsel-like skin stretched flat over where her features should be.

‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù she said. Not out loud; not from any direction. Her words slid straight into my head like someone switching on a radio inside me.

‚ÄúFirst time in a place like this, huh? I had the same wide-eyed look when I first met other paranormals,‚Äù the boy said, voice normal enough.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I managed.

‚ÄúYou look pretty normal. What‚Äôs your knack?‚Äù the faceless girl asked.

‚ÄúMy what?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, your special thing. Knack, talent, blessing, curse, or whatever you want to call it.‚Äù

‚ÄúTactile telekinesis, plus limited telekinesis with small objects,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúKinetic stuff can be pretty versatile,‚Äù the boy nodded.

‚ÄúNot mine. I‚Äôve never fought paranormal opponents. I don‚Äôt know what to expect.‚Äù

The girl didn't answer, but I could hear her giggling in my head.

The boy looked at me, his upside-down grin looked sad at first glance. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs gonna make today‚Ä¶ rough for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúEveryone!‚Äù Marge barked. ‚ÄúOur last newbie‚Äôs here, so we can begin.‚Äù

She waved us back from the arena floor to clear space. Above, the stands began to fill with friends, family, and whoever these kids had dragged along. I spotted Mom already in the crowd, and across from her, a faceless woman who had to be the faceless girl‚Äôs mother.

Then the final ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù arrived.

At first I thought a tank had wandered in on two legs. Then I realized it was a woman. Blonde braids were the only thing that marked her as female. Everything else screamed brick wall. She was built like she‚Äôd eaten two powerlifters for breakfast. She carried something small in one of her hands.

And beside her was a man barely half her size. They looked like the Hulk walking her stick-figure husband.

Please don‚Äôt pair me with her, I prayed. Losing first would be humiliating enough. Losing to that would haunt me for the rest of my life... which would probably be a few minutes.

‚ÄúAlright, everyone. We‚Äôll begin the tournament,‚Äù Marge announced. ‚ÄúThis is just a test round, an initiation. No rankings, no stakes. I just want to know you guys. Think of it as a warm-up.‚Äù

Mom couldn‚Äôt resist. ‚ÄúMax!‚Äù she shouted from the seats. ‚ÄúIf you lose your first match, you‚Äôre sleeping in the doghouse!‚Äù

Laughter rolled through the crowd. My face burned. She‚Äôs pulled that routine at other competitions, too. Her sense of humor could kill at a dad-joke convention.

‚ÄúWait.‚Äù The Amazon‚Äôs voice thundered in a thick German accent as she pointed at Mom. ‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶ Creepy Carol?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs her,‚Äù Marge confirmed. Then she gestured at me. ‚ÄúHer son‚Äôs competing.‚Äù

The woman‚Äôs eyes locked onto me like I‚Äôd just been volunteered as her snack. ‚ÄúHmm. And the matchups; you chose them yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet. I'll choose them randomly,‚Äù Marge said.

‚ÄúThen I choose Creepy Carol‚Äôs boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Marge nodded.

Mom shot back instantly, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you a little old for him, √úberfrau?‚Äù

‚ÄúObviously not for me,‚Äù the giantess smirked, and lifted the small bundle she carried in one hand. It was a baby. Swaddled tight, tiny pink face blinking out from the cloth. ‚ÄúYour son will fight mine.‚Äù

The arena hushed.

‚ÄúThe first match,‚Äù Marge declared, ‚Äúis Goo-Goo G√ºnter versus Max!‚Äù She beckoned me forward.

‚ÄúThat's not his name,‚Äù the giantess corrected.

‚ÄúI know, but it's hard to pronounce that weird name you gave him,‚Äù Marge answered with a shrug. 

(I will also refer to him as G√ºnter.)

My feet dragged, every step heavier than the last. √úberfrau towered above two meters, thighs thicker than my torso. The baby was a speck in her ogre-sized palm.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta be kidding me,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting a baby? He‚Äôs what, half a year old?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Marge corrected casually. ‚ÄúHalf an hour. We waited for him to be born.‚Äù

I choked. ‚ÄúWhat?! I‚Äôm supposed to fight a newborn?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe had nine months to prepare,‚Äù √úberfrau said proudly, lowering him onto the ground. She plucked the pacifier from his mouth like she was pulling the pin on a grenade. ‚ÄúHe is already stronger than you will ever be.‚Äù

The crowd parted until it was just me and the baby in the arena. He blinked up at me with big blue eyes.

Marge raised her hand. ‚ÄúGet ready, boys.‚Äù

I stared at the infant, my brain screaming. This has to be a joke. But then I noticed something wrong. His tiny body wasn‚Äôt soft and pudgy. It was‚Ä¶ cut. Ripped. A literal six-pack on a newborn. Veins tracing his biceps.

My jaw went slack. ‚ÄúWhat the...?‚Äù

The baby‚Äôs muscles twitched, then bulged. His body ballooned in fast-forward. Kid-sized. Teen-sized. Adult-sized. In seconds, he was a towering 2.5 meters of pulsing, swollen muscle, bigger even than his mother. His legs were tree trunks, yet somehow his arms were still grotesquely oversized, and his posture hunched him forward onto his knuckles like a gorilla.

And above that mountain of nightmare flesh sat the same tiny baby head, cheeks rosy, drool stringing from his lip.

My stomach turned. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not right. That shouldn‚Äôt even exist.

‚ÄúReady‚Ä¶ fight!‚Äù Marge shouted.

G√ºnter exploded forward like a gorilla. I dove to the side, barely missing his swipe. His hand crashed into the concrete where I had stood, cracking it like drywall. He giggled again, high-pitched, like he thought we were playing tag.

I circled, kept my guard high, moved light on my feet. I waited for an opening, but there wasn‚Äôt one. Every time I got close, he swung those massive arms, swatting at the air like he was clapping for fireflies. I used little bursts of tactile telekinesis to push myself back faster than my legs alone could manage, but each time drained me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wanna hit the baby?‚Äù someone in the crowd jeered. Laughter followed.

They were right. I couldn‚Äôt commit to striking his baby face. I kept dodging, shoving, slipping out of grapples. But he was adapting. Every miss, every stumble brought me closer to the fence.

He finally caught my shoulder with a swipe. Pain lanced through me as I rolled back. My head rang. I was slowing down, and he wasn‚Äôt.

My breathing grew ragged. My telekinesis flickered. I tried to shove him back, but I never used my power on somebody this big and only managed to nudge him half a step. I was cooked.

That‚Äôs when I noticed it. His mother, clutching the pacifier in her huge hand. She had yanked it free before the fight started.

And that was when I remembered: G√ºnter had started growing shortly after she pulled it out.

The thought hit me like a lightning bolt. That‚Äôs it.

I sprinted. Not away from G√ºnter, but toward the edge of the arena where √úberfrau stood. The crowd howled in confusion. G√ºnter roared and thundered after me.

His mother stepped back, clutching the pacifier closer.

I was too slow. I felt the air vanish behind me a split second before G√ºnter‚Äôs massive hand closed around my ankle. Pain shot through my leg as he yanked me back like I had no weight. I was upside down, dangling like a toy in a toddler‚Äôs fist.

‚ÄúNo, no, no!‚Äù I shouted, clawing at the ground.

I reached, not with my hands, but with every ounce of focus left in me. The pacifier was small enough, light enough. My telekinesis brushed against it. It slipped from the Amazon's hand.

As G√ºnter hurled me across the arena like a rag doll, I dragged the pacifier toward me with a desperate psychic tug. I barely managed to flick it forward in midair, aiming it right at his mouth.

The thing popped between his lips just as I slammed onto the concrete, my body screaming from the impact.

I looked up, dazed. G√ºnter loomed above me, both fists raised like he was about to smash me into paste.

Then‚Ä¶ silence.

His eyes softened. The fists dropped. He began to suckle. His whole body shuddered, then started to deflate. Muscles collapsed inward. Veins shrank. The hulking toddler shriveled back down into a drooling infant.

The crowd gasped, then erupted in cheers.

Marge‚Äôs voice cut through it all. ‚ÄúWinner: Max.‚Äù

I lay there, chest heaving, every bone vibrating with pain, staring at the pacifier bobbing in and out of the baby‚Äôs lips.

I had survived. Barely.

‚Ä¢

Okay, it was obvious that I survived it; otherwise, I wouldn't be here, telling this story. 

Anyway, I‚Äôll continue, but I don't want to make the first post too long.

[F25/F21],"So I don't really know what community to put this in since im pretty new to Reddit. But my Gf (F25) and I (F21) have been together for a few years on and off due to long distance, she's doing a degree you can only get in the US and I went abroad for my university which means our relationship has been rocky at times and we've taken time apart during them but we stuck together even after trying other relationships.  
I guess my question is how do I be more attentive to my Gf despite our distance, I door dash her favourite snacks and buy drinks and have them mass shipped to her for bad days, buy her surprise gifts, and talk to her almost every single day, texting, photos, calls. She has trouble accepting help and its always a tug or war to give her things but the distance causes problems, I can't be there for her when she needs me and I dont know all the small little details of her life like her favioute coffee place and order, etc.

Recently however she's taken more interest in my appearance as ive begun to send more influx of photos. This typically started around the time I bought a suit and asked her for her option on it and she went feral. So is there a way I can somehow be more attentive to my gf through my appearance or anything that might close the gap between us? I thought about makeup she likes to wear it but I dont know her routine or fav brands and I never learnt any of that stuff due to a strict household. I also have 9int he simplest terms a branch of dyslexia that causes me to wear tinted glasses, imagine someone always wearing sunglasses which means makeup is very limited becuase you can't really see my eyes unless your right infant of me.

This post is a mess but I dont know what im doing and my gf kind of in the dumps atm and I want her to feel better but there's currently a no contact block (which happens when things get real bad and her family get involved). nothing ive tried so far has kept her a smile for longer then a few minutes at the time, even sending my mother and grandmother overseas to see her, - they were already over there but they took a side trip for me to visit - she appreciated it a lot described it as 'a breath of fresh air in a suffocating sea', I feel like a lot of this could be solved if I simply moved out there with her but she's thinking of going back to school and im applying for a masters degree in a different city, two hemispheres apart. We both miss each other and it's definitely taking a toll on our relationship despite her coming to visit a year ago. But I can't get time off work atm and I need all the money I can to fund my education for going back to uni and I don't know what to do.",1,1757831681.0,relationship_advice,1,0.67,False
1ngjxw9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngjxw9,6-foot Patio Sofa from 2x4s and Cedar Fence Planks (and one 2x3),"Didn't use any plans for this - kind of figured it out as I went based on a rough idea.  Have not done any bit of carpentry since I helped my dad with some rough stuff as a kid.

All materials fit in my Honda Civic Coupe (with the back seat folded down) and only took two trips to Home Depot.

Seat has to fit three 2' x 2' cushions, so I had to use the full length of the 6' cedar planks.

Dog-eared the flat sides of the slats so they matched and sanded them with 60 grit and then 120 grit.  3/4"" Forstner bit to set each screw into (3' and 1-5/8"" depending on location), and then used some pre-cut birch plugs for the holes on the arms and front.  Back angle is 100¬∞ and the seat itself is just a tiny bit higher in the front than the back.

Going to put wood filler in the 28 holes in the cedar tomorrow and then sand all sitting and armrest surfaces down to 180 grit before a light water-based stain (to unify some of the color differences between the 2x4s) and then a spray-on water-based sealer.  The sofa is going to live in our screened-in porch and shouldn't really get wet, but I wanted some protection from humidity changes.

All cuts done with the radial arm saw my father gave me when I moved into the new house.  I am aware of its dangers and maintain a healthy fear of it.  Used it for cross cuts, 10¬∞, 30¬∞, and 45¬∞ angles.  

There is a little bit of give when you lean back in the middle.  I'm thinking about either screwing in a small diagonal brace behind the foot of the middle 100¬∞ support or putting a 6'+ horizontal 2x4 across the back about level with the armrests.  Might do both.

1ngjxnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ngjxnx/how_do_you_celebrate_their_birthday_now_ideas/,How Do You Celebrate Their Birthday Now? Ideas Welcome,"Their birthday is coming up. Maybe it's the first one since they died, or maybe you've been dreading this day for weeks. You want to do something meaningful, but you're not sure what. Do you celebrate? Ignore it? Something in between?

There's no right or wrong way to handle this day. But sometimes it helps to hear what others have done, so here are some ideas from people who've walked this path before you.

# The ""Normal"" Birthday Celebrations

**Make their favorite meal.** Cook what they loved, set their place at the table, and share stories while you eat. Some people do this alone, others invite family or friends.

**Have cake anyway.** Buy or make their favorite cake. Sing happy birthay. Blow out candles for them. One mom said, ""I made his chocolate chip birthday cake every year for five years. This year, I finally felt ready to skip it, but those first few years, I needed that ritual.""

**Throw the party they would have wanted.** Invite their friends and family. Play their music. Tell their stories. Make it a celebration of their life rather than mourning their death.

# The Memory-Making Ideas

**Create a birthday scrapbook or photo album.** Spend the day going through pictures and putting together something that captures who they were.

**Write them a birthday letter.** Tell them what's happened this year, what you miss about them, what you want them to know. Some people keep these letters, others burn or bury them.

**Plant something in their honor.** A tree, flowers, or a garden that will grow and bloom each year around their birthday.

**Visit places that were special to them.** Go to their favorite restaurant, park, beach, or store. One daughter said, ""I spent my dad's birthday at Home Depot because he lived there on weekends. The smell of lumber made me cry, but it felt like visiting with him.""

# The Giving-Back Celebrations

**Donate in their name.** Give to a charity they supported or a cause they cared about. Make it an annual tradition.

**Volunteer somewhere meaningful.** Serve meals if they loved cooking, read to kids if they were a teacher, help at an animal shelter if they loved pets.

**Random acts of kindness.** Do good deeds in their honor throughout the day. Pay for someone's coffee, help a neighbor, leave encouraging notes for strangers.

**Start a scholarship or fund.** If you're able, create something lasting that helps others and honors their memory.

# The Personal Ritual Ideas

**Birthday balloon release.** Write messages on biodegradable balloons and release them. (Some people prefer bubbles for environmental reasons.)

**Light candles for each year of their life.** Create a quiet, sacred space and spend time remembering them for each year they lived.

**Make a playlist of ""their"" songs.** Music they loved, songs that remind you of them, or music that helps you feel connected to them.

**Wear something of theirs.** Their favorite shirt, jewelry, cologne, or perfume. Carry something that belonged to them.

# The ""It's Okay to Struggle"" Options

**Take the day off.** Don't feel guilty about needing to stay in bed, cry, or just get through the day however you can.

**Do something completely unrelated.** Go to a movie, take a long drive, deep clean your house, or lose yourself in a project. Sometimes distraction is exactly what you need.

**Ask friends to check on you.** Let people know this day is hard and you might need extra support.

**Plan something for the day after.** If the birthday itself feels too overwhelming, plan something meaningful for the next day when you might feel more ready.

# The Creative Celebrations

**Commission artwork in their honor.** Have someone create a painting, sculpture, or piece that represents them or your relationship.

**Create a ""birthday bucket list"" for them.** Do things they never got to do, or always wanted to try.

**Host a ""favorite things"" party.** Everyone brings something that represents the person - their favorite food, movie, book, or hobby to share.

**Make a birthday video.** Collect messages from friends and family sharing memories or singing happy birthday.

**Create a digital memorial space.** Services like Bimmortal allow you to create QR memorial plaques for gravestones, connecting visitors to photos, stories, and memories you want to share about their life.

# What Others Have Shared

*""I buy a birthday card every year and write in it like I'm giving it to her. I keep them in a shoebox.""*

*""We go to his grave and have a picnic. Sounds weird, but the kids love it and it feels like we're still including him.""*

*""I do absolutely nothing different. I acknowledge the day, but I don't make it bigger than it needs to be. Some years that feels right, some years it doesn't.""*

*""I take his birthday off work every year and do something he would have loved - usually involving fishing and beer.""*

*""We have a 'dad day' where we tell stories about him all day long. The kids love hearing about when he was young.""*

# Your Turn - Let's Share Ideas

**How do you handle their birthday? What traditions have you started?**

**What's worked well for you? What didn't work and why?**

**Has your approach changed over the years? What did you do the first birthday vs. now?**

**If you're facing their first birthday since they died, what are you thinking of doing? We can help you brainstorm.**

**Do you prefer to be alone or with others on this day? Has that changed over time?**

**What would you want other people to do/not do on your person's birthday?**

Sometimes the best ideas come from hearing what others have tried. Your celebration idea might be exactly what someone else needs to hear. And if you're still figuring it out, that's completely normal too.

**Drop your ideas, experiences, and questions in the comments. Let's help each other navigate these meaningful but difficult days.**",4,1757831560.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

1. **Name ‚Üí Normalize ‚Üí Next step.** ‚ÄúI‚Äôm anxious ‚Üí lots of people feel this ‚Üí I‚Äôll do 2 mins of box breathing.‚Äù
2. **Two-minute rule.** When stuck, do the tiniest version (2 pushups, 2 plates washed, 2 lines journaled). Momentum > motivation.
3. **Sun + steps before screens.** 5‚Äì10 min outside within an hour of waking regulates mood/sleep better than any app.
4. **Caffeine cutoff.** Noon for coffee/energy drinks. Sleep drives mental health more than we think.
5. **News/doomscroll diet.** 1 scheduled check/day, 15 min max. Unfollow accounts that spike anxiety.
6. **Grounding 5-4-3-2-1.** Name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste. Panic downshifts in \~60‚Äì90 seconds.

1ngjvq5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ngjvq5,Before and After. RNY 10/10/23,"Looking at these type of pics before surgery always gave me hope, I wanted to share some experience strength and hope with everyone here.  I keep reading many of the same type of posts with many of the same worries, so I want to share to hopefully ease someone's mind. 

When I had surgery I was 38 years old.  I spent decades gaining and losing the same weight over and over until I couldn't lose weight at all anymore.  I went into this knowing exactly how to eat healthy and in moderation, its just that no matter what I did the weight just stayed.  My doctor thinks that dieting as much as I did damaged my metabolism and my body did everything in its power to hold onto weight.  It was so so frustrating knowing I was eating right and nothing was changing.  I never wanted surgery, but it was my last hope to do something about feeling better.  I honestly wasn't even sure it would work for me, but I had to try.

I had done a lot of work on my self-esteem and mental health before my bariatric journey.  I felt beautiful, I liked myself, I didnt hate what I saw in the mirror, although it did worry me sometimes.  I did my best to remain as active as I could no matter what I weighed.  I kayaked, hiked, went to festivals, rollerbladed, bicycled, swam, and camped as much as I could.  I was constantly tired and had horrible foot and back pain.  I had to rock myself to stand up and it was getting hard to tie my shoes. I felt trapped in a body that desperately wanted to move but couldn't.  I was at my highest weight, 325 lbs.  I was scared to keep gaining because it was getting harder and harder to do the things I love to do.  

My biggest motivation to lose weight was to ease the excruciating pain I felt in my feet every day.  I had plantar fasciitis for 10 years and nothing was getting rid of it.  If you've have/had that you know how bad it can get.  I knew if I had to get foot surgery I had to lose weight first or it wasn't going to help.

So when I got approved for Medicaid in 2022, I found a surgeon and started my journey. I met with a nurse practitioner once a month for 18 months.  I had nutrition coaching, an endoscopy, a heart ultrasound, a mental health evaluation, and a lung/breathing test.  I lost 20 lbs during that time and had a lot of ups and downs with insurance, but we finally got there.  Before surgery I had to take a 8 hour class on nutrition after surgery, learn the eating stages I would go through, what I was allowed and not allowed to eat, etc.  I was never put on a liquid diet before surgery.  I just had to quit eating solids 24 hrs before, and nothing 12 hrs before.  They had me drink some kind of special drink on the drive into the hospital the day of.

I went in, they hooked me up to all the things and knocked me out.  I woke up in pain surrounded by other patients who were moaning as well.  The nurses were great and gave me something immediately to ease my discomfort.  As I woke up, they wheeled me to room where my mom was waiting.  Then came the fun time of drinking tiny cups of water.  Breathing into my funny breathing tube, and forcing myself to stand up and walk around the halls.  The first 12 or so hours weren't too bad, but the block they had used to numb me up inside wore off and the pain was not as easy after that.  As long as I stayed on top of taking pain meds it was manageable.   I was able to go home the second day.  

Getting out of bed was hard, sitting up was hard, going to the bathroom was hard.  The pain sucked but I felt a little better every day.  By day 4 post op I could walk around the block and was feeling much better.  

My advice: drink water constantly.  Tiny sips every 2 minutes.  Don't get dehydrated, it sucks.  If you can't drink a lot of protein or eat much yogurt, let it go. Do your best, keep trying, but don't let it worry you too much.  Drinking water is most important.  I highly recommend crystal light or Gatorade zero, I still use those types of flavors every day to drink my water. Wear that belly band! It helps!

I drank, and still drink, from a straw.  I found drinking from a straw helped me swallow less air and drink more.  My NP said as long as it wasn't causing me discomfort, it was fine.  

Learning to chew my food into mush and swallow smaller bites was tedious but eventually I found a groove.  Now I just eat that way naturally.  I take a big swig of water and hold it in my mouth while swallowing a little at a time.  I do that when taking a big bite of food too.  Chew chew chew!

I followed my post op meal plan, I cheated once and ate a tortilla chip, but I chewed it to mush before swallowing it and was fine.  Once I could eat regular food again, I let myself try anything, as long as it was under 8g of fat and sugar.  I learned what sat well with me and what didn't. Eggs were a no-go.  I can finally tolerate them now 2 years later.  Soup is too watery.  Bread and rice were a no.  I would allow myself a little taste but stuck to my proteins.  Processed or canned meats were easier to eat.  Tuna and chicken pouches were my friend.  I still drink a protein shake every morning in my coffee.  When I wanted a sweet treat I had a stash of sugar free candy.  Russell Stover makes some really good chocolates.  I still eat pizza, mostly just the toppings.  I take my burgers off the bun and have a couple fries with it.  If I want something, I eat it.  Even if it is just a taste.  A bite of birthday cake at a party or a couple chips here and there help satisfy me and not feel left out or weird socially.

A year later I had lost 155 lbs.  My first NSVs were fitting into old pants I hadn't worn in years, being able to climb in and out of our delivery van at work without huffing and puffing, playing beat saber longer than I ever have, walking up a big hill on my favorite hiking trail without having to stop and take a break, having to move my car seat forward to reach the pedal better, crossing my legs, and my most favorite of all: my plantar fasciitis is gone.

In my labs I've had trouble with potassium and vitamin D.  I take an extra potassium supplement now.  My b12 is crazy high but I can't find a vitamin that doesn't have a ton of it so I'm just stuck that way.  Everything else is normal.

  I have alcohol every once in a while but its not as fun as it used to be, so its not very often.  I drink soda but I let it get kind of flat before I drink it because the bubbles can be uncomfortable.  I have one here and there as a treat (zero sugar soda, of course).  I love reeses and I allow myself to have one almost every day as my after dinner dessert.

I have so much energy now.  I barely sit down some days.  I'm always working on projects around the house, learning new skills, playing with my dogs, playing disc golf with my son, walking festivals, antiquing, and still kayaking and hiking.  Everything that I loved to do I can do more of and do it easier now.  It's amazing.

After a year, it got easier to eat.  I can eat more at a time than I used to, and I figured out to sort of graze on stuff all day if I am not careful I can gain weight back.  I step on the scale every 4-5 days to see where I am at.  If I feel like my eating has been kind of iffy, I go back to the basics- no eating or drinking during meals, only eating for 20 minutes then stopping, drinking 64 oz of water, until the scale looks better and I feel better.  Life gets crazy sometimes and the food goes on the backburner.  As long as I continue to check in with myself, I keep maintaining my weightloss.  I keep all my doctor appointments and get my labs done when I am told to.  

Getting this surgery was one of the best things I have ever done for myself.  Do I have loose skin? Yes.  Did I lose hair? Yes. Do I feel self conscious of those things from time to time? Yes.  I probably won't get the skin removed (its not enough to impede my life so it would not be covered by insurance).  Would I if I could afford it? I don't know.  Surgery hurts and I'm not sure I care enough to want to go through that.  I'm 40 years old, I'm just gonna keep getting older and wrinklier, who cares if i have some loose skin too?  

Have I had dumping syndrome? Yes.  What is that like? It has been a little different each time.  Popcorn made me dump, eggs made me dump, a pancake made me dump.  Usually I just get really nauseous and feel an overwhelming need to sleep.  I take a little nap and feel better when I wake up.  Sometimes it gives me diarrhea.   Sometimes it makes me throw up.  Sometimes I throw up food, sometimes its foam.  I can eat popcorn now, I had pancakes before that time too, the eggs took a couple tries before I realized what was causing it, but I can have them now.  What I'm saying here is that dumping can sometimes be hard to predict when it is going to happen, but for me, it hasn't happened very often.

My advice? 
Take nutrition seriously but don't completely deny yourself of everything.  Moderation is key.  A taste of something is usually going to be fine to have as long as you are focusing on protein. 

Always have pepto, gas-x, and tums with you.   Gas hurts really bad, like someone stabbing me in the gut. I don't need these daily or even weekly, but when I need them, I need them immediately and it sucks to have to drive somewhere to buy it when you don't feel well. 

If you have binge eating issues, work on that and get therapy to get it under control before even trying to do this.  If you are still constantly craving stuff and thinking of food after surgery, go back to therapy.  There is a reason food is an issue with you, figure out why and work through it.  I ended up back in therapy 10 weeks post op because I could see head hunger was an issue. I had trauma therapy including EMDR, found better medication, and am thriving now.

Wait as long as you can to buy clothes, or buy clothes from the thrift store.  Once your weight settles, rebuild your wardrobe.  It gets expensive, if you are limited financially like me, be prepared to spend money on clothes that first year- save up, ask around for hand me downs, take advantage of afterpay lol.  

Find goals to reach that don't have to do with your scale.  The scale doesn't matter.  Adding to that: stay off it the first 2 months after surgery if you know it will bother you not to see a loss.  Try not to get on it more than once a week.  If its making you feel crazy, put it away or give it to a friend to hold.  You will not see a loss every week.  You will have stalls.  This is a natural part of this process- remember your body is healing from a big trauma.  Give it time! 

 Post op diet options are mostly all sweet.  The only savory option is cottage cheese.  It can be doctored up different ways to make it taste like something else.  Pizza seasoning, ranch seasoning, and chili seasoning were good mix ins I enjoyed.  

Do not buy a ton of protein before surgery.  You don't know what your body will like.  Before surgery, get a few samples of different things to try post-op to find the one that works for you. You can usually buy sample pouches of powder mixes online or at GNC. One premixed bottle of protein is going to last you a day if not more.  You will not need cases of it.  I found out I hate protein water, but you might love it.  I could not drink powder mix, I need the premade shakes. I gave away and threw out so much protein that didnt work for me.  It was a massive waste of money. Don't be like me, buy samples and buy one premade bottle of a few different brands.  My favorites are premier protein and fairlife.

Listen to your body, it will tell you what it needs.  If you're craving sugary stuff a lot, you probably havent been drinking enough water or getting enough protein.  It will signal you when you are full, but it might be weird.  I get a nice big hiccup.  It sounds like a bird sometimes so my family says the bird is fed and saying thank you.

 Those first few days post-op, do not skip those walks.  All you will want to do is sleep.  They really suck, but they will help you feel better faster.  Have support at home the first week at least.  You will need help getting out of bed and if something goes wrong, there will be someone to take you to the er.

I hope this reaches someone and helps them feel better today.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask!",13,1757831366.0,GastricBypass,0,0.94,False

Packing
- I bought instant freeze packs on Amazon before my trip and those came in handy. Each pack stays ice cold for about 15 mins which was how long my ice sessions were. My hotel did not have in-room freezers and I didn‚Äôt want to have to get ice in the middle of the night. 
- Anything else you will need ( scar cream, cotton swabs, saline spray, face wipes etc‚Ä¶) can be found at Olive Young and/or a Pharmacy which will most likely be within walking distance as they are everywhere.

SIM Card
Check that your phone is not locked to a carrier if you are getting a SIM. I bought an SK Telecom SIM card at the airport when I arrived. It cost $40 for 20 days of unlimited calls, data and SMS. They also gave me a free T-money card and a bag of goodies. I did not think of unlocking my phone before traveling and had issues activating the Korean SIM. I ended up calling my carrier and luckily they were able to unlock it for me within minutes.

Transportation
I walked or used Uber to commute while I was there. Uber is very affordable in Seoul. To give you an idea, the Uber ride from Incheon to my hotel in Seoul (1h10 min ride) was 60 000 KRW.
If you want to visit Busan while you‚Äôre there you can use KTX from Seoul station.

Accommodation
I stayed at Hotel Eliena. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. I did not experience any language barrier during my stay as everyone at the front desk spoke English . One of the restaurants in the hotel had pumpkin soup on the menu which I lived off of for a couple of days post-op. 
The hotel seems to be very popular for weddings; the lobby was crowded every Saturdays and Sundays. Wedding guests needed the elevators to get to the reception halls and there are only 2 elevators which meant long wait time for all of us. The staircase access was locked so that wasn‚Äôt an option. 
Each floor has an ice machine which was nice.
When I had do not disturb on my door, instead of skipping my room entirely, room service was leaving a bag with spare towels, water bottles, slippers and coffee. 
I picked the hotel because of quality and price; It was $2200 for 3 weeks which was good. 

Food
There are restaurants everywhere and they stay open pretty late. If you are undergoing FC surgery, you won‚Äôt run out of options soft food to eat (yogurt stores, soups, steamed eggs, fish ‚Ä¶)

Apps
I recommend downloading the following apps:
- Uber
- Shuttle: I used Shuttle for food delivery. Most delivery drivers did not speak English and the receipts were in Korean so I had no way to tell which order was mine. The front desk offered to help translate every time which was nice. 
- Papago: When shopping alone I used Papago to translate. You can also translate pictures which came in handy to translate menus at restaurants
- Naver Maps: Google Maps did not work for me. It would either not find the location or give wrong directions. Naver Maps was user friendly. I also used it to check reviews from locals.

One last thing: if you‚Äôre traveling from a place that is moderate all year long, avoid going in July. It is scorching HOT! It only rained twice the 3 weeks that I was there. Walking helps with recovery and you won‚Äôt be able to due to the heat. You will also be uncomfortable if you have to wear any post op compression garment.",3,1757830961.0,SeoulPlasticSurgery,3,1.0,False

After a few hours of search, zeroed in on a small homestay near Mallalli falls and booked the place. 6 am Saturday morning, we head out and stop for breakfast at Swati Delicacy near Yediyur. After some piping hot vada and dose, we are on the road again and our first stop is the Windmills of Mavanur.

[Windmill of Mavanur Temple](https://reddit.com/link/1ngjpin/video/1e3l34g8n2pf1/player)

We were the only people at the temple and its was absolutely peaceful and quiet. We could only hear the gentle breeze and peacocks calling out. After 30 min of enjoying the company of windmills, we head back onto NH75 and cross Hassan. On a whim, we take the turn towards Haluvagilu falls and once again, we are the only people there. Haluvagilu is a small check dam and the water was in full flow thanks to the abundant rains over the last few weeks. There are sign boards that clearly callout the danger of walking across the check dam and we decide to enjoy the view and the quiet beauty of the place.

After 30 blissful minutes, we decide to leave as people start to trickle in. We head back onto the NH and stop for a quick coffee, after which we take some beautiful interior roads to reach the grassland of Hethur. As we walk down the slope towards the lone tree, a fine drizzle starts and automatically there is a spring in our steps. After 15 minutes, a group of bikers decide to drive down the trail to the tree and we decide to head towards our next destination, which is Mallalli falls.

After another hour of winding, relaxing drive through the hills of North Coorg, we reach the parking area of Mallalli falls. Thanks to the rains, the falls is roaring and we decide not to trek down all the way as its quiet crowded. We trek down 1/4 the distance and enjoy the view of the falls.

After 30 minutes, we are back on the road, heading to Naisarga Homestay. After a sumptuous lunch, we relax in the balcony of the homestay and enjoy the view. The first couple of hours, the sun was playing hide and seek, after which the clouds started rolling in. Through the evening and night, the pitter patter of rain was the perfect background music and we enjoyed sipping on hot coffee, pakodas and 80/90s music.

The ground floor of the homestay has a living + dining area and the first floor is the bedroom + bathroom. Food is simple but tasty homecooked coorgi fare and we absolutely enjoyed the food. Do note that this is a very simple and basic homestay, hence you will need to carry your own towels/toiletries.",1,1757830738.0,IndiaRoadTrips,0,1.0,False

1ngjo3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastroparesis/comments/1ngjo3f/cardiorunning_gp/,Cardio/running & GP,"Hi all,
I‚Äôve had GP for many years now, had some success with the pyloric Botox so will be having a G-POEM at the end of the year. After initially dropping a significant amount of weight very fast, my weight is now stable, I don‚Äôt really vomit very much but my main symptom is severe, intractable nausea that improves but does not abate with high doses of antiemetics. I mostly tolerate eating in the evenings the easiest. 

I am getting into running and really enjoying it, but finding cardio very hard to do with GP. I can have a few sips of water and that is all before most things - work/exercise/particularly cardio. If I eat or drink and then do cardio I absolutely will vomit. So I‚Äôm in this routine of waking up, eventually going for a run, coming home and trying to drink water, have a coffee (I know it‚Äôs not meant to be good for you, but I have very little joy in food/drink and that is it) and then going to work, getting home late in the evening and eating a meal and then feeling sick. I do try to drink protein shakes in the day but often not able to. 

Anyone else out there who enjoys exercise who can give me any tips or tricks? I want to be able to keep this sustainable. ",1,1757830597.0,Gastroparesis,2,1.0,False
