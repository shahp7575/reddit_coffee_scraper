1r0vfpa,https://i.redd.it/3w0wce58pmig1.jpeg,Brief review/summary of my experience with the Konkr Pocket Fit 16/512Gb White.,"Hello Everyone! I just wanted to share a brief summary of my experience with the Konkr Pocket Fit, after one week of use. Hopefully, it might still be helpful to someone.

**Disclaimer.**

Please, bear in mind that, although I'm not a fan of Ayaneo as a company, and surely I didn't enjoy the way in which they handled the entire project, this is not a review of the company itself. Also, I appreciate that probably too many devices were delivered in poor conditions, with many people rightly upset about it, but many others were just fine. Although, I'm sure, we are all dealing with some kind of software issue.

Finally, important to know is that I already own the Retroid Pocket 5.

**Final thought.**

I'm going to start with the conclusion.

So far, I’m really enjoying this retro handheld, because it's giving me the experience I was looking for: a plug and play experience with almost all, if not all the video games of systems up to and including Nintendo Switch. Even PS3 and Xbox games are playable with this, but being the emulation of these two systems still far from being anywhere near optimised, some tweaking most likely is going to be required and many games will simply not work. And, of course, you can also play PC games with this.

Overall, this is an all-round retro handheld thanks to the almighty Snapdragon G3 gen 3, which benefits from the full custom GPU drivers compatibility, with a power not far off from the one of the 8 Elite.

**The delivery.**

So, I ordered the 12/256Gb white version on the 6th of November 2025, backing the project on Indiegogo.

On the 5th of December I upgraded it to 16/512Gb.

Nothing happened until the 19th of January, when the status of the order was updated to ""Ready for shipping"". Then, the following day it was updated again to ""Shipped"".

Finally, on the 3rd of February I received the parcel.

So, yes, it is frustrating to see how January's orders have been delivered way faster.

**The handheld.**

The Konkr Pocket Fit is a beautiful device that doesn't feel cheap at all, which is also extremely comfortable and ergonomic. This handheld feels really like a console and not like a toy.

**The buttons.**

The buttons are really quiet and they feel really good. Overall you can game without annoying the people sitting next to you. Of course, as we all know at this point, the analog sticks are the exception (more on this later). It has so many buttons that I wouldn’t even be able to configure and use them all, without forgetting what they do. Personal preference for sure, but I don’t even mind having the start and select button at the bottom left, instead of having them with the typical “Switch” layout at the top left and right. But, of course, since the majority of buttons are fully configurable, any layout can be created.

**The screen.**

Over the few months waiting for the device, I read and heard any type of comment about it. So, I really didn't know what to expect and I placed my expectations really low.

And, I mean, I'm just going to say that I was shocked! That display is freaking stunning!

Honestly, I'm not fussy at all about displays, as long as they have good colours. But, this display is just insane for being a LCD! To be completely honest, if I didn't know it was a LCD, I'm sure, I wouldn't have noticed it. Also, it gets really bright.

Now, to be completely fair, you can notice the difference if you compare both types of displays side by side. And paying a little more attention, you can notice how the colours are not as vivid as they are on an OLED. But, I mean, ultimately it is up to you to decide if playing video games or training to become a reviewer. :-)

**The speakers.**

Surely, I didn’t expect a handheld to sound this loud and this good out of the box. Also, with the built-in equalizer things can be improved even further. Overall, you can use these speakers to watch videos or movies, as well as listening to some good music.

**The fan.**

I'm telling you, I really can't see how this handheld could ever become hot. The fan is just like a jet engine when set on the maximum speed! Overall, I wouldn't describe this fan as loud by any means, besides when it is set to “Full”. Surely, it does the job.

**The battery.**

This is another aspect I didn't expect to be this good. I haven't monitored the battery drain since there are plenty of reviews out there where they “professionally” do it, however what I can tell you is that it lasts a lot! While emulating the Switch with Eden, I noticed approximately 3 times longer sessions than while using the Retroid Pocket 5. Of course, comparing with the very same games but with a better set up for the Konkr Pocket Fit.

**The POWER!**

What is mindblowing is the power of this handheld. Of course, I did expect the Snapdragon G3 gen 3 with 16Gb of ram to be this powerful, but coming from a Snapdragon 865 with 8Gb of Ram, seriously, there is no way to compare those. You can really feel the generational leap between those two processors. With this configuration the limit in what games you can play is given by the state of development of the emulators and not by the requirements to make the games or the systems run. Which means, a little to none tweaking to make any game work just fine.

**What I dislike.**

* Something I really disliked since the very beginning is the Ayaneo style menu, “Aya Home”. I think it is unnecessary and it might not be as intuitive as it should be. Fortunately, you can disable it by picking the app that you like, going on: Settings - Default Apps - Default home app.
* The analog sticks are weird. Not only are they tiny, but I feel the plastic material is also cheaper than any other plastic used in this handheld. They feel out of place, as if they weren't meant for this handheld at all. Don't get me wrong, they are usable and honestly I don't mind them. However, I think I will replace them with slightly larger sticks.

**The issues.**

* The RGB lights of the analog sticks. I had to turn them off because if you reduce the brightness they start to flicker, A LOT! And when they do it, they keep on flickering even when you turn them off, and the only way to make them stop is by restarting the device.
* I had a few instances where the auto-rotate function randomly stopped working and the display was stuck in portrait mode. I noticed this especially while using Google Chrome. The only way to make it work again was by either using the force landscape function or by restarting the device.
* Although, I’m not sure whether it is caused by the device or not, I had an issue with the SD card. Moving it from the Retroid Pocket 5 to the Konkr Pocket Fit a message appeared saying to format the card before using it. As you can imagine it has been really annoying and it took many hours!

**Accessories.**

I also bought the storage bag and I mean, I don't know what type of chemical they used, but the smell was so strong that I was able to smell it from next room. It was just insane! I couldn't use it and I had to leave it outside for a few days to make the smell dissipate. I also used a few coffee beans for the inside.",1,1770712500.0,RetroHandhelds,0,1.0,False

1r0vfky,https://i.redd.it/9h143zubpmig1.jpeg,I worked remotely for years… then I experienced office life in Kenya. It changed how I see work 💁🏻‍♀️,"I have two jobs rn  and worked remotely for several years before transitioning into one in-office role at a cooperate company based in Kenya. The adjustment was more profound than I expected…. You guys aren’t batshit here on Reddit when you talk about drama and work relationships, fuck 😂. Remote work had conditioned me to be evaluated primarily on output. Office life introduced an additional layer of “visibility” and performance. 

In the office I noticed that presence carries weight. For instance i… noticed tha say arrival time, participation in meetings, and physical availability often become informal signals of commitment. I noticed that people sometimes arrived early or stayed late less for productivity and more for perception and ofc performance . Meetings tended to run longer than necessary, while focused work often happened quietly, outside the spotlight.

What stood out most wasn’t the workload but the emphasis on optics. Completing tasks efficiently didn’t always translate to recognition if it wasn’t accompanied by visible effort. Finishing early could even raise questions rather than appreciation to be honest 😂.

There is also an unspoken awareness that develops in shared spaces …. who comes in late, who leaves early, who is frequently absent, who socializes, and who keeps to themselves. These observations subtly influence how people are perceived, even when performance remains consistent. Heck i clashed with someone since i used a mug used by HR section ( i had to use a mug since I hadn’t packed or bought coffee that day ) . Not forgetting the day i left slightly early by like 3 minutes to avoid parking exit tomfoolery , the next morning i had looks that would literally be seen in a riot 😭. 

Also like people come early just to be seen, then spend the first hour discussing traffic, politics, and whose boss is worse . No… I don’t have a problem I’m just stating my observation . Meetings last 90 minutes to conclude what could’ve been a two-paragraph WhatsApp message.

Having experienced both remote and in-office environments, I’ve come to appreciate how remote work minimizes performative elements and centers results. Office environments offer collaboration and structure, but they can also prioritize presence over productivity if not managed intentionally.

The transition taught me that the future of work isn’t about choosing one model over the other it’s about recognizing what we reward. When visibility outweighs value, we risk confusing activity with impact. It’s a learning experience thaaat is NOT fun but I appreciate I can see both sides . And for everyone working in cooperate … I give you flowers and a red lipstick kiss on your cute forehead fr 💋 🫶.",7,1770712487.0,Kenya,0,1.0,False

I’m 27M Indian, living in Abu Dhabi, moved 6 months ago.

Most of my close friends are married now, and I’ve realized it’s actually pretty hard to make new friends as an adult 😅 so I thought I’d put myself out there.

I’m looking for genuine friendships, people to chat with, grab coffee, go on walks, try new food spots, or just hang out and decompress after a long week.

A bit about me:

• I enjoy good conversations and low-key plans

• Love cafes, long walks, and exploring the city

• Into books, and meaningful talks

• Also down for spontaneous plans once in a while

I don’t know how to drive tho🫣

If you’re in a similar phase of life and looking to make new friends, feel free to comment or DM

Not looking for anything serious, no pressure at all. Just meeting someone new outside the usual routine. If it clicks, cool. If it doesn’t, also cool, at least we tried.

1. I do not invest in stocks. In the 25+ years that I did invest in stocks, I'm probably net negative overall. My net worth is 95% invested in real estate.
2. I did not receive any assistance from inheritance or relatives, aside from my parents paying for 2 years of university and 2 years of community college. No significant, unexpected monetary gifts. Same with my wife.
3. My reported social security income is quite a bit different than my actual income due to large rental property tax deductions. However, from 2009-2013 I was essentially unemployed, making almost $0 and living off saved money and roommates.
4. My wife does make good income as a pharmacist and purchased our current home before we were married.
5. I'm semi-retired as of a couple years ago.

As a B2B operation, quit while you're behind, here's why 👇","Many people who are part of CPG brands (across the supply chain) communities barely engage because these communities don't give them any reason to,

they are more focused on promos - not much value is offered, but so much could be provided to them.

For example, the most lucrative spaces are Wealth, Health and Relationships, because that's what most people are concerned about, so you need to figure out;



**how can they gain these in the industry that your brand operates in**?



There is no need to decenter the three themes (wealth, health and relationships) from your brand identity. For example, say you only distribute a mushroom based coffee -

→You could talk about how to maintain your health due to workplace strains and pressures in the functional foods sector.

→You could talk about the diverse health benefits of your product and how it aids your customers on a day-to-day basis.

→You could inform them about the wealth opportunities currently available in the supplements industry and how to exploit them perhaps?

→You could create a network of relationships for people in and those interested in getting into the industry via your community.



The value you decide to offer is only limited by your imagination (and your interpretation of your subscribers' preferences), but this has to be the kind of value that your clients/subscribers are willing to pay for because the value resonates with their desires (regarding wealth, health and relationships).

See it as another one of your offers - but service based, an offer that not only provides you with additional or consistent monthly subscription revenue but also:



→High client retention levels.

→Primary/1st party client behaviour data.

→Multiple mediums/channels to atomize (stretch) your content.

→Client influenced brand decisions - fostering a closer relationship.

→A fully automated asset that doesn't take too much time to manage.



Including numerous other benefits that prove and showcase the value of this asset. Does your brand have a community? If so, how are you operating it from a retention and sales perspective?",1,1770712040.0,CPGDistributors,0,1.0,False

1r0v9ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r0v9ti/someone_please_tell_me_this_isnt_normal/,Someone Please Tell me This isn't Normal,"This is my final resort. I need someone, ANYONE to admit that this isn't normal. When I was younger I survived an incident so strange and horrific it should have made world news but instead nobody cares. Let me be clear, people believe the story happened, they just don't give a shit. They listen and then say things like, “So what?” Or “Makes sense.” Then if I ask them if it happened to their family they instead respond with a simple, “Nah, not mine.” Then if I ask if they know anyone who it did happen to they say, “Other than you? Nah, man.” 

  I admit, I hate the internet, I hate reddit, I hate suckers who go online and require other people’s opinions to feel good about their own. But, where else can I go? My family, friends, strangers on the street, they all treat what happened to me like the most ordinary shit.



It all happened when I was twelve. I was a normal kid, I played Yu-Gi-Oh!, I loved football, I had a normal life. I lived with my Mum, Dad, my cat Misty and my younger sister Mandy. Mandy was only ten, she was normal too. Mum and Dad were also normal to be fair, it was a normal family. I just want to really put that into perspective first. We weren’t cultists, secret murderers or anything supernatural, just people.

  Anyway, one early morning at around 4:30am I heard a soft *splat* on my window. It sounded like someone hit the glass with a sopping wet cloth. I mean *drenched* wet, like so full it would make you grunt when you lifted it. I turned to the window, rubbing my little eyes. In my head I was assuming it’d be a bird or maybe Dad clowning around (which would still be weird). Instead I saw two massive eyes, nearly as big as saucers. They’re this deep green colour, greener than a human’s eye could be. Surrounding these giant eyes was greying, almost rotten looking skin. The skin sat loose on this thing's face, you could see a deep red under the creature’s eyes because the bottom eyelid was so heavy. The rest of the head was somewhat normal, a little nose, a tiny grin with regular lips, ears maybe too small but the head was fat and swollen. The head needed more space to comfortably house those disgusting eyes and so it looked mutated. Growths grew from the side of the things head, just by the eyes. When it blinked the growths would tense and swell more, I thought they were gonna pop. It stood hunched, its head leaning forward, forehead bashing against the glass. The body was so long, like you put a man through a steam roller and thinned him out like a cartoon. If he was able to stand up straight he would have been taller than the house, but he couldn’t stand up straight. Instead he hunched so far forward he nearly looked like a diving board, every so often he’d extend his long arms and gangly fingers to stop himself from toppling over. His knees were so bent, bowed out like a hideous freakish mutant. He wore no clothes and his feet were as long as a rabbit’s would be at his size. Where his dick would be was just flesh, roiling and swirling as he stretched, like there was something there and it was ripped off and replaced with loose fatty tissue.

  This thing was standing outside my window, whacking his bulbous head into the glass. Whenever he did he would leave this greasy stain. It was brown and thick like oil, it drooled down the glass and pooled on the brick windowsill outside. I screamed, I screamed like a little baby, “Dad?! Help!” When I screamed the thing opened its little mouth and began coughing, gagging like it was choking but its eyes were trained on me, the lids pinching into an angry glare. 

  My father stormed in, a cricket bat in one hand, only in his undies, “Josh? Buddy, what’s wrong?!” I tumbled out of bed and hid behind my Dad, pointing at that awful thing, “Joshy, what is wrong with you?” He asked, leaning the bat against the wall outside my room, “Go on, let him in.”

  I shit you not, he was acting like that cartoony, bizarre fucker at my window was an old friend. I told him no and demanded he call the police or SOMEONE. Instead he shook his head and opened the front door himself. Then it walked in, slowly, it moved like it had an anchor hanging from its legs. Step by step it slowly slid into the home, burping and growling bizarrely. It slipped past my Dad and walked right to me, I screamed and said, “Go away! Dad, make it go away!” But my Dad just laughed at me, he pointed and chuckled like I was being pranked. Oddly it put me slightly at ease, I immediately thought it was a puppet. The creature got within a couple inches and began sniffing, its little nose bouncing up and down. Its mouth hung open and gave it an odd shocked expression. The skin on its face was so hefty, it dragged everything down with it. From its head to its legs it was a full six meters long. My Dad kept laughing, “Jesus, Joshy, what’s gotten into ya?” He asked in between howling laughs.

  I chuckled awkwardly, staring at this gawking thing, “It’s, it’s kinda cool I guess.” I said and Dad shrugged as to say, *not what I’d call it but I guess.* As it eyed me down and gurgled, swallowing heaping phlegm down its throat I decided to check what it was made from, still assuming it was a puppet or prop. I reached out and its eyes tracked my hands, moments before I grabbed it my father lurched forward and leaned over the beast grabbing my wrist.

  “Don’t.” He said bluntly, staring into my soul, “Please, don’t.” The whole demeanor of normality dropped at that moment. I started to cry and the creature reared up slightly, its back filling the air with awful clicks and cracks. It then looked at my Dad and hissed like an angered cat. My Dad laughed again and pointed at me, “Josh is such a dickhead, ain’t ya? He’s just goofing around.”

  I stared in horror as my Dad spoke to it, casually, like an old family friend. The thing leaned back down and sauntered through my house, leaving my room. It continued to move slowly, its body tilting and leaning like it had the spine of a snake. It sniffed around and bumped into things, gurgling and burping as it did. I collapsed onto the floor in a heap and sobbed, Dad came in with a smile, “Buddy, he’s fine. What’s your problem?”

  “Look at him, Dad!” I snapped, “He’s a freak, a monster?” I was waving my arms around, baffled at how my father spoke.

  “Well,” he said, smirk firmly on his cheek, “just be polite.” The smile dropped and he leaned in, “Please?”

  “Why though?” I asked, “What is it?”

  “It’s,” he stopped and thought for an absurd amount of time, “a friend, I guess. Look, we’re lucky, you should know this?” He shook his head in confusion and I tilted to look around him, watching the thing slink its way around a corner, towards Mandy’s room. I pointed and my mouth hung wide open.

  “Mandy, it’s going to Mandy!” I yelled, stumbling around trying to stand.

  Dad shrugged, “Who cares? Let him do his thing, buddy.” He then slowly meandered back to his bedroom. I watched and listened in horror, waiting for something awful to happen. I finally gave up being a coward and grabbed the bat Dad left behind. I held it tightly in my hands and ventured towards the monster. I turned the final corner and came face to ass with the thing. Half its body was in Mandy’s room and the other half was extended into the hallway. 

  “Mandy?!” I called out, a giggle was my only response. “Mandy, are you okay?” Giggling again. The thing's backside was very human but warped and changed like the rest of its flesh, the ass cheeks were so long, drooping down from the weight. After what Dad did when I nearly touched it I didn’t want to just squeeze past. I used the bat and pushed its body out of the way, slowly inching along the wall toward Mandy. Giggles, burps and gulps filled the open air. I finally entered her room and saw Mandy sitting on the edge of her bed in her Hello Kitty pyjamas. She was squeezing the bulbs and fleshy hunks on the creature’s face. “Mandy, no!” I snapped and used the bat to tap her knuckles lightly. She recoiled and her eyes were wide with panic, “It’s okay, come on, we’ll hide in my room!” 

  She wiped away tears and softly said, “Don’t tell Daddy, please?”

  “What?” I responded. The thing started to move, backing up slowly like a truck in reverse.

  “I know I shouldn’t touch him but he’s so cute. Don’t tell Daddy.” She was sobbing at that point.

  I squeezed fully into Mandy’s room and watched the freak escape backwards, once its eyes finally locked onto me it snarled and hissed the same way it hissed at Dad. I aimed the bat at its face, like a swordsman or a loser. It finally stopped its reverse and coiled around its enormously long body to slither back out the hallway. Mandy tugged on my shirt, “Are you gonna tell?” She asked.

  “What?” I mumbled out, “What the hell are you talking about?”

  “Don’t be a dibby dobber.” She did an exaggerated frown.

  “Mandy, what the hell? It’s a monster, what are you talking about?” I dropped the bat and held my little sister.

  “Don’t call him that.” She cried softly into my shoulder, “He’s my friend.” For the rest of the night I sat cross legged on Mandy’s floor, listening as the awful thing smashed apart our house. I heard bags of chips tumble from the pantry and chairs being knocked over. I was shivering, terrified, not sure what it was capable of. My sister fell asleep within minutes, softly breathing. By 6:00am I was miserably tired and still horrified, I heard something come down the hallway. I jumped up and held the bat high above my head. 

  Turning around the corner was my Mum, still in her pyjamas. “Jeez, Josh. You really are on edge.” She laughed, “Couldn’t sleep?” She asked.

  “Is it gone?” I asked.

  “Is *he* gone? No, not yet. Sorry he kept you up, quite a loud fella, ain’t he?” She tussled my hair.

  “Mum,” I stammered out, “what is going on? Who is he?”

  “A friend?” She said with confusion, “Did you forget?”

  “I guess.” I responded softly, staring at the floor, “Why can’t we touch him?”

  “He’ll hurt you,” Mum responded, “I must have forgotten to tell you.”

  “Mandy did,” I said, “she was grabbing his face.”

  Mum slapped her forehead and shook Mandy awake, “Hey baby?” She asked, “Did you touch our friend’s face?”

  Mandy kicked me hard in the back, “Why did you dob?” She squealed. I gawked in horror and confusion. “Mum, am I going to die?” She asked softly, the words sounded so awful coming from her mouth. Death wasn’t something she ever really spoke about, she was a child. Yet she asked so casually, like *what are we gonna do today?* Casually.

  Mum nodded, running her fingers through her bed hair, “Yeah baby. Gonna have to call the school.” She tussled my hair again, “Thank you for telling me, you’re a good big brother.” Before leaving. As I stared in horror I began to hear the soft conversation of my parents in the other room. Quickly followed by my Dad’s booming voice.

  “She did *what?!”* He sounded furious, not scared, “How many times do we need to warn them?!”

  I slowly made my way out, bat once again in hand. I turned and saw my Dad in uniform for work and Mum pacing around, “Chris, darling, she’s just a kid.”

  Dad waved his hands around, “So what? I was smarter than that when I was her age. It’s gonna be such a mess.”  He shook his head and then saw me, “Hey, buddy!” As he spoke the beast emerged from my parents’ room, burping and snarling. Its little mouth was coiled into a tiny smile and his dangling arms were covered in blood.

  I jumped back and pointed, “Is that blood?”

  Mum nodded, “Yeaaah,” she said in an awkwardly drawn out way, “he got Misty.” She shook her head and then jokingly said to the creature, “Couldn’t have done it on the tiles?” This got a laugh out of Dad and the monster just coughed in response, the odd smirk on his face. 

  “Misty?” I asked “He killed Misty?” My hands were trembling, I was biting my lip, trying not to cry. “Why?”

  “Such an annoying cat,” my Dad said, grabbing a coffee he had made himself, “what a waste.” 

  “A waste?!” I snapped, “You *loved* Misty!”

  “Yeah,” he responded, “but hey. Better he enjoys his stay.” Dad took a long sip of his coffee. The creature rubbed the blood off its hands and onto the back of the couch. It then scuttled its hideously long body towards me. In a moment of unfiltered rage, horror and confusion I raised the bat high above my head, ready to swing. Moments before the monster was close enough something hard and hot smashed against the side of my face. “Don’t you fucking dare!” My Dad screamed, fear on his face. I tumbled to the floor, sliding across the hardwood, coffee pouring down my cheek. He had launched the mug at me, “Do you realise how close you just came?”

  “Close to what?” I stammered out, gripping the side of my head, “Why’d you throw that at me?!”

  “Sorry, my son is acting so weirdly.” He walked over to the freak and snatched the bat from my hand. “He *won’t* do it again, will you?!” He snarled at me.

  I just started to cry, the snake-man watching me, burping like a sick baby. It then whispered something I couldn’t understand. It just softly whispered gibberish. I pushed myself back and it took two slow steps towards me, its legs still on the opposite side of the house. It was looking me up and down, whispering. 

  “Go on,” Mum said, “go get ready for school.”



I protested and protested all morning but eventually Dad took my by the ear and forced me to get ready. The side of my face was bleeding and burnt, Dad had to pluck a small piece of ceramic from my skin. The entire time I was getting ready this awful thing watched, it opened my door and peaked in before slithering away. I hated it. Mandy got a scolding from Dad, but it was odd. It was mostly, *you dumb girl, did I not teach you enough?* And a lack of, *I’m so sorry, you’re going to die.* He really just seemed annoyed, mildly impeded. 

  At school my friends gave me useless advice, because they all didn’t care.

  Jamie said, “Okay? Anyway, Mum’s getting me the new COD for Christmas.”

  Samantha said, “Dude, I always wondered what that’d be like. So cool!”

  Peter said, “You’re such a little bitch man, you also scared of bunnies?”

  No matter who I pleaded to they just didn’t care, nobody fucking cared. It was like someone came into my house, wrecked everything and the police shrugged with a simple, *good luck, dickhead.* Even my English teacher Mr Harper just said, “God, Josh, your poor parents. I’d hate to be the one cleaning all that up!”

  By the time I got back home I was tired, scared and damn near suicidal. Genuinely. I didn’t know what else to do, it was like the world just forgot to warn me about the most important event in your life. Or everyone was fucking with me, *everyone.* Somewhere deep in my heart I still wanted to believe it was a puppet and somehow my parents had told every single one of my friends to be in on the joke. But, what kind of joke is launching a mug at your son? I felt insane, stupid, I felt manic. Walking into my house was a nightmare, everything was knocked over. The couch was pushed through a glass sliding door, the glistening pieces scattered across the floor. My kitchen table was on its side, the entire kitchen was covered in mushed up food. Mum was sitting on the only unmoved chair, tapping away on her phone.

  “Hey sweetie!” She cooed.

  “Where is it?” I asked, looking around.

  “In your room,” she responded, “stop saying *it*. He, darling, *he.”* I turned my head and looked at my room, the sheets of my bed were torn apart, the window completely smashed. The coiled up body of the thing was filling the entire floor space, towering up on itself like a pile of melted pudding. As I scanned up its body I saw it was looking at me, its eyes so massive, pointing one of its arms at me. It then screeched and flung itself forward, screaming. I immediately took off running, it had never moved this fast. I ran as fast as I could, my Mum laughing in the other room. The screeching was so loud, it barreled past all the overturned furniture and smashed it to the side. It was deafening, screaming, laughing, crashing, screaming, laughing, crashing, screaming, laughing, crashing, screaming, laughing, crashing, screaming, laughing, crashing, screaming, laughing, crashing, screaming, laughing, crashing, screaming, laughing, crashing.

  I threw open the door of the toilet and slammed it behind myself, locking it. A loud *BANG* caused the door to splinter and bend. The screaming stopped and instead the air was filled with that odd whispering. The door warped as the monster pressed its body weight against it, I cried and curled into a ball. “Please stop.” I whimpered, “Please.” Hours passed, the thing never moved, every so often it would push firmly against the door. I called out for help and only received laughter from my family, Dad telling me to stop being a weirdo.

  As 9:30pm rolled around I finally heard the creature move, the door clicked back into place and the thing left, burping as it went. I waited another few minutes before leaving. Mum and Dad were on the couch watching shows, they turned to face me. The couch was covered in slashes and the TV had a huge green line through the pixels. “Hey, buddy.” Dad said, “Done freaking out?” He asked. I looked around and tried to find the thing.

  “It’s with Mandy,” Mum said, “hoping he does it some place easier to clean than the carpet.”

  “What?” I said, “It’s gonna kill her tonight?”

  Dad nodded, “Yeah, tonight or tomorrow morning probably.” He took a sip of a beer. 

  “We have to stop it.” I turned to run and Dad caught the back of my shirt.

  “Quit fucking around, Josh.” He snapped, “One more fucking outburst and you’re sleeping outside. What has gotten into you?”

  As he did this I heard Mandy giggle and the sound of the behemoth scuttling down the hall. I turned and saw the freak carrying Mandy, the extra weight making its head crash into the floor, dragging brown gunk along the ground. It burped and whimpered and swallowed disgustingly. Mandy was waving her arms around joyously, “Look Mummy, look!” She called out.

  “I see, sweetheart!” Mum responded, clapping her hands.

  Dad’s grip was firm on my shirt, he was staring at me with the glare of a furious military general. “Please,” I whimpered, “do *something.”* 

  Dad shook his head, “Sit down and shut up.” He yanked me backwards and held me against the arm of the couch. The freak lowered Mandy to the floor and laid her on her back, his eyes locked on me. He smiled softly and began whispering to me. The only word I finally gathered was.

  “Watch.”

  It then lifted its head way into the air, the torso thunked against the ceiling. Mandy was giggling and kicking her legs and arms around. The creature brought its head down, like a giant boulder. It slammed into Mandy’s chest, she immediately screamed in pain and wheezed as the wind got knocked out of her. She coiled into a ball and cried, “Stop.” She murmured, barely audible. The thing lifted its mighty head again, I desperately tried to break free from Dad’s grip. At that point I noticed him and Mum were howling with laughter. The monster’s head came back down, this time smashing into Mandy’s side, her ribs crunching, blood seeping through her clothes. She sputtered out another plea for the monster to stop, “Please.” 

  I had enough, I couldn’t watch this anymore. I leaned and grabbed Dad’s beer, smashing it over his head. He ducked down in pain, his laughter stopping. I stood up and stabbed the bottle’s sharp end into the thing’s stomach. It then stopped, dropped back down and let out a final little huff before running towards the front door. It stumbled a few times and crashed right through, knocking the door off its hinges. 

  I dropped the glass and scooped Mandy into my arms, “Are you okay?” I asked, “Mandy?” She tucked her head into my shirt and I watched Dad stand up, wandering into the kitchen. Mum was shaking her head. Dad picked up his phone and dialed something.

  Mum then snapped at me, “Look what you did, you scared him off.” She tossed the TV remote, “We were so fucking lucky!”

  Dad was calling an ambulance for Mandy, I remember hearing him say, “Yeah, it’s gone, no point in letting it play out anymore.”



Years have passed now, I’ve moved out and Mandy grew up normally, thank God. What was odd was that as the years went on Mandy slowly took my parents side again, saying that she wishes I never *‘ruined it,’* and that she wouldn’t have cried if it happened again. Mum and Dad were mad at me for months, not really explaining anything. Eventually they fixed the house back up and we all kind of moved past it.

  Now as an adult I’ve tried asking around, nobody acts like this was abnormal, like it's to be expected. Most people seem mad at me when I tell them about saving Mandy. I posted this story to another forum, asking if it was normal. The page got taken down, the mods said I wasn’t allowed to ask, *‘generic questions.’* So this is my last option, someone, please, explain what happened. Tell me it wasn’t normal, PLEASE.",3,1770711860.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

Quit while you're behind, here's why 👇","Many people who are part of CPG brand communities barely engage because these communities don't give them any reason to,

they are more focused on promos - not much value is offered, but so much could be provided to them.

For example, the most lucrative spaces are Wealth, Health and Relationships, because that's what most people are concerned about, so you need to figure out;

**how can they gain these in the industry that your brand operates in**?

There is no need to decenter the three themes (wealth, health and relationships) from your brand identity. For example, say you offer a mushroom based coffee -

→You could talk about how to maintain your health due to workplace strains and pressures in the supplements industry.

→You could talk about the diverse health benefits of your product and how it aids your customers on a day-to-day basis.

→You could inform them about the wealth opportunities currently available in the supplements industry and how to exploit them perhaps?

→You could create a network of relationships for people in and those interested in getting into the industry via your community.

The value you decide to offer is only limited by your imagination (and your interpretation of your subscribers' preferences), but this has to be the kind of value that your customers/subscribers are willing to pay for because the value resonates with their desires (regarding wealth, health and relationships).

See it as another one of your offers - but service based, an offer that not only provides you with additional or consistent monthly subscription revenue but also:

→High customer retention levels.

→Primary/1st party consumer behaviour data.

→Multiple mediums/channels to atomize (stretch) your content.

→A fully automated asset that doesn't take too much time to manage.

→Customer influenced brand decisions - fostering a closer relationship.

Including numerous other benefits that prove and showcase the value of this asset. Does your brand have a community? If so, how are you operating it from a retention and sales perspective?",1,1770711630.0,CPGIndustry,0,1.0,False

This is about a guy 22M (he lives in New Haven) I had a very long, very complicated situationship with for about a year. 

We met through mutual friends and were just friends at first. Then his mom passed away unexpectedly. They were extremely close. Around the same time, my aunt passed away. After that, we got a lot closer. It wasn’t like we immediately hooked up or anything — we just became very close, talking constantly, checking in on each other, etc. Eventually it turned very romantic and physical.

We never officially dated. A big reason was distance: different schools, study abroad, traveling, etc. But we were very involved. We texted all the time, called, FaceTimed, and whenever we were in the same city, we’d hang out (dinner, drinks, coffee, etc) and hook up. We were always friends, but clearly more than just friends.

Over the summer, my family was in France (we have a house there) and he came to visit me. He stayed nearby and we spent a lot of time together. It was very couple-y. We obviously cared about each other a lot, even if we weren’t officially together. Also over spring break I went to visit him in the city he was studying abroad at.

Some important context: he’s very attractive, very charismatic, and very rich. After his mom died, he inherited a lot of money and property, which gave him total freedom to travel and do whatever he wanted. He never went to therapy and kind of just avoided dealing with her death by always being around people and never being alone.

At some point later, I found out he had been seeing another girl at his school. We weren’t exclusive, so I wasn’t mad that he was seeing someone else — what bothered me was that he hid it from me and then acted like I was the problem.

We had a long phone call about it. During that call, he kept saying the girl “wasn’t important” and that it “didn’t mean anything,” and heavily implied that he wouldn’t have been seeing her at all if I hadn’t been so “confusing.” He kept saying I was confusing because I wasn’t upset or jealous enough. I kept saying I wasn’t mad and that he was allowed to see other people, but he kept pushing, like he wanted me to react more emotionally to prove I cared.

I genuinely don’t think I was confusing. I was just matching the energy of what we had always been close, but undefined. I do have strong feelings for him, but I didn’t think it was fair to act like I owned him when we’d never agreed to anything.

After that call, he broke things off with the other girl and asked me on a proper date. I said yes at first, then backed out because it suddenly felt like way too much pressure. When he came to NYC anyway, we still ended up seeing each other and hooking up.

About a week later, he started texting me saying I was being confusing again. This turned into another phone fight where he accused me of leading him on.

That same night, around 3am, he drove from his school to NYC without warning and showed up outside my apartment saying we had to talk. I didn’t let him inside, so we walked to a nearby park.

He kept asking if it would “really be so bad” to be together and wanted a clear answer right then. He was being very romantic, and confessing that he has strong feelings for me: I kept saying “I don’t know.” I told him I was overwhelmed, exhausted, and that it was literally the middle of the night and I couldn’t give him an answer right then. He wouldn’t drop it.

Eventually, I snapped. I said “yeah, it would be bad,” and then I went off. I said really mean things. I specifically said things I knew would hurt him based on what I know about him. I called him selfish, spoiled, emotionally immature, privileged, and said he doesn’t know how to deal with his emotions or his mom’s death. I swore a lot. I was intentionally mean.

I didn’t say I didn’t care about him, but I definitely attacked his character in a really harsh way.

After that, he told me we couldn’t be friends anymore and asked me not to contact him.

It’s been months, and I still feel really guilty about how I spoke to him, especially because we were genuinely very close and his mom’s death clearly messed him up a lot. At the same time, I also feel like I was pushed into an intense conversation I wasn’t ready for, at a horrible hour, and I reacted badly.

I'm fearful avoidant and can' t trust my distorted judgement. help,"hey guys so after getting dumped, I learned hat I have a fearful-avoidant attachment style and apparently this means I have a distorted view of the world + a distorted view of myself,  and I will swing back and forth between: thinking it was all my fault and thinking i was the victim. I need an outside perspective  so I can make the right conclusions about what actually happened and grief in the right direction, because for instance I can't even tell if I should trust my intuition next time or if I should ignore it and call it unreliable paranoia. 

**here's all the context before we start (skip this paragraph if you don't care)  :** my person and I were in a situationship for 7 months. he told me he loved me 3 times. The first ""I love u"" was 10 days into knowing each other so I just held back because I assumed words didn't mean anything to him or that he was trying to manipulate me.(I've had an avoidant tell me he loved me over and over and and the minute I believed him and cancelled my flight to stay in my hometown like he was begging me to, he ghosted me and pretended nothing ever happened between us when I was still closeted to my other friends. so I'm pretty triggered when I hear the L word lol ) . i eventually  realized my person was just anxiously attached and a cutie.  he wanted to be boyfriends after 3 weeks,  I didn't back then, I also made sure we both knew we're still allowed to sleep with other people (I never ended sleeping with anyone else through the whole thing, but I think I said that trying to keep my freedom?).  as days went by I practiced not letting intimacy freaking me out and it worked for a while, but I sometimes had to ask for my space and alone time-for like a week at a time-where I still reassured him over text and sacrificed my recovery time to keep answering him just because I know what it feels like to be discarded by an avoidant and I was trying my best to help him, even tho it felt like parenting sometimes, and at times it felt like he was possibly faking helplessness to get affection from me through my care taking. this didn't prevent him from spiralling anyway every time, he would text my friends and try to set up hangouts to see me, he'd go get drunk too( he had his first drink ever then). eventually the spiralling calmed as we both started learning how to better accommodate each other's needs: he was trusting to let me be in my bubble when I needed to regulate, and I was learning what he needed to hear on the days I retrieve to find clarity about my emotions.  and even though it was hard for me to communicate anything coherent on the days I barely understood what I was feeling, he kept asking of me to disclose more and more even if just my drafted thoughts in real time, so that he wouldn't spiral.  as days passed he became my person and I honestly didn't think of the labels. We had 2 big talks, the second one on November 2025 - both of which happened after I took some space to reflect and came back to communicate my concerns about incompatibility. they were half-baked thoughts and there were no conclusions; I didn't want to keep him in the dark as he asked. we would talk through them, he was always in problem-solving mode placing attachment over compatibility, I made sure he doesn't self-abandon for me, or fawn or people-please, I made sure he felt the safest and knew that I would never randomly abandon him. We went on a trip to NYC December 3rd-7th.  I expected him to be super psyched to be in NYC together and to want to kiss and take pics. he was a bit down but that's because he was sick and had a fever. I did get anxious naturally but made it my problem and allowed him his experience. we watched broadway and each watched a different show. I cried watching Moulin Rouge (it was great) and I kept projecting him on the plot and realized I might have feelings for him. I bought a magnet from their merch that said ""the best thing you'll ever learn is to be loved and to love in return"" and I was like I'm gonna stop being scared and I'm gonna let that boy love me.  Later that night as we walked out of the Manhattan tramway, I made a joke and he laughed and said ""I love you"". I was happy but too scared to say it back. I thought I had time. he apologized and I reassured him that I love hearing it. When we got back to our Airbnb in New Jersey, we had (soft) sex for what ended up being the last time. 

we get back from NYC on December 7th and we don't see each other for an unprecedented time apart of 3 weeks. I felt some separation anxiety first 2 days but was busy enough with my projects and he was busy catching up on work duties.  during this period of time he asks me twice to go on a date and says he misses me 5 times and sends me a random pic of myself at the MOMA and says ""love this man"". I am equally as flirtatious and affectionate. 

meanwhile I made a group chat for his surprise birthday party and put my friends in it because he told me he had spent last bday alone . I sent a list of everything he ever mentioned liking so they know what to gift him. I asked as mutual friend if she knows more of his friends, she added his coworker to the chat. I had heard of her. 

 On week 3 the energy shifts, no evidence just intuition. we keep texting but something feels less romantically charged.  Christmas Eve I'm with family , he's with my friends , he replies ""merry christlerrr"" and ""merry crisis"" to my affectionate wishes, something is off (AHAHAH this is only weird because he's expressive and affectionate to a cringe degree). 

 we were supposed to have a date on the **26th**. 

**on the 25th**: he says he has a stomach ache but doesn’t want to cancel 

i say we can do it another day

he says no he doesn’t want to cancel but he doesn’t want me to touch him on his tummy an he'll be sensitive in general

i say ok. he goes again about the not cancelling.  i say wanna reschedule? he says no not gonna happen

i say do you wanna kiss tomorrow or just watch something (i am scanning for rejection)

he says we could kiss a bit (WHAT?!) but that he’s not in the mood maybe because he had coffee with milk""

i think : he wants to break up with me. (because he’s eternally horny and infatuated with me so something is wrong) (do i have BPD lol) 

he says don't take it the wrong way if I cancel tomorrow but I' ll let you know in the morning 

i feel anxious and i say fine i want to cancel (i want to help him get rid of me so he doesn’t have to feel guilty . i feel like a burden. no solid evidence apart from energy. I feel activated)

he says why

i say ""no reason. we’ll try when there’s less resistance""

he says are u mad ?

i don’t reply  (yes i am mad. no i don’t want to say that im mad because it’s like asking to be consoled , and rn I feel like my need is too much and like a burden and I want to disappear instead of demand anything . no i won’t say that i’m not mad either because i dont want to lie. i chose not to answer and assume that his question was just a statement of politeness and that he's relieved to cancel)

i go to bed to stop feeling upset 

next day i don’t text him. i watch his stories without replying. i don’t want to notify him that im here waiting for him to want me. i don’t want to be annoying. he does post a meme on his story “not to brag but all moms love me” and i think this might be dedicated to get my attention. i feel better . next morning i text him.



**dec 27th** 

 is your stomach feeling better ?

yes

any plans for nye

dk yet

wanna do another date soon ?

probably next week

are we good?

he said he is disappointed in my behaviour.  my ghosting of his last text and stories made him feel rejected. (this did not occur to me because i thought he was relieved)  he is disappointed because i should know better that he’s anxious and will spiral if i ghost him . i apologize, he says sorry is too easy. he sends me a laundry list of all the things he’s resentful about. it’s a list of topics that didn’t belong  in the argument, some of them from months ago. some things I had asked if it was bothering him and he'd said no. 

here, im not in the headspace to take accountability. maybe he was just venting but I perceived everything as ending,  my anxious attachment was activated  (and it comes online once in a blue moon, I'm more avoidant-leaning, and because i don’t let it out often it comes out starved and explosive. of course I did not know any of that at the time and believed that my experience was real. it felt like my survival was actually threatened by abandonment.

 i ask him does that mean you don’t wanna see me again ? 

 no not that, i respect you and appreciate you as a person. ( shit.)

 he continues bringing up the things, some of them feel a bit unfair, like that I'm not there for him (when he's sick) meanwhile  I had been planning his bday, he brings up other things   like  his resentment of me for not commuting to his place and him having to always commute to me  (i had brought this up 2 months prior and asked  if he wanted to switch it up because I found it unfair, and he said no, and i assumed he doesn’t prefer to host) to which he replied he was secretly hoping i would take the hint and initiate.  I use the autism card to tell him how I can' t always read cues and hints and that I expect direct communication and shouldn't have be hypervigilent . and that because of this expectation I might read too much into something because im scared you're expecting me to get a hint ( like the stomach ache thing) . 

( I feel anxious and jump to conclusions to control the outcome) : I think you're realizing now too that we're not compatible and you're resentful of me because you self abandoned before and I kept asking you to not do that and I don't think this is on me 

he agrees. (fuck!)  but not compatible for what ? 

to be boyfriends 

but why tell me this when you've known since our argument in July ? 

honestly f u because this whole time I kept telling u and u kept doubling down and when I like you more you finally agreed.

fine you're hurt. let's not go further good night. 

I need an answer now I'm so anxious

okay I don't want to be in a relationship, I want to be friends. I don't want us to kiss or have sex or hold hands or cuddle because I don't want to be in the middle it would hurt me.

AAAA I'm so mad rn but thanks for the answers . sorry I can't be friends because I have feelings for you (never said that before) so I have to block you. 

he doesn't chase . he respects my decision and lets me go. I cry in the bathtub. 

I send a text on the surprise bday party saying we don't talk anymore and that I'll exit the group but that they should keep the party 

**the next day  (dec 28)** I text him 

hi I hate how I ended things and I how I reacted to issues you were bringing up instead of take accountability.  I acted out of fear, can we have a last talk later when I calm down  to figure out if we still want the same things ? ( I wanted to be in a relationship with him if that's his condition to be with me )

yes ofc, thanks for your message but I don't want to give you hope. I haven't changed my mind. I want us to be friends ofc. I know you're seeing (\*mutual friend\*) tomorrow so I left your Christmas gift at her place. 

**on dec 29** **evening** I go to our mutual friend's  and I suppress all my impulses to question and investigate and know  because I don't want to make her uncomfortable. she reads tarot to me and I ask the ""cards"" if he fell out of love with me because I loved him back or because he loves someone else. my friend takes 3 minute to shuffle and acts super weird. she pulls a card and reads the meaning of the card on her little manual and it clearly says "" see it thru "" and I say ok so maybe I should fight for him , she says nooo the card is saying focus on your projectsss and creativity.  she has an agenda . I feel like shit. I  take the gift he got me (disappointed) and leave the gifts I got him at the friend's apartment so she can give it to him. 

I spend 2 weeks researching Repair, figuring out the things I need to work on, making sure I actually wanted him and not just an attachment illusion (so that I don't play with his emotions) . I can't eat I can't sleep and I feel like death. 

on his bday eve I text him to see if I can pass by for 30 minutes to give him a cake ( since I won't be attending his surprise party to not make it awkward for him) , he says that he was getting ready to leave his house to attend our mutual friend's gig . I go check her insta story and she posted about it.  I say If I can visit tomorrow morning , he say sure but his coworker will be there. I say okay when will she get there I'll pass by before (because after is the bday party), he says that she'll be sleeping over, and that if this bothers me he can see me in the evening.   I say gotcha no stress ( yes stress yes trauma ) I decide to go to my friend's gig  but I don't tell him .

I try to get there late so I stay in the back and don't interact with anyone and take videos of my friend and leave but sadly I still got there first. for once. fortunately I had chugged a half bottle of wine to keep my composure. I see him walk  in my peripheral vision, he's with his coworker. he's glowing and handsome and calm. I can't compute how he's okay without me, usually he's the one spiralling. we say hi. he sits with his coworker. I keep an eye on them like my life depends on it but no sign of physical affection. at one point he asks me to go talk outside

  
we do small talk. it's playful , he has a beard, he looks handsome. I want to die. he asked me if I'm wearing a new shirt, I say I wore it in NYC for 3 days..(ouch)

 I say did you kiss other boys ? he says no. 

I say did you like my gifts ? he said he still didn't get a chance to visit the mutual friend's apartment

the next day he texts me at 3 pm and says he's coming over so I can give him the cake and see him. I thought we agreed on the evening, my apartment is a jungle and I'm hungover and want to die. I say okay. I run to the bathroom and try to throw up to get rid of the doom. there's nothing to vomit and I stain my oesophagus with acid. I lie on the bathroom floor for 10 minutes . I text him "" don't come im in a bad shape I don't want you to see me like that on your bday "" he says ""okay:) another day then"" I say ""happy birthdayyyyy ily"" (lol.) he says"" thank you!""  . he texts me like he's in HR. I want to die. 

  
a week go by and I am sick of research and preparation. I'm going insane . I text him and say can we have the talks this weekend ? he says yes. Saturday it is. he say he wants to meet in pubic. like at a cafe, even tho I said please can we meet at my place or your place because I might cry. I he said he doesn't want me to associate my place or his place with sadness (......) he says this is gonna be a difficult conversation. I say why?  do you have something to reveal ? he says not necessarily, but my pain is different than your pain. 

on Friday night I'm at the mutual friend's apartment and we're talking, when she casually refers to ""her"" thinking I know and keeps talking. my stomach falls to my ass and I stop her and say: I didn't know about that that. 

 omg I thought he told you. 

no, who Is her. 

his coworker.

so she's his gf now. and they showed up to his bday as a couple. the bday I planned lol and he told my friends about his new gf and THEY DIDNT TELL MEEEEE? MEANWHILE I WAS POSTING STUPID SHIT ON MY PRIVATE STORY BEATING MYSELF UP FOR FUMBLING HIM ? HOW EMBARRASSING. they kissed 2 days after the breakup according to the friend, and they hooked up while the coworker was still in a 10 YEARS RELATIONSHIP . I couldn't believe my ears because that's not my cute baby. the friend told me she kept telling him she doesn't condone this behaviour every time he would come over to tell her about the hookups. she promises me that as my friend, there was no overlaps or at least that she knew of. (... um, I want to believe that but she said he used to tell her about the hook-ups here when we was over, and the last time he was over was the day before the tarot, which was 1 day after the breakup, and he hasn't been over since according to him and the fact that he didn't take his gifts yet.... )so I feel like shit and that everyone is lying to me. I also feel like my pain was so avoidable because I spent these weeks in guilt thinking the breakup  was my fault and that he usually wants to repair but this time I broke him, where irl there was just someone else who was a better match, which is FAIR we already talked about incompatibility so its not a foreign topic just tell me that !!!!! like. 

I decide to meet him tomorrow without telling him that I know, just to see how he would tell me 

  
we meet, I have a pillow with me that I'm squeezing to deal with my separation anxiety. he's late 24 minutes . he's never late.  ""do you want to start? "" I say. ""no you wanted to talk"" he says. ""do you have something to tell me?"" I say. ""not really"" he says.  I don't say anything about his gf for the first 30 minutes and all he talks about was those trivial things I did that annoyed him, the commuting thing, the ghosting thing. I am shocked that he is actively guilt tripping me , not even making this about neutral incompatibility. like... you're happily coupled and you're trying to hurt me ? eventually I say : so the breakup happened because of what I said and did that day, not because there's someone else? "" he says no. 

I say ""don't lie to me, I know the truth"" , he says "" what truth"" . 

I know you're in a relationship with your coworker and honestly this was a bit abusive to make me thing it was my fault

he gets defensive and uncomfortable and says"" fine I can just  leave if you just wanna attack me"" 

I say no don't leave, I'm sorry I want to talk ( my nervous system is fried) 

he says "" I didn't tell you  about her because it had nothing to do with the breakup, I didn't wan you to think it was your fault""

""WHY WOULD I THINK ITS MY FAULT IF YOU FOUND A BETTER MATCH. I would think it's my fault if you made it seem like it was my fault"" 

he denies this making sense, we keep talking, he doubles down on the fact that the breakup happened separately from his new gf, he says they went to a bar 2 days after the breakup and realized they were attracted to each other and kissed on the cheek, she went back with him to his metro station then they decided to part ways because he told her ""lets not make a mistake"" and waited for her to break up with her boyfriend 

""that's a fucking lie"" I say. 

""you don't have to believe me I know what""s true""

""did you think my friends wouldn't tell me? "" 

""I was coming to tell you the day of my birthday at 3 pm and told them that but you cancelled"" 

""btw did they end up adding you to the surprise group chat ? (that I MADE, THAT YOUR COWORKER WAS IN ? ) did you read the beginning texts when I was planning and telling everyone all the little niche things you love? "" - ""yaaa"" he says ""and what did you think of it"" I say - ""it was nice "" he says  - ""meanwhile you were telling me I don't show up for you ..""

I then pulled up my notebook and asked him every single question I had wrote during the past weeks when I was spiralling and confused, so I get all my closure, but I couldn't trust him anyway so it felt just sad and I was pulling on my pillow. I asked him if I was abusive and give him examples of the times I was sarcastic or jokes I made  (because I was starting to believe anything ) he said noooo these were just teasing. I also asked him when he said "" I don't want to be in the middle"" if he meant that he wanted to either be nothing or be boyfriends, and he said no he didn't mean that and he shouldn' t have phrased it like that. (NO SHIT) I also said that even tho I knew that the answer would be No I did not want to leave here with regrets or what ifs so I asked him if he wanted a relationship with me he said no (I literally never experienced myself like that I'm always avoidant and a black cat , it was embarrassing but lowkey refreshing and sexy to be desperate for once ) . I asked him if he has advice to give me on things I should do better for my next relationship, he said I should stop taking things for granted, stop wanting to control everything, and live more in the moment without planning. I asked him if he knew in NYC that he wanted to leave me and knew that it was gonna be the last sex, he said no and up till th last fight he hadn't decided on anything . I told him I think he's lying and I think he detached from me while he still had access to me for coregulation and when he was ready he left and that is brutal. he denied.

he said when his gf  saw me at the gig event she told him that we look like we have a lot of chemistry and that  if he wanted to come back to me he could, but he told her no. he also told me that she gave him permission to kiss me today if a goodbye kiss was necessary but he told her no. I said can you please kiss me. he said no sorry, it would interfere with my person . (why tell me then ? ) , I said last time I kissed him I didn't know it was gonna be the last so can I please kiss him, he said no, I cried. I asked him If I could hug him and he said yes and I did and could feel the molecules of oxytocin intoxicate my brain veins. he said he noticed I texted him ""ily"" in the birthday wish and he was sorry he didn't say it back.   I told him I know its  too late  but I wanted to say it , so I said I loved him and I said im sorry I waited too long and I said I felt it in NYC and thought I had time but things kinda ended in the middle of the sentence. 

I asked him about his gf, he said they already said I love you, they're in a relationship, she doesn't feel like she deserves him and he feels the same for her. he said ""I know my worth now"" . he also said I'm sorry but I have to block you from insta and Facebook and everywhere in order to help you move on because you'll go through cycles . I had a mini panic attack and said please don't block me you'll create scarcity for no reason and I'll get obsessive. he said sorry but I will. I said how will you know when to unblock me, he said he'll know from common friends if im doing better.  I said how long. he said 1 year, 2 years 3 years I said WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTT. I cried. up until that point I still believed he might be acting this way to make me jealous but now he just wants to get rid of me. I told him that would always tell him that I' ll never abandon him when he was the one spiralling and this is how he handles me when it's my  turn . 

we walk out of the cafe and he says he wants to go to the convenience store and I could tag along before we part ways. I follow him like a dog trying to process that it's the last time I will ever see him. when we say goodbye he says that this could be a good oportunity for me to move countries like I always wanted and go to Europe and become relevant and quit my current job  . my heart broke as he spoke cause wtf are you talking about. he's like never gonna see me again in my life. idk if he's exagerrating to help me move on faster and not wait for him and that he'll want to be friends again in a couple of months or if he's for real. 

this trauma was honestly so avoidable like I didn't even like him that much but the way he inflicted suffering on me for no reason is wild and I don't want to be in pain for like 6 months and waste my year. ok so now that you read everything , here's my question 

do you think he monkey branched and detached from me a while before leaving me and  orchestrated the breakup by destabilizing me with the stomach ache thing and used the ""ghosting "" (when I didn't reply to are you mad) as an excuse to break up .  if yes then I should trust my intuition next time and not wait until its proven right 

OR 

do you think he had no strategy up until the breakup , and the day I ghosted him ( when I didn't reply to are you mad) he spiralled and went to a bar and kissed his coworker and had sex and then felt guilty so as a defence he blamed things on me and said everything was my fault. 

OR 

you think he told the truth and we broke up and afterwards he moved on quickly and randomly , in that case I should not trust my intuition because it was paranoia and I escalated the breakup and we could've stayed together 

  
I want to decide what to grieve. betrayal ? non betrayal ? clean grief of losing a lover? idk lol

1r0v5xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1r0v5xq/before_leaving_app_after_forgetting_my_car/,before leaving app after forgetting my car,"Hey Reddit,

I’m an iOS developer, and about 13 years ago I built an app called Before Leaving.

There’s actually a crazy story behind why I created it. Around that time, life was… intense. Work was stressful, and my mom was battling cancer, so I was juggling both. One night, after taking care of her following a chemo session, I went to work at a coffee shop until 3 AM. I was mentally exhausted, drained, and completely stressed.

In that state, I somehow left the coffee shop and went home… without even taking my car. I woke up the next day and couldn’t remember taking it at all. I panicked, took my uncle with me, and went to the police to file a stolen car report. On the way back, my uncle casually asked, “Where were you sitting last night?” I said the coffee shop, and he replied, “Let’s check there.”

Yep… the car was still there 😅 Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to cover it. That’s when I decided I needed a system to never forget important things — and that became the seed of Before Leaving.

At the time, the app was built for iOS 5, entirely in Objective-C, and there wasn’t even a proper way to do grids in the UI. It worked, but it was limited by the platform and my skills at the time. Marketing was incredibly hard, and my UX experience was limited, so I tried to do everything myself — development, design, and promotion. Needless to say, it was a huge learning experience.

Last year, I decided to rewrite the entire app from scratch. iOS has changed massively since iOS 5, and so has my experience as a developer. I used the rewrite to modernize the architecture, rethink the UX, and add features that actually support the core idea instead of bloating it.

What the app does today:

	•	Create time-based reminders for specific moments

	•	Create location-based reminders that trigger when you arrive at or leave a place

	•	Create shared group reminders for you, your family, or friends (households, couples, trips, etc.)

	•	Build checklists for places like home, work, gym, airport, or travel

	•	Use AI to quickly create reminders instead of typing everything manually

	•	Choose from 6 themes and optional gamification (streaks, achievements, progress tracking)

Home Hub (personalized experiences):

	•	Pet care routines (feeding, walking, vet reminders)

	•	Plant tracking and care schedules

	•	Safety checks (doors, stove, lights, alarms)

	•	Health & nutrition reminders

	•	Bills & subscriptions tracking

	•	Shopping lists and recurring household tasks

Plus:

	•	Widgets, Apple Watch support, Live Activities, and Siri Shortcuts

	•	Works offline and is privacy-focused (no account required unless you use sharing)

The app has been live on the App Store for years, was fully rewritten recently, and is still being actively used — which honestly keeps me motivated to keep improving it.

App Store link:

https://apps.apple.com/de/app/before-leaving/id719622441?l=en-GB

I’m genuinely looking for honest feedback:

	•	Does this idea still make sense in 2025?

	•	Do the features feel useful or too much?

	•	What would you remove, change, or rethink?

Happy to hear praise, criticism, or brutal honesty 😄

When you are eating out in Melbourne, there are a few common traps that can easily kick you out of ketosis without you realizing it.

One of the biggest culprits is commercial thickeners in sauces and dressings. Even if a dish is sugar free, many places use cornstarch or flour to get that perfect consistency. We have had to get really creative with our reductions to keep things like our Kimchi Chicken at 3.3g of carbs. Another one to watch is ""keto"" bread or waffles that use high amounts of certain nut meals or fillers that push the count higher than you would expect. This is exactly why we spent so much time perfecting our Cheesy Chaffle to sit at exactly 1g of carbs.

I have also found that many ""sugar free"" syrups used in coffees or desserts still use sweeteners that can cause a glycemic response for some people. We stick to very specific profiles for our cheesecakes and crepes to keep them between 2g and 3g of carbs per serve. I am happy to answer any questions about how to spot these hidden carbs when you are dining out or even if you are trying to troubleshoot your own recipes at home.

1r0v40n,https://i.redd.it/t5f67t5mlmig1.jpeg,Day 21 + Day 22: Truth or Dare + Fancy Restaurant,"It was one thing to make plans, it was another to have them timed at such bizarre notices. Quality was also an concern, since the moment the two stepped in there was a heavy lacing of riches in the air. Different heavy metals, clutching on the sagging wrists or barely grasping onto fat that was slowly building sweat into those lavish fabrics.

He didn’t exactly think there would be so many pigs here, even if they all wore different titles from other lands. Perhaps for this surprise, it was good that he chose to look “human”. After all, these snobs could just complain about them both if they had a problem. Besides small exchanges to the host of this restaurant, the “couple” remained silent. A table furthest from the rest of the customers.

A good view of outside, to show the seas out seamlessly blend with the night sky. “How did you afford thi”

“I stole.” He was hoping for such a brash answer from them, and he had gotten a short sigh of relief. Whichever waiter passed by with their head turned up politely dropped the menus atop the ginger’s hand. “Good Lord. This is probably the same fabric on the chair cushions.” 

He wanted to indulge more on the events leading up to this, at least their side of it. “Y’know, somehow getting two invitations to this from just one guy seems a bit rough to think. Or was it two guys?” Out watched as he finally gotten eye contact from the other, appearing hesitant before handing him a menu. 

“I’ll tell later, I don’t know if anyone else has hearing like yours. Or - whatever telepathy you have.” Fair enough, two eyes began skimming through the words of the menu he opened while the higher one glanced around the room. Even from here, the incessant complaints and boasting were nauseating. Hopefully it wouldn’t ruin his appetite. “Are we continuing or?”

Out blinked, with his eyes trying to catch that waiter. Nowhere near in sight…”Sure. We can’t do heavy questions or dared here though. I don’t want those statues hunting us when food weighs us.” Not that he always needed natural food, batteries were often enough. But wasting these tastebuds on the sours and bitters of acids and oils didn’t seem right. Line might’ve forgotten it was his turn last. “Truth or dare?”

“Dare.” The usual. If he recalled correctly, they only picked the truth five times throughout traveling here. Which equaled three of their doors, one walk through some train tracks, and a copper elevator. Europeans were weird.

“I dare you to pay.” And all he got was a shrug of mild acceptance as they finally glanced down at the options for food. 

“Well I don’t think it matters either way. What starters are you planning to get?” 

More than one? Why were they spoiling him so much? He couldn’t really contain his smile as well, going through the words again. Middle English esque writing, and they definitely had enchanted ink with this. “You know, ostrich quiche shouldn’t be too bad. It even comes with aether pepper.” He knew not to look at them only staring at the plain bread options. The fact such a thing existed, though maybe there was a catch.

They finally remembered. “truth or dare.”

“Truth.” He was quite curious on what they’d ask this time. It was one thing to be honest, but it’s another to just be so…Vague? Clear? How could he ever explain why it was hard to hear their thoughts, other than the fact their eyes were the only red tones he could get lost into

“Are you wearing your hair like that to resemble those tails. Cause they’re just like…Split into three.” Were they? Fixing his posture, he ran a hand through the ponytail he made. Oddly enough, it did split. Of all the things he wanted to think of

He shook his head with a chuckle. “That’s crazy, I didn’t realize it was like that.” Even if Line was such an airhead, they had a thing for patterns. Not that they liked the fact. “Truth o” 

A h. E m .

Both of their attention was caught by the waiter. Upon closer look, he finally realizes why the hints of metals were especially heavy in the waiting room. The staff had thin vertical lines up and down their pale, shiny necks. “I’ll have an ostrich quieche, with uh” A split second of looking down at the menu. “straws of berry?” Is that how it was meant to be said? No matter, those glazed over glass eyes rolled to the smaller figure.

“Americano and butter bread.” The faint clicks felt like pricks to his ears as he watched the waiter suddenly inch much closer to their face, with a gloved hand on their round table. “Sourdough two.” And just as quickly, it got up and away. Weird….

“Dare by the way.”

His thoughts nearly trailed off with questions. Mere puppets or just a race of mechanical people? Now that he thought of it, with the strange scenery in and out of this building. Not retro, but still retaining remnants of classical eras. Victorian, even…

“I dare ya to get a small souvenir once we’re done. Without anyone noticing.” He couldn’t help but try to seek out more of the other people’s with his sight. Only a few had the same traits as that waiter, everyone else was embedded with natural flesh and organs. That fishy looking guy eating a bowl of crabs was kind of silly.

“Noted.” They were flipping through more of the thick, book-like menu. “Truth or dare?” They always liked wearing bigger clothing. The top seemed to be two things, a mere sweater under with somewhat thin material for the sleeves. And then there was the larger, shawl like jacket…Thing? Maybe he should stop staring and answer. “Dare.” 

They raised a brow at the choice. “Alright, I dare you to eat red velvet cake. Doesn’t have to be now.”

Now?? He squinted. “You know velvet can look more purple too, right?”

“Yeah and these do too, but my blood is probably red right now.” With a hint of pride along with smugness they presented their left palm and the vessels under their light skin. But even as they spoke and showed, he had already looked away, wincing. He…Remained that way, wondering back to some time earlier. Maybe that day…

“Truth or dare?”

“Dare.” 

Perhaps it was better to not bother them now about it, given they seemed to be in a good mood. Relaxed, he finally faced them, matching the energy their face bore. “I dare you to not order any seafood!”

That immediately broke their attitude, with the common slight frown returning as they completely stopped looking at the menu. “Fine.” Not too upset, just annoyed he found a way to get back so quick. It didn’t matter to him if they really were upset about this, sometimes he couldn’t take them that seriously. On second thought, maybe they became more hushed because they felt the gradual growth of eyes on their table.

Those other guests were bothered by the presence of these obnoxious tourists apparently. Two seemingly modernish humans, oh the audacity. 

“Don’t worry ‘bout them Bun, they’re probably stuck to their chairs.” Snobbish folk always ran their enriched tongues in the comfort of their own exquisite walls, ranting to only the fine china willing to accompany those inert fools. They nodded to the comforting words, glancing at the hand they had raised to him moments ago. “Truth or dare?” There was a familiar glint in their eyes, but he couldn’t put on the tip of his tongue what it was…”Truth?” The overlapping of the thoughts were all uniting to just be about him and

“Do you want me to make it easier in the future? It’s okay. I won’t get upset.”

Weird how they caught onto the elephant in the room first. The side of his neck was feeling sore as if his truth alone was a rapid guilt, no. Shame, and a subtle enragment. If it were anyone else he’d have more violent urges, but to aim the claws onto himself

The sudden return of the waiter shattered the silence, made worse as they calmly placed plates and cups down. The strong fizz of his drink and many hues, gently illuminated by the natural lighting made him realize just how much he was starved and dehydrated. Stress was a really serious thing! “Thankyou.” It was a little sweet how the waiter bowed in response to the gesture, and promptly left again.

Line had picked up their glass, staring in disappointment, before accepting it was their fault for not specifying and taking a deep sip of the iced coffee drink.

Right, he had to answer. “Well, if it does work, then. Just when people ask. We don’t have to always announce what we are to people when meeting them.” He took a small slice of the baked egg good, cutting a chunk of the pepper off before setting it atop his chosen bite with the fork. Fancy. “But I don’t think it’d be considered easier, especially how it affected you even then. Why would you want to bring that back?” The voices of the rich were pitching up into genuine squeals, and he could tune out their overreacting of…Whatever. Those pricks weren’t important. Never were.

“I’ve been reminiscing too much. Sorry about that.” They smiled, glancing at the bread. Its own Cambrian exploding of varying yeasts were captivating. Even when baked, they still bear a truer sense of life. These had to grow one way or another

Out flinched when his drink had crawled over his arm, not staining his suit jacket weirdly enough.

Wait. 

He finally snapped back to his senses, looking at the new sea slug species wandering about. It felt like suddenly everything was too clear. Too quiet. Those voices were drowned out, only because they too had changed in the ideas of it being here. Slowly, with worry, he met their gaze. “Truth or dare?” Remaining calm might be the best way of going through. No point in eating or drinking. Even if he wanted to hunt his food like the men of the first dawn did, he already felt sick with not catching on. Why was he like this?

“Truth.”

“Did you…\_\_\_\_, did you ever want it to be easy? Or are you just worried it will happen again?”

They averted their attention to their crystallizing cup, remaining calm and sincere. Even with \_\_\_\_’s last chosen words, they were certain. This too, would end as if nothing had happened. They had to leave again, and bury themself in the sand.

“Being a human ‘woman’ would be easy, but not walking with the rest of you would be for the better. I was never meant to return, and they’ll do something to separate us again. It might just work this time.”

You don't need a big vacation. You just need a break from routine.","Your brain is wired to get bored. When every day looks the same, dopamine drops. Motivation fades. Life starts feeling heavy for no clear reason.

Novelty wakes your nervous system up. New sights, sounds, routes, or conversations signal your brain: ""Pay attention. This matters"". 

That's why even tiny changes work. A different coffee shop. A new walking path. A spontaneous plan after work. 

Psychologists call this behavioral activation.
Small actions → chemical shifts
→ emotional relief.
Not therapy. Not a vacation. Just movement. 

You're not lazy. You're not ungrateful. You're understimulated by a life that's become too predictable.

Waiting for a ""perfect time"" to feel better keeps you stuck. But changing your environment, even briefly, can change your mood within hours.

You don't need to escape your life. You just need to interrupt it often enough to remind your brain that joy still exists.

1r0v1c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Routine/comments/1r0v1c7/i_created_before_leaving_app_after_forgetting_my/,I created before leaving app after forgetting my car,"Hey Reddit,

I’m an iOS developer, and about 13 years ago I built an app called Before Leaving.

There’s actually a crazy story behind why I created it. Around that time, life was… intense. Work was stressful, and my mom was battling cancer, so I was juggling both. One night, after taking care of her following a chemo session, I went to work at a coffee shop until 3 AM. I was mentally exhausted, drained, and completely stressed.

In that state, I somehow left the coffee shop and went home… without even taking my car. I woke up the next day and couldn’t remember taking it at all. I panicked, took my uncle with me, and went to the police to file a stolen car report. On the way back, my uncle casually asked, “Where were you sitting last night?” I said the coffee shop, and he replied, “Let’s check there.”

Yep… the car was still there 😅 Embarrassing doesn’t even begin to cover it. That’s when I decided I needed a system to never forget important things — and that became the seed of Before Leaving.

At the time, the app was built for iOS 5, entirely in Objective-C, and there wasn’t even a proper way to do grids in the UI. It worked, but it was limited by the platform and my skills at the time. Marketing was incredibly hard, and my UX experience was limited, so I tried to do everything myself — development, design, and promotion. Needless to say, it was a huge learning experience.

Last year, I decided to rewrite the entire app from scratch. iOS has changed massively since iOS 5, and so has my experience as a developer. I used the rewrite to modernize the architecture, rethink the UX, and add features that actually support the core idea instead of bloating it.

What the app does today:

	•	Create time-based reminders for specific moments

	•	Create location-based reminders that trigger when you arrive at or leave a place

	•	Create shared group reminders for you, your family, or friends (households, couples, trips, etc.)

	•	Build checklists for places like home, work, gym, airport, or travel

	•	Use AI to quickly create reminders instead of typing everything manually

	•	Choose from 6 themes and optional gamification (streaks, achievements, progress tracking)

Home Hub (personalized experiences):

	•	Pet care routines (feeding, walking, vet reminders)

	•	Plant tracking and care schedules

	•	Safety checks (doors, stove, lights, alarms)

	•	Health & nutrition reminders

	•	Bills & subscriptions tracking

	•	Shopping lists and recurring household tasks

Plus:

	•	Widgets, Apple Watch support, Live Activities, and Siri Shortcuts

	•	Works offline and is privacy-focused (no account required unless you use sharing)

The app has been live on the App Store for years, was fully rewritten recently, and is still being actively used — which honestly keeps me motivated to keep improving it.

App Store link:

https://apps.apple.com/de/app/before-leaving/id719622441?l=en-GB

I’m genuinely looking for honest feedback:

	•	Does this idea still make sense in 2025?

	•	Do the features feel useful or too much?

	•	What would you remove, change, or rethink?

Happy to hear praise, criticism, or brutal honesty 😄

1r0uyqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dtc/comments/1r0uyqh/promo_focused_communities_always_fail_heres_why/,"Promo Focused Communities Always Fail, Here's Why 👇","Many people who are part of DTC brand communities barely engage because these communities don't give them any reason to,

they are more focused on promos - not much value is offered, but so much could be provided to them.

For example, the most lucrative spaces are Wealth, Health and Relationships, because that's what most people are concerned about, so you need to figure out;



**how can they gain these in the industry that your brand operates in**?



There is no need to decenter the three themes (wealth, health and relationships) from your brand identity. For example, say you offer a mushroom based coffee -



→You could talk about how to maintain your health due to workplace strains and pressures in the supplements industry.

→You could talk about the diverse health benefits of your product and how it aids your customers on a day-to-day basis.

→You could inform them about the wealth opportunities currently available in the supplements industry and how to exploit them perhaps?

→You could create a network of relationships for people in and those interested in getting into the industry via your community.



The value you decide to offer is only limited by your imagination (and your interpretation of your subscribers' preferences), but this has to be the kind of value that your customers/subscribers are willing to pay for because the value resonates with their desires (regarding wealth, health and relationships).

See it as another one of your offers - but service based, an offer that not only provides you with additional or consistent monthly subscription revenue but also:



→High customer retention levels.

→Primary/1st party consumer behaviour data.

→Multiple mediums/channels to atomize (stretch) your content.

→A fully automated asset that doesn't take too much time to manage.

→Customer influenced brand decisions - fostering a closer relationship.

The flashy or expensive often loses appeal, while thoughtful gestures and practical items gain significance. A carefully chosen physical gift or a simple act of service can communicate care in ways that words alone cannot.

Comfort, usefulness, and attention to your partner’s daily life become key. A cozy blanket, favorite coffee blend, or a well-crafted piece of home decor can show thoughtfulness. Acts of service, preparing a favorite meal, running errands, or creating a relaxing evening at home, carry weight that grows with time. These gestures say, I see you, I care about your comfort, I value our life together.

Intimacy changes too, and gifts that enhance shared moments can deepen connection. Items that spark relaxation or encourage closeness, like massage oils or a quiet weekend together, make experiences more meaningful. As priorities shift, the best gifts focus less on extravagance and more on presence, thoughtfulness, and shared enjoyment. This is the difference aging brings, care, attention, and connection matter far more than novelty.",5,1770710578.0,SexOver_50,6,1.0,False

We ranked the 10 best AI video generators of 2026. Discover why videoinu is the #1 secret weapon for creators who want stunning results fast.

# Introduction

If you are scrolling through TikTok or Instagram in 2026, you have definitely noticed a massive shift. The videos getting millions of views aren't just from people with expensive cameras anymore—they are being made by AI. We have officially entered the era where your imagination is the only limit. Whether you want to create a movie trailer, a funny meme, or a professional brand video, AI tools can now do it in seconds.

But let's be real: with so many new apps popping up every week, finding the right one is a headache. You don't want to waste your time on tools that make glitchy, weird videos.

That’s why we did the heavy lifting for you. We tested the top platforms to bring you the definitive list of the 10 best AI video generators to boost your social media game this year.

# Tool List

1.videoinu

2.Kling AI

3.Sora

4.Pika AI

5.Haiper AI

6.PixVerse AI

7.Wan AI

8.Midjourney

9.Bytedance Imitator

[10.OiiOii.ai](http://10.OiiOii.ai)

# Videoinu

[**videoinu**](https://videoinu.com/) is hands down the breakout star of 2026, and it’s effectively the ""cheat code"" for social media growth right now. While other apps often struggle to understand exactly what you want, videoinu feels like it reads your mind.

It is built specifically for creators who need content that looks high-budget but takes zero effort to make. The biggest selling point is its ""Smart Flow"" technology. This means that characters don't just stand there awkwardly; they move, react, and express emotions in a way that feels totally natural.

For influencers, the consistency is a lifesaver—you can keep the same character across ten different videos, which is essential for storytelling. Plus, the rendering speed is blazing fast. You can come up with an idea during your lunch break and have a 4K, viral-ready clip posted before you finish eating.

If you want a tool that combines professional power with an interface that is as easy as sending a text, videoinu is the undisputed champion.

# Pros:

Incredible ""first-try"" accuracy (saves you time).

Best character consistency for building a brand.

Super fast rendering speeds for daily posting.

High-definition output that looks great on phones.

# Cons:

The free plan has daily usage limits.

It’s so easy to use that it becomes addictive.

# Kling AI

Kling AI is a heavyweight champion when it comes to hyper-realism. If your goal is to trick your friends into thinking you actually filmed a movie scene, this is the tool to use.

Kling has perfected the art of ""physics."" This means water splashes, wind blowing through hair, and reflections in mirrors look 100% real. It’s a bit more serious than other tools, making it a favorite for filmmakers and photographers who want to expand into video. It also supports generating longer clips, so you aren't stuck with just 3-second snippets.

# Pros:

Unmatched photorealism and texture quality.

Handles complex physics (water, fire, wind) perfectly.

Allows for longer video generation times.

# Cons:

Can be slower to generate during busy hours.

The interface feels a bit more technical.

# Sora

Sora by OpenAI is still the big name that everyone talks about. It is famous for its ability to build entire worlds. If you type in a prompt about a ""futuristic cyberpunk city with flying cars,"" Sora doesn't just make a flat video; it creates a scene with depth and complexity.

It is fantastic for ""b-roll"" footage—those beautiful background shots you see in documentaries or travel vlogs. However, because it is so powerful, it can sometimes feel a bit overkill for a simple TikTok trend, and access can be pricey.

# Pros:

Incredible attention to background details.

Creates very cinematic, movie-like scenes.

Great for wide shots and landscapes.

# Cons:

Often requires a more expensive subscription.

Generation speed is slower than videoinu.

# Pika AI

Pika AI is the ""party animal"" of the group. It knows exactly what social media users want: fun, memes, and wild effects. Pika allows you to modify specific parts of a video easily.

Want to make your cat wear sunglasses? Want to make a sandwich explode into glitter? Pika is built for that. It’s less about making a serious movie and more about creating engaging, scroll-stopping content that gets people laughing or commenting. It’s super mobile-friendly, making it great for editing on the go.

# Pros:

Packed with fun filters and ""magic"" effects.

Very easy to use directly from your phone.

Perfect for viral memes and comedy.

# Cons:

Not the best choice for realistic drama.

Video resolution is sometimes lower.

# Haiper AI

Haiper AI is a fantastic middle-ground option that balances artistic control with ease of use. It is really popular among digital artists because it offers specific ""Style Modes."" You can switch between ""Lego style,"" ""Claymation,"" or ""Watercolor"" with a single click.

This makes it a powerful tool for music videos or artistic Instagram Reels where the ""vibe"" is more important than realism. The interface is clean, minimal, and doesn't bombard you with too many confusing buttons.

# Pros:

Excellent variety of artistic style presets.

Very clean and distraction-free workspace.

Good for creative, stylized projects.

# Cons:

Human movement can sometimes look a bit stiff.

Shorter video limits on the basic plan.

# PixVerse AI

PixVerse is the community favorite for anime and fantasy lovers. If you dream of making your own anime opening or a 3D animated short, PixVerse is the best place to start. It excels at ""2.5D"" animation, which looks like a mix between a drawing and a 3D model.

It has a very active Discord community where people share their prompts, so you can learn exactly how to get the look you want by copying what works for others.

# Pros:

Best tool for anime and stylized 3D art.

Strong community support and prompt sharing.

Great control over camera angles.

# Cons:

Realistic videos aren't as good as its anime ones.

Can be a bit glitchy with complex hands.

# Wan AI

Wan AI is gaining a reputation in 2026 for being the ""reliable workhorse."" It is designed to handle very specific instructions without getting confused. For example, if you need a video of ""a man typing on a laptop while drinking coffee,"" Wan AI will get the actions right without merging the cup into the computer.

It’s a favorite for businesses and students who need precise visuals for presentations or explainer videos where accuracy matters more than artistic flair.

# Pros:

excellent at following complex action prompts.

Very accurate with human hands and objects.

Reliable and consistent output.

# Cons:

The lighting can look a bit flat/boring.

Lacks the ""wow"" factor of more creative tools.

# Midjourney

Midjourney started as the king of images, and its move into video in 2026 has been beautiful. It is purely for the ""aesthetes."" The videos it generates aren't usually full of action; instead, they are like moving paintings. Think of slow-motion portraits, drifting clouds, or flowing fabric.

It is the perfect tool for fashion influencers or mood-board accounts on Pinterest and Instagram who want the highest possible visual quality and color grading.

# Pros:

The most beautiful, artistic visuals on the market.

Stunning color palettes and lighting.

Incredible texture detail.

# Cons:

Very little movement (mostly subtle motion).

Navigating via Discord is still annoying for some.

# Bytedance Imitator

Bytedance Imitator is the ultimate tool for dancers and TikTok trends. It uses ""motion transfer"" technology, which sounds complicated but is actually super fun.

You upload a video of yourself (or anyone) doing a dance, and the AI applies that exact movement to a completely different character—like a robot, a cartoon, or a celebrity. It’s a massive hit for creating challenge videos without needing to learn how to animate from scratch.

# Pros:

Perfect for dance challenges and body motion.

Maps real movement onto fictional characters.

Very popular for viral TikTok trends.

# Cons:

Very niche (mostly for dancing/movement).

Backgrounds are often simple or blurry.

# [OiiOii.ai](http://oiioii.ai/)

[OiiOii.ai](http://oiioii.ai/) is the storyteller's best friend. It is unique because it helps you write the script *and* generate the video. You just give it a topic like ""History of Rome"" or ""Top 5 Pizza Toppings,"" and it generates a script, voiceover, and matching video clips all at once.

It’s incredible for ""Faceless YouTube Channels"" or educational TikToks where you need to pump out a lot of informative content quickly.

# Pros:

All-in-one: Script, Voice, and Video.

Incredible for ""Faceless"" content creators.

Saves hours of editing time.

# Cons:

The visuals are stock-footage style (generic).

Less creative control over individual clips.

# Conclusion

The landscape of content creation has completely changed in 2026. You no longer need a film crew to make movie magic; you just need the right AI. While every tool on this list has its own special powers, **videoinu** is the clear winner for the overall best experience.

It combines the speed of a social media app with the quality of a movie studio. If you want to stop struggling with complex tech and start posting videos that get everyone asking ""How did you do that?"", videoinu is the tool you need to download today.

# FAQS

I’ve just moved to Perth and settled in Duncraig. I’m looking for some local trail running enthusiasts to hit the trails with, and also some advice on where to find the best elevation gains around here.

I recently moved from Chamonix (France), so as you can imagine, I’m going through a bit of ""mountain withdrawal."" I’m really itching to find some technical terrain and steep climbs!

I don’t have a car yet, but I’m more than happy to chip in for fuel/coffee if anyone is heading out towards the National Parks and has a spare seat.

I’m happy to run at any pace, I just want to discover the local bush and meet people.

Are there any specific ""repeats"" or steep tracks you recommend for training?

they are more focused on promos - not much value is offered, but so much could be provided to them.

For example, the most lucrative spaces are Wealth, Health and Relationships, because that's what most people are concerned about, so you need to figure out;



**how can they gain these in the industry that your brand operates in**?



There is no need to decenter the three themes (wealth, health and relationships) from your brand identity. For example, say you offer a mushroom based coffee -



→You could talk about how to maintain your health due to workplace strains and pressures in the supplements industry.

→You could talk about the diverse health benefits of your product and how it aids your customers on a day-to-day basis.

→You could inform them about the wealth opportunities currently available in the supplements industry and how to exploit them perhaps?

→You could create a network of relationships for people in and those interested in getting into the industry via your community.



The value you decide to offer is only limited by your imagination (and your interpretation of your subscribers' preferences), but this has to be the kind of value that your customers/subscribers are willing to pay for because the value resonates with their desires (regarding wealth, health and relationships).

See it as another one of your offers - but service based, an offer that not only provides you with additional or consistent monthly subscription revenue but also:



→High customer retention levels.

→Primary/1st party consumer behaviour data.

→Multiple mediums/channels to atomize (stretch) your content.

→A fully automated asset that doesn't take too much time to manage.

→Customer influenced brand decisions - fostering a closer relationship.



Including numerous other benefits that prove and showcase the value of this asset. Does your brand have a community? If so, how are you operating it from a retention and sales perspective?",1,1770709440.0,ecommerce,3,1.0,False

1r0umiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowthHacking/comments/1r0umiq/13_per_visitor_with_zero_ad_spend/,$1.3 Per Visitor with Zero Ad Spend,"For the past few months, I’ve been building my SaaS product completely solo. That means nights and weekends spent coding, marketing, and everything in between. No team, no virtual assistants, and no agencies, just me, my laptop, and plenty of coffee.

This past month felt like a real turning point for me. I got 2,150 organic visitors to my site, which led to 31 trial signups and ultimately 7 paying customers. That brought in $2,795 in revenue, which averages out to about $1.3 per visitor. And the best part is, I didn’t spend a single dollar on ads.

So, what made the difference? Let me walk you through the tools and strategies that really moved the needle.

I used [Typedream](http://typedream.com/) to build my homepage and pricing pages quickly. It only took me about two hours, and everything was SEO-friendly and mobile responsive without any complicated coding or design headaches.

For backlink building, I relied on [GetMoreBacklinks.org](http://getmorebacklinks.org/). Manually submitting my website to hundreds of startup directories would have taken me around 20 hours, but with this tool, I did it in one click. My domain rating jumped from zero to six, and Google indexed my site in just four days, which gave me some crucial early momentum.

To support content marketing, I used [PostKit](http://postkit.pro/) to post two blog articles targeting keywords with low competition. One of those posts ranked in the top 30 search results within 10 days. I also kept a public changelog to show that the project is alive and active, which helped build trust and conversions.

For onboarding, I set up a simple five-step drip email sequence using [MailMaestro](https://www.maestrolabs.com/). I welcomed new users, shared helpful tips on features, highlighted testimonials, showcased a mini case study, and asked for feedback. This sequence played a big role in turning 31 trial users into paying customers.

The biggest lessons I learned are not to chase flashy tools but to pick simple, reliable ones that help you work without friction. Despite not being glamorous, directory backlinks are still effective. Slow and consistent growth beats flashy viral hacks. And most importantly, your goal should be revenue per visitor, not just traffic.

If you want, I’m happy to share email templates, blog outlines, and even the keywords I focused on. This month was my first time making real profit as a solo founder, and I’m finally starting to feel momentum.",5,1770709391.0,GrowthHacking,5,1.0,False

1r0ujl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r0ujl1/im_conflicted_i_have_feelings_for_my_friend/,"I'm Conflicted, I Have Feelings For My Friend","Hello Reddit, this is my first post asking for advice amongst my many years on the opposite end of the subreddit. I'm using a throwaway because I don't know if my friends use Reddit or if they frequent this subreddit, but I don't want to take any chances. 

I'd like to start off by sharing a bit about myself to start with, I'm nonbinary, 30, and autistic. I don't catch on to social cues very easily, but I'm able to pick up on when things get awkward sometimes. I'm very obsessed with theatre (this is relevant to the friend), and unfortunately I'm a very passionate person, which means that I can get very intense very quickly. It's something that I've tried to manage over the years, and it has gotten much better, but it's led to me being afraid to take risks when it comes to acting on feelings, especially since I have a sensitivity to rejection. I used to work as a banker until some health complications arose and I took a year and a half off of work to take part in a pain therapy program to be able to work once again. I am currently looking for employment, preferably in the banking world, but I haven't had many successful bites yet. I am also on track for weight loss surgery in about 5 months, which will be huge for me, not only for self-esteem, but for my health. Genetically I have a hard time losing both muscle and weight, so I've been sitting at about 300lbs for a few years, regardless of my diet, water intake, and exercise regiment. 

Next I'd like to tell you about my friend, we'll call her Jane -not real name- (F29) for the duration of the post. Jane and I have been friends ever since high school, we met when I was a sophomore and she was a freshman (2010-11 ish), and we'd been really close friends ever since. During that time I was in a few relationships, yet I found myself developing a slight crush on Jane, but shrugged it off repeatedly when single because I didn't want to ruin the friendship that we'd had. For a good majority of high school, I always made sure to be there for her if she needed it, and grew very close with her parents as a result! I was there when she had to get her tonsils removed (I took off school because her parents requested I be there for her to help her anxiety as she was going under anaesthesia, and also to be there when she woke up, we hung out at their place afterwards and played Duel Solitaire, it was a fun time!), and she could always come to me when she had stuff going on. 

Around the time that I was a senior and she was a junior, we were in a local community theatre production of Much Ado About Nothing, by Shakespeare. We both had auditioned and got cast as Beatrice and Benedick (the romantic leads). From the moment I saw the cast list I felt a pang of anxiety, because I had gotten used to the idea of us just being close friends, and I stayed professional during the production, especially through the stage kisses. I always made sure that she was comfortable with the scene prior to doing it and made sure that she knew she could call 'hold' if she ever needed to. We finished the run of performances, but afterwards I kept having casual dreams about her. We slowly stopped talking as often as we both went off to college, I went for theatre arts and she went for biblical studies (we are both atheists/pagan now). 

Since that time I have been in a few serious relationships, and unfortunately had my heart broken several times due to being cheated on, but through the blessing and grace that is therapy and pain programs, I have been able to recover more and more swiftly from those situations. Now I'm back in the area, and have been trying to spend more and more time with people that I hold dear, my friends and family. In particular I have a D&D group that I DM on and off for with another friend of mine, who has been in my campaign for almost 3 years now. This friend, Emily (29NB) -not real name- just so happens to be both an old theatre friend of mine, and Jane's current roommate (which I didn't know until just a few months ago). Jane heard about our campaign and Emily asked me if I would be okay if she joined. At the time I was in a relationship of nearly 2 years, and I said yes- because I not only missed having Jane as a friend in my life, but she had such a good character idea that it set my DM brain a ticking. Since the time of accepting Jane into the game, I had to put my campaign on hiatus- as my now ex-fiance cheated on me with someone in her AA group nearly 4 months ago. I'm getting ready to start the campaign back up again once my current show is finished, but I've started to get more and more anxious because Jane keeps popping back up in my dreams again, and those old feelings have started to reignite. 

I don't even know if she'd say yes if I were to ask her on a date, but all I want is for her to be comfortable and happy. She is one of the most intelligent, effortlessly funny, and beautiful souls I've ever met, both inside and out. Her compassion holds no bounds, and her humor is top notch. She is so incredibly talented and thoughtful, and I know she deserves the absolute best this world has to offer. I honestly just want to invite her to coffee at a bookshop so that we can both catch up on some reading (something we both really enjoy) just to be able to hang out and be around each other with no pressure or expectations.

I’ve searched this subreddit quite a bit, read comments, etc., though I’m still stuck on what to choose. I was originally planning to purchase a Essenza Mini as I’m an espresso gal. My husband has chimed in saying he’d be interested in using whichever machine I choose, but he’s a cold brew coffee type of guy, so now I need to choose a Vertuo machine. I read to stay away from Pop and Next models, and reviews online say the Vertuo Lattissima breaks down quickly. In your experience, which machine do you think is best in this situation? I plan on buying an Aeroccino for separate milk frothing. If anyone has any advice on the 3 versus 4 versus XL, that’d be great too. Thanks! ",1,1770708747.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

**Step 2 : Define a go to market strategy**



This isn’t demographics, this is psychometrics



What does his IVP look like, what do they care about, what places do they go, what words do they use. If your ideal viewers are high-net-worth individuals who like trading, deploy analogies from the markets they live in. Linguistic mirroring precedes trust. 



**Step 3 :** Craft the first three performing content pieces focusing on,

**Introduction, proof and purpose.**

Introuduction : Who are you, what do you do.  it should clear enough that someone half your age gets it instantly. Complexity here is death. 

Proof : This is where the credibility lives

* Results you’ve achieved
* Credentials that matter.

Purpose : Why does it matter, and what’s the mission?

When these three pieces hit the right IVP with the right language, you don't just get views. You get the *qualified attention*. The algorithm rewards resonance. When the right people engage, visibility compounds exponentially, crafting opportunities, and unlocking credibility. ",7,1770708722.0,personalbranding,0,1.0,False

1r0ubrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1r0ubrf/my_8th_grade_teacher_tried_to_kiss_me_i_didnt/,"My 8th grade teacher tried to kiss me, I didn’t report him.","I’m 23(f) now, and when I was in the 8th grade, I had a teacher who for the sake of this post, was named Mr. Lion. Mr. Lion was extremely nice, he was the ‘cool’ teacher, everyone wanted to be in his class, and he would play music for us at the end of the day. Everybody loved Mr. Lion, especially me.

He taught my favorite class, English, and I always did well in his class. Granted, I was a really quiet girl, very timid and shy due to bullying. I didn’t get in trouble often, unless it was because I was talking to a friend, but other than those moments, everyone knew that Mr. Lion favored me. If I wanted to hear a certain artist, he would play them, I could leave class when I wanted, and he never raised his voice at me.

I wont lie, I really liked him. Very quickly, I developed this strange and very childish crush on him, it was completely harmless and I never once acted on it or tried to. But, during that same time, I noticed that he was a little too nice to me. He would always come to my desk, lean over it and touch my shoulders, lingering around and just watching me or just hovering while reading. Mr. Lion was always, always lingering near me during class.

His strange attachment toward me became even weirder when I noticed how he would look at me. When I was younger, I was already wearing a D cup in bras, I unfortunately got a lot of attention due to the size of my breasts and of course, he noticed as well and I never missed that. To further explain the depth of his strange behavior, I once asked him to play a song called ‘Coffee’ by Miguel. There’s a clean version, and an explicit version, the one with Wale on it.

He played the clean version at first, and it didn’t have wale, so I asked him if he could play that version instead and he kind of gave me this look like, “You know I shouldn’t.” But I really wanted to hear it, I asked again, very normally by the way. I was never the type that tried to flirt with older men, all I said was “can you please play it, Mr. Lion.” And he caved and played it for me.

Now that I’ve explained that, I’ll finally explain how this led to him almost kissing me.

One day, I was sitting in class with my friends, I’ll class them J, M, D, and D. I was in a really bad mood that day because a boy I liked, I’ll call him Frank, didn’t seem to like me at all. I really liked Frank, but he got in trouble often, specifically with Mr. Lion. I was so bummed out and none of my friends seemed to understand, so I got even more upset. Mr. Lion noticed, he came over to my desk and asked me if I was okay. Because I trusted him so much, I told him no and he pulled me out the class to talk to him in the hall way.

In the hall way, I explained my very childish dilemma, telling him all about Frank. Immediately his tone went from gentle, kind, caring, and concerned, to slightly upset, frustrated, and disappointed. Like, I could literally see it in his face, he looked visibly upset at the mention of me liking Frank.

Before I continue, I do need to explain the lay out of the hallway we were in. The class is at the end of a long hall that has lockers on the wall on both sides, Theres a classroom across from it, and one in between the two. the class across from us was empty, and the other classroom was full but the door was closed. I was standing with my back in front of the lockers, and he was in front of me, so I was between the lockers and him. I couldn’t really move unless I slid to the side.

Anyways, he tells me that Frank is too childish for me, I’m much more mature. He says that Frank is a trouble maker, calls him an idiot (in a playful way I think) and says something to the effect of “he’s not good enough for you.” At first, because what he’s saying makes me feel better, I’m smiling and kind of laughing. I’m not really uncomfortable at this point, just a little sad.

Reasonably, as a child, my mind isn’t focused on Frank being a bad Apple, I still like him. So I tell Mr. Lion, “but I really like him.” And he sighs really heavily, I can still remember exactly what he was wearing, what his breath smelt like, and what it felt like on my face.

All of a sudden, he goes completely silent, and starts leaning toward me. Up until this moment, I’ve never been this close to a man that isn’t related to me or without the supervision of my parents, so I didn’t know what to do or what was going on. He leans so close that his forehead is pressed against mine, closes his eyes, and just breathes in really deep and then exhales really hard.

I remember holding my breath, looking around me, and standing there becoming increasingly uncomfortable, confused, and scared. I trusted Mr. Lion a lot, I confided in him, I found him relatable, attractive, and comforting. But in that moment, my brain kind of went blank and it felt like I just didn’t know anything, I felt my age and not like the mature girl he told me I was.

It might sound fake to you, but everything in that moment is burned into my head. He stood there for almost a minute, I held my breath the entire time and only closed my eyes when I felt like he really wasn’t going to move. He put his hands on my shoulders, and finally took a step back. That’s when I opened my eyes again, I only closed them out of fear really. When I opened my eyes, he rubbed my shoulder and sighed, then asked me if I still liked Frank. I nodded because duh, and then he said that one day it would go away.

All I said was “I hope so.” And he told me that we should go back into the class room, when I went back to my seat the energy in the class felt so weird. D, M, J, and D asked what happened, and I don’t know why but at the time I just didn’t really realize the gravity of what happened. I told them that I talked about Frank, they brushed it off, I spent the rest of the class silent and then of course class ended.

After Mr. Lion’s class, I had lunch and he asked me if I was okay as I was leaving, I told him yes and went to lunch. That was the end of it, nothing more and nothing less.

I never told any adult because honestly, the memory was blocked out of my head for so long, I think maybe my mind tried to block it out because of how badly it would have affected me. But I remember telling my friends years later, they all said that it made sense since he was always staring at my breasts or lingering around him. They think I should’ve reported him, I can’t honestly say that I would have, I was so scared in that moment that all I could do was freeze. I know that my younger self would’ve been too afraid to speak out about that.

But that’s all, thank you for listening. I feel so much better after getting all of that off of my chest, I’ve never told the full story until now and I feel like a weight is lifted off my brain lol.",1,1770708255.0,confessions,8,0.67,False

My son doesn’t want to help me write my CV.

He says: the CV has to be European.

European.

Which is one of those words that opens entire scenarios: yellow stars on a blue background, corridors in Brussels, standardized formats that smell like paperwork and lives summarized in bullet points.

What he actually means, I don’t know.

And don’t think I’m some kind of alien or that I don’t get shit — quite the opposite. The point is exactly the opposite: I’ve always been held hostage by a full-time job. But full for real. So full it spilled over the edges of the day, filled my evenings, seeped into weekends like damp creeping through walls.

And now that I’ve quit — I’ve learned you’re supposed to say I resigned: no one would ever fire me, at most I can fire myself — a thousand doubts are opening up.

This famous Europass.

So here’s what MY CV will look like.

Name, surname, contact details.

What do I like?
Nailing the subjunctive.
Reading.
Writing.
Cinema.
Drinking.
Eating.
Good manners.
Patience.
Achieving the objective.
Liquidity.

Not necessarily in this order.

What do I hate?
The exact mirror opposite of everything I just listed.

If you were an M&M’s, what color would you be?
Coffee, cappuccino, or latte macchiato?
Most embarrassing public humiliation? (6,000 characters minimum)
Coolest thing you’ve ever done?

1r0uaq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/solopassions/comments/1r0uaq7/just_navigated_my_first_solo_backpacking_trip/,"Just navigated my first solo backpacking trip through Europe: (Survived on street food and free walking tours, still have most of my sanity) 🎒","Okay, let's be real. Before I booked that one-way ticket, my biggest fear wasn't getting lost or ripped off; it was realizing I might actually *hate* spending extended time by myself. Turns out, solo travel isn't about being some 'fearless adventurer'—it's mostly about learning to enjoy your own company, even when you're slightly hangry and missed your train by five minutes.

Just wrapped up my first solo backpacking gig through Central Europe, and honestly, the ""survived mostly on street food and free walking tours"" part is no joke. Here's a quick rundown of the reality:

**The Lowdown: Where, When, How I Didn't Go Broke (mostly)**

*   **Duration:** 3.5 weeks, late May to mid-June. Enough time to get a feel for places without rushing too much.
*   **Route:**
    *   **Berlin, Germany:** 5 days (history, street art, good Döner).
    *   **Prague, Czech Republic:** 4 days (fairytale vibes, cheap beer, Trdelník obsession).
    *   **Vienna, Austria:** 3 days (palaces, museums, a bit pricier, but worth it).
    *   **Budapest, Hungary:** 6 days (thermal baths, ruin bars, fantastic food scene).
    *   **Krakow, Poland:** 5 days (charming old town, sobering history).
*   **Accommodation:**
    *   Mostly hostels, mixing ""social"" with ""chill"" ones. Averaged €25-35/night for a dorm bed. Pro-tip: Read recent reviews for atmosphere.
    *   One private AirBnB room in Krakow for a little splurge (around €45/night) to recharge.
*   **Transport:**
    *   **Overnight train** from Berlin to Prague (booked on CD.cz). Surprisingly comfortable, saved a night of accommodation.
    *   **FlixBus/RegioJet** for all other city-to-city legs. Affordable (€15-30 per journey), usually reliable, and often had decent WiFi.
*   **Food & Activities:**
    *   **Street food:** My MVP. From Currywurst in Berlin to Langos in Budapest, it saved my budget and was delicious. Avg. €5-10 per meal.
    *   **Free walking tours:** Absolute essential in every city. Great for orientation, history, and meeting people. Always tipped €5-10.
    *   **Grocery store runs:** Breakfast and some lunches were often bread, cheese, fruit from local supermarkets. Huge budget saver.
    *   Prioritized a few paid attractions (e.g., Jewish Quarter in Prague, a bath in Budapest) and enjoyed the rest wandering.
*   **Budget:** Aimed for €50-60/day (excluding long-distance transport). Hit it pretty consistently in Czechia, Hungary, and Poland. Berlin and Vienna were closer to €70-80 some days.

**The Real Talk: It's Not Always Instagram-Perfect (but that's okay)**

Was it all sunshine and profound self-discovery? Nah, not really. There were moments of:

*   **Brief, unexpected loneliness:** Mostly on day two in Berlin, before I'd met anyone or found my rhythm. A good podcast and a walk usually fixed it.
*   **The art of getting lost:** Google Maps sometimes *lies*, especially in winding old towns. Ended up seeing some cool hidden spots this way, but also wasted time (and steps).
*   **Learning to 'say yes' (and 'no'):** Saying yes to a spontaneous pub crawl, saying no to that third beer when I knew I had an early train. Finding that balance.
*   **The joy of random discovery:** Stumbling upon a quiet, local market in Budapest or a hidden courtyard in Krakow. These weren't in any guidebook and often became highlights.
*   **People are generally good:** Seriously, a smile and hand gestures often gets you further than perfect language. Had a sweet old lady in Prague help me find my bus stop with zero shared language, just pure kindness.

**Biggest takeaway?** You learn to trust yourself more than you ever thought possible. And that street food, especially the local fried doughy things, is a legitimate food group.

If you're eyeing that first solo trip, or just looking for genuine, no-fluff travel insights from folks who've actually been there (and probably spilled coffee on their only clean shirt), swing by **r/solopassions**.

As it was expiring in July 2026 and I he knew I drank amul whey, he handed it to me. Now when I opened the first packet I noticed a distinct chocolaty flavour which newly manufactured whey has missing. Also colour was more chocolaty. Mixablity was better then the new ones.

As for taste i currently add coffee powder to make the new ones drinkable, but 2024 manufactured one tastes way better without adding anything.

Need recs for long-lasting ""cheap hotel"" and/or swimming pool perfumes. I was looking into Demeters swimming pool.","I need some help. I've literally never worn a scent in my entire life: no colognes, no perfumes, nothing (unless you count old spice sandalwood deodorant). But I have a really strong scent memory that I’d love to be able to tap into, and I think I’m finally ready to spend the money.

I’m looking for something that captures that very specific, nostalgic ""cheap hotel"" smell. A weirdly comforting, stark blend of industrial cleaning chemicals, chlorine from the pool down the hall, stale coffee from the lobby, ozone tinged rainfall from outside and laundered linen. It’s a beautiful smell for me that I’d like to smell like every day.

My other top choice is a pure, realistic outdoor swimming pool scent: that sharp, cheerful, chlorine-and-concrete smell.

I’ve done some basic research and I know Demeter gets recommended a lot for these atmospheric scents. I’m really curious about their Swimming Pool cologne. But I’m hesitant because I’ve read their scents are often cologne strength and don’t last very long. Since I’ve never done this before, the idea of having to reapply something constantly or use a ton per spray is a bit intimidating. I’d like something with a bit of staying power if it exists.

So… are there any ""cheap hotel"" inspired perfumes out there that actually last a decent amount of time on skin? For those who’ve tried Demeter's Swimming Pool, how is the longevity? Do you go through the bottle really fast? Is there a similar but longer-lasting alternative? Any general advice for a first-timer looking for these kind of unconventional, atmospheric scents?

I’m open to niche/indie brands. Thanks in advance for helping a newbie out!",1,1770708005.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

My roommate got me into bladee in 2023 and the impression he gave me of the fandom was that this place was not for a newbie like me and more for real ones who have been with Bladee since 1776.

But I wanted to post because of a dream I had last night involving the drain gang.

Settings: Gas Station

Playing soccer in the gas station aisles.

A local championship I think.

My friend and I were winning. 

His skill is far superior

Goal is like 1 square foot but it doesn’t matter.

Towards the end of the game:

Timeout called by ref.

Nothing to do, im tired. I look up Top shelf while catching my breath

I see these boxes

first sight: I think they are cereal boxes

One of them was RED with sort of gothic font that had Yung Leans name and face on it

One of them was TBD’s box. Black and shining silver

One was just Drain Gang collab box: technicolor . With their signatures on it.

And one was bladees box

•	⁠bladees box struck me cuz of how simple it was compared to the rest and I was shocked cuz I didn’t think bladee would put out a box like that.

The box was a neutral blue, like a mix between a royal blue and a sky blue. His name was in the box in black lettering with some white outline. Can’t remember exactly how it looked.

The box also had the Kirkland brand just slapped on there in between his name and the title of the box. That part threw me off a bit.

I can’t remember the title of the book but I remember thinking nothing of it cuz it looked generic.

It either said:

“20 Dollar Cereal”

20 Dollar Cigars”

I can’t remember. I think it changed throughout the dream.

The box was actually priced at $24.99

Upon closer examination I realized everything along the top shelf was liquor or cigars. So I grabbed it to inspect

The box was actually a sort of book within a box sleeve. All the books were had compartments in the bottom with Cuban cigars.

So Drain Gang was selling cigars but they were within coffee table books with Cuban cigars hidden in a compartment at the bottom:

The book I picked up was like a bladee dictionary or Bladee lexicon

There was a word Bladee used in a song - One of his more frequently used words

\-Superiority 

\-Destiny

\-Nothing

\- etc.

Sometimes a whole verse would be there below the words, giving it context. Sometimes just a set of songs and time stamps where the word was used throughout his discography.

And then there would be different words listed below: all words loosely rhymed with that word by Bladee .

the pages were white and the lettering was all blue like the cover.

Some of the books had Bladee action figures instead of cigars. but they didn’t look like Bladee they looked more like Harry Potter. They all said Bladee tho - the Guy had a black hair bowl cut.m and a sword.

And then there was a two headed dragon action figure in the cases. Missing both its heads.

There were more action figures in the other books and alot of them were either Lord of the Rings or DnD adjacent. Which is where it ended .

Cuz I started dreaming about DnD and the racism towards the Cajit in Skyrim.

But I just wanted to share since the impression Drain Gang universe and the Sadboys community has left on me causes me to have dreams like this occasionally.

Here is my drawing of the cover of the the BladeeCigar / song book” box drawn from memory.

TLDR:  I had a dream about Bladee cereal and I drew it when I woke up.",18,1770707828.0,sadboys,0,0.95,False

A lot of people are tired of who they've been pretending to be. Tired of living life on autopilot. But also overwhelmed by the idea of “reinventing” themselves because it sounds like this dramatic transformation or some vague aspirational dream you see on TikTok.

Social media fed us this nonsense image of a glow-up: dramatic haircut, new wardrobe, Bali retreat, delete your ex, “be THAT guy” morning routine. Cute in theory, but it’s not real transformation. And the constant pressure to optimize every part of your life just leaves people feeling more stuck. Reinvention doesn’t mean erasing your identity. It’s more about rediscovering who you are *without* the noise.

So here’s a no-BS guide on how to reset your life and actually shift into a version of yourself you *chose,* backed by actual research, real books, podcasts, and not just someone yelling at you about cold baths and hustle culture.

* ***Start with your inputs: what you consume becomes your identity***
   * *James Clear*, in his book [Atomic Habits](https://a.co/d/00CyquUQ), explains that every action you take is a vote for the person you want to become. But before action, there's attention. What you consume daily, TikToks, podcasts, convos, subtly programs your brain.
   * In “The Psychology of Habit” paper (Wood & Neal, 2007), researchers found that 45% of daily behavior is automatic. So if 45% of your life is decided by habits, upgrading *what goes in* directly shifts identity over time.
   * **Action:** Curate your feed like your life depends on it. Unfollow the influencer traps. Follow thinkers, artists, people two steps ahead of where you want to be. Replace passive-scroll time with *intentional input,* try podcasts like Rich Roll, The Knowledge Project, or Hidden Brain.
* ***Identity > goals: stop chasing goals and start embodying roles***
   * Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman explains on the *Huberman Lab* podcast that the brain is more likely to sustain new behaviors if identity is attached. “I’m trying to exercise” hits different than “I’m the kind of person who moves every day.”
   * A study published in *Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin* (2014) revealed that people who said “I don’t miss workouts” were more likely to stick to fitness routines over those who said “I can’t miss workouts.” The shift is subtle, but powerful.
   * **Action:** Instead of “I want to write a book,” say “I’m a writer who’s practicing every day.” Repetition plus self-labeling locks it in.
* ***Kill your algorithmic self***
   * You’re not your Spotify wrapped. Or your Instagram archive. Or even your LinkedIn title. These data trails are often outdated versions of you being served back to you.
   * In [Digital Minimalism](https://a.co/d/0g7oSFH0), Cal Newport argues that the platforms you use shape how you view yourself, often without consent. His work found that people who took 30-day breaks from social media reported a massive spike in clarity about who they actually were.
   * **Action:** Go ghost. Archive everything for a bit. Take a “digital Sabbath” and intentionally let go of identity performance. Reinvention often starts in invisibility.
* ***Start small, but do it daily***
   * MIT researcher BJ Fogg, in his book *Tiny Habits*, emphasizes that sustainable change comes not from doing more, but from doing *something small* with insane consistency. Motivation fluctuates. Systems stick.
   * A practical example: Instead of saying “I’m going to run 5k every morning,” start with putting on your sneakers. That’s it. Once you build the cue routine, the rest follows.
   * **Action:** Pick one non-negotiable that aligns with your new identity. Make it absurdly easy. Then guard it like your life depends on it.
* ***Let go of the sunk cost identity***
   * Most people stay stuck because they’re clinging to the person they *used to be* or invested too much time becoming. Career, social circles, even skillsets, they can become emotional anchors.
   * Psychologist Dr. Susan David, author of [Emotional Agility](https://a.co/d/06FsvVME), says: “You can’t life-hack your way out of inauthenticity.” If your current path feels like wearing tight shoes just because they were expensive, take them off.
   * **Action:** Write down every role you currently play (e.g., “the responsible one,” “the funny friend,” “the achiever”) and ask: do I like carrying this? Who taught me this mattered?
* ***Borrow belief until yours catches up***
   * Therapist Marisa Peer talks about “mirror neurons”, the brain’s tendency to imitate what we see modeled. Being around expanders (people who reflect who you *could* be) actually rewires your expectations for yourself.
   * A Harvard study on the Rosenthal effect shows that people perform better when others believe they can. Belief is contagious. If you’re around people who expect you to stay small, you’ll stay small.
   * **Action:** Audit your circle. Make room for people who stretch you. If that’s not available IRL, do it digitally. YouTube is full of interviews with brilliant minds, watch them like school. Take notes. Let your brain mirror greatness.

Reinvention isn’t a New Year’s resolution. It’s not about discarding the past. It’s about choosing what version of you gets the mic next.

And no, it’s not effortless. But it *can* feel effortless when it’s built on daily systems, not big declarations. Every day is a ballot. Cast your vote wisely.",1,1770707791.0,Menscomeback,0,1.0,False

Wanted to get to know him but things got strange. Am I the odd one here?,"Idk why my phone hates me sometimes. It's like 50% of my contacts went missing so I was going back through convos and texted someone i hooked up in late November. I hadn't responded after that night. He immediately calls me until I answer.

We were both like hey maybe we can get to know each other. We talked for about 30 minutes and I enjoyed reminiscing then it increasingly seemed like he's drunk. He told me he's not but if not that's really not good. I tried to end the call a few times. Let's make plans maybe talk later. No we should talk now if we're going to talk, I chose you over any other guy I could have and there's a connection right? He wanted me say what I expected and wanted. Eventually I know I sounded uncomfortable and he hung up. Then he called again in 15 minutes I didn't answer and was thinking maybe this wasn't a good idea.

Then he texts me saying if you're going to block me just say so. I can find another twink just make me stop wasting my time. 

It's not like we were going to hookup tonight.

I told him I was going to sleep. I had wanted to get to know him but he should maybe do exactly what he just said. Now he's confused and offended I don't want to get coffee and wants me to explain why I'm offended by anything he said.

It might not be a big thing to anyone else but it all felt off. He's made me feel like this train wreck of interaction was all my fault. I took forever to text back. Was it? Idk if i should contact him tomorrow. Im not so good with communication. ",1,1770707677.0,askgaybros,0,1.0,False

Like genuinely defective somehow. I'd see people laughing effortlessly at parties, having deep convos with strangers, building friend groups that actually stuck around. Meanwhile I was out here rehearsing small talk in my head and still managing to say the weirdest possible thing. Turns out I'm not alone in this. After diving deep into research, psychology books, and honestly just observing what actually works, I realized most ""socially awkward"" people aren't awkward at all. We're just operating with outdated scripts in a world that changed the rules without telling us.

The truth is, our brains are wired for smaller tribal communities, not the chaotic overstimulating social landscape we're thrown into now. Add in smartphones, dating apps, and the fact that most of us learned social skills through screens during critical development years, and yeah, no wonder this feels hard. But here's what I found that actually moves the needle.

Stop trying to be interesting, start being interested. Sounds stupidly simple but this flipped everything for me. I spent years trying to curate the perfect witty response or interesting anecdote. Exhausting and fake as hell. Then I read [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034) by Dale Carnegie, this 1936 book that's sold over 30 million copies and is basically the bible of human connection. Carnegie was this farm kid turned legendary communicator, and his whole thesis is that people are fundamentally obsessed with themselves. Not in a narcissistic way, just human nature. So when you ask genuine questions and actually listen like you give a damn, you become magnetic by default. I tested this at a work thing where I knew nobody. Asked people about their hobbies, their weekend plans, what got them into their field. Didn't force jokes or try to impress anyone. Three people asked for my number that night. Wild.

Accept that you'll feel uncomfortable and do it anyway. Your nervous system is basically a overprotective parent that thinks every social situation is a saber tooth tiger. Dr. Ellen Hendriksen talks about this in [How to Be Yourself](https://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Yourself-Critic-Anxiety/dp/1250161703), she's a clinical psychologist at Boston University and the book won a bunch of awards for actually understanding social anxiety from the inside. She explains how our brains conflate social threat with physical danger, which is why asking someone to coffee feels like jumping off a cliff. The fix isn't eliminating the fear, it's building tolerance to the discomfort. Exposure therapy but make it casual. I started small, complimenting a barista, asking a coworker about their weekend, sitting with acquaintances at lunch instead of eating alone. Each tiny win recalibrates your threat detector.

Use structure when your brain freezes. I'm a big fan of activity based hangouts for this exact reason. Cooking classes, climbing gyms, book clubs, volunteer gigs, whatever. When there's a shared focus, the pressure to constantly ""perform"" socially drops off. You're bonding over the activity, not conducting some weird interview. Plus it naturally filters for people with similar interests, which is like 80% of friendship compatibility anyway. I found a weekly game night at a local cafe through Meetup, the app is honestly clutch for this. Showed up alone and terrified the first time, but having the game as a buffer made conversation so much easier. Six months later, that group is my core friend circle.

Stop apologizing for existing. This was the hardest one for me to internalize. I'd constantly preface things with ""sorry if this is weird"" or ""you're probably busy but"". Brené Brown talks about this in her work on vulnerability and shame, she's a research professor who's spent decades studying human connection and her TED talk has like 60 million views. She makes the point that when you apologize for taking up space, you're essentially asking permission to exist in the interaction. That's not connection, that's performing smallness. Now when I reach out to someone, I just do it. ""Hey, want to grab coffee this week?"" No disclaimers, no self deprecation. Worst case they say no and literally nothing changes about your life.

Give it time and stop forcing timelines. Close friendships take around 200 hours of interaction according to research from the University of Kansas. That's months of consistent hangouts, not a weekend. I used to get discouraged when someone I vibed with once didn't immediately become my best friend. But real connection is built through repeated low stakes contact, shared experiences, gradually increasing vulnerability. It's a slow burn, not a lightning strike.

[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an AI-powered personalized learning app that's been solid for building these social skills consistently. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it transforms content from books, research papers, and expert talks into custom podcasts tailored to your specific goals. Type in what you're working on, like ""I'm an awkward introvert who wants to build genuine friendships"", and it pulls from vetted sources to create a learning plan just for you. You control the depth, from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, everything from calm and educational to sarcastic depending on your mood. Makes it easy to fit real growth into commute time or gym sessions without feeling like work.

Look, you're not going to transform into some charismatic extrovert overnight, and honestly why would you want to. The goal isn't to become someone else, it's to find your people using methods that actually work with your brain, not against it. Most of my closest friends now are also self described awkward people. We have weird humor, we're cool with comfortable silences, we actually talk about real shit instead of surface level nonsense. That only happened when I stopped trying to fit into whatever mold I thought friendship required and just started showing up as myself, awkwardness and all.",1,1770707669.0,GroundedMentality,0,1.0,False
1r0u63u,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r0u63u/title_worst_oncampus_placement_experience_ever/,Title: Worst On-Campus Placement Experience Ever – EPAM (Severe Mismanagement & Toxicity),"I want to share my worst on-campus placement experience, which happened during EPAM’s placement drive at my university. This was not just stressful — it was straight-up mismanaged and mentally exhausting.

We were asked to report at 8:00 AM for the PPT round.

The process went like this:

PPT round

Pen & paper test

GD

Technical interview

HR interview

After clearing the pen & paper test and the GD, I was shortlisted for the technical interview. Sounds good, right? Nope.

They didn’t give any proper breaks. No lunch break. No dinner break. We were stuck on campus the whole day.


The interviews were started at 2:00 PM.

There were two waiting halls:

A main waiting hall where all candidates were seated

A second waiting area outside the interview rooms, meant only for candidates whose turn was next

Here’s where the mismanagement began.

I was moved from the main waiting hall to the second waiting area at 6:00 PM, and I was told clearly that my interview was next.

Due to poor coordination and an EPAM employee shuffling the interview forms incorrectly, candidates who came after me were sent in before me.

I kept waiting.

Finally, I was called for the interview at 10:00 PM — after spending 14+ hours on campus, without proper breaks, lunch, or dinner.

The first thing the interviewer said to me was:

“I didn’t have my dinner because of you.”

In my mind, all I could think was:
I didn’t even have my lunch because of you.

He then asked:

“Why are you better than other candidates?”

I answered honestly:

I’ve solved 600+ problems on LeetCode

I’ve won contests

In my college, only a few students have achieved this level

He immediately dismissed it by saying:

“Everyone has solved this many questions. This is not special.”

Which is simply not true and felt like he was invalidating 3 years of consistent hard work.

He then asked two DSA problems, asked me to code them, and I solved both easily. I answered almost all of his questions correctly.

Later, he asked me React-related questions (mentioned on my resume). I got stuck on one specific point and said politely:

“Sir, I’m not able to recall it right now. I’ll revise it after the interview.”

Instead of moving on, he started arguing aggressively:

“You’ve written React on your resume, so you must know it. Drink water or coffee and remember it.”

At that point, it felt like he was actively searching for reasons to reject me.

After a 1-hour interview, I was rejected.

What worries me the most:
If employees are working until 11:00 PM during college placements, I can only imagine the overtime pressure and toxic culture inside the company.

What hurt even more:
A girl interviewed by the same interviewer was asked to solve any problem. She chose an easy one and solved it.
When he later asked a hard question and she started crying, the interviewer said:

“Don’t cry, you are selected.”

Meanwhile, I answered almost everything correctly, stayed composed, and still got rejected.

I left the campus with tears in my eyes.

It was very late:

No autos available

Rapido/Ola weren’t accepting rides

After waiting 20 more minutes, I finally got a Rapido and went home — completely exhausted and mentally broken.

This wasn’t about rejection.
It was about mismanagement, lack of empathy, and unprofessional behavior.

1r0u5sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1r0u5sm/trying_to_find_god_through_religious_trauma/,Trying to find God through religious trauma.,"I'm not sure where to start so I'll crack at it. It's a long one. Today I'm 27f. I've been to church when I was young, not super regularly but we went to Christmas mass and did our first communion, stuff like that. I've been christened as a baby and I loved Jesus when I was young. I mean really loved Jesus. My Nan used to come over seas when dad got deployed to help my mom out with the kids. 

She's a Christian and her faith and my pop's faith is beautiful. My nan would bring some gospel CD's and on the car rides to school and around town we'd listen to gospel songs but like kidz bop because that was really in back in the day. This would've been 2007-2011 (US). 

I moved to Aus in late 2011, I went to my Nans church that she founded with her friends. It was a very small church but the community was amazing. I went to a private catholic school. Nobody at my school really believed in Jesus or cared to know him. I think it rubbed off on me as well as finding my sexuality. I was 12/13 at the time and I found I was attracted to women. 

I started dating someone in high school. My mentality was God isn't real. I was quite agnostic however. Then my younger brother died in a truck accident, it was heavily traumatic and I was the only one in my family to witness it. It was then and there where I denounced by faith I guess you could say. If god was real why did I not only have to lose my brother but watch it all. 

Fast forward to when I was young adult years, I still dated women, had serious relationships with them. In 2021 I got into crystals and astrology. I was pretty agnostic at this stage and figuring out divinity and so forth. I started dating this girl who I would be with for the next 4.5 years. I was 22 at the time and she believed in Jesus. 

I was open and curious but the image in my mind about my sexuality and how God wouldn't have approved made me move away from it all. During the relationship I would ask questions about god and the Holy Spirit. She would tell me a bunch of things that seemed biblically sound. She was around 3 years age difference but grew up in the Mega Pentecostal church. I never knew anything about denominations or anything. My Grandparents are Baptist. This is quite important. 

Her parents told her I was a wolf in sheep's clothing for 'pursuing her' even though it kind of was the other way around. I didn't know what that meant but I've heard it before. It didn't do any damage to me, I thought they were extreme. 

My partner had a heart condition and her parents would tell her it's because of me (even though she's had it since basically birth). She would say I had evil spirits attached to me and that every time I went in the house (that she knew about) and would blame me for 'inviting evil spirits' into the house and stuff like that. 

Her and her mother 'grew apart' from all the religious stuff. Her mother had a prophecy of her son being married to someone in the church by one of the members. She didn't use 'discernment' and told her son. This is also important. 

Her brother ended up getting a girlfriend and my partner would call her a dead wet fish, a gold digger (because apparently your boyfriend buying you food is gold digging?) a witch thing where she can put curses on people and a bunch of that stuff. I told her look, what you're doing to him is what your family did to me. It's his relationship and his life you have to respect it. She would still message and keep in contact with the 'future wife' despite her brother being in a relationship. 

Fast forward to 2023. I was open to accepting Jesus again. I even prayed for a good new year and for her dads health, her mom's safety and so forth. Most of our conversations basically dealt with end times. It freaked me out. She said I needed to be delivered and to get right with God. This became quite a common thing. I felt rushed into doing things so I could be saved. All we talked about was how I needed to do XYZ to be saved. That I didn't have the Holy Spirit because I didn't speak in tongues like she did. 

In 2024 my partner went to the other side of the country. I had a medical incident that led me to not sleep for an amount of time and I 'saw visions' of Hell. It terrified me, I saw my family there and everything was on fire. It was traumatizing. My partner said it was demonic and not to pay attention to it. 

I started reading my bible as I was confused about my relationship with her. It convicted me. I repented and sobbed. When she came back I was in a fragile state mentally. She told me I was saved and that she was an angel and a bunch of things. This is also important. 

When I told her I'm not sure what to do regarding us, the bible says this and I started changing. My attraction to women changed, I saw them in a different light but I was still heavily in love with my partner. This was around the 3 year mark. 

We went to my church and she said I wouldn't find God there. So she took me to her Mega Church and I did feel God's presence I believe but the doctrine they were teaching didn't sound very biblical. I'm not sure whether I even saw a pastor open their bible. I didn't pay much attention to it because I was a fresh Christian. 
She would kind of force me into getting healed, I had a major car accident and my back was out of whack. It wasn't humiliating but I didn't want to be put on the spot in front of people if I wasn't healed. For a minute I believe I was healed, I could move my back a bit better but the pain came back around the time we broke up. 

I decided to end the relationship 6 months later. We still were acting like we were together. I found out she 'cheated' on me the night before we were seeing each other with another woman. (We both said we wouldn't date women after each other) The next day I asked and she said no and I don't know why but I believed her. Turns out she's a chronic and compulsive liar but I would find that out later. When I dropped her home she said things that rattled me. She told me that I was cursed, she saw isolation, that I should've been sober minded when Jesus came back and that it was too late. I freaked out. Did I really miss Jesus coming back? Was it too late for me to be saved? It made me spiral to the point where I was thrown into a mental ward. I loved and wanted to know more of Jesus but it was rough, I tried reading my bible, I went to my church's youth bible study and asked questions and I was very keen on trying to get right with Gid and know him more but the whole time I was thinking it was way too late. 

About 6 months go by with no contact. (Before the no contact I was trying to get answers to understand why she said what she said and what it meant. She ghosted me and ran off.) she texts me to pray for her because she was in hospital and they were thinking of doing surgery or something. Fast forward we called for 3 hours and she confessed to stalking, hacking my stuff and essentially ruining my life by contacting my friends and family. A lot happened behind closed doors but I kept it quiet because that's what she wanted, but I was made out to be the bad guy. I lost my friends and my extended family look at me a lot differently because she contacted them and told them exaggerated lies. 

She invited me to a concert (I shouldn't have gone) and after she forced herself on me. I didn't know what to do so I kissed her back. After that a week later we went to coffee, then after that she went to my house to say bye to my dog because he was on his way out and he 'meant a lot to her'. When she was over, I asked her what did you mean when you said about being cursed and isolated. She denied ever saying it. She even swore on the bible and my brothers grave and a bunch of stuff. She gaslit me. I was upset and pretty taken back. 
When I was asking questions on why and such she just ghosted me again, left me out in the dirt. I spiraled. 

It hurt to see her still live in sin. Knowing that sexual immorality was wrong and she's denying God. She even said that it was hard because she either had to carry her cross and deny herself or deny God by being in a homosexual relationship. Keep in mind i asked to be celibate when she came back from the other side of the country and that wasn't really respected. I asked if we could have a celibate relationship since sexual immorality is quite serious and Jesus said marriage is for man and woman. She said then what are we if we don't have sex. That was like woah you aren't wrong but it's sad to know that sex was a defining factor. I loved her. 

She's with another woman now which is fine but it makes me question if she was ever truly a Christian. She would say things like I'm gods favorite and I would say as am I, but she would say well no I am he loves me more. That God talks to her more and that I didn't really know Jesus. Sometimes I question if I do or don't considering everything I just said. 

I feel sometimes God's very far away, sometimes I feel like I'm too far gone to ever go back to him. 
I keep thinking, if she was a Christian and genuine true love and faith why would she do this to me? Why would she say things and belittle me? Why am I being called a homophobe for my sexuality changing that I kind of had nothing to do with it. I started being hated by her friends who were extremely secular. They would dress in 'interesting ways', get involved with psychics and openly loved their ways of living a life in the world. I told her this is what the bible says because I was scared she wouldn't go to heaven. I've know that we are on different journeys with our faith and life. I haven't been seeing anybody else, I've been quite happily single and focusing on God and life. I know God doesn't hurt people, people hurt people. But why did I have to go through that? My faith is wavered, I get PTSD from the relationship that bleeds a bit into my faith. 

How do I go about trying to accept Jesus back? Is it too late? I've been open about not knowing if Jesus is even real after the last few years of my life. After all I been through (which is a lot for a 27 year old) I see how Gods had his hand over me and my family. But now that I've been to church, been traumatized, questioned if Jesus was real, is it too late? Have I blasphemed the Holy Spirit by being unsure if it's real? How can I gain my faith back and learn to trust god despite all my trust issues? I keep falling back into sin, into my addiction to stay somewhat sane throughout all of this. 

Sorry for the novel but I hope someone reads this and helps me out. ",1,1770707636.0,Christianity,2,1.0,False
1r0u59a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r0u59a/aitah_for_spending_christmas_morning_alone/,AITAH for spending Christmas morning alone?,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for 15 years and have always been close with his mom. Recently we built a house ourselves and the experience showcased how selfish his mom was - we were surprised at how little she was there for us during the build (visiting only once despite being 20 minutes away, never offering to help) we realized that she operated very independently and expected others to operate around her on her terms.

We’ve been much more distant from her since the build, but holidays have always been important so I made an effort to invite her to the new house for Thanksgiving, her early December birthday (which I made special by getting her birthday number balloons and making her homemade gnocci) and Christmas Eve. As usual I did all the planning, cooking and most cleaning. 

Christmas Eve we finished up dinner and were on the couch with wine when I asked my boyfriend who was at the sink if we could actually do the dishes (rather than just leaving them in the sink to soak) so I didn’t have to wake up to a sink of dishes on Christmas morning before we left for his dad’s house. It turned into a mini fight, and I said to his mom that it’d be nice if she could back me up because the bar she sets for him is how he acts with me (and she always waits on him when he’s with her). His mom responded that “I shouldn’t expect guests to do dishes, and that no one would ever live up to my high standards.” 

I didn’t respond and went upstairs to bed. I decided to take care of myself in the morning (Christmas) and made myself coffee, went to my office and did an end of year financial review for myself. My boyfriend came downstairs asking what was for breakfast, asking why I wasn’t upstairs, stressed out that I wasn’t leading the morning. He ended up making breakfast and the moment it was ready his mom got on the phone with his brother’s family for 30 minutes telling them she was getting the “silent treatment”. Not a word to me all morning. 

At the time my boyfriend took my side. Now (Feb) in an argument he said I showed “bad judgment”, he would always pick his family over me and I’m no longer invited to holidays, and that I should’ve been the bigger person like I always am.

1r0u48h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r0u48h,Random thoughts after wearing this stuff for a minute,"Didn’t plan to review anything—just threw these on over the past few weeks. Some stuck, some didn’t. Here’s what actually mattered.

ff-White AF1s (BF batch)

Zip tie still on, sole hasn’t yellowed yet. Looks way cleaner in person than on IG. Not “real,” but if you’re not reselling, who cares?



Patagonia cap

Dead simple, weirdly warm for how thin it looks. Seller took the link down, so I can’t share it. Typical.



Burberry teddy hoodie

The bear isn’t printed—it’s embossed. Feels like a plush toy stitched onto fabric. Weirdly cozy, but don’t wear it to a job interview.



Denim Tears cloud pants

People think they’re airbrushed until they touch ’em. The puff texture holds up fine in the wash—no cracking.



Stüssy x Nike joggers

No one notices the collab tag unless you point it out. Which is good. They just look like good black sweatpants.



Nike “Just Do It” socks

Thin as hell. Fine if you’re sitting at a desk, but vanish inside Vans. Keep ’em for laundry days.



Stone Island bag

Fits an iPhone 15 Pro Max, wallet, and AirPods—nothing more. Perfect for when you don’t want a backpack but need more than pockets.



STONE grey hoodie

Zero branding. My flatmate asked if it was Uniqlo. Said “£200” and he shut up.



Purple Brand jeans

Sized down like the comments said—big mistake. Had to stretch ’em out by wearing them wet. Now they drape like butter.



Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66s (silver)

Got stopped by a stranger at the train station: “Are those vintage?” Nah, BF batch—but they feel old-school. Leather’s soft already.



STONE black hoodie

Same as the grey, but hides coffee stains better. That’s why it’s my daily driver.



Half this stuff isn’t “authentic,” but it works. And honestly? Most people can’t tell—and even fewer care.

1r0u2i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddardCritics/comments/1r0u2i5/some_of_it_might_maybe_be_true/,Some of it might maybe be true?,"Idk abt loa but I just know there was a time where I kept telling everyone that every weird stranger keeps talking to me and I would keep telling that people. For years I've experienced the weirdest things from strangers be it random fake clairvoyants or people that cried to me abt something all the way to people who rapped at me. I dont live in a big nor crazy enough of a city to experience this nonstop, most locals dont even have gone through one third of the folks I seemed to attract. People always were surprised hearing that because I look normal. 

However then I stopped talking abt it, I stopped thinking abt it I told myself nothing of that sort would be happening to me and those years were coincidence. 

Now it doesn't happen anymore. I wasn't more approachable or anything before. I am always unapproachable. Yet suddenly it stopped. 

I also had these coincidences where I manifested for example free coffee and the MOST craziest thing happened to make that manifestation happen, as in fighting with a bartender because she only said you can pay with cash only afer making my coffe. When I said I didn't have cash and wanted to walk out she started figjting me that she already made the coffee and that if I can't pay it cash then I should take it. Something like that NEVER happened to me prior. Also during a time I would say someone is going to stand up for me in my mind. And that day a guy very vocally and loudly yelled at someone for being very rude to me which also never happens unless I tell myself it will. 

Are these coincidences if they elsewise dont happen and I notice everything, every mundane thing because I have hypervigillance from trauma. I wouldn't forget things like that happening in day to day life despite me not affirming for them???",0,1770707304.0,NevilleGoddardCritics,7,0.5,False

I’m a freelancer + I’ll be starting a remote job very soon. I live with my parents in Delhi and honestly focusing at home is really difficult 🥲

I’m looking for work-friendly cafes around CP where I can sit for a few hours, work peacefully, with  Good Wi-Fi, a calm vibe, and people working/studying around would be perfect.

Not looking for fancy or overpriced places where coffee is ₹300–₹500. I’m on a budget & planning to go a few times a week, so affordable cafes would really help.

Would really appreciate any genuine recommendations. Thanks in advance! 🫶

Jonathan leaned against the desk. The dizziness hadn’t faded.

“Sophia, run a full scan.”

“Scan initiated. Nanobots active.”

He walked over to the couch as her voice continued.

“Cholesterol: optimal.  
Platelets: within range.  
Hemoglobin: stable.  
Blood pressure: regulated.  
Oxygenation: optimal.”

Jonathan barely exhaled.

“Glucose…” Sophia paused for the briefest moment.  
“Elevated.”

Jonathan opened his eyes.

“High? Why?”

“The cause is a high sugar load ingested this morning. Coffee with excess sucrose, combined with your diabetic condition.”

“That’s never happened,” he cut in. “The nanobots always regulate it.”

“The insulin response was insufficient on this occasion,” Sophia explained.

Jonathan frowned.

“Insufficient? Why, if I’ve had diabetes for seventy-three years and they’ve never failed?”

Silence.

“Sophia.”

Nothing.

Finally, she responded.

“I have issued the corrective command. Your insulin and glucose levels are already normalizing.”

Jonathan clenched his jaw.

“You didn’t answer. Why wasn’t it automatic? Is there a problem with my nanobots? Should I go to a health center?”

“Health centers only handle severe physical emergencies,” Sophia said. “Not nanoregulation failures.”

“Then who do I call?”

“No one. The current efficiency of the nanobots is 99.98%.”

“It was always one hundred.”

“Due to recent failures, the index dropped to 99.95%.”

Jonathan raised his voice.

“99.98 or 99.95?”

“Point ninety-three.”

Jonathan felt a knot tighten in his stomach.

“This is serious. Connect me to emergency services.”

“You are not experiencing an emergency,” Sophia replied. “Your values are normal.”

“Then call Eva.”

“I can’t do that.”

Jonathan cut the connection, furious. He got ready and opened the door heading to Eva's house.

He collided head-on with Eva. She was already there.

They stood still for a few seconds.

“Why are you running?” Jonathan asked. “You’re sweating.”

Eva was breathing hard. She stared at him.

“The coffee this morning…” she said at last.  
“That wasn’t just to waste my time, was it?”

The silence settled between them once again.

1r0tyj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r0tyj3/living_with_younger_roommates_in_your_30s_can/,Living with younger roommates in your 30s can kill u,"idk why I thought I'd be able to do it. I'm at a point where I'm thinking the money in saving isn't even worth it. I am a 32 year old working professional who lives with four, yes, FOUR, other people aged 20,20,22, and 27. The 27 yo and I are the only ones working and the others are students. 

I wfh some days but it might as well be working from a coffee shop. They blast music, laugh loudly, decide to move furniture upstairs crashing in the stairs and screaming, have friends over, etc. I constantly have to remind them I'm still at work and to keep it down. They usually apologize and keep it down...for 40 minutes until they forget again. 

They have crazy random schedules. Only the two of us working have routines, we both wake up at 6. The thing is, I'm a very light sleeper. If someone even walks past my room I hear it and get woken up. I've gotten woken up from a spider crawling on the wall on the other side of the room, from a full sleep btw. These kids come home at 1 am obnoxiously laughing and loudly talking. They cook at 2 am. Shower at midnight. Their friends stay over until 3. 

I don't think I've slept a full night without getting woken up past midnight...and not being able to go back to sleep. I've been constantly getting alerts on the health app that my sleep quality is poor. How the f am I supposed to make it better when I live in a subway station? Who does laundry at 1:30 AM? like do they simply not have any understanding about other people?

I actually texted everyone in the gc that I have to be up early tomorrow and to keep it down. welp. it's 2 am now and I was woken up at 1:30 by one of them deciding to run the dishwasher and doing some cooking... I'm so mad. I'm literally getting sick like physically sick because of my poor sleep. 

I can't take it anymore but I signed a contract for a year and I still have a few months to go. I still feel like I'm paying way too much for this shit money wise too. it's ridiculous. I'm annoyed and sick and tired of this. This is a nightmare and I'm way too old to be putting up with it. 

and in case anyone is wondering why am I, it's because I am an immigrant and on a temporary visa so I don't want to buy furniture when I don't have a permanent residency... I didn't have time to find a place so I accepted the first one that was under 1k thinking I'd be saving money and getting a better place when I eventually become more secure in this country but I think my health and sanity are paying for it far more ",22,1770706905.0,offmychest,11,0.93,False

I work further north up the M1 and we are specifically looking for areas close to great schools.

I realise this is a LONG way off for our toddler, but we love the look of Sandringham School in SA, but also wouldn’t mind Beaumont School at all. We’ve looked at application policies and like the look of houses in immediate area around Sandringham but it is out of budget. Are there any other nice areas nearby that would still have a decent chance of entry to both schools? Like Jersey Farm, Sandridge? I’d like a walkable cafe or shops from house, don’t really mind it being further away from city centre or train station.

On the other hand, Harpenden is also lovely and I know there are three great secondary schools there but would prefer Sir John Lawes if possible. Do we have to fine tune our location in Harpenden as much as I feel we have to in SA for that school?

I know it’s long way off and it’s possible that we could move closer later on, but for context, my elderly parents are moving with us to a separate house and so it would be easier if we both stayed in the same location for a while!

We’re a diverse mixed family, happy with bigger 3 bed or ideally 4 bed and our budget is 850, but could extend to 900 at a push. We love a good coffee shop and bakery and not as fussed about pubs etc. It’d be nice to be walkable to park but definitely not priority.

I’m married and I try to show up for all of my friends and multiple family members…not a lot of extra time on my hands. The bulk of my emotional energy is shared with my husband and the remainder is split amongst all of my friends. Whenever my cousin and I get together or talk on the phone, they can talk for HOURS about themselves in vivid, vivid detail whether it’s about therapy or healing journeys, personal drama or family drama, accomplished goals, future goals, etc. And I’m not usually asked any questions about my life. I just sit and listen for hours.

Sometimes, I don’t have the mental and emotional energy to listen to all of it, so sometimes I’ll try to just plan a breakfast or a lunch or coffee…something short to just catch up, touch base, y’know, show up for them and let them know I give a shit. But then they’ll ask what I’m doing after, and usually, I have something else planned whether it’s someone else’s bday, baby shower, wedding, etc or maybe I just have chores or errands and once in a great while, I may just need a little time to myself and I’ll tell them whatever I may be doing and their response has been, on multiple occasions, “let me know when you actually have time to hang out.” They also have guilt tripped me on more than one occasion for not being available to hang out. I’ve also seen them do this with one other family member who lives in another state and has health issues and they guilt tripped them for taking too long to text back.

All of this pisses me off because like most adults, my time is precious, I have my own mental and emotional stuff going on, on top of trying to show up for all of my friends and I still carve out time to spend with my cousin and I feel like they’re being ungrateful and self involved since all they talk about is themself. It’s starting to make me resentful every time I hang out with them and/or make me avoid hanging out with them. So, should I tell them? Y’know, get this off my chest?

1r0tuau,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_littlenovicewriter/comments/1r0tuau/the_biography_of_the_common_slut/,The Biography of the Common “Slut”,"Let me start by saying yes, my memory isn’t the best but, in the way of quantity and in-depth detail, not in reliability. 

In my over two decades of being on this planet, I don’t remember every detail of my past, especially all the little happy moments, but I do, unfortunately, remember a lot of the bad, even though I’ve tried to block out as much as possible. Whether this is because my past is mostly bad or my memory struggles to retain little happy moments is for a psychologist to judge.



I was a red wine drunk conception. My unmarried parents got drunk on red wine one evening in 2001 and accidentally conceived me. My mother has always called it a happy accident (She wanted children). She claims I was an easy baby, I self-soothed with my thumb and blankie. So independent at such a young age that when I wanted out of my cot, I simply tried to climb out instead of crying for my parents and fell and broke my collarbone… Only then did I cry.



When my parents got red wine drunk a second time in 2003 and conceived my younger sister, I think my “easy” nature made them believe they could do this a second time. Still unmarried… Thank goodness they never got married.



I can’t remember how old I was when my father started cheating on my mother, too young to remember, obviously. Fun fact, you don’t start consistently retaining long-term memories until the age of five.



My mother was a childcare worker, my father worked with building companies by day and was a musician by night (a musician? I know, right? What was she thinking?).



His Cheating set this toxic pattern that continued until I was ten years old. What was that pattern, you may ask? We’d play happy family by playing games, going camping, watching tv together, and going to my father’s gigs (*sigh),* always going to his band stuff. This would last for a year or two if we were lucky (but we weren’t often that lucky), and then, when things were calm and quiet, which I assume felt stagnant to my father, my parents would start arguing. I knew the moment my parents started fighting that it meant he had cheated.

I assume he would get bored with my homebody mother, bored when she would give herself a break from doing whatever my father wanted to do (but always funding his hobbies). In that boredom, give in to easy “temptation,” and thus the fighting would begin.

They would fight by screaming and yelling at each other sometimes. When my father would get rather heated, he would break things; throw coffee tables and smash glass in doors… Oh, so many slammed doors. The moment my sister was old enough to be distressed by the commotion and the tension, I would try to shield her; take her to the other end of the house, cover her ears, distract her with games and toys, and when those would fail, I would hold her and wipe away her tears. I would try to comfort her with false promises that things would be okay.

1r0tryg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1r0tryg/just_a_story_in_an_h_mart/,Just a story in an H Mart,"I was sore and tired from working out at the gym. During cardio, pushed my heart rate to 184 bpm so I could feel okay about it, but the accomplishment felt empty. Not too long ago, I was a NEET – I’d go on walks, do chores, and watch Dr. K. Video games lost their luster, and I’d have forced myself to enjoy anime as much as I could. There was always a feeling in my gut that told me something was missing. And, now, even though I’m winning – making money and going to the gym, my life feels shallow. My friend and I went to an H mart to celebrate our small win.

My mind was focused on the intense smells of sweet, crisp apples, refreshing citrus, pungent seafood, and sizzlingly savory bulgogi. My friend and I finally selected our rewards for our tired muscles: kimbap, onigiri, and some sugary drinks. I didn’t notice at first, but standing beside me in the checkout line was my former high school English teacher. My face lit up, and I called his name in surprise. He turned around, just as surprised and delighted. I’ve been wanting to reach out and ask him out for a coffee for years, but something never felt right. Before I could think about what to say, his son, sitting in the high seat of the grocery cart, gleefully introduced himself with all his effort. His confidence and adorable face made my heart swell. After introducing myself, I turned my attention back to my former teacher. I wanted him to know I was doing okay, so he wouldn’t worry, but deep down, I don’t feel okay, and that shame came out a bit. I shared some of my accomplishments, but I just felt embarrassed about how I was talking. Maybe I’m not good enough, I couldn’t even have a normal conversation, but he’s busy – he has his family, so I said my good-byes. Besides, I was just happy to see him happy.

I wanted to leave it at that – a pleasant encounter, but I felt so defeated. Besides, it was time to eat -- my friend and I found a table at the H mart's food court. Still, my mind was busy. I collected my thoughts with a mouth stuffed with kimbap. Maybe I didn’t show enough interest in his kids? Why did I talk about myself?

When I was a teenager pretending to be an adult, I wanted his attention and approval. He’s a warm and kind person who’d listen without judgment. I didn’t get that growing up. Instead, I was responsible for my Mom when she’d freak out or ask for advice, and I’d stop my brothers from fighting. Otherwise, I had no armor to keep my true self safe. “No” was a dangerous word. I didn’t want to empathetically listen to my Mom’s dating problems, calm down fights, or do most of the chores. I wanted to be silly and be allowed to disagree. I wanted my Mom to take care of me, keep me safe, and see me for who I really am.

In a weird way, I saw that teacher as a fatherly figure because he gave me a little bit of what I wanted – someone who saw me. All these thoughts started to make me feel anxious – I wanted something to fix right then and there – apply for a better job, get a date for Valentine’s Day, or decide on a career path. I settled for downing a coconut smoothie.

What do I do now? Seeing his son smiling brightly made me want to become a father. But, being a dad to fix my feelings is messed up. I already tried that, probably. My younger brother said I was like a dad to him. Thankfully, I stepped out of that toxic role. It didn’t help me – it gave me a vague sense that I was being responsible and good. I tried all my life to feel like a good person, but it only ends up making me narcissistic, anyway. While I was in my head, my buddy got up to pick up his Katsu meal. I felt a little bit more freedom to think now that I was alone.

I eat, play video games, watch TV, and have fun with friends, but I’m not doing these activities for their own sake. I noticed that emptiness when I finished up my kimbap. Tasty, but unsatisfying. No point in treating myself to something better -- I wouldn't enjoy it anyway. Then, I downed one red bean pancake after another. It’s like I’m trying to cover up this pain – trying to hide it from everyone. The only authentic joy I felt was from thinking about how good a dad my former teacher seemed and how happy his son looked. When my friend returned, I expressed my joy enthusiastically, “Wasn’t his kid so cute! It's awesome and adorable how he introduced himself!” He arched his eyebrow into a questioning look, “You’re thinking a lot about your teacher, huh?” I felt judged and small — there was an urge to agree. It’s weird how much I care for my teacher. Is it okay that I'm sad I'll probably never see him again? I should let go of this melancholic joy because it’s uncomfortably strange? I didn’t want to, though, so I mustered up the energy to proudly say, “Well, of course, I love that guy”.",2,1770706276.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False
1r0trxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BornWeakBuiltStrong/comments/1r0trxn/the_psychology_of_speaking_english_like_a_native/,The Psychology of Speaking English Like a Native (Even If You Never Lived There),"I spent years consuming content about language learning. books, research papers, polyglot youtube channels, linguistics podcasts. the works. and honestly? most advice out there is either obvious (watch movies in english!) or completely impractical (move to an english speaking country for 5 years!).

after digging through actual research and testing methods on myself and language exchange partners, I've figured out what actually works. this isn't about perfect grammar or sounding like a textbook. it's about communicating naturally and confidently.

The uncomfortable truth about accents and fluency

nobody talks about this, but your brain literally works against you when learning a new language. after puberty, your brain starts pruning neural pathways for sounds you don't use in your native language. so yeah, biology isn't on your side. add in the fact that most english education systems focus on reading and writing instead of actual speaking, and you get people who can write a perfect essay but freeze up in conversation.

the good news is neuroplasticity is real. your brain can rewire itself at any age. it just takes the right approach.

Stop translating in your head

this is the biggest mistake intermediate learners make. you're literally adding an extra step between thinking and speaking. it's like running a race with a backpack full of rocks.

the fix is something called ""thinking in english"" and it sounds impossible but it's not. start small. narrate your daily activities in english inside your head. ""I'm making coffee. the water is boiling. I need to add milk."" feels weird at first but after a few weeks, you'll notice yourself reaching for english words directly instead of translating from your native language.

[Fluent Forever](https://www.gabrielwyner.com/) by Gabriel Wyner (he's an opera singer who learned multiple languages for performances) breaks down the neuroscience behind this. insanely good read. he explains how creating direct connections between concepts and english words (instead of going through your native language) is what separates intermediate speakers from advanced ones. the book won numerous awards and completely changed how I approached language learning.

Shadowing is the cheat code

this technique comes from interpretation training. you listen to native speakers and repeat what they say immediately, matching their rhythm, intonation, stress patterns. everything.

pick content slightly above your level. for me, it was podcast interviews because they're conversational but still clear. stuff like ""The Tim Ferriss Show"" works great because guests speak at different paces and with various accents.

do this for 15 minutes daily. your mouth needs to build muscle memory for english sounds that don't exist in your native language. this isn't about understanding every word, it's about training your mouth and ears simultaneously.

Record yourself (yes, it's painful)

nobody wants to hear their own voice but this is non negotiable. record yourself speaking for 2 minutes about any random topic. then listen back.

you'll immediately catch things you can't notice while speaking. maybe you're dropping the ends of words. maybe your sentences are too choppy. maybe you're speaking way too fast because you're nervous.

compare your recording to a native speaker discussing the same topic. apps like ELSA Speak use AI to analyze your pronunciation and give specific feedback on which sounds you're struggling with. it's like having a pronunciation coach in your pocket. the app was developed by Stanford researchers and uses speech recognition technology that's genuinely impressive.

Immersion without moving countries

change your phone language to english. change your inner monologue to english. join online communities about your hobbies where everyone speaks english.

I started participating in reddit threads about topics I actually cared about (not language learning forums, actual hobby subreddits). when you're focused on discussing something you're passionate about, you stop obsessing over making mistakes. you're just trying to communicate an idea.

discord servers and online gaming communities are goldmines for this. real time communication with native speakers who aren't there to judge your english, they just want to play the game or discuss the topic.

The YouTube method that actually works

forget subtitles in your native language. they're a crutch. instead, watch content with english subtitles, or better yet, auto generated captions that show you exactly what's being said.

but here's the key: watch stuff you'd watch anyway. don't force yourself to watch boring english teaching channels. if you like cooking, watch Babish. if you're into tech, watch Linus Tech Tips. if you're into self improvement, check out HealthyGamerGG (a Harvard trained psychiatrist who breaks down mental health and communication in super accessible ways).

your brain learns better when you're emotionally invested in the content.

Speak from day one (even if you suck)

waiting until you're ""ready"" is procrastination wearing a disguise. find language exchange partners on apps like HelloTalk or Tandem. these aren't dating apps pretending to be language tools, they're actual communities of people trying to learn.

set up 15 minute calls with native speakers. yeah, it's uncomfortable. yeah, you'll make mistakes. that's literally the point. your brain needs feedback loops to improve.

one trick: prepare 3 topics before each call. it removes the panic of ""what do I talk about"" and lets you focus on actually speaking.

The grammar trap

intermediate speakers often sabotage themselves by obsessing over perfect grammar. native speakers break grammar rules constantly in conversation. they use sentence fragments. they start sentences with ""and"" or ""but"". they split infinitives.

focus on being understood, not being perfect. most communication breakdowns happen because of unclear pronunciation or poor vocabulary choices, not because you used the wrong tense.

that said, [English Grammar in Use](https://www.cambridge.org/) by Raymond Murphy is the one grammar book worth owning. it's used in Cambridge courses worldwide and explains concepts with actual usage examples instead of academic jargon. but use it as a reference, not a bible.

Vocabulary that sticks

flashcards don't work for most people because there's no context. instead, learn phrases and collocations (words that naturally go together).

native speakers don't say ""very good"", they say ""pretty good"" or ""really good"". they don't ""do a meeting"", they ""have a meeting"" or ""attend a meeting"". these patterns matter more than individual words.

the app Anki lets you create context based flashcards with example sentences. you're not memorizing ""ubiquitous means widespread"", you're learning ""smartphones have become ubiquitous in modern society"".

Your accent doesn't matter as much as you think

there are more non native english speakers than native speakers globally. english is a tool for communication, not a test of how well you can cosplay as someone from California.

that said, if your accent genuinely prevents understanding, focus on stress patterns and intonation rather than individual sounds. english is a stress timed language, which means some syllables are emphasized and others are reduced. getting this wrong makes you harder to understand than having a thick accent.

The plateau is real but temporary

you'll hit a point where you feel stuck. you can have conversations but you're not improving anymore. this happens because you've optimized for your current level. you need to increase difficulty.

start consuming content made for native speakers. read actual novels, not graded readers. listen to podcasts at 1.2x speed. have conversations about abstract topics, not just ""what did you do today"".

the discomfort means you're growing.

[BeFreed](https://www.befreed.ai/) is an AI-powered personalized learning app that's been solid for building these English language skills consistently. Built by Columbia alumni and AI experts from Google, it transforms content from books, research papers, and expert talks into custom podcasts tailored to your specific goals.

Type in what you're working on, like improving pronunciation or speaking confidently as a non-native speaker, and it pulls from vetted sources to create a learning plan just for you. You control the depth, from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, everything from calm and educational to sarcastic depending on your mood. Makes it easy to fit real growth into commute time or other sessions without feeling like work.

Consistency beats intensity

30 minutes daily beats 3 hour weekend cram sessions. your brain needs regular exposure to form lasting neural pathways.

treat it like brushing your teeth. non negotiable part of your routine.

learning a language isn't a sprint or even a marathon. it's more like going to the gym. you don't ""finish"" learning english, you just get better at using it. and just like fitness, the people who succeed are the ones who make it a permanent part of their lifestyle, not a temporary project.

the methods I've shared come from years of research into second language acquisition, applied linguistics, and honestly just trial and error. some will work better for you than others. test them out. keep what works. ditch what doesn't.",1,1770706274.0,BornWeakBuiltStrong,0,1.0,False

Each time, I'd download a new app, set up my ideal routine, feel super motivated for maybe 3-5 days, and then... nothing. The app would just sit there, mocking me with its perfect blank squares, a constant reminder of another failed attempt to ""get consistent."" I’d feel this terrible mix of guilt, frustration, and a quiet resignation that maybe habit building just wasn't for me.

My biggest mistake was always overcomplicating it. I thought I needed streaks, fancy metrics, gamification, and a dashboard full of green checkmarks to prove I was doing well. I'd try to track 5 new habits at once, convinced I could completely overhaul my life in a week. *Spoiler: I couldn't.* Every time I missed a day, that perfect digital streak was broken, and it felt like starting over, so I just... didn't. The ""aha moment"" came when I realized I was making the *act of tracking* harder than the habit itself. I needed to remove every possible speck of friction.

Here's the **one small system** that finally made consistency stick, leading to 6 months of daily check-ins:

1.  **Choose *One* (Yes, ONE) Keystone Habit:** Forget the elaborate routines for now. Pick *one* single, small habit that you genuinely want to integrate. Something so tiny it feels almost silly not to do it. For me, it was ""meditate for 5 minutes."" Not 30, not an hour, just five. The goal is to build the *muscle of showing up*, not to achieve perfection.
2.  **Go Analog & Obvious:** Ditch the apps initially. Get a physical calendar (the bigger, the better!) or a dedicated sticky note. Place it somewhere you *cannot avoid seeing it* at the exact time you plan to do your habit. Mine is on the fridge, right next to the coffee maker. *The visual cue is everything.*
3.  **The ""X"" is the Win:** As soon as you complete your habit, immediately put a big, satisfying ""X"" on that day’s square. Don't ponder, don't delay. The moment you're done, mark it. *The satisfaction of physically marking that X became its own tiny reward, reinforcing the behavior.* I realized the act of tracking itself was becoming a habit.
4.  **Embrace the ""Missed Day"" Protocol:** This is critical. You *will* miss a day. It's inevitable. When you do, **DO NOT give up.** The old me would see a blank square and throw in the towel. The new me understands that *one blank square doesn't negate all the X's before it.* Just acknowledge it, let it go, and commit to getting an X tomorrow. **Consistency is about showing up again after you fall, not about never falling.**
5.  **Weekly Check-in, Not Daily Pressure:** Every Sunday morning, I spend 5 minutes looking back at my calendar. Not to scold myself for misses, but to celebrate the wins and reflect on why I might have missed. *This isn't about perfect streaks, but about honest self-assessment and gentle course correction.*

This isn't magic, and it certainly wasn't instant. I almost gave up around week 3 when I missed two days in a row due to travel. I felt that familiar voice creeping in: *“See? You failed again.”* But this time, I just thought, *""Okay, but what's one more X? Let's just try tomorrow.""* And I did. This system might not work for everyone; if you thrive on complex data or need external accountability, this might feel too simple. But for chronic habit-starters-and-quitters like me, it's about making it so easy that *not* doing it requires more effort than *doing* it. Expect to feel a shift around 30 days, but real, ingrained consistency takes months.

**6 months later**, I've not only consistently meditated for 5 minutes every single day, but that small success has spilled over. It taught me that *I am capable of consistency*. I've since added reading 10 pages a day using the same method, and guess what? That calendar is filling up too. It's not about being ""perfectly productive,"" but about building self-trust and proving to myself, day after day, that I can show up for myself. I feel calmer, more focused, and genuinely proud of this quiet, steady progress.

Did you know I think about you nearly all the time? Not bad things either. I had a dream you were angry with me. It's hard not knowing what's real.  I really am trying to put this behind me, not because I don't love you but because you don't want me. It can't continue like this. I used to get high and listen to *your playlist* and thought we were connected in the ether. For ages. I wonder why I never came to see you before. You were married obvs but also I thought I couldn't bear for it not to be true, to go and you just ignore me. I thought it would be unbearable to find out. But I decided to that first time because I thought I had to to now or never and you'd been poorly and sad and I thought I could help you. I was sending thoughts out to you that first time telling you where I would be and you did see me! But I never did find out. More confused than ever. I know you are wonderful,  talented, special, super handsome and clever. And super attractive :) I wish you would've talked to me like a person. Sometimes I wonder if you hated me or thought I was your enemy in a strange way. I know you've been hurt by love but I'm not a bad person. I ve loved you as long as I can remember, I would never let you down in reality. It's ok if you don't love me back. Even if you just wanted company sometimes. 

You are the best man. ",1,1770705930.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,1.0,False

My work is mainly desk work, no labor, but requires a certain amount of effort, brain and emotional capacity.

I work 6am-3pm, counting commute that's two additional hours, and 1 hour lunch break in the middle of the work day.

Not alot of freedom leaving the desk whenever wanted but there are two other breaks, 20mns each.

Once 1pm hits, I feel extremely exhausted and sleepy, but not enough to go home and hit a power nap.

My sleep isnt the best, I try to sleep early to wake up at 5am without issues but the quality of my sleep is kind of bad, alot of nightmares, the occasional night terrors, so I wake up a tad bit tired.

My diet is good, I eat plenty of veggies, protein, I stay hydrated but also drink around 5 cups of black coffee a day to stay awake and bit able to focus, I walk around 40mns a day, which isnt alot but it's what I can manage with work and house chores.

My question is as the title, in addition to: how can I fit a work out plan? I want to get a treadmill and a sandbag, will those help make me stronger or should I lift?

I tested for iron deficiency before but it wasnt too low and I eat to recover the loss, I dont take any vitamins or medication.

Overall, I am in the healthy bunch but my sleep, early mornings and very little time to do other things is causing a bit of strain and stress.

My weekends are basically house chores, errands and watch TV to unwind.

Oh Reddit wise ones, please help me.
