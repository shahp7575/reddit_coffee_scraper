So I moved out of Gwinnett County to attend college out of state. Like most students, I quickly realized I needed extra cash books, food, rent it adds up fast. I applied for the usual part-time jobs: coffee shops, campus library, tutoring but nothing really worked out. Either the schedules clashed with my classes or they just weren‚Äôt hiring.

Recently stumbled across a weird gig of watching Netflix shows and getting paid to write reviews about the shows, The crazy part is: I already love movies and shows. So now I basically just watch stuff I enjoy anyway, write a few honest thoughts, and get paid for it.

If anyone‚Äôs interested, You can send a message to me. My main reason for sharing is honestly to help out anyone who might be in a similar situation trying to make a little extra cash without crazy hours or exhausting side jobs. I know a lot of folks in my community are looking for legit ways to earn on the side, so if this can help even a few people like it helped me, I‚Äôm happy to share.",1,1749917391.0,Gwinnett,0,1.0,False

* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**
 
 if they are reliable, yes

 
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**
 
 performance is most important, it will usually only be used at home but I‚Äôd also like to use it for school in the future.

 
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**
 
 I don‚Äôt want it looking crazy with a bunch of rgb lights and super thick, I still want it to look presentable in a coffee shop, I‚Äôm definitely not a huge gamer.
 
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 
 N/A, it will usually be hooked up to a monitor (so a desktop would be ok)
 
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 
 
I use photoshop very lightly for some t-shirt design but that‚Äôs never very intensive.

I want some at least ok shaders, 30-60 pfs is totally acceptable to me, also subnautica, jedi fallen order (this one might be unrealistic)

Day one of my food log shows my coffee to be a total of 7 calories for three cups of coffee and today it‚Äôs 21 calories for the exact same servings of coffee. 

Second thing is more of a suggestion. Is there a way that you could add a base coffee scanner to make it easier to add specific foods to the log that may not be in the list already. Maybe make it where when someone adds a particular food with the scanner it‚Äôs now integrated into the food bank on the app permanently.

1lbc39r,https://www.reddit.com/r/RDCWorld/comments/1lbc39r/an_rdc_fans_trip_to_japan/,An RDC Fan's Trip to Japan,"What's good y'all, I just wanted to share my personal experience here from a recent trip to Japan. I know my boys were talking about planning a trip sometime, and I saw that Dreamcon had a panel about travelling to Japan, so I thought I'd give some input.

This will be a long post so bear with me!  
I spent most of my time in Tokyo, so when I say ""Japan"" just know that I am referring to the Tokyo area.  
I won't make this an XXXXL long post so I'll highlight some things and I'm happy to answer DMs if you have questions.

Everyone has their own experience, this is just mine, so I'm open to hearing y'all thoughts and opinions.

**Getting There**  
Off the bat I'm just gonna say that the most expensive thing about Japan is just getting there. I am blessed to have finally been able to save up for a big trip like this. As a kid who grew up in Texas just like my RDC guys and a lot of my fellow fans, this just isn't something that people get to do often in the small town I'm from. This took a lot of restraint lmao and honestly just putting stuff into a savings account. My process was literally ""I could buy this $120 pair of shoes, but then again that could be $120 towards the Japan fund"", and eventually that turned into enough for the trip. Little habits like this will help in the long run.

The **round trip flight** will cost you around $1,000. I did a lot of research and found that you should stay away from the $1,300+ price range because flights will eventually come down to $950-$1,100. Just be patient and track flights using [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights) . This is a great resource for travel in general since they alert you when prices are hella low.

**Preparing (Luggage & Language)**  
Alright gang off rip I'm not gone hold y'all, people in Japan got that \[stuff\] on. DM me if you have questions about this if you're someone who cares about fashion lol. If not, you will still have a great time regardless!

One big surprising thing about Japan is that people walk so much everywhere, so I need NEED y'all to bring at least 1 pair of **comortable shoes**. You WILL be walking and you WILL be sightseeing. I walked at least 17,000 steps every single day I was there and regretted not packing something better than my New Balances. Please y'all, bring a good pair of walking shoes so you don't damage your feet or back.

I went for 10 days (look, if I'm gonna travel somewhere that I probably won't return to for a long time I need to enjoy as much as I can) and I brought on the plane 1 carry on and 1 checked bag. This was more than enough for someone just sightseeing.

The **flight** is very long. If you're coming from Texas, you will probably connect in California (this is a 3ish hour flight) and then from California you'll travel to Tokyo for 12ish hours. This was the longest flight I've ever been on. The flight had hella movies and games so that was entertaining, but I still brought my switch (Nintendo) and saved some music/podcasts. DM or comment for tips for the actual flight.

I brought two **english to japanese translation books** that were a huge life saver. Japanese people will have varying knowledge of English and they really appreciate if you try to speak a little bit of Japanese, and will actually be willing to help more if you attempt Japanese. Some people will speak fluent English, especially in and around the airport, but please be prepared for people who do not speak English at all.

I recommend the [Lonely Planet Japanese Phrasebook](https://www.amazon.com/Lonely-Planet-Japanese-Phrasebook-Dictionary/dp/1788680855/ref=sr_1_1?crid=23C8NT94BLADC&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Fs6LkZPN5LI7NbgJTrEE2HqRusqlo1mrmgYK-dMOUSoH3oDldMuCp6sJiCcjLxakpr1vXH8uorc-FTAHHWNOpjF0YZHHTxB9O9eA2NHzFRMftnpvAzYXdodQl3hQZJZWszKM8khv_twfcae5tDzUPvADdtsFlQIhNwmKAqQqwj9Q0Egoqno1ZAb6KEeibil4XvHbu8Ji2O8iDl0DNSIoBvBqmMJ74wXbTBdG5Lp0SHw.rJ5bVn82ZgyGMAq5_iENRQ9n4Pt-2CTK4t459rSXUjA&dib_tag=se&keywords=lonely+planet+japanese+phrasebook&qid=1749912126&s=books&sprefix=lonely+planet+japanese+phrasebook%2Cstripbooks%2C106&sr=1-1)

These books were super small, about the size of your iphone, so they're great for pulling out of your pocket when you're in a pinch.

If you speak Spanish like me, or another Latin language, then Japanese pronunciation should be easier for you to pick up.

**Money**  
Another big thing for Americans going to Japan is that everything is way more **affordable**. You can go on a date for two in Austin or Dallas and spend like $60 or $70 USD (United States Dollar) on lunch/dinner for two. I kid you not most meals we had in Japan *with* 1 drink/beer each were **$5-$8USD**. I was blown away y'all this was crazy, and nearly every coffee, snack, donut, pastry, were in the $1.50-$3 price range.

Depending on your financial situation and how you plan to enjoy Japan, I would say that you should be good with roughly $30-$40 a day for food. (PLEASE TRY JAPANESE DONUTS Y'ALL)

Besides walking everywhere, I primarily traveled on the **subway**, which is roughly $1-$2 USD per ride. Please do not use Uber, the subway is mad clean and quiet, just be mindful of morning rush and evening rush when people are traveling to and from work. It will be packed. If you're from New York you will be more than prepared lmao.

The exchange rate right now is still pretty good in Japan, with $1 USD being 144 Japanese Yen. You can **exchange money** at the airport when you arrive or at any ATM in the dozens of 7-Elevens you'll find spread throughout Tokyo. You can also exchange money with your bank before leaving for Japan, you just need to request it 2 weeks in advance.

**Getting Around & Using Your Phone**  
I cannot emphasize more that you need to **charge your phone** every night and that **GOOGLE MAPS** will be your best friend. As a person from Texas who didn't grow up using any sort of subway, I can say that Google Maps will give you extremely specific navigation and help getting around Japan. It will tell you in English and Japanese which subway station to go to for your desired destination, how long it'll take you to get to the station, which subway train to take if you miss your train, how packed it is, and even what stops that train will be making. (Sorry if I'm using ""train"" wrong, idc you get what I mean).

I did get on the wrong subway train once or twice and immediately realized when the stops listed on my phone were not the same as the stops that were listed inside the car.

The subway can be scary at first, but there lots of instructions on getting around.

For cell service, I have AT&T so I did their built-in travel plan that was unlimited data every day for $12. This was way easier than the eSIM that most people do. I've read and heard that the eSim is pretty easy, but the built-in travel data was literally hands free. It just automatically switched over once I touched down in Japan and vise versa.  


**Sleeping**  
And I'm not talking about the fighting kind. You will find plenty of hotel options in Tokyo, it's a massive city. The accommodations range from a bedroom in someone's house to a penthouse in a hotel. There are options for your financial situation. I wanted to stay in a more lowkey area, but not too far from the major sightseeing spots, so I chose to stay in Ueno (an area within Japan). Traveling to other popular areas by subway never took more than like 15 minutes. You can stay in a hotel in Akihabara or Shinjuku if you're looking for a more nightlife experience and want to be around a lot more lights and attractions, or you can stay in Ueno or other areas if you're just trying to come back to a chill area.

The hotel rooms and bathrooms are **very small** on most occasions. If you are above 6' and/or 250 lbs, not only will you strike fear in Ben's heart, but you will also find the hotel and its bathroom to be a tight fit. This is just what is most common so be prepared. 

**Culture**  
In my experience, having grown up in Texas and Mexico, Japanese culture (at least the small fraction I experienced) was crazy different. Please be respectful and mindful of Japanese culture when you travel. Generally I found Japanese streets, shops, and subway stations to be extremely **clean and quiet**. You can walk 50 feet in a Texas city and fill a bag or two with trash (this is not hating, I love my state and people I'm just stating observations); you will struggle to do this in Japan. Keep this in mind if you get bubble guts and you're worried about messy/dirty restrooms; you will be more than fine finding a clean restroom everywhere you go.

Japanese streets, subway cars, and shops were very quiet outside of small 1-to-1 conversations people were having, so please be respectful of everyone's personal space. Tokyo is a massive city with thousands of people just trynna ride the subway home from work, they don't want a group of people being loud. You can bring headphones and chill. I seen way too many videos of weirdos entering Japan and acting up. We're RDC family, we do not do that. Just keep an eye out, read the room, and act accordingly. If you're at a bar, club, or hotel then you'll be fine being louder and doing your thing.

I found it to be very safe and generally locals will not treat you poorly or negatively if you're a foreigner if you're just chilling. 

**Shopping**  
There is lots to talk about here so just DM me or comment below for recommendations and other tips.

One huge tip is to **finish your food or drink** wherever you're at, be it a donut shop, coffee shop, or 7-Eleven. There are **no public trashcans** so if you don't finish your food/drink you will be carrying it all day until you get back to your hotel. This was crazy to me (but I get it!) I made this mistake early on where I'd get a coffee in the morning and be left carrying the empty cup for hours because I took the subway to the other side of Tokyo. Again, be respectful and don't litter.  
If you're gonna go out and buy souvenirs, bring a fanny pack or buy one of those reinforced shopping bags that are sold in nearly all convenience stores in Japan (they literally look like a thick/durable plastic bags).

**Conclusion**

I had a bad ass time y'all, especially for my first trip outside of North America. For any of y'all that want to travel abroad and are looking for destinations, I cannot recommend Japan more. I have read some horror stories about traveling to other countries so traveling to Japan felt like riding a bike with training wheels, it was a very easy experience.

I did travel to the countryside, spoke with locals who knew a little bit of English so we made the half-and-half language barrier work, hung out with other foreigners, ate good food, drank good drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic), and I did get to see the cherry blossoms. But these are all story times for another day.

here‚Äôs the thing. he goes out in public wearing just a tank top and boxers. like boxers. not shorts that look like boxers. actual mf boxers. and i get it, dorm life is chill and it‚Äôs normal to go out in a hoodie and slippers when you‚Äôre just getting something from the cafeteria or doing a laundry run. but he goes out like that way too often, and it‚Äôs not just within the dorms. sometimes he meets up with friends or goes to grab coffee near campus like that. and i‚Äôm not even exaggerating just a tight tank, visible bulge in thin-ass fabric, biceps out, and boxers riding low. no shame. like he‚Äôs casually flaunting.

i‚Äôve brought it up to him before, and he kind of laughed it off and said he‚Äôs just comfy like that and it‚Äôs not that deep. i tried to explain that it makes me uncomfortable not because i don‚Äôt trust him, but because girls stare, and i‚Äôm left there feeling weird while he‚Äôs out here looking like a casual walking thirst trap. he said i was overthinking and that he doesn‚Äôt even notice people looking at him like that. and to be fair, he really isn‚Äôt the show-off type. but still, it bothers me. not enough to fight over it or anything, but just enough to make me wonder if this would bug anyone else too.

so yeah. am i just being controlling/insecure? or would this bug any of you too? especially if your bf was hot and half-naked in public like it‚Äôs nbd.",0,1749916778.0,AskMen,13,0.5,False

I decided to drop by say hello and make another run at trying to find that one bestie, new friend who would make me run to the phone to read their messages üòÜ 

Good thing is that I actually made and enjoying my morning coffee ‚òïÔ∏è‚Äî Italian of course, or nothing else! 

So about the three reasons, before I lose you, cause we all know Reddit attention span is a very scarce resource lol; 

1- The obvious one: I‚Äôm naturally funny- all organic of course- and tell me what hat you want, but everyone benefits from a good and healthy dose of humor ;) 

2- I too am genuinely interested in making a new bestie! So this is a win/win for both of us lol 

3- 100% friendship satisfaction guaranteed or dineros back! lol jk! You know what I mean‚Ä¶ not trying to get in anyone‚Äôs pants obviously! 

Alrighty, I gotta try to make some breakfast and the big question now is: 

Blueberry ü´ê pancakes or 

French toast! 

Cheers and have a lovely day!

1lbby8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/groupSense/comments/1lbby8o/should_we_follow_the_crowd_or_trust_our_gut/,Should We Follow the Crowd or Trust Our Gut?,"You ever walk into a place, say, a bar or a cafe, and it‚Äôs packed, yet there's another right across the street that‚Äôs almost empty? I always end up second-guessing which one to go into. I think it‚Äôs all about that weird thing called 'social proof'. It‚Äôs basically our brains nudging us towards the majority‚Äôs choice ‚Äî like, if everyone‚Äôs going one way, we assume they know something we don't. 

But it makes me wonder... how often do we ignore our gut feeling just 'cause of this? I‚Äôve had times where I followed the crowd to a busy spot only to find meh coffee, when maybe the quieter place across the street would've been amazing. I guess we tend to believe that a crowd equals quality, though it isn't always true. It‚Äôs like a psychological shortcut that tricks us sometimes. 

So do you think it's better to trust our gut or go where the people are? Maybe it's about finding a balance... taking a moment to question why we‚Äôre doing what we‚Äôre doing rather than just blindly going with the herd. ü§î",6,1749916445.0,groupSense,0,1.0,False
1lbby37,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1lbby37/couldnt_keep_the_mask_on_any_more/,Couldn‚Äôt keep the mask on any more,"I‚Äôm 48. Undiagnosed, as in it‚Äôs not in my medical chart, but every professional has told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the spectrum‚Äù. Most people that know me would agree, take it for granted. I‚Äôm married, and have one kid (grade school).

I‚Äôve been ok to very good at masking. When I left my past job I was taken aback when someone said they will miss me because I was one of the few extroverted developers they had. I was *that* good, then. God if only they knew how useless I was at the end of the day.

I absolutely need routine. I hate travel and ‚Äúvacations‚Äù for the same reason people around me seem to love them. When I work (remote, sw developer) I need the room to be dark, quiet. I have my home office dialed in perfectly ‚Äî gray walls, soft lighting, noise padding on the walls. My speakers are tilted 15 degrees up so they are at the same angle as my monitor, etc. I live in the Bay Area where the weather is usually 70s and sunny. 

Long story short I‚Äôm in Phoenix with my family, for what is supposed to be a couple months. I am still working remotely.

I quickly learned I can‚Äôt work in our temporary apartment. It‚Äôs incredibly bright, and the family is around doing family stuff. Luckily where we are staying, they have a work-office area with desks and four sound-proof pods for taking calls. Well, guess where I usually spent the work day.

Up until yesterday. I knew something was going on in the morning. I tried on four different shirts and got frustrated because they were all too tight. It‚Äôs hot out, so I put on shorts, but I hate shorts because the hem at the bottom is constantly tickling my thigh when I walk. I saw some loose fitting pants, so I thought well I‚Äôll be in AC all day, so what does it matter. 

I tried to work in the apartment for a bit, but the AC kept klunking on and family was making noise in the kitchen area 10‚Äô from my desk. So I said no problem, I‚Äôll go to the office area. 

As I‚Äôm walking outside it‚Äôs 100 already. I start getting agitated by the heat. I get to the office area, and it‚Äôs full of people, of course because it‚Äôs hot and I got there late. That irritates me more and then I notice all the pods are full. Shit, I have to work out in the open. I put in headphones and open my laptop and immediately get bombed by Slack messages. At that point I start spiraling and I mark myself as sick and close the laptop and leave the building.

At this point I‚Äôm close to full-on panic/meltdown. I just needed to retreat to our bedroom, make it as dark as possible, and sleep it off. 

Instead, as I‚Äôm walking back I run into my wife. She can tell I‚Äôm upset, and she says she doesn‚Äôt want our kid to see me like that so don‚Äôt go home. I say there is nowhere else to go. She says let‚Äôs go to this coffee shop here. I said that‚Äôs a bad idea but she insists. 

We get into the shop and it‚Äôs full of people. I tried *hard* to act normal. I‚Äôm in line looking at the menu. Then all of the sudden someone shouts my wife‚Äôs name and they go ‚Äúoh hey!!!!‚Äù and give each other a big hug. I have no idea who this person is. My wife immediately goes into full social mode and is excited. She introduces me and I smile as hard as I could. The lady then asks ‚Äúoh wow, so what do you think? Don‚Äôt you LOVE it here??? lol‚Äù I can‚Äôt explain it, but the question came across as evil.

That was it. I couldn‚Äôt do it. I looked her in the eye and said, loudly ‚ÄúNo I F*CKing HATE it here!‚Äù and stormed out. Her reaction was at first a quick chuckle like I was making a big joke but then I left and didn‚Äôt come back.

My wife was horrified. Turns out that person is #2 here in their area of work. 

I ran back home, went to the bedroom, and slept for four hours. 

My wife is now telling me she wants me to fly back home and she doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel safe‚Äù around me. I tried to explain that all I wanted was to go back to my bedroom, and that going to a coffee shop was absolutely the last place I wanted to go. No matter how I explain it she says that it would have been worse if I went home and our kid saw me,  but that‚Äôs absolutely not true I would have said I didn‚Äôt feel well, and that would have been it (and eventually exactly what I did). 

I‚Äôm going to try and get a professional diagnosis now. Not for me, but for my family and wife. 

She said I looked exactly like those people on that ‚Äúlove on the spectrum‚Äù show when they need a timeout during their dates. At least that‚Äôs a start.

First, does anyone have ideas on why it would blow? My PID and thermostats should be fine and the machine wasn‚Äôt too hot.

Anyone have any advice? It looks like four crimps. Crush on the metal butte connectors and then crimp the thermal fuse onto those, then slide the new silicone tube on it. My old tube came apart a bit when I was probing it for continuity

Four great dates, then I brought up exclusivity, and now he seems distant. How can I (40F) restore his (39M) attraction level?","I‚Äôve (40F) been seeing a recently divorced dad (39M) for about a month now. We met online, talked for about three weeks and met up. The first date went extremely well. Met for coffee, then had lunch and moved to different public places. It lasted for six hours. We had so much fun and just kept laughing and laughing that I didn‚Äôt get to ask him all the important questions like what is it he is looking for. He later said it was the greatest first date and as if we had known each other for a long time, but he also said he was afraid he was being friend zoned because we were so goofy. He initiated a second date and we met again the next weekend. We had another blast. This time he was all over me physically. He invited himself to my apartment but I didn‚Äôt let him in and we had our first kiss in front of my door after he asked to kiss me. Two days later after not responding to my text he suddenly asked me if I wanted to have dinner that evening, to which I said yes. We had a short impromptu dinner date and again, I didn‚Äôt let him in to my apartment and we kissed some more in front of my door. He came to see me again for our fourth date the next weekend, and yet we had another unbelievably great time. This time I let him in to my apartment and we made out a lot.

All this time we had been texting each other a lot and he would sometimes call me too in between dates. He also called me beautiful and sweetheart in his texts and calls. But the day after we made out he was not as responsive to my texts, but suddenly called me that night saying that he had been thinking of me all day. We spoke for over 2 hours. At the end of the call, however, idk how it started but I brought up the topic of exclusivity, to which he said it‚Äôs a topic that we should be talking in person not over the phone. He also said he‚Äôs not seeing anyone else.

He said a lot of things on that call like how he wanted to kiss me while lifting me like in the movies. He also always talked a lot about future plans like we should and will do this and that together, even Christmas plans! And it‚Äôs still June. I thought he was interested in a relationship but then after that short convo about exclusivity I noticed a change of in his communication. He has not texted me as much (almost none), stopped calling me beautiful, and stopped texting good morning. I thought he had lost interest but I gave him the benefit of the doubt as he was going through some stressful situations. Four days went by with very little communication. After he shut me down with ‚Äúhave a good night‚Äù when I was trying to chat by text, I decided I was going to back off. A full day, Friday, went by without any text and suddenly he called me that night like nothing happened. He asked how I was doing and if I had any weekend plans. I said I had something to do with my friends on Sunday, that‚Äôs it. He didn‚Äôt ask me out again but said I should come down to his new place sometime. He just got a new place and would be moving in soon. He was driving so he ended the call early with ‚ÄúCall me sometime!‚Äù And we still have no plans for a fifth date.¬†

I wonder if I scared him away for bringing up exclusivity talk too soon. But he was sooo eager. I thought he wanted me to be his only one. The only reason I said it was because we were getting physical and I have a problem with that if he‚Äôs still seeing other women. I don‚Äôt want to come off as too eager as I don‚Äôt know much about this person yet either, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to lose him yet. I want a long term relationship but idk where he‚Äôs at. Rn I just wish I had just played it cool and not mentioned exclusivity at all that soon. I want to back track and go back to where we were. I really want to see him again, but not sure if I should initiate it/show any eagerness. I want to just be totally honest to him; apologize for putting him on the spot and tell him I want to keep my options open and go with the flow. But I‚Äôm really afraid of bringing up this conversation again. Maybe I should just withdraw quietly hoping that will make him chase me again. Idk. What would be the best/safest next step for me?

Any advice on how to thread this water would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry it‚Äôs so long but I wanted to give as much context as possible. There are other questionable things like he made a joke after our great second date that he ‚Äúwas just in this for my hot bod‚Äù to which I was confused and confronted him nicely. He apologized and made it clear that he wanted ‚Äúsomething more‚Äù with me and not a hookup. But I‚Äôm still not sure up till now what he wants with me. We've had some serious conversations like about having kids, etc. though it was over the phone and he later said ‚Äúwe have to be careful not to talk about these casually by phone‚Äù.¬†

TLDR: Guy was pursuing me hot. Had the greatest four dates. We made out at my place. He called me the next day. After two hours talking I brought up exclusivity. He then stopped texting me as much and calling me pet names. But he called again after four days not to set up a date but telling me to call me sometime.

I would like to hear how people assess new shops.  Here is what I do typically when I travel.

1. Look at online pictures.  Do I see nice grinders typically and ek.  Do they prominently show a pour over station.  What kind of brewer are they using. Do they have la Marocca espresso.
2. Look at bags of coffee at shop.  Are they all blends - Bad.  Do they show tasting notes good.  Do they have any funky coffees-good.  Do they only offer 1 pour over coffee-bad.  Do they offer cortado‚Äôs -good
3. Ask the barista for a recommendation.  If they can‚Äôt talk about something they love turn around.  Hopefully they are really passionate about coffee
4. Order a pour over and a cortado.  See how they ask you for whole milk in cortado.  Good shops assume you want whole milk.
5. Drink both drinks.  Is the pour over good or at least ballpark have the expected tasting notes.  How is the espresso in the cortado.  Is the cortado milk temp right‚Ä¶.common mistake by bad barista‚Äôs

I have been to lots of shops and this works for me.  What are others doing?

So I spent the last seven years in a marriage built on a prophecy‚Äîand......","**Chapter 1**  
My husband Carter Kingsley's whole family has never liked me. That much, I've always known.  
His father avoids all family matters like the plague. His mother looks down on my middle-class background. And Carter? His heart was never mine to begin with. But our son, Ethan Kingsley, is six now. Bright. Charming. And I just couldn't bring myself to leave him. He even started learning French‚Äîand picked it up fast. Now he and Carter talk in French around the house like it's their own secret club. At first, I was proud. A child I gave birth to, so smart, making his father proud. It made me want to hold on to this family, even just a little longer. Until I started secretly studying French myself. And slowly, I began to understand what they were really saying. And little by little, my heart froze over.  
Turns out my own child, just like his father, was learning French not for school, But to please Vivienne the woman Carter's always loved. Vivienne, the childhood sweetheart who went off to France for grad school. They were inseparable once, But Carter's churchgoing, conservative parents rejected her Not for who she was, but because a pastor-turned-""counselor"" told them she was a poor match for the Kingsley legacy. Meanwhile, I‚Äîa girl from an average Ohio family‚Äîwas married into this Manhattan dynasty because that same counselor said I would bring ""stability and prosperity. So I spent the last seven years in a marriage built on a prophecy‚Äîand completely devoid of love. I was lost in thought when the sharp clang of Carter's fork against his plate snapped me out of it. He frowned like he always does when I take a second too long to think. Vivienne's back in the States. She's pregnant.""  
She'll be moving in so we can help take care of her. His eyes locked on me, full of warning.  
She's carrying a child now. Don't start any drama. Yeah. Pregnant women are delicate.  
  
Funny how that didn't apply when I was the one pregnant.  
  
Back then, only the baby mattered‚Äînever me.  
  
Even when I hemorrhaged during labor,  
  
As long as Ethan made it out of the delivery room alive,  
  
Carter never even came to check if I survived.  
  
I nodded.  
  
I didn't ask who the baby's father was.  
  
Back in the day, if Vivienne had tried to get even close to this house,  
  
I would've lost my mind.  
  
I fought. Screamed.  
  
And Carter only ever gave me cold indifference.  
  
But now, after understanding everything they whisper in French, I felt nothing.  
  
""I'll move out for a while,"" I said.  
  
""Give her space to rest.""  
  
Carter paused.  
  
Before he could respond, Ethan lit up with joy.  
  
""If Mommy's gone, does that mean I can be with Aunt Vivienne every day?""  
  
Even the smartest kid can't hide how he really feels.  
  
Carter stared into my eyes.  
  
Was he trying to figure out what I was planning?  
  
Or if I even had the strength left to care?  
  
For a second, maybe I imagined it‚Äîbut I thought I saw something soft flicker in his gaze.  
  
Still, Vivienne and her baby came first.  
  
Carter said gently, ""The house is big. No need to move out.  
  
But we have a place out in Westchester.  
  
I'll have it signed over to you.  
  
You can go there whenever you want‚Ä¶ clear your head.""  
  
I understood.  
  
This was my reward for ""being mature.""  
  
He hated that I might have tainted the family line.  
  
So now he was making sure his first love could carry their perfect child.  
  
No matter the cost.  
  
And he was willing to be generous about it.  
  
Which made me wonder‚Äî  
  
When the baby I'm carrying is born, will he be even more generous?  
  
After all, this time, I made sure Carter has nothing to do with it.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Vivienne moved in early that morning.  
  
I was in the garden watering and trimming my cosmos flowers.  
  
They were the only things in this cold, loveless house that bloomed because of me.  
  
Vivienne held her pregnant belly with one hand, covering her nose with the other.  
  
""Don't bother trimming them,"" she said with a dramatic sigh.  
  
""I can't stand the smell. Just get rid of them.""  
  
I stood and wiped some dirt off my cheek.  
  
Vivienne squinted at me, then seemed to realize something.  
  
""Oh‚Äîsorry, didn't realize it was you, Sienna.""  
  
'I thought you were the gardener.""  
  
She offered a tight smile.  
  
""Well, if these flowers are yours, I guess you'd be too sentimental to tear them out.""  
  
""I'll just deal with it.""  
  
Carter, standing beside her with a hand on her lower back, frowned.  
  
""You're pregnant. You don't have to ‚Äòdeal with' anything.""  
  
""It's just a bunch of flowers. Get rid of them.""  
  
I glanced down at the garden and gave a small smile.  
  
Carter thought I was hesitating, ready to scold me.  
  
But instead, I nodded.  
  
""Sure. I've got something to do soon anyway.""  
  
""Just have the gardener take care of it.""  
  
Carter paused, caught off guard by how calmly I agreed.  
  
For a second, I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy in his eyes.  
  
""I'll have them replanted at the Westwood property,"" he said softly.  
  
""I know you put a lot into them.""  
  
I did love those flowers.  
  
They were one of the few things I had to hold on to in this house.  
  
But now, it didn't matter anymore.  
  
""Whatever you think is best,"" I replied.  
  
I checked my phone‚Äîmy meeting with the investigator was in thirty minutes.  
  
I gave them both a polite nod.  
  
""Excuse me.""  
  
As I stepped past Carter, he suddenly grabbed my wrist.  
  
Vivienne looked at him, confused and slightly annoyed.  
  
He let go immediately.  
  
""Come back early,"" he said.  
  
""There's something I need to talk to you about.""  
  
I nodded.  
  
""Sure.""  
  
The moment I left the Kingsley estate, I could breathe again.  
  
Even if it was just for a little while.  
  
I met the investigator at a coffee shop downtown‚Äîthe same one I used to frequent back in college.  
  
The owner did a double take when she saw me.  
  
I guess I didn't look like the girl she remembered.  
  
Ever since marrying Carter, I hadn't really lived.  
  
The Kingsleys thought places like this were too... common.  
  
The investigator handed me a file.  
  
""The ultrasound confirms Vivienne is about four months along.""  
  
""Which... doesn't match Mr. Kingsley's timeline.""  
  
So Carter's miracle child‚Äîwasn't even his.  
  
If he found out, would he be disgusted?  
  
Would he still want the baby just because it's Vivienne's?  
  
I looked up at the investigator.  
  
""If I don't divorce him, my child still has inheritance rights, right?""  
  
""Of course,"" he said without hesitation.  
  
I pressed a hand to my belly.  
  
""And what if the baby's not his?""  
  
He blinked, visibly thrown.  
  
""Well... if you're married, he's still legally obligated to support the child. But‚Äî""  
  
I cut him off with a shake of my head.  
  
That was all I needed to hear.  
  
If Carter expected me to raise his child with Vivienne...  
  
Then why couldn't I let him raise a child that wasn't his?  
  
Chapter 3  
  
When I got home, Eleanor Kingsley was fussing over Vivienne like she was a princess.  
  
They both looked up the moment I walked in.  
  
Their smiles dropped.  
  
Carter frowned.  
  
""Didn't I tell you not to come back yet?""  
  
I chuckled.  
  
""You told me to come back early.""  
  
""Said you had something to talk about.""  
  
Carter hesitated.  
  
He clearly forgot.  
  
He cleared his throat.  
  
""Doesn't matter now.""  
  
""The annual family dinner‚ÄîVivienne's handling it this year.""  
  
Every year, I handled that dinner.  
  
Because I was the Kingsley family's official wife.  
  
It was my duty.  
  
Eleanor nitpicked everything I ever did for those dinners.  
  
The menu, the flowers, the lighting‚Äînothing was ever good enough.  
  
But at least it came with the title.  
  
Now that Vivienne was here, even that had been handed to her.  
  
I gave a tight-lipped smile.  
  
""Sure. It's your house, your call.""  
  
Carter frowned, like he expected me to fight back.  
  
Eleanor sniffed, pleased. ""At least you know your place.""  
  
She turned to Vivienne, her voice warm.  
  
""If you run into any trouble, just let me know, sweetheart.""  
  
Vivienne gave her a bashful smile, and Carter melted all over again.  
  
They launched into planning, forgetting I was still in the room.  
  
Laughing together.  
  
Ethan sat beside Vivienne, gently patting her belly.  
  
""This dinner's for my baby brother!""  
  
They looked like the perfect little family.  
  
And I‚Äî  
  
I was just background noise.  
  
I walked upstairs without another word.  
  
For days, I stayed out of sight.  
  
They loved it.  
  
Everyone was busy helping Vivienne plan the big event.  
  
But this wasn't her world.  
  
She got overwhelmed quickly.  
  
I overheard her one evening, curled up in Carter's arms.  
  
""I can't even get a stupid dinner right... I'm useless.""  
  
Carter held her tighter.  
  
""No, baby. You're doing great. It's your first time.""  
  
The next night, Carter knocked on my door.  
  
That alone was unusual.  
  
When I opened it, he didn't waste time.  
  
""Vivienne's overwhelmed.""  
  
""She's pregnant, and this dinner is a lot. Help her out.""  
  
I smiled.  
  
""When I handled my first dinner, I was eight months pregnant.""  
  
He looked surprised.  
  
Like he'd only just remembered that.  
  
Back then, I was on my feet every day, planning menus and centerpieces, weeks from giving birth.  
  
No one offered to help.  
  
No one cared.  
  
And now?  
  
A little guilt on his face didn't mean a damn thing.  
  
I cut him off before he could apologize.  
  
""I'll help with the background stuff.""  
  
'Let her handle the main event. She deserves to shine, right?""  
  
Carter blinked, clearly thrown.  
  
""You're really okay letting her take the spotlight?""  
  
After all, the dinner was always the First Lady's stage.  
  
And I was giving it up.  
  
""She is carrying the next Kingsley,"" I said calmly.  
  
Carter opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else.  
  
But I'd already closed the door.  
  
He stood there for a while.  
  
Maybe realizing I wasn't the woman who used to beg for his attention.  
  
Maybe realizing I didn't need him anymore.

We met online, talked for about three weeks and met up. The first date went extremely well. Met for coffee, then had lunch and moved to different public places. It lasted for six hours. We had so much fun and just kept laughing and laughing that I didn‚Äôt get to ask him all the important questions like what is it he is looking for. He later said it was the greatest first date and as if we had known each other for a long time, but he also said he was afraid he was being friend zoned because we were so goofy. He initiated a second date and we met again the next weekend. We had another blast. This time he was all over me physically. He invited himself to my apartment but I didn‚Äôt let him in and we had our first kiss in front of my door after he asked to kiss me. Two days later after not responding to my text he suddenly asked me if I wanted to have dinner that evening, to which I said yes. We had a short impromptu dinner date and again, I didn‚Äôt let him in to my apartment and we kissed some more in front of my door. He came to see me again for our fourth date the next weekend, and yet we had another unbelievably great time. This time I let him in to my apartment and we made out a lot.

All this time we had been texting each other a lot and he would sometimes call me too in between dates. He also called me beautiful and sweetheart in his texts and calls. But the day after we made out he was not as responsive to my texts, but suddenly called me that night saying that he had been thinking of me all day. We spoke for over 2 hours. At the end of the call, however, idk how it started but I brought up the topic of exclusivity, to which he said it‚Äôs a topic that we should be talking in person not over the phone. He also said he‚Äôs not seeing anyone else.

He said a lot of things on that call like how he wanted to kiss me while lifting me like in the movies. He also always talked a lot about future plans like we should and will do this and that together, even Christmas plans! And it‚Äôs still June. I thought he was interested in a relationship but then after that short convo about exclusivity I noticed a change of in his communication. He has not texted me as much (almost none), stopped calling me beautiful, and stopped texting good morning. I thought he had lost interest but I gave him the benefit of the doubt as he was going through some stressful situations. Four days went by with very little communication. After he shut me down with ‚Äúhave a good night‚Äù when I was trying to chat by text, I decided I was going to back off. A full day, Friday, went by without any text and suddenly he called me that night like nothing happened. He asked how I was doing and if I had any weekend plans. I said I had something to do with my friends on Sunday, that‚Äôs it. He didn‚Äôt ask me out again but said I should come down to his new place sometime. He just got a new place and would be moving in soon. He was driving so he ended the call early with ‚ÄúCall me sometime!‚Äù And we still have no plans for a fifth date.¬†

I wonder if I scared him away for bringing up exclusivity talk too soon. But he was sooo eager. I thought he wanted me to be his only one. The only reason I said it was because we were getting physical and I have a problem with that if he‚Äôs still seeing other women. I don‚Äôt want to come off as too eager as I don‚Äôt know much about this person yet either, but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to lose him yet. I want a long term relationship but idk where he‚Äôs at. Rn I just wish I had just played it cool and not mentioned exclusivity at all that soon. I want to back track and go back to where we were. I really want to see him again, but not sure if I should initiate it and show any eagerness, or if I should just withdraw and make him chase me again. I also thought of just being totally honest to him; apologize for putting him on the spot and tell him I want to keep my options open and go with the flow. But I‚Äôm afraid of bringing up this conversation again. What would be the best/safest next step for me?

Any advice on how to thread this water would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry it‚Äôs so long but I wanted to give as much context as possible. There are other questionable things like he made a joke after our great second date that he ‚Äúwas just in this for my hot bod‚Äù to which I was confused and confronted him nicely. He apologized and made it clear that he wanted ‚Äúsomething more‚Äù with me and not a hookup. But I‚Äôm still not sure up till now what he wants with me. We've had some serious conversations like about having kids, etc. though it was over the phone and he later said ‚Äúwe have to be careful not to talk about these casually by phone‚Äù.¬†

TLDR: Guy was pursuing me hot. Had the greatest four dates. We made out at my place. He called me the next day. After two hours talking I brought up exclusivity. He then stopped texting me as much and calling me pet names. But he called again after four days not to set up a date but telling me to call him sometime.

I have always loved homebrewing stuff for dnd so I have decided I am going to take the world from my game and put it into dnd. I will make it into a super awesome looking PDF using art from the actual game and things like that.

The style of sky ahoy will also translate to dnd very well as its a lot of sub stories where you are trying to recover these artifacts for instance an umbrella or a steam wand (like from a coffee machine) but I promise these items do cool things and there is a reason for them

What can you expect from it?  
There will (hopefully) be:  
\- Detailed descriptions off all of the islands

\- Artifacts (these are taken from my game but will basically be special magic items but you are limited to using 3 at a time like in the game)

\- Stat blocks for all enemies currently in the game (cool steampunk robots and stuff)

\- Info on all current NPCs

\- Weapons from the game including a gun on a stick

\- A walk though on how to play a version of what is in the demo but in dnd (yes I said demo there is a demo of my game sky ahoy on steam) 

\- A bunch of the world building and lore in detail so you can create your own stories within the world of sky ahoy

\- A ""steam"" system where steam can power tools and weapons 

I will post an update when I have all of this properly written out and another when it is released for you to check out. I hope people are actually interested in this and if not I will be playing it with my friends anyway.

1lbbjx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/theevilwithin/comments/1lbbjx9/save_room_mirror_creation_process/,Save Room Mirror Creation Process,"First I would like to thank everyone for their interest in my recreation of the save room mirror. It's a project I've wanted to make for a while and I'm glad I was finally able to pull it off and that it turned out as well as it did.

Some people have asked to see other props I've made and I will be sharing those here as well.

https://preview.redd.it/tc964lllqw6f1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1173840984030e1854b9d532b2401866faee582

First I purchased [this mirror](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09T6J1TYQ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) from Amazon. I had looked around quite a bit and this was the cheapest I could find that matched the look of the mirrors in game to a degree I was satisfied with.

https://preview.redd.it/rsdd97w4rw6f1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4d9439bf824766d305c0f2921f211797e4ee0424

It arrived with a small part of the frame chipped off at the top, but some epoxy and tape fixed it. I could've used clear epoxy but all I had at the time was grey. It's hardly noticeable in the final product. Just keep in mind if you plan on doing this project yourself that you might need to fix things like this. Thankfully this was the only damage done to the mirror in shipping.

https://preview.redd.it/4q7ub8ahrw6f1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a763ef86c39ae0de49566915c06a0739e63db237

Next was the scariest part of the project. I was really worried about not being able to control the direction of the cracks and ruining the mirror. I at first tried to use a 1/2"" spade bit to act as a chisel and tap the end with a hammer. Turns out mirrors are a lot harder to break than you would think. I eventually just hit the mirror with the hammer directly and it still took 6-7 swings before the hammer created a hole. Be sure to do this outside and wear gloves. You don't want tiny fragments of glass to get on you.

https://preview.redd.it/ymwsfwnytw6f1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ced595f97b8690f6aac2f48bd5a4571d627c3363

At this point the hole had exposed the cardboard backing plate that holds the mirror together with the frame. I removed the frame and all the pieces of the mirror were placed in a box and taken inside. I covered the backing plate with aluminum foil to retain the shiny mirror finish was some of the finish had been removed when the glass broke. I then arranged the pieces of the mirror to the best of my ability and secured them with the same grey epoxy I used to fix the frame.

https://preview.redd.it/6lj7k5xouw6f1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=60db2ec0940d63fef056b02b4c8c41dc01c0e944

After some more epoxy to reattach the fame it was time to cut a hole in the backing plate. I just used a basic utility knife to cut a sharp circular hole in the cardboard. Be sure to keep the hole smaller than 2"" or else the light will be too small to cover it.

https://preview.redd.it/v9ocajo4vw6f1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34b646f5a113bb444ba1232d282774050f99f82d

I used a lot of duct tape to hold everything together during the epoxy curing process and because the mirror will always be against the wall I left it as you wouldn't really see it anyways. I similarly used duct tape to secure [the LED spotlight](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJGDG7DV?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) over the hole and keep the wire in place. The spotlight causes the mirror to be uneven and not sit flush with the wall when mounted so I added a section of foam that's roughly the same thickness to offset the light and make it more stable.

https://preview.redd.it/pqq7czhmvw6f1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=818e028a9bf99ce3932a6618baf68f090e1f4d58

With the light secured in place it looks like this when off. Simply hang the mirror and you're finished.

Now for some bonus items that I think people here might enjoy. Not all of these are from The Evil Within but they are from various horror games. I'll see if anyone is able to guess what they're from.

I am debating between the Starlink Mini and Standard, and im only buying one system for both setups  

For just myself I have a very simple truck bed camper, and the only available power is a 1200Wh Jackery, with minimal ability to recharge. The truck doesn‚Äôt go out for trips longer than 4-5 days, and personally my internet requirements in the truck are emergency-only, at most a quick trail lookup in the middle of the desert. Not more than 1h a day. I do not work out of my truck, and if something came up for work while I‚Äôm out it would be rare enough that I‚Äôd be willing to find a coffee shop to work in for a few hours.

For the van, I have 800Ah of battery onboard, with 600W solar and DC-DC fast charge while driving. We might have 3 people surfing the internet simultaneously, or I‚Äôll sometimes work out of the van for 1+ month. For work I use Revit software and share files via OneDrive. We don‚Äôt work on shared files where I need to see updates in real time, but I do need to be able to upload and download 1GB+ files in a reasonable amount of time (reasonable for me is <5 min), and this might need to happen \~1x per hour during the workday. 

I like the idea of the higher upload/download speeds with the Standard, but the power consumption (or lack thereof) on the Mini is attractive. Price is a factor, but not a limitation, and I think the price difference between the two in negligible because the monthly plants cost the same regardless.  The weather resistance on the Standard is nice but not necessary - if the weather is too bad for the Mini I‚Äôd just not work right then, unless someone has found that weather is a big restriction on this (I see that the Standard is good up to 60mph winds, but I‚Äôm not sure what the Mini considers ‚Äòadverse weather‚Äô). I‚Äôll need to move it between both vehicle regardless of which one I get, so I‚Äôll have to take it down and put it back up every time (not sure what that involves and if it‚Äôs easier with the mini or the Standard). 

I think that‚Äôs about everything. If anyone has any experience uploading large files on the Mini, I think that‚Äôs my biggest hang up on not going that way, or if anyone has found weather to be hugely limiting. Thanks!",1,1749915278.0,Starlink,0,1.0,False

‚Äç

**Why This Pick?**

I‚Äôve gotta roll with Milwaukee. Starting pitcher Jose Quintana (2.66 ERA) has only allowed 4 runs across his last 4 outings, while Cardinals starter Andre Pallante (4.75 ERA) has allowed a whopping 15 runs across his last 4. With a substantially better starter and the home advantage, I think the Brewers find a comfortable win here.

So far my favorites are Jeni's Double Dough, that weird tang is addictive, Jeni's Sweet Cream, I love sweet cream, B & J Gimme S'mores, HD cookies & cream, & Helados Mexico. Honorable mention to Frollies! I'll be putting my ratings in the comments once I try the Mango sorbet bars, fruit loops, HD salted cookie, and McConnels ice cream. 


All my favorites are definitely 8's, 9's and 10's. IMO. Here's my ratings so far:


-  HD c&c 10/10
-  Helados 10/10 
-  JP Fudge pops 10/10
-  Talenti Mango 10/10
-  HD Chocolate 9/10

-  JP Cotton Candy pops 6/10



The cotton candy pops don't taste like Cotton Candy and every color had a different flavor which ended up tasting more fruity. The Fudge pops have a super creamy and almost dry finish which I really like. It's definitely a more mature fudge pop. 
I ended up buying a second double dough cause I ate the first already. I will definitely be a repeat customer of the top 8. ",14,1749915190.0,icecream,3,1.0,False
1lbbg15,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1lbbg15/undiagnosed_digestive_issues_or_loose_stools_for/,Undiagnosed digestive issues or loose stools for 15-17 years,"Hello everyone, 

I am a 38 year old caucasian male from New York (though I have lived in North Carolina for 3 years now). I have a long, strange health history that so far has left GI doctors in New York, North Carolina, and Cleveland stumped. At some point between 15 and 17 years ago (its hard to know since it started so mildly and gradually) I became experiencing chronic digestive symptoms. It started out as a mild, ""unsettled"" feeling after eating a large meal followed by lots of flatulence, but no pain or diarrhea. My bowel movement frequency very slowly increased from one per day to three per day, then four and occasionally even five (though I was eating about 4000 calories a day at the time). These were still formed, but messy. 

I am ashamed to admit, but I often got lazy and sore from the bowel movements, so I would often work at my computer late into the night with a bowel movement just sitting in my anus leaking out matter (I know, gross, but its vital to understanding what came next). It often got so bad that when I would use a bidet dried chunks would come off like dried mud. I would also shave the area for my girlfriend and it would bleed (even during these dirtier moments that she was thankfully unaware of). 

Anyway, this went on for years and suddenly I developed a perianal abscess which was lanced and the fistula from it was cut out. This was 12 years ago. I became hygienic and stopped doing that stuff and havent had any more problems with that area (knock on wood). However, the loose stools have gotten progressively worse. I can no longer tolerate fibrous foods or fatty foods. I have given up on ultraprocessed foods entirely and I cannoy tolerate coffee. 

Now, I know what you're thinking- Crohn's. However, over the past decade I have had two capsule endoscopies, two colonoscopies with biopsies of the terminal ileum and colon, FIVE fecal calproctectin tests, one upper endoscopy, one MRE, and countless other tests, all years apart and with different doctors and ALL normal except some mild nonspecific findings on upper endoscopy. They have told me that this nearly 100% rules out Crohn's (though without knowing its cause, I dont think you can say 100%, but maybe 99%). They think my abscess was caused by clogging of the anal crypts (which makes sense, given my atrocious previous habits).

Ive also had two or three basic fecal pathogen tests.

Anyway, the non-specific upper endoscopy findings were partial and mild villous blunting in the duodenum and mild, inactive gastritis...as well as bad GERD but I already knew that. I do NOT have celiac disease, as gluten free diet does nothing (in fact, sourdough bread seems to help my symptoms) and my serology was negative. 

They have all finally thrown up their hands and said I have ""IBS"", which is a waste basket diagnosis thst doesnt really mean anything. 

Anyway, I have been managing well with a restricted diet and high dose loperamide. It allows me to live and work normally. But not being able to eat most fruits, vegetables, salads, beans, spicy foods, fried foods, etc. has really become annoying. 

I have traveled a lot over the years, but the only notable possible cause I can think if is that, I got lost in the rainforest in Costa Rica back in 2008 and had to drink a lot of water from a waterfall. I was tested for giardia and all other common pathogens but....what about tropical sprue? I have the partial non-celiac villous blunting. Is anyone familiar with this illness? Any and all recommendations are appreciated. Ive gone to SEVEN GI doctors and they have essentially given up. ",1,1749915122.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Despite having a shaky outing yesterday, Gausman still managed to bag 6 strikeouts. Variance in pitchers is always so interesting ‚Äì last year, Gausman was an absolute Ace on the road. This year, he's... well... \*ahem\* not so much! üòÇ

1lbbawq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaturatedFat/comments/1lbbawq/4months_strict_hclf_plantbased_update/,4-months strict HCLF plant-based update,"Quick recap: After trying a number of diets, covered in previous posts, I was dealing with borderline pre-diabetes, post-prandial hyperglycemia, poor phase 1 insulin response, and high cholesterol (high risk ApoB and small LDL particles). The only diet that I hadn't tried was HCLF.

I started following the 'Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease Diet' beginning of February, after having bloodwork done at the end of January, while following a very low-PUFA ""swampy, lower carb-ish"" diet. I just had bloodwork taken at the beginning of June, and the results are:

A1C: 5.3 (from 5.6)

Cholesterol Total: 108 (from 278)

LDL: 47 (from 181)

HDL: 44 (from 81)

Trigs: 86 (from 64)

In addition to the diet changes, I also increased my walking from 10-15 minutes after every meal to \~25 minutes post-meal. \~12K steps per day, and some days as high as 15K. Hurt my hip recently, so walking a bit less.

During this time I've lost about 15 lbs. Starting weight \~162, CW: 147.

At the beginning I was struggling to eat enough calories, but now am up to 2500/day. Could probably still add a few more. I wasn't tracking weight precisely, but the loss seemed steady, and not related to the initial low-calorie period. TBH, seemed like I lost more weight as I added more calories.

In terms of blood sugar, previously it wasn't uncommon to see post-meal readings of 170, 180, 200, and that was with a walk, and a sharp spike.

Now, unless I am in a very stressed-out state, it is rare to see readings above 160, and and much more gradual slopes - and this is with 400-500g of carbs per day.

In terms of meals, I cook all my meals, aiming for lots of veggies, in addition to grains. Tip to add calories (and some resistant starch) is adding cooked and cooled potatoes to my oatmeal at breakfast, and potatoes to my barley at dinner.

After trying a few different meals, I've settled on largely the same breakfast, lunch, dinner, for \~90% of the past 2 months. (Cronometer for a typical day attached)

We need help finishing our living area. Our tv sits on a west elm mcm console - I don‚Äôt want to get the matching coffee table.

I‚Äôd like it to be somewhat unusual but not precious, and if it had storage, that would be great. I‚Äôve considered a round gold drum coffee table, and a gold pedestal table with a glass top. I also like the idea of a natural stone element, but am having a hard time finding something that‚Äôs not $2000 or partially wood. Any other ideas? 

Next, I‚Äôm looking for paint and rug suggestions. Ideally our color palette in this room will be cream, mustard, terracotta, and dark green. But, I‚Äôm rethinking the green accent wall. Our entire living, dining, and kitchen area is one room, so it was a way to bring in some color, but I can‚Äôt have the entire space be green. It‚Äôs too dark for me. Thoughts? I‚Äôve attached a rug inspiration picture, but again, I am open to suggestions. 

We do plan to reface the fireplace and swap out the fan for another fixture as well, but I haven‚Äôt given either much thought lately. I feel like we need the rug, paint color, and coffee table first.

this time I‚Äôm taking a slightly different approach. my short-term goal is 10 days, then I‚Äôll scan, weigh, and reassess before moving forward to 21, 30, and potentially 42 days. if things continue to go well, I‚Äôve got my eye on 52 as a personal milestone i‚Äôve always wanted to hit‚Ä¶bit don‚Äôt want to get ahead of myself lol, so we‚Äôll see.

i know it‚Äôs not purist, but i‚Äôve experimented with this before during shorter fasts and it‚Äôs working for me, keeping hunger low, energy high, and my mindset grounded. i‚Äôm at the gym 5x a week for 2+ hours, so i‚Äôve been balancing this protocol carefully to preserve muscle and performance while staying in fat-burning, autophagy-promoting territory.

It got so bad that her father had to borrow money from so many people just so the family could stay afloat. In the end, Violet‚Äôs father had to sell their three-story home, all their cars and assets.....","# 1. VIOLET

Good morning, beautiful girl! Violet Carvey heard her mom‚Äôs chirpy voice as soon as she entered the kitchen. Her mom, Barbara, was standing over the cramped kitchen counter in their small apartment, fixing a nice tuna sandwich and putting it inside a brown bag. Good morning, mom. What are you doing?‚Äù Violet replied. I‚Äôm packing you lunch for school, Mom, I‚Äôm not in school anymore. I‚Äôve graduated last month, Oh,‚Äù Barbara stopped whatever she was doing immediately. She didn‚Äôt remember that her beautiful daughter was already 18 and a high school graduate. It‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll take it anyway,‚Äù Violet said sweetly. She felt bad about it and grabbed the brown paper bag, stuffing it inside her backpack. ‚ÄúThanks, mom,‚Äù You‚Äôre welcome,‚Äù Barbara smiled. ‚ÄúBy the way, what is Dylan doing in the house? Shouldn‚Äôt he be in New York right now? Mom, Dylan‚Äôs dropped out from college,‚Äù Violet explained patiently. He did?‚Äù Barbara gasped in shock like this was the first time she heard it. ‚ÄúWhy? Violet let out a sigh. This was not the first time she had to explain to her mom about the things going on around the house. Ever since Barbara got diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs last year, her memory and health had been deteriorating. Barbara stopped working entirely and Violet‚Äôs older brother, Dylan, even dropped out of college and moved back home so he could help them out. No reason, he just doesn't think school‚Äôs for him,‚Äù Violet lied. She knew her mom would feel bad if she told her the real reason. The Carvey family had been struggling financially for the past several years, especially since Violet‚Äôs father died. Life hadn‚Äôt always been this difficult for them, especially when Violet was young. She was actually born into a middle-upper class family. James Carvey was a successful businessman in a small town in New Jersey. Violet and Dylan enjoyed a wonderful lifestyle growing up, but everything changed when Violet was thirteen years old. Her father wanted to expand his business, and he made a bad business deal with some powerful people in Italy. These people ended up bankrupting her father‚Äôs business. It got so bad that her father had to borrow money from so many people just so the family could stay afloat. In the end, Violet‚Äôs father had to sell their three-story home, all their cars and assets, and they moved into a small rental apartment in Newark. It didn‚Äôt help that James fell ill and he couldn‚Äôt work to support his family. Barbara had to step up and work at the factories. And finally, James Carvey couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. One day, he said he was going to the store, but he ended up crashing the car down the cliff on the highway. He died leaving his family with a mountain of debt and some insurance money.

As soon as Violet turned fourteen, she started working at ice cream stores or coffee shops to help out the family. Dylan, who was two years older, started working at a local bar owned by their father‚Äôs old friend, The Union. Once Dylan turned 18, he got a scholarship to study at Fordham. Barbara was so happy for him and he promised that he‚Äôd get a good education so their family could go back to the way it was. Unfortunately, only two years later, Barbara‚Äôs health began to decline with Alzheimer's. Violet was still a senior in high school. Dylan knew it was his responsibility as the oldest son to go back and help his family, so he dropped out of Fordham and returned to Newark. He got his old job back at The Union, except he also did many other side hustles, the kind of work that Violet would never mention to her mom.

‚ÄúOh, so that‚Äôs why Dylan‚Äôs been around the house lately,‚Äù Barbara nodded her head.

‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôs dropped out since last year, mom. He‚Äôs been around ever since,‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ I see‚Ä¶‚Äù Barbara said. Violet smiled sweetly, but she knew she would have to explain this again tomorrow morning.

‚ÄúAnyway, I gotta go to work. Call me if you need anything or check the post-its if you forget something,‚Äù Violet said as she grabbed her things from the kitchen counter.

‚ÄúOkay, dear. Have fun at work,‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you, mom,‚Äù

‚ÄúLove you too, sweet girl,‚Äù

Barbara kissed her daughter‚Äôs cheek and Violet made her way to the door. She checked her reflection in the mirror for two seconds before she headed out. Her dark brown hair was long, her face was pale, but her purple-blue eyes were shining bright. If she had more time in the morning, she would‚Äôve put on some make up, but there was no time for pleasantries. Her shift at the local coffee shop starts in fifteen minutes and she should be out the door by now. So without a second thought, Violet shrugged and left the house.

Walking out of the house, Violet quickly raced to the bus stop and she managed to catch the incoming bus going downtown. After a ten minute ride later, she arrived at her stop and made her way to the coffee shop. Within minutes, Violet already got her apron on and she was manning the register at the coffee shop.

‚ÄúWelcome to City Coffee, what can I get you today?‚Äù Violet greeted her first customer of the day. This was a line she had spoken so many times in her life, it came out like a reflex. She didn‚Äôt even have to look up from the register, she‚Äôd just hear their order, punch it in, and quickly make the drink.

‚ÄúViolet? Violet Carvey?‚Äù the girl standing in front of her said. Violet looked up from the register and saw a familiar face. It was a girl about her age and she might‚Äôve seen this girl around school before.

‚ÄúOh, hey. You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ Nicole, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, we took AP Calc together!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, how are you?‚Äù Violet smiled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good. I‚Äôm with Hanson and Ashley. You remember them?‚Äù Nicole turned to the glass windows and waved at her friends standing outside. ‚ÄúGuys, look, it‚Äôs Violet! Our Valedictorian!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yeah,‚Äù Violet laughed nervously and waved at the people outside. They were waving at her and mouthing ‚Äòhi‚Äô.

‚ÄúI go here all the time, I didn‚Äôt know you work here,‚Äù Nicole said.

‚ÄúOnly almost every day,‚Äù Violet turned her eyes back to the register. ‚ÄúSo what can I get you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAn iced latte please,‚Äù

‚ÄúComing right up,‚Äù

Violet punched the order and turned to the coffee station. Her hands were skillfully working the coffee machine. She loved the smell of freshly ground coffee and she found making coffees to be a therapeutic act. She‚Äôd prefer if people didn't talk to her when she was making them, but Nicole didn‚Äôt know that. She was too excited to run into a high school friend, so she kept chatting.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that high school‚Äôs already over. Can you?‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúTime sure flies,‚Äù Violet replied shortly.

‚ÄúI know, I‚Äôm excited about college though. I‚Äôm going to Georgetown,‚Äù

‚ÄúGeorgetown‚Äôs a great school, congratulations,‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks. And I heard you got a full-ride scholarship to Harvard. Is that true?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so cool! When are you leaving?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to Harvard,‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Nicole squeaked so loud, people nearby turned their heads to her.

‚ÄúI had to turn it down,‚Äù Violet shrugged simply.

‚ÄúYou turned down a full-ride scholarship to Harvard?!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I wish I could go, but I can‚Äôt be too far away from New Jersey right now. My mom needs me,‚Äù she gave Nicole a weak smile and turned back to the coffee she was making.

‚ÄúAw. You‚Äôre such a good person, Vi,‚Äù Nicole pouted and sighed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I could do that if I were you,‚Äù

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your ice latte. That‚Äôll be 3.75,‚Äù Violet put the drink on the counter.

‚ÄúHere you go, keep the change,‚Äù Nicole handed her a five dollar bill.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù

Nicole took the drink and smiled. Violet smiled politely back and turned her attention to the next customer. Nicole took the hint and she headed outside.

‚ÄúHi, welcome to City Coffee, what can I get you?‚Äù

Violet‚Äôs shift at the coffee shop ended at around 5 PM. She was tired from standing around all day, but the day wasn‚Äôt over yet. She took a quick dinner break before jumping into another bus, this time it was heading to The Union in Jersey City.

Ever since she graduated high school and she wasn‚Äôt going to college, Violet thought about filling her time with as much work as she could. Not only that her mother needed money for treatment, but the Carvey family still owed a lot of money to a lot of people. She had to do her part to help chip in any way she could.

Violet arrived at The Union just before 7 o‚Äôclock. The Union was a fancy western saloon-style bar that had been around in the neighborhood since the 1980‚Äôs. The owner, Danny, was a good friend of Violet‚Äôs dad because they grew up together in high school. Danny felt bad about what happened to James, so when James‚Äôs son and daughter asked for a job at his bar, he allowed them to work and paid them a little extra sometimes.

Violet started working as a waitress there a few months ago. Danny noticed right away that she was a smart girl. She was also a skilled barista, and once she started watching the bartenders mixing drinks, it didn‚Äôt take long before she ended up picking up that skill as well. Violet preferred working as a bartender than as a waitress. Sometimes the guys in the bar would get drunk and handsy and they‚Äôd put their hands on her miniskirt. That never sat well with her, especially when Dylan was around, he would start a fight over it. But being the bartender, Violet felt a lot safer because she was always behind the bar. No one could touch her there. She‚Äôd make less money in tips, but the peace of mind was priceless.

Dylan was always around the bar a lot as he was now promoted as the bar manager by Danny. Working under Danny was great, but Dylan was always looking for ways to make more money. Violet noticed that Dylan would sometimes do shady deals in the VIP section. He‚Äôd find girls or drugs for the VIP customers. One time he even got a guy a gun. Dylan never wanted to talk about his backdoor activities with Violet, so whenever she asked about it, he always shrugged it off and told her it‚Äôs better if she doesn‚Äôt know.

‚ÄúWhy are you dressed so extra today? It‚Äôs like you're applying for a job at a bank,‚Äù Violet commented as she saw Dylan walking out of the manager‚Äôs office in a suit and tie. Normally, her brother would only wear jeans and a black t-shirt. His long dark hair was always messy and unkempt, but he made an effort to comb them today.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you hear? We got special guests coming tonight,‚Äù Dylan played with his eyebrows and leaned against the bar counter.

‚ÄúWatch it, I just cleaned the bar,‚Äù Violet shoved him away.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he muttered and took out a cigarette from his pocket.

‚ÄúAnd what special guests? Those basketball guys? Or that rapper Ice-T?‚Äù Violet said as she wiped the bar again.

‚ÄúNope, not athletes and rappers,‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe mafia,‚Äù

Violet‚Äôs eyes shot up instinctively. She thought Dylan must be joking, but his expression was dead serious. He took a long drag of his cigarette before blowing the smoke away, in the direction opposite of Violet.

‚ÄúWhat mafia?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúThe Van Zandt family,‚Äù Dylan whispered lowly so that only she could hear him. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming tonight, and they‚Äôve got the whole VIP section booked,‚Äù

Much like everyone who had grown up in New Jersey, Violet had heard about the Van Zandt clan like it was a folklore story. They were the biggest mobster group in New Jersey since the Luciano family. The leader, Damon Van Zandt, took over the leadership after Joe Luciano died five years ago.

Violet had heard many stories, most of them weren‚Äôt great, but she never saw these people in real life. She never had a reason to. Her life was mostly peaceful and idyllic. She spent all her days at school, working at the coffee shop, and she‚Äôd go to church on Sundays. It was only recently that she started working at The Union, and so far the only famous people that came here were rap stars or athletes.

Suddenly, as if on cue, the front door flew open and a group of men in black suits appeared. Violet turned her head instantly. She noticed the atmosphere in the air shifted as this group of guys entered the room. Dylan quickly put out his cigarette and started walking to the door to greet the men.

One of the men stood out from the rest. He was standing in the very middle. He was tall, tan-skinned, dark haired, and tattoos were peeking out of his expensive three-piece suit. Violet found herself gazing at this mysterious figure. His eyes were dark and unreadable, but his gaze was sharp, sharper than that killer jawline.

And that was the first time Violet saw him in person, the devil in the flesh, Damon Van Zandt.

# 2. DAMON

‚ÄúGood morning, Mr. Van Zandt,‚Äù

Damon looked up to see his consigliere greeting him at the door to his study. Consigliere is another word for advisor, most notably to a crime boss such as Damon himself. His consigliere‚Äôs name is Adrian Luciano. He was the nephew to the famed mob king Joe ‚ÄúJoseph‚Äù Luciano who was the head of the New Jersey underworld from the 1980s up to now when Damon took over. Adrian, being a Luciano himself, had more claim to the throne over Damon who was only an orphan when Joe Luciano took him in. But Adrian never wanted the throne. Adrian preferred a more peaceful lifestyle with his wife Talia. So when Damon was willing to take over the throne, Adrian was more than happy to help him. They grew up together and Adrian knew there was no one more fitting to be king than Damon Van Zandt.

Damon was not born into the Luciano family, in fact, he never even met his real family. When he was only a baby, his mother left him on the footsteps of a Catholic church with only a blanket and his name. He was raised as an orphan at the church before he was put in foster care as a young kid. He moved from home to home before finally, at the age of fourteen, Damon met Joseph Luciano who soon became a father figure to him.

Damon was first raised to be a trained assassin. He was agile, quick, and cunning. He killed his first man at the age of fifteen, and the man was twice his age and size. Damon soon became Joseph‚Äôs favorite killing machine. He would do everything Joseph told him to, no questions asked. But after some time had passed, killing became a boring chore for the quick-witted Damon. Joseph saw this too. Damon had the potential for leadership and politics, so Joseph started grooming him to become his successor. It worked out pretty well as Joseph never had a son of his own. He had one daughter though, a beautiful girl named Isabella.

Isabella was the first girl Damon ever really loved. She had long dark hair and purple-blue eyes. Damon loved everything about her, the way she speaks, the way she dances, and most of all, he loved her heart. In a world as cruel and dark as the mafia underground, Isabella was a ray of light and hope for him.

After pursuing Isabella for years, at the age of nineteen, Isabella finally said yes to marrying Damon. His wedding day was the happiest day of his life. Joseph even arranged the biggest wedding party New Jersey had ever known. But on the day of the wedding, when everyone was drunk and high on love, a rival gang, the Maranzano family, appeared out of nowhere and started opening fire. Joseph was killed on the spot, and so was Damon‚Äôs beautiful bride.

It was the most gruesome sight Damon had ever seen. The happiest day of his life had turned into the worst. They managed to kill almost all of the Maranzano guys that crashed the wedding, but that was nothing compared to their losses. They lost their king, Joseph, and the princess, Isabella. And as for Damon, he lost everything he ever held dear.

Ever since that day, Damon took over the post as the king and he vowed to avenge Joseph and Isabella‚Äôs death. He also made another vow, he would never fall in love again. Love was a weakness and there was no room for weakness when you live in a world like his.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre finished with that paperwork, your presence is required downstairs, your grace,‚Äù Adrian said again.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to be funny, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Damon scoffed and closed the stack of files on his desk.

‚ÄúCalling you ‚Äòboss‚Äô is a cliche, don‚Äôt you think? I‚Äôm trying to be more creative here,‚Äù Adrian replied.

‚ÄúF√∫ck off, Adrian,‚Äù

‚ÄúI will, I‚Äôm just supposed to let you know that everything‚Äôs ready. They‚Äôre waiting for you,‚Äù

Damon knew exactly what that meant. He buttoned his suit and stood up from his chair. With a menacing grin playing on his face, Damon strode out of the study and headed to the basement. Adrian was following close behind him, but he didn‚Äôt go into the basement. Damon was going into battle and the advisor wasn‚Äôt needed on the battlefield. Adrian stayed outside and he was pacing nervously.

Damon pushed the metal doors behind the wooden door to the room in the basement. This was a special room built under the estate that resembled a war bunker. It was a room meant for protection, but ever since he took over, Damon turned the room into a torture chamber for his enemies. And today, the room was housing two Maranzano boys that Damon‚Äôs guys picked up last night.

‚ÄúBoss,‚Äù Liam, Damon‚Äôs number one right hand man greeted him.

Damon nodded at Liam and Liam pulled the black fabric covering the two Maranzano guys‚Äô heads. They were both tied to a chair, their faces bruised and swollen, and so were their kneecaps.

‚Äú...P-please, Damon, please‚Ä¶‚Äù the guy on the left said. ‚ÄúIt was my cousin‚Äôs idea. We had nothing to do with it,‚Äù

‚ÄúDamon, it was five years ago. A lot of things had changed since then. We even gave up a lot of our New York territories to you,‚Äù the guy on the right said.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt give it up, I took them,‚Äù Damon said curtly. He started pacing around the two guys and the one on the left closed his eyes in fear. He even smelled like pee as he had probably pissed himself last night.

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre right, five years is a long time. I should probably let it go,‚Äù Damon said to the guy on the right. He swallowed hard and waited for Damon to continue. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, five years is not a long enough time for a vendetta,‚Äù

The two guys shuddered in fear as Damon took out a gun from his holster. Damon clicked the safety off and pointed the mouth between the two guys.

‚ÄúD--Damon, please,‚Äù the one on the left begged.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre only gonna prolong this war,‚Äù the one on the right said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs already enough innocent blood being shed,‚Äù

Damon ignored their pleas and turned to Liam instead.

‚ÄúHow many mouths do I need to send a message?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúJust one,‚Äù Liam replied.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I thought,‚Äù

* BANG! \*

Without wasting another second, Damon had pulled the trigger. He didn‚Äôt even need to look and he shot his target straight in the head. The guy on the right went limp as there was a clear bullet hole on his forehead.

‚ÄúYou can send the message,‚Äù Damon said to the guy on the left who was shaking through and through. ‚ÄúDamon Van Zandt does not forget,‚Äù

Damon tried wiping the blood on his cuffs, but it was no use. There was too much splatter and now his suit was ruined. He climbed up the stairs in annoyance and found Adrian waiting for him at the door.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done,‚Äù Damon announced.

‚ÄúThat was fast,‚Äù Adrian followed as Damon kept walking.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even afternoon yet and I‚Äôve already ruined my suit,‚Äù Damon sighed.

‚ÄúFor someone who‚Äôs not Italian, you speak like a true Italian,‚Äù Adrian chuckled. ‚ÄúHe just killed a man but he‚Äôs worried about his suit,‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat can I say? Death is just a natural human process. Right, Adrian?‚Äù Damon shot Adrian a knowing look.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Adrian‚Äôs smiled turned flat.

Damon stopped at the door to his study and Adrian stopped as well. Adrian opened his mouth and it looked like he was going to say something, but he wasn‚Äôt fast enough.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking a quick break. Send my number one in,‚Äù Damon said quickly. He didn‚Äôt wait for Adrian to answer and he just left, disappearing back into his study.

As soon as he was inside, Damon let out a long sigh and took off his bloody suit and shirt. His toned body was all muscles and there were marks and cuts all over. These were battle scars that he‚Äôd accumulated all these years.

Damon made his way to the desk and stared at the stack of files before him. He was obsessed with eliminating the Maranzano family, which was the biggest mafia family in New York and a long-time enemy to the Luciano family. The files in front of him contained data of the Maranzano businesses as well as their key players. The two guys downstairs were only pieces of pawns to his chess set. Damon only needed them to send a message to their king, Victor Maranzano, that his family‚Äôs glory days are coming to an end.

* Knock \* Knock \*

The knocking sound pulled Damon from his thoughts and he looked up at the door. The door creaked open and a woman walked in. She was Sabrina, Damon‚Äôs number one female companion of the week. Ever since Isabella, Damon never gave his heart to anyone else and girls were only the means to an end.

Sabrina was young and eager to please. She was wearing her sexy latex uniform that revealed very little to the imagination. A playful smile stretched on her face as she strode over to Damon‚Äôs desk.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for your call all day,‚Äù she whispered seductively.

‚ÄúGot some business to take care of in the morning,‚Äù Damon said as he got up.

‚ÄúI heard,‚Äù Sabrina stood right in front of him and put her hands on his broad chest. ‚ÄùYou‚Äôve been working so hard, master. Let me take care of you for a change,‚Äù

Sabrina pushed Damon until he sat back down on the chair. The smile on her face was growing larger as she climbed on top of him. Her lips were aimed for his neck and Damon‚Äôs hand slowly reached up to her neck.

‚ÄúYou,‚Äù Damon hissed as his hand choked the girl‚Äôs neck. She gasped in shock as she couldn‚Äôt breathe. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt tell me what to do,‚Äù he ordered and she nodded her head.

Damon released his hand and Sabrina staggered back. Her hands went to her neck which was now bruised and blue.

‚ÄúGet on your f√∫cking knees,‚Äù

Damon stood up and undid his belt. Swallowing hard, Sabrina quickly obeyed her master. It was her first week being Damon‚Äôs number one as he got bored of his previous number one. Damon usually never spent more than a couple of weeks with the same girl, but Sabrina was determined to make a difference. She came from the rougher part of town and being the mafia king‚Äôs number one girl was the best thing she could aspire for.

* SMACK! \*

The sound of Damon‚Äôs leather belt connecting with her skin sent shivers up and down her spine.

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù she screamed in pain, but that only made him rougher and he struck her harder.

* SMACK! \*
* SMACK! \*
* SMACK! \*

When the afternoon was done and the sun had set over the city, Damon knew it was time for another night of work. Tonight, he and his boys were visiting a local bar in Jersey City called The Union to make deals with other families around the area. Damon had to make sure he was able to keep the peace inside his own territory if he were to make war with the nearby Maranzano family.

The night started out like any other night. After leaving a torn-up Sabrina on the floor of his study, Damon put on a fresh new suit and headed out the door. Outside the estate, three black SUVs were already parked and waiting for him. Liam and his boys were in the first car, the last car was filled with bodyguards, and the second one was for him and Adrian.

Adrian kissed his wife, Talia, goodbye before following Damon into the car. Talia waved her hand and smiled, both at Damon and at her husband. Damon replied with a curt wave as the cars drove out of the gates.

After about twenty minutes of driving, the cars pulled up in front of The Union. After making sure that the place was good, Damon got out of the car and walked into the building. Liam and his other bodyguards were already ahead of him. Liam whispered something in the bar manager‚Äôs ear and within the next five minutes, everyone who wasn‚Äôt necessary was leaving the premises, including the waitresses and bartenders.

Damon sat in the VIP section with his boys as they waited for the arrival of the other families. The bar was now almost empty except for the manager, and there was one female bartender still at the bar.

‚ÄúWhat happened? Where‚Äôs everyone going?‚Äù the girl asked.

‚ÄúWe need everybody out. This is an official Van Zandt business. You too Vi, you gotta go,‚Äù the manager said.

‚ÄúWhat? I thought I was gonna ride home with you,‚Äù

‚ÄúNot tonight, here you can take my car, I‚Äôll find a way home,‚Äù the manager gave her his car key and she took it reluctantly.

‚ÄúDylan?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, just go,‚Äù he ordered.

Damon leaned over and whispered something in Liam‚Äôs ear. Liam then stood up and walked closer to the bar.

‚ÄúDylan!‚Äù he yelled.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù the manager turned back.

‚ÄúThe boss wants your best scotch,‚Äù Liam said.

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll go get it,‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, we need you in there. Have the girl bring it,‚Äù

Liam didn‚Äôt wait for Dylan to respond and he already turned back to the VIP section. The girl and the manager exchanged a worried look.

‚ÄúJust get the drink, give it to him, and you go straight home. You understand?‚Äù the manager hissed.

The girl quickly nodded her head.

Dylan was now joining the Van Zandt army at the VIP section. Liam was telling him what to do and what to expect once all the families were gathered. Meanwhile, Damon‚Äôs eyes traveled back to the bar and he found himself watching the girl. She was grabbing a bottle of scotch and several glasses before bringing them over to their table. Damon watched as the girl came closer and closer to his view. She had long brown hair and eyes as blue as the ocean with just a hint of purple. Her skin was smooth like porcelain and her cheeks turned a slight hint of pink as soon as she saw him watching her.

And that was the first time Damon saw her in person, the angel in the flesh, Violet Rose Carvey.

My partner and I (both in our early 30s) have recently been looking to expand our circle and connect with some new, like-minded people in and around the Thane/Mumbai area. We‚Äôre really just looking to meet good-hearted people who enjoy similar vibes and are open to meaningful friendships!

A bit about us:

We‚Äôre big on music! Always up for discovering new tunes, catching live gigs (we recently went to a Coldplay concert ‚Äì absolutely magical), or just having a lazy day with some great playlists on. Our taste ranges from classic rock and hip hop to house, electronica, and some golden-era Hindi tracks.

We love checking out new spots, from cozy caf√©s and hidden local joints to fancier restaurants. Big fans of Thai, Indian, Japanese, and Italian food!

Board game nights are our thing! Whether it‚Äôs Uno, Monopoly, Cards Against Humanity, or anything else fun, we‚Äôre always game!

Love to travel, whether it's weekend trips around Mumbai or somewhere in India or holidays abroad. We love exploring new places, cultures, and of course, trying local food.

Into running and gym workouts, and we‚Äôre now trying to dabble in yoga, calisthenics also

We adore dogs and we be handing out noose boops and belly rubs (and treats!).

Anyway, we're both super chill, always down for good coffee, drinks, or just an evening with fun conversation.

If this sounds like your kind of hangout vibe, drop a message! Would love to meet more people and make some genuine friendships (Only platonic - anything else will be blocked) üòä",2,1749914237.0,mumbaimeetups,0,0.75,False

The food landscape on June 14, 2025, offered a blend of practical advice for navigating the summer heat, a spotlight on the benefits of black coffee, and a glimpse into the exciting world of new culinary content. Consumers were encouraged to prioritize health-conscious choices, while the media explored emerging trends in cooking and eating.

**Cooling Down: Breakfast and Hydration in the Summer Heat**

With summer in full swing, the focus on staying cool and hydrated dominated the morning food discourse. The recurring theme across reports highlighted the importance of making smart dietary choices to combat the heat and maintain energy levels. Advice centered around the need to adapt morning routines to the season.

A key takeaway from the food news emphasized the importance of a cooling breakfast. ""Heavy, greasy breakfasts can cause bloating, sluggishness, and indigestion,"" advised Edwina Raj, a clinical nutritionist and dietician at Aster CMI Hospital. Her recommendation was to prioritize lighter, more soothing breakfast options to kickstart the day feeling refreshed and energized. The reports explicitly linked the feeling of dehydration and low energy often experienced in the summer with inappropriate breakfast choices, urging readers to break their fast in a way that cools the stomach. The repeated emphasis on ""cooling the stomach"" suggests a cultural or regional focus on specific food preparation or ingredients suitable for hot weather. One specific suggestion for combating the heat was to consider a coconut water smoothie, which offers a refreshing way to start the day.

**Black Coffee: Unveiling Health Benefits and Considerations**

Beyond the immediate impact of the summer heat, the news also highlighted the merits of black coffee and its potential health benefits. According to Dr. Pranav Honnavara Srinivasan, senior consultant gastroenterologist at Fortis Bengaluru, daily consumption of black coffee can lead to several health benefits due to the high content of antioxidants, caffeine, and B vitamins. He emphasized the immediate impact of black coffee on mental alertness, highlighting how caffeine works to stimulate the central nervous system by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain, which, in turn, increases the production of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine.

Dr. Srinivasan also noted that caffeine increases adrenaline levels in the bloodstream, which can enhance physical performance by preparing the body for exertion. The focus on the specific physiological effects of coffee suggests an attempt to provide factual information as the consumption of coffee is widespread.

**Culinary Inspiration and Emerging Trends**

Beyond daily consumption, the food scene also showed potential for culinary inspiration through the latest trends. The reports promoted various culinary platforms, aiming to offer innovative and practical cooking solutions.

The Guardian's Feast app was promoted as a valuable tool for home cooks. The app, packed with over 5,000 recipes, offered an easy-to-use, pocket-sized cookbook. It included features like cook mode, search by ingredient, and a save-for-later option. This emphasis suggests a growing demand for accessible and convenient cooking solutions.

Alongside the promotion of the app, the news featured a new season of ‚ÄúComfort Eating,‚Äù which invited viewers to look at food in a different light. This highlights a continuing trend where food isn‚Äôt just for sustaining life, but also for pleasure.

**Market Concerns: Adulteration in the Food Supply**

A less palatable piece of information included news of food adulteration, with a focus on ‚Äúfake paneer‚Äù and adulterated coffee circulating in the market. This information acts as a warning to consumers to remain vigilant about the source and quality of the products they purchase.

**Overall Tone and Implications**

The combined news coverage highlights a health-conscious approach to food, with an emphasis on the choices that promote well-being, particularly in the context of summer. The news presents an objective look at some food choices, while also providing information about the latest trends.

1lbaxvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/1lbaxvs/networking_101_practical_networking_on_youtube/,Networking 101. Practical Networking on Youtube,"# Networking Fundamentals: Hosts, IP Addresses, and Networks

This lesson serves as the first part of a module on networking fundamentals, focusing on how data flows through the internet by understanding the various devices involved. This video covers **hosts**, **IP addresses**, and **networks**.

# 1. Hosts

**Definition:** A **host** is any device that sends or receives network traffic.

**Examples of Hosts:**

* **Traditional Devices:** Computers, laptops, phones, printers, and servers.
* **Cloud Resources:** Cloud servers (reflecting the shift towards cloud computing).
* **Internet of Things (IoT) Devices:** Smart TVs, synchronized speakers, smartwatches, remotely controlled thermostats, smart refrigerators, and any other household device that sends or receives data.

**Importance:** All hosts, regardless of their type, follow the same fundamental rules for communicating over the internet. Understanding these rules for one host helps explain how all other devices interact with the internet.

# Client-Server Model

Hosts typically fall into one of two categories based on their role in a communication:

* **Clients:** These are the hosts that **initiate** a request.
* **Servers:** These are the hosts that **respond** to requests.

**Example Scenario:**

* Imagine a user's computer (Client) requests a webpage from `www.site.com`.
   * The user's computer **initiates** the request, so it's the **client**.
   * The web server for [`site.com`](http://site.com) **responds** by providing the webpage, so it's the **server**.

**Relativity of Client and Server Roles:** It's crucial to understand that the terms client and server are **relative to a specific communication**. A device can be a server in one interaction and a client in another.

* **Example 1: Web Server Updating Files**
   * The web server (which was a server when serving web pages to a client) might need to update its content from a file server.
   * In this communication, the web server **initiates** the request for new files, making it the **client**.
   * The file server **responds** with the files, making it the **server**.
* **Example 2: File Server Running Software Updates**
   * The file server might need to download software updates from an update server.
   * In this communication, the file server **initiates** the request for updates, acting as the **client**.
   * The update server **provides** the updates, acting as the **server**.

**What is a Server?** A server is essentially a **computer with specialized software installed** that knows how to respond to specific types of requests.

* A web server is just a computer with software designed to serve web pages.
* A file server is a computer with software for providing files.
* An update server is a computer with software for distributing updates. Any device can be turned into a server by installing the appropriate software.

# 2. IP Addresses

**Definition:** An **IP address** is the **identity** of each host on a network. Every single host must have an IP address to communicate over the internet.

**Analogy:**

* Just like a phone number is needed to make or receive phone calls.
* Just like a mailing address is needed to send or receive mail.
* An IP address is needed to send or receive data **packets** on a network.

**How IP Addresses are Used in Communication:** When a host sends data, the IP addresses of both the source and destination are ""stamped"" onto the data packet.

* **Client Request:** When a client sends a web request to a server:
   * The packet will have the **client's IP address** as the **source IP address**.
   * The packet will have the **server's IP address** as the **destination IP address**.
* **Server Response:** When the server responds with the requested webpage:
   * The response packet will have the **server's IP address** as the **source IP address**.
   * The response packet will have the **client's IP address** as the **destination IP address**. This source and destination IP address information is fundamental to all internet communication.

**Structure of an IP Address:**

* An IP address is composed of **32 bits**.
   * A **bit** is a binary digit (a 0 or a 1).
   * Therefore, each IP address is a unique combination of 32 zeros and ones.
* These 32 bits are broken down into **four chunks**, called **octets** (since each chunk contains 8 bits).
* Each octet is then converted into a **decimal number**.
* The smallest decimal number an 8-bit octet can represent is **0**.
* The largest decimal number an 8-bit octet can represent is **255**.
* This is why IP addresses are commonly seen as four numbers (each from 0 to 255) separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
* *(Note: The video mentions that more detailed explanations of binary conversion for IP addresses are available in other linked videos.)*

**Hierarchical Assignment of IP Addresses:** IP addresses are typically assigned in a hierarchical manner, which helps in organizing and routing traffic.

* **Example: Acme Corporation**
   * **Top Level:** Acme Corporation might own all IP addresses starting with `10.x.x.x`.
   * **Office Locations (Subsets):**
      * New York Office: `10.20.x.x`
      * London Office: `10.30.x.x`
      * Tokyo Office: `10.40.x.x`
   * **Teams within Offices (Further Subsets):**
      * New York - Sales Team: `10.20.55.x`
      * New York - Engineering Team: `10.20.66.x`
      * New York - Marketing Team: `10.20.77.x`
* **Pinpointing Location:** This hierarchy allows an IP address to pinpoint the exact location and group of a host. For example, the IP address `10.30.50.x` would identify a host within the Acme Corporation, specifically in the London office, on the sales team.

**Subnetting:**

* The process of breaking up IP addresses into different hierarchies is known as **subnetting**.
* *(Note: The video indicates that subnetting is a more advanced topic and directs viewers to other resources for detailed explanations.)*

# 3. Networks

**Definition:** A **network** is what actually facilitates the **transportation of traffic** between hosts. In its simplest form, connecting any two hosts creates a network.

**Historical Context:** Before networks, data transfer between computers was a manual process (e.g., using physical disks to copy files). Networks automated and streamlined this process, allowing computers to share data automatically.

**Logical Grouping of Hosts:** More broadly, a network is a **logical grouping of hosts that require similar connectivity profiles.**

* **Example: Home Wi-Fi Network**
   * Your computer, printer, laptops, and phones at home all connect to the internet or check email.
   * These devices have similar connectivity needs and are grouped into your home Wi-Fi network.
* **Example: Coffee Shop Wi-Fi Network**
   * Customers at a coffee shop use various mobile devices to access the internet.
   * These devices also have similar connectivity needs but are in a different physical location, so they are grouped into a separate network.

**Networks Containing Other Networks (Subnets):** Networks can contain smaller, nested networks. These are often called **subnetworks** or **subnets**.

* **Example: School Network**
   * A school has its main network.
   * Within the school, each classroom might have its own network for the devices within that classroom. These classroom networks are subnets of the main school network.
* **Revisiting Acme Corporation Example:**
   * The office locations (New York, London, Tokyo) are **subnets** of the overall Acme Corporation IP space.
   * The specific teams (Sales, Engineering, Marketing) within an office are **subnets** of that office's IP space (e.g., the New York IP space).
   * This demonstrates that you can have ""networks within networks within networks.""

**Interconnected Networks and the Internet:** All these individual networks connect to each other. Instead of having every network connect directly to every other network in a complex mesh, they connect to a central resource: **the Internet**.

* The **Internet** itself is simply a vast collection of **interconnected networks**. It comprises company networks, school networks, customer networks, and more, all linked together.
* **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** typically manage and handle these connections, providing the infrastructure that allows networks to communicate globally.

# Key Takeaways from this Lesson:

* **Hosts:** Any device that sends or receives network traffic.
* **Client and Server:** Roles adopted by hosts in a communication (initiating vs. responding), which are relative to the specific interaction.
* **IP Addresses:** The unique identity of each host, essential for communication, and organized hierarchically.
* **Networks:** Logical groupings of hosts with similar connectivity requirements, capable of containing smaller sub-networks, and interconnected to form the Internet.

# Networking Fundamentals: Understanding Network Devices (Part 2)

# The Evolution of Network Connectivity

The initial understanding of a **network** is simply two computers connected by a wire. However, raw data signals degrade over distance.

* **Signal Decay:** When data travels along a wire, its signal strength diminishes.
   * For short distances (e.g., within the same room), this decay is usually negligible, and connectivity is maintained.
   * For longer distances (e.g., opposite sides of a building, or different buildings), the signal can decay completely before reaching its destination, preventing communication.

# 1. Repeaters

* **Purpose:** A **repeater** is a device designed solely to **regenerate signals**.
* **Functionality:** It takes an incoming signal, regenerates it to its original strength, and transmits it out the other side.
* **Benefit:** Repeaters enable connections over greater distances by boosting weakened signals.

# 2. Hubs

The direct, point-to-point connection of hosts doesn't scale efficiently when more devices are added to a network. To address this, centralized devices were introduced.

* **Definition:** A **hub** is essentially a **multi-port repeater**.
* **Functionality:** When a packet arrives on one port of a hub, the hub regenerates the signal and **duplicates** the packet, sending a copy out **all** of its other ports.
* **Benefit:** Solves the scalability issue of direct connections, allowing multiple devices to connect to a central point and communicate.
* **Problem:** Everyone on the network receives everyone else's data, regardless of whether it's intended for them. This creates unnecessary traffic and potential security concerns.

# 3. Bridges

Bridges were developed to address the inefficiency of hubs by intelligently managing traffic.

* **Definition:** A **bridge** is a network device that typically has **two ports** and is designed to sit between hub-connected hosts.
* **Functionality:**
   * Bridges **learn** which hosts are connected to which side of their two ports.
   * They use this knowledge to **contain communication** to only the necessary side.
   * If hosts on one side of the bridge communicate, and the destination is also on that same side, the bridge will *not* forward the traffic to the other side.
   * If the destination host is on the opposite side, the bridge *will* allow the packet to traverse to that side.
* **Benefit:** Bridges are the first devices to help **contain packets** only to their relevant network segments, reducing unnecessary traffic.

# 4. Switches

Switches combine the multi-port capability of hubs with the intelligence of bridges, operating on a per-port basis.

* **Definition:** A **switch** is a device that **facilitates communication within a network**. It's like a combination of a hub and a bridge.
* **Functionality:**
   * **Multi-port:** Like a hub, many devices can connect to a switch.
   * **Intelligent Learning (like bridges, but per-port):** Switches learn which hosts are connected to **each individual port**.
   * When two hosts communicate, the switch knows exactly which ports are involved and only forwards the traffic between those specific ports. It **keeps communication contained** to only the necessary ports.
* **Role in a Network:** Switches connect all the hosts within the **same network**.
   * Recall that a **network** is a **logical grouping of hosts** with similar connectivity requirements and typically shares the same **IP address space**.
   * For example, all devices on your home Wi-Fi network (printer, laptop, phone) are likely connected via a switch (often integrated into your Wi-Fi router) and share an IP address space like `192.168.1.x`.
   * Similarly, all PCs in a single classroom within a school network, or all hosts on a specific team within an office, would be connected by a switch and belong to the same network.

# 5. Routers

While switches facilitate communication *within* a network, **routers** are necessary for communication *between* different networks.

* **Definition:** A **router** is a device whose primary purpose is to **facilitate communication between networks**.
* **Functionality and Role:**
   * **Traffic Control Points:** Routers act as traffic control points between networks. Because all inter-network traffic must flow through a router, they are ideal places to implement **security policies, traffic filtering, or redirection**.
   * **Network Boundaries:** Routers sit on the **boundary** between different networks, providing a logical location for applying security measures. Traditionally, security filtering isn't a primary function of switches for internal network traffic.
   * **Learning Networks (Routes):** Routers **learn which networks they are attached to**. This knowledge is called a **route**.
   * **Routing Table:** Routers store all the networks they know about in a **routing table**. They use this table to determine the appropriate interface to forward traffic.
   * **IP Addresses on Interfaces:** A router has a unique **IP address for each network it's attached to**.
      * For example, if a router connects to Network A and Network B, it will have an IP address that belongs to Network A's IP space on its Network A interface, and an IP address that belongs to Network B's IP space on its Network B interface.
   * **Gateway:** The router's IP address on a specific network serves as the **default gateway** for hosts on that network. A host uses its default gateway to send traffic to devices on *different* networks.
      * If a host wants to communicate with another host *outside* its local network, it sends the data to its default gateway (the router).
* **Creating Network Hierarchy:** Routers are fundamental in creating the **hierarchical structure of networks and IP addresses** (as discussed in Part 1).
   * For instance, in the Acme Corporation example, routers would connect the different team networks within an office, and then connect the office networks to a broader corporate network or directly to the internet.
   * Data flow between different teams or offices always involves traffic traversing one or more routers.
* **The Internet as Interconnected Routers:** The **Internet** itself is essentially a massive collection of **interconnected routers**. When data flows across the internet (e.g., from a host in New York to a host in Tokyo), it's routed from one router to the next until it reaches its destination network.

# Routing vs. Switching: Core Concepts

It's important to distinguish between the *processes* and the *devices*:

* **Routing:** The **process of moving data** ***between*** **networks**.
   * A **router** is a device whose primary purpose is to perform routing.
* **Switching:** The **process of moving data** ***within*** **networks**.
   * A **switch** is a device whose primary purpose is to perform switching.

**Broader Application:** Many other network devices, such as access points, firewalls, load balancers, Layer 3 switches, proxies, and even cloud-based virtual switches and routers, perform either routing, switching, or both. Understanding the core concepts of routing and switching provides a foundation for comprehending how all these diverse devices enable data flow across the internet.

I recently was introduced to this stuff called Yerba Mate by a longtime friend of mine. She is from South America, specifically Brazil, and she drinks this by the liter.

  
I asked her about it one day as I was curious. She explained that basically it's a tea and it's really big in South America, especially in places like Argentina and Uruguay. Naturally I became more curious. So, she showed me the traditional way of doing this.

  
I ended up looking around on amazon to find what I could find. I ended up finding a gourd, bombillas and the yerba mate. I am not familiar with all the different brands and styles. So, my friend recommended me to try taragui sin palo despalada. I ended up purchasing that.

  
I looked at some of the reviews on amazon and on reddit and some were saying that it is bitter. However, I decided to take a chance anyway and ended up loving it. I actually made some this morning and didn't find it bitter at all. It actually had a subtle sweetness to it which I like.

  
As I am new to this still, if you all have any tips, recommendations or just want a friend even, let me know.

(aside from switching therapists),"Honestly I think it's less severe than he is making it out to be. I had paranoia and other psychosis symptoms on and off (occasionally after a couple months it would stop and start again later) Paranoia that got steadily worse up until now where I'm not taking any classes and am not drinking coffee this summer. It's not been perfect but it's been better. (Didn't go to a psychiatrist, didnt get prescribed meds. Where I am therapists are qualified to diagnose.)

My therapist says he thinks I'm developing something along the lines of schizophrenia but apparently that includes cognitive decline and a bunch of negative symptoms, which aside from burnout(that got better, more so now that I'm actually taking a break) and at times having issues with seeming a bit flat emotionally, I don't have.

It's been going in for at least a year but I think I've had similar issues for an unknown amount of time prior and this also coincided with me taking harder classes and bring a full time college student. Admittedly me not caring how I dressed and being spiritual in a certain way was a red flag.

However...I'm not sure where the line is between denial and just straight up ""it's literally not that severe of an issue"". I do admit right now that I have issues and that some of what I thought actually shouldntve ever made sense, and in the past I didn't but I do now...so? Not sure how to bring this up without sounding like I'm in denial however I do think my therapist was trying to be very very proactive.

Admittedly some of the things I thought and experiences were huge red flags given that I'm a woman in my 20s. But still.... sure this could just be denial I guess...",2,1749913509.0,mentalillness,1,1.0,False

I already posted on r/DiagnoseMe and r/AskDocs as well, but sadly to no avail.

For the past year I've had this tingling sensation in every part of my body, the same feeling you get when not enough blood is getting to a body part (like when you lay on your arm, for example). I get it in everywhere, arms, legs, stomach, back, scalp, neck, teeth, tongue, ears, eyes, everywhere. Some days it's worse than others, and there have been periods where it went away almost entirely for a couple of weeks/months. It does sometimes feel like a blood flow issue, because if I raise my arm or even just slightly pinch one of my limbs, it gets worse. For example when I kneel down for a bit my feet go completely numb. It gets A LOT worse when I consume coffeine, like from energy drinks (I don't drink coffee). And it gets worse when I sit or lay down for extended periods of time. I also get twitching and tremors all over my body, even my eyeballs seem to twitch, my vision sometimes ""vibrates"" slightly. When it's really bad my hands cramp together and I can't move them properly. If I exert too much stress on affected muscles, they feel like they're ripping apart, but otherwise the tingling isn't painful.

I'm male, 26, don't take any medications, do take various supplements at the moment (most of them because of this issue), and have been vegan for over 4 years now. I've been to doctors a dozen times in the past 12 months and also to a neurologist, blood tests have been made (two regular tests and one specifically for vitamin B12), but they have all been fine, and recently I had an ECG that was also normal. Nobody knows what the cause may be. Everything was fine for the first 3 years of being vegan, so if I have some sort of deficiency, I don't know what it is. I take magnesium, iron, folic acid, iodine, zinc and B12 supplements at the moment. B12 is the only one I've taken before this started happening, and I tried laying it off to see if it makes a difference, but it didn't.

It's particularly bad today, even though I was doing fine two days ago. And it basically renders me useless, I can't do anything except wait until I'm tired enough to go to sleep again. Even typing/reading this is difficult. So any help would be highly appreciated.",5,1749913405.0,vegan,6,1.0,False

Grab a coffee, ditch the doomscroll, and let‚Äôs talk like neighbors over a firepit.  
I‚Äôm a dad, a husband, a guy who‚Äôs canned tomatoes by lantern light and seen the system‚Äôs sleight-of-hand. This isn‚Äôt a lecture‚Äîit‚Äôs a battle plan to reclaim your health, your kids‚Äô focus, and your grandkids‚Äô freedom. The enemy? A world that‚Äôs turned family into a side hustle. The prize? A life where you‚Äôre the hero, not the hamster.

***The Great Mom Heist: A Century of Strings***

They didn‚Äôt just target your wallet‚Äîthey aimed for the queen. Here‚Äôs how the playbook unfolded:

***Act I***¬†‚ÄîThe Warm-Up, 1900-1945

‚Äîwhen industry tuned the orchestra and women were handed the first shiny ticket to leave the balcony seats at home.

**Factory Fever Hits:**¬†As assembly lines multiplied like rabbits on espresso, a 1914 U.S. Labor bulletin boasted that plugging women into wartime production could¬†**jack up output by 15 percent.**¬†Translation: ‚ÄúPatriotism‚Äù was code for cheaper, nimble labor that didn‚Äôt strike as often‚Äîyet.

**Ad-Man Alchemy:**¬†The cultural chemists got busy.¬†*Ladies‚Äô Home Journal*‚Äîonce the bible of hearth and home‚Äîslashed traditional household ads¬†**41 percent between 1905-1935.**¬†In their place? Dream-weaving copy about office chic and typewriter glory. Subtext: ‚ÄúPolish your shorthand, sister‚Äîyour worth is in the wage, not the rising bread.‚Äù

**Seed of Discontent:**¬†Repetition works miracles. Page by page, the notion sprouted that wiping flour from your apron was settling, while punching a time clock was soaring. Home? Merely a pit stops between productivity sprints.

**Wartime Accelerant:**¬†When World Wars called, governments plastered ‚ÄúWe Need You‚Äù posters faster than troops shipped out. Rosie the Riveter flexed a bicep heard ‚Äôround the world, but the echo said: ‚ÄúStay put after peace; your country‚Äôs GNP loves you.‚Äù

***Act II The Psy-Op, 1945-1975***

‚Äîwhen Madison Avenue teamed up with Langley to remix freedom into a punch-clock anthem.

**Operation Liberation‚ÄîSponsored by Langley:**¬†Thanks to a juicy 2011 FOIA leak, we now know the CIA sluiced¬†**$1.5 million (1967 dollars)**¬†through ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù foundations to bankroll¬†*Ms. Magazine.*¬†The glossy manifesto preached that the height of emancipation was‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîclocking in beside Bob from Accounting. Translation: swap the hearth for fluorescent lighting and call it progress.

**Big Tobacco‚Äôs Feminist Filter:**¬†Sensing gold in those unlit purses, ad execs draped cigarettes in Women‚Äôs Lib slogans. Result? Female lung-cancer deaths¬†**exploded 316 percent between 1965-1990.**¬†Lighting up was branded as torch-bearing freedom; instead, it torched alveoli while Philip Morris banked liberation-flavored profit.

**McKinsey‚Äôs Master Plan:**¬†In 1972, the consulting wizards penned a memo practically drooling: if housewives joined the workforce en masse, corporations could tap a¬†**$60 billion**¬†spending surge‚Äîroughly¬†**$420 billion today.**¬†That wasn‚Äôt a glass ceiling they saw; it was a glass cash register.

Bottom line: the post-war narrative pivoted from ‚ÄúRosie the Riveter saves democracy‚Äù to ‚ÄúRosie, get back on the assembly line so GDP can deadlift.‚Äù The psy-op wasn‚Äôt about choice; it was about channels‚Äîredirecting feminine energy from homegrown resilience to corporate revenue streams.

# Counter-Scripts from Mr. Holistic

1. **Liberate on Your Own Ledger:**¬†Freedom means owning your schedule, not swapping aprons for HR badges. Build micro-businesses‚Äîherbal skincare, backyard produce, homeschooling co-ops‚Äîthat keep wealth cycling inside the family unit.
2. **Smoke Out the Symbolism:**¬†Trade the ‚Äúslim, menthol kiss of independence‚Äù for deep diaphragmatic breaths. Pranayama breaks light up mitochondria without carcinogens‚Äîor quarterly shareholder calls.
3. **Skill-Stack, Don‚Äôt Shack-Up:**¬†Instead of chasing external validation, stack practical crafts‚Äîgardening, woodworking, herbal alchemy. When skills compound, outside manipulation loses leverage.
4. **Media Fast & Fact-Check:**¬†One weekend a month, detox from legacy narratives. Read original studies, interview elders, compare notes. When propaganda meets community-curated truth, it evaporates like cheap perfume.
5. **Finance Feminine Wisdom:**¬†Pool neighborhood resources for communal kitchens, barter babysitting, and local credit circles. Keep the capital loop tight; every dollar that stays local downgrades Big Corp‚Äôs extraction game.

Remember: True liberation never needs a PR campaign‚Äîit shows up quietly in sovereign households, healthy lungs, and kids who know their parents‚Äô faces better than a brand logo. De-psy-op your life; the only agenda you should clock into is your own.

***Act III***¬†‚Äî The Debt Trap, 1975-2000

‚Äîwhere the American Dream got repo‚Äôd while we were still test-driving it.

**Two-Income Tightrope:**¬†By the late ‚Äô70s one paycheck went the way of rotary phones. Households needed¬†**dual earners just to keep the lights on**, not to fund ski trips. The day Mom marched into the workplace wasn‚Äôt pure liberation‚Äîit was survival dressed up as progress.

**Homes on Hyper-Markup:**¬†From 1970-2000, the average house price ballooned¬†**118 percent above inflation.**¬†Same bricks, same shingles‚Äîjust a mortgage big enough to moonlight as a second spouse. Families shackled themselves to 30-year notes longer than most sitcoms stay on the air.

**Higher-Ed Hustle:**¬†College stopped being a ladder and morphed into a catapult that fires tuition bills. Since 1978, the sticker price rocketed¬†**1,380 percent**¬†while the Consumer Price Index merely jogged¬†**409 percent.**¬†Translation: a bachelor‚Äôs degree now costs more than a small kingdom‚Äîand you still graduate eating instant noodles.

**Divorce Detonation:**¬†Stress, debt, and overwork took their pound of flesh. Between 1940 and 1980, divorce rates¬†**quadrupled.**¬†The financial fallout? Women‚Äôs wealth plunged¬†**77 percent**, men‚Äôs¬†**42 percent**¬†after the gavel. Love wasn‚Äôt the only thing split; assets scattered like confetti at a courthouse.

***Act IV***¬†‚Äî Welcome to¬†**The Modern Cage, 2000-Now**‚Äîshiny, touchscreen bars included.

**Screen-time Shackles:**¬†The average human thumbs their phone¬†**144 times a day**‚Äîbasically a nervous tic we call ‚Äúchecking notifications.‚Äù Each pickup drips dopamine, then yanks it away, leaving us twitchier than a squirrel on espresso. Family dinner? More like four glowing rectangles silently devouring attention spans.

**Chemical Clampdown:**¬†While we scroll,¬†**BPA and cousins**¬†crash the party. Between 1973 and 2011, male sperm counts nosedived¬†**59 percent.**¬†Ladies didn‚Äôt escape; endocrine havoc triggers everything from cystic ovaries to mood swings worthy of a telenovela finale. Plastics may be convenient, but so is a Trojan horse.

**Mommy-Juice Mirage:**¬†Marketing wizards rebranded wine as ‚ÄúMommy Juice,‚Äù serving stress relief in stemware. Result?¬†**Female alcohol-related deaths skyrocketed 85 percent (1999-2017).**¬†That isn‚Äôt empowerment‚Äîthat‚Äôs self-medication writ large, with Big Booze cashing the checks.

And here‚Äôs the gut-punch:¬†**Mom wasn‚Äôt liberated; she was subcontracted.**¬†Corporations snagged her productivity at wholesale rates while outsourcing childcare to screens and fast-food drive-thrus. Profits ballooned; family cohesion burst at the seams. Dad‚Äôs hustling, Mom‚Äôs hustling, kids are hustling‚Äînobody‚Äôs actually living.

# Break the Bars‚ÄîMr. Holistic-Style

1. **Digital Sabbath:**¬†Park phones in ‚Äúairplane jail‚Äù two hours daily. Watch conversation resurrect like Lazarus with Wi-Fi off.
2. **Glass & Stainless Swap-out:**¬†Chuck plastic food containers; invite glass and metal to the cupboard party. BPA can‚Äôt hack what it can‚Äôt touch.
3. **Mindful Pour:**¬†Swap that nightly vino for adaptogenic elixirs‚Äîthink reishi, ashwagandha, sparkling water if you‚Äôre fancy. Your liver will send thank-you notes in the morning.
4. **Family Sweat Ritual:**¬†Three times a week, move as a unit‚Äîhike, dance-off, backyard calisthenics. Exercise spikes oxytocin and testosterone while booting cortisol to the curb.
5. **Whole-Food Firewall:**¬†Shop the perimeter of the grocery store, the land where ingredients still resemble nouns, not laboratory Scrabble.

Remember, cages feel comfy when the bars are made of convenience‚Äîbut comfort is the cousin of captivity. Rattle those bars until they bend. Reclaim presence over pings, purity over plastics, community over corporate quotas. The Modern Cage only holds those who don‚Äôt realize the lock is on the inside.

***The kicker? Mom wasn‚Äôt freed‚Äîshe was outsourced. Corporate profits ballooned while families paid the price.***

3 | The Biology They Hide.

The system‚Äôs not just after your time‚Äîit‚Äôs rewiring your body.

* Stress vs. Love: A 2021 Zurich study found stressed moms have 40% less oxytocin, linked to harsher parenting.
* Toxic Load: NHANES 2019 detected phthalates in 97% of Americans; high levels double anxiety risk.
* Men Fade: NIH data shows testosterone drops 1% yearly, worsened by alcohol (23% lower free T from one IPA/day).

Result? Anxious moms, tired dads, and kids with ADHD at 9.8% prevalence. Pharma‚Äôs antidepressant sales hit $18B in 2024. Coincidence? Nah.

Think the modern circus only juggles your calendar? Nah, friend‚Äîit‚Äôs flicking switches on your biology like a greedy kid in a light-show booth.

First, cue the¬†**Stress-Vs-Love Smackdown.**¬†Zurich researchers (2021) peeked at new moms and found a brutal stat: chronic stress slices their oxytocin‚Äîthe cuddle chemical‚Äîby about¬†**40 percent.**¬†Less oxytocin = more ‚Äúput your shoes on NOW!‚Äù energy. Translation: Mommy Dearest isn‚Äôt a monster; she‚Äôs running on biochemical fumes.

Next ring: the¬†**Toxic-Load Tilt-A-Whirl.**¬†NHANES (2019) swabbed Americans and discovered¬†**phthalates in 97 percent**¬†of us. These plasticizers hijack hormones so well they should charge rent. High levels? They¬†**double your anxiety risk.**¬†Ever feel inexplicably edgy in the cereal aisle? That‚Äôs not just decision fatigue‚Äîthat‚Äôs endocrine sabotage hidden in the packaging.

Slide over to the men‚Äôs locker room. NIH data confirms the¬†**Testosterone Slow Fade**‚Äîabout¬†**1 percent per year.**¬†Toss back a single daily IPA and free T nosedives another¬†**23 percent.**¬†Bro, that ‚Äúdad bod‚Äù might be less about skipped push-ups and more about chemical castration in a pint glass.

Add it up: anxious moms, fatigued dads, and‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äî**kids ping-ponging with ADHD (9.8 percent prevalence).**¬†Big Pharma‚Äôs smelling opportunity like a raccoon near a tipped trash can:¬†**$18 billion in antidepressants sold in 2024.**¬†Coincidence? The house always wins when it rigs the game.

But here‚Äôs the plot twist they don‚Äôt advertise on late-night TV: your biology is¬†**hackable‚Äîin the good way.**¬†Swap plastic-wrapped snacks for food that still remembers soil. Trade doom-scrolling for a sunset walk (bonus: natural light recalibrates cortisol and melatonin like a free spa treatment). Brew nervine herbs‚Äîthink chamomile, skullcap, or Mr. Holistic‚Äôs forthcoming knockout tea blend‚Äîand watch your parasympathetic system stretch out like a cat in sunbeams. Dads: ditch that ‚Äújust one‚Äù IPA for 30 days, stack zinc, magnesium, and resistance training, then high-five your resurrected testosterone. Moms: pair mindful breathwork with a magnesium-rich Epsom soak; oxytocin loves calm.

Remember, the system can only rewire what you leave unguarded. So guard it. Reclaim it. Upgrade it. Because when the family unit hums biologically, the profiteers can keep their pills‚Äîand we can keep our sanity.

4 | Our Family‚Äôs Fight Back

We didn‚Äôt just spot the trap‚Äîwe broke out. Here‚Äôs how:

1. She‚Äôs the CEO: My wife ditched her corporate gig. OECD data: kids with a stay-at-home parent read 15 points better. Her job netted $112/month after daycare and taxes. Freedom > chump change.
2. I Stepped Up: I hit the gym‚Äîdeadlift from 185 to 315 pounds, heart rate down 12 bpm. Our fights? Down 60% (our notebook doesn‚Äôt lie).
3. We Grew Food: Our 1/8-acre garden yielded 310 pounds of produce‚Äî$900 at organic prices. The kids snack with pride.
4. And now we are here to help you.

This isn‚Äôt Luddite cosplay‚Äîit‚Äôs strategy. We‚Äôre happier, healthier, and our kids aren‚Äôt screen zombies.

# You‚Äôre the Quiet Architect of Civilization

From your kitchen command center you balance budgets, nutrition labels, and little egos in a single bound. You‚Äôre not ‚Äújust a mom‚Äù; you‚Äôre the Chief Development Officer of tomorrow‚Äôs citizens. The slice-and-dice lesson you give on bell peppers? That‚Äôs a STEM lab in vitamin form. The manners you model at the dinner table? That‚Äôs diplomacy training the UN wishes it could replicate.

Ancient Rome‚Äôs emperors armed whole legions, yet they trembled at the influence of mothers whispering virtues into young Caesar‚Äôs ear. Empires crumble when moms abandon their posts; they flourish when you stand firm in fuzzy slippers, wielding a wooden spoon like a scepter.

# Love: The Most Explosive Renewable Energy

Your lullabies calibrate nervous systems. Your hugs reset cortisol levels better than any spa package. When you kneel to eye-level during a meltdown and speak soft wisdom, you‚Äôre engraving neural pathways of resilience. If scientists could bottle the electromagnetic pulse of maternal affection, Wall Street would bid on it like Bitcoin circa 2017.

Need proof? Study after study shows kids who feel securely attached to a nurturing parent score higher in problem-solving, empathy, and basic happiness indices. Translation: that bedtime giggle-fest is literally rewiring their brains for greatness. You‚Äôre not wasting time‚Äîyou‚Äôre time-traveling, shaping futures before they arrive.

# The Power Multiplier Effect

Let‚Äôs play a game of one-degree-of-mom. Teach a child patience and you reduce tomorrow‚Äôs road-rage incident. Inspire curiosity and you birth the next vaccine researcher‚Äîor the novelist who heals nations with words. Every sandwich with the crusts cut off is a micro-investment in human potential. Forget trickle-down economics‚Äîthis is¬†**ripple-out magnificence**.

* **Speak power into the mirror.**¬†Mornings are won or lost at the sink. Replace ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exhausted‚Äù with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm essential.‚Äù Your reflection is listening.
* **Model healthy rebellion.**¬†Say no to over-commitment, toxic comparison, and the myth of perfect motherhood. Your kids need a mother, not a martyr.
* **Network with your tribe.**¬†Iron sharpens iron‚Äîand laughter sharpens sanity. Schedule that mom-crew coffee; civilization depends on it.
* **Teach legacy, not laundry.**¬†Yes, the hamper is overflowing, but so is your chance to instill integrity, curiosity, and courage. Choose the eternal impact over the immediate glare of grass-stained jeans.This isn‚Äôt a pep talk for the fridge door. It‚Äôs a torch-passing ceremony. History applauds warriors, inventors, and presidents, yet behind nearly every headline hero stands a woman who once tied their shoes and reminded them to say please. That‚Äôs you. Own it, wield it, write it on the inside of your eyelids if you must.Rome‚Äôs emperors got one thing right: armies conquer land,¬†**mothers conquer time**. Your influence stretches beyond your lifespan, echoing in classrooms, boardrooms, and parliaments not yet built. The world will keep spinning whether or not we recognize that truth‚Äîbut when you recognize it, the spin becomes a [dance.So](http://dance.So), queen of the cul-de-sac, adjust your invisible crown, tighten that messy bun, and stride back into the fray. Your unpaid labor is the engine of society, your love its octane. Light up your corner so fiercely that satellites mistake it for sunrise.Stoke It Until It Roars 

7 | To the Kings

Dads, I will be diving into us next, sorry we come in second for a reason. But i will leave you with this, CDC says reading to your toddler 3x/week builds a 2,000-word vocab edge by kindergarten. That‚Äôs legacy. Lift weights, lead prayers, lock your phone in a drawer. Your kids don‚Äôt need a TikTok dad‚Äîthey need you present. Time is your crown. Wear it. Show up with a shovel in hand, not an iPad. Rolling tiny wheelbarrows next to Dad isn‚Äôt just adorable Instagram bait‚Äîit‚Äôs a developmental goldmine for the pint-sized human:

# 

8 | Your One-Day Revolution

Tomorrow, snap one chain:

* Plant Something: NASA says greens boost morale 18%. Try lettuce in a pot.
* Ditch Delivery: Statista: families spend $4,000/year on takeout. Cook once, save twice.
* Audit the Car: AAA: second car costs $12,182/year. Sell it, bank it.
* Read Aloud: Pediatrics: 15 minutes boosts empathy 30%. Grab a book, make magic.

One move cracks the cage.

Finale: This. Is. Sovereignty.

Mother-warrior, plant your feet in the soil, shoulders squared, eyes blazing. Feel the ground quake? That‚Äôs every grandmother before you pounding war drums in Valhalla, yelling ‚ÄúHold the line!‚Äù

Tonight, snuff the blue glow. Ignite a single beeswax torch and watch shadows dance like ancestors around the hearth. Hear that hiss? Convenience is frying in its own grease.

At dawn, choose your weapon:

Cast‚Äëiron skillet?

Self-education?

Garden trowel?

Homeschool lesson book?

Grab your infant and do some baby yoga? (It‚Äôs a thing, moms! Studies say it‚Äôs a calming and enjoyable way to bond while providing physical, emotional and social benefits for your baby.)

Lift it overhead and roar so the algorithm trembles:

‚ÄúTHIS. IS. MY. HOUSE!‚Äù

Every seed planted is a spear in the ground. Every homemade meal is a shield raised. Every bedtime story is arrow‚Äëfire into tomorrow.

Call your sister‚Äëqueens. Bang pots like Spartan shields until cul‚Äëde‚Äësacs echo. Swap jam for ammo, barter eggs for intel, babysit as battlefield triage. Tribe beats algorithm every single sunrise.

Post your first victory in the comments‚Äîone chain shattered, one coil cut. Let‚Äôs flood the digital gate with proof that the Queenpins march again, aprons flying like crimson capes.

No retreat, no DoorDash, no surrender.

I've already cut off a few so-called friends who've tried pulling this both sides crap. But there's several parts of this situation that make me feel it's a little different.

That said it's still quite distressing and I could use some advice.

Before I stopped talking to my narc mom, we had a family friend. We'll call him Farid. Farid is Palestinian and fell in love with the American countryside while visiting for a foreign exchange program. While here, he befriended my sister who loves hiking. From there, he met my lovely father who was very welcoming and my mom who cooked for him and let him stay over. He began to feel that my family was his surrogate American family.

He refers to me as his sibling, though I still don't think I've spent enough time with him to truly KNOW him yet. He's been around for five years but we rarely got alone time together.

My dad died in January and my mom revealed her true colors. I finally cut her off after years of abuse. Farid meanwhile still sometimes asks to get coffee and catch up with me.

Often plans fall through. He's a busy guy. But sometimes they don't and we get a chance to really talk. He's been very concerned about his surrogate family falling apart. He is empathetic but doesn't seem to truly understand my reasons for going nc. There's some cultural and language barriers in the way but also he's not super emotionally intelligent so I just don't think this is something he CAN understand.

The last two times we've met, he has tried to tell me that my mom asks him about me all the time. She's telling him she's really worried about me. Farid has recommended I reach out and give her another chance twice now. The second time, I did a good thing and put my foot down.

I told him ""Farid, I know you're trying to be helpful, but this isn't a problem you can fix. Please promise me you'll drop this. I'll talk to you about my mom once I'm ready.""

He seemed to get it. He promised not to keep bringing it up. He also assured me he hasn't and will never talk to my mom about the things I talk about with him. That's nice. But also I can't really know if it's true or not. I want to believe him but I've been let down before.

Farid wants to keep me in his life no matter what. He's even proposed working on a project together. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt. He's always been kind to me. But I'm very worried about him getting manipulated into being my mom's unwitting pawn.

He's clearly very lonely too. He wants connection because he's so far from his own family.

I am thinking about buying a house with spacious lot in rural serbia and live by myself, the location doesn‚Äôt really matter as I don‚Äôt travel often, work online and would ideally drive if I have to go somewhere. Also I prefer to be far away from the city. The only requirement regarding the location is that I would prefer it to be somewhere without the serious arsenic pollution in water. 

I have been browsing the website and some agencies and despite most of the houses being a bit shabby and under-furnished, some of them are quite nicely maintained and cost about 30k euros to 50k euros. Fully legalisied as well.  Is this price legit? Can I expect to find ones like these in areas without water poisoning. and do you have any good recommendations for finding a house like that (online)? I know talking to villagers would be the best option but at this point my Serbian is still unforgivably deplorable. 

A follow up question is what is the average living cost for one person living in rural Serbia, given that he or she doesn‚Äôt buy things a lot and doesn‚Äôt drink alcohol or coffee or smoke.

‚ÄúSteroids build muscle but they don‚Äôt burn fat. Lose weight first. Then hop on.‚Äù

No.

What they mean is: stay broken. Stay tired. Stay soft. Get your punishment first.

Six weeks ago I started TRT. 120mg a week. Split every 3.5 days. IM. Protocol clean. Sleep clean. Diet clean.

Before that I was a ghost. Fogged out. Floating through meetings. Screens. Half-finished lifts. Coffee at 9pm just to feel something.

Now I wake up charged. Wired. I don‚Äôt stop moving. 12,000 steps before sunset. Lifting to failure. Feeling skin stretch, contract. Body shape shifting under the mirror lights. Shoulders. Veins. Traps. Waist shrinking. Chest pushing outward. Eyes clear.

TRT didn‚Äôt fix my life. It turned the volume up on everything I wanted it to be.

People say it‚Äôs placebo. People say it‚Äôs the honeymoon phase. Maybe.

I say it‚Äôs real. I say I‚Äôm not dragging myself anymore. I say I‚Äôm not hiding behind fat-loss calculators waiting to be worthy of transformation.

Today I started out brewing my regular V60 recipe (James Hoffman's V60 01 recipe), so:

- 15 g coffee (ground 60 on my DF54, El Salvador, light roast)

- 50 g bloom

- 00:45: 50 g water (total 100 g)

- 1:00: 10s rest

- 1:10: 50 g water (total 150 g)

- 1:20: 10s rest

Here's where I fumbled, the rest of the recipe should go:

- 1:30: 50 g water (total 200 g)

- 1:40: 10s rest

- 1:50: 50 g water (total 250 g)

- draw down, total brew time 2:30-3:00

Except, I had forgotten to fill my kettle with fresh water so I ran out of water at around 177 g. I ran to refill it and boil more water, but by the time it was done, the timer read 3:00 and the coffee bed was completely dry. I added the remaining water in 2 stages up to 250 g as normal, but essentially there was an unintended 1:15 break between pours.

I expected the coffee to taste foul, but it was surprisingly balanced. Some of the notes that I don't typically get with the normal V60 and can only get with the Switch were there. A lot of menthol freshness and some juicy acidity that had been missing from my regular brews. I think the pause lowered the temperature of the coffee already in the server and it ended up being a bootleg Tetsu Kasuya 4:6 method. I'll try recreating it tomorrow with a little more precision, so something like:

- 15 g coffee (ground 60 on my DF54, El Salvador, light roast)

- 50 g bloom

- 00:45: 50 g water (total 100 g)

- 1:00: 10s rest

- 1:10: 50 g water (total 150 g)

- 1:20: 1 min rest

- 2:20: 100 g water (total 250 g)

And the drug part really got me... they also take medications for disorders but their disorders aren't invisible...? They take medications for more ""physical"" illnesses such as diabetes or heart stuff. Mine is different though because.... it's not as visible or as direct?

Why do people with physical disorders usually never get asked ""Oh wow so you use a wheel chair did you self diagnose?"" And if they do it's less frowned upon. It's because it's physical, direct to see to them. It's easier to understand than put yourself in someone elses shoes. I wouldn't call it a lack of empathy but... is it the wrong kind of empathy? As an autistic person this has always made me wonder how many types of empathy are there? Blind empathy or more deeper thinking empathy? Just a thing I wonder a lot....

Drinking coffee is not seen as bad it enchances you makes you more focused so in a way it is a form of a drug. People don't get judged for drinking a bunch of coffee to get through a day at work. This is far more nuanched than this though, I am not claiming that people who drink coffee are the same as people who take drugs or something....

Do we neurodivergent or ""different"" people just question or see things the neurotypicals usually don't talk about? Why is it not okay to talk about certain truths.... it's not okay to be truthful in some contexts? Also again to make it super clear this is not a neurotypical vs neurodivergent thing, I think a lot of neurotypicals see these but don't question them as openly as we do.

Luckily people these days understand neurodivegence more and a lot of neurotypical are open to being more understanding and listening. Still there is this certain thing about the invisible disabilities... you're not autistic you're ""stupid, slow"" you don't have adhd you are ""just lazy, focus more, running around"" you don't have dyslexia you're ""too lazy to read"".... as if we aren't willing? We are willing but our capabilities are different...

I've been a life long smoker/vaper and finally quit both to ultimately go to zyn. It was great at first, I stated with 3m coffee flavored and it was a nice addition to Splitgate 2. But I soon got bored of 3m and went to 6m. I noticed that after two or three pouches I would immediately get bad hiccups and nausea. I started have diarrhea all the time and green stool. I immediately knew it was the zyn and stopped. 

At this point I'm only about six cans in. For whatever reason I put one last one in and I regret it more than post but clarity. Legit within 5 min I had horrible hiccups and pain in my stomach that felt like I was stabbed. I spit the zyn out and started doing everything I could to stop the inflammation. Ginger/tumeric tea, sour kraut, kimchi, and Keefer. I've noticed an immediate turn around in symptoms but feel I may have sibo. So I am going to my Dr to get checked. I had an endoscopy scope last year and had zero issues.i pray I do not need another one but it's best to make sure. 

From what I've learned the nicotine irritates the stomach lining and the artificial sweeteners can cause a build up of a batrica in the same intestine. Also due to the large amount of formaldehyde, and heavy metals it has the possibility to cause leaky guy which is horrifying in itself. If you have any issues from zyn do not drink, soda, coffee, or eat spicy, fried, or highly processed Foods. Put lots of anti inflammatory food to help get your stomach back to a place where it can heal. 

I hopes this helps anyone with there, stay strong and know your not alone. 

I'm leaving a link to an article that helped me out a lot.

We both have the same taste in music and even matched orders when it comes to coffee. She always say that we are ""twin flames"", and honestly? I felt that it was true at first. I don't have a lot of friends and thought I got lucky with a nice work buddy.

Until she started ""borrowing"" things. It started with just small stuff- pens, some tissue, a bit of hand lotion. Then she asked if she could use my perfume ""just today"", and I said sure. But the next day, she said she really like how my perfume smell and asked to use it again. Then again. Eventually, she doesn't even ask anymore, just casually using my perfume like it's part of her routine.

One time, she asked if I could lend her money for lunch and she'll pay me tomorrow. I did. Then it became ""Can I pay you back next week?"" and ""I left my wallet again."" Guess what? She never paid me back.

The last straw for me was when she asked me to log her into the system whenever she came in late so that it wouldn't reflect on her attendance. I value being on time, and I am not going to cover for someone who clearly doesn't. If being a ""work bestie"" means risking name and integrity? I'm out.

I finally pulled away and stopped sharing my things with her. She started buddying up to someone else, and yep, I saw her spraying their perfume yesterday.

# AEO Services: Nailing Those Instant Answers

Ever ask Google, ‚ÄúHow do I fix a squeaky door?‚Äù and get a neat little answer box at the top? Or maybe you‚Äôve yelled at your Alexa, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a good marinade for chicken?‚Äù and gotten a quick recipe. That‚Äôs an answer engine in action‚Äîsearch tools that skip the link-hunting and go straight to the solution.

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) services are all about making *your* content that instant answer. These services tweak your website to tackle common questions head-on, so you show up in Google‚Äôs snippets or voice search results.

AEO services turn your content into the answer everyone‚Äôs looking for, boosting traffic and trust.

# GEO Services: Riding the AI Wave

Now, let‚Äôs talk about generative engines‚ÄîAI tools that *create* content from scratch. Picture asking a chatbot, ‚ÄúGive me a workout plan for beginners,‚Äù and it spits out a full routine.

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) services make your content a go-to source for these AI tools. By creating rich, detailed material, we ensure AI picks *your* stuff when crafting responses, putting your brand in front of users who didn‚Äôt even know you existed.

# AEO vs. GEO vs. SEO: The Lowdown

Confused about how AEO and GEO stack up against old-school Search Engine Optimization (SEO)? Here‚Äôs the tea:

* **SEO**: This is about climbing search rankings with keywords, backlinks, and site tweaks to land on page one.
* **AEO**: This zeros in on being the direct answer for questions, perfect for voice searches and snippets.

First of all, this is my first comment on reddit(or almost anywhere) and i would like to thank all you redditors and all people in my long journey of healing from that vicious bug. ¬†I'll try to be as short as i can. My assumption is that i had H.pylori for 10 or more years (college days), because i had extreme anxiety when people watched me something i do, which is not something i had before ( it all started at age of 19 and now i am in my early mid 30's). Anxiety included : hand tremor, sweating profusely and face redness. I also had disruptive sleep, night sweats and sometimes rashes. I was partying heavily and was extremly drunk at least 2 days a week. Then after let's say 2 years i developed gastritis with gastric ulcer ( also assumption). I had terrible pains( especially when i drank shots of whiskey and had such epigastric pain that i usually almost always must' ve lie down). From that time ( let s say 8-10 years ago) onwards every day i had epigastric pain in morning with nausea. I was young and didn' t quite think that was abnormal, because i lived live filled with alcohol and later smoked like chimney. That's my assumption, of course. First ‚Äûdifferent‚Äú symptoms that i ve' let's say ""visualized"" started 5 years ago. My toes where like frozen and numb at same time. I thought it was all connected with alcohol and cigarettes. I had terrible sleep disturbances ( waking up every 2-3 hours ) also never could 've go to sleep before 2 am. I had horendeous nightmares. ¬†Pain was getting worse from day to day i was spitting brownish -reddish mucus every morning , had heart palpitations, sweating abnormally, had chapped lips, fragile skin on fingers and so on. At one moment i was extremly depressive, almost suicidal, but fortunately have a great and supportive family . In that whole terrible period i did 2 courses of antibiotics. And after COVID ( i presume) all my symptoms returned. So in 5 - 10 years i was never exactly symptom free. So what to do? With help of my really genious family care practitioner, he proposed that i do a natural route ( first time, but i didn't ¬†listen , i wanted antibiotics ‚Äì idiot!?) . I made my investigation and decided that i would try it. So part that you all want to know, isn't it ?!  After years and years of suffering¬† first you MUST DO is change your habits. If you smoke, STOP smoking. If you do drugs, STOP doing drugs. If you drink alcohol STOP drinking alcohol. And if you drink coffee, i am sorry but STOP drinking COFFEE. That is first step! Sometimes just that is enough, but rarely. Secondly i had to stop DIARY and GLUTEN for at least 3 months. ¬†ALSO NO SWEETS. Why? Because every time i drank milk, in 30 minutes or even less i had diarrhea. Every time i ate pasta or anything including even the slightest of gluten i was sweating terribly and had like ‚Äûmobile phone vibrating sensation‚Äú in my stomach with shakiness of hands. Then third and last. Some angel ( everyone who helped me on Reddit is angel!) wrote on reddit: ‚Äû Eat 1cup (or something like that) of broccoli sporouts on empty stomach for at least 1 week.‚Äú My protocol was like this : I ate at least 30-70g broccoli sprouts on empty stomach for 3 weeks following¬† 1 week of not eating and then repeating it 3-4 times. So 2-3 months of eating non stop broccoli sprouts. After 1 hour you will feel nauseous, and i fell that this ‚Äûnauseous‚Äú‚Äú effect kills H.pylori , and when there is none of that felling you' ve more than likely killed it. Not my words,but words of that ‚Äûangel‚Äú person and it worked for me. I also ate 1-2 cloves of garlic ( usually cooked on stove with olive oil (also in extreme amounts) with broccoli or cabbage or something cruciferous. I ate only canned fish or cooked fish ( salmon, tuna for example) with non- gluten corn grits. Also of big importance lots and lots of fermented beets and beet juice ( supermarket is also acceptable). I drank lots of licorice tea¬† and kombucha. NO FIZZY DRINKS! Meat: usually chicken ,sometimes pork. I tried black seed oil, but that worsened my gastritis.¬† I would like to mention that i tried MASTIC gum for 6 weeks and hyperdoses like 4 capsules every 8 hours for 6 weeks.¬† I also ate lots of dried fruits like cranberries ( with apple juice not with industrial sugar) ,dates, apricots, cherries and other non dried frutis like bananas, blueberries and peaches. I almost forgot HONEY ( just real honey) 1 - 3 teaspoons a day.I think i covered most of it. So my starting treatment was : MASTIC GUM 4 x capsules every 8 hours for 6- 8 weeks(approximately) with broccoli sprouts in cycles ( 30- 70g in morning on empty stomach , at least 30 minutes before eating and drinking anything else) for 2-3 weeks, olive oil in food like salads or with cooked fish like salmon and i gradually added all that i covered from above. I think broccoli sporouts alone on empty stomach, in high doses , can kill H.pylori alone , if you ask me. Also honey is very very important, but on empty stomach it can worsen symptoms, so i recommend using it after you' ve eaten. Also maybe honey will also kill H.pylori, but equally important thing is to BELIEVE that what you eat will destroy it. Not to be mistaken that, when you destroy that hellish bacteria, you won' t feel immidiately better. It takes time. For me...answer that i was Helicobacter pylori free ¬†first came in my dream . When finally, after years of suffering and having horrendously tough dreams in my dreams i began to thought my demons. When i was attacked in my dreams from let's say man with axe i almost always surrendered and consequently died horrible death in my sleep. But first time after years of battling helicobacter pylori i spat at enemy and he died. ¬†I was so happy i cried. I knew it was over. Of course gastritis is still here but, hey i ate pizza 2 days ago without consequences. I have to be careful with tomatoes and some spicy foods, but after years of having trouble eating almost anything i am almost completely symptom free. To add something. When eveything started i was little bit overweight, excessive smoker and drinker. Today i am enormously active in sports, never felt better, never looked better(to myself of course) i eat healthy and live healthy¬† life. As a matter of fact, Helicobacter pylori was like some torturer which was killing you steadily but after you' ve ran away from it, you developed a sense of gratitude for your life now. Some kind of Stockholm syndrome if i may say so. Thank you everyone once again and big thanks to my greatest family care practitioner ever and my beloving family. And don't give up... i didn' t! ADDITION: I tried cabbage juice and cranberry juice, but cranberry juice worsened my gastritis and cabbage juice..well....who can drink and enjoy that flavour ...well all the best to that person. I don't want to use other more appropriate words because i' ll go to jail haha  Helicobacter pylori feeds with B vitamins ,iron and other nutrients so all bizzare symptoms are from that ( lack of that nutrients). I don' t use anything today, just have healthy and balanced diet. My long story isn't just speculation, i also had 1 gastroscopy (which showed 2 gastric ulcers and active gastritis with GERD)  with biopsy and 5-6 stool tests on H.pylori ( some positive some negative in those couple of years). That information is for those of you who are sceptic, probably cabbage juice drinkers (just joking). All the best!",2,1749911027.0,HPylori,3,0.67,False

How does a 27 year old man make friends here? For a bit of background: I've been in Jax since early 2022. I PCS'd here from VA. I had a few friends when I first moved here, but they've all left over the years and all of my friends from VA are either still there or halfway across the country doing their own thing. Due to some medical issues I have, I might be getting out of the military and settling in Jax, so I'd love to make some IRL friends since I don't know very many people here outside of my coworkers. I stay in the Hyde Park/Sweetwater area but I'm moving to Orange Park in a few months!

I'm not married and I have no children, so life is already kind of slow for me as it is and since COVID I've been very much an inside person. Playing video games and interacting with people on discord was my entertainment. Well, I no longer desire to be glued to my computer or a phone screen all day. I want to get out and have more real, solid interactions with people. 

Here are a few things I like to do in my off-time. I like shooting/going to the range, cookouts/BBQs (I'll bring food), I love technology, I love geography, I love music, I love ramen (I could eat ramen everyday), I love animals. Love to take zoo or aquarium trips, I love to try new foods but Asian is my preference, I love to travel and see new things even if it's just locally. Also, volunteering is fun too. I've been using Meetup to try to and meet new people in the community and do different things but it seems like nothing is ever going on during the weekends here...or I could just be looking in the wrong place. Lol.

I'm always down to grab a coffee or a bite to eat. If it involves getting out of the house and doing something that involves socializing with people: I'm down for it depending on my schedule. I do take online courses for college and like most people: I have my own adult errands and business I have to tend to, but some days I do want to just chill inside and relax. I drink socially and since COVID I haven't been much of a night club/party person. I prefer something slower and quieter like a lounge or bar type of environment. Just somewhere I can sit, chill and socialize with others and just learn about other peoples lives, interests and such. Since COVID I've been pretty laid back and chill.

If you've made it to the end of this post: thank you so much for reading! If I sound like someone you can vibe with: hit me up! It's Saturday and I'm free!

This trip will be to determine if I can stay and work remotely for long periods of time throughout the year with my family (I will need good internet). I visited Guanacaste years ago and fell in love with CR, and have always wanted to come back!  We chose San Jose as a home base because it has all the city things we would need for long term stay while I work, but we want to explore as much as possible. We love coffee, beaches, hiking all the things CR has to offer but logistically I am a little stuck on whether to take several day trips to different areas or to stay a week or longer in multiple places.  This is not what I would consider a 'tourist' style trip, more of a scouting trip, but I will need fast internet throughout the day for at least the last two weeks, and I need to convince my husband that CR is amazing! Any advice on how to approach? Is San Jose a good choice for someone who works remotely? ",0,1749910812.0,costarica,9,0.33,False

¬† Something was wrong. I knew it the moment I walked in the door. With one hand I flicked on the light, dumping my purse onto the couch with the other. After the dimly lit hallway, the sudden glare was dazzling. Little lights flashed before my eyes. When they cleared all I saw were spaces ‚Ä¶ spaces where, just this morning, things had been.¬† Like the couch.¬† My purse hit the floor and everything came tumbling out, tampons, loose coins, pens and make-up. A stick of deodorant rolled into the corner. The now empty corner since both the TV and its cabinet were gone. My thrift store retro table and chairs remained, same with my over-flowing book case. But the bulk of the room lay bare.  
¬† ‚ÄúSkye?¬† No answer. What the hell?‚Äù A stupid question, what had happened here was obvious. Across from me, my roommate‚Äôs door stood wide open. Nothing but darkness and dust bunnies in there. No point in denying it.¬† Skye had bailed on me.¬† My shoulders slumped as the weight of two months‚Äô worth of back rent, food and utilities came crushing down upon me. Even my throat closed tight. So this is what it felt like to have a friend f\*\*k you over. I could barely breathe. Anne, can I borrow your velvet coat? I promise I‚Äôll ‚Ä¶‚Äù Lauren, my neighbor from the apartment next door strode in (knocking never had been her style). Then, like me, she stopped dead. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your couch?‚Äù¬† I took a deep breath and let it out slow. It didn‚Äôt help. ‚ÄúI guess Skye took it. ‚Äù¬† ‚ÄúSkye‚Äôs gone?‚Äù  
 My mouth opened, but really, what was there to say?¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs gone and you didn‚Äôt know she was leaving?‚Äù Lauren cocked her head, making her mass of long dark hair swing to and fro. I‚Äôd always envied her that hair. Mine was strawberry blonde and fine. Anything past shoulder length and it hung limp like I‚Äôd stuck my head in a bucket of grease. It‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt tend to let it grow longer than jaw length. Not that hair mattered.  
  
¬† Making rent mattered.  
  
¬† Having food to eat mattered.  
  
¬† Hair styles? Not so much.  
  
¬† My eyes burned, betrayal stung like a bitch. Skye and I had been friends for years. I‚Äôd trusted her. We‚Äôd trash talked boys and shared secrets, cried on each other‚Äôs shoulders. It just didn‚Äôt make sense.  
  
¬† Except it did.  
  
¬† It so very painfully did.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. ‚Äù My voice sounded strange. I swallowed hard, clearing my throat. ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt know she was leaving. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWeird. You two always seemed to get along great. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy would she take off like that?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe owed me money,‚Äù I admitted, kneeling to collect the contents of my purse. Not to pray to God. I‚Äôd given up on him a long time ago.  
  
¬† Lauren gasped. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre joking. That f\*\*king bitch!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBabe, we‚Äôre running late. ‚Äù Nate, my other next door neighbor, filled the door way, eyes impatient. He was a tall well-built guy with an edge. Normally, I envied Lauren her boyfriend. Right then the glory of Nate was lost on me. I was so f\*\*ked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù he asked, looking around. ‚ÄúHey, Anne. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi, Nate. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your shit?‚Äù  
  
¬† Lauren threw her hands in the air. ‚ÄúSkye took her shit!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I corrected. ‚ÄúSkye took her shit. But she took my money. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow much money?‚Äù Nate asked, displeasure dropping his voice by about an octave.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been covering for her since she lost her job. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù muttered Nate.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah. ‚Äù Seriously, yeah.  
  
¬† I picked up my purse and flipped it open. Sixty-five dollars and one lone shiny quarter. How had I let it get this far? My pay check from the book shop was gone and my credit card maxed. Lizzy had needed help yesterday paying for textbooks and no way would I turn her down. Getting my sister through college came first.  
  
¬† This morning I‚Äôd told Skye we needed to talk. All day I‚Äôd felt crappy about it, my stomach churning. Because the truth was, the sum total of my talk involved telling her that she needed to ask her parents, or her fancy ass new boyfriend, for a loan to pay me back. I couldn‚Äôt keep the both of us housed and fed any longer while she searched for a new job. So she also needed to talk to one of them about a place to stay. Yes, I was kicking her to the curb. The guilt had weighed in my stomach like a stone.  
  
¬† Ironic really.  
  
¬† What were the chances of her feeling any remorse for screwing me over? Not likely.  
  
¬† I finished retrieving the contents of my handbag and zipped it up tight. ‚ÄúAh, yeah, Lauren, the coat‚Äôs in my closet. At least I hope it is. Help yourself. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Rent was due in eight days. Maybe I could work a miracle. There were sure to be some cash savvy twenty-three year olds with savings in the bank out there. At least one of them must need a place to stay? I‚Äôd been doing fine before this. But there‚Äôd always been something my sister or I needed more than future financial stability. Books, clothes, a night on the town, all those little treats that made living worthwhile. We‚Äôd sacrificed enough already. Yet here I was, broke and on my knees.  
  
¬† Guess I should have prioritized better. Hindsight sucked.  
  
¬† Worst case scenario, I could probably get away with sleeping on the floor of Lizzy‚Äôs dorm room if we were super sly. God knows our mom didn‚Äôt have the cash. Asking her for help was out. If I sold my great-aunt‚Äôs pearls it might help toward the deposit on another apartment, a smaller one that I could afford on my own.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd fix this somehow. Of course, I would. Fixing shit was my specialty.  
  
¬† And if I ever saw Skye again I was going to f\*\*king kill her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôll you do?‚Äù asked Nate, lounging against the door frame.  
  
¬† I rose to my feet, dusting off the knees of my black pants. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll work something out. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Nate gave me a look and I returned it as calmly as I could. The next thing to come out of his mouth had better not be pity. My day had been crappy enough. With great determination, I gave him a smile. ‚ÄúSo, where are you guys off to?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúParty at David and Ev‚Äôs,‚Äù Lauren answered from inside my room. ‚ÄúYou should come with us. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Ev, Nate‚Äôs sister and Lauren‚Äôs former roomie, had married David Ferris, premier rock god and lead guitarist for the band Stage Dive, a few months ago. Long story. I was still trying to get my head around it, frankly. One minute, she‚Äôd been the nice blonde girl next door who went to the same college as Lizzy and made killer coffee at Ruby‚Äôs Caf√©. The next, our apartment block had been surrounded by paparazzi. Skye had given interviews on the front step‚Äînot that she‚Äôd known anything. I‚Äôd snuck out the back.  
  
¬† Mostly, my relationship with Ev had involved saying hi when we‚Äôd passed on the stairs, back when she used to live here, and with me hitting Ruby‚Äôs Caf√© every morning for a big-ass coffee on my way to work. We‚Äôd always been friendly. But I wouldn‚Äôt say we were friends exactly. Given Lauren‚Äôs penchant for borrowing my clothes, I knew her much better.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe should come, right, Nate?‚Äù  
  
¬† Nate grunted his affirmation. Either that or his disinterest. With him it was kind of hard to tell.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I demurred. Debris lined the walls where the couch and cabinet had stood; all of the collected crap Skye had left behind. ‚ÄúI had a new book to read, but I should probably get busy cleaning. Guess we hadn‚Äôt dusted under the furniture for a while. At least I won‚Äôt have much to move when the time comes. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome with us. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLauren, I wasn‚Äôt invited,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNeither are we half the time,‚Äù said Nate.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúT  
hey love us! Of course they want us there. ‚Äù Lauren reemerged from my room and gave her boyfriend the stink eye. She looked better in the black vintage jacket than I ever would, a fact that I chose not to secretly hate her for. If that didn‚Äôt earn me points into heaven then nothing would. Maybe I‚Äôd give it to her as a good-bye present before I left.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on, Anne,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEv won‚Äôt mind. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood to go?‚Äù Nate jiggled his car keys impatiently.  
  
¬† Hanging with rock stars didn‚Äôt seem the appropriate response to learning you‚Äôd soon be out on the street. Maybe one day when I was at my sparkling, buffed-up best I could strut on by and say hi. That day was not today. Mostly I felt tired, defeated. Given I‚Äôd been feeling that way since I turned sixteen, it wasn‚Äôt the strongest of excuses. Lauren didn‚Äôt need to know that, however.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks, guys,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut I only just got home. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUm, honey, your home kind of sucks ass right now,‚Äù said Lauren, taking in my dust bunnies and lack of d√©cor with a sweeping glance. ‚ÄúBesides, it‚Äôs Friday night. Who sits at home on a Friday night? You wearing your work gear or jumping into jeans? I‚Äôd suggest the jeans. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLauren‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut‚Äì‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. ‚Äù Lauren grasped my shoulders and looked me in the eye. ‚ÄúYou have been f\*\*ked over by a friend. I have no words to tell you how furious that makes me. You‚Äôre coming with us. Hide in a corner all night if you want. But you‚Äôre not sitting here alone dwelling on that thieving ho. You know I never did like her. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Stupidly, I did. Or had. Whatever.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I say that, Nate?‚Äù  
  
¬† Nate shrugged and jangled his keys some more.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGo. Get ready. ‚Äù Lauren gave me a push in the general direction of my bedroom.  
  
¬† In my current situation, this might be my only opportunity to meet David Ferris. Ev still showed up here now and then, but I‚Äôd never seen him, despite occasionally ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù on the steps just in case. He wasn‚Äôt my absolute favorite out of the four members of Stage Dive. That honor was reserved for the drummer, Mal Ericson. A few years ago, I‚Äôd crushed on him something hard. But still ‚Ä¶ the David Ferris. For the chance to meet even just one of them, I had to go. A few years ago, I‚Äôd had a bit of a thing for the band. Nothing to do with their being buff rock gods. No, I was a musical purist.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAlright, give me ten minutes. ‚Äù It was the absolute minimum time frame within which I could mentally, if not physically, prepare myself to face the rich and famous. Fortunately, my care factor was now dangerously close to f\*\*k-it levels. Tonight would probably be the best time to meet Mr. Ferris. I might actually manage to keep my cool and not be an awestruck waste of space.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFive minutes,‚Äù said Nate. ‚ÄúThe game will be starting. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWould you relax?‚Äù asked Lauren.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. ‚Äù The man made a snapping sound and Lauren giggled. I didn‚Äôt look back. I didn‚Äôt want to know. The walls here were disgustingly thin so Lauren and Nate‚Äôs nocturnal mating habits weren‚Äôt much of a secret. Happily I was usually at work during the day. Those hours were a mystery to me, and not one that I pondered.  
  
¬† Oh, alright. Occasionally I pondered because I hadn‚Äôt gotten anything non-self-induced in a while. Also, apparently I had some repressed voyeuristic tendencies in need of addressing.  
  
¬† Was I really up to a night of watching couples rubbing against one another?  
  
¬† I could call Reece, though he‚Äôd said he had a date tonight. Of course, he always had a date. Reece was perfect in every way apart from his man-whore tendencies. My best guy friend liked to spread his love around, to put it mildly. He seemed to be on a conjugal-related first-name basis with the better part of the straight Portland female population aged eighteen to forty-eight. Everyone except me, basically.  
  
¬† Which was fine.  
  
¬† There was nothing wrong with just being friends. Though someday I truly believed we‚Äôd make a great couple. He was just so easy to be around. With everything we had in common, we could go the distance. In the meantime, I was content to wait, do my own thing. Not that lately I‚Äôd been doing anything or anyone, but you get what I mean. Reece would listen to me whine about Skye. He‚Äôd probably even cancel his date, come over, and keep me company while I moped. He would, however, definitely say ‚ÄúI told you so. ‚Äù When he‚Äôd found out I‚Äôd been covering for her, he hadn‚Äôt been happy. He‚Äôd outright accused her of using me. Turned out he‚Äôd been 110 percent right on that score.  
  
¬† The wound, however, was too raw to be prodded and poked. So ‚Ä¶ no Reece. In all likelihood, Lizzy would give me the exact same ass kicking Reece had. Neither had been a fan of the save Skye plan. Decision made. I‚Äôd go to the party and have fun before my world turned to shit.  
  
¬† Excellent. I could do this.  
  
¬† CHAPTER TWO  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt do this.  
  
¬† David and Ev lived in a luxury condo in the Pearl District. The place was sprawling, taking up half the top floor of a beautiful old brown brick building. It must have been surreal for Ev, going from our poky, drafty, thin-walled building to this sort of splendor. It must have been awesome. The old apartment building sat on the edge of downtown, close to the university, but David and Ev lived smack-dab in the middle of the very cool and expensive Pearl District.  
  
¬† Happily, Ev seemed delighted to see me. One potentially awkward moment negated. Mr. Ev, the rock star, gave me a chin tip in greeting while I did my best not to stare. I itched to ask him to sign something. My forehead would do.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHelp yourself to anything in the kitchen,‚Äù said Ev. ‚ÄúThere are plenty of drinks and pizza should be here soon. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou live next to Lauren and Nate?‚Äù asked David, speaking for the first time. Good lord, his dark hair and sculpted face were breathtaking. People shouldn‚Äôt be so greedy; was it not enough that he was insanely talented?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI used to be Ev‚Äôs neighbor and I‚Äôm a regular at Ruby‚Äôs Caf√©. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEvery morning without fail,‚Äù said Ev with a wink. ‚ÄúDouble shot skinny latte with a hit of caramel coming right up. ‚Äù  
  
¬† David nodded and seemed to relax. He slipped an arm around his wife‚Äôs waist and she grinned up at him. Love looked good on her. I hoped they lasted.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd loved, really loved, four people in my lifetime. They weren‚Äôt all romantic love, of course. But I‚Äôd trusted my heart to all of them. Three had failed me. So I figured there was a twenty-five percent chance for success.  
  
¬† When David and Ev started sucking face, I took it as my cue to go explore.  
  
¬† I grabbed a beer from the kitchen (state of the art and beyond fancy) and faced the big living room with renewed determination. I could totally do this. Socializing and me were about to be best buds. A couple dozen people were scattered around the place. A huge flat screen blared out the game and Nate sat dead center in front of it, enraptured. There were a few faces amongst the crowd that I recognized; most belonged to people I‚Äôd never dare approach. I took a sip of beer to wet my parched throat. Being the odd one out at a party is a unique sort of torture. Given today‚Äôs events, I lacked the courage to start a conversation. With my talent for picking who to trust, I‚Äôd probably ask the only axe murderer in the room for his sign.  
  
¬† Lauren gestured to me to join her right when my cell starting buzzing in my back jeans pocket. My butt cheek vibrated, giving me a thrill. I waved to Lauren and pulled out my cell, walking quickly out onto the balcony to escape the noise and chatter. Reece‚Äôs name flashed on the screen as I shut the balcony doors.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, smiling.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDate canceled on me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a shame. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you up to?‚Äù  
  
¬† Wind whipped up my hair, making me shiver. Typical weather for Portland at this time of year‚ÄìOctober could definitely get cold, wet, dark, and miserable. I huddled down deeper into my blue woolen jacket. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at a party. You‚Äôre going to have to entertain yourself. Sorry. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA party? What party?‚Äù he asked, the interest in his voice moving up a notch.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOne I wasn‚Äôt exactly invited to, so I can‚Äôt extend the offer to you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDamn. ‚Äù He yawned. ‚ÄúNever mind. Might get an early night for a change. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood idea. ‚Äù I wandered over to the railing. Cars rushed by on the street below. The Pearl District was a mecca of bars, caf√©s, and general coolness. Plenty of people were out and about braving the weather. All around me, the city lights broke up the darkness and the wind howled. It was lovely in a moody, existential-crisis sort of way. No matter the weather, I loved Portland. It was so different from back home in southern California, something I appreciated immensely. Here the houses were built for snow and ice instead of sunshine. The culture was weirder, more lenient in ways. Or maybe I just had a hard time remembering any of the good regarding my hometown. I‚Äôd escaped. That was all that mattered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI should go be social, Reece. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou sound off. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù  
  
¬† Groan. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk tomorrow at work. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk now. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLater, Reece. I need to put on my happy face and go make Lauren proud. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnne, cut the shit. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù  
  
¬† I screwed up my face and took another sip of beer before answering. We‚Äôd been working together for almost two years now. Apparently, plenty of time for him to figure out my tells. ‚ÄúSkye‚Äôs gone. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood. About time. She pay you back?‚Äù  
  
¬† I let my silence do the talking.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFuuuuck. Anne. Seriously. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat did I tell you?‚Äù he snarled. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I say‚Äì‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúReece, don‚Äôt go there. Please. At the time, I thought it was the right thing to do. She was a friend and she needed help. I couldn‚Äôt just‚Äì‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, you could. She was f\*\*king using you!‚Äù  
  
¬† I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. ‚ÄúYes, Skye was f\*\*king using me. You were right, I was wrong. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He mumbled a long string of expletives while I waited mostly patiently. No wonder I hadn‚Äôt wanted to have this conversation. There‚Äôd never be a good way to spin such a shitty tale. Frustration boiled up inside of me, warming me against the cold.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow much do you need?‚Äù he asked, voice resigned.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat? No. I‚Äôm not borrowing money off you, Reece. Getting further into debt is not the answer. ‚Äù Besides, business owner or not, I wasn‚Äôt sure he had it to spare. Reece wasn‚Äôt any better at saving than I was. I knew this because of the designer gear he wore to work on a daily basis. Apparently being Portland‚Äôs resident Mr. Lover-Lover required one hell of a wardrobe. To be fair, he wore it extremely well.  
  
¬† He sighed. ‚ÄúYou know, for someone who‚Äôs always helping others, you‚Äôre shit at accepting help yourself. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll figure something out. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Another pained sigh. I leaned over the railing and hung my head, letting the cold, wet wind batter my face. It felt nice, offsetting the tension headache threatening to start up behind my forehead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to hang up now, Reece. They have beer and pizza here. I‚Äôm pretty sure if I try hard enough I can find my happy place. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to lose the apartment, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely I‚Äôll have to move, yes. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStay with me. You can crash on my sofa. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs sweet of you. ‚Äù I tried to laugh, but the noise that came out was more of a strangled cough. My situation sucked too much for humor. Me sleeping on Reece‚Äôs couch while he went hard at it in the next room with some stranger. No. Not happening. As it was, I felt small and stupid for letting Skye play me. Bearing witness to Reece‚Äôs oh-so-active sex life would be too much.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks, Reece. But I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôve done unspeakable things to many, many people on that couch. I‚Äôm not sure anyone could sleep there. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs haunted by the ghosts of coitus past?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He snorted. ‚ÄúMy gross sofa is there if you need it, okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you. I mean that. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCall me if you need anything. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBye, Reece. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, hey, Anne?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan you work Sunday? Tara‚Äôs had something come up. I told her you‚Äôd cover for her. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI spend Sundays with Lizzy,‚Äù I said carefully. ‚ÄúYou know that. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Reece‚Äôs answer was silence.  
  
¬† I could actually feel the guilt slinking up on me. ‚ÄúWhat if I do a different shift for her? Is it something she can move?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAh, look, never mind. I‚Äôll deal with it. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo problem. Talk to you later. ‚Äù  
  
¬† And he hung up on me.  
  
¬† I put away my cell, took another mouthful of beer, and stared out at the city. Dark clouds drifted across the crescent moon. The air seemed colder now, making my bones ache like I was an old woman. I needed to drink more. That would solve everything, for tonight at least. My beer, however, was almost finished and I hesitated to head back inside.  
  
¬† Ugh.  
  
¬† Enough of this.  
  
¬† Once the drink was done, my lonely-girl pity party was up. I‚Äôd quit lurking in the shadows, pull my head out of my ass, and go back inside. This was an opportunity not to be missed, like I hadn‚Äôt wished a million times or more to cross paths with someone from the band. I‚Äôd already met David Ferris. So there, wishes could come true. I should put in a request for bigger boobs, a smaller ass, and better choice in friends while I was at it.  
  
¬† And money enough to pay for my sister‚Äôs college education and to keep a roof over my head, of course.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWant another?‚Äù a deep voice asked, startling me. My chin jerked up, eyes wide. I‚Äôd thought I was alone but a guy sat slouched in the corner. Wavy, shoulder-length blond hair shone dully but the rest of him remained in shadow.  
  
¬† Whoa.  
  
¬† No. It couldn‚Äôt be him.  
  
¬† I mean it could be, of course. But it couldn‚Äôt be, surely.  
  
¬† Whoever he was, he had to have heard my half of the phone conversation, which was more than enough to mark me out as being one of the great idiots of our time. There was the clink and hiss of a beer being opened then he held it out to me. Light from inside reflected off the perspiration on the bottle, making it gleam.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks. ‚Äù I stepped closer, close enough to make him out even with the low lighting, and reached for the beer.  
  
¬† Holy shit. It was him, Malcolm Ericson.  
  
¬† The pinnacle moment of my life was officially upon me. So I might have had one or two photos of Stage Dive on my bedroom wall when I was a teenager. Fine, maybe there were three. Or twelve. Whatever. The point is there was one poster of the whole band. At least, the photographer probably thought it was of the whole band. Jimmy was out in front, his face contorted as he screamed into the microphone. To his right, half shrouded in shadow and smoke, was David, smoldering over his guitar. And to the left, toward the front of the stage, stood the bulk that was Ben, playing his bass.  
  
¬† But they didn‚Äôt matter. Not really.  
  
¬† Because behind them all, there he was with the lights shining up through his drum kit. Naked from the waist up and dripping sweat, the picture had caught him mid-strike. His right arm cut across his body, his focus on his target, the cymbal he was about to strike. To smash.  
  
¬† He played with abandon and he looked like a god.  
  
¬† How many times after a day of looking after my mother and sister, working hard and doing the good, responsible thing, had I lay on my bed and looked at that photo. And now here he was.  
  
¬† Our fingers grazed in the way that‚Äôs pretty much inevitable during such a hand over. No way could he have failed to miss the trembling in mine. Thankfully, he didn‚Äôt comment. I scurried back to my place by the edge, leaning casually with a beer in hand. Cool people leaned. They looked relaxed.
