1qukpvy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qukpvy,"Day 2 of Inherited Grooves: 2026 Daily Vinyl from My Late Parents' Collection - Album: Sparkle, Artist: Aretha Franklin, released 1976","Day 2 of Inherited Grooves: 2026 Daily Vinyl from My Late Parents' Collection - Album: Sparkle, Artist: Aretha Franklin, released 1976

The soundtrack for the motion picture \*Sparkle\* was released in April 1976. My husband doesn’t distinctly remember his mom playing Aretha during his childhood. His best guess is that Aretha was someone his mom listened to quietly, on her own.

What we do know is this: in April of 1976, my 25-year-old mother-in-law was three months pregnant with her first child (my husband’s older brother). She and my father-in-law were living in Fulda, West Germany, where the U.S. Army had stationed him to guard the Fulda Gap. During the Cold War, the Fulda Gap was considered one of the most likely routes for a potential Soviet invasion from East Germany, and the area was heavily fortified as a deterrent.

In the absence of my husband’s memories - and drawing from the stories my mother-in-law shared with me about her time in Germany - this is the picture my head canon fills in: I imagine her seeing her husband off to work in the morning. After a long day of keeping house, she props her swollen legs on the orange upholstered stool in front of her favorite chair, closes her eyes, and savors a hot cup of coffee while this record plays.

I’ve only ever seen a portion of the original \*Sparkle\*, and I never had much interest in the 2012 remake. But after spending time with this soundtrack, I’m going to make a point to finally watch the film. A fun fact I learned today while telling my mother about this listening project: \*Sparkle\* was the first movie she ever saw in a theater without her parents. I jokingly asked if she skipped school to see it. She told me she and her friend Amelia went on the weekend it was ""a good time."" My mother was 14 years old and desperately dreaming of becoming a singing star.",1,1770100686.0,u_Mommyof2Muggles,0,1.0,False
1quko2f,https://i.redd.it/i30zf9om58hg1.jpeg,This was disappointing!,"Tried Naivo after reading rave reviews here, but for some reason this one didn’t quite work for me. The taste felt rather generic. Like something you’d get from just about any light roast at a cafe. Could be a matter of taste I suppose, but I don’t think I’ll be ordering it again.

Also, I’d ordered this thinking it was Rs 550, which I felt was reasonable. When it arrived, I realised that was the price for just 100g of beans 😭 (and not the usual 250g). So yeah, that was another issue.

That said, the brew that worked best for me was:

17g / 255 ml, two blooms (the first at 50°C), followed by a single pour. Medium fine grind.

Has anyone else tried it?

P.S: Have also ordered Balanoor Chandragiri. I'm hoping I like that one better.

I'm 28, I've had T for 3.5 years (the good thing is that it's only T and not hyperacusis, noxacusis, or other issues). The cause seems to be genetics (my whole mother's side of the family has tinnitus or moderate to severe hearing loss, even in their 30s or 40s) and well, it doesn't help that I listened to very loud music with earbuds through all my teenage years and early adult life (also I'm a musician, but played only few times live, lots of rehearsals though, off course that ended when I got T).

I've been taking care of my ears by wearing earplugs in any environment louder than \~75 dB since I got T, and I haven't attended concerts or loud gigs.

Despite this, my T has worsened over time. It increases by about 0.5 to 1 point per year on a 1–10 scale. It started at around 2/10, and now it's about 5.5/10.

The only things that probably keep making it worse are that I drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes about once a month, so I will stop drinking and smoking for all of 2026 to see if it keeps getting louder or at least stays where it is now (other factor could be that I drink green tea everyday, caffeine it's not recommended for T, although, green tea has very little of it, much less than coffee, so idk).

In summary, I plan to:

* Stop drinking alcohol.
* Stop smoking.
* Reduce my intake of refined flours, high glycemic index carbohydrates (rice, noodles, etc.), sodium, and sugar by half.
* Exercise every 2 or 3 days.

I’ll let you know how it goes after 1 month, 2 months, and so on, if you're curious. Posting this here helps me stay committed lol.

Thank you for reading, and I wish you strength in facing your hearing problems. Don’t give up!",1,1770099857.0,tinnitus,0,1.0,False

M here, above 25. Looking for a few people to do chill, everyday stuff with — coffee chats, gym sessions, hikes, casual runs.

I’m fairly active, not super hardcore, and enjoy having company for these things instead of doing everything solo all the time. Also always down for coffee and decent conversation.

I tend to vibe better with female company, but keeping things chill and respectful. Preferably 25+ so we’re roughly in the same life stage.

I spent six and a half years with one man. I loved him with everything. I found out today he was cheating the last few weeks. When I confronted him, he said that he has been miserable the entire six years we've been together.

He came by to see our kids. He told me he still loves me and tried to hug me, but said I make him miserable. He said he wants to take care of my needs and the kids' needs, but not be with me. When I told him I can change, he said no that I'd be miserable and he doesn't want a miserable partner. When I asked how, he wouldn't answer.

He is supposed to come by every single day. How can I heal? How can I function? I can't do this.

He has already replaced me. It would be so easy to take all my pills. My stomach is empty. I could drink these two monsters, some coffee, and a tea... just swallow every pill I have... and let go... I could lock myself in the bathroom, turn on the shower, and lay there. I could. It wouldn't be so bad to go to sleep in the shower and never wake up. It would be so easy. No healing required. No pain. Just take all the anxiety pills I own and sleep.

My two girls... they are so beautiful... I could give them some kisses, say goodnight, write a little letter telling them to split up my Pokémon and art supplies evenly between themselves, tell them how much I love them, then let my now ex and his new girlfriend take over. It wouldn't be so bad. I'm so easily replaceable. The girls would like having a new mommy. No more stupid trans daddy to confuse them. Just a regular mommy and a regular daddy to make them actually happy. They'd be so happy without me. So content to have a normal family.

My mom would move on. My friends would soon forget. All I'd have to do is go to sleep. Just sleep forever. It wouldn't be so bad.",1,1770099326.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

1quka7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1quka7o/35_m4f_online/,35 [M4F] #Online - __________,"There's a stark difference between being twenty and a thirty something. Intimacy is redefined from carnal joys in twenties, to having someone to share coffee with each morning, and gaze into each other's eyes every now and then. 

You looking into my eyes, tell me, ""Hey, I'm here for you babe, for anything you need ..."". And me looking back into your eyes, is my way of saying, ""I know you are an independent woman, my love, but I'm gonna protect you nonetheless; I have your back regardless""

Sometimes you don't need gifts. All you need is presence - physical or virtual; the idea of falling asleep with someone over a FaceTime call, by slowly drowning through slow mundane conversation about ourselves, the world and everything in-between ... that's the pure joy of being with someone. 

I believe in two things - there's nothing that can't be solved/fixed by sitting down and talking things through. This demands two people willing to have an open/honest communication channel, that stays open, regardless of mess life throws at those two people. What's the other thing, you may wonder? - If you are with someone, and turn out to be incrementally better today than what you were last monday ... that's the relationship you wanna be in.

Granted societal expectations and cultural differences might be at play, to stop keeping from two strangers like you and me in being together, or even closing the distance. Or there might be a difference of night-and-day between our hobbies/interests/ideas/perspectives ... ... ... and whatnots. But if we are aligned with our core values and commitment to keep four things pristine: trust, loyalty, kindness and understanding - that's a solid foundation for something between two people. Everything else becomes secondary. 

I can reveal my funnier soul, the hint of sarcasm I pepper on you, that intelligence which I'm unwilling to share with anyone but you, and finally, let my guard down to let you see the vulnerable me ... ... ... once I know that I can put a faith in us being together for a long haul.

Mark the tag in the title *#Online* - because that's how it's gonna be early on. If we can get past each other's differences in outlook towards life, timezones/accents, interests, goals/ambitions ... ... ... while resonating with each other's commonality, well, that's when things get easier. Who doesn't love that initial rush of dopamine from novelty of knowing someone new? But what would define us, being each other's besties in life, is whether we can pick what other person is thinking or wanting, even in silences that we share.

1quk9dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1quk9dv/i_took_a_night_train_to_moscow_something_went/,I Took a Night Train to Moscow. Something Went Terribly Wrong.,"I’m writing this from a hotel room in Moscow.
At least, I think I am.

Late one evening, I boarded a train from Yekaterinburg to Moscow. Nothing unusual — I found my seat, put my bag away, and fell asleep almost immediately.

I woke up just before dawn.

The carriage was empty.

Not quiet. Not “everyone got off at a station.”
Empty in a way that felt *wrong*. No bags. No coats. No lingering warmth from other passengers. Just me — and the steady rhythm of the wheels on the tracks.

I assumed I’d wandered into the wrong car, so I walked toward the dining car.

I walked through **every single carriage**.

No passengers.
No conductors.
No staff.

When I returned to my seat, my phone said we’d arrive at the next station in a few minutes. I decided to wait. Surely someone would be there.

The train pulled into a city.

That’s when fear really set in.

No cars. No people. No lights. The station was completely dark. And yet the city felt… familiar. Not in a specific way — more like a deep, unsettling déjà vu, as if I had been there before. Many times.

I stepped off the train.

The city was small. Silent. Frozen in time. After wandering for a couple of hours, I returned to the station. The train was still there. Doors open. Waiting.

The moment I sat down, it started moving.

By then I was painfully hungry. As I searched the train again, I heard a sound coming from a nearby compartment. I opened the door.

A table was set inside.

Food. So much food.
The only drink was coffee.

I didn’t question it. I ate like I hadn’t eaten in days. When I turned away — the food was gone. Completely.

I fell asleep.

The next morning, everything was the same.

The same station.
The same city.

This time, I tried to escape. I walked straight toward the forest and didn’t turn back. After three or four hours, I saw it again.

The train.

Later, I found something like a bar in the city. I don’t know where it came from. Inside, food appeared the same way it had before — suddenly, silently. And again, only coffee to drink. I ate and fell asleep right there.

When I woke up, I ran to the station, hoping the train would be gone.

It wasn’t.

Days passed. I stopped counting. Until I realized the train had been moving for **30 days**.

**Day 31.**

I went to the front of the train. No engineer. The control levers wouldn’t move — as if they were welded in place. Then one of them began to move **on its own**.

The train slowed down.

We arrived at a different station.

Rails stretched across a lake. An enormous oasis. A forest of impossibly tall oak trees surrounded everything. The platform seemed to float above the water.

I stepped out — and saw someone **boarding the train**.

I followed him, but the moment he entered a compartment, he vanished. All that remained was a note.

*“Look for the staircase to the sky.”*

When I stepped back onto the platform, the train left **without me**.

A boat rocked gently on the water. I got in, and it began moving by itself. The forest parted, the ground shifted, and it felt like I was floating along a river that shouldn’t exist.

We stopped at a stone pier. There was a door with a cipher on it. I realized it was a Caesar cipher. After cracking it, I went inside.

I walked through darkness until I saw light.

There was nothing there — except a spiral staircase leading upward.

I climbed for fifteen minutes. At the top was a hatch. I opened it and was blinded by light.

I was standing on an unfamiliar station.

Behind me, a completely empty train pulled away.

In my pocket was my ticket:
**Yekaterinburg — Moscow.**
Train No. 58.

Then another train arrived.

This one was full of people. Talking. Laughing. Alive.

I got on.

I made it to Moscow.

Now I’m here, writing this.
But sometimes I think that if I fall asleep on a train again…
I’ll hear that familiar rhythm of the tracks.

And wake up in an empty carriage.

**“It answers to stillness, not orders”**

Feebee’s QI when asked about the Seed-arc

 

Chen was visibly shaken.  He turned to his 2iC. ""We'd fit in one of the engines.""

""Yes Sir. It's huge.""

""And it appeared as soon as we established Silent Protocols?""

""Yes Sir.""

 

Chen walked to one side of the screen, as if that would allow him to see the ship in front of him, side on.

""Size?""

""Can't say. It doesn't register on our sensors. This is the Area of Nothing.""

""The what?""

""The area you asked us to monitor and analyse. Sir.""

""It's hardly nothing is it?""

""No Sir but out sensors cannot see it.""

 

Chen looked to his 2iC who simply shrugged, but then added, ""The scientists are looking into it. All we have on it are visuals at this point.""

 

""Ok. Do nothing aggressive. No weapons, nothing. Yes?""

""Yes Sir."" He looked around the bridge, ""Everyone. Nothing aggressive.""

The 2iC spoke up, ""Should we stop probing them?""

One of the navs laughed and drew a stern look from the 2iC.

""Yes, stop... using sensors. For now. Try and get nearer.""

 

The 2iC was surprised, ""Nearer Sir?""

""Yes. Nearer. If all we have are visuals we need to get nearer so we can see more. Slowly, nothing threatening.""

 

The thought that their ship could in any way threaten this ship was laughable.

 

As they got closer one of the analysts called out to the 2iC.

""Sir. There's a comet on the outside of the ship. That's where the debris that allowed the wake to form came from.""

""And the abnormal signal?""

""As soon as the ship appeared it stopped.""

""Shit,"" was all Chen said.

 

The Measured Response plotted a measured approach towards the ship in front of them.

""Sir. The ship adjusted, it is now matching our velocity.""

 

He spoke quietly to his 2iC, ""I need you to get a handful of volunteers. Go see what this ship is. Use the shuttle.""

 

The 2iC hesitated for a second, *Hhmm, looks like I volunteered. Again.*

 

Before he could respond, one of the analysts called across the bridge, ""There seems to be a docking area and airlocks near the comet. Should we get nearer?""

 

Chen looked to his 2iC. With a sigh the 2iC responded to the nav, ""I'll take a shuttle and have a look. Get us near but at a safe distance.""

 

On the way off of the bridge the 2iC told one of the analysts, a pilot and the marine on bridge duty, to follow him. As they walked to the shuttle bay the analyst spoke up.

""This isn't what I signed up for? What happened to calling for volunteers?""

The 2iC laughed, ""It's exactly what you signed up for, and you did volunteer. Review the contract terms when we get back.""

The analyst was not angry, she was actually excited but put up a mock front anyway, ""We never got a copy of the contract.""

""I'll send it to you when we get back.""

 

They wore EVA suits in the shuttle as they crossed the short distance to the ship. It stretched out below them like a small planet. Horizons at two compass points, North and South, very distant. East and West closer.

 

The shuttle extended its docking clamps. Automated systems on the ship reconfigured and reached out to the shuttle. They waited for the reassuring 'clunk' as they grabbed each other.

 

Nothing.

They simply failed to engage, both sets retracting. Zero recognition. The pilot repositioned the shuttle over the clamping mechanism on the ship. And 'pushed' the shuttle onto the clamps.

 

Nothing.

""Ok. Everyone check your suits."" The 2iC continued, ""We'll do this the old way.""

He pointed to the pilot. ""You stay here. You two. With me.""

 

The three of them were tethered together. The marine in the lead, followed by the 2iC and lastly the analyst. Her job was to ensure the tether payed out and as a backup, to ensure that they were attached to the ship’s hull.  It slowed things down but was a lot safer.

 

""You there yet?"" asked Chen.

""Close Sir. It's slow going.""

 

They reached an airlock and saw a big green button. Above the door was a green light.

""Green is good, yes?"" he asked.

The analyst shook her head, ""No. Not really. In my culture it’s a sign of the devil, of witchcraft.""

""That's helpful.""

 

He reached out to the green button and pressed it. The display by the door lit up, it was AMBER and a single word appeared.

 

 

NULL

 

""Sir, we cannot dock with the ship or access it via the airlocks. It's not hostile, there isn't a denial of access. It doesn't see us. Says undefined or null. Just nothing.""

""Stay there. In the shuttle.""

He walked the bridge, hands clasped behind his back. He'd seen important people do this in films or on the vid, when thinking on what to do in tricky situations.

""Have we tried hailing them?""

 

 

 

**Meanwhile**... inside the Seed-arc, Feebee was in the rest room. Talking with the coffee boys. She'd developed a liking for coffee but too much wired her. She sipped her first cup of the day slowly.

 

Without any warning, there was a shift in the chatter around her. Something fundamental just changed.

Not at her level but at the level within which the Seed-arc operated. A level that defines its geometry within the space around it.

 

The QI felt it too and reached out through the Seed-arc's resources.

'There is another ship tracking us.'

Feebee laughed, 'We've done this one before. Is this with the pirates again?' Bench Press and Spotter were doing their usual stuff.

The QI conveyed frustration, 'No. Not everything is a game or a sim. This is real.'

'Oh. Ok. Good.'

 

Feebee reached out and got a view looking out across the Seed-arc hull to the ship running on a parallel course. It was small. Same size as the comet but smaller than the asteroid had been. It had sent an even smaller ship, a shuttle, over to the Seed-arc.

 

'We're being hailed.'

'What do they want?'

The QI sounded amused, 'Someone called Captan Chen. Wants to know what we are, what we are doing, where we are going... I asked him the same.'

Feebee reviewed the available stats on the ship that was tracking them.

'And his response?'

'They are a small survey ship, investigating an abnormal signal and came across us.'

'And that's how they found us. What is the signal's source?'

'They don't know. But it wasn't us. Up until a few minutes ago we were an area of nothing. The seed-arc exposed us for a reason.'

 

'Let me talk to them. Include visuals but make this look more official.'

'Ack.'  The QI ignored her, feeling the informality of the real backdrop better.

 

Chen appeared in her overlays. His voice clear. He was on the bridge of his ship or projecting that as a backdrop.

 

""I am Captain Chen. Do you understand me?""

""Yes. I am Feebee.""

""Feebee what?""

""Feebee Jones."" She waited, inviting Chen to speak next.

 

And waited. Chen was clearly trying to process what he was seeing. A woman in her late teens in military fatigues in a training area. He could see two men in the weights area. It was so not what he had expected that he needed a minute to process it.

 

""Do you command the ship?""

""Yes.

""But you're... you're...""

Feebee cut in, ""Do you command the ship standing off us?""

""Yes. It's called The Measured Response.""

""That is a good name, a strong name.""

Chen's body language relaxed at her response. ""Yes, it is. What is your rank?""

She answered without thinking. ""Army Captain with Level Two Command clearance.""

""I'm not familiar with your command structure?""

""It gives me command and control over most ship functions.""

Chen paused, ""But now we're here we can take control of the ship, provide you with custodial oversight and a security detail. We'd also like to extend the observation window as we return to base.""

The way he spoke was very matter of fact, procedural. Not aggressive but as if it was a forgone conclusion.

 

A strong feeling came over her, one that resonated within her bones. Feebee's response was simple, ""It won't allow that.""

---

**Title:** Has anyone else heard *The Brain Song*? Here’s my honest take. 🧠🎶  

I stumbled across *The Brain Song* a few weeks ago, completely by accident while going down a rabbit hole on music that claims to “boost focus.” I’ll be real with you—I usually roll my eyes at stuff like that. But this one hit differently.  

It’s not your typical “study beat” track. There’s something oddly *human* behind it. It tugs at you—not in a commercialized, overproduced way—but more like it’s whispering to your neurons, “Hey, slow down—breathe—remember you’re alive.” Maybe that sounds dramatic, but that’s exactly what it made me feel.  

I found it here: **[https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)**, and honestly, I’ve gone back several times just to sit with it in different moods. It’s funny how something that sounds so simple can make you reflect this much about your habits, your mental space, and how overstimulated our world’s become.  

Before you brush it off, give it one focused listen—preferably with headphones—and see where your mind goes. I think the creator tapped into something clever about subconscious rhythms and how our brains sync to certain frequencies.  

If you do check it out, here’s the link again: **[https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)**  

I’d love to know what you think afterward. Does it calm you, energize you, irritate you? For me, it’s now part of my morning ritual—one listen before coffee.  

Curious minds, go listen for yourself: **[https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song](https://cashflowmanifest.com/The%20Brain%20Song)**  
You might end up discovering more about your own thinking patterns than you expect.

We haven't been ""together"" in years but I recently told him I'm done there is no fixing it anymore. Anyway, back in December I started talking to this guy 40yo and we hit it off everything from pets, future plans, things we like to do and eat, and we are both very introverted. We met im person for the first time at the beginning of January at a Starbucks, he opened the door and gesture for me to go in ✅️ #1 chivalrous...without even a chance for me to say or do anything he payed for my coffee. ✅️ #2 generous... we sat and talked for hours about everything, it was so easy however it was obvious we were both nervous. Anyway, we hugged and both left, after driving for a little bit I get a text (where do you live?) Had the date not gone as well as it did this could have been creepy... Anyway I gave him a general area and asked why?  He responded, well I'm heading home and I'm right behind you lol... well long story short he lives one street over literally 3 mins from my house. We have seen each other about every other day since, he is vegan and I've made him some homemade hummus, grilled vegetable soup, a vegan French onion soup he has bought me lunch a couple times and coffee, got some special treats for my dogs (he works at pet store). So, basically it couldn't be any better and for those wondering yes we have kissed, and I can feel the ""love"" behind it, it's not just a peck. Anyway here is where the issue comes in..

He told me about an incident that occurred with ex, where long story short he was essentially gang raped, he had contracted syphilis from it. He's fine now and he's on Prep and DoxyPEP now because of it. This conversation happened via text because he was too scared to talk about it to my face, he doesn't know but I was literally crying when he was telling me, I was so hurt for him and I couldn't do anything to help his pain. I reassured him I'm here for him and I'm not just here for the sex (we haven't gotten there yet) I truly want to build a relationship with him. I am ok with waiting and letting him be comfortable with anything we do, I don't wanna do anything to ever make him relive the feelings of that trauma. This in turn has triggered my anxiety because I'm always nervous to touch him. But I'll reach out and touch his hand to hold it and he'll latch right on. But sometimes when I give him a hug it's like he'll just stand there and let it happen for a little bit before he awkwardly reaches back out to hold me then I can feel the squeeze and his tension relax. 

It been about a month since we have started seeing each other and I want to tell him that I would like him to be my boyfriend officially, but I also feel like he's still trying get his feet wet, not really sure how he will respond to it and I don't want him to feel pressured or think we are moving too fast for him, I dont want to scare him off if he's not ready. I know trauma like this can last a long time and I'm OK with being there to help him, I  have told him I want to be a safe space for him, so I dont want to jeopardize being his safe space. 

I don't know how I should approach this or even imagine what thoughts are going through his head because of it. Anyone been through something like this? How would you want to be approached? Any advice?

**AITAH because I want my wife to ""ask permission"" before taking our son on playdates?**

&#x200B;



My wife and I have a two year old. I work Sunday - Thursday (yes, I'm at work right now) 6AM to 3PM. She works Thursday - Sunday 5PM - 11PM. So we make it work.

Here's the problem. When I get off work, I like to spend time with my child. I also like to spend time with my child on my days off. Frequently I will be with our son, and my wife will say they are leaving to go on a playdate with one of her friends. Or I will get home and they are already gone.

I tried to have a conversation with my wife about the playdates. I asked if we could put them in the calendar so I know when they are and maybe carve some specific slots out just for me and our son. I feel like we are being deprived of quality time. She asked why we aren't spending time together while she is at work. I said because his bedtime is at seven. She said that gives us two hours, but that's when I get him ready for bed. She said ""is that not quality time?""

I said I really want time set aside for me and our son. She said sometimes playdates get scheduled last second. I said it's okay to tell her friends no, that we're busy. She said she doesn't need my permission to take our son on a playdate. I said that's not what I said, and she said no, but that I'm saying it without saying it.

She also said that playdates are good for our son and he gets fresh air and socializations, and that all I want to do is sit on the couch with him and watch cartoons and call it ""bonding."" She did the finger quotes. This is not true. On my days off I want to take our son places and do things, but I can't, because she has already claimed that time. We can only do things if we do them early in the morning while she is asleep, which we do, but she doesn't see that and doesn't acknowledge it. Yes, when I have been working all day sometimes I want to watch my favorite childhood cartoons with my son for maybe an hour. Is that terrible?

We're basically stuck. We both think the other is being insanely unreasonable. I want us to talk and figure out a good schedule together. She thinks I'm being controlling. She messaged her friend group chat and sent me screenshots of all her friends saying I'm wrong. I can't do that because I don't want to talk about a fight with my wife to my friends. So what do you guys think?

Update: Since so many of you said I was being too passive I made a calendar and blocked out Friday. I sent it to her and told her I was taking our son to my friend's house to meet his animals. She said no, because there will probably be a playdate. I told her he will have to miss the playdate. She stopped responding for a bit and then sent me screenshots of her friend group chat where there all say I'm a jackass and one even said she should just call the police and report him as kidnapped. 

I said ""don't you think (friend's name) is being a little insane."" She responded ""just please stop trying to control what I do. You have (son's name) when I'm at work. You don't need to have him all day. When you get to (friend's name)'s house you're just going to sit around and watch TV."" I said we're going to meet his animals, and that's the plan, and it's happening. She stopped responding. I assume she's back to the group chat. I also sent her a screenshot of one of the comments here, and she said I was being immature posting online. But her posting to the group chat is very mature I guess.

*The way you all communicate is not normal. I'd start there.*



**Empty_Candidate000**

*They might communicate better as a divorced couple with a custody schedule atp.*


**Less_Is_More_l**

*Seems like they already fight about physical custody of their son. Why can't dad have all Fridays with his son if he wants? Because of a currently non-existent play date? Wife sounds like a nasty piece of work. At least if he was divorced the family court would back him up getting a certain amount of time with his son. She could schedule the all-important play dates on her time.*

*Oh and if you're married, one spouse taking the child somewhere without the other spouse's permission is NOT kidnapping. Some real bright ones on that group chat.*

*My ex was like OPs wife, I wasn’t allowed to spend time with my son without it causing huge strife. He was fine with me spending time with him while he worked but it was more like he was treating me as a nanny than my sons mother.*

*By the time I left him my son was old enough to recognize what was happening and it messed him up. He would want to spend time with me but then he’d feel guilty about it because it “hurt his daddy’s feelings”.*

*It was jealousy and control, full stop. My son eventually gravitated towards me more than my ex and one night it came to a head. My son was wanting to color with me and my ex spat out “what the fuck lies have you been telling him about me? I used to be the favorite parent!”*

*It was so toxic and so bizarre, and it was very much a symptom of a bigger problem. I’m sure if OP were to look at his relationship, there’s other issues where his spouse has to be the one in control or the one who is right, or something where she’s better than op in her mind.*

*In healthy relationships, you both do things separately with the kids so you’re both getting quality relationship building time, and so you’re both getting some child free time to yourself. And you definitely don’t gang up on your partner like that with your group chat, it’s disrespectful af.*

**MakeChai-NotWar**

*Why aren’t you guys doing things as a family the 3 of you sometimes?*

>OOP:
I wish we did more. But she's always with her friends. I try to get her to do things as a trio, and she very rarely agrees. Maybe once or twice a month. And what does she do the whole time? Text her friends.

**Fit_Jellyfish_4444**

*Not sure
Have you tried putting a play date for you and your kid on the calendar so your wife can look and see when you'd like to have a ""slot?""*


>OOP:
She refused the suggestion of the calendar,  but I'm just going to do it anyway. I'm making one right now and am going to send it to her.

**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***

&#x200B;

**Update - 1 day later**

&#x200B;

So I initially posted this morning at work about how I tried to talk to my wife about our kid's schedule. She said I was telling her to ""ask permission"" to take him on playdates. I just wanted us to decide together as a couple, so I can spend more time with our son. She didn't like that.

Most of the responses were really nasty. A lot of people didn't believe the situation or didn't even understand it. At first I was incredibly frustrated. Then I realized the fact that so many people don't even believe this is happening proves how abnormal it is. Several people told me to just make a calendar and send it to her, which I did. Her reaction was very negative. A lot of people also said to just go pick him up from the playdate when I get off work. So I did.

When I got to the park it was empty. This was reasonable, because it's freezing outside. I went into the cafe. My wife was sitting at a table with her friends, drinking coffee. The kids, including our son, were sitting on the floor playing on tablets. Our son doesn't have a tablet, so it must have been a spare from one of the other kids.

I said hello, and my wife had an immediate negative reaction. Her whole body got tense. Her face tightened up. She asked why I was there. I said I came to get our son so we can go home and spend some time together. She said he's on a playdate. I picked him up and took the tablet away, setting it on the table. She got defensive about the tablet, even though I hadn't said anything about it yet. She said it's cold outside. I said yeah, I know. I said we were going to go, but to have fun with her friends. She told me to stop and said I was humiliating her. I said I would see her at home.

When I got home, my son and I spent some time together. We watched one episode of our favorite cartoon and then we played make believe with his toys. We made dinner together and were eating when my wife came home to get ready for work. She said I embarrassed her in front of her friends and accused me of trying to destroy her support network. I said she acccuses me of always wanting to watch TV with our kid, but she had him just sitting on the ground with a tablet. How is that better than watching one episode of a cartoon he and I both like. She said it's because his friends were there. She also kept yelling over and over that it was cold outside, which freaked out our son. She said ""look what you did,"" even though she was the one yelling. I took him to the bathroom and bathed him.

She had already left for work when we were done. I read to him from his storybook, and he went to bed. He's been asleep for an hour and a half. Since my wife gets off work in a couple hours I've just been replaying everything that happened in my mind over and over again. I know she's going to be mad when she gets home. I don't want to fight again. But I have a feeling we are going to fight again.

Update: When my wife came home last night I told her I want counseling. She said no. I told her we can't go on like this, that it isn't fair to our son. She told me I need to work more and leave the parenting to her, because she is the mom. She said if I did my job as a provider, we wouldn't be in the situation we are in. I said that is never going to happen. I said I already work a lot and am not going to do more. If she wants the relationship to improve, we need counseling, because what she thinks is going to make her happy is never going to happen. So we need to work together to find another solution.

She said no again. I asked what she wants to do to work on our marriage. She said she wants me to stop being like this. I asked what she is willing to do for our marriage, or if it is only me that needs to changed. She said it's me. I said then let's get divorced, because neither of us is making the other happy. She said yes. She then wanted me to get out of bed and relocate to the guest room. I said no. She told me I had to. I admit I was a bit of a jerk. I made fun of her and asked if this is different from what her friends said would happen. She started to cry and asked why I was making this difficult. I said I wasn't. She got in bed, and we went to sleep.

As I was leaving for work this morning she came out of our room and said she would do the counseling if I moved out of the house. I said no. She said she'll do it if I move to the guest bedroom. I said no. She said it's customary for the wife to stay and the husband to leave. I told her divorce is whatever the people doing it make it, and her friends lied to her. She said not to talk about her friends like that. I said I could say way worse about her friends, but I have to go to work. She said she would go to the counseling so I can see how wrong I am. I called my insurance half an hour ago, and they emailed me a list of people they cover. I'm working my way down the list now.

*You need couples therapy. If you’re fighting like this in public, you’re really messing your kid up at home. Don’t kid yourself that “your kid doesn’t hear you fight” or some other bs.*



**Upset_Grapefruit4030**

*I am starting to wonder if the wife is territorial about the playdates because it's really her excuse to hang out with her new friends. And perhaps she fears she won't be invited unless her son accompanies her.*



**iamglory**

*Mom groups like that usually require a child*



**Beth21286**

*Not sure why since they all dumped their kids in front of a screen each.*

*OP should just tell her she sorts herself out or he's divorcing her and going for 50/50 custody. She is acting like she makes all the rules here and needs to realise she doesn't. Marriage is a partnership or what's the point.*

**Dry_Bowler_2837**

*I’m the person who asked on your other post about what her friends are like. This update does not settle my concerns about the friends at all.*

*I attended quite a few playdate groups when my kids were small. Once when my second child was a month or two old, my first was staying with the grandparents for the night. My friends said there was a playdate. I said that OlderChild wasn’t around. They said “No problem! Come with just Baby! We still want to see you.” There were also moms in the playgroups who shared custody with exes. We always told them to just come and drink coffee without the kids if they were looking for something to do when the kids were with their dad.*

*Real friends want to see you regardless of if your kid is there or not. Real friends cheer for you to get an hour to socialize without the kids in tow. And REALLY real friends encourage you to communicate with your spouse.*

**Next-Drummer-9280**

*Dude. Your wife HATES you.
Just get a divorce already.*




**Opportunity_Massive**

*Honestly, you might not be far off from the truth. He said she got tense when he showed up, so for whatever reason, she wasn’t happy to see him.
I’d be happy if my husband showed up to take the kids off my hands when I’m chatting with my friends. My kids are older now, but when they were younger, I always enjoyed it when my husband took over the childcare.*

**Successful_Bitch107**

*I wonder if she is constantly shitting on OP being an absent father to her support network - and him showing up to spend time with their son might have cracked some truthful light on her dishonesty to her friends
This is pure conjecture of course, but not out of the question*


>OOP:
I kind of wonder the same thing. She sends me screenshots of stuff they say about me. It can get pretty vile. I have to wonder what she told them to make them feel that way about me.




**gdrom123**

*Sorry but I don’t think she loves or even likes you.*




**Censordoll**

*Bro…… why is she sending you screenshots of shit talking about YOU to HER FRIENDS?!
Dude…. That’s fucking mean — no you know what, that’s evil.
Listen, my husband gets on my fucking nerves, but I would never think to shit talk about him and then send him screenshots just of people’s responses to him! Like that’s next level “I really hate you and I want others to too.”
Why would you even entertain that conversation at all?! Just…. Fuck, OP. Get your own help and get away from her.*



>OOP:
She does it to win arguments.

**The problem:** Most people don't know when opening windows actually cools vs heats their space. They end up running AC because ""opening windows doesn't work.""

**The solution:** Timing matters. Ventilate when outdoor dew point is low and temp is favorable. Seal the house when humidity is high. Simple algorithm based on weather data.

**Impact:** We reduced our cooling energy use significantly just by ventilating smarter. No equipment needed, just better timing.

Chapter 1
My bestie's uncle married me to break a family curse.
""The first wife of the 28th heir will die unnaturally.""
I believed he loved me—but the truth was— he already loved someone else. And to keep her safe, he used me.
The fire wasn't an accident. My death was part of the plan. I was meant to burn alive.
But when it really happened…
He was the one who couldn’t live with it.
--
""Are you up for that?""
Meadow Standen meant to send a manicure invite to her best friend, Phoebe Lawson. But her finger slipped—and the message landed in the inbox of Phoebe's uncle, Maurice Lawson.
He was a 32-year-old man who ran the distinguished Lawson family empire of New York, worth more than 10 billion dollars and renowned for his indifference toward women.
Meadow stared at the sent message, her mind going completely blank. She scrambled to recall the message, but the two-minute window had already passed.
From then on, she became timid, doing everything she could to avoid Maurice.
Then came a business gathering where ran into Maurice, who'd been drugged.
He was leaning against the hallway wall, his tie loosened, the top two buttons of his shirt undone, sharp collarbones exposed.
His breathing was heavy, the corners of his eyes flushed red. The usual cold, unapproachable aura had completely shattered.
Meadow was just about to call for help when her wrist was suddenly seized.
Maurice pulled her into his embrace, his scorching breath hot against her ear, his voice hoarse and ragged.
""Let's do it.""
The words sent a jolt through her entire body.
Everything that followed felt like a ridiculous dream.
Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows of the presidential suite, city lights glittered over the river. Inside, their bodies moved together in fevered rhythm, moans and gasps hanging thick in the air. Maurice was terrifyingly skilled, taking her over the edge again and again, until she was too exhausted to even move a finger.
By dawn, Maurice was fully dressed, back to his usual composed, dignified self. Only the bloodshot corners of his eyes betrayed the night before.
He looked at Meadow, who was curled up under the covers, scared to show her face. He said in a low voice, ""I'll take responsibility.""
Meadow had been afraid of him since childhood. Hearing this, she nearly rolled off the bed in fright.
After that, Meadow started her life on the run.
The first time, she ran back to her parents' house. But the next day, Maurice showed up with wedding gifts. The list of gifts was so long that it could cover the living room floor. At the very bottom was a single handwritten line: ""Mea, marry me.""
The second time, she ran to a bar—neon lights flashing, music pounding. She wore a short, strappy dress, whistling at the hot guys dancing on stage, determined to prove she wasn't some well-behaved good girl. But before she could take a single sip of her drink, the entire bar went dead silent.
Maurice had somehow appeared and now stood at the entrance. His gaze pierced through the crowd and locked precisely on her. Then he walked over and, without a word, scooped her up into his arms, carrying her out of the bar in front of everyone.
The third time, she tried to flee to France. She bought a ticket and was about to board the plane when Maurice stopped her at security. He grabbed her hand and repeated calmly, ""I told you. I'll take responsibility.""
Meadow panicked, her eyes welling up. ""I won't marry you, Maurice. I'm scared of you. I really am!""
He studied her trembling figure in silence for a few seconds.
Then he suddenly leaned down, pressing a soft kiss to her lips. When he pulled back, there was a faint hint of a smile in his eyes.
""We'll keep doing it,"" he whispered in her ear, his warm breath brushing her skin, ""and you won't be scared anymore.""
He truly made good on it.
After their marriage, he spoiled her rotten, denying her nothing.
When she said she wanted breakfast from that old establishment on the west side, he had it flown in daily. When she casually mentioned liking a certain designer's dresses, that designer showed up at their door with the entire new collection the next day. When she woke up crying from a nightmare in the middle of the night, he held her and comforted her until dawn, then went to his international meeting the next day with dark circles under his eyes.
At night, he was a completely different person.
The bedroom, the study, even in front of the living room's floor-to-ceiling windows... he always found ways to leave her flushed, breathless, and completely undone.
He was New York's most distinguished and unapproachable man, yet he gave all his patience and indulgence to her and her alone.
Without realizing it, Meadow fell—deeper and deeper, with no way back.
Then, in their third year of marriage, their villa caught fire.
Maurice was on a business trip that day, leaving Meadow home alone.
The fire started in the kitchen, spreading with terrifying speed. Thick smoke stung her eyes, making it impossible to open them. She called Maurice, but his phone was off.
She called 911. They told her they'd already received the alert. Fire trucks were on the way.
But after a long wait in the blaze, no help ever came. Flames reached the ceiling, the heat searing her skin. She curled up in the bathroom, covering her mouth and nose with a wet towel, her consciousness slowly fading.
Before she blacked out, she thought, ""Maurice, where are you?""
She woke up in a hospital. The sharp scent of disinfectant filled the air. As Meadow opened her eyes, she heard familiar voices outside the door.
It was Maurice, along with a few of his friends.
""Maury, you're cold-blooded, man. That fire was massive. You turned off your phone and even blocked the fire trucks. Were you really trying to fulfill that family prophecy?""
Meadow's body went rigid, her blood turning cold in an instant.
What prophecy?
Someone else present seemed also confused and asked the question. The one in the know sighed, his voice dropping to a low murmur. ""The Lawson family has an old prophecy. The first wife of the 28th-generation eldest son will die an unnatural death. Maury is the 28th generation, isn't he?""
Meadow in bed felt her blood running cold.
She clenched her teeth, holding her breath, terrified of missing a single word.
""So, marrying Meadow back then was just to shield his true love, Stephanie. But it's been three years, and Meadow is still alive. Stephanie couldn't wait any longer. She attempted suicide a few times. Maury had no choice. Then the villa caught fire, and he just went with it. He stopped the fire trucks cold, hoping Meadow would burn to death in the blaze. That way, the prophecy about the unnatural death would be fulfilled. And Maury could finally marry the woman he truly loves.""
""What the hell? Is that for real? The first wife of the Lawson family's 28th-generation eldest son dies an unnatural death? Maury, you believe that kind of thing in this day and age?""
""I don't believe it,"" Maurice's voice finally cut through, cold and flat, giving away nothing. ""But when it comes to Annie, I can't take the risk.""
""But you still ran into the fire and saved Meadow, didn't you?"" his friend pressed. ""You turned your phone off and stopped the fire trucks, but you were the one who ran into the fire and carried her out. Maury, be real. It's been three years. Did you never once feel anything for Meadow?""
""No,"" Maurice cut him off, his voice cold. ""From the start to the end, the only one I ever wanted to marry was Annie.""
Chapter 2
Every word pierced through Meadow, shattering her heart.
Her eyes wide open, she stared at the stark white ceiling. Her ears were ringing, drowning out everything but Maurice's clear, cruel words: ""From the start to the end, the only one I ever wanted to marry was Annie.""
She thought back to the first time she'd met Maurice.
It was her senior year of high school. She was being harassed by some school bullies. She smashed their car. They threatened to call her parents. Meadow was too scared to tell her own, so she begged her best friend Phoebe to ask her family for help. The one who came was Phoebe's uncle, Maurice.
That day, he wore a black overcoat. The moment he stepped out of the car, the entire dean's office fell silent.
His presence was so overpowering that even the principal stood up unconsciously.
The bullies' parents pointed at Meadow, yelling that she had no manners.
After listening to what had happened, Maurice didn't scold Meadow. Instead, he told his bodyguard to hand her a hammer.
He stood behind her, his voice quiet but cutting through all the noise.
""People under my family's protection can break whatever they want. They can even crack open someone's skull. I'll take care of it.""
Meadow did it.
She bashed in the skull of the bully who'd harassed her the longest.
When Maurice took her away from the school, the dean didn't dare utter a single word of protest.
From that day on, Meadow regarded Maurice with a mix of awe and fear.
He seemed impossibly powerful, someone out of her league.
She never dreamed of having any connection to him and avoided him whenever possible.
That text ""Are you up for that?"" was their second interaction.
Everything that followed was like a train hurtling off the tracks.
Wherever she ran, he followed. When she was upset or dejected, he would soothe her and indulge her.
It was her first relationship, her first time giving her heart so completely. She clumsily learned how to love someone.
She remembered all his preferences. Knowing he had a weak stomach, she got up early every day to make him a nourishing breakfast. When he was swamped with work, she taught herself massage to ease his tired muscles after late nights. For his birthday, she prepared a gift six months in advance, scouring half of Europe for a specific painting he wanted.
She thought this was what love was supposed to be like. He doted on her, and she cherished him.
She never imagined it was all a lie from the start.
To him, she was just a human shield, meant to die in place of the woman he truly loved?!
The pain was so intense. Tears poured out, soaking the pillow instantly, but she bit her lip hard, holding back any sob.
Her body ached all over, especially her chest—a cold, hollow weight settled deep inside.
Just then, a nurse's anxious voice came from outside the door, ""Mr. Lawson! Ms. Roswell is extremely agitated. Her wound has reopened, and she keeps calling you!""
Maurice replied, ""I'll be right there.""
Then he seemed to tell his assistant, ""Find the best caregiver for Mrs. Lawson. If she asks about me, tell her I'm abroad dealing with an urgent matter and can't return for now.""
One of his friends let out a low, teasing laugh. ""Alright, now I really believe you don't have feelings for Meadow. When your wife and the woman you love are both in trouble, you don't hesitate to choose.""
Maurice said nothing more. Only his steady yet slightly hurried footsteps faded away.
He was gone—off to Stephanie Roswell's side.
Meadow closed her eyes, tears streaming silently down her cheeks.
What was the use of crying? Could it change the fact that she was a replacement, or erase that vicious prophecy?
No.
So, she would cry no more.
She wiped her tears fiercely. The vulnerability and pain in her eyes were replaced by cold determination.
Whether the prophecy was true or not, she had to leave Maurice immediately, the man she'd loved for three years, who'd lied to her for three years.
She reached for her phone on the nightstand. Her fingers trembled slightly from pain and emotion as she dialed a lawyer's number firmly.
""Mr. Merlin, it's me. I want a divorce. Prepare the divorce papers and start the proceedings as soon as possible. And remember—Maurice must not get wind of this in advance.""
The lawyer on the other end was clearly shocked, but he heard her determination and quickly agreed, ""Yes, Ms. Standen. I'll get on it right away.""
That afternoon, Maurice's assistant arrived, along with a caregiver and a pile of nourishing supplements.
""Mrs. Lawson, Mr. Lawson has an urgent project abroad and won't be back for a while. He specifically told me to find the best caregiver to look after you and make sure you recover.""
Meadow leaned against the headboard, staring at the pile of supplements. She thought back to the past three years—every time she felt even a little unwell, Maurice had done the same, wanting to put the best things in the world right in front of her.
Back then, she'd thought it was love.
Now, it seemed ridiculous.
She said nothing, only responding softly before closing her eyes.
The assistant looked surprised by her calmness, but didn't ask more. He settled the caregiver and left.
Maurice never showed up once during her hospital stay, until the day she was discharged.
Chapter 3
He wore an expensive black overcoat, accentuating his tall, elegant frame. A trace of weariness, barely perceptible, lingered between his brows, but the moment his gaze landed on her, the familiar, doting smile instantly surfaced.
""Mea, I'm sorry. Work kept me tied up for so long."" He walked to the bed, reaching out to ruffle her hair naturally, just like he'd done countless times before.
But Meadow tilted her head slightly, dodging his hand.
Maurice's hand froze mid-air, his eyes darkened for an imperceptible moment before he quickly regained his composure.
""Are you upset I didn't come sooner? There's a charity gala tonight. Let me take you there. It'll help you relax. Consider it an apology. What do you say?""
He tried to soothe her, like calming a grumpy little cat.
Meadow looked at him, the words she'd overheard tearing through her heart. But she couldn't let it show.
If she fell out with him now, she'd never get away.
She lowered her lashes, hiding the surging pain in her eyes, and nodded.
The gala was held in the banquet hall of New York's most luxurious hotel. The place was filled with people in elegant clothes, the air thick with perfume, and the gentle clink of glasses echoed throughout.
Meadow wore a gown Maurice had prepared for her—a white long dress, its hem studded with tiny diamonds that shimmered and sparkled with her every move. It was breathtakingly beautiful. The moment she appeared, many male gazes fell upon her, filled with admiration and desire.
Maurice frowned, taking off his suit jacket and draping it over her shoulders.
Then he whispered something to his assistant.
Soon after, all those stares were gone.
Meadow watched this, her heart turning completely cold.
He clearly didn't love her, so why did he put on such a possessive act?
Was it out of habit, or to maintain his image as a doting husband, making her more willing to be his human shield?
Her fingers trembled with pain, but she clenched her palms tightly, letting her nails dig into her skin, using the sharper, physical pain to maintain a façade of calm.
Just then, the assistant returned, holding an exquisite velvet gift box.
Maurice took it and opened it in front of everyone.
A wave of stifled gasps and low exclamations instantly swept through the room.
""Isn't that the necklace, the final lot at Sotheby's auction earlier this year? It was bought by an anonymous buyer for a sky-high price. So, it was Mr. Lawson!""
""This ... must be worth over one hundred million dollars, right? He's just giving it away?""
""The money is one thing. It's the sentiment! Everyone knows Mr. Lawson used to be indifferent to women. Countless socialites couldn't even get to sit down with him for a coffee. Now, he dotes on Mrs. Lawson to his very core.""
""Mrs. Lawson is so lucky...""
Murmurs of envy and jealousy filled the air.
Maurice bent down to fasten the necklace around her neck. His lips nearly brushed her ear as he whispered the kind of sweet words that used to make her cheeks burn and heart race, ""Mea, only the most beautiful diamond is worthy of you.""
Meadow touched the dazzling, blinding pink diamond around her neck, feeling as if she'd put on a cold shackle. She stood blankly, unable to force even a hint of a smile.
Maurice sensed something was off. He lifted his hand to stroke her cheek, his fingertips warm. ""What's wrong? Don't you like it? Or are you feeling unwell?""
Meadow was about to speak when the banquet hall lights suddenly flicked off with a snap, plunging everything into darkness.
The host's excited voice echoed, ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is our special segment tonight—kissing your true love! All couples here, please share a heartfelt kiss in the dark for three minutes. When the lights come back on, those still locked in an embrace will receive our grand mystery prize!""
A wave of good-natured cheers erupted from the crowd.
Before Meadow could react, a warm hand gently lifted her chin. The familiar, crisp scent enveloped her, and Maurice's lips pressed against hers.
His kissing was as skilled as ever—a blend of gentle insistence and depth that parted her lips with ease, drawing out a lingering, tender response.
Once, she'd gotten lost in it, her heart pounding wildly.
But now, tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.
Maurice pulled back slightly, startled. He brushed his thumb across her tear-stained cheek. ""Why are you crying?""
She was about to answer when a sharp crash echoed from nearby, followed by a tearful shriek.
At the same time, the lights flashed back on, dazzling everyone.
Meadow instinctively looked toward the sound.
A woman stood beside the crystal display table, not far away!
She was extremely beautiful, but her face was pale, her eyes red and filled with tears. She stared straight at Maurice and Meadow, her eyes filled with pain and despair.
She looked at them for a few seconds, then turned and ran.
Maurice's expression changed, and he chased after her at once.
He ran so fast that he knocked into Meadow's shoulder. She stumbled, her forehead slamming into a nearby decorative pillar. Blood gushed out immediately.
A gasp escaped her lips.
But Maurice didn't look back. He didn't even notice she was hurt. His entire focus was on the fleeing figure.
Meadow leaned against the pillar to steady herself, watching his back disappear through the door. A hollow ache settled deep in her heart.
She didn't need to ask. This woman, who could affect him so deeply, must be his true love, Stephanie.
A self-mocking smile touched her lips. She asked a server for antiseptic and a bandage and went to the restroom to tend to the wound herself.
In the mirror, she had a pale face, a bandage on her forehead, and her eyes frighteningly hollow.
After leaving the restroom, she intended to leave directly, but heard familiar voices around the corridor corner.
It was Stephanie crying, ""I can't take this anymore... Maury, just forget it. Let's break up...""
""We're not breaking up. Annie, just wait a little longer."" Maurice's voice held restraint. ""I told you, I don't love her. The only one I want to marry is you.""
""I know! I know you don't love her and that you married her just for that prophecy, so we can be together once she's dead! But it's been three years, and she's still alive. I have to watch you spend millions on diamonds for her, show her public affection, act all lovey-dovey... When I saw you kiss her, I wanted to die right then and there! Maury, let me go. Be happy with her. Let's pretend we never started!""
She struggled to break free, but Maurice held her tighter. He pulled her forcefully into his arms and bent down to kiss her.
""Let me go..."" Stephanie's protests were muffled by the kiss.
Maurice's kiss was domineering and possessive. Stephanie initially beat his shoulders, but her movements slowly weakened, her cries fading into soft whimpers. Finally, her arms wrapped around his neck gently.
The kiss lasted a long time. When they pulled apart, a thin, intimate strand of saliva still connected them.
Chapter 4
Maurice leaned his forehead against Stephanie's. His breathing was slightly uneven, his voice low and soothing. ""Just give me a little more time.""
Stephanie sobbed against his chest. ""Ho",1,1770098550.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

The image captures the fern's expansive fronds radiating outward in a perfect circular, wheel-like pattern from a central trunk, creating a dramatic, symmetrical composition that fills the frame. Each frond is long and arching, divided into numerous delicate, feathery pinnae that are vibrant emerald green, with lighter green undersides and fine, textured edges that give a soft, lacy appearance. Sunlight filters through from above, casting bright golden rays and highlights that illuminate the fronds, emphasizing their translucency and creating glowing halos around the tips. The central trunk is visible at the bottom, rough and brown with fibrous, bark-like texture and small root-like structures emerging, slightly out of focus to draw attention to the overhead canopy. The background fades into deep green shadows, enhancing the sense of depth and immersion in a dense, verdant rainforest environment.

It’s a big Thai coffee chain owned by PTG, and their menu is usually a mix of standard café drinks and Thai-style flavors.

Most branches sell things like espresso drinks (Americano, latte, cappuccino), Thai iced coffee (กาแฟโบราณ), coconut or honey coffee, Thai tea, matcha, chocolate drinks, and some creative stuff like fruit or sparkling drinks. Some branches even sell bakery items or food.

What’s interesting is that certain drinks just disappear after a while, especially the more “special” ones.

Example:

They used to have Mango Coffee as a seasonal drink during summer. After the season ended, it was gone. My guess is because mango is seasonal, costs go up outside the harvest period, and people probably stop ordering it once the season is over.

From what I can tell, the usual reasons are:

 • The drink doesn’t sell well enough

 • Ingredients cost too much

 • Seasonal or hard-to-source ingredients

 • Keeping things simple so service stays fast

1quju23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1quju23/astral_projection_tales/,Astral Projection Tales,"I discovered astral projection in my second year of college. I've been a mystic and a seer my whole life, but I never experienced astraling (I call it astraling, lol) until one day I was just meditating in my room and suddenly I was also standing in my roommates room next to mine. I think its because I could hear her watching tv and my spirit self wandered into her room to see what she was watching. It lasted just a few seconds and, when I realized what was happening, I snapped back into my body and I immediately ran to her door and went in to see if she was watching the show that I saw her watching and indeed she was. 

After that experience, I started researching astraling more indepth and discovered how to do it intentionally. I found a particularly great meditation for astraling if anyone wants me to share it in another post, but as I kept doing it I found out I could astral just by simply willing it to happen, I just set the intention and it would work, even if it didn't happen right away it would happen the next day or a few days later without having to do the meditation. 

One of my favorite astral projection experiences was totally accidental, I fell asleep and suddenly I was flying down the street at night and smiling happily, I've had lots of flying dreams but this was my first time flying while astral projecting. I distinctly remember feeling like I could feel the cool night breeze against my skin, even though I wasn't in my real body, and I flew up to this big white house and looked through the second floor window at someone sitting on their bed looking at their phone. The next morning I walking to 711 for a cup of coffee like I always do and then on the way home I thought of the flying experience and decided to walk past my house and look around for the house flew to just to confirm that it was real. I saw the house like three blocks down the street and just smiled looking up at it. 

I've had a ton of other experiences with astraling and talking about it right now makes me want to do it again tonight. Something I've noticed is that there seems to be limitations on astraling, maybe its something to do with my subconscious or maybe its a spiritual law or something, but like when I astraled into my roommates room I could look at her TV but I couldn't turn around and look at her or anything. Another time I had a roommate that was very private and never allowed anyone to come into his room and I was very curious about how he decorated his room so one day I astraled into there but I couldn't look around the room, I could only look at the other side of the door which had a poster with words written on it and when he moved out I went to look in his room and he had taken all his belongings except for the poster which was still taped the door. 

Anyway, so those are just some of my astraling experiences, I'm going to set the intention to astral again tonight.   ",1,1770097782.0,AstralProjection,0,1.0,False

1qujreu,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1qujreu/my_vape_a_novel_sorry/,"My Vape (A Novel, Sorry!)","Hello everyone! Long-time Reddit lurker, first time poster. I am **Day 2** of no-vaping today and I wanted to share about my experience. 

I am a 30, almost 31 year old adult and smoked pretty heavily as a kid (1 pack a day) from about 15 years old - roughly 24/25 years old, with a few attempted breaks over my early 20’s. I then weaned myself off cigarettes with vaping, and we all know how that goes! I vaped heavily for around 3 years. After a few attempts to quit, I finally managed to quit for about 2 years (yay) and after an extremely stressful and traumatic experience, I picked the vape up again and have been addicted again since (it‘s been 18 months). Suffice to say - I have a long history with smoking/vaping and addiction. 

My vaping habits (disposable vape- the kind you just replace a pod every few days. I religiously smoked the Blueberry Raspberry 13,000 puffs - 28.5mg): 

* I vaped from the moment I woke up, to the moment I fell asleep. My sleep quality decreased dramatically, as did the amount of sleep I was getting. I would be awake until 5 am/sunrise most nights, and I’ve come to realise that was because **I just couldn’t bare to put the vape down. Not even to sleep.**  I was exhausted all the time because all I wanted to do was vape. 
* I was extremely angry, constantly. Almost like I wanted to give myself a reason to get riled up, annoyed, stressed over even the most minute thing - just to give myself justification to vape. I was always incredibly pissed off if I had to do anything or go anywhere where I couldn’t vape. 
* Which resulted in total impatience, and panic at times, if I couldn’t hold my vape or have some. I became anti-social because sitting in a restaurant to eat food or in a coffee shop to catch up, became unbearable. I would start looking at things through a lens of “that means being without my vape for 1 hour, or 20 minutes, etc” and I felt constantly “itchy” in the sense that if I had to put my vape down or away, my fingers would almost twitch and I would be desperate to get it out again. All I could think about was my vape - I was in a constant state of distraction and couldn’t even think clearly enough to contribute meaningfully any more.
* I never felt hungry, ever. Logically, I knew I had to eat, so I would once or twice a day. But the only thing I got excited about/looked forward to when it came to eating something, was the joy of being able to vape after eating (and for some reason, it just hit that much better?) Either way, I became iron-deficient and needed medical intervention because I wasn’t adequately feeding myself. (I’m fine now - yay, but it was a big wake up call…)
* The same went with having a coffee, driving, completing a task as minute as picking up some rubbish - all my chores took so much longer as well because I would have to vape every few minutes. And every normal little thing I did resulted in a little “reward” aka vaping. Oh, I made a cup of tea? Vape. I read an email? Vape. I put clothes on? Vape. It stopped being an “only stressed” thing and became a “even when I’m happy, or bored, or any other emotion”. **My vape made me feel in control of my life** (“I’m going to vape, THEN reply to that scary text. I’m going to vape, THEN go do the grocery shop), **but really, it took away all my control** because I couldn’t function without it and with it, the only function I could do was severely limited. 
* I was out of breath just moving around. I’m not overweight by any means, but I was embarrassingly puffy after climbing 10 sets of stairs or bending over. I stopped wanting to move around so much because it was uncomfortable being out of breath. If I could, my perfect day was just sitting in bed vaping from eyes open to eyes shut. I gained weight despite not eating because I just wasn‘t *moving*. It was a vicious cycle.
* My anxiety was bad. I was anxious not vaping, and then anxious vaping. There was no reprieve at all. I have a mild tremor in my fingers in general, but when I would vape my hands would shake to the point it felt like all the nerves in my hands and fingers were wild and out of control. They felt weak and I struggled to grasp things sometimes. And they were so obviously shaking that I felt embarrassed if people saw them, so I would start to hide them in pockets and wait till people looked away to reach and grab things. 
* Other physical symptoms from vaping: I struggled to breathe properly and would often have a numb arm and numb face because I was shallow breathing (unable to breathe deeply I am sure, because of my vape), chest pain (I also found myself at the ER once because the pain was so incredible, that I thought I must be having a heart attack. Had all the tests done and my heart was perfect), anxiety and panic attacks, extreme fatigue, very dull and sunken in looking skin and spots when I am not normally spotty - the rest of my body was very dry as well. I just looked and felt unhealthy in general. 

Overall - my vape took control of my entire life. It dictated my social life, my sleep, my moods, my decisions, my health, my eating habits - everything. I’ve never felt less human than I did vaping. It was worse than smoking. At least with smoking, it was something you intentionally had to step outside to do and you couldn’t just have one puff, you had to smoke the whole thing. Vaping being in a nifty, stench-free little contraption meant it could be hit at ANY moment, all day, once or a hundred times over. Anyway, I decided to quit cold-turkey two days ago because I desperately want my “life” back. I was so sick of being a dog on a chain. 

My withdrawal symptoms so far: 

* Extreme anger. Rage. Pure, lethal rage. So angry I couldn’t even speak to anyone yesterday without wanting to explode. Today is a bit better already. 
* I felt fine physically yesterday but woke up today with flu-like symptoms. A pounding headache, exhaustion, hot and cold, and extremely sore throat. 
* Depression. Yesterday, I quite literally contemplated why I was here. If I couldn’t vape, I no longer had anything to enjoy in my life. I didn’t want to eat or drink or move because what was the point when I couldn’t reward myself with my vape (and those things were sOOOOoooo much better with a vape afterwards)… said my brain. Today, I realise how unbelievably ridiculous that is. A hugely dramatic shift from one day to the next.
* My hands already on day 2 have stopped shaking. Quite noticeably.
* I haven’t felt out of breath. 
* I managed to sit in a cafe today and catch up with friends, without the “itchy” pressure of wanting to stand outside even in the pouring rain, just to be able to vape. I actually sat and felt normal. It felt like I had more ‘time’… I can’t quite explain that properly, but as if I wasn’t just impatiently waiting to finish my coffee, finish talking, finish eating, to be able to get outside and vape. I had this peace of “I have nothing else to do so I’ll sit here and be social and enjoy it.” I also didn’t have a moment of “ugh” doing chores today, I just did them. The “ugh” usually came from me not wanting to be away from my vape for even a moment, so I would put off my chores as long as I could. 
* I definitely wanted to go and buy a vape yesterday. I even tried negotiating with myself, eg “start March vape free instead, you’ll get more time and be more ready next month… just get a vape and carry it with you but don’t smoke it… reduce vaping to once a day… stand outside every time you want to vape and you’ll get annoyed and stop by yourself… you don’t have to quit cold turkey!” 
* Today, I miss my vape but I don’t miss vaping. I’ve had urges to pick something up, but I haven’t felt that overwhelming urge to go and purchase a vape. If somebody offered me one, I wouldn’t use it. I don’t want to face the shame and disappointment I would have towards myself, and I don’t want to make ALL of the above symptoms worthless/a waste of time just going back to vaping and having to experience them all over again when I inevitably quit. I keep telling myself that it’s a gross chemical-stick. 

SO… thank you for reading this far, if you have. If you haven’t, I totally understand. And if I haven’t “reddited” right, please don’t be mean, lol. So to everyone wondering what the conclusion to my rambling is: **Day 2, I miss my vape, I won’t be vaping again. I can do this. And YOU can do this. Don’t trust the part of your brain that says “one more vape then I’m really done” or ”I need it to cope/feel in control”… because reality is, you’re not coping properly with a vape and its controlling you, not the other way around.**",2,1770097545.0,QuitVaping,2,1.0,False

1qujkqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1qujkqo/marriage_prenup/,Marriage prenup,"I got engaged recently. My family has big business in the area where I live. Just confined to that area nothing multinational really. My dad primarily runs it since my mom died. I started helping out 4 years ago. 

My fiancé and me have been together for 8 years. It’s a long time I know but the pandemic happened and I tried doing graduate studies for a bit. 

My fiancés family is a well known family in their area also. His mom’s a lawyer. Contributing a lot to non profits etc. problem is they recently sold off their business due to the pandemic. 

My dad can be a bit of a narcissist but brilliant in his own right. He named all properties under me and my sibling for whatever reason. Problem is he really wants a prenup and I don’t mind it because these properties aren’t really mine to begin with. He’s going as far as to enumerate every property under my name in the prenup to “protect me”

One day me and my dad were having a pleasant  conversation over coffee. And i very nicely brought up how I didn’t like how the prenup really emphasizes how much we had and I felt it was a weird power move. I also mentioned my finances mom is a lawyer and she’ll probably have her own insights about it. 

He goes ballistic threatens to remove everything. I get mad because it got pretty condescending against my finances family. I explicitly told him that my finance nor his family cares about his vast properties. 

The thing is he’s done this before. My aunt got married and her husband didn’t want a prenup. He took off her name under the corporation everything. 

We’re now in this weird situation where we work at the company and don’t talk. I’m frankly very disgusted at his behavior and I wish my finance would be treated with more respect. It doesn’t bode well for our marriage also if it starts off like this. 

I just want general advice. I’ve also been considering just leaving as I cannot take the narcissism anymore. I won’t detail it since this is a marriage advice sub. I don’t really care for these properties because I’m tired of the dynamic personally. But would love some advice either way.

1qujhkx,https://i.redd.it/4k73evdyt7hg1.png,My engagement tomorrow depends entirely on her presence,"""Tell Eleanor, my engagement tomorrow depends entirely on her presence.""

It was an ultimatum. A concession, in Adam's mind.

A few minutes later, the assistant stammered.""Sir, She said... to go to hell.""

Chapter

Eleanor's POV

Three hours ago, Adam Hayes called.

It was the first time he'd reached out in three months.

His voice was as cool and detached as ever, brief and to the point ""Eleanor, come to my villa. I need to talk to you.""

Then the line went dead.

No room for questions. Just an order, like calling a dog he owned.

I admit, for a split second, that stagnant pool in my heart, long since silent, rippled with a pathetic hint of hope.

After all, I'd been that pet for seven years.

I even stood in front of the mirror, carefully covering the shadows under my eyes with my most expensive concealer. I spritzed on the woody scent he liked and slipped into the white dress he'd once said looked nice on me.

Seven years of feeling, of bending and yielding, had carved this sad reflex into me. He crooked a finger, and I'd run to him like a trained thing, eager for approval.

Even though I knew another carefully orchestrated humiliation probably awaited me.

The car smoothly pulled up to Adam's villa. Mr. Henderson, the butler, saw me and a complicated look flashed in his eyes. He seemed about to speak, then stopped.

My heart sank, but I managed a small smile and nodded at him, walking straight inside.

In the foyer, a pair of unfamiliar pink high heels lay crookedly on the floor, scattered next to a man's suit jacket and tie.

I stopped. No tears, no outbursts. My expression didn't even flicker.

I just quietly changed into slippers and walked up the stairs, one step at a time.

Every corner of this villa was painfully familiar to me. I could walk to his study with my eyes closed.

The study door was ajar. From inside came muffled, intimate sounds and a girl's petulant whine.

""Adam, stop...you're crushing my dress...""

I pushed the door open.

Inside, Adam held a young woman against him. Her face was buried in his chest, only the pale curve of her neck visible.

Three buttons of his shirt were undone, his usually immaculate hair was messy, and a smile I'd never seen before, tinged with desire and indulgence, played on his lips.

He glanced up at the sound. When his eyes met mine, that smile died, replaced by a flash of impatience and distaste.

""Eleanor, don't you know how to knock?""

The girl in his arms startled like a deer, lifting her head timidly.

A face of pure innocence, with wide, round eyes now brimming with tears, stared pathetically up at me.

I recognized her-Selena Blake, a film academy sophomore who'd recently gotten some attention from a web drama.

My own social media still had traces of posts I'd written defending her from trolls.

had called her a ""promising talent"" and asked me to take care of her.""

So this was how he took care of her.

""Adam, who is this?"" She whispered, her voice sweet and cotton-soft, perfectly timid.

Adam didn't answer her. He slowly straightened his collar, then turned his gaze back to me.

""Now that you've seen, I won't bother hiding it.."" He pulled a velvet box from the desk drawer and tossed it onto the coffee table between us.

""This, it's yours.""

I looked down. Inside the box lay a pair of diamond rings, the ones Adam's grandmother had given us when we got engaged.

Adam's indifferent voice sounded above me. ""I want to marry Selena. So, let's call off our engagement.""

No hint of guilt, no trace of hesitation.

I didn't look at the rings. My gaze fell on my left wrist.

It was a silver bracelet, the one Adam had given me for my eighteenth birthday.

He'd said I should wear it forever, just as he'd be with me forever.

For seven years, I had never taken it off.

It had long become a part of me, more familiar than my own skin.

I raised my eyes, calmly meeting his gaze. ""Understood.""

My calm seemed to throw him. Then he said mockingly. ""What, no performance this time? I expected tears. Screaming. The usual threats. Eleanor, that act is getting stale.""

I didn't answer. Instead, I lifted my left hand and began working the bracelet loose.

I'd worn it for so long the clasp had stiffened. It caught against my knuckle, grinding the skin red and raw.

The harder I tugged, the more it seemed to cling.

Selena covered her mouth in a show of concern. ""Eleanor, please don't. Adam didn't mean it like that. You'll only upset him if you hurt yourself.""

Her words sounded like an act, and a challenge.

Adam crossed the room and seized my wrist.

""Eleanor, what's the game now? Trying to play hard to get?""

I gasped, wincing in pain, but then I laughed.

""Adam,"" I said. ""You ended the engagement. This bracelet is yours. Why wouldn't I give it back?""

He stared intently at me, as if trying to find even the slightest trace of pretense on my face.

But he failed.

On my face, there was nothing but the tears brought on by the pain.

It seemed a broken heart really made no sound.

He finally released my hand, his gaze unreadable.

With all my strength, enduring the sharp pain, I finally tugged the slender silver bracelet off my wrist. A raw, red mark was seared onto my skin, a stark sight.

I gently placed the bracelet on the coffee table, next to the diamond rings.

""Adam, I wish you and Selena a happy marriage.""

Then I turned and walked out of the study. I didn't look back.

Driving away from the villa, I finally couldn't hold back anymore. My tears poured down, a torrent.

Seven years. It turned out to be as short as a single slap.

My boyfriend’s best friend (male) moved to our state about a month ago. They’ve known each other since childhood, so I understand they’re close, like brothers. But since he moved here, my boyfriend has been spending so much time with him that I’ve felt neglected.

I brought this up, and things improved briefly. He eventually introduced me to the friend (who’s also dating someone), and we went on a double date. The friend seems nice and nothing obvious felt suspicious. Still, my boyfriend spends a lot of time with him,sometimes 4–6 hours straight at his apartment playing games. On workdays, they’ll go to the gym or get coffee together, and my boyfriend even goes to his apartment during work breaks.

Yesterday really bothered me. I worked from 8–5, while my boyfriend went to his friend’s place around 11–12 and stayed until 5, when I picked him up. He had a gig from 6–8 pm, then suggested we go back to the friend’s place to cook and hang out. I wasn’t up for it since I hadn’t eaten all day and needed to be up at 5 am for school. I later found out he’d already told his friend we’d hang out again without checking with me first.

After his gig, we got takeout and ate at home. Immediately after, he said he felt bad because his friend was alone and that he’d promised to go back. I told him how that made me feel and that he’d already spent all day there. He still went, saying he didn’t want his friend to feel a way and that he’d told him he’d come back. It felt like his friend’s feelings mattered more than mine.

So tonight as I’m writing this, guess where he’s at during his break at work? Yep!! with the same friend again, helping look for a lost apartment key that he apparently lost. I didn’t get to spend any time with him at all. It’s just me and our cat, and I’m starting to get used to his absence.

TL;DR: My boyfriend spends a lot of time with his best friend (sometimes 4–6 hours, even during work breaks), and it’s making me feel neglected. I don’t know if this is normal or how to address it without sounding unreasonable.",4,1770096583.0,relationship_advice,15,1.0,False

1quj9fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1quj9fq/the_files/,The Files,"My fictional story is this:

rewrite in style of bukowski and  Hunter s Thompson

The newsroom was a busted aquarium full of old coffee and flickering screens, and I was the last fish stupid enough to keep swimming.

It was past midnight. The janitor was pushing that mop down the hallway like it owed him money, leaving snail‑trails of gray water. Somewhere a copy of the Constitution was crying into its beer. The big bosses were gone, the interns had vanished back to their cheap apartments and cheaper weed, and it was just me and the federal document dump from hell.

Three million pages of Epstein and every bastard who orbited him. Three million pages of bureaucratic moaning, legalese, and the occasional scream that slipped through the redactions. And threaded through it all, like a bad joke written in gasoline: TRUMP.

I stared at the portal. That ugly government interface, gray as an overcast hangover, waving a warning banner:

UNVERIFIED ALLEGATIONS. MAY BE FALSE. MAY BE FAKE. MAY BE YOUR NEW RELIGION.

I typed anyway.

TRUMP + ASSAULT + MINOR.

Hit Enter. Let the machine vomit its truth.

The counter spun up—fifty‑seven hits, ninety‑two, two hundred and change—and leveled out somewhere north of three hundred. Three hundred official government artifacts tying the President of the United States to the kind of words you used to only see in crime paperbacks and police reports.

Beautiful. Terrible. Exactly what I’d signed up for.

First doc: an FBI 302. I could spot one from across the bar at closing time. All those little boxes at the top like a DMV form for the damned. Case number, date, field office. Then the narrative, written in that dead federal voice that could make a bank robbery sound like a zoning dispute.

On [REDACTED], “Jane Doe” was interviewed…

Here she was again. Thirteen. Manhattan. Epstein. Trump. A townhouse that smelled like money and menace. I’d seen this story stagger through civil suits in 2016, limping from affidavit to affidavit, then collapsing in withdrawal. Now it was pinned here like a butterfly, flattening even as it tried to flutter.

“Victim stated she had previously sworn an affidavit…”  
“Victim acknowledged she later directed counsel to withdraw…”  
“Victim expressed fear that political implications would overshadow her story…”

You could hear the agents backing away even as they wrote it, hands held up, neat little note‑takers at the intersection of Hell and Campaign Season.

The internet would chew this up and spit out its favorite flavors: TRUMP. RAPE. EPSTEIN. Thirteen. That’s all it needed. That’s all it ever wanted.

But I could see the rest. The hesitation. The bureaucratic stutter around a story that might be the truth or might be a fever dream or might be something worse: something real and unprovable.

My phone buzzed. A text from Erin over at the other outlet—the one that pays better and cares less.

still w/ the epstein sewer?  

I wrote: it’s overflowing.  

She: drinks?  

I flipped the phone face‑down. Tonight I was married to the sewer.

Next document. A tip‑line log. Some digital lunatic squealing into the government void. An email address that looked like a bad joke and a worse security decision, claiming to know a girl, a party, New Jersey, the president, an act so vile it left teeth marks.

The agent’s note at the bottom was pure comedy:

Lead opened. WFO to contact complainant.

And then the abyss. No follow‑up. No closure. No neat TV‑season ending. Just another little coffin nailed shut with the words “no further info.”

This is what you don’t get in the movies. In the movies, the tips line up, the witnesses crack, and the bad man goes to jail or dies righteously in a hail of government‑issue bullets. In real life, the story drowns in voicemail.

I opened a fresh doc. It blinked at me, innocent and empty.

WORKING HEADLINE:  
INSIDE THE EPSTEIN FILES: THE TRUMP ACCUSATIONS AND THE GAPING HOLE WHERE CERTAINTY SHOULD BE

Too long. Too honest. I hacked at it until it looked like something a respectable paper could print without spontaneously combusting.

The first thing you need to know about the Trump allegations in the Epstein files is that they’re not new…

I stopped. It felt like trying to explain a dirty joke to a jury.

“Still here?” a voice said.

It was Richard, the night copy guy, floating in the doorway with his sleeves rolled and his eyes half‑shot. A ghost of deadlines past.

“Apparently,” I said.

He looked at the screen. “Jesus. You bathing in that stuff now?”

“Cheaper than mezcal.”

“Say the magic word.”

“Unverified,” I said.

He smiled. “Again.”

“Unverified.”

“That’s the one. Tuck it in everywhere. Lidocaine for the lawyers.”

He wandered off, leaving the smell of red pen and printer toner in his wake.

I went back to the file dump and pulled up a Department statement—some poor bastard’s attempt to get ahead of the mob.

Some materials may include fabricated images and videos, as well as false or sensational allegations…

Translation: “Congress made us dump the trash, don’t blame us if some of it is radioactive.”

I wanted to print that line on a T‑shirt and wear it to every press conference for the rest of my life.

Back in my draft, I carved ribs into the beast:

– Jane Doe, the ghost of 2016.  
– The FBI memo that embalms her.  
– The New Jersey story with the teeth and the fist.  
– The pile of drunk‑dial tips and weaponized rumors.  
– DOJ waving a little flag that says “some of this is crap, we promise.”  
– The dog that didn’t bark: no charges, no memos, no smoking gun.

Outside, the city’s lights smeared themselves against the windows like someone had thumbed the whole skyline. A siren wound up and unwound, bored and hungry.

I wrote:

The presence of these stories in federal files doesn’t make them true. It makes them official. It means somebody told them, somebody wrote them down, and now they live here forever, knocking around inside the machinery of the state. What the files don’t show is the hard part: proof. There are no visible prosecution memos recommending charges against Trump for sex crimes tied to Epstein, no indictments, no sign in what’s been released that the Justice Department thought it had a case it could win.

I stared at that last part. It felt like standing in front of a firing squad and asking for a second cigarette.

That absence matters just as much as the allegations.

There it was. The line. The tightrope. The goddamn razor blade.

I took another dive into the archive and surfaced with a gem: an internal evaluation memo, some desk jockey’s attempt to put the wild online rumors into a neat gray box.

Analyst reviewed open‑source claims… Many appear derivative of initial Jane Doe civil complaint… No independent corroboration found… Recommended no further action absent new evidence.

No further action. The music of the spheres in American justice. Not guilty, not innocent. Just… not tonight.

I could feel the story forming into something sharp and mean in my hands. Not the fantasy the partisans wanted, not the exoneration or the miracle indictment. Just a mirror held up to the system itself: the girls, the gossip, the way the whole apparatus took in screams and spat out PDFs.

By now my eyes felt like someone had sanded them. My spine had fused into the cheap newsroom chair. The clock said 12:37 a.m., which is the hour when you find out what kind of reporter you really are.

I kept going.

I laid out the New Jersey allegation like an autopsy: who said what, who they claimed was there, what they described. No adjectives. No purple prose. Just verbs that told the truth about where I stood: “claimed,” “alleged,” “said.”

You have a right to know that people told these stories to federal agents. You also have a right to know that, based on what’s visible now, those stories never turned into charges—and that the same Justice Department dumping these files is waving a neon sign that some of this stuff is false.

I could already hear the howling—every flavor of it. The true believers who would say I was carrying water for a monster. The loyalists who would call it a witch hunt. The bored, broken souls who’d shrug and ask if there was any video.

Richard reappeared with my printout marked up in bloody ink.

“You threaded the needle,” he said.

“Feels more like floss between shark teeth.”

He jabbed a red pen at one paragraph. “Here. You’re apologizing for saying what’s on the page. Cut the apology. Leave the facts.”

I did. The sentence stood up straighter without its cringing qualifiers. Naked, ugly, honest.

“Go home,” he said. “Let the internet scream at you in the morning.”

I saved the file—like a prayer, like a superstition, like flushing the toilet in a haunted house—and sent it to the system that would queue it up for public consumption. A twelve‑hundred‑word offering to the gods of outrage.

At the window, the city looked drunk and tired. Somewhere down there were men who’d flown on private jets with Epstein and smiled for cameras with Trump and called themselves businessmen or princes or philanthropists, like those words could sand the blood off their boots.

I knew what the story was now.

The Trump stuff in the Epstein dump wasn’t a secret dossier waiting to explode. It was a funhouse mirror. It showed you what people were willing to say, what the feds were willing to write down, and how far the machine would go before it shrugged and said, “No further action.”

That’s the part no one wants—no closure, no verdict, just a stack of paper and the knowledge that the truth is somewhere inside, half‑rotted and fused to the lies.

My phone buzzed again.

u alive? Erin wrote.

barely. filed.  

She: good. someone has to be the adult in the room.

I laughed, a short, cracked sound. I didn’t feel like an adult. I felt like a court reporter at the trial of the century, except no one ever called a jury.

On my way out, I caught my reflection in the elevator doors: unshaven, raccoon‑eyed, ink‑stained. A man who’d spent the night swimming through filth and come out with nothing but words.

“Unverified,” I muttered.

Not the allegations. Not tonight.

The courage to put them on the page with all their missing pieces, and to say out loud: this is all we’ve got, and it might not be enough.

The elevator shuddered, coughed, and started down.

i felt like in all areas of my life i was “successfully manifesting” except my sp so i’d tell myself that “oh well i only want them as my friends w benefits” or “we’re together w/o the label” but truthfully i really did like this person and wanted a relationship. i eventually realized that i wasn’t “successfully” manifesting in all areas except this one, they were just ***coincidences***. i didn’t randomly get money because of my “self concept” in money or because i affirmed 10k times that i’m rich, i got money because i got a scholarship to pay for school due to my grades. i didn’t get an internship because i affirmed or was “in the state of someone who had the internship” i got it because of my hard work. and i’d tell myself “well manifesting is natural so ofc this was the bridge of incidents” lol everything is a bunch of hoopla. i was “successful” because sometimes some things just workout, by chance, by coincidence, or by your own hard work! i never caused it with my thoughts, my assumptions, or my state.

i was terrified to let it go, i thought things would get worse. i thought i’d manifest even worse things for myself but i was so mentally exhausted and so over the people who would talk about these “fake” success stories. after a month, i realized my life didn’t collapse.

**YOU ARE NOT BROKEN; IT GETS BETTER**

in my experience, you will still be repeating affirmations on a loop without thinking, you will overthink if your thoughts will manifest, you will still think about the law & how this horrible scenario might “manifest”. i’m here to tell you that it won’t last long, the only way out is through. the law isn’t real, manifestation isn’t real and that’s incredibly freeing. you are not tied to your thoughts, you literally can live your life without fear (this sounds very loa mumbo jumbo but listen) nothing is out to get you, no thoughts, no state, no nothing. life is what you make it (so make it rock!)

***this is what has happened ever since i left the law in early 2023***

***-*** *the overthinking/anxiety has stopped, i don’t know what it’s like to affirm on a loop without thinking*

*- i no longer get anxiety attacks about my thoughts or the “state” i am in*

*- i made new friends*

*- i took photography as a hobby, graphic design, and knitting*

*- my mental healthy got significantly better*

*- my relationship with other also got better because i finally stopped lying (to convince myself that i had something i hadn’t manifested yet) and i also stopped avoiding ppl since in my thought i needed to “ignore the 3d” and if i interacted with people, i wouldn’t be able to “ignore my 3d”*

*- i have taken trips, i have tried amazing (and a concerning amount) of coffee and food*

*- i have overthought, i have cried, i have literally believed something awful would happen, and every time i’ve been wrong (this won’t happen every time but it’s life and i survived and so will you)*

*- i got my life together, not the life i wished for that would manifest by affirming! i got up, i studied, i graduated, i got my degree, and i started working. was it easy, no? but that’s life. i didn’t manifest it, i worked for it.*

*- i got my bf (now before ppl think “it’s because you let go of resistance) actually, no. i just stopped obsessing over manifesting and actually lived my life. we became really good friends and things just happened. no SATS, no affirmations, no mantras, no sleep tapes, just normal human interaction. and if that wouldn’t have happened, i would still be living my life because sometimes things do or don’t work out!*

**LASTLY,**

if you’re still struggling with the law, let it go. delete your loa accounts, this subreddit is pretty awesome to get you to stop thinking that crap is real. get back to your hobbies, if you have none, start one! life is so much more than trying to force yourself to “manifest”. it’s so much more than to sit in your room repeating affirmations, looping a scene, monitoring your state, than to actually be living the life you want to! be kinder to yourself. you don’t need to “control reality” to be safe. you don’t need perfect thoughts, or affirmations, or to change your state. you’re allowed to exist, try, fail, learn, try again, succeed. that’s what life is about, that’s what humans are meant to do.

**TL;DR**

leaving the law didn’t ruin my life. it gave it back to me.

1quj32f,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1quj32f/how_much_should_a_server_make_per_hour/,How much should a server make per hour?,"What's your answer to that question?

If you're a non-tipper, unless your answer is the same as your state's minimum wage for tipped jobs (e.g., $2.13 per hour in 18 states), you're not being principal-driven.  You're just getting over on low wage earners, and pretending it's virtue.

But let's say you honestly think food servers and bartenders should make somewhat more than minimum wage.  Say $21 per hour.   And you live in one of those 18 states where minimum wage for tipped jobs is $2,13.  Most servers can handle three tables at once.  So you should tip a third of the difference between (a) tipped minimum wage age and (b) $21 an hour, times (c) the number of hours you spend at the table.  

So if it takes your party 90 minutes to eat, and you live in one of the 18 states where TMW is $2.13, then you should tip (a) $21 - (b) $2.13 -- so, $18.87 -- times 1.5 ($28.30) divided by 3.  That's $9.43 for the table.  And that's whether your total bill was $20 (for 3 coffees and a dessert to share three ways) or $250 for a fancy dinner.  

Any other approach that leads to lower tips than that is a little too convenient.  It's just justification for free riding because you can get away with it.  I call bullshit.  

A tip is not a ""donation."" Both the customer and the server know the expectations, and each should act accordingly.  It's basic social,  and non sociopathic, behavior.

EDIT:  I posted this knowing it would be an unpopular opinion.  So I'm going to stop arguing.  Peace.

1quj2jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1quj2jw/day_10_varencline_chantex/,Day 10 Varencline (Chantex),"Thought I’d come here contribute as I was once scanning experiences with generic Chantix (Varencline) prior to starting my journey. Some context here - I’m 29 now and started smoking in high school then moved over to vaping for the past decade. Essentially my adult brain doesn’t know what it is without nicotine… genuinely didn’t think the day of quitting would come until the doctor did the heavy metals test and noticed some aluminum levels that were concerning. That’s when it was time. 

It’s strange that this drug really isn’t promoted in the US despite how effective it can be .. 

Within 10 days I went from sleeping with my vape under my pillow to not even knowing where I last left it while typing this in bed.. When I tell you I just sat through an entire movie and didn’t reach for it once! This is the medication working. I was skeptical but wow. At this point, it seems more of me reaching for it when a thought hits “ like oh I forgot to do this thing I always used to do after I eat or while I drink coffee” rather than needing it. 

As for side effects really it’s mainly been fatigue for like the first two days then nausea for a short window after taking the medication. I’m someone who already has very vivid dreams and expected hellish nightmares but it’s mainly been insomnia. I come here to tell you all who come across this wondering if you try it, this is your sign. Just seems whenever this medication is mentioned. It’s always paired with a horror story. I’m here to tell you that it hasn’t been the case for me.. 

My first step in this journey was listening to Allen Carr’s book just to warm myself up and face all the rationalizations I’d built over the years. Then I started substituting the vape with a minty mouth sensory toy I got on Amazon - mentally telling myself it’s gonna be this at some point with no vape to follow it. Finally, I started the medication.

I’m on day 10 now, and I’m genuinely shocked at how my brain is no longer searching for it in the way it used to. I’m still working on adjusting to this new routine of life to rewire. All I know is the nicotine industry is a vicious monster and told myself I would not be participating in any NRT. But it makes one wonder why is this medication not promoted in the US when it’s highly effective in smoking cessation. I did some research and apparently FDA put a strong box warning on the original Chantex that was developed by Pfizer because of concerning levels of some chemical. But the generic version- Varencline has had no issues. And horror stories of severe side effects came out. Meanwhile, research concludes minimal correlation to mental health episodes with Varencline. Anyhow - will post more updates as they come ",1,1770095323.0,QuitVaping,3,1.0,False

1quj1vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1quj1vk/japan_trip_march_2026/,Japan Trip March 2026,"Hello everyone! My partner and I just started planning a trip to Japan for March, 2026 with my partner. A dream trip we are both grateful to be able to take. (a whole month off!) For some context, we enjoy big cities (NYC, Paris, Toronto (home), but also love nature and hikes/trails. (absolutely loved our recent trip to Banff). We are expecting to do a lot of shopping and visiting a lot of coffee shops.

Both of us are easy going and we are trying not to do things just to check it off the list. There are days we are planning to slow down and just spend hours enjoying coffee and people watching and having conversations. (love seeing cool outfits, culture, atmosphere) For shopping, we want to visit shops for: clothing, jewelry, TCG shops, ceramics, quality kitchen knives, specialty matcha, maybe some gunpla. 

As we are finalizing specific days (booking things), we just have a couple of questions:

1. Is the second half of this trip too crazy? (due to the amount of traveling within 1-2weeks) 

2. Is luggage forwarding as simple as it seems? Anything I should be aware of? 

3. We are looking for specific recommendations (boutiques, coffee shops, etc.) that fit our interests that I can throw into the itinerary/map.

3.5. Anything we don't have that is a must do for our first time that is worth the hype?

4. Are there any cool hikes (medium intensity) within the areas we will be in?

1. People aren’t that scary and chances are they are as nervous as you are and are also eager to make friends, so just take the first step in introducing yourself.

2. Not everyone you talk too will click with you and that’s fine. There’s thousands of new enrolling students and a ton more students who are already enrolled that are still looking for/ wanting more friends (me :) )

3. Like everyone says, clubs are a really good place to make friends, and for me volunteering at uni helped me find most of my friends right now and sports as well! 

4. Classes and group work helps u find friends that are taking a similar path to you and make class more enjoyable especially when you have questions that you need help with during workshops and all that. I also met a lot of friends through group work (been blessed with amazing group mates) 

Anyways all in all just participate in the events during welcome week because you can meet so many new students and I heard so many people who are still friends with those they met during welcome week. Some good ones are the free bubble tea, boardgames, coffee catch up, and more! Check Unihub ultimately. Oh and clubs might make events to make friends as well which are amazing.

1quj06i,https://www.reddit.com/r/IT_Talk/comments/1quj06i/is_consulting_dead_why_mckinsey_bcg_are_losing_to/,Is Consulting Dead? Why McKinsey & BCG Are Losing to AI.,"You know what's wild? We've been looking at the consulting game lately, and most of these firms are running on business models that feel straight out of a 2005 PowerPoint deck. It's like a mechanic with a broken-down tow truck offering to fix your Tesla. The irony is so thick you could cut it with a slide deck pointer.

We couldn't help but see this through our product-manager lens – you know, the professional deformation. Here’s our unfiltered take.

The whole business consulting industry is pulling a massive **pivot**. It's shifting from ""We'll *tell* you what to do"" to ""We'll *roll up our sleeves and walk you there*, step-by-step."" And here’s why:

1. **Strategy is now a commodity.** Companies are drowning in ideas. AI has turned hypothesis generation into a free feature. It can crank out a SWOT, PEST, or BCG matrix before your overpriced coffee gets cold. It connects cause and effect. Today, a single sharp founder can architect a solid—sometimes brilliant—strategy. Paying six figures for a deck full of obvious insights? That game is over.
2. **The knowledge monopoly is dead.** Old-school consultants were gatekeepers of exclusive data and frameworks. Now, AI access has democratized that expertise. You can't make bank just repackaging public knowledge anymore. The moat is gone.
3. **Pragmatism is king.** Businesses want outcomes, not invoices. The billable hour is becoming a major red flag. Paying for ""process"" feels like paying for air. Clients want tangible ROI, not a timesheet.
4. **They're getting checked at the door.** When a company shops for a consultant now, they do a background check on the *consultant's own business model*. If it looks archaic, trust evaporates before the first ""synergy"" is mentioned in the presales call. It’s an instant credibility killer.
5. **The talent pool is... questionable.** Let’s be real. Through the Lensa AI filter, a lot of consulting rosters look like they’re filled with burnt-out corporate pilots who jumped ship for a ""quiet harbor."" The actual gurus? They’re unicorns, affordable only to the top 0.1%.

**Consulting won't die. It will evolve.** It will have to focus on problems that live **outside AI's capabilities**. Consultants will need to ditch the ""advisor"" badge and become **full-stack architects of change**.

This is where the rubber meets the road—and where most will wipe out. Being a change architect isn't a workshop; it's embedding with a client for 1-2 years and **showing measurable performance gains every quarter**. No hiding behind fancy presentations.

The new consultant MVP (Minimum Viable Profile) needs:

* **Real leadership chops** (not just facilitation skills)
* **Hardcore management skills** (execution, not just ideation)
* **A high risk tolerance**
* **A mindset for the long game**

Forget whiteboard markers and perfect slides. Think boots on the ground and skin in the game.

So, what percentage of current ""business consultants"" can actually **lead, inspire, and ship results**? Let's not kid ourselves—it's a small slice.

What this points to is the future: companies **hiring these change architects in-house for the transformation sprint** (call it a 2-year tour of duty). The traditional consulting firm model—with its bloated hierarchies, trophy offices, armies of juniors, and insane overhead—starts to look like legacy code that needs a complete refactor.

You can see the cracks forming at the big names: McKinsey, BCG, Bain, the Big Four... not to mention the local players. The playbook is breaking.

But here’s the kicker: **for truly smart companies, this is the perfect storm.** It's prime time to skip the middleman, build internal capability, and own your transformation. The old guard is vulnerable. The opportunity to outmaneuver them has never been bigger.

The market isn't just shifting; it's doing a hard reboot. The question is, who's ready to write the new OS?",1,1770095116.0,IT_Talk,0,1.0,False

Memory transcript Subject: Mutya Reyes, Human Refugee. Male 

""Can't believe i got chosen to come to this place. Venlil prime, where I get to be torched alive for the sin of being alive. I would much rather be home and die there than here. At least I probably won't feel myself getting blown up."" I murmur to myself as I stepped outiof the transport and into the area of the refugee center. Murmuring keeps the bad vibes of dying away. Though I really would have rather played on the second hand piano we had at home as wemget engulfed by the blast. I wasn't the best at piano, but I knew how to do it. It was something relatively fun, when not forced that is. 

I didn't really remember much of the environment because I was too busy with my stuff. I brought as much as I could in terms of being able to do it alone. Which wasn't as much as others, but I rather do it on my own to let me take into account my everything. And I don't trust the system to be kind to the things that I originally wanted to bring as most of it was breakable. I carried the bare minimum clothes, supplies, a little furniture that I may need. Mama's jewelry, papa's jewelry, the few that lola passed to me, the electric keyboard I managed to just barely bring as it was small enough and light enough, and a few other essentials. I hated the fact I couldn't bring the upright piano we bought for dirt cheap at some second hand place. It was heavy,iit was loud, it was the best for me. I couldn't play in front of a crowd to save my life, nor could I play a piece without making a mistake to save my life. But it was fun playing at my own pace, and I didn't care. I was gonna miss that piano. Especiallywthe hard keys. 

I refused to interact with anyone, the bad thoughts were clawing at my brain, and I didn't like the sound of how everyone was so dour. ""Okay, me. breath in"" I took a deep breath in ""breath out"" I then let it out. ""Let's just... Let's just play something. Maybe.... Oh wait!"" I immediately began to rummage around the boxes I brought, pulling out one of my favorite easy pieces. ""Fuck yeah, I didn't leave it. Now I just gotta set up the piano, and I'll be good to go. I don't need to set my clothes up, boxes will do. I don't really need to set a whole lot up, and most of my furniture is still taking a while. At least I saved the nice stuff, gonna miss the pretty plates though.""I

I looked at the clock, it was almost technically night, though the sun was not helping. Perfect for a little night tune to calm down before sleeping. Setting the stand up wasn't a problem, this piano was the cheap one my lola bought at some random stall in a mall. It was light, cheap, and easy to transport. after a short time setting up, I pressed the keys and immediately remembered why I wanted to bring the expensive electric keyboard, even if it was way and bulkier. ""Oh, right. The keys don't feel nice."" One of the keys was broken, but still played. Holding on for dear life with hot glue and a dream. But mama didn't raise me to be picky.

""Okay.... Que Sera sera."" It was fitting in my ears. Whatever will be, will be. The future wasn't mine to see, so I just had to accept that. Accept it and make the best out of my situation. If I had the time, I would probably have went to the graveyard and broke a piece off of the lapida from each of my family's gravestones. Mama, papa, as many as I could and brought them here. ""Bad thoughts, go away. Whatever will be, will be."" I should probably roam the place tomorrow, walking always did help. But for now, the piano was doing just well.

An hour passed after playing the same song for 1 entire hour, and I feel great. The bad thoughts were going away, and the good thoughts were coming back. ""I really need to make friends, I can't keep talking to myself."" I mean, I can but Ireally just need to vibe with someone. My old friends and best friend are elsewhere of refugees. Too busy to contact, too tired to try and do it. ""Okay, first task is bathe, brush teeth, then sleep. Next is wake up, go out, walk, not get torched, and try to see the locals. I probably won't die. Whatever will be, will be.

After taking a bath that felt weird because the water was warm and I had no dipper or pail, I put on some old clothes I wear to sleep and crawled into my malong on rhe ground. Whoever delayed my furniture can go suck a lemon. The ground was hard, and it all just sucked in general. I didn't even bring much, and it still got delayed. ""Tomorrow will be better, hopefully."" I say to myself, rubbing the bracelets I wore on my left. Each one came from someone, my lola, mama, and papa. I never take them off. At least these will keep me sane until all this mess blows over. Surely earth will be fine, surely the fleet will be stopped or turned around. Surely my home country will at least survive, it's too small to actually be considered a major target.

""Can't believe I just graduated the nursing board, only to be unemployed for a fat while. At least my savings account is doing pretty well. Okay... Time to sleep. Think sleepy thoughts."" As I felt myself drift, I couldn't stop myself from thinking of other pieces to sleep to. Tomorrow is another day.

Went onto say how nice Americans were and it chipped up my mood a bit. I was already having a rough start to the day that day. 

Fast forward, I am making coffee and the customer comes over to me with this necklace. She goes onto explain it in detail and how it was just a nice gesture New Zealand’s did. And how it “wasnt a big deal, just a nice thing to do” I could’ve cried to the women in that moment. The necklace was a small gesture but it wasn’t small to me. I’ve worn this necklace almost everyday since getting it almost 3 months ago.

For me it reminds me to be in constant movement. I’ve enjoyed yoga and a little hip movement here and there but this necklace has transformed how I feel about the power of movement and ugh. I will forever cherish it. I’ve even started to consider getting a swirl tattoo on my heart/stomach so that I will always have the symbol with me.

Below I'll break down my lifestyle, habits, and goals real quick and structured so the advice hits hard and on point.

General Info  
I am an adult (22 years old, a guy), and as far as I know, I do not have any chronic diseases. Height 195.90 kilograms or 76.87 inches 198.4 pounds  
Don't drink alcohol.  
Don't smoke.  
No drugs or stimulants (except caffeine) for me.

**Lifestyle**  
Mostly sedentary AF: desk job on the computer.  
Work schedule's 2/2, roughly from 9 PM to 9 AM—yeah, 12-hour shifts (it's normal in Russia lol).

Eat about 2–3 times a day, normal food.  
Diet's balanced in general, no extremes.  
Issue is occasional hardcore cravings for sweet and salty stuff (chocolate, gummies, cookies, chips, sugary drinks), which I sometimes binge on heavy in a day.

**Planned Experiment**  
Goals:

* Cut down on sweet cravings,
* Ditch regular sugary product intake,
* Better control my eating,
* Save my wallet lmao.

Planning to use **sugar-free energy drinks only** as a sub for those ""dopamine sweets"" over **4–5 weeks**.

How I'm doing it:

* No more than **3–4 (sometimes up to 5) energy drinks a week**;
* Not on an empty stomach;
* One can per day, sipped slow over time;
* No evenings, no messing with sleep;
* Other days—tea or coffee in mod amounts.

Basically, the energy drink ain't replacing meals, just curbing that impulsive sweet tooth between eats.

**What I'm Curious About**  
Wanna know from y'all:

1. How acceptable is this kinda sugar-free energy drink routine for a healthy adult in the short term (1 month)?
2. What risks (heart/vascular, nervous system, gut) are most likely with this exact setup?
3. What symptoms should make me nope out and stop the experiment ASAP?

**Why I'm Posting**  
My goal ain't to justify a bad habit, but:

* Mindfully and safely test if this works for ditching excess sugar;
* Do it controlled;
* Base it on medical facts, not vibes or random internet BS.

Appreciate any pro opinions and recs big time.",0,1770094720.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

1quityf,https://i.redd.it/oi4lp2t2o7hg1.jpeg,When His Love Became a Weapon,"In Ravenport City, whenever people mentioned me, the so-called heir to an Old-Money dynasty, their faces twisted with open mockery.

“An Old-Money heiress, so what? She still took her husband’s name and married into the Cole family just to play nanny.”

“Exactly. She nearly bled to death giving birth, and her husband was off celebrating his mistress’s birthday.”

Because everyone believed I loved Ethan Cole too much to ever leave him.

Ethan believed it too.

So when I handed him the divorce papers, he signed without even glancing at them, his impatience barely concealed.

“Don’t bother me with nonsense. Lydia isn’t well. She needs someone with her.”

Seeing Ethan about to leave, my son ran over and tugged at the hem of his pants.

“Dad, today’s my birthday. Can you stay with me, just for today?”

Ethan frowned and shoved him aside without a second look, not even noticing the scrape on his arm.

“Why are you as unreasonable as your mother? Is a birthday more important than Lydia’s health?”

The servants watched in silence, pity mixed with quiet contempt.

“In Mr. Cole’s eyes, neither his wife nor his son mattered half as much as Miss Moore.”

After cleaning Noah’s wound, I tucked the divorce papers away and finally dialed that familiar number.

“Julian, I lost the bet. I’ll listen to you and come home. As for Cole Group, do whatever you want with it.”

\---

On the other end of the line, my brother let out a slow breath.

“Alright. Give me three days to fully sever ties with Cole Group. I’ll come get you myself after that.”

Just as I was about to hang up, guilt crept into his voice.

“Claire… I never should’ve made that bet with you.”

“I wanted to force you to leave Ethan back then, but I forgot how stubborn you are. You held on all this time.”

The word stubborn stunned me for a moment. No one had used it on me in years.

Lately, all I ever heard was that I was annoying, tedious, unbearable.

Yet it was precisely that stubbornness that left me with no regrets when I finally chose to walk away.

After hanging up, I had just coaxed Noah to sleep when Margaret Cole stormed in.

Several richly dressed women followed close behind her.

She shot me an irritated glance the moment she saw me. “I brought friends over for a game. Go make some tea and prepare snacks.”

I frowned instinctively. “Noah’s hurt. He just fell asleep. You’ll wake him.”

The women looked on with thinly veiled amusement, surprised I’d dared refuse.

Humiliated in front of them, Margaret flew into a rage and slapped me hard across the face. “How dare you talk back to your elder!”

I stumbled, crashing into the coffee table, my head striking the edge.

Dizziness hit instantly, warm liquid sliding down my forehead.

I forced myself to look up at her, my gaze icy.

It was the first time she’d ever seen that expression on my face.

A flicker of panic crossed her eyes, but she stiffened and pressed on. “I’m teaching you a lesson. That’s what happens when you disrespect family.”

Her friends sneered openly. “So the rumors were true. The Whitmore heiress really did become the Cole family’s servant.”

“Servant’s too kind. She threw herself at them and begged to marry in.”

I tried to stand and tear their mouths apart, but my vision blurred. Just as I collapsed again, someone rushed forward and caught me.

When I woke, my head was already bandaged.

Outside the room, Ethan’s voice thundered with anger. “Mom, if today ever happens again, the gambling debts you owe can be your own problem.”

“And your friends better watch their mouths. Losing a few contracts will be the least of their worries.”

My head throbbed. I reached for painkillers and the glass of alcohol beside the bed.

A hand appeared out of nowhere and knocked the glass aside. “Taking pills with alcohol? Are you trying to kill yourself?”

He exhaled in relief, then frowned at me in irritation.

Live? I laughed softly, bitter and hollow.

Who wouldn’t want to live?

Had he forgotten I’d already stood at death’s door once before?

When I gave birth to Noah, complications sent me into massive hemorrhaging.

The doctor needed a family member’s signature for an emergency C-section. That was when Ethan received Lydia’s call.

She claimed her depression was acting up and that she wanted to end her life.

He didn’t even stay long enough to sign before rushing out.

Julian arrived just in time to save me.

But during surgery, I hemorrhaged again, and the hospital issued a critical condition notice.

Julian called Ethan like a madman. At first the calls went through.

Then there was nothing but an automated voice. Ethan had turned his phone off.

Because that night, he was busy comforting Lydia and setting off a private fireworks show for her birthday.

Back then, I truly thought it might be easier to just die.

But when I was about to give up, Noah’s cry pulled me back.

I was terrified he’d grow up marked by my death, growing up with a mother who took her own life.

I survived that night by sheer luck. Meanwhile, Lydia’s social media feed overflowed with their sweetness.

When I didn’t respond, Ethan sighed and leaned down to kiss my forehead.

“Alright. I promise today won’t happen again.”

I turned my head to avoid him. His phone rang again.

It was Lydia.

He glanced at me and still answered. A voice, thick with hurt, came through.

“Ethan… it’s thundering outside. I’m scared. Can you come stay with me?”

Chapter 2

Almost instantly, he stood up, as if she were the one gravely injured.

Her sobbing continued through the phone.

“Am I bothering you again? I know I shouldn’t, but I’m really scared.”

“You promised you’d never leave me alone. Was that a lie?”

Watching his hand tighten around the phone, I smiled faintly.

Lydia had always been clever, always knew exactly which words would make him ache.

They met in college, their love loud and reckless.

The gentle campus beauty and the charming golden boy were supposed to be destined.

Just when everyone thought they were inseparable, the Cole Group fell into crisis, and Lydia chose to walk away.

That was when I approached Ethan. “Marry me. I’ll fix Cole Group’s problems.”

On our wedding day, as he slid the ring onto my finger, his smile looked sincere enough to fool the world.

“Claire, thank you for coming into my life. I’ll never let go of your hand.”

Later, at an alumni gala, a spotlight collapsed from above.

Without hesitation, he released my hand and turned to shield Lydia instead.

Glass tore into my skin as blood spilled, vivid and bright.

I was rushed into surgery for an entire night. My body was covered in wounds, yet I felt nothing.

The pain in my heart drowned everything else out.

Ethan tightened his grip on the phone. The moment our eyes met, I already knew his decision.

“Claire, Lydia’s health is fragile. I’m afraid this will trigger her.”

This time, I didn’t grab him or beg him to stay.

I turned away, closed my eyes, and spoke calmly. “Go. You’re free now. Go wherever you want.”

The air froze. For the first time, unease flickered in Ethan’s eyes.

Before he could speak, Lydia’s voice cut in again, trembling with tears.

“Claire, I never meant to take Ethan from you. You don’t need to play mind games with me.”

“Ethan, this is my fault. I shouldn’t have called.”

Any trace of doubt vanished, replaced by anger.

“Claire, I misjudged you. When did you become someone who schemes like this?”

The bedroom door flew open.

Noah rushed in crying, punching at him with tiny fists. “Dad, you’re bad! You hurt me and you hurt Mom!”

Ethan froze for a second, then snapped back into rage. “You’re just a kid, and you’re already hitting people, and lying about getting hurt?”

“Claire Whitmore, you grew up without a mother. Is that why you don’t know how to raise a child?”

His accusatory gaze made my chest tighten, and I could barely breathe.

When Noah first started at kindergarten, older kids bullied him. He hid it because he didn’t want us to worry.

Ethan noticed something was wrong before I did. He went to the school to demand answers.

They denied everything, cold and smug.

One parent sneered at me. “No mother of her own, no wonder she can’t teach her kid properly.”

That was the first time Ethan ever threw a punch. His eyes were murderous.

“If reason doesn’t work, don’t blame me for using force.”

“My wife taught my son well. He doesn’t lie or bully others, unlike you, who only know how to lash out.”

I stood outside then, grateful my son had a good father.

Now, with just a few soft words from Lydia, he denied both Noah and me.

He was no different from those parents after all.

Seeing me stare, Ethan finally realized what he’d said. Guilt flickered across his face.

“Claire, I didn’t mean it like that…”

Suddenly, Lydia screamed over the phone. “Ethan, I think someone’s in the house. Please come now!”

Whatever he meant to say died on his lips.

“I’m coming. Don’t be scared.”

He left too fast, like a wind I could never catch. The family portrait Noah had drawn fell to the floor.

Noah picked it up, eyes red, and buried himself in my arms.

“Mom, why doesn’t Dad like me anymore? He used to say I was the best kid in the world.”

His words pierced straight through my heart. I held him close and wiped his tears.

“Noah is the best boy,” I said softly. “Mom’s going to take you home to live with your uncle, alright?”

Chapter 3

Noah stared at the drawing for a long moment before quietly setting it aside.

“Dad’s bad to Mom, and bad to me too. I don’t want a dad anymore.”

I pinched his cheek gently, but when my eyes fell on the smiling figures in the picture, my vision blurred.

When we first got married, Ethan and I had both dreamed of having a child of our own.

Maybe it was because neither of us had happy childhoods that we craved happiness so badly.

When I first got pregnant, he spent every night researching pregnancy and infant care, knowing more than any nanny.

He even joyfully filled an entire room with baby supplies himself.

I teased him for not even knowing whether it was a boy or a girl.

He said it didn’t matter. What mattered was that the three of us would be together forever.

Thinking back now, that happiness felt like another lifetime.

Lydia, who had once abandoned Ethan, returned with a single sentence about having her reasons, and effortlessly shattered his forever.

I pushed the drawing aside and coaxed Noah to sleep.

The next morning, I dropped him off at kindergarten and went home to pack a few things.

Julian would arrive the next day. I didn’t want to delay our departure.

That afternoon, my phone buzzed nonstop.

\[Claire, look at the news. It’s all about Ethan!\]

I opened it.

The headlines showed Ethan carrying Lydia into St. Helena Private Hospital late at night, cradling her like something priceless.

\[Cole Group CEO Rushes First Love to Hospital at Midnight, True Love Reunited\]

\[Old-Money Heiress Betrayed as First Love Returns as ‘Third Party’\]

Lydia’s background was quickly dug up.

In the comments, people argued fiercely.

\[Even if she’s mocked as a nanny, Claire Whitmore’s still the legal wife.\]

\[First love or not, they’re the real family now.\]

I scrolled calmly and replied to my friend.

\[What they do has nothing to do with me anymore.\]

Just as I was about to put my phone down, Lydia’s headlines vanished.

They were replaced by something far more familiar and cruel.

\[Original Wife Driven to Suicide, Whitmore Patriarch Remarries Within a Week\]

\[Heiress Claire Whitmore Throws Tantrum at Wedding, Father Slaps Her in Public!\]

I didn’t need to guess who was behind it.

To protect Lydia, Ethan had dragged the Whitmore family scandal and my deepest wounds back into the open.

Memories flooded in, my hands trembling uncontrollably.

My father was unfaithful. My mother loved too deeply. That doomed marriage ended with her jumping to her death.

I hated the man who destroyed her.

So at ten years old, I’d stormed his second wedding, smashing everything in sight with a stick.

My father had guards restrain me and slapped me repeatedly, forcing me to apologize to his mistress.

No one dared intervene. Only Ethan, brought along by his elders, stepped forward.

“Adults who do wrong, forcing a child to apologize?”

“I’ve called the police. You’ll be punished.”

I remembered that moment for twelve years. That was why, when Cole Group collapsed, I married Ethan despite Julian’s objections.

And now, he had torn that scar open with his own hands. The pain was raw and bloody.

I was about to call Julian to take the news down when the door was kicked open.

Ethan stormed in and slapped me hard, then seized my throat, hatred raging in his eyes.

“Claire Whitmore, I completely underestimated you. You’re ruthless.”

Dazed from the blow, I instinctively protested. “I didn’t do anything…”

He slapped me again and slammed me into the cabinet, looming over me. “You followed me on purpose and had them release Lydia’s news.”

“Those headlines triggered her depression. She almost slit her wrists!”

Only then did I notice the figure behind him.

Lydia’s eyes were red as she spoke tearfully. “Claire, why would you do this to me?”

Chapter 4

Out of Ethan’s sight, she flashed a smug smile. She had done it on purpose.

Gritting through the pain, I struggled to stand, fury burning in my eyes.

Before I could move, Ethan stepped in front of her. He was afraid I’d hurt her.

I wiped the blood from my lip and laughed, my heart aching sharply.

Noah appeared out of nowhere. “You bad people! Don’t bully my mom!”

Though no one touched Lydia, she conveniently fell, knocking over a vase.

“Ethan…”

He turned and saw her on the floor, dirtied and crying.

He helped her up and checked her anxiously, never once noticing the blood on my mouth.

Suddenly, he yanked Noah over and slapped him hard.

“Apologize!”

Everything happened too fast. By the time I reacted, Noah was pinned to the floor, his face pressed down.

I shoved Ethan away. “Ethan Cole, are you insane? He’s your son!”

Seeing Noah’s swollen face streaked with blood, tears spilled from my eyes.

He didn’t cry, only stared at Ethan with blazing hatred.

We had sworn Noah would never grow up like we did. In the end, we broke that promise.

I scooped Noah up, grabbed my bag, and turned to leave. I didn’t want to stay here another second.

Lydia spoke again. “Ethan, this is all my fault. Maybe I should just die.”

She picked up a shard from the broken planter and pressed it to her arm.

Ethan rushed over and knocked it away, his rage exploding.

“Security, take them both. And bring the whip for their punishment.”

“If you don’t know what’s wrong, then you’ll learn.”

The bodyguards rushed in, tearing Noah from my arms.

Ethan took the leather whip and struck Noah without hesitation.

Noah screamed.

I stared in disbelief. He had really done it.

“Ethan Cole! You’re beating your own son for her?”

I struggled wildly but was held down.

Another strike landed on Noah, but the seven-year-old remained silent, not shedding a single cry.

“You’re a bad man! You’re not my dad!”

Ethan was fully enraged. He lashed him again and again.

Watching Noah collapse in a pool of blood, I bit down on the hand restraining me.

As they loosened in pain, I lunged forward and shielded Noah with my body.

“Ethan, if you don’t stop now, Noah and I will have nothing to do with you for the rest of our lives!”

The resolve in my voice stunned him.

Lydia stepped closer. “Ethan, Noah made a mistake. If he’s undisciplined, it’s because his mother failed to teach him. Punishment is necessary.”

Ethan snapped out of it and nodded. “You’re right. This is for his own good.”

“Claire, since you failed as a mother, you should be punished too.”

The whip struck me. With my previous injuries, I coughed up blood.

I looked at Ethan and smiled through tears. “Ethan Cole, meeting you is the greatest regret of my life.”

He didn’t hear me. He kept striking, again and again.

Eventually, I couldn’t even move my fingers. I only shielded Noah by instinct.

Just as my consciousness faded, the villa doors were kicked open.

A furious voice thundered through the room.

===

**The Extinction of Moderates**

---

If the 2024 Federal elections were a tremor that threw items off shelves, the 2026 snap Federal elections were the earthquake that cracked the very foundations. As the final tallies come in one sobering truth has come through: Belgium looks less like a divided nation and more like two different armies standing at a heavily militarized border.

In 2024, De Wever’s N-VA had established themselves as kingmakers, balancing a demand for greater Flemish autonomy with the very real desire to govern. Today that kingmaker has seen his party fall from twenty-four seats to nineteen. The De Wever “brand”, once seen as a sophisticated slightly edge-y forefront of Flemish nationalism, was a casualty of the April Riots. His metaphors of Rome and the death of the Republic were no match for the visceral, angry, storm that followed the death of Martine Bogaert.

The moderate Flemish has died. They found themselves occupied, their sister beaten to death, and a government that would have peace over justice. Vlaams Belang, buoyed by the ZegHaarNaam movement and an outright rejection of the King of Belgium has increased from twenty seats in 2020 to twenty-seven, becoming the largest party in the country, a mandate not to reform Belgium but to take Flanders and its prosperity and leave.

---

**The Red Wall of Wallonia**

---

The black-and-yellow surge of the Flemish was met with a mirror image in Wallonia. In 2024 PTB-PVDA, the only cross-border party, was a rising force but one that was contained. The party finds itself growing from fifteen seats in 2025 to eighteen with fears of economic uncertainty in a country that itself feels besieged by Flemish fascists. Parti Socialiste, a Walloon party, has held steadfast since 2024. Holding on to their twenty seats they signal their own defiance, no backtracking on a single euro of the social safety net.

---

**The Liberal Slow Death**

---

Perhaps the singular most shocking aspect of this election has been the sheer absence of the blue liberal. Mouvement Réformateur slumped from twenty seats in 2024 to seventeen in this latest round of elections. Their proximity to the caretaker government a detriment. Open Vld, now Anders, managed to hold on to their seven seats in the middle of this tsunami. CD&V, once a voice of reason in Flanders, have themselves lost a seat. With the loss of ground to both the Flemish radicals of the north and the socialism of the south will any voice of reason find itself heard?

---

**The Impossible Chamber**

---

For many years now there has been a gentleman’s agreement, a Cordon Sanitaire, to never govern with the far-right. It was a difficult but useful tool for the continued existence of the Belgian state. Tonight, it appears to be a mathematical impossibility.

With Vlaams Belang(27) and PTB-PVDA(18) holding a combined forty-five seats in the Chamber there is no path to a majority, at least not one that can actually exist, without the involvement of extremist parties. The mediator government of Guy Verhofstadt has not just failed to lower the temperature of Belgium, it has secured the evaporation of the political middle.

---

**What Is Next?**

---

The Mediator government lead by Verhofstadt had done the unthinkable and impossible: it has made the country more polarized than darkest parts of the 2011 gridlock. By intervening in the democratic process the King has created a vacuum that was filled not by reason but rage. As the sun rises over a fractured “nation” one thing is certain. The Cold Peace is ending. The math of the election suggests that Belgium cannot be governed, only partitioned or held together by force.

---

**The Day of Reckoning**

---

Just weeks before the election Filip Dewinter, the firebrand veteran of the old guard of Vlaams Belang, had taken control of the party as the party’s rhetoric shifted from simple sovereignty to full unbridled independence. Standing on a balcony looking out over a crowd proudly waving the Strijdvlaggen and chanting “Vlaanderen Staat!” he prepares his speech.
  
“Citzens, my fellow Flemish! Tonight, the Cordon Sanitaire hasn’t just broken it has been trampled into dust. For decades they have tried to bury the Flemish spirit under the guise of respectability. They called us pariahs, they called us extremists, they used their state-funded media to spit in our faces. But tonight the pariahs are the masters of Flanders.

The elites in Brussels, the King, his cronies and the god-hating socialists in Walloon, thought they could silence us. They thought if they occupied our great Nation they would have us cower in fear and pray for peace and silence. They thought that by killing Martine Bogaert we would hand over our future for fears of reprisal. Flanders does not forget, and now **Flanders Will Not Forgive.**

For too long the Flemish movement has been lead by those that would sell us to masters in the south and Brussels. De Wever promised you that if you just played along that confederation would save Flanders, that Brussels would eventually give you your freedom. To the leaders of Wallonia, your so-called “Red Wall” is a farce to prevent panic. You use our taxes, our hard-earned euros, to build your socialist paradise. For decades you have lived as parasites on the backs of Flemish people. I have a message for Liege and Namur. The ATM is closed. The bank is empty. The locks are being changed. From this moment on not a singular cent will cross that border. If you want a socialist paradise build it with whatever money you may have.

And to the man in the palace, King Phillipe, you broke your neutrality to keep Flanders down. You choose to be a politician so you receive the reward of one. You are not our king. You are a guest in a country that no longer wants you. Take your mediators, your troops, and your kingdom and return to Brussels, or better yet Wallonia.

Tomorrow we do not go to Brussels begging for a coalition. We will go to Brussels and declare our sovereignty, we will define our borders, we will protect our people. Flanders will put our Eigen Volk Eerst in every law, in every street, and in every heart.

The lion has been caged for a hundred years. Tonight the cage has been opened and the lion is hungry.

**Vlaanderen Staat! België Sterft!**

**The Pact of Hertoginnedal and the Iron Ring**

---

June 21st, 2026. Hertoginnedal Chateau, Brussels, Belgium.
===

The dawn that broke over the forest of Soignes on that fateful day was grey, humid, heavy with the scent of damp earth and diesel. Inside Hertoginnedal chateau the air was even heavier. It smelled of stale coffee and the frantic sour sweat of men who had spent the night in a panic.
Bart De Wever stood near a tall window, staring out over the gravel driveway where federal police stood in silent, unmoving lines. In his hand a small bronze coin, Roman naturally, he had always felt safest in the company of history. Not this morning however, today history felt like a solemn teacher prepared to smack his hands for not paying attention. He had spent his entire career playing a grand game of chess, moving the pieces towards eventual confederation. Now, Filip Dewinter had flipped that board and started swinging at its players.

“He’s on that balcony again.” A voice, raspy and unsteady, came from the shadows of the library.

De Wever turned. Paul Magnette, leader of Parti Socialiste, looked like a man who had aged a decade in a night. His tie undone, his sleeves rolled up, and his eyes bloodshot.

“He’s not just on that balcony, Paul” De Wever said, low and with a hint of despair, “He’s in the bloodstream. We can’t purge that with a speech.”

---

**The Pact of Hertoginnedal**

--

They sat at the heavy oak table. The Pact of Hertoginnedal laid out in front of them like a death warrant. It was grotesque, a subversion of political will, and yet still a glimmer of hope.

“The regionalization of social security,” Magnette whispered, his pen hovering over the paper, “If I sign this, my people will call me a traitor. I am handing you the keys to the treasury.”

“And if you don’t” De Wever leaned in gaining some form of his previous statesmanship, “Dewinter won’t ask for the keys. He’ll burn down the bank with all of us in it.”

The terms were brutal. Guy Verhofstadt had already been forced to resign three hours earlier. His dream of a unified European heartland shattered by Flemish rhetoric. The King, who had chosen to play hero, was to be erased quietly. The draft in front of them would strip all remaining power from him. He was to be moved to the attic of history, a ceremonial ghost to keep tourists happy.

The doors to the library creaked open, admitting two figures who looked like they had just survived a tornado. Nadia Naji of the Groen party and Rajae Maoane of Ecolo entered the room with the hesitant gait of people entering a hospital room expecting the worst.

Magnette didn’t look up from the paper in front of him. De Wever gave them a curt, short, nod.

“We need the numbers” Magnette said bluntly. “And we need the optics. A national pact looks more like a coup if all normal parties don’t come together.”

Naji stepped forward, her voice trembling but still clear, “Frankly we aren’t here to provide optics Paul. We’re here to ensure that while you two are busy chopping up the corpse of Belgium you don’t sell its lungs.”

The price for their seat at Hertoginnedal was bitter.

First they had to accept the Nuclear Eternity clause. The coalition would demand that recent plans to reach out to the French to build new reactors in Wallonia would be respected and that the remaining units in Doel and Tihange would be kept going for as long as is safe to do. For Ecolo it was a betrayal of their founding myth; for Groen it was a surrender to the old world they had tried to leave.

Second they would have to stomach the fiscal divorce. By agreeing to the Pact they were signaling the end of the Belgian solidarity both parties had fought hard for.

What did they hope to gain from this?

Firstly they had secured a cross-border ecological authority. The environment was to be a neutral zone neither side would touch. Part of the federal budget, even as the rest was divided, would remain a cross-Belgium fund.

Secondly, and less so, a seat at the governing table. A table that had increasingly become more unstable as the legs were cut out from underneath it.

With shaking hands they both signed the Pact and breathed a little more than they had all night. 

---

**The Iron Ring**

---

Outside, the digital world was screaming. The Iron Ring coalition, a desperate alliance of the N-VA, PS, MR, CD&V, LE, Groen, and Ecolo, was being mocked as a junta of losers.

In the corridors of Hertoginnedal, Georges-Louis Bouchez was on a secure line talking to President Macron of France, his voice rising in panic as he described shadow citizen militias at the Flemish border. Movement Reform was a terrified witness to the marriage ending in murder-suicide.

“We sign” Magnette said suddenly “We give you your autonomy and your “Confederation of Necessity” But the military stays in the ports and the airports, the flag stays flying at all federal buildings. For now at least Bart.” Magnette slumped back in his chair, his face deep in his hands with not a whimper more.

De Wever signed below him, his hand steady but cold. He had achieved his confederation. Yet it tasted not of miasma but of ash. He hadn’t won it through logic or reason. He hadn’t really even won it through the ballot. He had been handed it as a bribe to keep a madman from the gates.

As the sun rose higher that morning the Pact of Hertoginnedal was whisked away by a waiting courier. It was a dam made of paper to hold back the black-and-yellow waves.

“We’ve bought ourselves a week” Magnette said slowly and without confidence that even that was true.

De Wever returned to the window. “In this country Paul a week is a lifetime. But I fear the Romans had better poets for its funeral than we do.”",2,1770094358.0,GlobalPowers,0,1.0,False

Here is some proof that they send people to discredit you by calling you crazy and acting like they are not a mason. They did it on my previous post but then admitted it was them then threw a tantrum because I won't join them. They are doing the same thing here in this comment section

[Masonic Tantrum After I Exposed the Truth - Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/masonic-tantrum-after-i-exposed-truth-QOKvKS9)



Here is their secret

Study astrology, alchemy, witchcraft, voodoo, etc. The topics that they want you to believe are ridiculous. They are very real. They don't want you to study it because they don't want you to gain that much power and use it against them.  

The 12 apostles are based on the 12 zodiac signs. Jesus lived to be 33 years old, there are also 33 degrees in the Masonic Scottish Rite. There are 33 bones in your spine. The kundalini begins at the base of your spine when the moon passes through your zodiac sign each month.  

They intentionally threw off this cycle by making 12 months in a year rather than 13 months to match the 13 zodiac signs. The solar calendar does not match the lunar calendar on purpose. The 13th zodiac was erased from history. The Ophiuchus or the serpent bearer, like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent in the garden is debated to be Lucifer. Both Lucifer and Jesus are known as the morning star. Venus is also known as the morning star. 

Each day it ascends one bone as long as you refrain from the deadly sins. No sex, no wrath, no gluttony, that's why fasting is important. And also, why we as Americans are over fed and have a higher rate of obesity. Because they are trying to stuff our faces with food, so we don't accidentally open our third eye. Also, no acidic foods. It will destroy the kundalini. No coffee either. If it is a major addiction in the US then avoid it. No caffeine, no sugar, no nicotine, no drugs, and so on. The only exception is DMT, I know this is a psychedelic drug that they use in their rituals to assist in opening their third eye.  

Everything in the US is structured to make sure we never reach this state.  

Lust, Men are taught that the more women they have sex with the cooler they are. Women are taught that OnlyFans is empowering. Porn is also free and sex is in all media.  

Envy, we are taught to envy the rich. Their expensive homes, their fast cars, designer clothes, and exotic trips. 

Wrath, we are taught to hate each other for one reason or another whether it be for race, religion, sex, political beliefs, etc.  

Pride, we are taught to take pride in our nation to the point of ignorance and blind belief in authority. 

Gluttony, we are overfed as Americans which is why we have such a high rate of obesity. Our food is also tainted with ingredients that hinder our chances of reaching this state. Eat kosher foods, the tiny hats that are hiding this information would not do this to their own people.

Sloth, we are fed sites like Tik Tok and social media where we spend more time doom scrolling than we do exercising or attempting to build a better life for ourselves. 

Greed, we are taught to look out after ourselves only. We are made to believe in the scarcity mindset, where there aren't enough resources to go around so we keep more for ourselves and never share.  We take more than we need and even at the cost of others.

You must also feel authentic compassion towards others. The point is to open your heart. The saying ""Heart of gold"" did not come from nowhere. Scientists found that there are more pathways sending signals from the heart to the brain than from the brain to the heart. There is a reason the heart was considered the most important part of your body in ancient times. 

Once it makes it to the top of our spine into the pineal gland it stays there for a few days. Jesus was resurrected on the third day. On the third day it drops down back to the base of our spine.  

Congratulations you are now a god. You can manipulate reality around you and even read minds of others. Your mind will exist on a higher plane than this 3 dimensional one so you can access other objects that are on that plane though unconsciously, including other people's minds. You will retain your memory after death because this body is temporary, but your mind has now accessed a higher plane of existence. You will be born in a new body after some time of void and darkness, but you will keep all the memories of your past life. You are now also immortal.  

I believe they may have possibly left some information out, but this is the truth that I know so far. You may have to wait until the full moon passes through your zodiac sign. You also might have to do the Wim Hoff miracle breathing technique regularly while meditating on your chakras. And they may have left out important information about Venus, but I am not sure.  ",4,1770093859.0,Subliminal,2,1.0,False
1quikqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1quikqv/its_over_lol/,its over lol...?,"writing here because i just need to let it all out

on wednesday my (24f) husband (25m)(got married in may but we have been together since april 2020) came home from the gym and said we're over

hes reasoning was that our personalities are too different now and that the cleaning has gotten out of control (i struggle to clean bc of lack of energy and i work 38hrs a week at an evil coffee shop) in the past he had mentioned this but i didnt know how dire it had been i also have autism and struggle to pick up on tones sometimes (also we have lived together 2+ years)

there was really nothing i could do to change his mind and he packed up and left

he came back the next day and i asked a few questions for clarity 

are you cheating? no

are we single? no

do i delete pics from socials? no why would we do that

can we talk to someone first? no im done its past that

all while his wallpaper at the time was still an image of us

at the end of this conversation he said he would consider couples counseling but he really didnt think it would work out

he left again after that, a couples days later he removed me from the icloud family and i messaged him asking to talk because i needed some more answers 

i talked to his friends as well and they all think hes being impulsive and childish considering we are married not just dating, one of his friend also said that he has been really stressed and it seems like he just decided to blow up without considering me- that hes trying to deal with things on his own rather than with me his wife since now we are in this together (recently he had been given the chance to move us potentialy out of state for work and if is his last semester of college as well)

i suggested we talk to someone and he shut it all down immediately and i cant force him to do anything

for context i moved 3-4hrs away from my family and everything i ever knew to be closer to him, for the past 4.5yrs ive been building a life with/around him

because of whats happening i needed to know if i needed to quit my job etc bc i cannot afford to live here and id need to move back home

he asked why i didnt move to \[closer city\] with my cousins and i said they hadnt moved yet and he suggested i can move with them, i truly dont know why he would care where i go

he said he would try and serve me papers before i left so that it could be easier for us... lol

i asked about our instagram photos and he just said ""well i havent taken mine down"" he said lets just wait for this to calm down a second

and yes i did ask if he was cheating on me, personally i dont think he would and neither do his friends but i had to ask because some signs were pointing to yes, after a solid conversation he said he wasnt and im choosing to believe him because i cant afford to care atm

at the end of the day i know i cant change things

right now i am packing and cleaning up a bit, i hope that once im gone he realizes what he did, the apartment is still gonna be a ""mess"" even without my things here, but all i can do is focus on what i can control and not dwell on the things i know nothing about

but deep down i know hes a good guy and i truly think hes just going through a rough time, its just unfortunate that i have to be a victim of his choices right now

unfortunately i do have a tiny ounce of hope that he will regret this and come back (a couple years ago when he first spoke of moving in together he was excited then a few weeks later he asked for us to go on a break bc he needed to think of the relationship and didnt know if we would stay together, then 2 weeks later he reached back out we continued the relationship and moved in together a month later)

if he was to come back its gonna take A LOT for me to forgive him, this is traumatic for me as i already suffer from anxiety/depression/ocd. if he was to come back i think we would need to build a solid communication method or talk to a professional

How to establish better control?,"Initially posted this in relationshipadvice, big mistake. So I'm posting it here where presumably it won't be answered by a bunch of snowflakes.

I need some outside perspective here. My girlfriend and I have been together for two years, and initially, things were perfect. She fit the visual profile I require for a partner perfectly. But lately, she’s been letting herself go, and it’s honestly disrespectful to the effort I put into curating our lifestyle. We agreed early on (I stated it clearly and she didn't object) that 125 lbs is the hard ceiling for her frame. It’s not about health, it’s about maintaining the asset value of the relationship and ensuring she remains visually compatible with me.

The problem is she’s currently sitting at 127.4 lbs according to yesterday’s daily weight report. I have her step on the scale every morning at 6:00 AM sharp, before water or coffee, so I can log the data into our shared spreadsheet for tracking her weight. I’ve tried to be supportive and proactive. I’ve completely taken over the grocery shopping so she doesn't get tempted by garbage, and I’ve explicitly banned carbohydrates after 2 PM. I even instituted a structured snack allowance where she gets one plain, unsalted rice cake at 3 PM if her morning weigh-in was within spec. If she’s over, that privilege is obviously revoked until she stabilizes. It’s a simple incentive structure, yet she complains about being ""lightheaded"" or ""starving."" It feels wildly manipulative and dramatic.

I actually caught her sneaking a granola bar from her work bag last Tuesday and I nearly lost it. I had to sit her down and explain that calories are a budget, and she’s spending money she doesn’t have. I’ve started randomly auditing her purse and coat pockets for contraband when she gets home, but I suspect she’s eating at the office behind my back. It’s the deceit that hurts the most, honestly.

I’m looking for advice from other men who successfully manage their partner's intake. What practical control measures have you found successful to stop the sneaking? I’m thinking about maybe installing a Wyze cam in the kitchen facing the pantry or perhaps requesting photos of her lunch every day with a timestamp so I can approve the portion size. Is that effective, or do they just find other ways to cheat?

1quikfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1quikfn/the_real_financial_red_flags_before_moving_in/,The REAL Financial Red Flags Before Moving In Together (Science-Based Guide Nobody Mentions),"Studied breakups and relationship finance disasters for months (books, research, therapists, reddit threads) and realized most couples ignore the money conversation until they're already trapped in a lease together, splitting bills wrong, and resenting each other.

Here's the thing. Most relationship advice tells you to ""just communicate about money"" but nobody explains what the actual red flags look like until it's too late. Your partner might seem financially responsible on dates, but living together exposes everything. The daily spending habits, the impulsive Amazon orders at 2am, the ""I'll pay you back"" that never happens.

I'm not talking about income differences or who makes more, that's manageable. I'm talking about the psychological money patterns that destroy relationships. The deeper stuff that even financially stable people overlook.

Here's what actually matters:

**they avoid the money conversation entirely**

If your partner deflects, jokes away, or gets defensive every time you try discussing finances before moving in, that's your sign. Healthy adults can have uncomfortable conversations. People who panic when you mention a budget or shared expenses are usually hiding something, debt they're ashamed of, spending they can't control, or just complete financial chaos they don't want you to see.

Research shows financial infidelity (hiding purchases, secret credit cards, lying about debt) affects 40% of couples and it's one of the top predictors of divorce. Starts with small omissions before you move in together.

**different money personalities with zero compromise**

One of you is a saver, one's a spender, that's normal. The problem is when neither person is willing to meet in the middle. If they mock your budgeting as ""controlling"" or you judge their occasional splurge as ""irresponsible,"" you're cooked.

There's this concept from financial therapists called ""money scripts,"" basically the subconscious beliefs about money you absorbed growing up. Some people learned ""money is meant to be enjoyed now"" while others learned ""spending is dangerous, always save."" Neither is wrong but they need to coexist.

Try the app Honeydue for couples managing shared finances. It's genuinely helpful for tracking shared expenses without being invasive about personal spending. Connects to bank accounts, splits bills automatically, lets you set budgets together. Made specifically for couples who want transparency without fighting.

**they have zero financial boundaries**

This goes both ways. Either they're way too enmeshed (wants to combine everything immediately, gets offended if you want separate accounts) or they're completely closed off (refuses to share any financial info even though you're about to sign a lease together).

Healthy couples maintain some financial independence while being transparent. You don't need joint bank accounts for everything but you absolutely need to know if your partner has $40k in credit card debt before you're legally tied to a lease together.

**no emergency fund whatsoever**

If your partner is living paycheck to paycheck with zero savings and they're not in genuinely dire circumstances, that's a lifestyle choice. Means when the car breaks down or they lose their job, you're suddenly covering everything. Or worse, you're both scrambling and the relationship becomes about financial survival instead of partnership.

Financial expert Ramit Sethi talks about this in his book ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" (bestselling personal finance book, over 1 million copies sold, actually funny and realistic unlike most finance books). He breaks down how couples should approach money before major commitments. The emergency fund chapter alone is worth the read. Best practical finance book that doesn't make you feel like garbage for not having your life together at 23.

**they expect you to subsidize their lifestyle**

Subtle at first. They suggest apartments you can't afford but they ""really love."" They want to split groceries 50/50 but buy expensive organic everything while you're budgeting. They're always ""short"" when bills are due but somehow afford concerts and new clothes.

This isn't about income differences, it's about respect. If someone makes less but is conscious about shared expenses, that's fine. But if they expect you to fund a lifestyle they can't afford themselves, you're becoming a parent not a partner.

**completely different financial goals**

You're trying to save for a house, they think homeownership is a scam and want to travel forever. You want to aggressively pay off student loans, they're cool carrying debt indefinitely. You're thinking retirement accounts, they're thinking ""we'll figure it out later.""

None of these are inherently wrong but they need to align somewhat. Psychologist Dr. John Gottman's research (studied 3,000+ couples over decades, can predict divorce with 90% accuracy) found that couples who can't compromise on major life goals have the highest failure rates. Money is just the tangible representation of those goals.

**they've never lived independently**

Went from parents' house to college dorms to living with roommates to wanting to move in with you. They've never paid all their own bills, managed a full household budget, or dealt with unexpected expenses alone.

You're about to find out they have no idea how much utilities cost, or that you actually have to buy toilet paper regularly, or that rent is due on the first not ""whenever i remember.""

**past financial behavior they refuse to acknowledge**

Bankruptcies, evictions, repossessions, whatever. Everyone makes mistakes and past financial disasters aren't automatic dealbreakers. But if they can't discuss what happened, what they learned, and how they've changed, they haven't actually processed it. Means they'll probably repeat those patterns.

The book ""The Financial Diet"" by Chelsea Fagan addresses this really well. She's brutally honest about her own financial screwups and how to actually recover and build better habits. Not some finance bro telling you to stop buying coffee, actual realistic advice for people who've messed up and need to rebuild.

For anyone wanting to level up their understanding of relationship psychology and financial patterns, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books on topics like this. You can ask it to build a learning plan around ""navigating financial conversations in relationships"" or ""understanding money psychology as a couple,"" and it generates personalized audio content based on your specific situation, whether you're dealing with a spender-saver dynamic or trying to align long-term financial goals.

It customizes everything from a quick 15-minute overview to a deeper 40-minute exploration with real examples. The knowledge comes from vetted sources like relationship research, financial therapy studies, and expert insights, so it's not just generic advice. Worth checking out if this kind of targeted learning appeals to you.

**here's what to actually do:**

Have the uncomfortable conversation now. Before you tour apartments, before you get excited about decorating, sit down and discuss:

Current income and debts

Credit scores (yeah really, if you're signing a lease together this matters)

Spending habits and budgeting styles

How you'll split rent and bills (50/50, proportional to income, something else)

Emergency fund situation

Financial goals for the next year and five years

What happens if someone loses their job

Try the website Splitwise if you need a neutral way to track shared expenses without judgment. Originally made for roommates but works great for couples who want to keep some finances separate while being fair about shared costs.

Moving in together is essentially a financial merger. You're combining households, which means combining financial risk. Someone's bad credit can affect your ability to rent certain places. Someone's lack of savings becomes your problem when emergencies hit. Someone's spending habits will directly impact your financial stability.

But here's the thing, and this is crucial, financial incompatibility isn't always a dealbreaker if both people are willing to work on it. The actual red flag is unwillingness to discuss it, change, compromise, or acknowledge problems.

Good relationships can survive financial differences. They can't survive financial dishonesty, avoidance, or fundamental disrespect around money.

So have the conversation. If they react badly to reasonable questions about finances before a major commitment like moving in together, you just learned something incredibly valuable about them. If they engage honestly even if it's uncomfortable, you're probably good.

1quikf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1quikf0/espresso_machine_buying_advice_3k/,Espresso machine buying advice [3k],"Hi 

I am looking at upgrading my current breville bambino to something with a dual boiler. I make milk drinks every day for my wife and I and then for groups up to ten when we have friends and family over. The steam wand on my bambino can be weak and can take a while to steam milk. I’ve been using the machine nearly everyday for 2.5 years and love the ritual of making my daily coffee. 

I have been looking on the Clive Coffee store and was initially leaning towards the profitec move because I feel like it was a natural upgrade from the bambino due to its volumetric dosing. 

I am however intrigued by the prospect of flow control to get more out of the shots I pull and the potential for experimentation there. I also find the e61 style machines more aesthetically pleasing and so now I’m leaning towards the profitec ride with flow control.

My daily coffee is usually just a quick one as I sit down for work in the morning. I’m not doing much experimentation and use local beans that I like most always. 

The concerns I have with the drive are that it will be more difficult for my wife to use as she will have to watch the shot and it’s not as simple as just pressing the two shot button on the bambino. 

However I feel that if I dial in everything correctly she could use the shot timer and be just fine. She’s very good with the machine as well but definitely likes the ease of a volumetric dose.

All that being said is there a machine you would steer me to. 

As for my grinder I use the timemore 64s and have really enjoyed the coffee after upgrading from a baratza esp 6 months ago. ",1,1770093810.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1quij4j,https://i.redd.it/wja4h4pdl7hg1.png,Rainbow Rifle – Seeking feedback on a collaborative/social venture model,"I’m a veteran and have been following this community for a minute. I am currently in the research phase for a project called Rainbow Rifle.
​My primary motivation is the lack of genuine community investment from dominant ""tactical"" coffee brands. Despite their heavy ""veteran-owned"" marketing, there is very little evidence that these large corporations actually give back to the communities they claim to represent. I am positioning Rainbow Rifle as a social entrepreneurial venture rather than a standard retail brand.
​The Collaborative Model:
Instead of a traditional standalone roaster, the goal is a collaborative operation. I am looking to roast in partnership with politically aligned coffee shops and community organizations. The brand would act as a vehicle for these partnerships, with a portion of the revenue directly supporting community initiatives or mutual aid projects rather than just going to a bottom line.
​I also run an Etsy shop, DUBConcepts, which produces street-art style vinyl stickers. This arm of the project would handle the visual identity and merch for these specific collaborations.
​I’m looking for feedback on the following:
​Does a collaborative model (roasting specifically for/with aligned shops) resonate more with you than just another standalone ""political"" coffee brand?
​For a ""social venture,"" what kind of transparency or ""giving back"" actually carries weight for you?
​Any thoughts on using this specific branding (the ""Rainbow Rifle"" aesthetic) as a tool for community-focused partnerships?
​I have no product to sell yet—I’m purely interested in whether this collaborative operational model is something the community would actually support before I scale up my roasting equipment. Thanks in advance y'all! ",33,1770093706.0,armedsocialists,5,0.9,False

I find my quiet, meeting free time extremely valuable and helpful to keep me sane in this line of work. 

Im not trying to just bitch but it feels like this role just finds a new way to increase hours + workload but pay you less.

1quiikb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowYourNonprofit/comments/1quiikb/fundraising_ideas_that_actually_work_beyond_the/,Fundraising Ideas That Actually Work (Beyond the Typical Bake Sale),"Hey everyone! 👋

Fundraising doesn't have to be complicated. Here are the proven strategies that actually move the needle:

**Low-Effort, High-Impact Ideas**

**Peer-to-peer fundraising** is your secret weapon. Let supporters create their own fundraising pages and ask their networks. You reach new donors without burning out your team.

**Text-to-give and QR codes** work because people are lazy—in the best way. One-step giving gets way more participation.

**Give Something Up challenges** are surprisingly effective. Ask donors to skip daily coffee or subscriptions for a month and donate what they'd spend. It's relatable and motivating.

**Events That Raise Real Money**

Small, frequent events beat big annual galas. Try:

* Movie or trivia nights (partner with local businesses to keep costs low)
* Skill-sharing workshops (cooking, crafting, flower arranging)
* Themed competitions (cooking contests, costume challenges)
* Fitness events (walks, yoga, cycling)

**What Actually Works**

The fundraisers that succeed share these traits:

1. Clear purpose – Tell people exactly where their money goes
2. Low barrier to entry – Make participation easy and flexible
3. Community vibes – Make it fun, social, and inclusive
4. Leverage your network – Ask your board, volunteers, and donors to share

**The Key Insight**

The best fundraiser isn't the biggest or most elaborate. It's the one your team can execute well while supporters actually want to participate in. Start with something manageable, track what works, and build from there.
