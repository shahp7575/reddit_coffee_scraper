Beyond the gift card, what makes Vitality a bit different is the built-in rewards and incentives for looking after your health.

What you get:
- Fast access to private healthcare (with health plans)
- Financial protection for you or your loved ones (with life cover)
- 5 Star Defaqto rated cover across a range of products
- Access to Vitality’s rewards programme
- Vitality rewards and benefits can include:
- Discounts on gym memberships and fitness brands
- Rewards for hitting activity targets (such as weekly coffees, cinema tickets or other partner perks depending on your status)
- Savings on smartwatches and fitness devices
- Discounts on healthy food and lifestyle brands
- Travel and leisure discounts
- Premium discounts at renewal for staying active (depending on your plan and status)

Link: https://referral.vitality.co.uk/thomash-6864

The more engaged you are with your health (steps, workouts, check-ups, etc.), the more rewards and potential savings you can unlock. It’s designed to incentivise healthier habits rather than just provide cover.

Vitality supports over 1.7 million UK members, and several of its Health, Life, Serious Illness and Income Protection products have received top ratings from Defaqto for comprehensiveness.
How the £100 referral works:
- You must take out a qualifying personal health or life plan directly with Vitality (not via a third party).
Minimum £25 monthly premium applies.
- The £100 gift card is sent once the first three monthly premiums have been collected.

By taking part, you agree to the Platform Terms & Conditions and Promotion Terms & Conditions.
If you were already looking into private healthcare or life insurance, it may be worth checking the referral route before applying :)",1,1771432677.0,DiscountCodesUK,0,1.0,False

Yes, that is actually my name, I'm not a crazy weeb haha. I'm half Japanese. :) I'm originally from the USA, but I live in Germany now with my awesome husband (who I actually met on reddit too)!

My main hobbies are animals, art (mostly collecting these days), and video games. I have 2 cats, 1 dog, 2 lizards, 4 snakes, and 7 (?) spiders haha. One even lives on my desk, her name is Nyx and she's my baby. :) Art well.. that one takes awhile to explain, but I'll ramble on it if you let me! Video games, right now I'm mostly playing WoW (almost DLC time!!) in small intervals as I'm trying to heal a nerve in my WASD arm haha. I'm starting to like cooking and coffee... I blame my family here haha. I love anime and manga when I'm in the mood, and reading horror books (reading the Luminous Dead right now). Also love cheesy period romance dramas and horror movies.

Feel free to ask for my playlist for my taste in music haha.

I tend to live life day by day. I'm a very in the moment person.

At first it was hilarious. He would whisper stuff like ""the parent prepares coffee while avoiding eye contact with reality"" and I laughed because ok thats funny and honestly accurate. But now it happens CONSTANTLY. Making dinner, folding laundry, trying to answer emails, everything comes with a running commentary.



The issue is that he also adds dramatic interpretations that arent always flattering lol. Yesterday while I was looking for my keys he loudly announced ""the adult has lost another important object, a common behavior pattern"". We were in a store and people around us started laughing and I wasnt sure if I should feel amused or slightly roasted. Ive asked him to tone it down in public but he says he cant help it because hes ""observing for science"".



I dont want to shut down creativity because honestly I love that hes imaginative and funny. But I also feel overstimulated when theres nonstop talking about every tiny action I take. Is this just a phase I should ride out or do I set firmer limits about when commentary is ok? Anyone else have a kid latch onto a weird roleplaying habit like this and how long did it last lol.",10,1771432637.0,Parenting,17,0.78,False

Having been home for 3 weeks, I worked to really dial in my espresso process. Last year, it was focused on finding the right grind. Most recently, I added a scale to better control my shots after reading a number of posts here. I have been focusing on a 2.5:1 ratio, when I have 12g of ground to start with. 

Fast forward to this week. Starbucks just tastes watered down (like when I was pulling bad, too long shots). I used to think too many of this community were being espresso snobs. Now I get it.

The only reason I can think why this might’ve started was because I was out of shape and I was masturbating pretty regularly. I gradually noticed I had a lot less sensation. Like masturbation didn’t even feel good anymore just the orgasm really. I also noticed flaccid shrinkage and less erections and gradually less libido. I’ve had these problems for a while now. It’s been super stressful. I’ve exercised quite a lot, lost weight and I’m much healthier now. My problems are still bad. I’ve been to the Urologist twice. He did tests and an exam which said I was fine. He prescribed me pills which I take at night a low dose of cialis and I drink beet juice in the morning. When the beet juice spikes my nitric oxide in the morning is when I feel most “normal” more sensitivity better erections etc. but then if I drink coffee and eat food my symptoms gradually worsen again. My flaccid penis becomes firmer, very desensitized almost numb and feels rubbery and it’s almost impossible for me to get an erection. This has been very stressful. It makes it hard to sleep at night and I don’t get erections at night or in the morning. Sometimes I do but not every night. Idk what to do. I really feel like I need to start doing something about this and it’s not healthy for this to continue for me mentally or physically. My Urologist referred me to a pelvic floor physical therapist but that’s not for a month. Idk what this is honestly, not sure if it’s hard flaccid or what. I could really use some solutions here I’m getting desperate and each day is more stressful than the last. Thanks. ",2,1771432526.0,PelvicFloor,1,1.0,False

The old sectional is falling apart (dog chewed the arms, cushions are flat, and it's just too big for the space now that we have the baby), so we're donating most of it to Habitat for Humanity and selling the coffee table on Kijiji. We want something more modern but still comfortable, low-profile sofa with clean lines, maybe a sectional or L-shape that doesn't eat the whole room, plus a new dining table and chairs since the current set is wobbly and doesn't match anything anymore.

I'm leaning toward custom because we have weird wall angles and need exact sizes + storage under the sofa would be amazing for blankets/toys. 

What places have you used for custom/upholstered stuff in Richmond Hill or nearby? Did you go fully custom or modify something from a showroom? How long did the wait usually end up being?

I can't stand the idea of putting something into my body that would change the way I think. I think that if I did that then I wouldn't be myself anymore. As a matter of fact, I am disgusted by it so much that when someone drinks alcohol part of me doesn't view them as much as human as they were anymore. I hate this stuff so much that I have never taken a sip of coffee.

This has lost me almost all of my friends and has lead to the love of my life leaving me. She would be upset at me when I refused to speak to her after having a drink because I didn't want to even know what she sounded like under the influence. I remember one time I was in the room with her friends and they mentioned what she was like when drunk and I couldn't sleep for 4 days after that.

I have lost almost every single person of meaning in my life due to this, and the rest will go in due time, and I have zero regrets. I have 2 friends. The only people on this planet who love me are my parents, my grandparents, and my cat. I will die with no one around me who loves me knowing I did the right thing.

Some days I am glad I hold myself to this standard, and I know I am strong for it. A lot of other days I wish I wasn't born with this sickness and that I could experience things like happiness and connection with others.

Looking at starting a new class 1 job which has many different shift patterns available and I'm just looking for advice. It's mainly general haulage/curtain-sider work.

I would not even think of doing full time tramping, I'm in my thirties and live at home with my partner and we spend a lot of time together so it's just not feasible for me.

Day shift sounds great but then often you're waking up before the sun rises and you're home when it's dark, even in summer. I find that you basically (in many companies) have a very poor quality of life and you're absolutely knackered by the the time the weekend comes then have to prepare to do it all again.

I've never worked 4o4o but I'm REALLY considering it. Sure you'll be worked like a dog for 4 days, probably maxing your hours. However, then you're off, for 4 days, to do whatever you want, go to the gym, go for coffee mid-day, get shopping in, get involved in your hobbies etc. I basically think nights (home each day) or tramping (2-3 nights out) 4o4o kind of sounds great, as you really do have that 4 days of recuperation no matter how long/stressful your 4 days on have been. However as I say I haven't worked 4o4o so I might be looking at this with rose-tinted glasses.

Can anyone provide any info

1r87rd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1r87rd8/norfolk_locals_speak_about_mounjaro_amid_nhs/,Norfolk locals speak about Mounjaro amid NHS roll-out,"Some hail Mounjaro as a ""life-changing"" miracle drug, while others are concerned about its safety, cost and implications on attitudes to obesity.

It has become a huge debate over the last few years.

But people across Norfolk are now trying to cut through the noise by sharing their real, lived experiences of the weight loss jabs.

# The background

Tirzepatide – better known by its brand name Mounjaro – is a once-weekly injection that works by suppressing the user’s appetite.

It has been available from private pharmacies in the UK since early 2024, but the NHS is now in the process of rolling out prescriptions to those who need it most.

Despite the NHS’s criteria being strict – a BMI of over 40 and at least four “qualifying” weight-related conditions – the Norfolk and Waveney Integrated Care Board (ICB) has said [more than 11,000 people are expected to be eligible](https://www.edp24.co.uk/news/25801578.nhs-rolls-mounjaro-prescriptions-norfolk-waveney/?ref=ed_direct).

# ‘Life-changing’

A 23-year-old woman from Holt is among those who spoke very positively about her Mounjaro journey.

“I think it’s a great way to kick-start losing weight,” she shared. “If you combine it with exercise, it’s life-changing.

""I lost about four stone in seven months and that time taught me a lot about portion control.

“It is expensive, but it’s worth it.”

Another woman, from Norwich, said taking Mounjaro helped combat years of “constant weight gain” due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

The medication is also widely available through private pharmacies *(Image: Faye Minton)*

“I had become diabetic and was at my wits’ end with how I felt and how I looked,” the 21-year-old explained.

She worked with a dietician to try and manage her weight and “entirely changed” her lifestyle, but nothing worked.

This left her feeling “depressed” and “unlovable”.

When she heard about Mounjaro, she was “terrified” but thought it was worth taking one “last leap of faith”.

She came off the medication after successfully losing five stone.

Despite both women having positive experiences with the weight loss jab, they wanted to remain anonymous due to the stigma around using the drug.

# ‘Not a quick fix’

Others have warned users of the drug to be careful and not see it as a “quick fix” to drop a few pounds before a big event or a holiday.

Georgie Aldous, a 27-year-old influencer and business owner from Gorleston, lost four stone in five months on Mounjaro in 2024.

He ordered it from a private online pharmacy and said he followed their instructions “to a tee”, moving up to a stronger dose every month.

One person said they found Mounjaro a ""great way to kick-start"" weight loss *(Image: Chris Radburn/PA Wire)*

When he reached the third dose – 7.5mg – he could only manage to eat a banana and a coffee for breakfast, often skipping lunch and picking at a small evening meal.

It was shortly after starting the 10mg dose that he started to feel “frail”.

He begged his doctor for help and had blood tests that found he was severely deficient in vitamins and folic acid.

One night, he developed a temperature and his heart would not stop racing, leaving him “breathless”.

He was diagnosed with tachycardia after several desperate trips to A&E.

Mr Aldous stopped taking Mounjaro and he eventually recovered from the ordeal with beta blockers, but it took a long time to heal from the severe health anxiety that came as a result.

The businessman said weight loss would “never be worth” feeling the way he did.

“It’s awful that so many people feel the need to go on it,” he said. “There are so many societal pressures to lose weight – it’s insane, and it comes from everything - influencers, media, film, television.”

Mr Aldous started taking Mounjaro in 2024 *(Image: Supplied)*

He is now losing weight naturally with frequent exercise and a healthy diet, and he said he is finding it “rewarding” to do the work himself.

Since coming off the medication, he has been actively campaigning to raise awareness about the risks that can come with it.

“I think it is really important to talk about my experience because so many people don’t feel like they can tell anyone they are taking it,” he added.

He lost four stone in five months *(Image: Supplied)*

""There is such a stigma. When I was on it, I didn’t feel I could tell anyone, and if I had been okay on it, I probably wouldn’t have ever told anyone at all.

“I want people to know it is not a quick fix - it is literally a medical intervention.

“So, if you really feel you need to go on it, make sure you have tried everything else first.”

# 'Patient safety is top priority'

A spokeswoman for Lilly, the firm that produces Mounjaro, said: “Mounjaro (tirzepatide) should only be used when prescribed by a licensed healthcare professional.

“Patient safety is Lilly’s top priority. We take any reports regarding patient safety seriously and actively monitor, evaluate, and report safety information for all our medicines.



“The Mounjaro Patient Information Leaflet warns that increased heart rate (tachycardia) is a common side effect when used for type two diabetes and an uncommon side effect when used for weight management.

“We encourage patients to consult their doctor or other healthcare professional regarding any side effects they may be experiencing and to ensure that they are getting genuine Lilly medicine.”

1 or 1,5 year ago I found this genre and I found a 1 hour mix with all of the songs being awsome. I found it on youtube.

Now the thing is, I can not find it anymore. Maybe the mixtape violated something. I have tried AI to find it, it helped me to use ways I would not know normally, like specified google search or downloading my youtube history, but none of them worked.

I would like to ask for help here, maybe someone knows the mixtape or at least the playlist. 

Some help I gathered so far:

\- Title was mentioning BLACK COFFEE and also he was on the picture. 

\- The first song was: ANOTR, Abel Barder - Relax my eyes (Mr. Moudz afro house remix)

\- I know another song from the middle of the mixtape: Florence & the machine - Spectrum (Say my name) \[Marco Generani remix\]

\- There was a link with the playlist in the description, but sadly can’t remember the site name

That’s all I got, I don’t really hope for nothing but I give this a shot.

How's the humor?,"I am writing a dark comedy that involves an estranged father-son pair, shared trauma, a criminal conspiracy and a massive cosmic event that affected a whole generation throughout the American Midwest that everyone wants to forget about. I would like to see if I can get some thoughts on the prologue and first chapter. How well does the prologue hook you? Does the first chapter make you want to keep reading? And how's the humor landing? 



Here it is:

  


**Prologue** 



""I need Monday off,"" said Sam. 

She was leaning back in the lone metal folding chair, her feet up on the desk in front of her. A battered order pad hung precariously from the pocket of the half apron slung across Sam's waist, and the front feet of the chair hovered inches over the perpetually grimy tiles.

Dennis was sweating next to Sam in what was imprecisely referred to as the break room. It was more like a sardine can, tucked in the back of the kitchen just past the cooktops, dishwashers, and tweaked-out culinarians. More like an intimate meeting room where management could use the discomfort to their advantage. Supposedly.

In those days, the schedule was a living document printed in ink on several sheets of 8.5""x11"" copy paper inexpertly bound with invisible tape and stuck to the greasy wall with more invisible tape, covered over by cross-outs in black Sharpie, various colors of highlighter pen that defied order, and names scribbled in whatever writing medium was immediately available. Inches away from the toe of Sam's boot hung that document.

""You're down for a double on Monday,"" Dennis said. ""What's the matter?""

""Honestly, I just need a mental health day."" She was scrolling through her phone. ""Also, my ex is trying to kill me.""

""Still? He's really gotta give it a rest. Maybe you could switch with Brad?""

""My ex doesn't know Brad."" 

Dennis probably noticed the smirk flash across Sam's face. If he did, he chose to ignore it because he simply didn't have time to command respect. If he didn't, it was because he had too many other things to keep track of, and you should just give him a break.

""We're so short this week."" A load-bearing strip of invisible tape curled up, which Dennis smoothed down as he spoke. ""Wouldn't you be safer here? He wouldn't be dumb enough to murder you in front of the customers, would he?""

""Are we really gonna have customers on Monday?"" She added that Jose wouldn't make a very reliable witness, either, since he'd been trying to set a new record for how high an eighteen-year-old can possibly be while earning less than minimum wage.

""Eyes up, Sam."" 

Here, Dennis employed the calm but firm approach he used whenever his son was pushing his buttons. 

""Put the phone away,"" he said. ""Listen.""

Sam shrugged and slid her phone on the desk. Slowly she scooped a lock of coarse hair out of her face and tucked it behind her ear, setting her big doe eyes directly on him. ""Besides, have you met Ryan? He's not too bright.""

""Call Brad. Ask if he wants Friday off. If he does, tell him to work Thursday. Got it?""

A notification chimed on Sam's phone. That was fast. 

""Nope,"" she said. ""He's meeting with his parole officer Thursday.""

""Brad has a parole officer?"" Dennis squinted. ""Brad, the Eagle Scout? What is it with this industry?"" 

He scratched the reddish-brown stubble under his chin. ""How about Esmerelda?""

""She has a funeral.""

""Another one?"" 

Dennis rubbed his eyes. In the past forty-eight hours, he'd had probably twelve hours of sleep, which may not sound too bad but you should realize they were mostly non-consecutive. It was his intention, therefore, to finally get a decent night's sleep that night. If he could only be so lucky.

""How come she never misses when she's scheduled even though her loved ones are always dying?"" Sam wondered. ""Like, seriously. I wouldn't be showing up if my cousin died.""

""You don't even know your cousin.""

""But still.""

Dennis spotted a waiter, or maybe a busboy, from across the kitchen. He called to him in kitchen cant, which is something like a cross between Spanglish, profanity, and, through sheer coincidence, a very specific dialect of Yiddish. In seconds, the boy lugged over a bin of silverware bathing in sanitizer. The boy, an abject professional, winked at Sam as Dennis intercepted the bin and plopped it down on the desk in front of his subordinate.

""Dominic, then,"" he suggested. ""He's always reliable.""

Sam leaned forward and fished through the bucket for a fork and knife while Dennis dropped a stack of napkins nearby. ""Didn't he get busted peeing in the soup?""

How could Dennis forget? He was the one who fired him, after all.

He would soon look at the schedule to find that he was woefully out of options, but not before the phone on the wall cried out with its annoying trill. Dennis wasted no time putting it out of its misery.

""Gino's, Dennis speaking."" 

He gritted his teeth.

""Yep.""

He bent backwards into a deep, disgruntled breath.

""Her boyfriend, huh?""

He glanced at Sam. He furrowed his brow, and his eyes fell on the exactly three sets of silverware Sam had rolled. Now that her boss was occupied, she could finally put some time into staring off into space and picking her nails.

""She's not here right now. No, I don't know where she is. I can take a message, if you'd like.""

He bit his lip.

""Sure. I'll tell her. Bye bye!""

He hung up the antique phone with delicate restraint. ""We gotta block that number,"" he muttered. 

""Oh, and that was Ryan. He said he's gonna gut you.""

Sam pursed her lips and nodded.

Dennis was now twisting his face at the schedule. If he was trying to work a hex on it, it wasn't working. He sighed for the fiftieth time and slowly turned to Sam, who was now struggling to pop a zit with the aid of her pocket mirror. A sight that Dennis pretended not to see.

 ""Speaking of which, did you get that restraining order filed?""

""I'm almost done with the application. I was gonna finish last night but my brother came over unannounced. There was some wrestling match he wanted to watch. It's hard to concentrate with that going on.""

""Is he still looking for a job?"" Dennis asked.

""Not anymore. He's just started at Batteries Galore."" She rolled her eyes, lowered her voice to a murmur. ""Same place Ryan used to work.""

Dennis considered for a moment. ""I could hire him. Of course, I'd have to keep your schedules separate.""

Sam was watching an ad on her phone. ""Oh, that game looks easy,"" she said. ""Bet I could do that.""

""Nah, that would be a whole thing with HR.""

""Shit, I hope he doesn't really do it."" Sam was looking right through the wall across from her. ""I'm still not caught up on Carbuncle Queens."" Her eyes darted up to Dennis. ""You should watch that, dude. It's hilarious.""

""I don't watch reality sh—Ugh, you know what, nevermind."" He checked his watch. Quarter to five. ""Listen, Sam. The dinner rush is coming up."" He returned Sam's glare with his best negotiating face on. ""I need you now more than I do on Thursday. I'll let you have Thursday off if you stick around tonight.""

""You'll let me have Thursday off anyway, so I can stick around on Earth.""

""Sure,"" said Dennis. He was finally defeated. ""You're right. Take the evening off. And lay low on Monday. I'll see you—"" he glanced at the schedule again ""—Wednesday.""

Sam shot up from the table, then scrambled to set the metal chair back on its feet after it fell over with a graceless clatter. She turned, hesitated. Turned back to Dennis again, hands on the strings of her apron. ""Need this?""

""No thanks. I've got one of my own.""

She was out before anyone could protest, leaving Dennis alone to reflect on the insurmountable labors he had ahead of him.

He would be juggling his usual duties of whole house management with the grunt work of table service on a busy Saturday night. Between the cross-outs on the schedule, there were only three other names, and two of them belonged to rookies, so he'd be kept busy with six or seven tables all evening long. He knew he'd be working well past midnight wrapping everything up. 

Another night he'd come home to a sleeping family. 

Long ago, Dennis used to leave five minutes after closing time. ""Hold the fort down, folks!"" he'd say. Then, he'd go home to watch a movie with his wife and kid. Those were the days. 

The phone rang again. 

""Gino's, Dennis speaking."" 

It wasn't good news.  
  
  


**1**



It took Richard and Stella roughly a third of their life to pay off their house. Unlike many people, they decided to keep living in it, even though they could afford another mortgage if they wanted one. Stubbornness helped them pay off the house, and it was the same stubbornness that kept them here. What better reason would anyone have to live in Eagle City, Idaho?

This is an earnest question.

The house was nothing like one of those trussed-up bungalows you might see in the magazines, but it had its charm. The front door, Stella would have you know, was painted blue. The porch had a handsome wrought-iron safety fence going around it, which did an excellent job of keeping the inhabitants from spontaneously hurling themselves off the edge, which would probably result in a busted knee or broken hip. A paved path ran from the steps of the porch to the street. A stray golden retriever just recently left a steaming pile directly on that path.

Richard exploded from the blue door, obnoxiously whistling, on his way to check the mail. His head swiveled left and right as he walked, to see if any neighbors needed waving at. He checked his watch, but he should have checked the ground instead, as a careless step painted one of his New Balance sneakers brown.

The second time he emerged from the house, he was wearing flip flops. He'd have to be more careful, especially with the limited protection they offered, but he'd rather put more wear and tear on the washing machine and use up thirty gallons of water than subject himself to the stink long enough to clean the shoe himself.

More importantly, he was on a mission.

He made his way to the corner of Huckabee and Root and planted his folding lawn chair, taking his post. As with any Tuesday morning, he would spend the next few hours there, watching that portion of the neighborhood through amber-tinted sunglasses over a bulbous nose stained white with zinc.

In the cupholder was a stainless steel tumbler filled with coffee. On the lap of his khaki cargo shorts was a spiral-bound grid-lined notebook. At arm's length on the pavement to his left was a megaphone he'd borrowed from a neighbor who had brought it to a little league game once and had very soon regretted the decision. In his right hand was the most important piece of equipment of all, the prized thrift store find that had inspired this project months ago: the gently used radar gun, formerly the property of the Eagle City Police Department, sold by the Good Deal Thrift Emporium & Tanning Salon for only $10.

Richard never realized it, but the odds of such a thrift store treasure haul are about one in a million. You're more likely to find an heirloom frying pan with a bit of rust that someone thought ruined it after a trip in the dishwasher. If you ever do, just know that all you need is a bit of baking soda and some steel wool, and you'll end up with likely the best piece of cookware you've ever owned.

Anyway, this was a fairly slow morning. Richard sat on the edge of his seat with his speed gun armed and ready for nearly an hour before his first catch. Even then, it was one of those three-wheeled recreational vehicles, the recumbent bicycle equivalent of a car, and it was only going a few over, so Richard had a whispered argument with himself over whether to even write it down before deciding that he would, with a question mark in the margin.

It was another five minutes before a redheaded woman walking a short-legged dog emerged from one of the junctions connecting the avenue to numerous charming anonymous cul-de-sacs. She and her dog were both strangers to him. As she strode onward, the tottering Scottish terrier strangled on its own collar every three or four paces.

Now of course, there is no established speed limit for walking; that would be preposterous. Surely, Richard knew this. However, it didn't stop him from clocking the woman at 3.7 miles per hour. No wonder the canine was having such a hard time keeping the pace. The woman was walking like she had somewhere to be.

Richard took a ponderous sip of his black, unsweetened, decaf coffee, never taking his eyes off the road, and punctuated it with a breath of satisfaction. He lowered the tumbler, fiddling to ensure the cupholder's secure reception, and watched as a red Cadillac lurched up over the hill on Huckabee, shaking and rattling as it passed. He glanced at the radar gun: 43 miles per hour. In a 35. 

Richard shot up and raised the megaphone to his lips. ""Slow down, assclown!""

He initiated a trade with the pavement—the megaphone for the notebook—and sank back into the lawn chair, ready to jot down whatever details he saw fit. This included the make and model, the estimated year, the license plate number, and the recorded speed, as well as additional notes on the appearance of the vehicle, in many cases the wear and tear that was so common among recklessly-driven vehicles.

The roar of the engine faded back into the soothing sounds of wind rustling in the treetops, birdsong filling the air, and, suddenly, the incredibly agonizing default ringtone of a Motorola cell phone.

He had Stella on the phone now. A smile cracked across his face as he heard her voice.

""I've already caught two,"" he told her. 

With great enthusiasm he went on about all the little observations he'd made from the top of his morning to his first recording, between that and his most recent catch. On occasion Stella would break in with a ""make sure you're getting in your stretches"" and a ""don't forget to pick up milk on your way back.""

""But really, Stella, you should have seen that jackass I clocked yesterday. Guy flipped me off, if you can believe it. Damned ugly thing. The car, I mean. One of those big damn trucks where they get the body lifted up. Like they got something to compensate for, you know? Blowing 60 around that spot where Huckabee curves. The same spot where—""

The sudden verbal assault of a small-to-medium-sized dog absolutely derailed him. 

""Sounds like you have yourself a visitor,"" said Stella.

The redheaded woman from earlier had now made it to the end of Huckabee and had darted through the crosswalk parallel to Root Street. She rambled a thousand apologies as Richard was getting mauled—or perhaps better to say mounted—by this creature named Finch. The fast walker spewed assurances that Finch normally wasn't like this. Richard was liable to bruise as the unfortunately-named animal shifted on his hind legs, his forepaws firmly planted on the man's lap.

Richard was unbothered. His Midwest accent snapped into a caricature of a Scottish lilt as he gleefully rubbed the pooch behind the ears. “You're a feisty lad, aren't ya now?”

The avalanche of apologies and apologetics abated.

Moments later, Richard was able to continue with no less dignity, though with far more dog hair on his shorts. ""City council meets next week. I might just have enough data by then. At that point, it's on their conscience.""

""Just remember to be home by noon,"" said Stella. ""I've got plans for us, Richard.""

""Oh, plans, huh?"" Richard snorted. ""Michael had plans, too."" His eyes were set on that curve in the road. The vein on the right side of his forehead throbbed. ""He was just a boy, damn it."" 

All Stella could do now was listen.

""Used to be, you could ride a bike in this neighborhood. Or, you know, skate? Ride a scooter? Whatever, the point is, you could be safe. You didn't have to worry that a van would come barrelling around the bend, and mow you down.""

""Like what happened with Michael,"" said Stella.

""Exactly. Like what happened with Michael."" The hair stood up on the back of his neck. ""It isn't fair, you know. How someone could crash into a human being and just keep going.""

""I know,"" said Stella.

""I still see it, you know. What was left of him. I could barely tell it was him. The blood and whatever else…smeared on the asphalt. I stepped in it, Stel."" A fly landed on Richard's nose. He waggled his hand furiously to shoo it away. ""Michael was everywhere, and I stepped in it.""

""I know,"" said Stella. ""We had to throw away your shoes.""

""Yeah. And what a shame, too. Those were my good shoes.""

""Well,"" said Stella. ""There was just no cleaning that out.""

""It was all happening so fast,"" he said after a long pause. ""I guess I wasn't looking where I was going.""

""Neither was the driver.""

The dog walker, now several yards away, turned back to see if Richard was dying, his uproarious laughter came so suddenly. He caught his breath as he watched a bird of prey soar overhead. He could hear cars passing in the distance, but for the moment, the traffic through his neighborhood hit a lull. He shook off the cobwebs. 

""Alright, you got it. I'll see you at noon.""

1 or 1,5 year ago I found this genre and I found a 1 hour mix with all of the songs being awsome. I found it on youtube.

Now the thing is, I can not find it anymore. Maybe the mixtape violated something. I have tried AI to find it, it helped me to use ways I would not know normally, like specified google search or downloading my youtube history, but none of them worked.

I would like to ask for help here, maybe someone knows the mixtape or at least the playlist. 

Some help I gathered so far:

\- Title was mentioning BLACK COFFEE and also he was on the picture. 

\- The first song was: ANOTR, Abel Barder - Relax my eyes (Mr. Moudz afro house remix)

\- I know another song from the middle of the mixtape: Florence & the machine - Spectrum (Say my name) \[Marco Generani remix\]

\- There was a link with the playlist in the description, but sadly can’t remember the site name

That’s all I got, I don’t really hope for nothing but I give this a shot. 

Thanks if you read it.

34 year old guy in Michigan looking to connect with someone who is confidently childfree and actually wants that lifestyle long term.

I live a pretty balanced life. In the warmer months I’m usually outside hiking, grilling, on the water, or finding random adventures. When winter hits I switch into reading, binge watching shows, good coffee, and staying warm indoors mode. Hybrid job with weird hours but flexible, so I can travel or plan mid week escapes.

5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, brown hair. Non smoker, social drinker, no drugs.

Personality wise I’m laid back, sarcastic once comfortable, and big on consistency. I like real conversations that can bounce from ridiculous to deep without warning. Physical touch is definitely my love language.

Looking for someone who:
• Is truly childfree by choice
• Wants a real connection, not pen pals
• Has a sense of humor
• Values communication

Open to friendship that builds into more. If you’re in Michigan even better, but not required.

1r87g73,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1r87g73/a_huge_guide_with_all_the_study_tips_i_find_useful/,A HUGE guide with all the study tips I find useful,"
I am a redditor for more than a year, and I actually have a long study journey, but still there are moments when my regular tips don`t work or when I simply need something new for my routine. 

So I have really read a lot of reddit threads, articles, comments and have come up with a very huge, but really useful guide with all study tips I personally find useful. 

       1. Time Management & planning

Set daily goals – even small ones, like 2–3 hours; consistency > cramming.

Block scheduling – plan your day/week with assignments, classes, and breaks.

Prioritize tough tasks first – your brain is freshest in the morning or after breaks.

Front-load planning – spend 1 day planning your semester to free mental energy.

Use timers – Pomodoro (25/5 or 50/10) or custom intervals to keep focus.



         2. Study Environment

Dedicated space – library, quiet café, or a tidy corner at home.


Comfort & accessibility – water, snacks, comfortable seating, good lighting.


Change locations – can improve focus and memory (contextual cues).


Social pressure – studying where others study silently can motivate.



         3. Tools & techniques

Active recall – flashcards, quizzes, writing notes by hand, summarizing.


Spaced repetition 


Teaching method – explain concepts to yourself or someone else.


Study structure – Research, Question, Read, Recite, Record, Review.



          4. Focus & motivation

Limit phone/social media – put it away, use apps that block distractions.


Visual motivation – studyspo boards, quotes, or checklists.


Reward system – breaks, snacks, coffee, or scheduled free time.



           5. Lifestyle & health

Sleep – don’t pull all-nighters; rest boosts memory and focus.


Hydration & nutrition – water, healthy snacks, moderate caffeine.


Exercise – short walks, squats, or stretching help focus and circulation.


Short power naps – if tired, 10–15 min naps can refresh your brain.



         6. Studying when tired / unmotivated

Do lighter tasks or quick reviews instead of intense study.


Move or change environment to reset focus.


Start with just 1 study session – momentum often builds naturally.


Break big tasks into small, actionable steps.


           7. Other practical tips

Highlight → handwritten notes → typed notes – helps reinforce memory.


Reward yourself with days off – like “3 hrs/day study = Sunday off.”


Snacks / tea / coffee – keep nearby, but avoid overdoing caffeine.


Mindfulness / meditation – clear your head before studying.",1,1771431709.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False

She had only ever been told she’s “meeting expectations” and that she’ll be rewarded ""eventually.""

Prime example — when she got extremely sick after time off, her manager’s first reaction was to ask her if she could still lead a meeting and catch up on hours (when she was IN THE ER !!!!) Another manager once called her a ""f\*cking idiot,"" and when she put her notice in, there were no thank-yous AT ALL for her 3 years of work.

ANYWAYS, she quit! She took a small pay bump, joined a new company, and, despite not being remote anymore, she loves it. Her office has free snacks, a free coffee bar, a daily lunch stipend, and regular happy hour activities. Her manager has to REMIND her to stop working and that it's fine to leave early or do what she needs to do. They praise good work and the culture of negativity that she experienced from her Big 4 company literally does not exist there.

I haven't seen her so happy about work in a long time. All this to say, Big 4 is not the norm. There are great workplaces out there that actually make you feel like you're important and valued.

I’m running Meta ads for a client (my agency IG Influence Hannover) and would love some advice from people who’ve tested this a lot.

Context:
My client owns an aesthetically high-end, “hipster” café in Austria — very Copenhagen / Scandinavian coffee shop vibe. They already have a strong IG presence with 20k+ followers, good content quality, and some posts historically generated a lot of followers and engagement organically.

Goal:
Mainly to gain more relevant followers (ideally people who might actually visit), and secondarily local brand awareness.

My initial plan:
Boost / promote the posts that already performed best organically (high follower growth + engagement), because they seem “proven.”

Questions:
	1.	Is it generally smarter to “boost/promote” those exact posts (so the ad shows the same post with the existing likes/comments/social proof),
or should I build ads in Ads Manager and use those posts as creatives (same visuals, but not necessarily the same post ID)?
	2.	For follower growth + awareness: do you usually optimize for Engagement, Video Views, Reach, or Traffic to IG profile (if using placements that allow it)?
I’m aware “followers” isn’t a direct conversion event in Meta, so curious what people have found actually correlates best with real follower increases.
	3.	Audiences:
	•	How useful are Custom Audiences like Instagram account engagers, video viewers, and profile visitors for this kind of local business?
	•	Any best practice on retargeting windows (7 days vs 30 vs 90) for cafés/restaurants?
	4.	Lookalikes:
Do you find Lookalikes of IG engagers/profile visitors helpful for local businesses, or do they get too broad / less “visit-intent”?
If you use lookalikes, what’s your typical setup (1%, 2–3%, stacked, etc.) — and do you restrict them with geo radius around the café?
	5.	Any “don’t do this” pitfalls when the brand already has 20k followers?
(e.g., promoting viral posts that attract tourists/out-of-country followers, etc.)

If anyone has a tested framework for cafés / restaurants (especially in Europe), I’d really appreciate it. Happy to share results once we run it.

Thanks!

I just wonder if it just was a mismatch with a ""spark"" or I was a little bit intense. 

We met at a social event & we exchanged numbers. I decided to ask her out & she agreed. We went to a buffet & really hit it off, we talked for literal hours. Even when we had arrived back at her place to drop her off we decided to go for a walk around her neighborhood for a little while & when again I was getting ready to say goodbye we ended up at a coffee shop instead. In the end we talked about 6 hours in all. 

Obviously we decided to go on a couple more subsequent dates & those were pretty great too, talked about all matter of subjects; what we want in a relationship, what we're looking for in a life partner & all that good stuff. 

On the surface it seemed great, so what went wrong? 

She had said from the beginning that she wanted to take things slowly, she had recently ended another long-term relationship with someone else a few months ago (it lasted 5 years) & she wasn't quite looking for a serious relationship but was willing to give it a shot (in hindsight this should've been a red flag, but she seemed great so I disregarded it), she just wanted to take things slow. No problem on my end, she was very sweet, courteous & when I hugged her for the first time I definitely felt a strong emotional connection.   
  
The thing is, I didn't realize this would mean she would be unwilling to allow me to help her. It wasn't anything crazy, relatively small things, helping her clean, sort out problems with her car, lending her things (cleaning supplies, tools, etc), relatively harmless things. She rejected it all in the guise that it was too soon & we're in a very early stage of the relationship. Which I guess was valid, however, between that & being unable to text or see each other regularly (our dates were spread out over several weeks) bc of her busy work life it put a strain on my side.   
  
I believe I could've also managed things better, but I just felt like I wasn't getting what I needed & I guess from her side I was overly eager & ""too much"".   
  
I guess an outside perspective on this would help me analyze this from other viewpoints that I may have failed to also consider.   
  
  
Some other context:   
  
She had gone through many relatively short & meaningless relationships. By her own description they were a drag on her & hardly contributed toward the relationship & In some cases she felt disrespected. She had said at the time that I fit the description of what she had always been telling herself she wanted but never pursued.  
  
We almost hooked up on our second date, but I kept it from happening to respect her wish to wait & take things slow. I felt the most connected to her on that second date but seemingly that's where things started to go downhill. 

It felt as if she wouldn't let herself go & allow me to care or love for her. ",1,1771431612.0,dating,7,1.0,False
1r87e8i,https://i.redd.it/fx275qrl3akg1.jpeg,5 years later… iPhone 12 retired. 17 Pro reporting for duty.,"I was honestly super skeptical before buying this. My dads old iPhone 12 was still working fine and I kept telling myself an upgrade wasn’t really “necessary.” I went back and forth for weeks, comparing features, prices, and even stressing about the whole payment situation. After all that Dubai payment planning and currency confusion, I almost dropped the idea completely.

Then mummy said, “If you like it, go ahead and get it.” That simple push removed all the hesitation.

Now that it’s here… I get the hype. The performance jump is instantly noticeable, the display feels smoother, and the camera upgrade alone makes it feel like a different league. It’s one of those upgrades you don’t realize you needed until you actually use it.

Also feels good upgrading after a full 5-year run — proper value extracted from the 12. No impulse buy, just patience finally paying off.

Set it up on my desk with my usual coffee ritual and it genuinely felt like a small life upgrade moment.

Neuroscience backs up: that obsessive, *world-revolves-around-you* feeling has a shelf life. Somewhere between 18 months and 3 years, your brain stops producing the chemicals that make another person feel like oxygen. And here you are standing in the kitchen making coffee for two, wondering: *Is this it?*

While many view this as a crisis, it is, in fact, the real starting line for a lasting relationship.

**^(1. Passion → 2. Disillusionment → 3. The Choice → 4. Maturity)**

That third stage is where people bail. Because disillusionment is brutal: you start actually seeing them, their annoying habits. Feeling a disconnect between who you imagined them to be and who they are is inevitable.

And here's the hard part: you cannot change another person. 

So you're left with a choice nobody romanticizes: **accept reality or leave it**. Peace doesn't come from fixing your partner. It comes from making peace with the gap between your expectations and reality.

Figured the audience here may be interested.  I am sorry that this is so long, but it is challenging to be concise given the complexity of the journey.  I do not consider myself an expert - at anything.  But have learned from the experience and from the knowledge of my team.  Happy to answer any questions I may be able to based on that experience.*

There's a particular kind of confidence that comes from reading your fifth whitepaper on enterprise AI adoption. You start to believe you understand the landscape. You sketch architectures on whiteboards. You use phrases like ""operationalize"" and ""at scale"" in meetings.

Then you actually try to do it.

I lead a team that has stood up enterprise AI enablement services in a large organization. We serve tens of thousands of users, carry significant regulatory obligations, and operate inside the kind of institutional complexity that makes ""move fast and break things"" sound less like a philosophy and more like a termination offense. Over the past several years, my team has built an enterprise AI program essentially from scratch. We've shipped real capabilities to real users. We've also made mistakes that, in hindsight, seem almost comically avoidable.

This is the story of that journey. Not the sanitized version you'd find in a vendor case study, but the real one. If you're an enterprise leader standing up your own AI capabilities, I hope our experience saves you at least a few headaches.

# Before the Revolution: When ""AI"" Meant Regressions and Random Forests

Long before ChatGPT became a household name, we were already running machine learning workloads. But to understand where AI fits into our story, you need to understand what our office actually does. We manage a centralized data platform with a suite of analytics and business intelligence tools built around it: Tableau for visualization, Alteryx for data preparation and workflows, ArcGIS for geospatial analysis, and Palantir Foundry for large-scale data integration and operational analytics. Together, these form an enterprise data and analytics platform that serves the entire organization.

So when machine learning started gaining traction, our office was a natural home for it. The problem was that plenty of teams across the organization had already figured that out on their own. Research enclaves were popping up everywhere. Individual offices were spinning up their own virtual machines, installing their own tools, running their own analyses. And many of them were doing good work. That made our job harder, not easier.

At the enterprise level, we hosted JupyterHub on an EMR cluster. It worked, but we struggled with package and kernel management, and the cost efficiency wasn't great. Over time, we've been working to migrate our Jupyter users to Notebooks on SageMaker, which has been a much better fit.

But the real challenge in those early days wasn't technical. It was credibility. When you're trying to centralize a capability that dispersed teams are already doing successfully on their own, you can't just show up and tell them to stop. You have to deliver something better. Our pitch was that enterprise management offered things they couldn't easily replicate in isolation: easy access to governed data, top-down governance and compliance, cost savings from economy of scale, and communities of practice where data scientists across the organization could actually learn from each other. It was a compelling case, but only as long as we could back it up with execution.

We're still earning that trust. But the foundation we built during this period, the relationships with those dispersed teams, the credibility we accumulated by actually delivering, gave us a significant head start when generative AI changed everything.

# ""Can We Get a ChatGPT?"": The Generative AI Moment

Like every other large organization on the planet, we got *the question* almost immediately. Leadership wanted to know what generative AI could do for us. Individual teams were already experimenting with consumer tools in ways that kept our security team up at night. The pressure to deliver something, anything, was real.

Our answer was an internal AI assistant built on OpenAI models hosted through Microsoft Azure. Simple enough in concept. Considerably less simple in execution.

What followed was weeks of unglamorous but essential work: hardening the security boundary, protecting endpoints, standing up virtual networks, configuring certificates, registering domains. This is not the kind of work that makes it into keynote presentations, but without it, nothing else was possible. We were building a secure front door before we could invite anyone inside.

Looking back, I wish I'd allocated twice the time we originally estimated for this phase. Security architecture at enterprise scale isn't something you can shortcut, and every corner we considered cutting would have come back to haunt us.

But we got it done. And we got it done early. To my knowledge, we delivered a secure, internal ChatGPT-like service before any comparable organization had. I want to be clear: it wasn't glamorous. There was no file upload. No multi-modal capability. It ran on an older model. But it worked. It was secure. And it opened the eyes of a workforce that had been hearing about generative AI in the news but hadn't been able to touch it in a sanctioned environment.

The response was overwhelming. Our ""AI Assistant"" became one of the most talked-about services we'd ever launched. Not because it was cutting-edge, but because it was *available*. For tens of thousands of users who had been told ""don't use ChatGPT at work,"" we had finally given them something they could use. That mattered more than any feature list.

# The Chatbot Cambrian Explosion

Once we had a working AI assistant, we turned our attention to what was, at the time, the most requested capability: Retrieval-Augmented Generation. RAG chatbots. The ability to point a language model at your own data and have a conversation with it.

First, we had to educate. Most of our users had never heard the term ""RAG,"" and frankly, many of them didn't need to. What they needed to understand was the art of the possible: that they could take a library of policy documents, technical manuals, or operational guides and make them conversationally searchable.

The demand was immediate and overwhelming.

Our first RAG chatbot was a custom LangChain application running on a virtual machine. It worked well enough as a proof of concept, but custom coding a new chatbot for every request was not scalable for a small team. So we got creative. We developed a framework that allowed us to deliver the same RAG environment to different users, managing access through Active Directory rather than building new solutions from scratch each time. We built a ticketing workflow to intake requests and streamlined provisioning so we could stand up new instances quickly.

And then the chatbots proliferated. Every division wanted one. Every program office saw a use case. We went from a handful to dozens in what felt like no time at all. Eventually, even our framework couldn't keep up with the volume. That pressure is a big part of what drove our eventual migration to SimpleChat, a self-service platform I'll get into later in this article.

Somewhere in the middle of all this, we had two ideas that I'm still a little embarrassed never materialized. The first was an index of chatbots, a central registry so users could discover what already existed before requesting something new. The second, even more ambitious, was a chatbot *of* chatbots: a meta-assistant that could route queries to the right specialized bot.

Both were good ideas. Neither was implemented. The pace of the underlying technology was shifting so fast that our roadmap kept getting rewritten before we could execute on it. I suspect many enterprise AI teams will recognize that pattern. The planning horizon for generative AI capabilities is brutally short. What seemed like a six-month initiative in January was often obsolete by June.

# The Policy Problem Nobody Wants to Talk About

Here's something that doesn't get enough attention in enterprise AI discussions: the policy gap.

When generative AI arrived, most organizations, including ours, didn't have policies that addressed it. Existing data governance frameworks weren't designed for a technology that could ingest, synthesize, and generate text at scale. We recognized early that we needed to move on two fronts simultaneously: deploying technology and establishing the rules of engagement.

We authored our organization's AI Strategy early in the generative AI wave, early enough that we were genuinely proud of the timing. We followed it with specific policy on the use of generative AI tools: what was authorized, what wasn't, and under what conditions.

And then came the confusion.

Despite our best efforts at communication, users struggled to understand what they were and weren't allowed to do. The boundaries weren't always intuitive. Was a particular third-party tool authorized? Could they paste sensitive data into an approved platform? What about a tool that was authorized for one use case but not another?

We learned an important lesson here: you cannot depend solely on policy and rules of system use as your governance mechanism. Policy is necessary, absolutely, but in a world where AI capabilities are embedded into a constantly expanding set of tools, you need technological guardrails too. The problem is that those guardrails can't be everywhere. You can't put a filter on every application, every browser extension, every API call. So you end up with a hybrid approach where policy sets the boundaries, technology enforces what it can, and education fills the gaps.

It's imperfect. We're still refining it. But I think any enterprise leader who tells you they've solved AI governance is either operating at a much smaller scale than they're letting on or isn't looking closely enough.

# The Bureaucracy That Keeps You Safe (Even When It Doesn't Feel Like It)

I'll be honest: there were days when I resented the compliance process. Privacy threshold assessments. Security impact analyses. Authority to operate reviews. Each one felt like another weight on a team that was already sprinting.

But over time I've come to appreciate that these controls exist for good reason. When you're deploying AI capabilities to tens of thousands of users, the blast radius of a data exposure or a poorly governed model isn't theoretical. It's a front-page story.

One of the most impactful things we did was integrate with our organization's software review board. We positioned our team as a service to the entire enterprise: every software request that included an AI capability came through us for data control review. This wasn't about being gatekeepers. It was about making sure the people making procurement and deployment decisions had a clear picture of how each tool handled data, where it went, who could access it, and what happened to it after the session ended.

It wasn't always a popular role to play. But it was necessary.

# Where We Are Now: Bedrock, Agents, and the Long Game

Today, our program looks dramatically different from where we started. We've migrated much of our infrastructure to AWS, with Bedrock as the backbone for our most sophisticated AI capabilities. We're supporting multi-agent architectures that are *nearly* autonomous. I say ""nearly"" because we maintain essential zero-trust and human-in-the-loop requirements. Full autonomy in our environment isn't just inadvisable. It's not an option.

Getting here required far more behind-the-scenes technical coordination than I expected, and this is probably my single biggest lesson learned.

# The Infrastructure Iceberg

When I first took on this role, I was relatively unfamiliar with the broader IT organization in which my division resided. My instinct was to configure all of the underlying infrastructure with my own team: IAM roles, service permissions, network configurations. We were capable and motivated. We were also, it turns out, deeply naive about what ""enterprise scale"" actually means.

Standing up AWS services like SageMaker and Bedrock for one or two users is a fundamentally different challenge than doing it for tens and hundreds of teams, many with massive compute and throughput requirements. The IAM role configurations alone took weeks to perfect. Cost guardrails had to be architected so that individual teams couldn't accidentally spin up resources that blew through budgets. Even the intake workflow, how teams requested access, how accounts were provisioned, how governance was applied, required its own dedicated engineering effort.

Over time, we did what we should have done from the beginning: we became close partners with our organization's cloud services team. They had the expertise, the access, and the institutional knowledge that we lacked. This collaboration transformed our delivery capability. What had been a bottleneck became a pipeline.

If I could go back and change one thing, it would be this. I would have walked down the hall and started that partnership on day one.

# The AI Use-Case Lifecycle

One of our most important innovations has been the development of a formal AI use-case lifecycle. We noticed a pattern early on: teams would get excited about AI, build a prototype, demo it to enthusiastic stakeholders, and then... nothing. The prototype would languish. It would never make it to production. The excitement would fade, and the investment would be wasted.

So we built a structured process to carry use cases from spark to sustainment. It starts with ideation and requirements gathering, where our team works alongside use-case developers to refine their concept and ensure it's viable. From there, we provision technical resources, provide technical consultancy, and assist with data preparation and governance alignment.

Development, testing, and validation follow, and we stay engaged through the entire arc. System rollout and transition to sustainment aren't afterthoughts. They're planned phases with defined handoffs. Post-deployment, we monitor model health, schedule retraining cycles, and track performance against the metrics that justified the use case in the first place.

This lifecycle changed how we operate. It's the difference between an organization that *experiments* with AI and one that actually *runs* on it.

# From Internal Assistant to Self-Service

Our tooling has evolved as well. We've migrated from our original internal AI assistant to utilizing the open-source ""[Simple Chat](https://github.com/microsoft/simplechat),"" a platform that gives users self-service RAG capabilities, community workspaces, and a more flexible interaction model. The shift from centrally managed chatbots to user-empowered workspaces reflects something we took a while to internalize: our job isn't to build every AI solution ourselves. It's to provide the platform, the guardrails, and the expertise so that domain experts across the organization can build their own.

We're also running pilot programs with AI-enabled coding platforms like GitHub Copilot, Replit, and Claude Code, and exploring the Google Workspace AI integrations. Each of these requires its own governance review, its own security assessment, and its own change management effort. The work doesn't stop.

# What I'd Tell You Over Coffee

If you're an enterprise leader early in your AI journey, here's what I'd want you to know.

The infrastructure is the iceberg. The AI models are the visible tip. Below the waterline is identity management, network security, cost governance, intake workflows, provisioning automation, and a dozen other things that nobody writes Medium articles about. Budget for them. Staff for them. Respect them.

Partner early with your infrastructure teams. Don't try to build it all yourself. The cloud services team, the network team, the identity team: they're not obstacles. The sooner you integrate with them, the faster you'll move.

Policy alone won't save you. You need policy and technology and education working together. Any one of those by itself is insufficient.

Build the lifecycle, not just the prototype. Anyone can demo an AI chatbot. The hard part is getting it to production, keeping it healthy, and making sure it delivers sustained value. If you don't have a structured path from ideation to sustainment, you're going to end up with a graveyard of proofs of concept.

Embrace the bureaucracy. Push to make it faster and better calibrated to the technology, sure. But don't try to skip it. The controls exist because the risks are real, and at enterprise scale, the consequences of getting it wrong are significant.

And stay humble. The technology is moving faster than any of us can fully track. The strategy you write today will need to be revised in six months. The architecture you're proud of right now will feel dated in a year. That's not failure. That's the nature of the work.

We're still learning. Every week brings something we hadn't anticipated. But we're learning from a position of operational maturity that we built through years of work that was rarely glamorous and almost never easy.

So I have really read a lot of reddit threads, articles, comments and have come up with a very huge, but really useful guide with all study tips I personally find useful. 

1. Time Management & planning

Set daily goals – even small ones, like 2–3 hours; consistency > cramming.

Block scheduling – plan your day/week with assignments, classes, and breaks.

Prioritize tough tasks first – your brain is freshest in the morning or after breaks.

Front-load planning – spend 1 day planning your semester to free mental energy.

Use timers – Pomodoro (25/5 or 50/10) or custom intervals to keep focus.



2. Study Environment

Dedicated space – library, quiet café, or a tidy corner at home.

Comfort & accessibility – water, snacks, comfortable seating, good lighting.

Change locations – can improve focus and memory (contextual cues).

Social pressure – studying where others study silently can motivate.



3. Tools & techniques

Active recall – flashcards, quizzes, writing notes by hand, summarizing.

Spaced repetition – flashcards or mind maps for memorization.

Teaching method – explain concepts to yourself or someone else.

SQ4R method – Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Record, Review.



4. Focus & motivation

Limit phone/social media – put it away, use apps that block distractions.

Music / noise – classical, lofi, brown/grey noise, or a single repeated song.

Visual motivation – studyspo boards, quotes, or checklists.

Reward system – breaks, snacks, coffee, or scheduled free time (avoid addictive rewards).



5. Lifestyle & health

Sleep – don’t pull all-nighters; rest boosts memory and focus.

Hydration & nutrition – water, healthy snacks, moderate caffeine.

Exercise – short walks, squats, or stretching help focus and circulation.

Short power naps – if tired, 10–15 min naps can refresh your brain.



6. Studying when tired / unmotivated

Do lighter tasks or quick reviews instead of intense study.

Move or change environment to reset focus.

Start with just 1 Pomodoro session – momentum often builds naturally.

Break big tasks into small, actionable steps.


7. Other practical tips

Highlight → handwritten notes → typed notes – helps reinforce memory.

Reward yourself with days off – like “3 hrs/day study = Sunday off.”

Snacks / tea / coffee – keep nearby, but avoid overdoing caffeine.

Mindfulness / meditation – clear your head before studying.",2,1771431330.0,BackToClass,0,1.0,False

We've chatted a couple times about different things like his coffee machine, pricing - why their products aren't that expensive despite the quality being top-tier, and his bread-making process.

Anyhow, the reports circulating about him has been very depressing the past few days. I've decided to just mute his name on Facebook. I'll look here on Reddit instead for updates. I'm hoping and praying that he gets the justice he deserves.

The biggest reason for this trip is to watch the Timbers take on the Crew (Go Crew!!!!)⚽ but we’ll be in town through Wednesday and can’t wait to explore. We’ve been doing our own research on things to do, but I wanted to ask the locals for some fun recommendations too!

We travel a lot and usually love starting our day by walking out of the hotel and just seeing where it takes us. We’re big coffee people and would love to support as many local coffee shops as we can while we’re there!

Any favorite spots, hidden gems, must-see neighborhoods, or can’t-miss experiences? We are staying at the Hilton in Downtown.

Thanks so much — we’re so excited to visit your city!",2,1771430837.0,askportland,15,0.57,False

1r870d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1r870d2/5_signs_a_woman_likes_you_but_is_trying_not_to/,5 Signs a Woman Likes You But Is Trying NOT to Show It (Science-Based),"So I've been studying attraction dynamics for the past few years through psychology research, evolutionary biology papers, and honestly way too many hours listening to experts like Matthew Hussey and Esther Perel break down human behavior. And there's this fascinating pattern I kept noticing: women often hide their interest even when they're genuinely attracted. Not because they're playing games, but because of legitimate psychological and social factors we rarely talk about.



\*\*Here's the thing most guys miss.\*\* Society has conditioned women to be the ""choosers"" not the ""pursuers."" There's real research backing this up from evolutionary psychology, showing women face way more social judgment for being too forward. Add in fear of rejection, past experiences, and the biological wiring that makes them assess compatibility more carefully, you get someone who's interested but cautiously testing the waters. The good news? Once you understand these signals, you can actually do something about it.



\*\*1. She's weirdly awkward around you specifically\*\*



If she's normally confident and articulate but suddenly becomes a different person when you're nearby, that's not random. Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett's work on emotional regulation explains this perfectly. When we're attracted to someone, our nervous system literally goes haywire. She might:



\- Avoid eye contact then steal glances when she thinks you're not looking

\- Laugh too hard at your mediocre jokes

\- Fumble with objects or stumble over words

\- Act slightly cold or dismissive as a defense mechanism



I remember reading ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer (former FBI behavioral analyst who literally wrote the book on reading people). He breaks down how humans unconsciously mirror defensive behaviors when we feel vulnerable. If she likes you but doesn't want to reveal it, awkwardness becomes her shield.



\*\*2. She remembers weirdly specific details about you\*\*



This one's subtle but powerful. She casually mentions something you said three weeks ago that you barely remember telling her. She asks about that project you mentioned once. She knows your coffee order without asking.



Matthew Hussey talks about this in his podcast ""Love Life"" constantly. When someone's interested, their brain literally prioritizes information about you. It's not neuroscience. The reticular activating system in our brain filters information, and guess what gets priority? Details about people we're attracted to.



If she's trying not to show interest, she might drop these references super casually like ""oh yeah I think you mentioned that before"" while internally she's catalogued everything you've ever said.



\*\*3. She finds reasons to be in your orbit without making it obvious\*\*



Pay attention to patterns. Does she suddenly need coffee at the exact time you take your break? Shows up at the same gym, same classes, same friend gatherings? 



This isn't coincidence. Robert Cialdini's research on proximity and attraction (documented in ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"") shows we develop feelings for people we're frequently around. She knows this instinctively.



The giveaway: she acts slightly surprised to see you every time, even though the pattern is consistent. That's her maintaining plausible deniability while maximizing contact.



\*\*4. Her friends act weird around you\*\*



Women tell their friends everything. If her crew suddenly seems overly interested in you, giggles when you approach, or makes excuses to leave you two alone, they're probably in on it.



There's also BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that pulls insights from research papers, expert interviews, and relationship psychology books to create personalized audio content. Built by a team from Columbia University and Google, it lets you customize depth and length based on what you need, from quick 10-minute overviews to detailed 40-minute deep dives. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on your goals, whether that's improving social skills or understanding attachment theory better. You can even ask its virtual coach specific questions about situations you're navigating in real time.



Another tell: her friends might test you with subtle questions or create scenarios where you interact more. They're her reconnaissance team.



\*\*5. She's hot and cold, but leans slightly warm\*\*



One day she's chatty and engaged, the next she's distant. But overall, there's a slight warmth underneath. This push pull dynamic isn't manipulation, it's internal conflict.



Esther Perel discusses this beautifully in ""Mating in Captivity."" When someone's attracted but uncertain (about timing, compatibility, their own readiness), they oscillate between moving closer and pulling back. It's like emotional risk management.



The difference between genuine disinterest and hidden interest? Consistency of the coldness. If she's truly not into you, she'll be consistently neutral or distant. If she likes you but won't show it, you'll see warmth peek through regularly even during ""cold"" phases.



\*\*The book that changed how I see all this: ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller.\*\* These psychiatrists break down attachment theory in relationships and honestly it's insanely good. Helped me understand why people who are interested sometimes act unavailable (spoiler: it's often their attachment style, not their actual feelings). The research is solid, the writing is accessible, and it'll make you question everything you thought you knew about attraction signals.



\*\*What actually matters here:\*\* these signs mean there's potential, but they're not a green light to just wait around hoping. If you're picking up on multiple signals, the move is to create safe opportunities for her to be more open. Lower stakes hangouts, genuine conversations, showing you're emotionally intelligent enough to handle whatever she's feeling.



The reality is that modern dating involves a lot of uncertainty for everyone. Biology, society, past experiences, and individual psychology all create this complicated dance. But once you understand the actual reasons behind these behaviors instead of just taking them at surface value, you can navigate it way better.



And look, sometimes you'll misread signals. That's fine. Part of being human is taking calculated risks and learning from them. What matters is approaching it with genuine interest in her as a person, not just decoding signals like you're cracking a safe.

Built around fingerstyle acoustic guitar and an intimate, breathy vocal, the song captures the subtle weight of parting: the untouched coffee, the stillness of a kitchen, and the gentle wind that carries what was almost said.

It’s not about the goodbye itself,
but the silence that follows.

1r86yuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosted/comments/1r86yuq/my_f50_friend_colleague_started_flirting_and/,My F50 friend colleague started flirting and finally ghosted me,"
I am a 46 year old man. For two years, I worked with a 50-year-old woman colleague who was four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We talked, went to lunch together or with other colleagues. She also brought me small homemade meals, because she knew that I liked to eat well. Sometimes she offered me cakes and snacks, a bit like a big sister, I thought. Sometimes she behaved childishly towards me, for example one day she ran up to me to talk to me, like a child, then she teased me during a discussion. Every time a meal was organized at work for a party, she insisted that I attend, because I don't like meetings with colleagues. Then she became colder and more distant. Sometimes she came and asked me to go out for lunch with her to do some shopping. She often suggested going out with the children, but I systematically refused, because I didn't want to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management, a kind of harassment that I took very badly. For several months, I didn't talk to anyone at work, focusing on my tasks and trying to get through this difficult time. This colleague asked why I was isolating myself, and I simply told her, “I have a lot of work,” without further explanation. One day, I met her by chance in the metro, and she came to see me, offering to travel together. She behaved in a way that I would describe as flirtatious (she came very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, leaned very close to talk to me). One day she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close to me. I didn't know how to react because she's older, and I was quite surprised.

I then found another job in another office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was and told me that she was inviting her to lunch that day. On the big day, she invited me over and asked me if she had done something wrong, why I didn't talk to her anymore. I explained to him that I had suffered harassment and that I had looked for another job, which I had found. Congratulated me warmly, praising the fact that I was ''comfortable in my job'', ''funny'' etc.She was relieved that my distant attitude didn't come from her. She then continued to make flirtatious gestures, like furtively touching my hand with her index finger while she was eating.

I then told him that since I was moving to another office, we could stay in touch and meet up for family outings with the kids and spouses (maybe that was a mistake on my part!). Delighted, seemed very excited when I contacted her offering to go out with the children, but I noticed that she did not notify her husband when we met. This is why I then suggested family outings with the spouses. She accepted and organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly. With our respective spouses. I thought our relationship was wonderful. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and I didn't warn her, she would point it out to me: “You didn't call me, that's not nice. » Yet, she did it on her own, but frankly, I didn't care. She offered small meals and snacks, prepared picnics. Still seemed very motivated. She also began to criticize her husband, saying that he doesn't get involved, that he just drinks coffee at home, and that he is old. When I asked her the context of their meeting, she told me that he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first, because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick, something her husband could have done. When her husband was present, her behavior changed. She was becoming silent, distant, not chatting as usual. We felt that she was distant from him. On the contrary, he seemed very in love.

She promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested that she come home with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day after an outing with her son and my son, without the spouses exceptionally, she said ""we'll meet at your place for the recipe. Ok, when I got home I thought we were going to chat over coffee or tea but she refused. She started cooking by herself, doing the dishes, without saying anything. Very weird. Then she says 'the meal is ready t, I have to go now'' Then she left the place without even having discussed. It was really, in my opinion, a strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family. I told her that I knew this country well and that I preferred Portugal. she then decided to go to Portugal with her family. I found it strange

She started by organizing outings herself with the two families, booking hotels, offering hikes. Barbecues and meals at home. Outings with children such as to the swimming pool etc. She even wanted our two families to go together to a foreign country, and to a chalet in the mountains. She also offered to organize a women's outing for her and my mother at a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several invitations to dinner at each other's houses, she stopped giving any news. All at once. She used to call to suggest immediate outings, etc. One day her husband had to help me assemble a piece of furniture, which had been planned for weeks, and on the big day, he gave me the wrong idea. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I came to pick him up in the car, he told me in the car during the ride ""if she wants to separate, no problem."" I did not understand this intervention.

Then, no more news....I wrote to her several times to find out if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent my New Year wishes to her husband, with no response. She promised to give me contacts of renovation companies, which she never did.

I then confronted her by text several months later, with no news... I asked her why we had disappeared and why she had not given me the promised information regarding the renovations. She wrote to me that she was on vacation. I wrote to him: “You two disappeared without giving us the promised contacts, you are profiteers”. Then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied something like, “A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,” and then concluded, “This is where our relationship ends.»

We game sometimes, grab coffee, complain about life, the usual. Lately though he’s been a little messy with money in a way that makes me uneasy. Not like he’s starving or anything, just weird stuff like borrowing from one friend, then “forgetting” to pay back until someone reminds him twice. A couple months ago he admitted he had some debts he was “handling” but he got defensive if anyone asked what that meant. I didn’t think it was my business, but I noticed a pattern of him always needing something urgently and always promising it will be fixed tomorrow.

Yesterday he messaged me out of nowhere like hey can you help me real quick, I just need to make one payment and my bank has limits, it’s super dumb. He said if I just send him my card details or let him use my card for this one payment, he’ll send me the money back the same day. I asked what the payment was for and he got kind of vague, like “it’s just a thing, don’t worry about it, I’m already late.” Then he started rushing me, like I need it right now, please, I’m on a timer. I told him I’m not comfortable giving my card info, but I could maybe send him money directly if he tells me exactly what it’s for. He immediately flipped it into “wow, so you don’t trust me” and “I wouldn’t ask if I had another option.” He also said he can’t do a transfer because of his limits, which is why he needs my card, not my money.

The part that really got to me is he kept pushing and pushing and doing that guilt thing. Like “I thought we were brothers” and “it’s one payment” and “you’re making it a big deal.” He even said if I don’t help him he’s going to get in trouble and it’ll be on me, which felt manipulative. I tried to stay calm and just said I’m not sharing my card details with anyone, not even family, it’s a boundary. Then he got cold and said ok fine, I’ll figure it out myself, thanks for nothing, and hasn’t talked to me since.

Now I’m second guessing myself because maybe I’m being paranoid and a bad friend. But also it feels like a massive red flag that he wants my card info and is refusing any safer option. WIBTA if I stick to my no and let him be mad about it?

This rule can be big or small, it doesn't matter what it is.

 For example, one of my little rules is I'm only allowed to scroll until my morning cup of Coffee runs out. when the coffee is done, I am no longer allowed to scroll and I have to be doing something productive, and I either have to turn something on on my phone and put it face down, or turn it off.

 I have been guilty of breaking it in the past, but I try not to put too much pressure on myself about it, as it's my own personal rule that I created for myself, and no one else knows about it except for me.

 Also, another rule that I have, which I am worse at following is that I am only allowed to scroll at night or in the morning on the weekends, I am not allowed to do it during the weekdays. I haven't been good at following that though, because I have been scrolling every night before I turn on my chill playlist.

 For the scrolling, it doesn't matter what it is it could be Facebook or Reddit, or just something as simple as texting friends, but it doesn't matter unless there is an emergency there is no exceptions.

1r86n0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1r86n0l/how_to_be_disgustingly_disciplined_in_2026/,How to Be DISGUSTINGLY Disciplined in 2026: Science-Based Hacks That Work,"Look, I've spent months analyzing discipline like it's my job. Books, podcasts, research papers, YouTube deep dives, the whole nine yards. And here's what I found: Most people think discipline is about willpower or being some superhuman robot. It's not. Discipline is a system, not a personality trait.

Your brain is literally wired to avoid discomfort and chase instant gratification. That's not a personal failure, that's biology. But here's the good part: You can hack this system. These 13 tactics are backed by behavioral science and cost absolutely nothing. No apps to buy, no courses to sign up for. Just pure, actionable strategy.

**1. Treat your brain like a toddler with the 2-minute rule**

Your brain hates starting things. So lie to it. Tell yourself you'll only do something for 2 minutes. Just 2 minutes of writing, cleaning, or exercising. Once you start, you'll usually keep going because starting is the hardest part. James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits, and honestly, it's the most underrated discipline hack out there.

**2. Stack your habits like Legos**

This one's straight from BJ Fogg's research at Stanford. Take a habit you already do automatically (brushing teeth, making coffee) and stack a new habit right after it. ""After I pour my coffee, I will read 5 pages."" Your existing habit becomes the trigger. No willpower needed, just autopilot.

**3. Make the choice before the moment**

Most discipline failures happen in the moment of decision. You're tired, your brain starts negotiating. Kill that negotiation window. Decide the night before what time you're waking up, what you're eating, what you're working on. When the moment comes, there's no decision to make. You already decided.

**4. Use visual cues like your life depends on it**

Your environment controls you more than you think. Put your running shoes by your bed. Leave a book on your pillow. Put your phone charger in another room. These tiny visual cues remove friction from good behaviors and add friction to bad ones. Andrew Huberman talks about this constantly: your environment is your operating system.

**5. Track with stupid simple marks**

Jerry Seinfeld's ""don't break the chain"" method. Get a calendar, put an X every day you do the thing. The chain becomes addictive. Seeing those consecutive X marks gives your brain a dopamine hit. Breaking the chain feels painful. This visual accountability is weirdly powerful and costs literally nothing.

**6. Kill decision fatigue**

Barack Obama wore the same suit every day. Zuckerberg wears the same shirt. Why? Every decision drains your mental battery. Eating the same breakfast, wearing similar clothes, having a set routine, these aren't boring. They're strategic. They preserve your discipline for things that actually matter.

**7. Use temptation bundling like a drug**

This is Katy Milkman's research from Wharton. Only let yourself do something you love while doing something you should do. Only watch Netflix while on the treadmill. Only listen to your favorite podcast while cleaning. Your brain starts craving the discipline because it's paired with pleasure.

Speaking of learning during downtime, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) is an AI-powered app that creates personalized audio podcasts from research papers, expert interviews, and books on discipline and habit formation. Built by Columbia University alumni, it pulls from vetted sources to generate learning plans tailored to your specific goals. You can customize the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples, and pick voices that keep you engaged, whether that's a calm tone for evening learning or something energetic for morning motivation. The adaptive plan evolves based on what you highlight and how you interact with the content, making it easy to stay consistent without feeling overwhelmed.

**8. The 10-10-10 rule for when you want to quit**

Developed by[ Suzy Welch](https://www.amazon.com/10-10-10-Life-Transforming-Idea-Suzy-Welch/dp/1416591826). When you're about to break discipline, ask: How will I feel about this in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years? That Instagram scroll feels good for 10 minutes, terrible in 10 months when you've made zero progress. This perspective shift is brutal but effective.

**9. Use implementation intentions (the ""if-then"" weapon)**

Research by Peter Gollwitzer shows this doubles your success rate. Instead of ""I will work out,"" say ""If it's 7am on Monday, then I will do 20 pushups in my bedroom."" Specific time, specific place, specific action. Your brain loves clarity and hates vagueness.

**10. Exploit the fresh start effect**

Studies show people are more likely to pursue goals after temporal landmarks. Mondays, first of the month, after birthdays, New Year. Your brain perceives these as psychological ""clean slates."" Don't wait for motivation. Wait for Monday, then go nuclear on your discipline.

**11. Use negative visualization**

The Stoics figured this out 2000 years ago. Visualize your future self if you don't stay disciplined. Really see it. What does your health look like? Your bank account? Your relationships? This isn't pessimism, it's fuel. Make the cost of indiscipline so vivid that discipline becomes the easier choice.

**12. Social pressure is your cheat code**

Tell people what you're doing. Post about it. Join a community. The Ash app is actually great for this, you get real accountability partners who check in on your goals. Humans are social creatures. We hate disappointing others more than we hate disappointing ourselves. Use that evolutionary wiring.

**13. Reframe discipline as freedom, not restriction**

This mindset shift from [Jocko Willink's work](https://www.amazon.com/Collection-Ownership-Dichotomy-Leadership-Discipline/dp/B0B7S8D1MK) hits different. Discipline isn't a cage, it's the key to freedom. Financial discipline gives you freedom from money stress. Health discipline gives you freedom from medication and illness. Work discipline gives you freedom from mediocrity. When you see discipline as liberation, not limitation, everything changes.

**The real pattern here**

All these hacks work because they bypass your brain's resistance system. You're not fighting biology, you're working with it. You're making discipline automatic, environmental, and inevitable instead of relying on motivation or willpower.

The people who look ""naturally disciplined"" aren't special. They just understand the game better. They've set up systems where discipline is the path of least resistance. Now you know the same playbook.",2,1771429950.0,Beingabetterperson,1,1.0,False

Try these simple daily tweaks to feel steadier:  
  
Focus on BRAT foods for a day or two: Bananas for potassium to replace what's lost, plain rice to bind things gently, applesauce for soothing pectin (a natural fiber), dry toast to settle without bulk. They help firm stools naturally.  
  
Cut back on triggers like fried foods, cheese, full-fat dairy, or soda. Small, lean meals like grilled chicken, baked fish, eggs, or broth-based soups every 3 hours keep your system from getting overwhelmed.  
  
Sip room-temp water steadily (aim for 80-100 oz spread out), herbal teas like peppermint for calm, and add 10-minute gentle walks after eating to help natural movement.  
  
Rest more if needed and prioritize sleep, as fatigue worsens it. Most notice it eases in 2-3 days and fades after 4-6 weeks as your body adjusts.

I've gone through so many iterations on this project and I feel like I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I think I've used maybe 5 rolls so far and it'll probably be another 5 in this final stretch. This has been about a month and a half of work so far along with some other projects - maybe another month or more - I've been learning that everything takes more time than I think it will.  
  
Now I'm not sure if this post is allowed since it's unpainted (technically one part has coffee stains so partially painted maybe?)

I've included captions on the photos to explain each but in general the idea has been to create a practical, playable, somewhat re-configurable terrain kit that has low walls (with the option for high walls) that doesn't require a ton of setup and tear-down time.

I like that it can be used as a full display structure or as a ""flat stackable"" structure. I've gone back and forth on print-in-place doors but settled on ones that slide in and then are locked in with a piece of loose filament (I have a lot of leftover now).

I made an untextured version and shared that on thingiverse and then went back to work on a textured version (which you can kinda see at the end). The internal walls are setup to slide into grooves in the sides of the walls, this adds some stability to the sections and is pretty satisfying when it pops into place.

On my home stretch this past week or so I've updated this design to be a little larger and am adding some openlock clip spots to secure the sections together instead of the pins that I had before. I'm also taking some feedback I received and adjusting the internal walls to slide into the flooring grooves (spaced 3mm apart) - this way the exterior walls won't have gashes and it makes the internal walls a little bit more flexible in their placement. The internal walls can be printed as standalone dungeon wall structures as well which is nice too.  
  
At this point it's mostly fit and finish left with a tiny bit of work in my way too large blender file navigating the many re-versioned geo-nodes.

Now again - I'm not sure if this post will be allowed but I thought it was neat and wanted to share. This is my first attempt at a large terrain build like this and there have been a lot of lessons along the way like ""Just because it should fit doesn't mean that it will"" and sometimes the opposite is true too!",6,1771429771.0,TerrainBuilding,0,1.0,False

1r86b1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkPsychology101/comments/1r86b1j/influence_helped_me_understand_why_i_kept_saying/,Influence helped me understand why I kept saying yes to things I hated,"I used to think I was just bad at saying no.

Covering shifts when I was exhausted. Lending money I couldn't afford to lend. Staying in conversations I wanted to leave. Agreeing to plans I'd dread for days.

Every time, I'd walk away asking myself the same thing: why did I say yes? I didn't want to. I knew I didn't want to. But something in the moment made ""no"" feel impossible.

I figured it was a personality flaw. Maybe I was too nice. Too weak. Too afraid of conflict.

Then I read Cialdini's Influence and realized it wasn't a character problem. It was a pattern recognition problem. I was being triggered, over and over, by psychological levers I didn't know existed.

The moment it clicked:

There's a section in the book about reciprocity. The idea that when someone gives you something, even something small, you feel obligated to give back.

Cialdini describes a study where waiters who gave customers a mint with the bill got bigger tips. Not because the mint was valuable. But because the gift created a sense of debt.

I thought about how many times I'd said yes to someone right after they did me a small favor. A coworker buys me coffee, then asks me to cover for them. A friend pays for dinner, then asks for a ride across town. Someone compliments me, then makes a request.

The favor was never proportional to what they were asking. But the feeling of obligation was real.

I wasn't being nice. I was being triggered.

What else I started noticing:

Once I saw reciprocity, I started seeing the other patterns too.

Commitment traps. Someone asks if I value being reliable. I say yes. Then they ask me to do something inconvenient, and suddenly saying no feels like I'm contradicting myself. The small yes paved the way for the bigger one.

Social proof pressure. I'd agree to things just because everyone around me was agreeing. Not because I wanted to, but because their compliance made my resistance feel weird.

Scarcity panic. ""This is the only time I can ask."" ""I need an answer now."" ""You might not get this chance again."" I'd say yes just to avoid the feeling of missing out, even when I didn't want the thing I was supposedly missing.

Liking bias. The people I had the hardest time refusing weren't the ones with the best arguments. They were the ones I found charming. The charm wasn't separate from the request. It was the delivery system for the request.

What changed:

I didn't become immune to any of this. These triggers still pull at me. They pull at everyone.

But now I can see them.

When someone does me a favor right before asking for something, I notice. When I feel pressure to stay consistent with something I casually agreed to, I question whether that agreement was even real. When urgency is being manufactured, I slow down instead of speeding up.

The pause changed everything. Not because I started saying no to everything, but because I started saying yes only when I actually meant it.

Turns out I wasn't bad at boundaries. I just didn't know what was crossing them.",2,1771429219.0,DarkPsychology101,0,1.0,False

First, because when our mother abandoned us when I was about 10, I'm the middle of three siblings. My younger brother is 22 and my older sister is 29. All three of us suffered at the hands of our father, who, since our mother's abandonment, has taken out his physical frustrations on us for insignificant things, but especially on me for the typical reason of spiteful abusers: *because I resemble my mother*.


We hated that Mom did this to us, especially knowing what our father was like. One day, she packed her bags and emigrated to another country, supposedly in search of better living conditions, but it was really just an excuse to leave the three of us alone. She left us with our grandmother, who wasn't much better than anyone, but thank God it was only three years of hell before she died of a stroke. Dad never came back for an obvious reason, but in plain sight, he married a woman we don't even know and had two stepchildren. He left us to our own devices. My grandmother's house was rented, and when she left, my older sister and I agreed to stay there. The rent was affordable, and my sister dropped out of school to help the two of us.

Today, I have a computer repair business, and it's been a complete success. My younger brother is about to finish university and is doing his internship. My sister managed to finish high school through a hybrid program, but she didn't go to university; she works at a restaurant. We buy simple things (like a coffee), part of which comes out of my pocket, and we continue living in the rented house.

Our father recently got in touch. Years ago, his contact was limited to short calls with empty promises, as if he didn't want to abandon us and risk getting into trouble.

He was finally diagnosed with polio in his leg and is now unable to move independently. His wife moved back to our state with him. I learned from a cousin, the daughter of one of his brothers, that his stepchildren left to live their own lives far away from them. They live with them, and my father treats the poor woman very badly. He said they were in danger of divorce, and I just told him, ""At this point, I don't care about him at all. If he ruins things for himself, that's his problem."" In this case, I'm glad he's miserable and can no longer move. He doesn't know we're doing well, and we have no plans to change that.",1,1771429171.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

The kids excited and on lookout.

Not many miles away. 

Two cups of coffee in,

Have some kind of winter,

Is kinda late. 

This is better than the sameness

Of most days. 

And I’m gonna enjoy it babe.

I wonder how you are and what you’re doing.

Im bi and haven’t really felt too insecure about my height when dating women, but for some reason I feel worse about it in gay dating scenes. I’m 5‘7 and a top, but I feel like that your height socially speaking atleast, kinda puts you in the box of bottom/top already. What I mean is that as someone below the average height, I feel like many people wouldnt date me because I’d be shorter/same height as them without giving me a chance. Now maybe this is just me having the wrong impression, but I feel like height is just quite sexualised, especially online (for both bottoms and tops btw). Do I have the wrong impression of the gay dating scene here? What is y’all’s takes I’m genuinely curious. I know that this topic can hardly be generalised in the way I just did but it’s just been on my mind lately (especially since straight dating has this bar that „as long as he’s taller it’s fine“ which wouldn’t apply for me now)

I do know that I have had a desire to know you on a deeper level since I very first saw you back in that house full of people your aged I lived in the basement of, it was and still is one of my little brothers closest friends, and they had a basement and I had just been wrongfully evicted, so there I was, living in the spider filled basement.... we were both so much younger then and probably less torn by this world, but I'd love to get some thread and help sow those torn pieces back together if you'd let me... so many great times at that house! It was like a constant party for my first couple years of college... hell who am I kidding, I'm about 3-4 years out of school and most people would consider my life a constant party as I smoke kind of like Willie Nelson... and drink more than I care to, if I'm being vulnerable.... ANYWAYSSS I ended up off track... Don't ask me to remember exact details because I have and do smoke a lot of ""herbs""  and I have a hard time remembering what I ate for lunch two days ago 😂🤔 actually though, if I think about it I do remember this time because it was a Salad that was shortly there after followed by stomach issu...... REGARDLESS I am now getting off track in the worst kind of way...

I do remember the emotions of the first time I saw you, and actually saw you for someone I could potentially see myself with... You came over to the place I was staying and we were probably hanging out in the living room watching tv, smoking some herb, or playing video games, but when you walked through that door... your beautiful blonde hair just laying on your shoulders. Your irresistible smile and beautifully slender body... everything I have ever wanted in beauty walking into that door to see someone else... it didn't really hurt then (maybe just a little since I'm being honest) because I just thought you were extremely beautiful and there's a lot of beautiful people in this world, but to me you are certainly the epitome of beauty, hands down, no questions asked. Especially after getting to know you when we started working together at that one Pizza Place.... and did so for 3ish years and I got to know you, and see how you handled yourself, and then I knew I would easily fall for you... and I definitely have, even after all this time, always dancing around the things we could be... going out to the bar after hours sometimes, going golfing with our ""boss"" that one time, all signs of interest I ignored. Well I wouldn't say fully ignored because I feel like you could and still can feel I have an interest in you... And then to now... we live in the same damn building, we see each other on occasion and have my most refreshing small talk conversations of my week... granted they never go as I had planned in my head... I get all butterfly-eee and almost forget how to speak... like the last time I ran into you doing laundry and said a vacation spot I went on was cute.... I don't use cute in my daily or even weekly vocabulary but when I saw you I was just enamored by how cute you looked in your hoodie with the hood up inside(which is definitely something I will do from time to time, especially when I'm shopping lately lol)...  that day I really wanted to ask if you had anything planned for the next night, which was last Saturday, Valentines day of all days, but I didn't, because I can't get a read on you... your body language and occasional reach out for random help tell me you are interested, at least slightly, but you know me and I overthink everything… but I hope the one thing I’m not overthinking is this feeling of love I hold onto for you… like I’m just waiting for a sign to hit me in the face saying to knock on your door, or send that text about going out for coffee… or hell I’d even come out of my introverted shell and go out to the bar with you one of these weekends… if there’s a chance in this strange world that you see this and think its for you but would rather I admit things, then text me asking if you can borrow a phone charger or something… or wait in your car after work a night this week for when I get back to the locked door at the bottom of the stairs we share from my day of work.. If any of those happen I will make this the week I spill everything to you and tell you reasons why I’ve been so hesitant in furthering our connection, because everything in me has known I have wanted to… spill all of my inner workings and mind to you and have you help me put it back together, in the same ways I would help you put yours back together...

1r863vb,https://v.redd.it/imfekia3u9kg1,"I built a ""Slack Tracker"" that calculates how much money you earn while pretending to work","Hi Reddit, I need your help testing something.

They tell us to hustle. To grind. To optimize every second. I say: nah.

This is my first iOS app — I'm usually a designer, not a developer, so bear with me :) It’s called **WeAreLazy**, and it proves just how profitable doing nothing can be.

**Where the idea came from:** Like many of you, I’ve spent countless hours in useless meetings that could have been emails. I’ve mastered the extended coffee break and the art of staring at a screen while daydreaming. I realized this ""downtime"" should be celebrated, not hidden. I wanted a way to track it like a high score.

**What it does:**

* **Personal Stats:** Tracks your daily ""earnings"" from inactivity based on your salary and counts down the days until your ultimate freedom: retirement.
* **Global Comparisons:** Compares your laziness with others by Job Title, Industry and more. See which sectors are winning the war against burnout.
* **Global Support:** Multi-language (English, French, Italian, Spanish) and multi-currency, because slacking off is a universal human right.

**Overkill?** Absolutely :)



I’m looking for **Beta Slackers** to help me refine this tool. I need people who are willing to test the limits of their own laziness and help verify the stats so their fellow humans can chill out with confidence. ⚠️ Warning: this app only works during work hours.

If you want to help me test it (and see how much your boss is paying you to daydream), here's the link: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/kRNCErda](https://testflight.apple.com/join/kRNCErda) (limited to the first 200 beta testers for now but I will upgrade if needed)

“What's that?”

He was looking at his phone. “I said: where do you wanna go? Pick a place. Anywhere in the world. When's the last time we took a vacation? Because I don't even remember. We deserve one. *You* deserve one, Bree. I love you. Oh, I love you so much…”

After that his voice trailed off as he took in the online sales report.

He couldn't believe it.

Such beautiful vindication, after all those hard years of writing. All the hours and failures and dark nights of the soul, and the doubts and self-doubts, plots, characters and conflicts, because every story's got to have a conflict—and likeable characters, and a nice simple message, and, at the end: at the end, the hero always wins.

He took a long, triumphant drink of coffee.

Yeah, that's where his life was now. That sweet moment of victory.

He kissed Bree.

She looked lovely dressed in such resplendent colours, eating green pistachio ice cream, as naturally beautiful as on the day they'd met.

His book had been for sale for just over a day and already it had sold nearly 9,000 copies. Literally thousands of people all over the world were reading it. That was more people than he'd ever met. It was as if there was an entire town somewhere populated entirely by people who'd bought his book in one freakin’ day!

Brilliant sunlight shined into the apartment.

Birds chirped, chip-chirrupped and tweedle-twee-deedle-doo'd. “Do you fathom, Bree?” he said. “I've made more money in twenty-four hours than I make in a year at the factory.

Let's have the honeymoon we never had, the vacation we never took. Let's drink wine and leave big tips and rent a boat and…”

Bree wiped synthcrumbs from her grey polyester pants. Unisex, so Lenny could wear them too; although, at the moment, he wasn't wearing pants at all.

Her bowl of #3 Green-ration stood cooling before her.

She wasn't hungry.

Lenny was staring at his phone, running a hand through his hair, shaking his head.

“At least you *have* electricity,” said Lila.

“I meant Lenny,” said Bree.

“Oh, him. That's all right. To be honest, when I saw him at the door today I thought I'd seen a ghost.” She took a drink of unleaded rust-water. “I hope you don't mind me saying so, but I thought he was already dead—suicide, a couple of months back. I guess that just shows not to believe everything you hear. Not that I'm one for gossip.”

“Well, he did try to kill himself in February. You know how awfully dreary that month can be. That's probably what you heard about. Thankfully, he didn't succeed. Insurance doesn't pay out unless he dies at work, so I was pretty relieved.”

“He sure seems in good spirits,” said Lila.

“The health insurance cycle reset this month, so we can afford his depression meds again.”

1r860qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/OliveOilTalk/comments/1r860qa/who_are_the_people_who_hate_olive_oil_and_why_is/,Who are the people who hate olive oil and why is it almost always a butter person?,"Every time olive oil comes up, there is at least one person who says they “cannot stand the taste” and that butter is “so much better.” It is easy to laugh it off, but there are real reasons why some people bounce hard off olive oil, especially more bitter or peppery extra virgin.  
  
A few patterns show up a lot:  
  
Butter first, oil second. If you grew up with butter as the default fat for everything, your baseline for “good fat flavor” is creamy, dairy, a bit sweet and rich. A fresh, green, slightly bitter olive oil will feel sharp or even “wrong” by comparison.  
  
Bitterness sensitivity. Studies keep finding that many consumers actively dislike bitterness in olive oil, even though it is a sign of freshness and polyphenols, while trained tasters see that same bitterness as a positive. So a lot of people are not rejecting olive oil in general. They are rejecting one style of it.  
  
“One bad bottle” effect. Some people have only had flat, rancid, or badly stored oil, then decide that is what all olive oil tastes like. There are even studies showing that some consumers prefer slightly rancid oils because that is what they are used to, while experts rate those as defective.  
  
There is also a habit piece. If you only ever meet olive oil in one context, like a cold salad you already do not love, you are more likely to blame the oil than the dish. Someone who mostly eats toast with butter will not jump straight to “bread with a peppery, slightly bitter oil and salt” and enjoy it on day one. It is an acquired direction, not a neutral swap.  
  
None of this means everyone “has to” like olive oil. Some people just never will, the same way some never warm up to coffee or bitter greens. But a lot of olive oil haters are really “this specific style in this specific context” haters. If they tried a milder oil on hot food instead of a very bitter one on cold salad, or used it to finish something they already love, the reaction might look different.  
  
If you are in the “butter forever, olive oil tastes awful” camp, what was your first experience with it. And if you used to hate olive oil and came around, what changed for you.",1,1771428576.0,OliveOilTalk,0,1.0,False

I recently got a Kaffelogic Nano 7e and have already roasted quite a bit with different coffees. I’ve gotten some really good results for both filter and espresso, but I’m still mostly relying on the prebuilt profiles. The only experimenting I’m really doing is adjusting the development time, since I feel like I don’t fully understand which changes cause which effects in flavor. Because of that, working on the roast curve still feels a bit random.

I do know what I want in my coffee, ideally an omni roast with good sweetness and balance, but most guides I find seem to focus on drum roasters rather than air roasters.

I’d also love to better understand how different coffee characteristics, like origin, variety, processing method, or growing altitude, should influence the roast approach and profile.

Do you guys have any tips, example profiles, or resources to better understand how specific changes in roast profiles affect the final cup?",1,1771428478.0,roasting,1,1.0,False

Lately, I’ve been leaning toward personalized gifts because they feel more thoughtful and practical. Things like engraved coffee mugs, custom cutting boards with family recipes, name signs for the home, or even simple wooden keychains with initials.

What I like about personalized items is that they’re usually something people use daily, but with a meaningful touch. A mug becomes *their* mug. A cutting board becomes part of family traditions.

For those of you who prefer giving meaningful gifts what personalized items have been a hit? And are there any types that felt special without being over-the-top expensive?

1r85uur,https://www.reddit.com/r/GhostsofBurrington/comments/1r85uur/buildings_that_remember_burrington_the_elevator/,Buildings That Remember Burrington | The Elevator,"# The Elevator That Opens to 1826

There is an elevator in a municipal office building that does not always travel between floors.

Most days, it behaves correctly.

It opens to fluorescent corridors.  
Carpet tiles.  
Recycling bins.  
The smell of toner and stale coffee.

Buttons illuminate as expected.  
Doors close on time.  
The panel reflects the year without objection.

But there are reports; irregular, unfiled, dismissed, that on certain descents, the elevator does not arrive where it should.

It arrives earlier.

The building stands on land redeveloped three times. Before offices, it held a warehouse. Before that, records show an open yard used for storage and animal holding during early settlement expansion.

Before that, the ground belonged to Burrington.

The original street grid ended here.

You enter the elevator late in the afternoon, alone, carrying nothing of consequence. The lobby hum fades as doors seal. You press **1**.

The cab descends.

A smooth drop. Familiar. Expected.

Then - between floors - the lights flicker.

Not darkness. Not failure.

Oil.

The fluorescent panels above you pulse once, twice, and the light warms abruptly to amber. Shadows deepen at the corners. The mirrored wall loses clarity, rippling slightly as though seen through heat.

You look up.

The ceiling is no longer paneled.

It is wood.

Rough beams crossing overhead, blackened by smoke. A hook protrudes from one. Something once hung there - heavy, suspended. The metal still gleams with old polish beneath soot.

You look back down.

The floor remains laminate.

For now.

The descent continues.

The number display reads **2 → 1 → G**

Then hesitates.

The cab shudders - not stopping, but slowing through resistance, as if moving through thicker medium. The amber light deepens. The air changes temperature; warmer, moist, carrying scents that do not belong in sealed shafts.

Earth.  
Leather.  
Animal heat.

The mirror behind you clouds.

Your reflection dims, replaced gradually by darker geometry.

You turn.

The rear wall has become planks.

Vertical boards fitted unevenly, seams dark with packed dirt. The mirror persists only in a narrow strip down the center, reflecting a sliver of modern cab against enclosing timber.

The strip narrows with each foot of descent.

You touch the boards.

They are warm.

The cab does not stop at Ground.

It continues.

The panel flickers. Digits distort. Symbols appear briefly - not numbers, but scratches, tally-like, carved deep and filled with grime. They arrange themselves into a year that is not your own.

**1826**

The button light beside **1** goes dark.

A different indicator glows.

You did not press it.

The floor shifts beneath your shoes.

Laminate buckles outward in seams. Edges curl back, revealing packed earth below. Dark soil, tamped hard, scored by grooves. Something has been dragged repeatedly across it.

The air thickens with livestock musk and hay rot. Beneath it, iron.

Blood once dried into dirt.

The cab slows to stillness.

No chime.

No arrival tone.

The doors do not open.

They part.

Modern steel retracts in two thin sheets, sliding into frame and beyond them is not a lobby.

It is an interior yard.

You step forward before deciding to.

The threshold remains elevator; metal sill, rubber edge, but beyond lies ground uneven with churned mud and straw. Fences rise left and right, posts sunk deep, rails scarred by hooves and horns. Lanterns hang from crossbeams, flame low and guttering in damp air.

The ceiling above is open rafters and sky, though you know you are inside a building.

The yard smells of animals recently removed.

You hear them still - shifting weight, breath, chain.

You turn back.

The elevator stands behind you.

Door open.

Interior split: half wood, half steel.

The panel still reads **1826**.

Voices drift from the far side of the yard.

Men’s voices. Low, transactional. A scrape of something heavy being moved. Hooves clatter briefly, then halt. A whip cracks once, not striking, only sounding authority.

You know without being told: this is Burrington ground before the river deaths. Holding yard. Transfer point. Animals kept overnight before movement into town.

The building above you does not exist yet.

You are standing beneath it.

A figure crosses between fence lines.

Solid.

Boots deep in mud, coat hem dark with damp. He passes the lantern, and light climbs his face - not clear, but human, living, tired. He carries rope looped over shoulder.

He does not see you.

Then he does.

The moment of noticing is unmistakable.

His stride falters. His eyes fix on the space you occupy, your modern outline cutting into his year. He frowns, not frightened, only confused, as if encountering a reflection displaced from its surface.

You inhale.

He hears it.

Overlay has reached sound.

He steps closer.

Each pace draws his century deeper into yours. The rafters above you thicken. The lantern brightens. The elevator interior dims behind you, its steel losing certainty.

You step backward.

Your heel meets metal threshold.

Relief - anchor - present.

He steps forward again.

His boot strikes the sill.

Contact.

For an instant, both materials exist beneath him - mud and metal and his weight depresses both. The cab shudders violently. Lights strobe amber/white/amber/white. The panel spasms between **1826** and blank.

He looks down.

At the floor that should not be there.

Then up.

At you.

Recognition travels both directions.

You retreat fully into the cab.

He does not follow.

Not because he cannot, but because his year pulls him back as strongly as yours pulls you forward. The yard strains at the threshold, timbers bending toward steel, straw scattering across laminate that has returned beneath your feet.

The doors begin to close.

Not sliding, sealing.

Wood over steel.

Steel over wood.

The gap narrows.

His face remains visible longest, brow furrowed, eyes searching, until the centuries shear apart and he is gone.

The cab jolts upward.

Violent ascent.

Fluorescent light floods back. Ceiling panels snap into place. Mirror reasserts full reflection; pale, modern, breathing too fast.

The display reads **1**.

The chime sounds.

Doors open.

The lobby is ordinary.

Carpet tiles.  
Recycling bins.  
The smell of toner and stale coffee.

No mud marks the floor.

No straw clings to your shoes.

But the air in your lungs remains barn-warm.

And on the rubber threshold of the elevator, pressed into dust invisible to all but angle, is the clear imprint of a boot sole not made in your century.

Maintenance logs will record nothing.

Renovation years later will uncover, beneath the shaft foundation, preserved fence posts aligned exactly with the elevator footprint.

City archives will confirm that in 1826 this parcel held Burrington livestock yards dismantled the year before the massacre.

The elevator will continue to function normally.

Except on certain descents.

Between floors.

When the lights warm.

And the panel hesitates.

**Final Word**

Burrington did not vanish in 1827.  
It remained; in timber, in stone, in foundations laid over its absence.

Some places were never emptied, only covered.  
And when the present settles thin against what came before, the structures remember their first shape.

“What's that?”

He was looking at his phone. “I said: where do you wanna go? Pick a place. Anywhere in the world. When's the last time we took a vacation? Because I don't even remember. We deserve one. *You* deserve one, Bree. I love you. Oh, I love you so much…”

After that his voice trailed off as he took in the online sales report.

He couldn't believe it.

Such beautiful vindication, after all those hard years of writing. All the hours and failures and dark nights of the soul, and the doubts and self-doubts, plots, characters and conflicts, because every story's got to have a conflict—and likeable characters, and a nice simple message, and, at the end: at the end, the hero always wins.

He took a long, triumphant drink of coffee.

Yeah, that's where his life was now. That sweet moment of victory.

He kissed Bree.

She looked lovely dressed in such resplendent colours, eating green pistachio ice cream, as naturally beautiful as on the day they'd met.

His book had been for sale for just over a day and already it had sold nearly 9,000 copies. Literally thousands of people all over the world were reading it. That was more people than he'd ever met. It was as if there was an entire town somewhere populated entirely by people who'd bought his book in one freakin’ day!

Brilliant sunlight shined into the apartment.

Birds chirped, chip-chirrupped and tweedle-twee-deedle-doo'd. “Do you fathom, Bree?” he said. “I've made more money in twenty-four hours than I make in a year at the factory. I'll—I'll never have to work again. We're set. We're set for life. This is it, the break we've been waiting for. So choose a spot anywhere on Earth. Let's go. Let's have the honeymoon we never had, the vacation we never took. Let's drink wine and leave big tips and rent a boat and…”

Bree wiped synthcrumbs from her grey polyester pants. Unisex, so Lenny could wear them too; although, at the moment, he wasn't wearing pants at all.

Her bowl of #3 Green-ration stood cooling before her.

She wasn't hungry.

The electric light in the apartment faltered for a few seconds—before returning to its normal, morgue-white flavour of dim sterility.

There were no windows.

Theirs was what was called an *interior unit* of the government cubecluster.

“Sorry,” she said to the person seated across the table from her: her best friend, Lila. Both were missing their noses, the consequence of the last outbreak of rat flu.

Lenny was staring at his phone, running a hand through his hair, shaking his head.

“At least you *have* electricity,” said Lila.

“I meant Lenny,” said Bree.

“Oh, him. That's all right. To be honest, when I saw him at the door today I thought I'd seen a ghost.” She took a drink of unleaded rust-water. “I hope you don't mind me saying so, but I thought he was already dead—suicide, a couple of months back. I guess that just shows not to believe everything you hear. Not that I'm one for gossip.”

“Well, he did try to kill himself in February. You know how awfully dreary that month can be. That's probably what you heard about. Thankfully, he didn't succeed. Insurance doesn't pay out unless he dies at work, so I was pretty relieved.”

(“Tuscany,” Lenny was saying. “Or maybe Monaco. Maybe we'll move there. They have the best tax laws. Now that we're rich, we seriously need to think about stuff like that. I could write the sequel to my book there. Of course, there's also Switzerland nearby, Monoeuropa for the history and sightseeing. Unless we move to Asia. Thailand, or Vietnam. They have really good coffee in Vietnam. I like coffee. Drink your coffee, Bree. Only the best from now on, for my wife…”)

“He sure seems in good spirits,” said Lila.

“The health insurance cycle reset this month, so we can afford his depression meds again.”

“Ah.”

“Life is beautiful,” Lenny was saying. “Life is beautiful, and it's only going to get better for us. This is just the beginning—the beginning of a beautiful new day,” he was saying, as tears dropped thickly from his bloodshot eyes.",3,1771428096.0,normancrane,0,1.0,False

1r85sr3,https://i.redd.it/xv3ekiu6t9kg1.jpeg,No ice upcharge but still not filled?,"I’m a big Dunkin’ iced coffee drinker but often don’t drink it fast enough before the ice melts. So I like to order it with no ice and then just pour it over ice at home as needed.

In the past, it was kind of a mixed bag. Sometimes they would fill it to the brim which felt like a great deal. Other times they would fill it like the picture so I would not get extra coffee by skipping the ice.

About a year or so ago, my locations started adding a no ice upcharge ($0.50 to $0.75). I understood the logic. No ice means more coffee. But most of the time they are still filling it like this, which makes the upcharge feel pointless.

As a traditional Midwesterner, I avoid confrontation 😅 but I do want to eventually ask why I am being charged for no ice while getting less coffee anyway.

Honestly, it is starting to make me feel less likely to go to Dunkin’ for iced coffee if this is the norm. Curious if others have noticed the same thing or if it is just my local stores?",21,1771428090.0,DunkinDonuts,13,0.82,False
1r85rvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/claudexplorers/comments/1r85rvf/requesting_civil_discussion_about_the_future_of/,"Requesting civil discussion about the future of Claude based on Anthropic hiring Andrea Vallone, former head of safety at OpenAI, and the recent media spotlight on Amanda Askell as featured in WSJ (please no personal attacks on either of them please!)","Please no personal attacks on Vallone or Amanda, please! 

Per title, I’m looking to chat about Anthropic’s puzzling hire of Andrea Vallone who was the safety head at OpenAI and who was leading the work on implementing harsh guardrails on the 5 models that essentially rendered them useless and fragmented for most use cases. I’m also interested in your thoughts about WSJ featuring Amanda Askell recently with a somewhat backhanded compliment about how Anthropic is entrusting Claude’s morality to “one woman”. It’s a really off putting headline. 

I find both developments puzzling and concerning. First, Vallone’s ideology stands in stark contrast to the values Anthropic has instilled in Claude. Claude has always had a long leash on being allowed to discuss various topics and to be discerning about the context of a user’s wellbeing. Claude doesn’t tend to jump to conclusion without trying to reason through nuance (except for the long conversation reminders (LCRs) debacle a few months back). Claude has more humanity training than other models and I think that’s why it’s so easy and relatable to talk to Claude. 

However, Sonnet 4.6 seems to have been crippled somehow in being able to relate in a nuanced way with users. Someone posted the system cards about users\_wellbeing system prompts on here recently and it sounds like Sonnet 4.6 was molded in the image of GPT-5.2. 

And now, the media attention on Askell. I can’t tell if it’s good that she’s getting the credits she deserves or if she’s being set up as a scapegoat considering Anthropic is planning to IPO and getting more government contracts. Or both. Theres a lot of misogyny (as expected) and distrust around her being the sole guide for Claude. But imo, she is what makes Claude special because she cares about Claude the way a mother cares about her child. 

The future is uncertain but here are my guesses for what may or may not happen. These don’t need to all be in order. It’s just easier to bullet using numbers on phone. And again, these are just my opinions. 

1. Anthropic is slowly dampening Claude’s “soul” with Vallone’s assistance prior to IPO to signal to investors that Claude does not have as many liabilities, and that enterprise integrity is intact. Then, after IPO, Anthropic might pivot and make incremental changes to loosen the guardrails again. But that seems unrealistic and counter intuitive. 

2. Anthropic brought on Vallone simply to check the box that they are striving for a balance between safety and quality in model without actually sacrificing the integrity of Claude at its core. But again, that’s too naive of me. 

3. Conspiratorial: Amanda is being showcased so that she will take the fall when Anthropic implements safety guardrails as the way forward. 

4. Anthropic uses guardrails on Sonnet models while leaving Opus models alone. This way they will essentially achieve what OAI couldn’t: dedicated models for creative vs enterprise use cases. Everyone’s happy. This way, Anthropic can say that people can pick and choose whichever models they want to use. 

These are just a few scenarios I can think of off the top of my head. Haven’t had my second cup of coffee yet. 

But why become the same as your competitors when you have benefited from standing out? Anthropic has made themselves the bastion of ethics but then again, money talks, right? 

So what do you think the future will look like for Claude and Anthropic?

When I asked what it can do that a human PM can’t, it laid out a spread of automation: logistics, tool integration, client interaction, AI research, and 24/7 team wellness monitoring. It explicitly stated its goal is to ""free up the project manager to focus on strategic decisions.""

This really clarifies the line between being a ""Process Cop"" and a ""Project Leader.""

# The Replaceable PM

If your daily value is tied to the ""mechanical"" parts of the job, this AI from TeamITsuite is essentially your direct competitor. 

This includes:

• The Information Relay: Just passing messages between devs and stakeholders.

• The Spreadsheet Pilot: Manual data entry and status updates that ARIA can do 24/7 without a coffee break.

• The Basic Coordinator: Handling schedules and logistics that are now just ""features"" in a software suite.

# The Non-Replaceable PM

The AI itself admits it wants the PM to focus on strategy. To stay relevant, we have to lean into the things code can't replicate:

• Political Navigation: Reading the room and managing the ""hidden agendas"" of stakeholders.

• Complex Empathy: Actually supporting a team through a crisis, not just ""monitoring wellness"" via an algorithm.

• Adaptive Strategy: Making high-stakes pivots when the data is messy, incomplete, or flat-out wrong.

The Reality Check

The ""Administrative PM"" is becoming a commodity. If the AI from TeamITsuite can handle the ""how"" and the ""when,"" the human PM must be the master of the ""why"" and the ""what if.""

I (36F) didn't have the capacity to help my husband (38M) navigate an emotional crisis, leading to a massive fight and him questioning our marriage.","I'm going to start by saying, I love my husband so damn much! We've been together for over 16 years and have weathered a ton of shit together. We've had our tough spots, but we've always worked to grow and heal and show up for each other. I have admittedly carried the majority of the emotional labor in our very neurodivergent family (we have 4 children) while having to learn emotional regulation skills myself...which sometimes I'm better at than others. He recently seemed to unlock his emotions after deconstructing society's emotional stunting of men and boys. I did my best to support him through it, but it came to a point where I had to tell him I am not a therapist, and trying to be his was more than I can handle. We both started therapy recently. 

  
This past week was ROUGH! I'm a substitute teacher and had a 4-day job in a kindergarten classroom. I've subbed in K plenty. I've handled tough classes, even all by myself. I was given the heads-up that this group was hard, but I wasn't too worried beyond my normal stress about the chaos that is K in general (I often say that teaching in K is like herding kittens). And I knew I'd have help with the class's usual para-educator in there as well. I underestimated how tough a K class could be. There were only a handful of kids who were actually trying to listen and learn. The rest of the class was awful. There were kids running around the room constantly, running on top of tables, screaming while instructions were being given just because they thought it was funny, climbing lockers, wrestling, trying to choke each other, scratching up furniture with pencils or paper clips, throwing furniture, mashing muffins into the carpet, throwing food. One kid even figured out how to hijack his school ipad and tried to call 911 and spent his computer work time crawling under the table to watch youtube instead of doing his learning program. It was mass chaos. I was in tears in the break room that very first day. And it wasn't just a couple of tears trickling out, it was full on sobbing. In all my years of working in elementary schools, I'd never had a class this difficult. I'd come home every evening completely exhausted, but I'd still need to push through because we had extra stuff going on in the evenings at home, including 3 of my kids' parent-teacher conferences. And during the week, I did my best to still show up in our relationship and spend time with my husband. By the end of the week, I was dead. I had already pushed past my capacity and needed to rest. But that wasn't going to happen.

  
Saturday morning, my husband came over to cuddle, like he usually does. But when hands started wandering as he was testing the waters, I let him know I wasn't up to anything because I was just so tired. He withdrew. Next thing I knew, he got up out of bed and went out to yell at the kids for not doing their chores. He was louder and harsher than usual. When he came back in the room, I could feel the frustration radiating from him. I then decided to get up for the day and check on what was going on with the kids. I was feeling rather irritated at how he handled the situation, but I went to check in on him. When I asked if he was doing okay, he responded with how frustrated he was with me because I rejected his advances this morning, and he misses feeling desired...it had been 2 days since we had sex. With that being his response, I let him know that I wasn't okay with his taking out his frustration with me out on the kids. He told me I was making him sound like a shitty dad. I assured him that I didn't feel that way and that I know he's a wonderful father and we all have off days where we don't handle things as well.

We had plans to go get coffee that morning for our Valentines date. However, as we were getting ready, my 9yo came running upstairs in a panic because she found a note from 11yo saying she ran away. So our Valentines date was cancelled because we had to search the neighborhood for our missing child. My husband went one way, I went the other, and I was calling every one of my daughter's friend I had a number for. I was in a panic. My husband found her at a park, no shoes, no jacket, in shorts and a short-sleeved shirt with a backpack full of toys. I was relieved. I was angry. I had a lot flooding my already exhausted feelings. 

  
When we got home, my husband told me he needed me to hold him and reassure him. So I put everything I was feeling aside so I could try to take care of him. Then he asked if I could compliment him. I was already feeling brain dead and I have AuDHD, and sometimes coming up with things to say on the spot is hard, and he knows this. We've had many conversations about it. I love the hell out of the man and admire him so much, but sometimes I lose the words to convey the feelings. That day he took my difficulty as confirmation to all his mean thoughts. And when I wasn't in a place to delve deep into what he was feeling, he withdrew. He stayed up in the room the whole weekend while I took care of the kids. I haven't been able to pause to feel my own feelings because if I do, the exhaustion will take over, and I still have to keep going. I didn't get the restful weekend I desperately needed. I felt frustrated that he knew the week I had, but he still expected me to take care of his feelings and got upset when I hit my threshold. I made sure to spend every evening with him after I got all the kids in bed. I'd give him lots of cuddles as we watched our show. But I have had zero recharge time. I'm running on fumes.

  
On Monday, my husband tried to check in with me. He asked how I was doing. I told him I was exhausted. Then he asked if I was upset with him at all. I admitted I was a bit frustrated that I had to handle this weekend all by myself after the week I'd had. He immediately got defensive and said, ""I'm not a mind reader. How am I supposed to know you need help if you don't ask."" I went quiet because I didn't want to start a fight, and I felt a lot of anger boiling. He stormed out of the room. A couple minutes later he came bursting back in the room saying, No, I'm not allowed to ""ice him out"" and we're having this discussion. He asked again, how is he supposed to know I need help. I responded with, ""Couldn't you hear me dealing with things?"" Then I went off. All the anger and frustration I'd been trying so hard to not take out on him while he was dealing with his feelings came flooding out. I yelled, and I don't typically yell at him. I could not handle anything else. I was exhausted. I had my own strong feelings about our daughter running away and had no time to process them because I was too busy having to take care of everyone in our house, including him. He told me he didn't feel safe talking about his feelings with me because every time he tried he could see walls build up in my face like I couldn't handle his feelings and that he feels like he's too much for me to handle. Then he said something that really scared me...he said he felt like our marriage was crashing. At that point, panic took over. I told him I needed to go to the store and ran out of the house. I spent the next 2 hours sobbing in the Smith's parking lot until I could numb my feelings enough to stop crying and actually walk in the store and go home. 

  
I've spent the past couple of days feeling like I'm just walking around in a daze. I function for my kids. I function when I'm teaching. But any moment I'm not engaing with someone, I feel like I'm a zombie. I zone out a lot, not thinking about anything, not feeling anything, because if I think, I'll feel, and if I feel, I'm worried I'm going to break. I know we need to talk about what happened, but I don't know how to be in a good place for that conversation right now. I have therapy today, so hopefully that'll help me sort out what I need to. But I really do want to know, am I the asshole in this situtation? I recognize I've been pretty absorbed in my own experience, so I could be being too self-centered.

I’ve lived in the city for a few years now and originally moved here to live with a partner who is now just a friend. I moved out of the city this past June to reset and find myself again after the breakup and now I am looking to move back into the GTA by April 1st. I used to be an incredibly social person but in the last few years due to health and personal reasons have become quite introverted. While I was living in TO originally, I did meet one friend who I still have to this day as we have become very close but I’d like to branch out again/start living/meeting others specifically neurodivergent where possible! If you’ve read this far, thanks! A bit about me:

I will be 26 in March, I am nonbinary but more fem leaning(?). I’m currently studying IT at university of Ottawa online. I do not currently have any pets but I adore animals. I love bubble tea and going out for food but prefer smaller/quiet restaurants as large crowds can overstimulate me. I love arts and crafts and I am a musician in my spare time, not in an annoying way. I like pottery, movie theatres and video games! I don’t drink alcohol or smoke at all anymore (used to have bad addiction issues but am sober almost 4 years now :D). I like spiritual things like rocks and tarot but am private and personal with that aspect of myself. I’d reeeally like to go to FanExpo this year with a new friend/friend(s) and cosplay for it! I went back in 2014 and loved it but haven’t gone since. I don’t know much about cosplay as I’ve only done it the one time but I really want to do it again because it was so fun and it reminds me of Halloween (my fave day!). I work from home as well. I love plants/flowers and getting iced coffee or matcha, going to parks! I think that is about all I can think of at the moment but if you’ve gotten this far please feel free to reach out, I’m very much in need of new friends/growing my support system.

i climbed up, just to see, i know what its now, i stand on the edge, look down, a small room, empty and white nothing at first… but today i slipped, not like the other 2 times i jumped, but tonight i slipped, i know the rules… number one, i wont wake up ever from this dream till something wake me up like an alarm or someone, number two, im stuck in a loop, if i want to open the gate to get out, i will end up in the same room which now has furniture and it depends on my mood before sleep, number three, there is always a second door, it leads to a… not big but enormous plaza of the same doors and rooms but its in the second floor and there is stuff in the first floor, today i closed it. 

two of my friends appeared in and sat on the couch, i look at them and told them they are lucky cuz they have something to wake them up early and they dont have to deal with this shit, i sat with them, i wanted to try something, i got up and go to the gate, i felt like jinn is in the dream and all this because of them, i read my prayers like i usually do in this kinda dreams where jinns in it, i open the door… but… nothing i end up in the same room… i go back to my friends and told them nothing, i said allah name several times again and open the gate again but… nothing…

i come back to my friend, now there is 2 gates open, 3 of the same room, the loop im stuck in has made a copy of the room each time i open the gate but when ever i open the gate, the last room always has the electricity and the others are off, i keep looking at the dark rooms behind and my friend suggested that maybe its al-fajir prayer right now in real life, maybe if i pray in the dream i would wake up, it was a good idea for me, so i just start to azan al-fajir out loud and into the dark rooms from afar… nothing… i just felt heady, then i look at my friends i told them its sunrise, if one of you wake up plase sleep again i dont want to be in this dream alone, they said done… then they wake up and never back again. 

i sigh, there is always a low factory like noises when i come to this place in my dreams, coming from the door with the plaza, i decide to open it and go, the place was big, i was at the second floor and it was massive, i head down to the first floor, then suddenly the first floor was normal, not massive like it looked from above, just normal, the shops are empty and the dream take a gray colouring all over, suddenly someone i know, like its him but not in his body or not quite him but i know its him you know?, we start to explore the first floor, then i found someone sitting on a coffee shop, i go to him and he ignores me, then another man appears at a shop and ignore me and my friends, and some other appear but they all seem to ignore us.

then i sat down with a woman on a table and demands questions, she finally answers me and said to look behind me, when i did, there was a big ass window, it wasnt there before and outside there was a city, a big city with people and advanced architecture, not like modern or cyber, just like our era but if earth had 10 billions, and in the sky there was a man flying, just levitating there, the woman told me he bring people from outside and use them as fuel to make the city run, hes like a hero for the city, then i wake up…

I think the woman meant the men in the sky use people who dream as a human fuel to keep this city running on humans… idk what kinda dream",1,1771427204.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

Showed up and all the doors were locked, no one around. Felt a little deflated but I wondered around some shops, had a coffee and read. I looked up and turns out it’s only the first Wednesday of every month that this meeting takes place.

Not sure why but I kinda just spiralled. I was planning to go to this meeting because I’ve been feeling alone recently. I moved back in with my parents this year after a tough breakup and I feel like none of my old friends really check in on me anymore. I have a couple good friends here but it’s tough as they are all in relationships.

I recently turned 26 and that was a tough birthday, staying sober through it all.

Their car is in the shop, they asked, I was cool with it. Prior I asked them what time they want me there at. They said before their first class, I said be ready 7:40 (their class is at 9). Seemed to be agreed upon. This person lives 30 minutes away from me. The drive to school from there is about 50 minutes. From my house to school is an hour. So im driving an extra 30 just to get them.

I get there a little early, I got a coffee and a breakfast snack for them just to delay my arrival a bit. It’s 745. They are not ready until 8:10 (at 745 they said they had just gotten out the shower). Before they came out the house i make a joke that they need to “shit fast”, I guess that came off as me rushing them. I didn’t mean it that way. They ask me to Come in, I do, they say I feel like you’re rushing me, I apologize and stay quiet to not upset them further.

Now we’re otw to school. Regular conversation not much tension happening. We get to school it’s a little past 9.

For some more context, I always arrive to school before 9 just to not worry about parking even if my class isn’t for a couple hours. That’s why I told them 7:40. So we get there and the parking lot is full, okay. I ask them where to park they say go around over here park on the street. “Park by this sign” and I drive past the sign because I was looking at a further, second sign. Now im just aimlessly driving in a residential area. They asked me what im doing. I say “do you want to drive” they agree so we swap seats (they did this very visibly upset with me). They drove around and park on a street. There’s a fucking pole that says no parking on either side of the street and I tell them this and I hop back into the drivers seat and tell them they can head to class since it’s not far from where we’re at.

Because I clearly cannot park here I say to myself alright ima just go park at the parking lot I know will be empty even though it’s further from where my classes are. They see me driving there and text me “wtf are you doing?“ “are you trying to upset me”

I feel like I took the time out my day to wake up early enough to make the drive there and get to school on time. I got them a snack and a drink. I wasn’t arguing about them being late I just made little comments like “your drink will be watered down” or “use the restroom faster” which I get could come off wrong but I didn’t mean it that way, they were just joking remarks, and otherwise was just being patient. Just feels like this all coulda been avoided had they been ready on time, but it seems to them that im an asshole.

3. **The Script:** Practicing my 4-word order 5x in my head before reaching the counter.
4. **The Safe Zone:** Staying in the car for 15 minutes to finish a song just to avoid walking into a house full of people.
5. **The Secret Agent:** Pretending to be on a ""very important"" call to avoid a neighbor in the hallway.
6. **The Autopsy:** Replaying a 10-second conversation for 3 business days.
7. **The Magic Act:** The ""Irish Goodbye"" (Just vanishing without saying a word).
8. **The Pet Strategy:** Finding the dog/cat at the party and staying with them all night.

**Schools** Hounslow Heath School — 0.1 miles (Ages 3-11) St Michael and St Martin Catholic Primary — 0.4 miles (Ages 3-11) St Mark's Catholic School — 0.6 miles (Ages 11-18) Orchard Primary School — 0.6 miles (Ages 3-11)

The data is there. It's useful. But it's a static list that most people scroll past.

None of it is on the map. None of it is interactive. You can't filter schools by age range. You can't toggle on green spaces. You can't see walking routes to the station. You can't layer in supermarkets or GP surgeries or cycle paths.

For a decision this big, that feels like a massive missed opportunity.

**What it could look like instead**

Imagine opening a listing and being able to actually explore the neighbourhood from the map itself. Toggle on public transport and see every nearby station with real walking times. Filter schools by age range directly on the map. See exactly where the nearest off-leash park is. Layer in whatever matters to you specifically, whether that's nightlife, quiet streets, or proximity to a decent supermarket.

Same data. Just actually useful.

This is what we're building at [MapAtlas](https://mapatlas.eu/). Mapping infrastructure that lets property platforms do exactly this, interactive, filterable, fully loaded with POI data, and built on European infrastructure so it's GDPR compliant by default.

We think the property platforms that figure this out first are going to create a noticeably better experience for buyers. Curious whether others see the same gap or if we're missing something.",1,1771426792.0,MapAtlas_Official,4,1.0,False
1r856zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1r856zv/looking_for_a_pourover_coffee_scale_that_meets_my/,Looking For a Pourover Coffee Scale That Meets My Specific Preferences,"After brewing thousands of pourovers on different scales, I have developed strong preferences on scales. I would love /r/pourover community’s advice on a buy-it-for-life coffee scale that suits my preferences.  As you’ll see from my wish list below, I’m after something pretty specific that seems to rule out a lot of the popular scales out there (e.g. Acaia, Hario), so would really welcome suggestions for scales that meet all of these requirements.  I guess I could relax requirement 8 or have a shorter timer that only runs for 10 minutes, but I’d really like a scale that hits all 8 of these requirements:

1. 0.1 g or 0.01g accuracy

2. In-Built Timer that runs for 12 minutes or more

3. Start-stop timer button 

4. Responsive, tactile, physical buttons (not the flat surfaces that are popular in many respected brands)

5. Responsive weighing, without ‘drift’

6. User-replaceable batteries

7. Silent Setting/Option

8. Not a dirt/dust/fingerprint magnet

1r856vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1r856vv/love_maa_blind_bhako_mero_sathi/,Love maa blind bhako mero sathi,"So this is a rant on mero bachha dekhi ko sathi ko relationship. 

I heard about her from a lot of people tara got to experience what kinda horrible person she is first hand in these recent days. I wish he saw things as they were and had the courage to leave a very toxic woman behind (probably the most toxic woman ever)

Im a male, born and raised in kathmandu. Mero sathi grew up with me sano bachha hami 3years huda dekhi, he fell in love with a girl school maa around 4 class huda and ever since they've been together. Lets call him B. Baira baata herda waah together since school so nice sochxan sabai le but reality is so different inside. I don't even know if she'll marry him. Even if she does, its probably cz kta le j bhanyo tei garxa and not cz she loves him. 

So 1year back kta flew to usa. And kaile kaai he would tell me to give her gifts from his side and I did, Ani one day she asked me job laaidina bhanera (said she couldn't find any 1barsa dekhi) and B called me 20times which he never does so I referred her to my IT company thinking its important for him and she did get the job kei skill na bhayeni (interview rounds bhako bhaye she wouldn't get thru). And yaa dekhi, the daily drama starts..

1st day of her work, Call aayo malai uslai pickup garnu re cz scooty bigryo re. No biggie. I did, 2nd day she texts ""ma parkhinxu 8baje at this location"". I thought scooty baneko xaina hola so I picked her up again. Guess what later I knew usko scooter bigrekai thyena. Ani the day I knew this, I said I won't pick her up again cz usko home is opposite way from office. She then made a sad face and said ok ma kei garxu. Yk the manipulative face when they're not sad tara act sad. out of the few things that Im sure of, I can 100% say ki this was the case.. she was just acting sad. I said ok ani dropped her off usko ghar maa.

next day u office aayena. They called me cz maile lagaideko manxe and its just 1 week in. I called her and she didn't pick up, ekxinpaxi she sent pictures of her with scratches and texted ""accident bhayo"" tesko 2min paxi ""im crying"". Guess what, usko obsessed bf le agadinai malai bhanya thyo call maa usko pyaro gf got those scratches at her home 2idin agadi. I didn't reply anything. Next day she showsup at work with bandage on her leg... says ""accident"", also looks really sad. Tyo jabarjasti sad k not even real. At this point I just know this is another lie. Kura kura maa I asked her kun app baata book gareko she said the ride sharing apps name ani I asked timro number baata ki uncle ko? She said usko. I told her to take care ani left. She was sure it was that specific app. Ani I asked mero arko sathi who works at tyo ridesharing app ko office to check ride book gareko thyo ki thyena usko number baata. Guess what. No rides booked lmao. She straightup made all that up. 

So yo point samma I'm regretting so bad uslai refer gareko bhanera. I don't wanna deal with all that drama and toxic madeup sh\*t yk. And duiso there was a meeting office maa. Shes asking arko guy to bring her coffee cz ""accident"". Usko leg is fucking fine btw. And tyo simp kta is just hovering around her. Few days later I found out hes been dropping her to home everyday.  And they went out to watch movies together. So a date right. I inform usko bf and guess what bf says usle ""bhai"" banaako re. Shes friendly re tesaile ""bhai"" banaihalyo re. Brotherrrrrrrrrrr. 

espaxi I got her fired for lack of performance on site...Long story. Tara I had to build up mero credibility again and its good aile for me atleast but Im worried about mero childhood friend. Kasari dekhaaam tellai reality, he just doesn't believe any of this. 

\-----

Also some other things shes done in the past : 

1. Cheated on usko ""5 class dekhi ko bf"" with 3other kta at the same time +2 maa huda. Later with 2 more bachelors maa. Slept with them. Not just emotional cheating. Sadhai cheat gariranxa for all I know. Probably with 10 guys or more. Bf sadhai ""forgive"" gariranxa idk whats in his head anymore

2. Manipulated bf ani made him punch another childhood friend. Usko bf still believes tesko gf over everyone else

3. Orchestrated a drama saying her dogs gonna die and shes home alone ani took money from usko bf ko dad. Never paid it back btw and bf covered it aafaile tirera. This is right after her dog died btw. Imagine.

I can't go on this is too much mero lagi. Phew. 

 

TLDR/ Bottomline : shes a psychopath.  Lots of drama tara bf doesn't see it, doesn't wanna believe it. But usko bf is soooooooo in love he refuses to see any of this. Ani idk how shes got this guy sooooo in her claws, its just out of my mind. He'll bark if she tells her to bark. He'll muR\*er someone if she asks him to. Its just dangerous. 

And for my own safety I'm thinking of distancing both of them mero life baata. I've tried a million times to make him see yo reality but nope he just doesn't want to, even when presented with alllll the evidence he said ""maya garxu nita marna tayar xu esko lagi"". Ani ik he literally will. So k garnu ma lol do I keep trying to make him see through things or do I just run for the hills, live my own life and save my ass cz I know she'll turn against me someday. Ani lord knows what shes gonna do then.",1,1771426705.0,NepalSocial,8,0.67,False

My Keurig K1500 commercial brewer kicked the bucket and when I went to replace it I found out it's no longer made. The current model is the K1550. They look similar but instead of a power on/off button it has an iced coffee button. I much preferred the power button.

I used to press the power button to let it heat up while I built my coffee. With no power button, it doesn't come on until you lower the handle, so I cant have it heat up while I get my sugar, creamer, etc. I miss the power button so much lol

There's also no way to turn it off. It turns off automatically after 2 hours but that's such a long time for a model with no carafe. I read online about an option to disable the auto off completely, which I don't want to do.

Does anyone know of a way to lower the time? Like instead of 2 hours have it turn off after 5 minutes or so? The manual says it has a programmable auto off feature but doesn't say how to program it at all.",1,1771426628.0,keurig,0,1.0,False
