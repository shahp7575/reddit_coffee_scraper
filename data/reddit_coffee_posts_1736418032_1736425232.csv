My (24M) coworker (30-40M, not sure on his age) has been texting me wanting to be friends. I don‚Äôt work directly with him but we‚Äôve had some conversations while passing each other in the halls about where we‚Äôre working and what our work is like etc, then on new years day he messaged me for the first time wishing me a happy new years and when I responded he said something along the lines of ‚ÄòI want to be your friend or text mate‚Äô and I thought sure, just some casual occasional chatting with this guy.

But then he starts messaging me a lot and sometimes I find the things he said a little odd, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a cultural difference? For reference I‚Äôm Irish and he‚Äôs Filipino, I‚Äôm also autistic so I‚Äôm not really good at judging these things but I work with a lot of Filipino people and haven‚Äôt had something like this happen before. So he‚Äôs said things like that he wants to have lunch together at work and outside of work like at a cafe (he‚Äôs married to a man and I‚Äôm also very happily in a relationship with someone and he knows this, so I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs something romantic but it‚Äôs also so odd to me??) We‚Äôve had a handful of short conversations in person so I would have no idea what we‚Äôd talk about and the other day he was very insistent on having lunch in work together and it was incredibly awkward, we didn‚Äôt have much to talk about. Afterwards he texted me and said that I‚Äôm an awkward and shy boy and I‚Äôm like wtf?? 

He‚Äôs also texted things like ‚ÄòI felt something different when I first saw you, I said to myself I want to know you and want you to be my friend‚Äô and ‚Äòyour messages are like coffee to me, it keeps me awake the whole night üåôüòâ‚Äô (this guy barely uses emojis apart from this time)

This situation is really stressing me out because he‚Äôs really pressuring me to meet up with him, like pick him up and drive him to a cafe (after he offered to pick me up and I managed to be like ‚Äòno I like driving when I have the chance‚Äô and he was like ‚Äòthen you could pick me up, it‚Äôs nice to drive to a destination together‚Äô) and it just doesn‚Äôt feel appropriate to me especially given our age gap? Like I have nothing in common with this guy apart from working at the same place.

If there‚Äôs any Filipino people who could maybe give insight as well? Just not sure if it‚Äôs cultural thing but I‚Äôve also met other queer Filipino people and they haven‚Äôt been like this.

TLDR; My older coworker is pressuring me to be his friend and it‚Äôs giving more than just friend vibes despite him knowing I‚Äôm in a relationship (and is married himself). Help üò≠",1,1736423934.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,4,1.0,False

It all started when I was 17, armed with nothing but determination, a $50 budget, and an unhealthy amount of caffeine.

I'd been obsessed with the idea of creating a more human-like AI assistant, so I decided to cobble together a prototype using whatever free resources I could find online. My ""lab"" was basically my bedroom closet, lined with aluminum foil because I thought it would help with... something? (Spoiler: It didn't.)

After three sleepless nights, fueled by instant coffee and dreams of changing the world, I emerged with my creation. I proudly showed it to my best friend, expecting amazement. Instead, all it could do was recite coffee facts and occasionally make dial-up modem noises. Not exactly the breakthrough I was hoping for!

But you know what? That hilariously bad prototype taught me more than any textbook could. It showed me how much I didn't know, sparked my curiosity to learn more, and ultimately led me to found my AI startup,*StarCy*, at 18.

While I'd love to find love again and be with my life partner, I find myself in a transitory part of my life. I'm working on myself and to be honest, it'd be nice to have some company at times.

Are you also so tired of the modern dating scene that you want to go to the top of a mountain and scream? Well you're in good company!

What I'm looking for: someone to chat with, share details about our day to day and check in with each other, someone to go out with on the weekends or stay in and make goodies with a hot beverage and keep each other warm. I'm not looking for anything long term, but if there's chemistry and we vibe well then all the better! I'm also not looking for pen pals where we just text back and forth till one of us looses interest. That said, I'd prefer if you within ""day trip"" distance from central Ohio, although I do find myself in Asheville NC occasionally so if you're down that way, feel free to reach out too! (I could always use an excuse to visit). I'm also looking for someone between 26-38 but if you're a little older or younger it's not necessarily a deal breaker.

Some major notes about me:

Single and unmarried

Child-free and staying that way (I'm actually scheduled to get a vasectomy) I'm not looking to have a family

Leftist/liberal. If you're not, we probably won't vibe

Agnostic. It's fine if you're not but religion is not a part of my life

Fit, 5' 11"", growing out my hair, tattooed, pierced ears, glasses

Open minded, curious, likes to learn

kink and üçÉ friendly

A little more about me: My friends would probably describe me as cerebral, kind, and soft spoken (and my therapist said I was a good man). Most animals generally feel at ease around me. I work full time in healthcare and a few days a month at a Non-profit. I own a house and a car. No pets but I've got plants! I like staying active and recently took up hot yoga and loving it. I like going on hikes and bike riding when the weather is favorable. I enjoy an occasional craft beer and barcade trip. I love D&D and would like to form a group again someday. I occasionally play video games and read (just started Wind and Truth). I'm a pretty good cook and baker as well. I brew kombucha and I'd like to take up woodworking over the winter.

If this catches your eye or if you have any questions, come say hi! (I don't use the app so I'm more likely to see a DM over a chat) I'd love to hear about your hobbies and what you're passionate about. Do you prefer coffee or tea? And if you want to send a photo of yourself I'd appreciate that!

**First things first‚Äîlet‚Äôs normalize it.** Failure is as human as having that third cup of coffee on a Monday morning. ‚òïÔ∏è It happens, and it stings. But here‚Äôs where the magic happens‚Äîit‚Äôs how we rise from the rubble that counts. Think of failure as a plot twist in your life story, not the final chapter.

**So, how do we get back up? Let‚Äôs dive in:**

1. **Embrace the ‚Äúouch‚Äù**: Yeah, it hurts. Acknowledge it, feel it, but don‚Äôt unpack and live there. The faster you confront the uncomfortable, the quicker you‚Äôll heal. Remember, even superheroes needed a moment to regroup before saving the day. ü¶∏

2. **Learn and journal**: Grab a pen or your notes app. Write down what went wrong, but also jot down what went *right*. The latter often gets forgotten in the self-blame spiral. Small wins deserve a pat on the back too!

3. **Plan, but make it fun**: Planning your comeback doesn‚Äôt mean it has to be all serious and grim. Sketch out a roadmap with colorful markers, or make a digital vision board. Infusing some fun keeps the motivation alive!

4. **Talk it out**: Share your experience with a trusted friend or a therapist. Sometimes, verbalizing your journey can provide new insights or even just a hearty laugh over what you initially chalked up to disaster.

5. **Start small, think big**: It‚Äôs tempting to aim for the stars right after a fall, but sometimes a mini-goal is what you need to rebuild confidence. Turn ‚ÄúI have to run a marathon‚Äù into ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start with a 5K.‚Äù

6. **Humor is your secret weapon**: Failures can feel less daunting with a sprinkle of humor. Ever tried laughing at yourself? It‚Äôs oddly therapeutic. If anything, it makes for a hilarious story to share at parties. üòÑ

**Life's a constant rollercoaster of ups and downs.** So why not buckle up, scream when needed, and throw your hands in the air for those unexpected twists?

We are the owners of nothing
The ones that don't appear in the fairy tales
We construct the dream palace with mud
We don't have anything, and yet we've got everything
When you are missing things, you make something up
If there is no horse, I ride a cart
We find a way since the womb
Like crabs, who breathe without having a nose
We make wonders with what falls from the sky
We cool it in the river if there's no ice
And we feel like the like the kings of Castilla
We shine what doesn't shine
Without a bullet, prepared for war
We learned to plant without soil
Top notch, but unexpensive
Like academy dancers, but barefoot
We did it without amplifiers
Why would we want radios if here there are drums?! Hey!
There's no caviar here, but there is corn
There's no caviar here, but there is corn
There's no caviar here, but there is corn
Why would we want radios if here there are drums?! Hey!
 
Come in without a key, the party is open
Our houses don't have a door
And the colonizer that doesn't steal be not afraid
Here witches fly without a broom
Champions without without winning the cup
If there are no clothes
Let the soup keep us warm
Here we knit without a thread
Everything is possible
We move without fuel
There is no glue, but there is saliva
Everything adds up
We make foam without soap
Under the rain, without an umbrella
We are rowing in an empty lake
We learned to filter coffee without a coffe maker
And to go up even if there are no stairs
We invent inventions
Here one has tondance
Because there is no seat to sit on
 
We did it without amplifiers
Why would we want radios if here there are drums?! Hey!

","Jake and Jackie Hughes, owners of Smokin Jack's BBQ food truck.  COMING SOON, a brick and mortar location in Downtown Owosso!

‚ÄúWe are brothers, we grew up here in Owosso.  

We're bringing that food truck flavor we are known for into a brick and mortar.  We will have some seating available but mainly we're going to cater to takeout. Kind of like we do with our food truck, people come up and we're really fast at getting the food out. It's nice to have a place of our own here. We like being close to downtown, because we know a lot of stuff goes on downtown where people can easily walk over here. 

Our most popular items are brisket, and brisket with macaroni cheese. We are going to try not to run out. We've been adding more and we can't keep up, we sell out on brisket every time. We also have special items, like our burritos and our mac bowls. Our mac and cheese is our most popular side. We have baked beans, coleslaw, cheesy potatoes, loaded potato salad, and then we're tinkering around a few other things. 

I (Jake) fire up the smoker around 4:30 in the morning. I make coffee and I just sit outside by the smoker. I have a chocolate lab, and he hangs out with me out there. I love it. Meanwhile, I'll (Jackie) be down here prepping up sides and everything, and prepping the meat for the next day as well. 

We both worked other jobs but during the pandemic we didn't get any time off and got burned out. We were smoking food out of his garage and it just kind of developed into more. People were telling us how good our ribs were.  Then we won a couple of competitions. We entered and won the Ovid Carriage Days rib competition two years in a row and the second year we won with our potato salad as well. After that, we realized we had something good. 

From there, we both decided this was what we wanted to do. It kind of fell into place.  A guy messaged us asking if we wanted to buy his food truck. He gave us a really good deal. It was completely set up. So he helped us out a lot. We just had to get licensed and go to town. We gave our jobs notice and went for it full-time. 

It‚Äôs cool that we can work together. I think that's why our food's good because there's three of us (Jake‚Äôs wife helps too) working together. We can butt heads but the thing is, we always work through it. We share a passion, we all love cooking.‚Äù",2,1736422929.0,Owosso,1,1.0,False

1hxavoo,https://i.redd.it/iv5upckrfybe1.png,Tried a few clones from Scentedelic ,"Bought a few perfumes from Scentedelic recently in their FB live sale. Here's some short description of how each of these smell based on very initial impressions. 

## Nebula Nectar - ‚Çπ999 - Clone of YSL Black Opium   
I've the Original Black Opium as well, and this is a really really well done clone. Clone smells as good as the original with nice vanilla and coffee hints. The cost to Performance is insane as the OG cost me 7K from Lifestyle 


## Moksha - ‚Çπ1450 - Private Blend - Not pictured here   

Smells like how a very good temple would smell. Gives you vibes of divinity. Could discern very good sandalwood, rose and incense smell with some woody notes. 

## Swastika - ‚Çπ1200   

Smells sweet with notes of Saffron. Has some woody notes. Lasts long and as is somewhat similar to Moksha

I am 32 y.o. and I want to start dating again for something serious. I am single many years, and I start feeling really lonely lately.

The last time I tried dating was in 2022 after covid. In a period of 6 months, I date 3 different girls with different backgrounds. I stopped seeing them after 2-3 dates for the same reason. All three of them had really strong political views and wanted to be with someone with the ""correct"" political views that agreed with them 24/7.

That made me stop trying and focusing on myself. I started studying for a masters degree. Having to work, study for my master and start learning a new language for a hobby, my free time, and especially my time to socialize went to zero.

Fast forward 2 years later, I finished my master and finally, I have again free time to socialize. While I was under the pressure of work and studying for my master I was happier than I'm now.

For about a month now after work, I just play video games, study Japanese for a second year, and go for walks after dinner. About myself I'm not an active person, I hate activities like gym, dancing, hiking or swimming but I like to go out for a simple walk. I'm not overweight, but I'm skinny with not enough muscles and look younger than I am. 

I know my hobbies aren't attractive to girls, and my body doesn't be athletic enough. It puts me at a disadvantage if I try online dating once again.

I understand that I have to change some things about myself, but I don't know what, and I don't have a reason to change since I'm single for so long. Lastly, I don't know where to look for a partner.

The only way for me is through online dating, I'm shy and I believe I creep a girl if I try to make a move to someone that I doesn't know in public or when she is with friends out at a bar or a coffee shop. 

I have friends and girl friends. I have asked a girl friend that is close to me and know her for years, if she has any friend that is looking for a relationship and told me she doesn't know any girl that suit me, they are to dumb or not a good fit for me. I didn't ask again because I just guessed she didn't want to help or genuinely she didn't have any friends.

So what should I try to change about me, and should I try the online dating again even though I believe it is a waste of time since I'm just an average guy ?",1,1736422505.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False
1hxauhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1hxauhb/did_i_really_cheat/,Did I really ‚Äúcheat‚Äù?,"To begin with‚Ä¶ I (33f) met my ex husband (36m) over six years ago. We met because I went to a job interview at where he worked. I am an attorney and back then, I was just starting to work. He is (we don‚Äôt have this title in my country but the only way I can discribe) a paralegal at the office I went to the interview. Long story short, the job didn‚Äôt work out for me but while I was there we spend alot of time together and started dating. He was great at first, he was the dream. But three months after we met, we needed to make a decision, we were dating for two months at this point. The decision being: him leaving the country for a new and unrelated job or we both move to his hometown to start a new office together. As I explained, I was a  new attorney and he had been working as a paralegal for over 5 years so together we could make it work.

We opted for the second choice and moved to his hometown, across the country and somehow, I found myself living with him and his bestfriend. They told me they promised eachother that they would go through this time together and living together is the essential step. (I know what you‚Äôre thinking and believe me, I also concidered the possibility but never saw anything, so I thought they were really, realllly best friends for life).

Things started going downhill from there. I was only 27, in a totally foreign culture (in my country where I am from and where we moved to is different from eachother like day and night culturally) and I knew nobody but him. He changed like somebody snapped a finger, that attentive, loving, caring guy who loved spending his time with me just vanished. He spend most of his time out, telling me he needed to remind his friends and social circle that he is back in town and they can come to us with any legal problems. But later I found out he was intruducing himself as an attorney too. I thought about going back but I moved there against all my families wishes so I couldn‚Äôt back down. I was always alone. When he was home (it was a homeoffice, so the house had two sections as you can imagine) he was either sitting in front of his computer, seemingly reading things (but I was the one who was writing and processing every legal document so‚Ä¶) or he was at his phone, spending his time away on youtube or something. We stopped having intimacy and it was triggering to me because I had a love language of physical touch and after we moved to his town our only physical contact was when being intimate. I was never sure if he loved me or not but whenever I tried having a conversation, he told me we should focus on work and after the office settled in we could start having fun again. I wasn‚Äôt asking for much either, drinking a coffee together while talking about our day, watching something together, any activity we both participate was enough for me tbh. But he said he can‚Äôt focus on a relationship while he was preoccupied with work.

So I waited. In the meantime we got married. Still sharing our home with his best friend. We were nearly skipping honeymoon because ‚Äúwe needed to work‚Äù but at that point I was seriously burnt out so he gave in and we went for a vacation, where I spent my time alone while he slept the days away. And the last couple of days, his best friend again joined us (yes in our honeymoon) and they started searching for car parts (his bsf had an accident where he wrecked his car totally)

We married Aug 2019. March 2020, the pandemic, as you all know. Where we forced to stay in but somehow managed to not communicate and drifted even far apart. I was desperate. I had my own mental problems so I needed his validation, approval, his love, IDK, I was pathetic. (Actually now I know he has Narcicistic PD and I am an empath with huge issues on setting boundries)

Whatever. I became pregnant at Dec2021 and his bsf only moved out when I was 5 months pregnant. (We lived together for approximately 30 months)

He never went back to his loving self. I self isolated. Stopped trying to communicate, instead I started therapy. Years went by like this. I was working my ass off, coming home to take care our daughter and he was never there. Not physically. Not mentally. He was always away. Always talking about how we have to work harder and stuff. I was fed up. Concidered divorcing him but couldn‚Äôt go with it because I was still hoping for things to get better.

Fast forward to Aug 2023. His brother was getting married so our anniversary was tossed out the window. At this point, he was always out of town, he was nearly never home and I was by myself, working at the office and taking care of our daughter.

Another attorney I had a case with at 2019 but kept in touch because we respected eachother and that was all, came to visit me at this time. He told me he always had a crush on me, he could see how unhappy I was in my marriage, how lonely I was, how tired I was etc etc. He was older and someone I respected greatly. Also he was telling me things I was so hungry to hear. But I kept my ground. We talked for three days and I never once said anything leading him on, us talking this regularly was the only thing out of ordinary. But even this disturbed me. At the end of third day, I texted him, telling him if it was a different life, if we were to meet under different circumstances we could have a shot and maybe we could have something beautiful. But I told him that I was married and eventhough I have a horrible husband he didn‚Äôt deserve this. 

When I think of the situation, where I may be in the wrong was, I didn‚Äôt block him. When I texted him saying no, he took it very well and we kept in touch, him asking me how I was doing occasionally and stuff. But as I mentioned, we were friends before all this so I didn‚Äôt think anything of it.

Things were at the worst in my marriage at this time. His so called bestfriend conned him out of millions. He was trying to work out some kind of revenge game but it was mostly him chasing his own tail. My husband was out of country most of the time, getting involved with mafia and stuff (absurd, I know) but it was like we were never married or never had any kind of relationship at any point. It was him against the world, he was always the only victim and I was full of it by then.

So I wasn‚Äôt as loving or as understanding as before. By then, we were in a so called relationship for over five years but I couldn‚Äôt remember the last time he called me something remotely nice. I was all alone so I couldn‚Äôt find it in me to love him as unconditionally anymore. Maybe I was already fallen out of love.

It was Dec2023. My behaviour irked him and he hacked my phone. I never deleted any convos because‚Ä¶ I mean, he wasn‚Äôt even looking at my direction and I wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong in particular. After snooping around he found the convo and all hell broke loose. 

It has been a year. Horrible things have happened since then. We eventually got divorced.

But somehow, all is on me. I was the one (from his POV) who cheated, destroyed something beautiful and he keeps playing victim, telling every listening soul how I cheated and betrayed him. 

Did I? What I did was not nice, I was tempted to make a mistake but I came back from it. He claims it was ‚Äúemotional cheating‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt even told the guy I liked him. I only liked the possibility of being loved in a different life. Not in this. And I acted accordingly.

Is it my fault? Am I the reason? Was what I did cheating?",0,1736422414.0,Marriage,0,0.5,False

Honestly no idea where to start with this or if this is even the right subreddit. I'm a 30 year old guy who has had a handful of first dates in his life and nothing beyond that. 

I feel like I have no reason to doubt myself. I work in tech, I am kinda fit and ran a marathon last year. Of course nothing like that entitles me to find or have someone. 

I have zero issues with rejection to the point where I can't even really relate to people being afraid of it. 

I have a positive outlook on life and am quite confident that I would eventually find someone, but I have basically zero confidence in that I could be liked at all while in the moment and I don't really trust myself in reading body language or picking up on little or subtle signs.

Generally speaking, I have a hard time feeling confident that someone who isnt already a friend could meet me and like me and the confidence I get from things like my career or hobbies seems to be reserved exclusively in those things but not actually give me more confidence about myself

Truth be told, I used to be absolutely awful at communocating my emotions during my teens and early to mid twenties, but close friends told me directly I have gotten better at it.

Not sure if this is relevant, but my politics are very left leaning and I despise the philosophies of morons like Andrew Tate.

I have a solid group of friends and we are somewhat active, go bouldering or other stuff. 

I joined a bookclub cause I got back into reading a lot more during the pandemic but feel a bit uncomfortable meeting women that way cause I assume that's not the purpose of it. 

I put myself out there in person and via dating apps and have been turned down like 5 times since New Years when asking for something like a coffee date.

My standards are honestly pretty low by now. 

I'm not trying to be a doomer about this or seek pity or feel like I have been treated unfairly, I just feel like in a very simple way I don't know what to do. I mean, the issue is obviously me.

I would appreciate the notion to maybe seek a therapist about this, but I am currently already on a waitlist. ",1,1736421544.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Fast-forward four hours later, and I‚Äôm sitting in my silent, eco-friendly chariot, staring at the dismal number on my Uber app: $33. That‚Äôs right. Thirty-three dollars. For four hours. In a Tesla. The irony wasn‚Äôt lost on me as I thought about how much electricity it cost to charge my car versus how little I‚Äôd made driving it.

One of my rides was a guy who spent the entire trip explaining how he would‚Äôve bought a Tesla if it weren‚Äôt for his ‚Äúother investments.‚Äù Another was a couple arguing over whether the seats in my car were real leather. Meanwhile, I was quietly wondering if anyone would notice if I unplugged their phone charger and pocketed it. Every ride was like a cosmic joke, and I was the punchline.

By the time I hit hour four, I‚Äôd accepted that I‚Äôd burned more electrons than I‚Äôd earned dollars. That‚Äôs when the thought hit me: What if I sold feet pics on OnlyFans?

1hxait2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hxait2/creating_a_cozy_outdoor_retreat_furniture_and/,Creating a Cozy Outdoor Retreat: Furniture and Decor Essentials,"Transforming your outdoor space into a cozy retreat doesn‚Äôt just enhance your home‚Äôs value but also provides a serene escape from daily life. Whether you have a sprawling garden, a compact balcony, or a cozy patio, the right furniture and decor can make all the difference. Here‚Äôs how to create a welcoming outdoor retreat with the perfect blend of comfort, style, and functionality.

# 1. Start with the Basics: Choosing the Right Outdoor Furniture

The foundation of any cozy outdoor retreat is the furniture. Durable, weather-resistant, and stylish options will ensure your space looks great and lasts through seasons.

* **Outdoor Garden Furniture:** For larger gardens, invest in a mix of seating options such as sectionals, loungers, and benches. Teak and aluminum furniture are excellent choices for durability, while cushioned pieces add comfort.
* **Balcony Furniture:** In smaller spaces like balconies, focus on compact designs such as foldable chairs, bistro sets, or wall-mounted tables. [Rattan furniture UAE](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/rattan) is a popular choice for balconies due to its lightweight design and chic aesthetic.

**Pro Tip:** Opt for neutral tones for furniture and add colorful cushions or throws to create a cozy yet stylish vibe.

# 2. Add a Touch of Elegance with Rattan Furniture

Rattan furniture is synonymous with outdoor living, offering a perfect blend of durability and sophistication. The natural, woven texture of rattan furniture UAE adds a rustic charm to any outdoor setting while being versatile enough to complement modern decor.

**Styling Idea:** Pair a rattan loveseat with a coffee table to create an intimate seating area. Add plush cushions and a throw blanket for a cozy finish.

# 3. Elevate Functionality with a Bar Cart

A [bar cart](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/bar-carts) is a must-have addition for outdoor entertaining. It not only adds style but also makes serving drinks and snacks effortless. Choose a sleek, weather-resistant cart with wheels for easy mobility.

**Outdoor Tip:** Use the bar cart to display a mix of beverages, glasses, and a small vase with fresh flowers or herbs for a decorative touch. It can also double as a plant stand or storage solution when not in use.

# 4. Layer with Textiles for Comfort

Add cozy vibes to your outdoor retreat with textiles. Outdoor rugs, cushions, and throws are essential for making the space feel warm and inviting. Look for weather-resistant materials that are easy to clean.

**Design Inspiration:** Place an outdoor rug under your seating arrangement to anchor the space. Choose patterns or colors that complement your [outdoor garden furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor) or balcony setup.

# 5. Create Ambiance with Lighting

Lighting plays a vital role in setting the mood of your outdoor retreat. String lights, lanterns, and solar-powered fixtures can add a magical glow to the space.

* Hang fairy lights across your balcony or pergola for a soft, whimsical feel.
* Use LED candles or lanterns around your rattan furniture UAE setup for a cozy evening vibe.

# 6. Decorate with Greenery

Nothing enhances the charm of an outdoor retreat like greenery. Incorporate potted plants, hanging planters, or vertical gardens to bring life to your space.

**Garden Idea:** Place planters with herbs, flowers, or succulents on your bar cart for a multi-functional and decorative setup.

# 7. Add Personal Touches

To make the space uniquely yours, add decor elements like wall art, sculptures, or wind chimes. A small fire pit or tabletop heater can extend the usability of your outdoor retreat into cooler months.

I'm big into craft beer so if there's a particular area to visit in Minneapolis which has a big concentration of breweries that would be great. 

Day 1- Fly into Minneapolis

Day 2- Potter around Minneapolis for the day.

Day 3 - Drive to Ely to check in with the outfitter

Day 4 - Set off on camping and canoeing trip

Day 5 - Camping

Day 6 - Camping

Day 7 - Get off the water and stay the night in Ely

Day 8- Check out Dorothy Molter museum in the morning and then head to Grand Marais to stay for a couple nights. I've seen there is the Splitrock Lighthouse down the Lake Superior coast. Is it worth visiting this? 

Day 9 - Hike Pincushion Mountain for the Lake Superior views. Although, and forgive me if this is a stupid question, is this a safe thing to do by myself? Is there potential to encounter bears, etc.? 

Day 10 - Drive to Duluth and hang out there for the day

Day 11 - White water rafting near Carlton

Day 12 - Drive to Minneapolis

Day 13 - Day in Minneapolis

Day 14 - Day in Minneapolis and potentially watching Minnesota United play if I can get tickets

Day 15 - Travel back to the UK

I (35m) live with my mom (64f) and our relationship is good, we disagree from time to time and in the past I've gotten angry enough to leave the house to sleep over at my friend's or sister's.

But we've been getting along great for the last few months especially, mainly because our sleep schedules are very different. With her being up from around 5am to 9-10pm while I go to bed around 5-9am until 1-3pm. We're both fine with this, she doesn't wake me up because I'm a heavy sleeper and use ear plugs. 

But lately I've wanted to try spending more time with her, or at least around her. 

I don't know if it's that I had a traumatic event happen in October (detained but not arrested, no charges pressed but I was severely mistreated by the cops and put in solitary with even more callous treatment from a social worker) and since then, my fight or flight is extra sensitive and even when my mom has done *nothing* to upset me, the second she gets up from her sleep I feel the massive urge to hole myself in my room. And I'm frankly so sick of my room. I want to write and watch TV with my mom. But it's like any noise she makes aggregates me. And I'm acutely aware that this is stuff that usually doesn't get to me. 

Mundane little things like turning on the coffee maker, or the stove fan, or talking to me aggregates me. And because she's done nothing wrong, not even a little, I immediately feel guilty on top of this annoyance.

I've tried increasing my THC intake but my tolerance for it is so high that it barely helps. Besides forcing myself to be in the same room as her until it stops bothering me, I am at a total loss on what to do. 

She was supportive during my traumatic event, and is supportive and willing to help any way she can. But I can't exactly say ""stop doing your normal daily routines they bother me"" because that's both unfair and ridiculous. ",2,1736420556.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

\- the oil used is of poor quality and will be reused for multiple dishes because its cheap  
\- the sugar content in coffee and others is high because this shows more people prefer these kinds of dishes.  
\- There is no separation of vegetarian and meat food and the person uses the same hands for multiple dishes. this was the most disturbing point for me after visiting 3 dark stores where cafe is  
\- even zepto employees have raised concerns but because of speed and unit economics these concerns are not a priority. focus is on cheap prices and speedy delivery only  
\- food is all frozen which is alright but handling and pressure on people in store means dirty hands and the person uses the same hands for multiple products including waste food and touching dirty carton boxes raw produce in some cases and is really bad

You promised me time.  You promised me our lives together.  You told me that I had never been loved before, and that you'd show me.  You told me that all of my dreams would come true.  I tried to believe you.

# Tips for Japan üáØüáµ

## Travel Stuff
- **Coin Purse:** Coins are used for a lot of things, so having a small coin purse makes life easier.
- **Cash & Cards:** Most places take cards, but smaller shops or street vendors might only take cash. Better to have both.
- **Bullet Train:** You‚Äôll need two tickets (regular + express) for the Shinkansen. It‚Äôs easier to buy them at the station desk. Trains come every 10 minutes, so you won‚Äôt have to wait long.
- **Tipping:** It‚Äôs not a thing in Japan and can even be seen as rude. Just pay the bill as it is.
- **Trash Cans:** They‚Äôre super rare in public spaces, so it‚Äôs a good idea to carry a small trash bag with you.
- **Hotels:** Japanese hotels usually provide a lot of stuff‚Äîpajamas, toothbrushes, razors, slippers‚Äîso you can pack light.
- **Data:** I used Revolut for an eSIM. It worked great for data, and the platinum program gives you travel insurance and airport lounge access too.
- **Transport Apps:** Uber and GoTaxi are available, making it easy to get around.
- **Etiquette:**
  - Don‚Äôt eat or smoke while walking. There are designated smoking areas, and eating is better done in a proper spot.

Lately I got the Epic Intra by Peak as it was on sale and cheaper. I take it before I do exhausting garden work, demolition and renovations at our house etc. 

On a very hot late August day I remodeled a place in our garden and planted some plants etc. It was hard work with hot weather and sun all the time, for 6-7 hours without a break. At that time I felt already a bit weak and burned out due to my job and mobbing. But that work in the garden had to be done and it looked great afterwards. I was happy.

I am really surprised how much energy it gives me. Even that I don't work out or go to the gym 3x a week I had the energy and endurance for digging holes, carrying soil the whole day. Only workout are renovations, demo and the garden work in the past months.

What is in there that has this effect? Why are amino acids helpful?

I just bought a cafelat robot and I'm using pre-ground coffee from the supermarket (Pellini Top 100% Arabica) with the pressurized basket, it doesn't reach the necessary pressure (less than 4 bars) and it comes out too strong (too much acidity) which didn't happen when using reusable capsules with a Nesspresso, I see that I have to invest in a grinder to grind the coffee adapted to the robot and I have a budget of around 220‚Ç¨, I live in Europe (Spain) and both the Miicoffee d40+ model (220‚Ç¨) and the Eureka mignon manuale (210‚Ç¨) meet that budget.

For design and silence I like the MiiCoffee more, but for power and construction I like the Eureka more. I also don't know what differences I can get from grinding with 40mm conical blades vs. 50mm flat blades, since now the supermarket coffee I'm using in the Cafelat robot is strong, I would like the grinder to give softer notes and a large coffee foam.

what do you recommend me?

NOTE: As far as I know the Micoffee d40+ is the same as the Turin SK40

Old Nice, or *Vieux Nice*, isn't just a place; it's an experience.  Cobblestone streets wind through a labyrinth of colorful buildings, each corner revealing a hidden gem.  Forget the tourist traps ‚Äì this walking tour will guide you through the heart of Nice's authentic charm.

**Getting Started: Cours Saleya Market**

Your journey begins at Cours Saleya Market, a vibrant hub of activity.  Whether you're visiting in the morning, surrounded by the fragrant bounty of fresh produce, flowers, and spices, or in the evening, enjoying the lively atmosphere of the night market, it's a sensory feast.  Take your time, soak it all in, and maybe grab a delicious pastry from a nearby boulangerie.

**Down the Narrow Streets: A Sensory Adventure**

From Cours Saleya, wander down the narrow, winding streets ‚Äì the *ruelles* ‚Äì of Vieux Nice.  Notice the pastel-colored buildings, a signature feature of the old town.  These aren't just pretty facades; they tell a story of history and resilience.  The vibrant colors protect the buildings from the intense Mediterranean sun.  Look up, down, and all around ‚Äì you'll discover charming doorways, hidden courtyards, and tiny shops selling everything from local crafts to artisanal soaps.

**A Taste of History: Place Rossetti & Palais Lascaris**

Head towards Place Rossetti, the heart of Old Nice, dominated by the beautiful Baroque church of Sainte-R√©parate.  Take a moment to admire its elegant architecture.  Nearby, explore the Palais Lascaris, a magnificent 17th-century palace showcasing lavish interiors and exquisite collections of paintings and furniture.  (Check opening times beforehand!)

**Hidden Gems & Local Flavors:**

Get lost!  (Figuratively, of course.  Keep your phone handy for navigation, just in case.) That's the best way to truly appreciate Vieux Nice.  Venture down alleyways you wouldn't normally consider. You'll find charming little squares perfect for a coffee break, independent boutiques brimming with unique treasures, and local restaurants serving authentic Ni√ßoise cuisine.  Don't be afraid to try something new ‚Äì you might discover your new favorite dish!

**The Castle Hill Viewpoint:**

For a breathtaking panoramic view of the city, climb up to Castle Hill (Colline du Ch√¢teau).  You can take the elevator or walk up ‚Äì the choice is yours!  The view from the top is simply unforgettable.  On a clear day, you can see the coastline stretching as far as the eye can see.

**Finishing Your Tour:**

As the sun sets, casting a warm glow on the pastel buildings, take a final stroll through the quieter streets.  Enjoy the tranquility after a day exploring this magical place.  Perhaps grab a final drink at a charming bar before heading back to your accommodation.

**Tips for Your Walking Tour:**

* **Wear comfortable shoes:** You'll be doing a lot of walking on cobblestones.
* **Bring water:** Especially during the warmer months.
* **Check opening times:**  For museums and attractions.
* **Get lost:**  Allow yourself to wander and discover the hidden gems.
* **Enjoy the moment:** Soak up the atmosphere and embrace the charm of Old Nice.


Your walking tour of Old Nice is an unforgettable journey through history, culture, and stunning beauty. Enjoy!

i always wondered if something as perfect as stimulants existed to make me feel this focused and stimulated ; something that i could take everyday without risking my life ; i talked about it with my adhd friends and they told me about their medication. so i tried 60mg of methyl that i friend gave me (don't do that once again) and i felt incredibly functional and normal, it worked wonder on me. 

i started drinking coffee few days ago, i feel a bit more functional but the depression is still. but stimulants seem to work perfectly good on me 

one night where i was coked up as usual, i chatted with a random redditor, diagnosed adhd, that went through the same thing as me about depression and stuff. he made me realize that it is clearly not normal that i have to abuse stimulants in order to function. i know about adhd, i have adhd friends, and i've always been told that i'm not because i didn't have the clich√© turbulent childhood behavior but anyways, i knew that adhd could lead to a depression but my psychiatrists also always told me that i wasn't adhd, and all my symptoms were depression.

then, i talked to my psychiatrist about the self medication and substance abuse part and he confirmed me that this is a clear sign of adhd and it wasn't normal: so i'm currently being diagnosed, did the dsm 5 tests (the diva one, i live in france) which came back very positive and i've got an appointment by the end of the month so i'll have a prescription for health exams before medication. 

  
i couldn't hide my excitation ; i felt relieved, almost had tears of joy, i told myself, finally 5 years of suffering and rotting in bed will be over, i will feel normal again. but a friend brought my feet back on the ground and told me that adhd medication didn't cure her depression. i felt devastated ; i'm scared, i know i'm having high expectations on this treatment but what if it doesn't work on my depression ? antidepressants and mood regulators already don't work, what will i do ????!!! thanks ",3,1736419777.0,adhdwomen,3,0.8,False

1hxa3ce,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1hxa3ce/rugs_for_small_spaces_maximizing_style_in_compact/,Rugs for Small Spaces: Maximizing Style in Compact Areas,"Decorating a small space comes with its unique challenges, but the right rug can be a game-changer. Rugs not only add warmth and style but also create the illusion of a larger, more cohesive room. Whether you‚Äôre styling a cozy living room, a compact bedroom, or a snug office, here‚Äôs how to use rugs effectively to maximize style and functionality in small spaces.

# 1. The Power of Patterns and Colors in Small Spaces

Choosing the right rug for a small room involves balancing colors, patterns, and textures to enhance the space without overwhelming it.

* **Black and White Carpet:** Bold patterns, like a [black and white carpet](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/black-and-white-rug), can make a dramatic statement without cluttering the space. These carpets add a modern edge and are perfect for creating a focal point in a living room or office.
* **White Rug:** A [white rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/black-and-white-rug) can open up a small space, giving it an airy and spacious feel. It‚Äôs a great choice for bedrooms or minimalistic living rooms. Pair it with colorful accents like throw pillows or art to add personality.
* **Grey Rugs for Living Room:** Neutral tones like [grey rugs for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/etienne-rug-grey) work wonders in compact areas. Grey is versatile, blending seamlessly with most color schemes while adding depth and sophistication to your decor.

# 2. Using Rugs to Define Zones in Open Layouts

In small spaces, rugs can define zones, especially in open-plan layouts. For example:

* Use a grey rug for the living room to delineate the seating area from the dining or workspace.
* In studio apartments, a black and white carpet can separate the sleeping area from the rest of the room, creating a visually distinct zone.

# 3. Bedroom Rugs: Adding Comfort and Style

In compact bedrooms, rugs bring a sense of coziness while enhancing the decor. Here‚Äôs how to style them:

* Place a **white rug** under the bed, extending slightly on all sides to frame the bed and create a luxurious feel.
* Opt for runners or smaller [bedroom rugs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) along the sides of the bed for a soft landing when you wake up.
* If your bedroom has darker furniture, a black and white carpet can add contrast and modern flair.

# 4. Choosing the Right Rug Size for Small Spaces

The size of the rug plays a crucial role in small spaces. Rugs that are too small can make a room feel disjointed, while oversized ones may overpower the space.

* **Living Room:** A grey rug for the living room should fit comfortably under your coffee table and at least the front legs of your furniture to tie the seating area together.
* **Bedroom:** A smaller bedroom rug or a runner can add warmth without overcrowding the space.

# 5. Rug Materials for Small Spaces

When selecting a rug for a compact area, consider materials that are easy to maintain and complement your lifestyle:

* **Synthetic Rugs:** Affordable and durable, ideal for high-traffic spaces like living rooms or hallways.
* **Wool Rugs:** Soft and cozy, perfect for bedrooms or sitting areas.
* **Flatweave Rugs:** Lightweight and versatile, these are great for layering or using in spaces where you need easy cleaning.

# 6. Layering Rugs for Added Texture

Layering rugs is a great way to add texture and dimension to small spaces. For example, layer a white rug over a larger neutral base or place a black and white carpet on top of a jute rug for a bohemian vibe.

# 7. Tips to Maximize Space with Rugs

* **Go Round:** In tight spaces, round rugs can create the illusion of more room by softening corners and drawing the eye outward.
* **Light Colors:** Lighter hues like whites and greys can make a room feel larger and brighter.
* **Patterns and Geometry:** Opt for rugs with simple geometric patterns to add visual interest without overwhelming the room.

**Final Thoughts**

Small spaces deserve just as much style as larger ones, and the right rug can make all the difference. Whether you opt for a bold black and white carpet, a soft white rug, or chic grey rugs for living rooms, the key is to choose pieces that complement your space while reflecting your personal style. Don‚Äôt forget to consider bedroom rugs for added comfort and charm in your sleeping area.

Keeping a daily routine and serving others can help alleviate loneliness after the loss of a loved one. We have suggestions for overcoming loneliness, particularly for older adults.

1. Be honest about your feelings.
Don‚Äôt sugarcoat your emotions with God, yourself or others. God wants you to share your struggles with him. When you express your feelings with family, friends and caregivers, that‚Äôs when they can help you. David‚Äôs openness was evident in Psalm 42 when he asked himself, ‚ÄúWhy, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?‚Äù

2. Practice positive self-talk.
Start your day with encouraging thoughts and tell yourself you‚Äôre not going to sit at home again. Plan to call your friends and schedule a coffee gathering or a walk to decrease social isolation. Then take the initiative and do it. Many friends will gladly accept your invitation.

3. Continue doing what‚Äôs meaningful.
It might seem easier to withdraw if you can‚Äôt physically do what you used to be able to do. Dial back the intensity as needed, but maintain some version of your routine, doing whatever gives your life structure and meaning. That might mean taking a daily walk, attending a worship service or seeing a friend for some social interaction. Consider getting a pet since they make great company and can help you be more active.

4. Get with God every day.
Recent studies suggest that faith protects against loneliness: Partly it‚Äôs the social network that a church or synagogue provides, and partly it‚Äôs the sense of connection to God. Don‚Äôt forget to seek wisdom in Scripture. For comfort and strength when you‚Äôre lonely, read these Bible verses: Psalm 37:23-25, Psalm 68:5-6, Isaiah 26:3, Deuteronomy 31:6 and 1 Peter 5:7.

5. Do something for someone else.
Research shows that doing good helps us feel better. There are simple things you can do, such as inviting a neighbor over for coffee or baking something for a friend. If you‚Äôre looking to do more, many places need volunteers. Search community websites or check with your church or local library. A benefit of many volunteer opportunities is they often don‚Äôt require money or special skills; just willingness and time.",1,1736419143.0,loneliness,0,1.0,False

1hxa1gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/NARWAL/comments/1hxa1gl/underwhelming/,Underwhelming,"I have my Freo X Ultra now for more then a half year and had the ""Pleasure"" to test it out more then I wanted.

It feels like these things are designed for small spaces with nothing in it, as the designers didn't think about how much fun it would be to move your furniture around, while this stupid thing makes it erratic first mapping. 

I want to tell the thing: Map this room and then we go to that room, but NO that robot has it's own mind (sadly it seems more like braindamaged badly). And what a joy, if it resets in the middle of the mapping process... It really does to like to restart...

We have a staircase in the middle of the house and don't you think the software would be equipped for such a thing. Nope! I followed all the instructions by the friendly but really not helpful support Sharon and it really doesn't work, instead of what Sharon stated.

The robot recognizes my walled up staircase at first just fine, but in the end it decides that it just can't be, that there is a room in the middle of other rooms and it makes one big room out of it. Thanks a bunch!

So off to declaring a forbidden zone, what's just a pleasure to do with that clunky software, just like splitting rooms, what you can only do passable if that stupid robot KEEPS the walls in the mapping...

But on the bright side: It recoginizes and KEEPS not existing walls just fine! Like around my cupboard, which is so high, that it can easily drive under, but after the last remapping I had to do, it just decided that it has 3 walls around it. At least it left one side open, so it still is willing to clean under it somewhat...

Then after reading that I really have to use FREO-Modus, if I want it to clean my corners, I just tested that out and tada, it doesn't clean the corners. It doesn't even try! And yes, I activated ALWAYS clean corners. I followed the robot around and besides from not even trying, I had the impression it couldn't even IF it tried, as I don't see, how it should reach inside the corner if there is no side brush, which can be moved out, like some other brands have.

Dirt AI? What a laugh. I can watch this thing so often drive happily right next to entire bunches of my pets hairs and it ignores them obstinately. It usually moves them around just fine, but I want it to eat them up and not shove them out of the way.

Sadly, if you look at tests for other robots like Roborock and such, no one goes in depth about such stuff. How simple and comfortable is the mapping process, what about the software. Does it clean corners really well? Nope, they tell you how good they suck in corn. Great.

Or how some robot recognizes the coffee splash on the floor and mops it up right away, only that it doesn't clean the mops afterwards, but hey, that's just some small issue, right?

20 (?) years of robots and that is all they came up with?

I did everything right, I drank one coffee in the past month and a glass of wine on new years eve, I peed after sex, I showered regularly I drank enough water, yet here I am again with that annoying burning feeling. 

I am so done with this shit. Just because my urethra is shorter I have to go through pain and sleepless nights for up to a week nearly every second month and stuff myself with antibiotics that only help with the current infection but have no way of preventing another one. I am done, I am tired, I'd rather have my bladder and urethra operated out of my body than have to go through this again.

I am so mad because I feel so helpless at this point because whatever I do I still end up sick again. Not to mention I am supposed to write an exam next week so yay to studying while being tired and in pain and than going to write an exam while needing to pee every 10 minutes.

Fuck this shit, seriuosly. And also all the stigma that comes with this infection is baffling. So many people will think you are unhygienic, dirty or whatever when you tell them you get regular utis. It's so annoying having to explain to people that I in fact do shower and wipe front to back yet I still get these infections. 

And than there is the people who are trying to help and most of the time mean well, telling you ""oh just take cranberry extract, just drink 100% cranberry juice, just take these vitamins."" I did and it did not do anything, I still get sick, my infections are still as painfull and last as long as they did before unless I take antibiotics. I know they mean well, but listening to the same advice again and again and again while knowing you did all of that and it did nothing is just so fucking tiring.

1hx9zjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xreal/comments/1hx9zjl/using_xreal_one_for_workingcitrix_display_as_a/,Using XReal One for working/Citrix display as a digital nomad,"For over 4 years I'm working as a digital nomad while traveling through the world. I'm working as a freelanced software developer and the screen is alway to small. Especially when you live on a boat or a motor home like me. There is just no space for a huge monitor. Several years ago I heard about the NReal but the reviews where to bad when using them as a workstation monitor. That changed with the XReal One and so i gave it a try... Spoiler: I'm impressed and don't want to go back. Here some facts about me and (more important) my eyes:

I'm 56 years old. Normally I use reading glasses for working on the Laptop. My dioptrin is +1.25 for reading and -0.75 for far distance viewing. My IDP is 70mm. 

About the quality and usability there are a lot of reports here that I can fully support. The resolution is good enough to work with it even in IntelliJ or VSC. There are some minor issues like reflections but that's also the case on any other monitor operating in bright light. The XReal One can surely not compete with a 4k Ultra-Wide curved Monitor. But that's comparing apples with oranges.

The only thing I really recognise is a flicker on high contrast thin lines like switching IntelliJ to dark mode. That's something I just can't use. But since the screen inside the glasses does not have to compete with the sun I don't really need the dark mode anymore.

So what are my experiences with the XReal One especialy when it comes to work local and remote via Citrix Workstation:

\* Working in bright shiny daylight  
That was alway an issue with the notebooks. Even my wife with her MacBook Pro M1, which has a much brighter display than mine, was struggling with the sun. With the XReal it is realy possible as long as you do not look directly into the sun. 

\* Reading Glasses:  
On my first day i tried them with contact lenses because I thought I had to wear them as I do when I work on my Laptop. But that was a bad Idea for me. The display of the XReal is so far away (optically) that I don't need the +1.25. The next day I used them without any correction and that's perfect. So If you are using glasses on you PC try it without and ""have a look""

\* IDP  
My IDP is 70mm and I put the IDP-Parameter to +3. I do not really notice any change but that's how it is now.

\* Social Isolation  
Putting the XReal in dark mode makes you unable to see anything behind you glasses. So when I'm sitting on the table next to my wife I can not see her. Something you must get used to it. My current solution is to put the glasses on the lowest darkness so my wife looks like a (very pretty) reflection on my screen. When the sun is bright and shiny I'm sorry to put the glasses into dark mode.

\* Mobility  
You can not jump up and make a coffee! I put the glasses into transparent mode, put them from the face and make the coffee. In transparent mode they can cool down a little. (Not that they are getting to hot! Don't get me wrong. But it's just ...)

\*Magnetic Connectors  
I bought magnetic USB-C connectors to prevent the glasses from falling of when someone (like me) pulls the cable. But I shows, that this is not a good Idea. The good thing: You can't strip the glasses from the face by pulling the cable. The bad thing: You touch the cable to often and than you have to re arrange all your windows.

\* Sleep Mode  
I turned it off because once they got into sleep mode you have to wake them up  and rearrange all you windows. Better to put them in transparent mode.

\* Working with macOS   
My notebook is a MacBook pro from 2019 (last Intel Book) running latest Sequia. It works directly without any major issues. Sequia seems to have a problem with the dock, when the XReal screen is arranged above the laptop screen. It is not possible (or I didn't find out how) to place the dock on the XReal screen. It is alway on the lower screen. (Yes I activated ""Monitors have differen spaces"" switch and logged in again).   
  
I currently using only the XReal and than the dock is where I want it to be. The MacBook lays closed on a side desk and does not occupy any space on the very small motor home table. Very nice! My only elements on the desk are a Bluetooth Keyboard and the Mouse. 

\* Working with Citrix Workstation on MacOS  
Under macOS it works pretty seamlessly and I don't have any issues. To me the windows desktop does not look as good as the Mac Desktop. Mostly colored text is sometimes a little wired. Green text on white background starts yellow and get's green at the end of a word. This is only in the Citrix Desktop. Not on the Mac Desktop.

\* Working with Citrix Workstation on iPad Pro (A12 Processor)  
The iPad Pros prior to M1 do not support larger Desktops when an external Display like the XReal is connected. So I expected to get pretty black frame around the Citrix Workspace window. But I was wrong! Citrix on iPad pro with A12 (4th generation I think) uses the full native screen of the XReal. So it is a very usable Citrix platform. Sadly the ultrawide mode is not supported. (Or I just didn't find out how)

So all together I'm more than pleased with the XReal One and can highly recommend them as a display device when you have limited space. All you need is a place for you closed notebook next to you and a table for you keyboard and mouse.

Hey fellow home enthusiasts!

So, I‚Äôve been reimagining my living room lately, channeling my inner interior decorator, and I have stumbled across a surprisingly puzzling question: Just how big should a coffee table be? You‚Äôd think such a central piece of furniture would have a straightforward answer, but oh, the rabbit hole is deep, folks!

Picture this: You‚Äôre in a beautifully curated living room. The light is just right, the couch looks inviting, and bam, there‚Äôs this coffee table that either feels too large‚Äîlike it could double as a lunch table at a caf√©‚Äîor too small, making you question if it‚Äôs just decorative. Striking the balance in coffee table dimensions can be as tricky as finding a needle in a haystack.

From what I‚Äôve gathered (and experienced), the rule of thumb seems to suggest that the length of your coffee table should be about two-thirds the length of your couch. I personally find this ratio appealing as it tends to provide enough surface space for your home essentials like remote controls, magazines, and let‚Äôs be honest, snacks, without overwhelming the room. Plus, maintaining at least 18 inches between the table and the sofa is key for easy maneuverability‚ÄîI‚Äôm clumsy enough without turning my living room into an obstacle course!

Then there‚Äôs the height factor‚Äîideally, the table should be no more than one to two inches lower than the seat of the couch. I once had a coffee table that was quite a bit lower, and while it looked chic, reaching down felt like I was doing crunches every time I wanted to grab a cup of coffee (fitness and decor, anyone?). Now, I prioritize comfort over trend‚Äîno judgment if your experience has been the opposite!

What about shapes, though? I‚Äôve always found round tables to create a soft, inviting feel, especially when you have kiddos running around. They seem to make space flow, promoting conversation and reducing the danger of sharp-corner-induced boo-boos. However, a rectangular table often feels more traditional and can anchor a room beautifully if you have the space.

All of these factors do depend on the overall vibe you‚Äôre going for‚Äîand I suppose there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all answer. Ultimately, your coffee table should cater to your lifestyle and aesthetic preferences. After all, who doesn‚Äôt adore a living space that screams ‚Äúyou‚Äù?

I‚Äôd love to hear your take! How did you decide on your coffee table size? Did you have any design epiphanies or missteps I can learn from? Drop your thoughts, experiences, or even your current coffee table dilemmas in the comments. Let‚Äôs brew this conversation up to perfection! ‚òïÔ∏èüõãÔ∏è

1hx9xzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/comments/1hx9xzj/why_i_think_programming_is_great_for_adhd/,Why I think programming is great for ADHD,"Hello! Random stranger on the internet here. Another developer friend of mine pointed out that there's a good chance I have ADHD based on some of the things I do. He pointed it out when I mentioned I drink butter coffee. I always thought that I might but never really thought much of it until I heard the same questions about if I have ADHD pop up from my mentor, and then from my relationship partner.

Disclosure: I haven't been officially diagnosed yet (just haven't gone), but I can tell you that on most ADHD checklists I tick many boxes and on days without coffee I typically am not in a place where I can think clearly and work effectively.

Anyways, one of my features is that I really don't like repetitive tasks. When I started programming another mentor of mine suggested it based on how my brain works. 

I like how with automation you can just build something once (when you can get yourself to focus on it long enough) and then it more or less just works.

It's convenient that it's a skill that gives you additional time once you finally automate something.

It's like working with daily routines to keep getting the results you want or similar.

Anyways, just a thought post and wondering if others feel the same way. I am caffeinated right now and it's the only way I was able to write this post instead of coding on my project üòÇ Impulsive idea and striking while the iron's hot. Ok enough of a break.

So, I recently found myself in the middle of a small-space conundrum while redecorating my living room and thought it would be a great topic to bring up here. Let's talk about coffee tables ‚Äì specifically, what's the best shape for tight spaces? I know this might sound a bit niche, but if you're living in a cozy apartment or a tiny home, figuring out the right furniture can make the difference between a cramped space and a cozy haven.

I‚Äôve always loved those Pinterest-perfect rooms where everything seems to fit together like a puzzle, even when the room‚Äôs hardly bigger than a shoebox. My own experience taught me that the shape of your coffee table plays a key role in maximizing functionality and aesthetic appeal in smaller spaces. Crazy, right? But trust me, it makes a difference!

Round tables are my go-to for small spaces. There's something about the curve which makes a room feel inviting and open. Plus, without corners, you won't be painfully reminded of your tight space every time you bump into them. I‚Äôve found that round tables are perfect for high-traffic areas because they allow easy navigation around the room, and they seem less visually intrusive.

On the other hand, I‚Äôve had friends swear by the versatility of square or rectangular tables. They argue that these shapes can hug walls or fit snugly at the end of a sofa, and can often double as storage units with shelves underneath. Oh, and let's not forget the trendy nesting tables! These little guys allow you to adjust your table space as needed and are a lifesaver when you're hosting guests in a small area.

Then there‚Äôs the wildcard: the multi-level or abstract-shaped tables. I haven‚Äôt personally tried these, but I can see how they could add a unique touch and maybe even serve as an interesting conversation starter. With their sculptural designs, they can definitely make a statement while providing functional surface area.

What about you guys? How do you navigate the small space challenge? Do you have any favorite coffee table shapes or layouts that have worked wonders for you? Share your experiences, tips, or even your cautionary tales in the comments. I‚Äôd love to hear how others are making the most out of their cozy spots!

I hope your day is as cozy as a well-loved living room. So, today I found myself in the midst of yet another furniture rearrangement saga‚ÄîI swear, at this rate, my furniture will get more exercise than I do! As I stood there, contemplating the perfect placement for my seemingly oversized coffee table, I thought: How big should your coffee table really be compared to your couch?

This question might sound simple, but it‚Äôs one of those little details that can make a big difference in how our living spaces look and feel. After diving into the rabbit hole of interior design advice (because isn't that what any good procrastinator does?), I learned some interesting tidbits that I thought I‚Äôd share.

First off, most decorators agree that your coffee table should be about two-thirds the length of your couch. This tends to keep the space visually balanced and ensures that everyone on the couch has easy access to it (no awkward stretching and spilling your popcorn everywhere during a movie night). The height is also key‚Äîideally, it should be the same height as the seat cushions on your couch or an inch or two lower, creating a smooth and cohesive look.

Personally, I used to think bigger was better. ""More surface area equals more space for snacks, right?"" But after inadvertently stubbing my toe on a massive table one too many times, I‚Äôve come to appreciate a more modest size. Plus, when I downsized my table, my living room magically felt more spacious‚Äîsmall changes can have such a big impact!

One thing I find fascinating is how diverse coffee tables can be. Whether it's a rustic wooden piece that adds warmth or a sleek glass design that brings a touch of modernity, your coffee table is kind of like the punctuation mark of your living room‚Äîit can really set the tone. A friend of mine even uses an ottoman as a coffee table, pairing it with a chic tray to keep things on top stable. It's a great space-saving hack that adds an extra layer of style and utility.

I'm curious‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your take on finding the perfect coffee table size? Do you have any decorating hacks or personal preferences when it comes to making your living room feel just right? Share your thoughts, experiences, or those times your coffee table held something unexpected (I once found my cat sleeping on mine!) in the comments below. Let‚Äôs swap stories and tips!

Let me be real with you: implementing these changes wasn't smooth sailing. There were days I fell back into old patterns, moments of frustration, and times I questioned if it was worth it. But looking back now, these strategies fundamentally changed how I approach life and productivity.

Here's what actually worked for me:

* Morning Sanctuary: I replaced the instant phone grab with 30 minutes of peace. Just water, window gazing, and letting my mind settle. The first week was torture ‚Äì my hand would literally twitch toward my phone. Now? It's the most peaceful part of my day. The urge to check notifications eventually fades, I promise.

* Movement Medicine: Skip the intense workout pressure. I discovered that simple movement ‚Äì like walking without podcasts or dancing badly while making breakfast ‚Äì gives me a more sustainable dopamine boost than endless doomless scrolling ever did. Your body literally rewards you for basic movement, no gym membership required.

* Real Connection Reset: Having coffee with friends, phones face-down, felt weirdly uncomfortable at first. Those silent moments where we'd usually hide in our screens? They turned into the deepest conversations I've had in years. The human connection hits different when you're fully present.

* Analog Joy: Found myself picking up origami (of all things). There's something deeply satisfying about creating something physical with your hands. Whether it's drawing, writing in a journal, or building something ‚Äì tangible activities give you that dopamine hit without the digital drain.

* Single-Task Revolution: Turns out, my brain wasn't designed for constant task-switching. When I work, I just work. When I rest, I actually rest (revolutionary, I know). It felt impossible at first, but like training a puppy, my mind gradually learned to stay focused.

* Evening Rituals: Created a proper shutdown sequence for my day instead of streaming until my eyes blur. Sometimes it's reading an actual book, sometimes just sitting with my thoughts. My sleep quality skyrocketed, and morning-me is way less grumpy.

Here's the real talk: this isn't about becoming some digital monk or never enjoying Netflix again. I still use technology, but now I'm in control, not the other way around. Some days are better than others, and that's completely okay.

Remember, these changes took months, not days. Start small, be patient with yourself, and know that every tiny victory counts.

Drop a comment about which strategy you're going to try first ‚Äì let's keep supporting each other on this journey.

Long story short, I've been helping my mother through quite a number of health scares since November 2024. Feel free to check out the previous posts on my profile to know all the details.

I want to sort of rant about something that has happened twice now: the period right after the crisis is presumed to be over.

I'm the youngest of three siblings who all live in the family home with mom. I'm the primary caregiver. But annoyingly, I'm also the only one who takes action when there's any kind of a crisis in this house, whether it's regarding the plumbing or mom's health.

Once the crisis is over, I find myself sitting on my front porch drinking coffee and smoking a cigar (if i have one), and just looking around gathering my thoughts. I feel like I had just been through a firefight, broken, traumatized, tired, knowing that my body will still be on high alert for at least another week until my subconscious is convinced that the danger is over.

But my siblings.

They instantly go back to their normal lives.

My sister, the high-flying corporate executive and socialite, immediately goes back to her habits. During the crisis, sure, she'll come home right after work and be close to mom, maybe even clean the house a little. But as soon as the crisis is over she's out all day and treating the home like a hotel again.

My brother, well. He's the older brother I grew up being told was the brave one, the street smart guy, the fighter. He's nowhere to be found pre-, mid-, or post-crisis.

Let me just give you a simple example: last Friday, I had to trick my mom into going to the hospital emergency room where she got blood tests and an MRI. The next morning, we were back there to see her primary care doctor.

My brother went fishing.

Saturday, after meeting the doctor and coming home, I found the fish he caught in the freezer.

I stood there shaking my head.

It's so surreal.

Here I am, a grown man, crying and apologizing to my mother for putting her through the stress of visiting the emergency room at hospital and then following up with various specialists (because I deemed it necessary to make sure she was okay) and this... gentleman... was fishing.

And I know my sister well. She's the type that'll just go back to her usual antics the moment that initial danger/fear/anxiety wears off. And boy does it wear off quickly for her.

Things have been peaceful for the past two days and, touch wood, I think the worst is over. But I'm still sitting on the front porch with my coffee, probably with a thousand-yard stare in my eye or whatever.

I'm not looking for advice. I think I know what advice you'd give, and you know I'd probably give the same advice to you if you were in my position.

I just needed to vent this to people who'd understand.

* Real Connection Reset: Having coffee with friends, phones face-down, felt weirdly uncomfortable at first. Those silent moments where we'd usually hide in our screens? They turned into the deepest conversations I've had in years. The human connection hits different when you're fully present.

* Analog Joy: Found myself picking up origami (of all things). There's something deeply satisfying about creating something physical with your hands. Whether it's drawing, writing in a journal, or building something ‚Äì tangible activities give you that dopamine hit without the digital drain.

* Single-Task Revolution: Turns out, my brain wasn't designed for constant task-switching. When I work, I just work. When I rest, I actually rest (revolutionary, I know). It felt impossible at first, but like training a puppy, my mind gradually learned to stay focused.

* Evening Rituals: Created a proper shutdown sequence for my day instead of streaming until my eyes blur. Sometimes it's reading an actual book, sometimes just sitting with my thoughts. My sleep quality skyrocketed, and morning-me is way less grumpy.

Here's the real talk: this isn't about becoming some digital monk or never enjoying Netflix again. I still use technology, but now I'm in control, not the other way around. Some days are better than others, and that's completely okay.

Remember, these changes took months, not days. Start small, be patient with yourself, and know that every tiny victory counts.

Drop a comment about which strategy you're going to try first ‚Äì let's keep supporting each other on this journey.

Edit: Since some of you asked ‚Äì yes, this is all from personal experience. The struggles, the setbacks, and the small wins are all real. Thanks for creating this space where we can have honest conversations about something we all face.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",11,1736418343.0,Procrastinationism,0,0.93,False
1hx9vhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1hx9vhd/mother_assaulted_by_person_in_group_home_what/,Mother assaulted by person in group home. What legal recourse? (NY),"Yesterday my mother and another person were assaulted by someone from a group home for people with intellectual disabilities around the block from her. My mother is physically disabled, she often has him over to pay him for yard or household services or just to make him food and have company.

 Him and the other person assaulted were in the livingroom sweeping. My mother was in the kitchen making them all food. He was asked to hold a dustpan while the other person swept and proceeded to crack him over the head with the dustpan. He ended up needing 4 staples in his head. He then proceeded to throw my mother's TV on the ground to stomp on it. My mother came in the room to help the man bleeding and to tell him to get out or she was calling the police. He proceeded to throw her onto the couch and started trying to punch her. My mother and her friend got away to the kitchen to call the police. The perpetrator then destroyed the dining room, ripped the thermostat off the wall, threw my mother's coffee maker at her and stomp on the open dishwasher door destroying it. While she was trying to get to her bedroom he pushed her down a flight of 3 stairs. He then left. Police showed up after he left. They found him on his bike down the road but did not arrest him, just took him back to the group home.

 My mother is bruised, sprained in 3 places, possibly concussed and scared with him being so close and having a key to her home. I'm unsure why he was taken back to the group home and not arrested. I'm also unsure how to proceed. Are we able to get an emergency order of protection without him being taken into custody at all? Are we able to sue him for damages or the group home? We were also told (but cannot confirm) that he is supposed to be on medication but the home has not been giving it to him. ",3,1736418295.0,legaladvice,10,1.0,False
