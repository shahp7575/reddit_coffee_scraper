1h70hp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h70hp0/am_i_catching_feelings_for_my_girl_bsf_again/,Am I catching feelings for my girl bsf again?,"Sorry for what will be a long post but want to explain our relationship. We're both 22, graduated uni in May. I'm working now back home and she's doing an extra year of school, so we're not near each other atm but when she visits home we meet up since she doesn't live too far.

Anyway, I met up with her over the weekend and it was our first time seeing each other in probably 5 months or so. And right away I remembered why I love being friends with her and realized how much I missed hanging out with her. Since school ended, we text a little and then ft'd a few times but not super often just bc we've both been busy. So we had a lot to catch up on and I just really had a great time with her and I know she did too (she was already talking about meeting up again over winter break). She's the closest I've ever been with a girl and I just feel so comfortable around her and feel like I can talk to her for hours about anything. But now I'm a bit conflicted on if I really do just love her as my girl bsf or if I might be having feelings for her again?

For context on my past feelings:

we were in the same friend group in college but didn't become close until we started having more classes together sophomore year. We were in 3 classes together and through that just became really close, we would go to and from class together, study/work together, and just talk and text a bunch. We started to hang out a lot just us two as well, whether it was watching tv or getting coffee, etc. She had told me how she's never felt so comfortable around a guy before and we really did just love hanging out together. So much so that she even suggested meeting up over the summer (which was unlike her bc she basically always waits for other people to ask her to hang out).

So, we met up over the summer just once unfortunately, but it was a great time, and then picked right back up when the fall junior semester started. She gave me a huge hug when I saw her for the first time and that right there confirmed my feelings for her. We continued to hang out and she was subtly flirty and awkward in a way that felt like we were becoming more than friends. She'd be a bit touchy, would say silly but cute lines like ""I waited in line with you for 5 minutes so now you owe me 5 minutes to do whatever I want,"" etc. And one event in particular not to give tmi, but she got too drunk at a party we went too, we were off dancing and hanging on our own (as we usually were) so I took care of her until her friends came but even when they got there, she still wanted me to take care of her and so In my mind, I thought this meant she for sure liked me as more than a friend. And everyone else thought we were more than friends, so much that probably 10+ people that semester asked me if we were dating. I never did ask her out because I valued our friendship so much I didn't want to risk making things weird, but eventually I did ask her if she ever saw us as more than friends, to which she said not really and she couldn't focus on a relationship, so basically shut down that idea. This made things a bit weird between us for a little while but we eventually got over it.

For a good while I'd say we weren't as close but were still pretty good friends. I eventually lost feelings for her and really just missed how close we were as friends, so when we did start to talk a lot again and see each other more I felt so much better. I actually think since school ended we've become even closer again maybe since we just dont see each other as much and at least for me, it makes me realize how much I miss being close with her and hanging out. So, anyways, we've gotten close again and I consider her one of my best friends. But also Im wondering if I like her as more than that again. Like I definitely am not crushing on her like I did two years ago. I think maybe I just want a gf and right now she's the closest I have to it, so that is what's confusing my feelings for her? Idk. And am I dumb to think I would ever have a chance with her down the line? I love that she's my girl bsf but if she were to ever say she liked me as more than that, I probably would take the chance bc she's such a cool/cute girl.

1h70fkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1h70fkb/dallas_tx_dashers/,Dallas tx dashers???,"I'm posting this probably just for some validation and also to see if anyone else in dallas struggles with this üò≠
‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è 
warning for 
how long this may be because i am a yapper ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

So I use doordash often, and without a doubt every time I get a dasher who doesn't speak English which is fine generally but it seems like they all ONLY speak spanish?? This isn't typically something id care about normally but I live in an apartment complex, whoever designed this place did a god awful job, the complex is split in half basically, there are two entrance gates, one is huge and has the official apartment name signs by it and is well lit, but the second is a little further up the road, smaller and dark. 
For some reason, they made the two sides of the complex not be connected by any road at all, so if you enter the main gate it seems like you should enter, you cant get to my building unless you walk through all the buildings in the middle. My building is only accessible by car if you enter the second smaller gate which puts you on one road that goes straight down to my building.
This is not particularly about how to word this for dashers or about instructions as I have the gate you need to enter to get to me pinned and in the instructions the first thing it says is the pin is just at the Gate and not near my building.
When i did the pin at my building instead it would bring their gps to the exit gate on the other side of the complex you cannot enter only exit, if i put the pin somewhere in the middle they enter the wrong gate. 

I simplified the directions quite a bit, just stating ""pin is at the gate that leads you to my building. My door is not near the pin. Enter the pinned gate ONLY or you will be stuck on the wrong side"" and then just simply say the road goes straight to my building and theyll see it easily. I also MESSAGE THEM these instructions incase they dont read the app instructions and i even translate it to Spanish for them. Without a doubt every single time its ignored even when they reply ""got it"" i know damn well now that means they dont got it lmao. 
The gate is a long way for me to walk to try and meet them there instead + Im paying them to bring it to my door anyway. 

They ALWAYS enter the wrong gate and get stuck, most even ignore my messages trying to tell them this is absolutely not the complex to try and wing it in because youre just gonna waste your time for no reason so just read the instructions PLEASE!! 
Yesterday my dasher entered the wrong gate, searched every apartment building on the wrong side, kept telling me hes ""here"" and ""dont worry im in"" I was like huh??? üò≠ and he went to the pinned gate eventually, but refused to accept the pin wasnt near my door. He eventually made it to my building but then didnt leave the food, he just left with it and went back the opposite direction sitting at the pinned gate. I was like why are you going the opposite direction you were just here why did you leave?? And he said """"""he told me it is fda violation to leave the food unattended and no answer"""""" i was like WHAT???? Its a leave at door order and you didn't even knock so who is this ""he"" its a no contact order.. 
this was literally a 55 minute ordeal and he suggested i walk half a mile to him instead and i said no i wasn't able to do that plus i am paying him to leave it at my door his job fr has one criteria?!? So he got mad said he was reporting my profanity and cancelled the order keeping my food üíÄ

And now today the dasher entered the wrong gate, wouldnt let go of trying to search the pinned area for my apartment as i am begging him to please read the instructions it tells him everything he needs to know. I sent them 5 times and translated to Spanish twice. Hed just say ""cant get into apartment"" and ""at 11"" and i was like i do not live in that area of the complex ive told u several timesss pleasee üò≠ and hed send a picture of his car for some reason and just kept saying stuff like ""you not in 1010"" id just be like SIR PLEASEE ITS BEEN 25 MINUTES OF U SITTING IN THE COMPLEX JUST READ THE INSTRUCTIONSSSSS and he finallllyyyy about half hour later delivered it, only to discover the whole coffee i ordered spilled in the bag leaking all over my porch and then in my living room and onto the food I was like nooo way üòÄüòÄüòÄ and revoked the tip bc wtf üò≠üò≠

I can't understand why they would rather run around the apartment complex completely confused and wasting their time and my time when they could just read three sentences of the instructions and be done with it and literally like three minutes like it's generally very very easy if you just enter the correct gate because there's only one road once you enter the correct gate and it goes straight to my building like it would generally take like 2-3 minutes to Deliver it but they just always just choose not to and they just run around the apartment for like 30 minutes to an hour just ignoring me in the messages and the instructions and I'm like what is going on it is quite literally like every single time that I order which is often and I have never gotten a dasher that Speaks English for some reason not once even if the tip is very high nothing changes with the delivery so I don't understand what's going on does anybody else in Dallas have this problem or is this just a curse that I must bear because of this apartment complex üò≠üò≠üíÄ",1,1733371617.0,doordash,2,1.0,False
1h70esb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1h70esb/why_do_i_give_so_much_effort_too_soon/,Why do I give so much effort too soon?,"When I (30M) meet a girl and we hit it off, I ruin it with how much i try. We have a few dates and I feel like I go all in. No, wedding bells are not ringing, but I think about them during the day, ill reply to their texts when i get them, and want to talk to them or see them again. Typically I restrain myself from doing this as it is not often reciprocated, and the effort is generally a deal breaker. I'm aware that the perception of replying fast is ""he must be desperate/he must not have a life"" but I'm genuinely free enough at work between jobs to send a text. But I know it scares women away so I don't. But that's not genuine to who I am as a person, and it creates this internal conflict where I WANT to care and show effort but know it'll ruin things. When I suppress those desires, and text short, and don't make myself available the relationship lasts waaaaay longer. But if I feel comfortable to be myself there's a strong connection with a short fuse that goes out with a BANG.

Example: me and a girl met for coffee, hit it off, saw each other frequently after. Well 2 weeks into knowing each other she was sick. I told myself just leave her be, don't text, don't bother her, just let her rest...... next thing I know I'm on my way to the market and bought stuff to make her breakfast and a smoothie, and medicine, and flowers. Food and nutrients for her physical health, flowers for her mental health. Because being sick sucks. The entire time I'm cooking at home I'm telling myself ""you're doing way too much just stop you're going to ruin this"" and next thing I know I'm at her door and drop it off to her. This is not the best example because this girl actually did greatly appreciate it and reciprocated it by leaving me dinner and loves notes around my house when she knew I'd fly back home really late (the only time I can think where someone reciprocated that energy). I share because it's a recent one that highlights that internal conflict and anxiety


More often then not I can meet a girl, hit it off, and then I start doing all these elaborate things and woo them and make them smile and feel good. And they hate it. And it makes me feel wrong as a person. Do I not understand social cues or what?


And now I have a date with someone in just over a week... and I find myself getting extremely nervous and anxious and thinking about them. I find them very attractive and their personality is very bubbly and a joy to be around. Her smile is infectious. It's been a while since we first met, never dated. I feel like my nerves are going to mess this up. I feel like I don't really know her that well, some initial conversation from months ago, but I don't know her well enough to be thinking about her 24/7 like this.


I know part of it is I haven't dated anyone in years. Just been focusing on myself and going to the gym. But the amount I think about this girl has been drowning me. The worse part is I am about 90% sure she is not losing sleep or stressing or thinking about me the same way. And why would she? I'm a familiar face who asked her out and she said yes but overall a stranger. I mean maybe theres a 10% chance she was absolutely smitten by me too and has been eagerly awaiting this day but I feel she would've made an effort to stay in touch (I tried initially but backed off).


 So then i think, maybe I shouldn't pursue someone who doesn't care or think the same as I do? I would reach out and check on them, but they wouldn't to me. I should just be my unapologetic self and see who stays and who leaves, yet I know the outcome of that and it's being misunderstood and alone for life. Oof. Sometimes I think I just shouldn't date at all


TL;DR anxiety, obsessing, and over committing early on into dating people who are slower to give me an equal place in their life.",3,1733371551.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

30 days later and feel great. No cravings accept just feeling like something is missing in the morning. Depression and boredom were tough to manage at times. When I was fishing I missed the ritual of nicotine.

I found treating myself to sweets or an extra coffee helped. Cutting back on alcohol especially in the early days was key to caving. The occasional Weed gummy in the evening helped take the edge off.

During 2020, he linked up with Dan Auerbach and cut his solo debut El Dorado, garnering a GRAMMY¬Æ Award nomination for ‚ÄúBest Americana Album.‚Äù Between headlining venues, he performed alongside Chris Stapleton, Greta Van Fleet, and Nathanial Rateliff in addition to gracing the bills of Stagecoach and more. He has launched various mental health initiatives, including a guitar auction collaboration with MusiCares. His 2024 album Mood Swingsfeels like the moment of baptism when water washes away a life‚Äôs worth of sins and degradation and all that‚Äôs left is a revived, yet still real-as-hell primal scream. Emphasizing his vocals front-and-center more than ever before, the trusty guitar he‚Äôs so often associated with plays the sideman this time around (though there‚Äôs no shortage of impressive shredding).

I noticed A rash on my chest was a red spot so I went to the walk-in clinic. They suggested what they thought it was and they gave me some antibiotics for it. They said that I had some type of cellulitis from what they could tell. Somehow I must have irritated a certain area Maybe I got a scratch or a cut and it got in. So I took the antibiotics for 8 days like I was supposed to. After like 4 days I noticed I had some kind of yellowing on my tongue and a couple of white bumps now they seem hard.

Now I tend to drink two cups of coffee a day and I smoke cannabis very rarely I do not really smoke anymore. 

Wondering if this is some type of hygiene issue. I have used mouthwash a few times rince my mouth out with warm salt water A couple times I even took a toothbrush with some toothpaste and I scrubbed on the tongue the last couple of days at least once a day. 

Do not really know if that is doing anything. Not really sure what this is I plan to go to my primary care provider and see a nurse on Thursday. They didn't imply that I needed to go to the hospital or that it was anything serious. Really not sure. Hopefully whatever this is can be treated and cured.

Maybe there is something That I can do to help improve the condition but I am not sure.

I've taken my last dose of antibiotics on Sunday here it is Wednesday almost Thursday.

1h704l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1h704l1/my_bisalp_experience_day_of/,"My bisalp experience, day of!","Going to go through the whole thing to give y'all the best possible picture. I'm located in Columbia, Missouri (aka one of the blue parts) and got my bisalp done by Dr. Karen Thies. 

My instructions were not to eat anything after 11 PM yesterday, clear liquids fine until 7 AM (procedure scheduled for 11 AM today). I stopped eating at around 9-10 last night and the only thing I consumed after that was a big gulp of water with my morning medications which I was also given the OK to take before 7. I was specifically told to *not* take my metformin, but my other meds were all cleared. I also took a first dose of Miralax yesterday and plan on taking it for a week because I'm prone to constipation anyway and I wanted to be prepared.

Morning started off on a rough note solely by my own mistake - my partner had to drop me off extra early and I realized after she had drove off that I left my bag with my phone and all entertainment in it in her car :\^) I had to get help from someone at the little coffee shop they have in the lobby to let her know so she'd know I couldn't call her and tell her where she was, and then I bought a Sudoku book from the gift shop to kill time lol. 

Scheduling stuff beccause it was a bit of a pain: I was scheduled for check-in at 9 and surgery at 11. My partner had an 8 AM dental appointment scheduled which was not a concern since she would be there well before I had the surgery itself, but she ended up needing an emergency extraction which a different dentist needed to do, and could only get that scheduled for 1 PM. This made things annoying but it worked out fine.

I checked in first at 8:30 in the general office, around 8:45 in the surgery area, and then at about 9 I got properly brought into my room. I was given a gown, a hairnet, hospital socks, and a set of... basically wet wipes? to wipe myself down with. I was given a bag to put all my personal belongings in but I was allowed to keep my Sudoku book out to entertain myself with (if I had had my phone I would have been allowed to use that). 

Things get a little fuzzy at this point because a lot of nurses and other medical professionals came in over the next two hours and I don't really remember exactly who did what lol. I did have to give a urine sample which was not ideal when I wasn't allowed to drink any water but I managed. I was mostly asked what procedure I was getting, if I had X conditions (heart problems, kidney or liver problems, breathing problems, diabetes), what medications I was taking, things like that. Had to sign some consent forms as well. 

Around 9:30 a nurse put in my IV port, which was unpleasant because the first vein she tried was uncooperative and I'm probably going to have a nasty bruise on my right hand. She was very nice though and checked in with me repeatedly to make sure I was doing okay. She ended up putting the port in in my left arm and it was fine there though a bit uncomfortable to move around.

After I was set up there she was able to get my partner who had arrived from the waiting room and she was able to stay with me until the procedure at 11. Before then the anesthesiologist came in to discuss anesthesia and to sign another form for that, a medical student came in to ask permission to observe the procedure, and a couple of other nurses came in to introduce themselves. 

Random note: I remember being told that the doctor herself would come in to talk to me, but I don't remember her doing so. She's my regular doctor so I feel like I wouldn't have missed her but maybe she came in when they'd already started pushing pain meds? Unclear.

Anyway, they wheeled me off shortly after 11 and the anesthesiologist pushed some pain meds he described as being ""like a couple of cocktails"". I didn't really feel much difference but I don't feel much from a couple of cocktails until I stand up anyway, so. Once we got to the room they put me under pretty quickly, I'm used to overhearing some doctor discussion before a surgery and then being put under but they just got right to it. The anesthesiologist gave me something beforehand that he warned me would make my vision blurry and my hearing ring and boy he wasn't wrong. I remember being like ""whooooooa what's going on..."" and him saying don't worry, that's normal, I'm giving you the anesthesia now okay? And me going ""okaaaaaaaaay..."" and then being out.

I believe I woke up at about 1:15 PM going by my first memory of seeing the nurse's watch when she noticed I was awake, thought it could have been a little earlier. I was pretty uncomfortable when I woke up; I cried quite a bit and was shaking a lot, but I always have a bit of a panic reaction to initially waking up so this wasn't unexpected. I was in some pain from my incision sites and had a mild sore throat. What I wasn't really expecting was the most noticeable discomfort was actually from my catheter site - my urethra was super uncomfortable and felt sort of just in pain and sort of like I had to pee. I was given some painkillers both through my IV and orally, and after I had calmed down a bit and woken up a little more I got taken back to a recovery room and given graham crackers and apple juice.

Forgot to mention, the anesthesiologist offered and I accepted an anti-nausea patch before I went under because I told him I get carsick easily. Apparently I can leave it on for three days. Whether or not it's a result of that I don't know, but I haven't felt any nausea since waking up and I was hungry within half an hour. 

I was allowed to leave less than an hour after I woke up, around 2 PM, but because of the aforementioned emergency dentist appointment my partner had I had to stay she could get me. She also had all of my personal belongings so I once again had nothing to do, but my primary interest was in dozing anyway so it wasn't much of an issue. There was a TV in the room which I did watch a little. There was no requirement for me to be able to pee before I could leave, which I've had for previous surgeries, but I did end up needing to pee like immediately after drinking the apple juice and was able to with no issues. 

Walking was a bit wobbly but not too difficult. Sitting down on the toilet was a little rough but not too bad either mostly since hospital toilets are so high up. Peeing was a bit painful. I will note that my nurse mentioned that I had 4 incisions insstead of the planned 3 but did not mention why; she said the 4th (through my belly button) is smaller than the others and should heal the fastest.

Eventually my partner arrived and I ended up leaving at about 3:30 PM. I was prescribed 4 medications - prescription strength ibuprofen and acetaminophen as primary painkillers, oxycodone for breakthrough pain, and combination sennosides-docusate for constipation. I asked about the Miralax I was taking and was told it was perfectly safe to take both constipation meds together as they're both primarily gentle stool softeners. I was wheeled out of the OR by a nurse in a wheelchair and then my partner wheeled me to the pharmacy to buy the meds ($12 with insurance, almost entirely from the sennosides-docusate; the other three meds were less than $0.50 each) and then to the car.

We were in the car for longer than I would have preferred as we had some errands to run before going home, but honestly I was fine. Some pain with bumps and turns but nothing major. The most pressing thing at this point was still just the pain in my urethra from the catheter. The sore throat had already resolved by this point (guess I bought cough drops and a week's worth of popsicles for no reason- oh well). 

When I finally got home, I took an oxycodone, put on some comfy pajamas, and got cozy. I felt a little pain in my shoulder at one point and remembered sudddenly that gas pain was an issue and took some Gas-X before it got any worse. Otherwise pain has been very manageable! I've also been surprisingly wide awake; I expected to come home and immediately sleep but I've been playing video games instead. 

I was told not to do any bending or lifting anything heavier than a milk jug for at least 2 weeks, ideally longer; I've already broken the bending prohibition once (dropped my phone on the floor) and while I'll keep avoiding it to avoid popping any of my incision sites open, I will say it didn't hurt that much. I'm able to twist without any problems. Walking is uncomfortable but hardly a major problem. I'm not able to do some chores that I have to leave to my partner for a while (like letting the dog in and out and feeding the cats) but I feel capable of feeding myself, getting to the bathroom, etc. Honestly as someone who does WFH I feel like I probably *could* go straight to work tomorrow if I was forced to. I'm not doing that, but I probably could.

ONE WARNING because this is something I didn't see come up, so maybe I'm just unlucky, but I want to warn that it's a possibility for anyone else: my urethra still hurts and hurts a LOT. I tried to pee when there was only a little urine there and it felt like I was trying to piss lava. I happened to have some AZO handy from my last UTI and I'm not sure how much that will help but I took some a bit ago and I'm praying it gets me through this because, yikes. Also drinking a lot of water. 

My surgical report was uploaded to my portal not long after I got out. I read it and it was interesting; it did reveal why I have 4 incisions, which is because one of the incisions they were unable to get a trocar positioned properly through because I had too much visceral fat in that area. After a few failed attempts they went in through the belly button instead and had no problems that way; they confirmed that there was no injury or complications caused by this outside of having an extra incision to heal.

Anyway, as of 9:45 PM, I'm feeling pretty okay. Probably going to take some ibuprofen before bed. I'm still pretty awake but my partner has work so I've gotta turn down for her sake. I'll update tomorrow with how I'm feeling then, and I'm happy to answer any questions! Sorry for writing a novel here lol.",1,1733370672.0,sterilization,0,1.0,False

[ added TLDR at the bottom ] 

Posting from my throwaway even though it‚Äôs not really , uh, problematic? Anyway 





Im worried. (Perhaps overthinking it)

I started vyvanse 20mg back in , June? I started working at a restaurant that was high energy , fast paced and I was thrown to the wolves immediately. 

My doctor knew this and wanted me to be careful incase something happened at work. 

I actually did, very very well I was shocked myself. Situations that would typically have me crying hysterically, quit on the spot, all of it was just a regular day. Even my boss witnessed something and said ‚Äú you handled that really well I didn‚Äôt think you would. Most people would have lost their shlt ‚Äú 

That was June. Here we are. Up to 80mg. 

I have good days and bad days. I see my doctor often and I trust that he knows what he‚Äôs doing. 

He‚Äôs never particularly concerned about side effects - more so how long I‚Äôm sleeping , if I have trouble falling or staying asleep, when do I take the medication and how long do I find it lasts until. 

This year overall has been tough. Hardest , year ever in my life hands down. 

Lost my car (accident) malpractice in hospital for a regular , typical common issue a lot of people get (they gave me medication 3x the amount you‚Äôre supposed to take in a day. In 45 minutes. üëÄ) I was near cardiac arrest. Divorce papers hit me March 1. And it‚Äôs been nothing but problems since. üëç 

Anyway. I‚Äôve done my fair share of therapy. 
Feelings are not facts. Analyzing my feelings. 
If I‚Äôm emotional. Why? Am I tired? Have I eaten? 

Generally speaking - as mentioned - if I‚Äôm upset / crying / mad, it‚Äôs very likely there is a valid reason to it (debt collectors calling , family qualms etc) 

My entire trial of vyvanse as I said it‚Äôs up and down. Good and bad days. There‚Äôs other factors than what he‚Äôs asking (atleast, I feel they would play apart??)

If I eat a decent breakfast, I feel I have a better, productive day. 

If I do not eat in the morning and wash my medicine down with coffee, ( I know that‚Äôs frowned upon. But I like coffee) 
Im fumbling. Scatterbrained. Looking for something already in my hand. Agitated. Annoyed. 

The first few months went well though?? 
Work was great. I was busy (which we know routine typically helps) things were becoming organized around my house. 

I recently got a storage unit and everything there and here now looks like I‚Äôm living in the back room of a thrift store. It‚Äôs, a lot 


Anyway. Nothing related to meds - 

But , I‚Äôve read and seen people mention they felt this way too (maybe I don‚Äôt have adhd? I very likely do though because it was my doctor who observed me acting ‚Äú quirky ‚Äú asked TWICE. Two separate visits. 

I said I was never tested as a child because of parental neglect. I said I struggled a lot in school. As a child into my teens. I got in trouble here and there. Always daydreaming. I remember being hit by my teacher for tapping my foot on the table during music lessons, (her singing was awful) 

Idk what else to say. Just. Chime in please üòî


TLDR:

Imposter syndrome (I think they call it that? ) I think perhaps I don‚Äôt have adhd even though I check all the boxes , I‚Äôve had issues in school all my life , (wasn‚Äôt documented as a child though because of neglect in the family , never saw doctors )

I was scolded by my now former Endocrinologist recently for not being able to drink 40 total ounces a day. I can do 50, I can do 46, but 40 is tough for me. All my liquids include 37-42 oz of water plus 6 oz of coffee with 2 oz of almond mild creamer. I think if I'm playing tennis or pickleball then it seems reasonable I may need a little more fluid that day. But she was strict on 40 oz no matter activity level so, it hasn't been doable for me is the answer. Or I play tennis feeling dizzy, thirsty and panting with my tongue out in the summer, that's also happened when she wanted me lower for daily liquid intake... in the 30's.

Saw a new Endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic who gave some interesting insight. I made a comment that the water tracking apps all have a starting goal of 60 oz and constantly chime at me to drink more when I'm already above my pre-set goal of 40 oz. She said there's a whole podcast on the issue that companies who sell electrolyte drinks have pushed for people to drink more and more bc it's profitable for them. I can definitely believe that. That the idea we need to drink so much water (say, above 40 oz) is not backed in science. She said 40 oz should be doable, but then of course after the fact had to look up the conversion of my personal average 50 oz to liters. Humble brag, my American self was able to spit out ""about 1.5 liters"" just as she went to pull up google. ha with all my past endocrinologists and several friends growing up with the metric system, I've got it down pat now. Anyway, diabetes insipidus testing continues. Went through it in 2017 without it being ruled in or out.

The burials were surrounded by large stone slabs, some of which were elaborately painted with swirling geometric patterns on the inside. At the entrance of the tombs stood fang-toothed guardians, as if to protect the deceased within the afterlife. Inside were placed stone or wood sarcophaguses, with human and animal depictions carved into their lids. The mounds seem to have been located directly within the main grounds of each village, implying that the deceased remained a central part of life. What we know of such chiefdoms suggests that their ancestors were worshipped in a cult of the dead.

I am too old for this,"During Thanksgiving my mom and I butt head few times. We always have issues because our hosting style is very different.  We serve tea after meal, we are Asian. I don't drink tea or coffee so often forget to plan for it but I have enough tea drinking family members to help make it. 

The entire time my mom is constantly commenting/dictating: Give this person the nicer cup, Give your aunt tea eventhought she said she didn't want some.  Oh you gave this person milk tea but they drink black tea.  I had 30+ ppl over and I don't even drink tea. So I was getting frustrated.  

One of my cousin got married this year and this was the first time his wife, let's call her N, came to my place.  she came in the kitchen and we asked about tea and she declined.  Min later, after we were done with tea madness, mom enters the kitchen and sees N & says ""you forgot to give N tea"".  I know she didn't mean anything by it and she isnt good with words.  But I became sensitive to her use of word ""you forgot"" sounded like accusing/failing vs had she asked question ""did u give N tea"".  

So I said  ""could you just ask her first"". I guess I was little too loud as everyone in the kitchen stopped n stared at us. So I laughed and repeated the sentence and N said ""no thanks"".  But mom's face was red with frustration.  She said few mean things to me but did not want to create scene.  

Since that day she hasn't called me. She normally calls 2x a day. When I call her she doesn't pick up. I know she is still mad. Part of me feels guilty but seriously it's over tea. Part of me knows we always had power struggle, especially when it comes to traditional home maker role. Because I was never interested in cooking or hosting parties, until 2 years ago. She felt like I need guidance & am lost without her. 

I felt extra bad because on the weekend I visited a friend who lost her mom to cancer recently. As we are talking about mothers, I realize mine is mad at me over tea. I am not sure if I should give her some space or go over n apologize. I am too old for this & yet its bothering me

Should I have tried to find the perfect balance by keep playing with fine/coarse grinding coffee instead or is programming the shot to manipulate the brew time actually a right way of doing things??

FYI I am using best before Lavazza beans with pressurised basket (I know I know I‚Äôm just getting started and I‚Äôm hoping this is also the reason why it took so long to get dialled in properly, it seems the best results are achieved with truly fresh beans instead).

Anyway, I have tried countless combinations from ground size to dose adjustment to temp increase/decrease and the only way for me to get enough brew time, good mg output and decent taste was to program the shot. Had to go through this process each time I had to test a newly brewed coffee. Has anyone done this before?

Seen a bunch of videos where people would just grind slightly fine or coarser to get the desired ratio. For some reason most of my coffee would stop brewing far too soon no matter what.

His (my bfs) mom: Loves gummies and random thrift finds, makes and sells shirt designs and the like.

Conservative guy that has a problem with how quiet I am, so I really need to find something good. His grandpa: loves trains (there's train themed stuff everywhere throughout his house), was a lawyer, likes phantom of the opera. Real nice guy, I like him a lot. His grandma: loves chocolate, has mocha coffee every morning. I like her a lot too. His aunt: loves dried banana, Hawailan goods, likes to sew and bake, has an adorable dog. It should be noted she's vegan and lactose intolerant. I love her a lot, she's probably my favorite of my bfs family. Then there's the aunts son in law I met who's really cool and also the father to my bfs 5 year old niece (who I have heard is adorable). Not sure what to get them two, or if I'm even obligated to.

I chose to be honest about my position and that I won‚Äôt be able to afford it, and I gave them over a week notice, but I did state that they should still go out and do something, I will participate in secret santa at the end of the month (this will give me some time to get some money together).

DOWNTOWN. That means that both occasions in total would cost me like $200-300, food, gift and transportation included! Cause they never want to drive, always Uber! 

I chose to be honest about my position and that I won‚Äôt be able to afford it, and I gave them over a week notice, but I did state that they should still go out and do something, I will participate in secret santa at the end of the month (this will give me some time to get some money together). 

I was expecting a thoughtful and loving response in return but the one I got was quite harsh. Out of 3 people in the group chat, 1 responded ‚Äúit was for your birthday but ok understandable, I would appreciate if you would be transparent from the start because when it comes to us it seems like you can‚Äôt do things anymore‚Äù and I asked her to clarify what she meant and I explained my side of things how I am barely affording putting gas into my car. She said she doesn‚Äôt want to explain , hope things work out for me and to let us know if you need support. That‚Äôs it. No other text. 

For deeper context, I‚Äôve been focusing primarily on school, I barely go out , and the last time I did go out with them, it cost me over $160 in food and Ubers. I always try to initiate more intimate things like grabbing a coffee or dessert. They don‚Äôt appreciate that. I think they‚Äôre salty because I recently went out on a double date , with my best friend but I didn‚Äôt spend a dime, my boyfriend paid for me..

I‚Äôve been asthmatic since childhood and despite frequent chest infections it was well managed up until I was hospitalised with a flu a couple years back. 

I was hospitalised twice last year with a flu and a chest infection, and have only gone downhill from there. 

I feel like my asthma has completely taken over my life, since March I have had two respiratory failures requiring intubation, 3 CCU admissions and multiple resus trips for life threatening attacks this year, caused by colds, chest infections and pneumonia. 

My specialists keep talking about starting biologicals but I can‚Äôt seem to stay out of critical care long enough to make my follow up appointments and every time I‚Äôm rehospitalised my medications are changed around and we are back to square one and re starting the follow up pathway. Every time I stop pred I end up attacking within days and I‚Äôm currently taking 8 of those a day, spiriva, salbutamol, montelukast and salmeterol to barely be functioning.  

After my last attack a few weeks ago I just haven‚Äôt recovered, I‚Äôm exhausted beyond belief constantly, becoming dizzy and losing my vision from talking for too long or doing any physically activity, needing my rescue inhailer multiple times a day most days and waking up from sleep constantly in cold sweats dizzy and confused with the pulse ox reading low 80‚Äôs. I‚Äôve been awake for days at this point because I‚Äôm terrified that I won‚Äôt wake up if I go to sleep and I finally have a follow up on the 10th to talk about the biologicals now I‚Äôve done spirometery, x rays, CTs etc so I don‚Äôt want to go back to the hospital and risk my appointment being messed up. 

I don‚Äôt even know what more they‚Äôre going to be able to do for me. A couple of years ago I was climbing mountains, competing in para sports (I‚Äôm physically disabled), travelling across Europe solo and running a company, now I‚Äôm absolutely floored from going out for coffee with a friend and with how much medication im using just to stop me going into arrest I‚Äôm scared that there will be nothing more they can do and I‚Äôll die from one of these attacks.

FYI I am using best before Lavazza beans with pressurised basket (I know I know I‚Äôm just getting started and I‚Äôm hoping this is also the reason why it took so long to get dialled in properly, it seems the best results are achieved with truly fresh beans instead).

Anyway, I have tried countless combinations from ground size to dose adjustment to temp increase/decrease and the only way for me to get enough brew time, good mg output and decent taste was to program the shot. Had to go through this process each time I had to test a newly brewed coffee. Has anyone done this before?

Seen a bunch of videos where people would just grind slightly fine or coarser to get the desired ratio. For some reason most of my coffee would stop brewing far too soon no matter what.

TLDR at bottom. 

The backstory. 

So this is going to out me as old, for sure, but here goes. Part of the reason I feel like I can tell this story is that the statute of limits for anything I did would be passed by now. 

When I was a teenager I spent quite a bit of time poking around on Yahoo's chatrooms and Yahoo clubs. I really liked Yahoo clubs. They were basically just chat boards for specific topics.

 I initially posted in a few clubs that were about writing and lyrics, they were basically rap battles but with lyrics only, since most people didn't have the skills or tech to make actual music. I spent months and months writing and at one point even was ""champion"" in a few clubs. 

At that point someone hit me up on Yahoo chat and being a niave kid, they managed to convince me it was a friend messing around and not telling you who they were. Again being incredibly naive I gave them the answers to my security questions, because they were simple things like what's your best friend's name, your pet's name, and at that point I never considered it to be information I shouldn't share. 

Well obviously they got into my account, and posted a bunch of posts about how I loved fellating people, lol. Looking back, it was pretty hilarious. It was a big learning moment for me though. I only had to go through something like that once to learn the importance of security. Verify don't trust.

I of course made a new account and managed to let everybody know, ""Hey, that was not me I was hacked, yada yada"", but I was still really agitated. 

Now if you weren't on the internet at that point, you may not understand how different the internet was. It was a time when you could go into a chat room and use code and create links and do all sorts of weird stuff that I can't imagine they would let you do nowadays, but maybe I'm wrong. 

Like there was a website I knew of, that if you went to it, it would open up pop-ups until your computer overloaded and crashed. I don't know that such a thing would even work now.  When I was a kid I used to know how to make the text on the link say whatever I wanted but go to whatever site I wanted. So on alternate accounts I would go into Yahoo chat rooms and put links that said like ""free porn"", but have the link go to that alternative website, and watch the user count in the chat drop significantly, for the lulz, as they say. 

Or another example of how different things are. I didn't have the internet. We could barely afford a computer, My dad was definitely not paying for the internet. So I used to use these free AOL and Alta Vista CDs. They would allow you to use dial up for a certain amount of hours before they would expire. But when you would go to connect them they would tell you whether you did or didn't have any hours left.

It dawned on me that I had to be connected to the internet for them to check how many hours I had left. So I would dial up to Alta Vista and stay on the screen that told me I didn't have the ability to use the internet, then tab to a new internet browser and use the internet. And I was able to use the internet like that for a year or two. There's no way that would work nowadays, for so many reasons. 

Okay, so now that you are more familiar with the internet back then, for those who aren't familiar, back to the story. So instilled with an anger towards people like those who took my account I came up with a way to potentially get back at them. 

I created a new email. YhPsswrdRcvry@yahoo.com. Yahoo password Recovery without vowels. Then I right clicked the ""forgot my password"" link, and copied the link address. It was some long assortment of text that meant nothing to me, but more importantly even less to the average computer user. Then I inserted a few ""fields"", like (A),{B}, and [C]. And I inserted those ""fields"" into the password recovery link. 

It looked something like:

https://login.yahoo.com/forgot?.lang=en-US&src=homepage(A)&activity{B}=ybar-signin[C]&pspid=1197228339&.done=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2F&done=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2F

Then I proceeded to make a few fake accounts which I used to post all over all sorts of Yahoo clubs. The post was titled ""how to hack someone else's Yahoo account""

In the post I explained that what you needed to do to hack someone was copy the above link address, and fill it out with (A) your account login, {B} the account you want to log into, and [C] your password. I posted that if you send that link to YhPsswrdRcvry@yahoo.com, it would you use your credentials but open the other account. 

Honestly the whole concept is so stupid but amazingly enough when I logged on to the email that I created the next day there were literally hundreds of people who had sent me their logins and passwords. 

Of course being a mischievous teenager I felt ridiculously smug about the whole thing. I instantly started going into accounts and changing passwords and just kind of snooping around at their activity on Yahoo for anything that might be interesting. To be honest most of them were completely boring and all I did was just change their password and change as much information as I could or delete stuff. Minor things relatively speaking. 

But there was one email that I'll never forget. When I logged into the email and started snooping around the Yahoo account, they were subbed to, and I don't want to exaggerate, but I believe it was like somewhere between 150-300 different Yahoo clubs, All of which were dedicated to sharing passwords for porn sites. This was before free porn so that was a thing, so that's the type of barbarism people had to resort to. 

I remember looking at the list and being completely flabbergasted. Literally every fetish I could ever have thought of and all the basic stuff too. No judgement nowadays, you do you, but as a teenager I was like ""Wow, this person is a major weirdo and clearly has a problem"". 

So as I continued to poke around on this person's Yahoo mail , I realized their contact list on their Yahoo Mail was crazy full, like I remember this person had like 500 - 800 contacts or so. I remember being really impressed and thinking that whoever owned the email must have had a really important job or something to have that many people in their contact list. I honestly can't remember any of the emails although I remember I did read some of his emails, I mean, I read some of everybody's emails I was snooping. 

Anyway I remember being like well I think this guy has a problem, so I took a copy of the name of every Yahoo club that he was in. They were all obviously named, like ""Anal lover password swap"", and things like that. I put them an email titled something like ""Trying to battle my porn addiction."" And I wrote up this big letter as if I was the person whose email it was, saying I have a porn addiction and I'm struggling and I need help and so to hold myself accountable I'm sending a list of all the porn that I'm into to everyone, that way they can hold me accountable. And I emailed it to his entire list of contacts. 

I really wonder what happened to that person. I wish I could say I remember checking their email again to see what type of replies they got, but I honestly think I just moved on to other emails since I had so many to go through. 

If hell exists, I'm sure this is why I'll be there. At the time, to me, it was probably the funniest thing I had ever done. Right up there with putting salt in my grandpa's sugar container for his coffee. I would never do anything like that again and I'm not proud to have been such an immense shithead, but I'm not going to lie and say that I feel guilty over it anymore, it was when I was young, stupid and angry. Now I'm old, stupid and happy, lol. If you are the person I did that too, my bad, sincerely, sorry, hope all is well. 




TLDR: managed to scam people into sending me there password and login for Yahoo. Found somebody's Yahoo linked to hundreds of porn sites and emailed it to their contact list of hundreds of people with an email saying they were addicted to porn and that they needed to be held accountable by their friends and loved ones.

I am AFAB and am questioning my gender and gender expression. I would absolutely hate it if someone called me a girly-girl or something like that. My friends and family describe me as a tomboy and I personally take that as a compliment in a way. I use the pronouns she/her and are comfortable with them, but no one has ever actually called me anything other than that. I have an online friend and they agreed to try out he/him with me to see if I'm even comfortable with that. 

I have long hair that I don't want to cut (all I do is brush it, I typically don't style it), I don't wear makeup, and I only wear dresses if forced for a formal event or if it's a dance (although I typically skip dances). I wear all neutral clothes (some more masculine like baggy sweatpants and sports shirts, some more¬†feminine¬†like leggings or light colors) and most are dark/medium colors like green and black, nothing form-fitting and all, except the sweatpants, are athletic and nothing is revealing at all. I have a mix of masc and fem thoughts and opinions but probably leaning a bit more towards masc. Sometimes if I wear leggings, I feel too¬†feminine¬†in a way but that's not all the time, sometimes I like them. I only wear one piece swimsuits and I still don't take off my shirt in front of anyone to change in the locker room (I'm in high school and everyone else walks around in their bras and underwear) and I want to try girl boxers (boxers but female cut). I wear shorts because it's hot where I live, but they're all mid-thigh length so not revealing, but never skirts because they make be feel exposed and uncomfortable. I do not paint my nails either, I don't have the stereotypical love for Starbucks (or any coffee or tea) or Taylor Swift (I know that is very biased and categorical), and I personally believe that breasts, whether mine or other people's look weird, but I also don't want to hide them with a binder or something, I just don't want to see them (clothed or unclothed). I‚Äôm not necessarily/always uncomfortable (sometimes yes, mainly indifferent) with them unless they‚Äôre bigger than average (when covered they‚Äôre not too bad, but I‚Äôm uncomfortable with all unclothed). This could definitely correlate with me not finding the human body very appealing and I think it looks kind of weird. Ex. all genitalia, female breasts, hands and feet (depends on context) (any gender when unclothed).

I have more neutral hobbies like primitive camping and soccer. I feel almost proud or happy if someone comments how I'm like a boy (has only been said a couple times referring to my thoughts or actions). I feel like I would prefer to be associated with the attribute men tend to be portrayed with more than women in most aspects (ranging from emotionality to breadwinner etc (stereotypes)). I don't know what I am, I do know that I am not trans though. Maybe I'm cis but leaning more masculine? Maybe nonbinary? I'm open to all thoughts and opinions and will readily provide more details if asked (I can't think of any more right now). I know that labels aren't technically necessary, but I also know that understanding my orientation helped me a ton with becoming more comfortable with myself (aromantic, asexual, asensual, and low levels of most other things of that sort).",2,1733366575.0,questioning,3,1.0,False

I've noticed that since before my girlfriend (19F) and I (23M) of 8 months, she smells down there. I notice this because it's the same smells as when she uses the restroom: a very strong ammonia smell. It's strong if she takes off her pants or is in just underwear. When she pees. When I'm down there with my face.

I've considered from a previous article about general smell down there on r/relationship_advice

The top comment:

>Gonna ask a lot of questions here and educate you‚Ä¶it‚Äôs relevant.

>If you‚Äôre going to engage in sec as an adult you need to be an adult about this.

>1, are her underwear tight enough to leave pressure marks on her skin when she takes them off? If so she needs to go up a size. Not having enough air down there can make a difference.

>2, does she  use scented body wash or truly even put soap on the [down there]? The [down there] is a self cleaning organ it does not need soap on or in it. SummersEve and that other ‚Äúph balanced‚Äù soap is [BS].

>3, she may need to switch from tampons to a menstrual cup, tampons can leave fibers and mess up her natural ph.

>4 Does she wear underwear that does not have a cotton crotch? That will cause an ph issue as well.

>5 Do you wash your hands and clean your nails before you engage in touching her [hooha] This might be a you problem.

>6. Mens semen can cause Ph imbalances. That‚Äôs a you problem.

>7. Changes in her cycle can cause ph issues. 

>8. Certain lubricants especially notorious are the flavor and scented ones that can cause an issue.

>9. Condoms with spermicide can cause an issue.

>10. If changing all of that doesn‚Äôt work, she needs to go to the doctor.

>****DOOO NOOOOOT TELL HER SHE SMELLS OR THAT SHE STINKS***

>You pose it as a question. ‚ÄúBabe, I‚Äôve noticed your scent has changed, have you been doing anything different during your shower? A new soap? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs benefiting you. Maybe you should go to the gynecologist.‚Äù

I also think she's dehydrated, and needs to change her underwear more frequently. Maybe shave more frequently if that's a possible factor. I don't know if that's the right answer.

Regardless, she IS dehydrated. She doesn't drink enough water. I've suggested that to her before (for other reasons) and she hardly drinks a 30 oz Stanley a day but will drink other dehydrating drinks (Celsius, coffee) and eat heavily salted foods.

She also doesn't change her underwear frequently enough. Maybe once every two to three days sometimes. Lowkey unsanitary. Regardless, I think that could contribute too. She wears tighter fitting thongs.

She gets chemo by pill and steroids. Also special food for sensitive stomachs and nausea medicine if the chemo makes her sick. She is happy, playing, eating fine (she has an endless black hole forba stomach), and still her usual self. The vet has stated she isn't in pain. I don't even have to pill her - she takes them in a little pill pocket. 

The type of cancer she has can remain stable for awhile and then rapidly go downhill. But I'm ready for that and will let her go when the time comes. 

I also have a plan of care for her; we go to the vet monthly to get bloods checked and a general exam. She's weighed every week to make sure she maintains. 

----

My friend has been ""nudging"" me to put my cat down since her diagnosis. Him and another friend I haven't seen in awhile met up at a coffee shop. The other friend asked about how my cat was doing and I showed her some pictures.  That's when the talking about abuse started, but this time worse. 

I just couldn't take it anymore and snapped at him. Said he didn't know what he's talking about and needs to butt out. 

According to the friend this is some of why I'm abusing her. Won't list all of it but these are the main things:  

- She doesn't know what's going on and why she might feel nausea sometimes 

- I'm probably going to wake up and she will be suffering horribly one day 

- Cats hide pain so she might be in alot of pain already

- it's not fair to make her stick around 

- Giving her pills every day and taking her to the vet is torture

**MH TW:** >!&#x200B;!<I have suffered from depression most of my adult life. I would eat when depressed. Shop when depressed. (no drugs or alcohol though) And had a major issue with negative self-talk. After years with a great therapist and exiting my marriage, I don‚Äôt know if I can call it ‚Äúremission‚Äù, but I feel clear headed and ‚Äúable‚Äù almost all days. My financial situation has gotten me down lately, but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to let it derail me. I felt writing this MD would help me get it all out and remind myself that it can be done.>!&#x200B;!<

**Section One: Assets and Debt Use this section to explain your current financial picture at large.**

**Retirement Balance:** $77,000. I know I‚Äôm behind on retirement savings. I grew up in a blue collar family and just didn‚Äôt learn any of this until well into adulthood). Also, I raised my children as a single mom without support the vast majority of the time, so there was never room. I was 37-38 before I began retirement contributions.¬† I currently work in higher ed and receive a 10% contribution from my employer in addition to my mandatory 5% contribution.

**Equity:** Approximately $30,000. I purchased my house using an FHA loan with 3.5% down payment and the majority of my closing costs paid for by the seller. I‚Äôd saved about $15,000 but buying the house wiped out most of my savings.

**Savings account balance:** $1,200

**Checking account balance:** $1,550¬†

**Credit card debt:** $10,500 Mostly accumulated after getting divorced and buying my house. Also, helping out family members when I really can‚Äôt afford to. (more on that, later)

**Student loan debt:** $0 I received forgiveness under the IDR forgiveness plan. I graduated at 32 with a STEM degree and returned to my established career. I am going to go for a Master‚Äôs since my employer offers such an amazing tuition discount. It‚Äôll be a part-time program so hopefully, I can pay my share of tuition and fees out of pocket.

**Section Two: Income**

**Income Progression:** I've been working in my field for many years. I was laid off right before the recession and could not find work, so I decided to return to school to finish my undergraduate degree. My first job after graduation paid $50,000.¬†I was laid off from that job in 2015 and was making $54,000. Within a few months, I started a new job in the same field making $58,000.

I left that job in 2020 making $69,000 for a new job that paid $85,000 but turned out to be a disaster. I only lasted a few months and quit in early 2021. I did not have another job lined up but I was suffering mentally (I was still married at the time and this was a decision we made together).¬†

I started with my current employer in 2021 making $85,000.¬†

2022: $97,000

2023: $104,000

2024: $124,000

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** $7,663 (paid biweekly so this is the per-pay-period amount x 26 / 12)

**Taxes: $1804 total**

Federal: $595 (I filed an extension this year and still didn‚Äôt get my taxes done on time. I decided to hire a tax preparer and she said I‚Äôm underwithholding but we‚Äôll figure out what it should be once she gets everything prepared)

State: $440¬†

FICA: $769

**Pre-Tax Deductions: $806.70 total**

Health: $70

Dental: $4.70

Retirement: $565

Health FSA: $54 (my annual deductible is $100, copays $20 and my prescriptions are $10 copays. I am guaranteed to have one ER visit a year (it's like clockwork) and that‚Äôs a $100 deductible)

Parking $113

**After-tax Deductions:**

Additional Life: $13

Child Life: $0.91

**Section Three: Expenses**

For periodic expenses that occur other than monthly, I move money to a separate account and then just pay the thing when it comes up.

**Savings:** $433 (I have to balance debt reduction with replenishing savings. Being a homeowner can be expensive. I'm modifying the Dave Ramsey method and will save $2,000 and then focus that money on debt reduction)

**Mortgage:** $2,286 (includes homeowner's insurance and property taxes)

**Electric:** $75 (average)

**Heat:** $75 (average)

*Electric is really high for 3-4 months and really low most of the rest of the year.*

*Gas is REALLY high for 3-4 months over winter, middle of the road for 2 months, and extremely low (like $12) the rest of the year.*

**Water/Sewer:** $57 ($171/quarter)

**Trash:** $21 ($67/quarter)

**WiFi:** $75

**Cellphone:** $222 (my young adult kids are still on my plan. This also includes Hulu ‚Äúfree‚Äù)

**Personal Care:** $50 (body wash, deodorant, face wash, lotion, moisturizer, laundry detergent, makeup, etc)

**Car payment:** $415

**Car insurance:** $220 (I need to shop around. I don‚Äôt have any claims, but it is much higher post-divorce)

**Gas:** $120

**Other car:** $25 (oil change and annual registration)

**Lawncare:** $60 (May-October I have extreme allergies and cannot cut grass. I do snow removal myself unless it's really bad.)

**House cleaning:** $120

**Day 1, Saturday**

4 a.m. I am trying not to wake up (I suffer from mild insomnia) but no dice. I turn on the tv and watch a couple episodes of Bull. I manage to doze on and off.¬†

8:50 I make my bed, shower, put on some coffee and plan my errands for the day

9:45 I‚Äôm dressed in a handmade ribbed turtleneck and ready to do my makeup (y daily ‚Äúface‚Äù is just brows and mascara). I check in for tomorrow‚Äôs flight.

10:30 I‚Äôm out the door, coffee and banana in hand, wearing a handmade coat. I really wanted to get my hair braided, but decided I don‚Äôt want to sit for hours and I don‚Äôt want to spend a couple hundred bucks for the privilege. First stop is Sally‚Äôs for some demi-permanent color, developer, and a base coat polish so I can do my nails later. **$27.42**

I knit a shawl for my aunt and want to find a shawl pin or brooch that goes with it. I search Marshall‚Äôs and Nordstrom Rack but come up empty.¬†

Next stop is Trader Joe‚Äôs. I buy some frozen goods and some other basics; tea, granola, rice, beans, and chickpeas. **$44.56**

I walk over to H&M to find a cute top for the Usher concert. I find two that I love. I take a green halter in a M and a black crop in a L to the dressing room. I can barely get the M on my body! I return it to the rack and grab the XL without trying it on. I get home and it is several INCHES too big! Grr! **$21.52** ($39.51 but I‚Äôll return the XL top -$17.99)

I find an antique mall nearby and spend some time walking all the stalls. I find the PERFECT brooch for my aunt (plus a cute pin for me for $4!). **$24.11**¬†

I hit Target for a few more food basics and some personal care needs (brow liner, EoS shave cream, and a travel bottle of baby shampoo). I have a case of blepharitis and diluted baby shampoo is a recommended treatment. **$34.35**

When I‚Äôm in this area, it is hard for me to resist the one fast food place I still frequent - White Castle! I get two cheeseburgers and a medium fry and head home. **$7.67**

2:30-5 I color, wash, deep condition, blow dry and flat iron my hair (WHEW!). I shower and put on a long, black knit dress (handmade of course!) with tights, black booties, and gold jewelry.¬†

I leave home around 5:15 to pick up my cousin for the party. We arrive at 6. It was a surprise party, and she was she completely caught off guard!¬†It was awesome!

I drop my cousin off and am back home by 9:45, wash my face, and start preparing for tomorrow‚Äôs flight.¬†

Dishes are washed, bag is packed, a couple episodes of The Lincoln Lawyer are downloaded and I‚Äôm in bed by 10:45.¬†

**Day 1 Total: $159.43**

**Day 2, Sunday**

My alarm goes off at 6.¬† Just as I wake up, I decide to make a swap in my bag. I get out of bed, exchange one pair of pants for another, and realize I didn‚Äôt put facial moisturizer in my quart bag. Oops!¬† I make my bed, put on coffee, and hop in the shower.¬†

I drink my coffee while getting ready, putting the second cup to a to-go mug for the drive to the airport.¬†

I leave home at 7:15 and by 8:00 I‚Äôm through security. Since I have so much extra time, I consider buying a book but nothing catches my eye. I buy a water $3.50 and a maple donut from Dunkin $2.27. I only eat half the donut (it‚Äôs so sweet!!) and toss the rest.¬†

11:20 landed! My friend A is waiting for me at the airport.¬†

12:30 We hit up a spot for breakfast and I treat. **$54.91**

We hang out, doing hours of window shopping and head to a friend‚Äôs house, C, around 3:15. We stop at Starbucks and I get a small iced coffee. A pays.¬†

We chill at C‚Äôs house watching Sunday football and then tv shows (Queer Eye and Beauty in Black) and head out at 10:15 back to A‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a 45-minute drive and I‚Äôll for sure hit the bed right away.¬†

**Day 2 Total: $60.68**

**Day 3, Monday (Concert day!)**

I wake up around 7:30. A has an early hair appointment so I plan to kick back and relax, and binge watch the dumpster fire that is Love is Blind.¬†

Her appointment was pushed back so I UberEats some Starbucks ‚Äî plain black coffee and a breakfast sandwich for me, some crazy mango something or another concoction and an impossible sandwich for A. **$39.21**

A leaves her for her appointment. I eat my breakfast sandwich and coffee and watch LIB.¬†

At 10, my 4-year old grandson calls me on FT. He‚Äôs a super extrovert compared to his parents and needs multiple outlets and I am happy to oblige. We spend about 30 minutes chatting, telling stories, and playing pretend.¬†

Around 11, I shower and get dressed, let the dog out, and watch more LIB.¬†

Around 12:30 I reheat pizza from last night and before I know it, I‚Äôm asleep on the couch.¬†

3:00 I‚Äôm awake and A is on her way back. She asks if I‚Äôm hungry but I‚Äôm not yet. We talk about her hair and the rest of her birthday plans for the week.¬†

At 4:30, a school friend I haven‚Äôt seen in 30 years(!) stops by. We‚Äôre friends on social media and keep in touch that way, but we haven‚Äôt been in the same space since 1995.¬†

At 6:15 we start getting ready for the concert and are out the door by 7. A pays the $40 for parking.

The show is beautiful and amazing and after standing, singing, and dancing for 3 hours straight, I‚Äôm tired!¬†

I see the ‚ÄúT-shirt guy‚Äù in the parking lot and buy a tee for my daughter.¬† **$20**

We hit White Castle afterwards and I treat. **$22**

**Day 3 Total: $81.21**

**Day 4, Tuesday**

I‚Äôm up at 6 am and we‚Äôre out the door by 6:30. We‚Äôre about 20 minutes from the airport when I get an alert that my flight is delayed, so now we have an hour to kill.¬†We stop for breakfast at a mom & pop spot and it was delicious! My share is **$26.77**¬†

Once at the airport, I spring for a bottle of Fiji because I absolutely feel hung-over from being up so late despite not having a drop of alcohol. **$7.30**

Back home, I work for a few hours and while on a department-wide Zoom, I fall asleep for a good 10 minutes üò≠(oops! But my camera was off!). Once the meeting concludes, I check emails and chats, shut down, and take a nap.¬†

I wake up at 5:30 and decide on dinner. Shout out to past me for getting some quick bites from Trader Joe‚Äôs. 

I remember that my tire pressure light came on and head out to get air before it gets dark. **$2.50**¬†I get gas at another gas station **$44.15**

I go to a small market and pick up a few veggies for a roast - parsnips, broccoli, beets and a shallot. I thought I had carrots too but my receipt says I didn‚Äôt get them. Oops. **$7.37**

I come home and prep the veggies for roasting. Once they‚Äôre done, I pop three TJs vegetable samosas in the toaster oven. All this while watching a faculty panel discussion on the 2024 election.¬†The panel discussion ends around 8:30. I watch 1.5 episodes of Lincoln Lawyer, make my tea, and head to bed.¬†

**Day 4 Total: $88.09**

**Day 5, Wednesday**

Today is an in-office day. My alarm goes off at 6:15 and I get up after a few minutes. I make my bed and realize I have the slightest indication of a headache. Not surprising since it‚Äôs the end of the month and I ate a lot of fried foods (sodium!!) this weekend. I get up to take my migraine rescue meds.¬†

I put on a pot of coffee, turn on music on the bathroom HomePod and take a shower.¬†I iron my top and make a mental note to swap my shoes out later. It's unseasonably warm right now, but winter is coming.

I pack a Chobani, a banana, and granola for breakfast, and the leftover veggie roast and some salami and crackers for lunch. I add an apple and some mixed nuts for a snack. I‚Äôm out the door at 7:20 and arrive at my desk at 7:50.¬†

I don‚Äôt usually eat right away, but my migraine meds does some weird thing to my jaw (makes it stiff/hard to move), so I eat my yogurt, about 1/3 of the banana (it‚Äôs kind of mushy!), and granola right away before the moment passes. My coffee tastes kind of off but I‚Äôll blame that on the meds too. Womp, womp.¬†

At lunch time, I go to heat my veggies and see that some team must‚Äôve had a gathering and there‚Äôs charcuterie, hummus and pita, and cheese & crackers. Score! I leave my meat and crackers for another day and load up my plate. I snag a Reese‚Äôs cup too!

I only have about 2.5 hours of meetings today and spend a lot of time working on projects.¬†

At 4:30 my grandson calls me on FT. He wanted to tell me about his day at the park and his friend‚Äôs cool monster truck. We chat for 10 minutes and then say our goodbyes. He is so adorable!!!

I leave the office a little after 5:30 and am home before 6. Yay for completed construction!¬†I put on music and work on swapping sandals for boots and booties.¬†

Around 6:50 I head into my craft room to work on cutting out a sewing pattern. 

At 8:50, I make a small plate of salami, sharp cheddar, and TJs pita crackers, plus a bit of mixed nuts. I eat while watching Matlock (KATHY BATES!!!!!!!).¬†

I read for a little bit and at 10, I make my cup of tea and head to bed.¬†

Day 5 Total: $0

**Day 6, Thursday**

I feel semi awake for a while then notice my phone light up. That means it‚Äôs at least 6. My wfh alarm goes off at 7. At 6:30 I get up and decide to continue working on my sewing pattern. 7:30 I head out of the craft room.¬†

I make my bed, pick out my clothes (a bright, colorful handmade dress since it‚Äôs rainy and gloomy and depressing)

I water my plants then get online at 8:15. My first meeting of the day is at 8:30, but overall, I‚Äôm focused on project completion today.¬†

My body is really fighting me! I have enough prevention measures in place that I typically get one monthly (hormonal) migraine a month now. And despite having had a hysterectomy, I still get major PMS symptoms . I‚Äôm bloated and nauseous and can‚Äôt stomach any food right now.¬†

Midday and I eat some crackers and have lemon ginger tea. I also take out ground turkey to thaw for dinner.

4:30 and I wrap up the work day. I got two projects completd and off my plate today!¬†

I watch a double episode of Judy Justice and close my blinds after realizing it‚Äôs Halloween and I didn‚Äôt buy candy to pass out!¬†

It snowed today, so I really need to swap my clothes. It‚Äôs about 6 when I start my closet changeover, while watching the LIB reunion.¬†

At 7:15, a friend calls. I pause my work to talk and decide I don‚Äôt feel like cooking (I‚Äôll make my taco soup tomorrow!). We chat for a few and I head to a local Chinese food restaurant for crab rangoon and egg rolls. **$18.50**

My cousin calls while I‚Äôm out, and we chat as I‚Äôm wrapping up at the restaurant¬†

I spend way too much time this evening talking and texting with this contractor trying to finalize the details of my door installation. This company has completed work for me before, they go above and beyond and they usually come in cheaper than others, so I‚Äôm hanging in. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just a one off because I‚Äôm super frustrated. I‚Äôve been talking with him for THREE weeks about this project and now, the timing is too tight for me to order the door I want so I have to choose a stock door. The risk of putting it off is having the weather turn bad again.

I eat dinner while internet browsing and then watch an episode of Lincoln Lawyer. I make tea and head to bed around 9:30.¬†

**Day 6 Total: $18.50**  


**Day 7, Friday**

My alarm goes off at 7 and I consider lying around a bit but remember that I need to go to Menards and buy the door and lock (grr!). I save money by doing this part myself, though the contractor will pick up the door.¬†I don‚Äôt make my bed because I change my sheets on Fridays.¬†

I brush my teeth, throw on a handmade sweatshirt and sweatpants, and head out at 7:30. I spend some time looking at regular deadbolts and electronic deadbolts, and head to the door section before making a decision.¬†

I‚Äôm upset all over again that I can‚Äôt get the door that I want. It‚Äôs really pretty and would work well with my cottage-style house. I choose a somewhat-distant second best.¬† This door is about $100 cheaper so I spring for the best electronic lock. **$609**

Back home within the hour, I start coffee and log-on for work. Friday‚Äôs can be quiet and I am meeting-free! I work on a few things and start organizing some files. I talk with my mom for a bit and heat up the leftover Chinese food for lunch around 12:30.¬†

I package up the concert tee I got for my daughter and stuffie for the youngest grandkid. I‚Äôll mail it tomorrow while I‚Äôm out.¬†

Before digging back into work, I check the Nike site for a pair of shoes I tried on at the outlet mall last month. My size and preferred colorway is back in stock so I go for it. I know I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt‚Äù, but I‚Äôve been kicking myself for three weeks for not buying them. **$97**¬†

I log off for the day at 4 and watch the Peacock documentary about Alissa Turney. As soon as the story began, I recognize it from a Dateline episode.¬†

I finish putting my winter clothes away while listening to a couple episodes of The Man in the Black Mask (a Dateline series). It‚Äôs 6:15 when I finish putting everything away. I pulled out about a dozen clothing items to donate plus a pair of shoes, five clothing items and one pair of shoes to toss, and two pair of shoes to sell. They‚Äôre hardly worn and one still has its original box so hopefully they‚Äôll sell quickly on Poshmark.¬†

I still don‚Äôt have full confirmation from the contractor, so I text to ask if he‚Äôs available for a call. We set an arrival time for Saturday and he confirms that he stopped by the store to ensure the door would be ready for pickup in the morning. I wash the dishes, swap my sheets and I start my taco soup.

I take a quick shower and head to the craft room to start cutting out my sewing project.¬†

I eat dinner around 8:30 and read for a bit. And then I start watching Megan Thee Stallion‚Äôs documentary. I head to bed around 10:30.

**Day 7 Total: $706**

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

**Food + Drink: $234.06**

**Fun / Entertainment: $0 (concert tickets were $210 and purchased long ago)**

**Home + Health: $643.35 (the cash for the install was withdrawn some time ago)**

**Clothes + Beauty: $145.94**

**Transport: $46.65**

**Other: $44.11 (gifts)**

This was a higher spend week than normal. It isn‚Äôt every day you buy a new exterior door! Also, I spent a lot more on eating out than I normally would since I was traveling.

Keeping the diary also made me mindful of my dietary issues. My primary doc referred me to a dietician recently. I am supposed to be aiming for ‚Äú3 food events‚Äù per day. I just don‚Äôt feel hungry that often and am trying to be better at eating FOOD (not just snacking) a couple times a day.¬†

I suck at skincare. I keep trying to ensure I wash my face every night but I usually forget. I really do make my coffee at home every day unless I‚Äôm traveling. And I really do make my bed daily!

Otherwise, the diary was very indicative of how I spend my time. Sewing, knitting, reading, tv and movies, Dateline, and time with friends and family. I do have anxiety over the debt situation, but I‚Äôll keep plugging away. When my pay increased, I took the additional money and have it transferred for debt payoff. I‚Äôll keep living off my previous salary until I get things together. My biggest struggle isn‚Äôt really reflected here - helping my kids and other loved ones financially. It‚Äôs improving! There was a time that I would send money I literally did not have (it was money slated for something else that then caused me to put more purchases on a card), but I am now saying no, or offering to help with other solutions, more often.

Lastly, the door did NOT get installed on Saturday. I was SO MAD! But it was finally completed a few days later. I feel all sorts of relief and calm! The old door was rusted, the jamb was peeling paint, and the sill was completely rotted through.¬†

1h6ykkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSlash_YT/comments/1h6ykkx/tifu_by_letting_my_inner_thoughts_out/,TIFU by letting my inner thoughts out,"So it didn't happen today, but on Monday I was getting non-stop nitpicking from my mother about everything I said and every question I asked. To give a little back story I currently live in Florida after moving here in 2021 from the Midwest. I have no family nearby and few friends, and I wasn't completely for moving here but my parents boiled it down to either move with us of be homeless since at the time I was 19, covid just happened, and prices for rent were insane. So fast forward to me now 22, working full time, going to college full time, and participating in a competitive sport (figure skating which I had always wanted to do when I was growing up), you can imagine I do not have very much free time in between all my commitments so some things do slip and may take longer then wanted. It all boiled over Monday, I was in my car about to head home and asked my mother if she would like me to stop and get dinner since we had no groceries, a pretty normal question, she gave me a vague answer about groceries will be delivered between 6 and 8, at this point its 5pm so I asked again if she would like me to get food since its on of the nights where I have work for 2 classes that I need to do eg. lack of time to cook dinner later. She yells at me and hangs up the call, I take a deep breath and go to the  gas station to get a snack and drink to hold me over till after my studying time. At about 5:30 I remember I have to make a desert for my friend and I can whip it up in 15 minutes if I focus, so I get my whipping cream whipped and mixed with the mascarpone cheese and then I hear the doorbell ring. SUPRISE the groceries came at 5:45... great so now my mom thinks I am in her way and get angry yelling at me saying ""You knew groceries were coming"" ""I don't know why you always inconvenience me and get in my way"" and so on. I kind of ignore it trying to finish what I am doing so I can get to my homework, I go around the countertop to grab a bowl to put the espresso and coffee liqueur mixture I made for the next step in the process and as I am doing that she keeps saying things like ""you are doing it wrong"" ""that is not how your grandmother does it"" and I just say in a monotone voice ""I know what I am doing, thanks"", this repeated 3 or 4 times and she starts yelling at me telling me I am disrespectful and to get the f\*ck out of her house. This was the tipping point all the pent up anger and feelings from the last 10 years of being ignored and being told I am not good enough and that I was a mistake and she never wanted me kind of just came out. I said "" you know what, this attitude is the reason your a failed mother, a failed grandmother, and a failed wife. You are a b\*\*ch and I don't love you. I do so much and all you care about is what I didn't do."" (this is in reference to another fight we had the 2 days prior because I feel and hurt my shoulder and couldn't do the cat boxes so she was mad about that). I know what I said is mean, not kind, and rude but it kind of just spewed out like work vomit, after I finished she didn't even seem to care and told me ""pack your sh\*t and get the f\*\*k out of my house."" Like I stated I have no family and very few friends so if I was truly being kicked out it would be very bad, so I reflexively said no and she will have to evict me. I haven't received an eviction at this point but the text messages I am receiving are implying she is planning on following through at this point. A big part of why I got so angry is every time I do something I get criticized, pushed aside, and disregarded while my older sister, by 10 months, is put on a pedestal and gets everything she ever wants, and I mean everything. To paint a large picture quickly my sister moved into an apartment in 2019, I paid the deposit since they didn't have money, my mother paid the rent of $920 for a YEAR while my sister didn't work 9 out of the 12 months because she found out she was pregnant. At this moment my sister and her ""fiance"" live with us, my sister hasn't worked since she found out she was pregnant and relies on my mother and her boyfriend to pay for everything. So I make this a point every time I have a disagreement with my mother, she will say something like ""you don't clean around the house ever"" and I will say ""your daughter is home 24/7 365 days hasn't touched a dirty dish since moving here, she doesn't work and is in bed most the day"" then my mother will bring up the fact that she takes care of my niece, which to all of the stay at home moms I have the upmost respect for you because parenting is hard , however she doesn't take care of her at all. When I come home during lunch to do homework my sister is sleeping or on facetime with her cousin gossiping and starting drama or watching tv and my niece is in her bed, when I get home she's in her room playing video games or watching tv while my mother and I feed her child, watch her child, and entertain her child. All this however is ok in my mothers eyes because she sees her as the great messiah but whenever I can't help I get told what I do doesn't matter because I chose to go to school, work, and do a sport. I could tell tons of other stories and if this gets any traction and yall want more I will post more. Also hi to rslash/editor I hope your doing well as a viewer since the beginning you keep me sane. Thank you for letting me rant, love to all :)

TLDR; Mother hates me for not being perfect but lets my sister do nothing with her life and she's ok with that, also might be homeless soon... ",2,1733366040.0,rSlash_YT,0,0.75,False

At some point, I discovered two of his favorite restaurants were Waffle House and Cracker Barrel. This would come up sometimes and we would laugh about it. 

I mean, they‚Äôre not even PF Chong‚Äôs level. (Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, Waffle House hashbrowns are bangin).

Anyway, one time I was at Cracker Barrel with a friend and I thought I had a hilarious idea to buy him something with the CB logo on it. I ended up picking out the ugliest coffee mug they had (shaped like a barrel). I thought it was funny! 

I warned him before he opened it that it was a silly, joke gift so he would set his expectations accordingly. As he opened it, I explained that I envisioned him spotting it randomly around his office, sitting by the sink next to all the attractive mugs‚Äîsurely it would make him think of me and laugh! But he quickly and roughly shoved it back into the bag before I could even finish my sentence. My stomach dropped. I felt so dumb and embarrassed. 

Of course, he accidentally left it behind at the hotel but I didn‚Äôt say anything because his feelings about it were clear. 
It lived in my car for a while after that, rolling around in the bag on the floorboard‚Ä¶until I finally returned it and got my $12 back dammit!

So, learn from my mistake: if your SD is lacking a sense of humor, don‚Äôt buy him an ugly mug from Cracker Barrel. 

Or, maybe, don‚Äôt have him as your SD in the first place? ü§î

thank you to everyone who commented. The consensus seemed to be that Jake is either a terrible snake parent or is trying to start shit, neither of which is okay.  

For those of you who suggested that I buy a mini fridge and move the makeshift morgue somewhere safe with a lock, it turns out I didn't have to do that. 

I'm a pretty independent person, and I don't like to bother people, so I don't always reach out for help when I need it, which is probably why I didn't think of doing this on my own. 

My BF, let's call him Allen (31M), has been busy studying for finals as he's getting his certification, so I have been giving him space to focus on that. We text each other daily, but I don't want to bombard him with messages or vent about my issues when he's already stressed and overworked, so it didn't even occur to me to reach out to him for help. 

However, he messaged me today wanting to go for a coffee because he had a little time and he ""missed me"" (his words, not mine). While we were hanging out, I broke down and told him everything. (you know, when you think you're keeping it together until someone asks, ""Are you okay?"" and you just lose it? Yeah, that was me).

 Allen got really quiet. He's a chill and soft-spoken guy. In the few months I've known him, I've never seen him angry, but let me tell you, he was boiling. He stood up, looked me dead in the eye, and said, ""Get up, we're going to your place. You can keep her in my freezer."" 

My roommate was at work, so there wasn't any big dramatic showdown like I'm sure everyone was fiending for; he just marched into the kitchen, gently took the box out of the freezer, and took it to his car. I will be picking up the deceased at his place this weekend before I drive to my parents. 

Before he left, he gave me a big hug, kissed my forehead, and told me as soon as finals are over, I'm going to be sick to death of him because he's not letting me out of his sight until next semester. I was a bit embarrassed because this is my first serious relationship, and I'm not used to having someone act like they actually like me, but I just quietly held onto him and felt safe for the first time in a few days. I'm always sad to see him go, but this time it felt even harder.

As for moving out, I won't need to be doing that. My roommate has a job lined up in another town, and she will be leaving in a few months of her own accord, so I just need to wait. 

TL;DR: Jams' body is in safe hands, and I will not have to deal with Jake or my roommate for much longer. Thank you again, everyone!",64,1733365692.0,MarkNarrations,8,0.99,False

I‚Äôve been in the kratom industry for over 12yrs and own the worlds only GMP certified kratom processing center. I mostly work with wholesalers so I don‚Äôt get to hear many customer stories.

A few years ago my company started manufacturing 7OH and now we sell bulk 7OH to a majority of the top retailers. I don‚Äôt really have any questions besides wanting to know your story and if 7OH has helped you in any way. 

What I hope to learn: 
How did you start using kratom or 7OH? 
How often and how much 7OH do you use everyday?
Do you think that the current 7OH tablets available are too weak? 
What would price do you pay for your 7OH tablets?
Do you have any health issues or withdrawal effects if you don‚Äôt use 7OH? 


About me: 
I came to use kratom after realizing I had a drinking problem‚Ä¶ I got arrested and was put on probation, I lost my kids, I lost my baby mama, and I had to move in with my mom. I used kratom to quit alcohol and marijuana. Now I use kratom in the morning in place of coffee. Kratom saved my life and has helped me make better decisions everyday because I‚Äôm basically sober. I know I‚Äôm not technically but you get it. 


I really hope to make a connection with some of you. I love this community and would love to answer any of your questions. ",2,1733365467.0,7oh,5,1.0,False

It changes how one pays for a cup of coffee, and it enables supply chain management for global corporations in ways most people will never notice.

Think about it: a transaction took more than a few days to settle, and loyalty points from one retailer could not be used elsewhere. Blockchain is razing all those inefficiencies, bringing transparency, security, and interoperability. It's the technology enabling microtransactions in digital games, letting artists sell NFTs without intermediaries taking a cut, and helping confirm that the fair-trade certification on your morning coffee is kosher.

But blockchain isn't just about that small stuff; it's also driving megatrends-whole industries at their tipping point. Decentralized finance changes the way people think about traditional banking; smart contracts automate legal agreements. Whether you're a crypto head or just someone who has overheard more conversations than they can count about blockchain, get ready to see just how this game-changing tech is more a part of your everyday life than you think.

Revolutionizing Payments with Microtransactions

Most importantly, blockchain allows for seamless, low-fee microtransactions. In other systems, high transaction fees make processing small payments impracticable. Blockchain removes this obstacle by offering networks like Bitcoin Lightning and Ethereum Layer 2 solutions that facilitate the real-time movement of funds at low costs.

These innovations have begun changing the game from the gaming to the creation industries. Gamers collect value through in-game currencies, exchangeable into cryptocurrencies, while content creators are monetized directly through platforms like Coil, which utilize blockchain technology in support of micropayments for premium content.

NFTs and the Case of Empowerment through Ownership:

Non-fungible tokens have taken over the world and changed the very meaning of ownership, even if they exist on the digital plane. Be it art, music, or virtual real estate, NFTs finally give creators a method of monetizing their work.

Everything from NFTs being utilized for the most mundane to finding real applications in our day-to-day lives for all sorts of things, from event tickets to loyalty programs, the authenticity of even the tokenized real-world properties will be assured, and transfers will be made seamless. For example, NBA Top Shot has pioneered a revolution in the sports collectible space and caused mainstream adoption of blockchain-based digital trading cards.

Decentralising Finance for All:

Defi is one of the most workable use cases for blockchain. It would allow lending, borrowing, and trading via a platform with the exclusion of conventional intermediaries like banks. The democratization of financial tools can be made in such a way that even the most backward areas get a chance to participate in the world economy.

This enables users to gain interest on, trade, and borrow against their assets without intermediaries.

Supply Chain Transparency and Everyday Trust

It's really a revolution of the supply chain, letting real-time transparency flood the space. Everything from the origin tracing of food items to authenticity in luxury products gives the consumer a trust never shown before.

For example, IBM Food Trust enables consumers to trace groceries right back to a farm for questions related to safety and quality. Business transparency will be in very high demand when consumers begin to ask more questions about brands' ethics and their contribution to sustainability.

Conclusion:

NCOG Earth Chain allows for low-fee and energy-efficient microtransactions. It will also support large-scale initiatives such as supply chains or green energy trading.

From payments to ownership, finance to supply chains, the many facets of life that blockchain touches are unmistakable. Yet, as this technology further matures, it will unleash much more, making blockchain no longer just a technologist's tool but part of all people's day-to-day experiences. Blockchain is all about building a future wherein, through technology, people are empowered to do things that have never been imagined-from microtransactions up to megatrends.

¬†Sunday 8:14 P.M.¬†

I slouched in my chair, and rolled my eyes as I read Marcus's newspaper about the recent string of murders, and missing kids. Marcus had been a new guy working here at Oakland local newspaper, and it said on his resume that he had worked for different news outlets in the past, but this paper was unacceptable. So I yelled, ‚ÄúMarcus come to my office now!‚Äù I heard footsteps coming toward my office, and soon Marcus appeared. ‚ÄúCome Marcus sit!‚Äù I said. He came and sat in front of me and almost immediately seemed really nervous. ‚ÄúMarcus I wanted to talk to you about this,‚Äù I said as I slapped his paper down onto my desk in front of him. ‚ÄúU- -u -uh I‚Äôm sorry miss Rebecca,‚Äù He said as he started to sweat. ‚ÄúUh what's wrong Marcus?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI just have a lot of stuff going on at home, and I don‚Äôt want to be fired for one bad paper that was rushed,‚Äù He said as his sweat dripped down onto his t-shirt. ‚ÄúOh no I‚Äôm not gonna fire you for one bad paper we‚Äôre human we make mistakes. I get it. I've made some bad papers too. It's just yours is really bad you're making a show out of the murders, and missing kids like it‚Äôs a goddamn movie. I can‚Äôt have that here. Okay that‚Äôs all I wanted to talk to you about. Okay just don‚Äôt do that it‚Äôs a little screwed up to do that. Oh and regarding your question for me. Ask away,‚Äù I said as Marcus sighed in relief. ‚ÄúWell I have plans with my friends to go to the bar, so I wanted to ask if I could leave early?‚Äù Marcus asked. ‚ÄúUh Marcus your shift ended 2 hours ago why are you asking me to leave. Just go party with your friends, just make sure to clock out at the machine,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúOkay thanks Rebecca,‚Äù Marcus said as he stood up and started out. ‚ÄúYep no problem Marcus just make sure to not make your next paper like your first please,‚Äù I said. I turned to look at my office phone to check my missed calls, one from Anna. I realized I forgot to call her about if I could go to the diner, so I put her phone number in. It rang for a few seconds before she picked it up. Anna Asked, ‚ÄúHello Rebecca is this you?‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúYes this is me, and I think I‚Äôll be able to make it okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù She said. I continued, ‚ÄúWhat time were you thinking?‚Äù She replied, ‚ÄúUh how about 12:00. I know that‚Äôs late, so if you can't, that's fine.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs a good time for me, it'll give me like an extra few hours to finish signing the papers.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay thanks, see you soon. Bye.‚Äù ‚ÄúBye‚Äù I hung up the phone, and grabbed one of the 3 large stacks of papers. I started to go through them. Throwing away the junk, and keeping the important papers. Annoyed, I said, ‚ÄúUgh this is gonna take a few hours.‚Äù I sat back in my chair, and rolled my eyes.¬†

  
  






¬†Andrea¬†

Sunday 8:40 P.M.¬†

I woke up to my loud, and obnoxious ringing next to my ears. Mom must have set it up while I was taking my nap. I was so glad that I had my outfit already picked out, and ready to go for the movies. When I got up I looked to see if it was still there, and it was. On my dresser was my new casual white dress with short sleeves, and my matching white high heels. I grabbed it, and put it on. After I was done putting on my outfit I began brushing my hair, and then curling it. Now the only thing left to do was makeup, so just put on some red lipstick, pink blush, black eye shadow, and black eyeliner wings. I looked at the clock, and it said, 8:49. It was time to go pick up Kyra. I pick up my purse, and start toward the door. Once I was downstairs I was startled by Sarah running at me, while squealing. Excitedly, she hugged me and said, ‚ÄúYou look so pretty Andrea.‚Äù ‚ÄúThanks. You can let me go now okay.‚Äù She lets go, and walks away with a sad look on her face. ‚ÄúHey where is mom?‚Äù I asked. She replied, ‚ÄúShe left to work a few minutes ago.‚Äù I wave bye, and say, ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm leaving to go to the movies okay.‚Äù I walked out the door, and started toward Kyra‚Äôs house.¬†

  


While walking toward Kyra‚Äôs house I remembered the time when Alex came to the school. It was the first day of 7th grade, I was sitting next to Kyra, and then the principal came in with Alex. He had shaggy Brown hair, was wearing tight blue jeans, a partly buttoned up¬† plaid shirt that was dark, red, and green, and under that was a white polo. He sat next to Kyra, and kept his head down as the principal walked out. At lunch Kyra had invited him to sit with us since he had nowhere to sit. Kyra, and Alex became friends, but slowly Kyra began to hangout with me less. Instead she hung out with Alex more, and more everyday. I was jealous, and angry over the next month of them being friends, so one day I did something that I would really regret. I went up to Alex, and angrily said, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you stay away from Kyra, and go back to where you came from!‚Äù I punched him in the arm, and accidentally broke it. I was suspended for two weeks, and Kyra refused to talk to me for a month before I went up to Alex, and apologized. Alex, and I made up, and actually became good friends. Kyra started to talk to me again, and we all would hangout all the time.¬†

  
  


When I got to Kyra‚Äôs house I saw her dad was gone, and someone‚Äôs car was parked in her driveway. I knocked on her door, and was met with Chloe. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here Andrea?‚Äù She asked. I replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to pick up Kyra. Do you know where she is?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah she‚Äôs upstairs. She got into trouble with the babysitter. Kyra came down here and Andrea's here.‚Äù I heard a door fly open followed by footsteps, and then I saw her. She was wearing black spandex pants, a black shirt with a skull on it, black high heels, and her backpack. Her backpack always had her safety kits, and things like that. Kyra was only wearing black eye shadow, and black eyeliner that made her brown eyes stand out. She had her brunette hair in a ponytail that went down to the bottom of her head, and her long bangs. She stepped outside, slammed the door, hugged me, and almost immediately after that she started crying. ‚ÄúIt's gonna be okay. I promise.‚Äù I reassured her. ‚ÄúWhat if he‚Äôs dead?‚Äù She asked. I replied, ‚ÄúThey're gonna find him okay, and everything will be okay.‚Äù Kyra let go, and started toward the theater, which was only 2 blocks away. I followed, and said, ‚ÄúHey let‚Äôs go have fun okay, and forget about everything just for tonight okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù she replied. The streets were dark except for the sparsely placed streetlights. Trying to lighten the mood I said, ""Hey I know the police are gonna find Alex, and then we‚Äôre gonna all be together again okay.‚Äù She nodded and smiled and seemed happier throughout the night.¬†

It was an hour after my dad got home from the bar, I had to let the dog outside, and I was hungry. I started down the stairs, skipping every other step since it was so weirdly fun for me. I heard our dog, Sunny, is a 5 year old golden retriever, barking. When I got downstairs I tripped over Whiskers, one of our cats was a kitten while Smoky our other cat was 7 years old. ‚ÄúOuch! Sorry Whiskers.‚Äù After that I went into the living room to find dad watching television with a beer in his hands. Suddenly he turned his head toward me, stared at me,and said, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing up, honey?‚Äù So I responded, ‚ÄúUh mom wanted me to let out Sunny before Andrea got back from the movies. But I also was gonna make myself dinner.‚Äù He got up, ‚ÄúWell I guess I could make us both dinner, and we could eat in the living room, and watch some television.‚Äù ‚ÄúWait really dad,‚Äù I said as he walked me out of the living room. ‚ÄúReally honey just go let out Sunny I‚Äôll make us sandwiches, chip,‚Äù Dad said. I asked, ‚ÄúAnd pickles?‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd pickles,‚Äù Dad replied. I giggled, as I called for Sunny, and walked toward the backdoor. That‚Äôs when I had an amazing thought‚Ä¶ I should play with Sunny outside after she gets done using the bathroom. So I said, ‚ÄúDaddy can I play outside with Sunny after she gets done using the bathroom while you‚Äôre making supper?‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúSure why not.‚Äù So I replied, ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù ‚ÄúCalm down a little. Okay,‚Äù Dad said. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I replied. I opened the door to hear Smoky meowing as she ran outside. Smoky was an outdoorsy cat. Half the time she‚Äôs outside, and the other half she‚Äôs sleeping from being exhausted from being outside. She is our special little Smoky. It's crazy how active she is at 7 years old. I see Sunny running toward me,¬† when she gets to me she licks me, and then runs outside. Immediately she uses the bathroom, and then I grab her ball. I said, ‚ÄúHey Sunny you wanna play?‚Äù She barked. I threw her ball, and she went inside. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said disappointed. I walked inside to find dad done with the food. He handed me a plate, and we walked into the living room. When he turned on the television ‚ÄúTom and Jerry‚Äù, a funny part came up,which made me laugh. I sat down on our couch, (which was right next to my dad‚Äôs recliner) and we started eating. ‚ÄúHow have you been Sarah honey,‚Äù Dad said. So I responded, ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good,‚Äù Dad said as he picked up a beer, and started drinking it. I asked,‚ÄùAre you gonna quit drinking beer?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on it. In fact I‚Äôm gonna go to a place next weekend, and stay there, but when I get back I won‚Äôt be drinking,‚Äù Dad said as he took another sip.¬†

  
  


When we were done my dad asked me to go put the dishes in the sink. So I walked toward it passing a meowing Whiskers, and into the dimly lit kitchen to put the dishes in the sink. I looked outside to see something very eerie‚Ä¶ Someone in a white van with no windows (except for the front which had windows) was staring directly at me from the parked van on our neighbors driveway. I dropped down to the floor, because I didn‚Äôt do well with scary stuff. Once I felt safe I ran into the living room with chills running down my spine. 

Andrea¬†

Monday 12:00 A.M.¬†¬†

When I walked into my house I was met with a foul odor. Instantly I knew it was alcohol. I squeezed my nose shut as I walked toward the living room. When I got there I was met with an unsurprising sight. There on his recliner passed out drunk, my dad, Bob with Sunny laying down by him. He had the television on, and the little coffee table next to him had about 10 beer cans on it. He had became a drunk after his friend died. Before he started drinking my dad was tall, and muscular, but he gained a lot of weight. I went over to my dad, grabbed the remote, turned the television off, and began cleaning the house. I grabbed the mop from the corner and began mopping the living room. After that I started toward the cat room which was a room for the cats to get food, water, and a litter box for them to use the bathroom. The door of the cat room had a hole on the bottom so they could get in easily. It was right next to the basement door which was in the kitchen. When I looked around the kitchen I knew Sarah had gotten dinner. The bread was out along with the pickles, and lunch meat. I opened the cat room, grabbed food, and poured it into their bowls. Immediately Whiskers was running, meowing every few seconds. When I finished the living room I moved onto the kitchen. After a little while of cleaning the kitchen I heard Sarah running down the stairs. She continued toward me with her arms wide open. Sarah wrapped her arms around me in a warm embrace. Sarah‚Äôs hugs always cheered me up no matter what. ‚ÄúI missed you Andrea. It was terrifying without you!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy did something happen?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre watching,‚Äù Sarah replied as she pointed out the kitchen window. I turned around toward the sink which was below the window to see what Sarah was pointing at, it was a white van with no windows. There were 2 people inside with some kind of masks‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre staring right at us! A chill went down my spine. ‚ÄúFuck this. Sarah, go lock the backdoor now! Is Smoky inside?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Andrea.‚Äù ‚ÄúOk I‚Äôm going to get her, I'll be right back,‚Äù I reassured Sarah as she went to the backdoor. Suddenly I heard Sarah scream in pure terror. I ran to her to see what she screamed about. It was a symbol with a deer on the clear glass. Then I realized‚Ä¶ It was drawn with blood! I runned to the kitchen, Grabbed our biggest knife, and put it in my pocket. I ran outside, and started screaming for Smoky to no evail. ‚ÄúSmoky where are you!‚Äù I screeched. I started toward the road, when‚Ä¶ A police car races by with its sirens blaring. I stumbled onto the sidewalk, and watched them go down the road until they took a left turn onto a different road. That‚Äôs when I noticed the white van was on the driveway of the neighbors across the street. I¬† ¬† ¬† started toward the van, pulling out the knife from my pocket. When I got to the van I banged on the window, and said, ‚ÄúHey asshole cut it out!‚Äù But there was no one in the van, but there was a map. I looked closer at the map‚Ä¶ There was an x on the map.¬† I opened the van and grabbed the map. The x was drawn with a red marker, and the x was on my house. ‚ÄúShit!‚Äù I screamed as I raced off toward my house.¬†

  


When I got inside I realized that something was off. My mom‚Äôs cheese grater was missing, and the basement door was slightly open. I put the knife in my pocket again. ‚ÄúUh Sarah come here!‚Äù Sarah runs out from the living room. ‚ÄúWhat were you doing in the living room, and did you open the basement door?‚Äù ‚ÄúI was closing the window you opened, and no I didn‚Äôt open the basement door.‚Äù ‚ÄúWait, I didn't open any windows. Stay behind me,‚Äù I said as I started towards the basement doors. Suddenly‚Ä¶ Something big and black was thrown out from the basement, I fell, startled, I got up and went up to the black thing, and picked it up. It was smoky‚Äôs limp body. I screamed as the basement doors swung open, someone grabbed me, threw me downstairs, and I screamed, ‚ÄúSarah Run!‚Äù I caught a glimpse of them as I fell, and hit my head. They were wearing a green robe that had a lot of wear and tear to it, and a buck deer mask, with short antlers. It was the people from the white van!

  
  
  




  


¬†¬†Sarah¬†

¬†Monday 12:30 A.M.

The moment Andrea was thrown downstairs I booked it toward the front door, but when I opened the door I was met with a man in a deer mask with antlers, and a tattered green robe with wear and tear holding an axe. I ran away toward dad, screaming for help. When I got to the living room I screamed, ‚ÄúDaddy help me they have an axe, and are gonna kill us! HELP!‚Äù He didn‚Äôt wake up until I shook him. I screamed, ‚ÄúHelp!!‚Äù He got up and looked up to see the man with the axe. Dad raises his fists, and starts swinging his fists at the man. The man brought up the ax, but my dad maneuvered it out of his hands, and it hit the ground next to me. I looked over to my dad to see he‚Äôs losing the fight, so I grab a beer bottle, go to the man, and try to hit his head, but he grabs it. He pushed my dad down, but my dad started swinging his fists again. He yelled, ‚ÄúRun Sarah!‚Äù The man pushed my dads head back, and began bringing down the beer bottle on him. Then he used his other hand to open dad‚Äôs mouth, and began shoving it down his throat. Dad swung his hands desperately, and the man just pushed deeper. Dad tried to gurgle, but it came out as a croak, and suddenly white vomit started coming out of his mouth. I screamed, ‚ÄúNO DADDY!‚Äù Then dad‚Äôs eyes rolled into the back of his head, and he went limp. I just stood there in shock for a minute. I turned around, screaming for help, and then I jumped out of the open window but I was grabbed, yanked inside, and thrown onto the floor. The man grabbed a needle with a blue liquid, and injected it into my neck as I squrimed, and tried to scream, but I became tired all of a sudden. I tried to fight back my sleepiness, but it became stronger, after a while I gave up, and gave in. I closed my eyes, and everything went black.

  
  


¬†¬†Andrea¬†

¬† Monday 12:30 A.M.

When I hit the ground I heard a loud‚Ä¶ snap! I tried to get up, but my leg was hurting. So I looked at it‚Ä¶ My leg was broken, my leg bone sticking out. I screamed in terror, and suddenly I heard footsteps descending downstairs toward me. I pull myself forward, inching just a little bit to be hidden, so I can sneak attack them, and have a chance of surviving. I see their shadow, take off my heels, they're in the basement with me now‚Ä¶ I inch away from the shadow, and toward a window. I hid behind a table as they turned on a flashlight. He would catch me if I didn‚Äôt do something. I looked around, and saw our crawl space, it was just big enough for me to fit, so I grabbed a can from beside me, and threw it toward the window. He goes over to it, and I take as my Que to drag myself toward the crawl space. Suddenly‚Ä¶ The knife falls out of my pocket and bangs onto the floor.I grabbed the knife as he turned me over. ‚ÄúShit!‚Äù I dragged myself as he ran over, but I wasnt gonna make it, so I grabbed one of my heels and stabbed him in the leg multiple times. He falls to the floor as I go over to him, and about to stab him again when I hear someone coming down the stairs, so I book it toward the crawl space. I reached the crawl space just as they got downstairs, it was another one of them. They look toward the crawl space, so I get right up behind the entrance so they don‚Äôt see me if they look inside. They crouch down as I put my hands over my mouth and nose, and hold my breath. They stayed there, looking in. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to hold my breath much longer. He wasn‚Äôt moving I was fucked! I tried to hold it for longer, but I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I took a long breath, and they started swinging their fists inside the crawl space. I dodged their punchs, before they suddenly stopped, and their shadow disappeared. I sighed in relief, and just sat there. BOOM! The wall I‚Äôm resting on caves in, and I fell onto the floor next to the wall. Before I could react they grabbed onto a piece of my hair, and yanked me through the hole they created. I screamed in pain, and saw they had ripped a chunk of my hair. They had a needle with a blue liquid in it, and tried to stick it in my neck, but I knocked it out of their hand. I crawled back in, and I started down the crawl space toward the exit (which had an alternate exit which led you to the outside of the house in the front yard.) I crawled as fast as I could toward the vent which was the exit, and then I could crawl to Kyra‚Äôs house. She was only a block away. I continued on until I saw the vent. Then suddenly, ‚ÄúHey you stupid bitch get back here!‚Äù I looked back to see the man that had just attacked me. He was unmasked, and coming for me, and fast. I crawl faster, and faster as he gets closer to me. When I got to the vent I grabbed out my knife, and began unscrewing it. The man was hidden in the shadows till he was about 100 feet away. It was a young asian man around 20-30 years old, who had brown eyes that looked almost black, and a small mustache. ‚ÄúYou stop right there you little shit,‚Äù The man yelled as I got done screwing the 2nd screw. I began working on the 3rd going as fast as I could, but he was now almost 20 feet away. When I got done screwing the 3rd one he was 10 feet away. I began on the final one, as he got closer. He was 5 feet away now, and I was only halfway done screwing in the last screw. He was now 2 feet away, and that‚Äôs when he grabbed me, and dragged me closer to him. I kicked and kicked but I dropped my knife. I had to do something, and now! So I looked around for something to hit him with as he tried to stick the needle in my neck, but I put my hand on his eyes, and squeezed. He dropped down and screamed, ‚ÄúOw! You little bitch!‚Äù I dragged myself foward as he groaned, I grabbed the knife, and continued unscrewing it. He got up and crawled at a running speed as I kicked open the vent, and began crawling out. He grabbed me again, so I kicked him in the face.¬†

  
  


When I got out I saw them dragging Sarah out, and they put her in the van which they parked in our driveway. I dragged my body forward as quietly as I could. Every time I moved the grass squeaked, and it felt a hundred times louder than usual. That‚Äôs when I realized‚Ä¶ They were the people on the news that were kidnapping family‚Äôs kids. ‚ÄúHey the other girls over here!‚Äù The man yelled. They turned their heads over, and I dragged myself faster and faster, but they were catching up! ‚ÄúHelp me! They're trying to-‚Äù One of them puts a hand over my mouth, whispers menacingly , ‚ÄúShut up or slit your throat you little bitch!‚Äù I started to cry as they turned me over, and they said, ‚ÄúGet me the needle!‚Äù ‚ÄúNo! Please don‚Äôt!‚Äù ‚ÄúI told you to shut up‚Äù They slapped me across the face, and it hurt like hell. One of the other ones brings over a needle, and they inject me in the neck with it. With one last attempt I kicked them in the balls with my good leg, and they fell to the ground. I started dragging myself toward the sidewalk, but suddenly a wave of tiredness washed over me. I tried fighting it, but it was too strong. I fell asleep, and everything went black.¬†

1h6y9aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectDiablo2/comments/1h6y9aj/a_berless_night_the_short_story/,A Ber-less Night (the short story),"This morning, I woke up and got ready for work. As I went about the menial tasks of morning hygiene, my mind wandered to the Ber rune that I found the night before. I am still fairly early in my Solo Self Found (SSF) journey for this season. My star player is a functional level 87 Teeth Necro making his way through early mapping.

I left my apartment thinking about all the ways I could use a Ber rune in this play through. Which builds will I try? Do I want an early Infinity, or should I go with a Beast instead? My 30-minute commute ended and it was time to focus on work. The work day progressed as usual -- casual conversation with coworkers, an overview of what we will all focus on throughout the day, and a fresh pot of coffee in the break room. I poured a cup of generic medium roast coffee when an unsettling thought emerged.

""Did I dream that a Ber rune dropped, or did it actually drop?""

At first, I dismissed the possibility that it was only a dream. Certainly, it dropped. Otherwise, why would I have spent my morning thinking it had dropped when it had not? Why would I have wasted the precious time imagining its various purposes and ways that it could expedite my path to power and glory?

Throughout my work day I was re-visited by the thought of a Ber-less night numerous times. By the time I completed my daily tasks and got into my car for another commute home, I accepted the fact that I may have never encountered the Ber rune after all. After this acceptance, I girded myself by focusing on the positive aspects of an SSF journey. There are still so many other possibilities of items and runes that can drop! I will be able to create something powerful no matter what!

My thoughts progress beyond PD2 to a more urgent need ‚Äì dinner. I re-heat a bowl of left over pasta and enjoy the simple sustenance as I scroll through posts online. I see a post of an unslammed and unidentified Unique Sacred Armor! Alas‚Ä¶ the item was turned into the mason‚Äôs unit. A brick -- to be added to the cornerstone of corruption.

My Ber! I forget to check for my Ber! I immediately launch PlugY and start a game on my Necromancer named TIERLISTLORD. I check my inventory! I check my stash! There is no Ber. I will not allow a moment of pity. I already assured myself that I would not be dissuaded from power, no matter what.

It‚Äôs time to run a map. The grind has to start somewhere. There will be no Bers, Surs, Tirs, or otherwise if I don‚Äôt set my eager TIERLISTLORD to the mission of crushing the demonic opposition. The map has Stygian Dolls, but I will grind them with my Teeth nonetheless. I press the enemy methodically, Warping Blood to move myself across the battlefield. Legions die at my conjuration of Teeth. The celebration of Halloween has only barely passed, increasing the destructive properties of my summoned projectiles.

Amidst the chaos of battle, a Ber rune drops! I can hardly fathom. The thing that evaporated from certainty is now in front of me. I‚Äôm awake at the end of a tiresome day, but it displays itself to me now in plain sight. After quickly finishing the map, I place the rune in its proper position in my stash. I exit the game and load up a fresh match, to make certain the rune is there. Right in the 30^(th) rune‚Äôs place, my Ber rune stands true. The possibilities that I dreamt of in the morning are now absolute.

My day concludes and I lay my head to rest. The only question that teases my fatigued mind at the edge of the night is this:

We had crazy chemistry and we were both very physically attracted to each other. We went on a date (coffee and a walk) and ended up making out and stuff‚Ä¶a lot. Not typical of me at all but like I said we just really clicked. Anyway, he wanted me to go back to his place and I told him no and that I was still a virgin and didn‚Äôt want my first time to be with someone I barely knew etc. He was surprised but pretty chill about it, told me he would be happy to fix that. I declined. Anyway we kept messaging that day and into the next (my last day there) and we decided to meet up again before I left the next morning. So I went over to his place and one thing led to another and long story short I‚Äôm no longer a virgin. I left the next morning and figured he‚Äôd ghost me because he got what he wanted but he didn‚Äôt. He messaged me on and off the next couple of weeks, sometimes casual stuff other times more flirty/explicit stuff. After returning home I couldn‚Äôt quite get him out of my head and he would randomly message me as soon as I started to get over him a little. It was really messing with my head, especially because I knew he wasn‚Äôt the type to want a relationship or anything. Also I got a ton of judgement from some people who told me he was only using me and I shouldn‚Äôt ever speak to again blah blah blah. So after a few weeks I messaged him and told him I couldn‚Äôt keep talking to him because I was having a hard time moving on. He said he understood and something to the effect of wishing me well etc. Then I deleted our chat and blocked him because I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt have much self control if he‚Äôd message me again and I also didn‚Äôt want to keep rereading our convo when I thought about him. Anyway, it‚Äôs been a couple of months and I regret cutting off communication.  
Idk if it was our connection or losing my v card to him or what but I just wish we were still in touch. I unblocked him today and I really want to message him but I don‚Äôt have any idea if he would want to speak to me again or if he‚Äôs over it and I should just make myself be over it to. I wouldn‚Äôt have any expectations for him or want a relationship, he just kind of feels special to me and I‚Äôd like to go back to our weird little dynamic we had going on. Should I reach out?
