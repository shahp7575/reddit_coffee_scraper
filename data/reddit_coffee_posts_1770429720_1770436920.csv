1qy3kl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1qy3kl7/what_if_im_mildly_autistic_and_coffee_is/,What if i'm mildly autistic and coffee is supressing some (positive?) aspects of it? i.e. focus.,"In a way? So like, I remember just really hyperfocusing almost on what was probably basic algebra when i was younger... ""not old enough to drink coffee"". I noticed coffee makes it harder to focus and I have cut back, used to think only a cup or two a day was fine but apparently not. So I've quit to improve my focus.

Well I just feel like everything clicks so much better now? (Mathwise) so what if i have the potentially to have some weird borderline being really good at math but its like at the expense of bad at other things like sometimes i misread people alot or am too into my own head and forget social rules.

And maybe somehow coffee focuses my mind in that way at the expense of other things(currently extremely academically relevant). Also, post quitting coffee, my speech or at least writing pattern has shifted. I remember it being closer to this when I was younger.)

Really long speech as well. Mentally I feel like my body is more in a different place physicaly? Like I can feel the connection between it and everything around me physically and just feel the outline of my surroundings I suppose.

And calm, all is calm, but also alot of things just seem to come to me more easily in a way and I feel really calm at the same time. Not sure why, and im not sure why such a strong effect exists. Like it feels real and fake at once, not in some weird ""oh nothing is real"" but like ""am i actually sitting here or am i in fact observing everything from an outside point of view but just convinced I am in fact within this area whatever it is"".

maybe someone is percieving me as watching through them whilst I've previously percieved such a feeling. My vocabulary feels... longer? longer words. Oddly enough. Can;t quite test this out in my 2nd language due to possibly a lack of fluency? Everything just really flows writing wise too. I could, probably, fit in more words than reddit would allow if i had a set topic to write on and then research perhaps and then like keep reading.

I was typing elsewhere online earlier and the only word that really fit in a sentence was this really old word that i knew but couldn't really define. But it came to mind first and I attempted to use it, and it ended up being loosely an ok definition for the context but still. Where is my mind grabbing words from?

Or this is a really narcissistic scribble of a writing here and this actually genuinely sounds really weirdly self-accolading in some manner of fashion that is displeasing and I better fix myself up I suppose. Hope its not that but I can see it being that.

Anyone else feel like their mind is drastically altered after quitting coffee? I havent quit caffine persay and I have had a cup here or there but not alot and nowhere near daily lately.

Like it feels almost as if my thoughts are floating through my ears? And they're louder and movable and placed on my tounge but they flow in motions out of my mind and into the sensory world.",1,1770436763.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

The extent of it that my partner noticed was that I would get a little more clingy or 'lovey', as he put it. I'm 21 and the last two months I've been a lot more emotional than I've ever been during menstruation. I've been a lot more depressed, sensitive, and anxious.

just yesterday, I had a very emotional response, though my partner said I was justified in it. Some a-hole looked at us while we were crossing a parking lot to finish our walk home and started doing donuts and revving his engine at the end of the lot. It was loud but the main thing that scared me was that it was dark and I saw out of the corner of my eye as he started to turn to do the donuts. To me, it looked like he was going to turn around and speed towards us. I acted on reflex. I screamed at my partner, ""Get out of the road!"" And I shoved him hard to the other side of the lot so that he was no longer walking in the center. As I said, it was an emotional response. Luckily my partner didn't fall or hurt himself and he assured me that he was okay and that the driver was just being a dick and doing donuts but wasn't going to actually do anything that could actually harm us.

After that, I couldn't help myself. I cried. Because while everything turned out to be fine, the fear I felt was real. I couldn't stop thinking about what if I was right and the driver had actually turned around to run us down? Logically, I know he wouldn't because we'd sue him to the high heavens, but emotionally, I'm still a little shaken up by the fact that my partner could have gotten hurt and my reflexes may not be enough to save him in an actual emergency.

Anyway, I haven't eaten yet today except for a cup of coffee with whipped cream and a marrichino (spelling?) cherry, courtesy of my partner, so give me ideas for your comfort snacks/meals. Preferably something low effort. I don't know what I want to eat.",1,1770436507.0,Periods,0,1.0,False
1qy3gwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketStationStories/comments/1qy3gwi/my_thoughts_as_an_ex_rocketeer/,My thoughts as an ex Rocketeer,"Worked here for 3 years. I left over a year ago, bago pa ung first lay off. When I joined maganda naman yung culture. OKay yung environment or maybe I have poor standards sa work place kasi it’s my first remote job and all other jobs I had were toxic. Naenjoy ko talaga experience ko. I stayed because of my teammates and yung SOM ko. By the way I was a part of the operations team. 

Pero despite that, marami talaga din akong nanotice or naexperience na sketchy tactics ng RS especially sa department namin. 

Hindi ako magaling magkwento lol so bear with me.

1. Nashare ko na to dun sa thread na isa sa AntiWork pero yung GPTW reviews are rigged. I remember noon, part ng scorecard namin yung pagsagot don. It had to be positive. No offense sa mga SOMs dati, I know directive lang din ng nasa itaas but binantayan talaga kami to complete it. Same sa mga social media reviews. May event noon sa Davao, you have to post reviews sa Glassdoor and Facebook para makakuha ng merch. 

2. Yung deliverables namin as OMs manageable naman pero sobrang daming manual input. Hindi ko alam bakit walang CRM when I started pero ung latter part ng employment ko sakanila nag transition kami to Hubspot.

3. Yung Google reviews ay part ng metrics namin as OMs. Required kami ipitch sa clients yon. Kapag may google review si client, the VA will get incentivized din. Pero ranking system pa un lol. Kahit 5 ang scorecard mo across KPIs pero kung di ka part ng top tier wala din. Pat on the back nalang talaga.

4. They have amazing leaders but fuck were we extremely undercompensated. I’ve learned a lot from my SOM before. Sobrang galing. Di ko na babanggitin kung sino kasi that will give away my identity pero ang dami kong nakatrabaho na magagaling. (Codenames nalang ng last names nila: W Conscience, A Sangkap, R Hoolur, J Lo, etc) I am unsure pano sila nagtagal kasi nung OM ako sobrang baba ng pay. Ang oa kasi below market standard. Triple ng pay ko noon ung pay ko ngayon. 

5. Bago ako umalis nagprice increase sa clients. Noon part time is $11/hr tapos full time VAs naman $10/hr. Pero never nagtaas ang base rate ng VAs. Starting rate nila is 3.75 I believe. Limot ko na. Then nagdagdag ng $1. Ang hirap nito kasi para mong dinadaya yung mga VA. Last I heard nagtaas pa uli pag alis ko kaya some clients umalis din. 

6. Totoo ung mga chika kay N. HOO sya nun. May paluwagan talaga sya tapos ang taas ng admin fee. Sabi ng friend ko para kang nag lagay ng interest sa sarili mong pera. I didn’t have much interactions with her. I am actually unsure what she does bukod sa magpabebe sa events kasi never naman syang nagmediate sa mga escalations. Sa end namin, it’s usually the SOMs lang talaga. 

7. VAs are told by the Placements team na medyo dayain yung resume nila to fit client’s requirements. Bago sumabak sa interview, pinapaedit sakanila yun to add yung relevant skill. Ang ending replacement. Kasi the client would notice na di alam ni VA ginagawa nya. I had to escalate yung department nila dati kasi ilang beses akong binigyan ng VA na wala experience or skill na kailangan ng client ko. 

8. Madaming magaling na SOMs pero ang dami ring kupal. Lol. M Ignatius and C Majong hello sainyo!!! Powertripper na mga wala sa lugar. Feeling magagaling. Si Mahjong may issue pa yan na kumabit sa VA dati nalaman ng asawa. Tapos kung makapag maldita leche ka ang baho ng hininga mo! Lagi yan may mga alipores na OMs na sunodsunuran sakanya. Magkakaugali sila nung mga OMs nyang di rin naman magagaling.

9. Crazy H - all talk walang galaw. Bad grammar and sentence construction. May issue to sa Davao na muntik makipagsabunutan sa isang part ngdepartment nya. Sobrang squammy ng bibig nito you couldnt tell kasi ang amo ng mukha. R Hombre I used to really like you pero parehas na parehas kayo ni N. Mga display sa kumpanya. Walang actual na trabaho. Yung coffee business pa laging kasama sa caterers for meet and greets di naman masarap!!

Madami pa to kaso inaantok na ko. Overall, lahat ng sinabi ng ibang tao tungkol sa RS in terms of nepotism and politics totoo yan. They just mask it with words, merch and events para kunwari they care about you. It’s all business at the end of the day.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1qy3f7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/1qy3f7w/coffee_shop_kevin_part_1/,Coffee Shop Kevin: Part 1,"(Are flairs added after posting? I've never posted here before. Edit: it seems they are. Cool.)

This will probably be a series because even though Kevin didn't work here for long, he gave me a lot of material. This is also mostly an intro post, and the background explanation is kind of long. I tend to not know when I should cut out information since I think everything is necessary. This post was a lot longer before I cut it down. Please let me know if it's too much and I'll try to make it shorter for next time, but it'll definitely be shorter because there wouldn't be exposition.


TLDR: Being a barista is complicated and stressful at first. I do my best to be understanding, but the Kevinness of Kevin and the stress of the holidays really tested my patience. Scroll down to the bold if you want to skip the explanation.


I am 20, and I work at the green siren-themed american coffee chain. Most of my coworkers are fantastic and i get along with them very well. They're what make working at this job bearable since i never have to think 'man i hope i don't have to work with so and so today.' Kevin was the exception. If i was having a good day, i'd be more tolerant and was interested to see what shenanigans he would pull. If i was having a bad day he would just make me upset. 


At the time, turnover was very high and my manager was hiring anyone with a pulse since the holidays, the busiest time of the year, were upon us. I think that's how Kevin slipped through the cracks.


Our drinks are so expensive (partly) because everything is handmade, we don't just press a button and the selected drink is dispensed like a soda machine at AMC. (That's why we don't like making frappuccinos, they take a long time and there are a lot of steps) Even though we have ipads that you can use to look up recipes, remembering them is difficult for new baristas, and it takes 1-3 months to really get comfortable on bar, especially when you throw in sequencing, which is when you're working on multiple drinks at once. It isn't possible for every drink, but it's an important skill to learn. More importantly, I don't expect speed from my trainees, I prioritize accuracy. We provide some cheat sheets for the number of shots/syrups, and I will never get annoyed with someone for asking me a question they've asked before. I've been in the position where you can't remember how many pumps of syrup go in a shaken espresso and you're worried your trainer will be mad at you for forgetting again. It's always better to just ask instead of guessing, being wrong, and then having to start over because the customer wants a remake. Measure twice, cut once. So I tried to be understanding towards Kevin, since I remember being new and nervous. Kevin wasn't nervous, as I would later learn. He wasn't nervous enough.


All that stuff about accuracy>speed, quality, and sequencing kind of goes out the window, because Kevin was a special case. I don't think he was autistic or mentally disabled. I'm autistic and he didn't really give off that vibe. I think he was just narcissistic and full of himself. We were once discussing autism and other neurodivergencies during a slow period (a higher than usual proportion of us are neurodivergent) and he said he had ADHD but nothing else, i don't think he was lying.


**The Kevining begins here**


I don't know much about Kevin because he didn't last very long. People like him never do. When I say 'people like him,' I mean people who can't take criticism and believe they're amazing, even when they're not.


If Kevin was just stupid, he would be bearable, but he believed he was God's gift to the Siren. In his eyes, he was the best and no one else could compare. We were all doing it wrong and we needed to conform to his idea of what should be the standard. He sucked at the job, but was an insane perfectionist, which is never a good combo. No matter how many times we coached him (corporate speak for correcting someone) or told him to pick up the pace, it wouldn't stick.


Easily the most annoying thing about Kevin was that he had zero sense of urgency. In a fast paced, high stress retail job, you have to know when to prioritize speed over perfection, and it's your job to make the call of when it's okay to cut a few corners. When you're new, it's best to just follow everything to the letter so you don't build bad habits. As you get used to the role, it's okay to do something like shaking a shaken espresso 9-11 times instead of the standard 10. As long as you aren't seriously fucking up and being lazy, (for example, using a different milk than what's on the ticket and hoping the customer won't notice is a big no due to dietary restrictions and potential allergies) it's okay to cheat a little or make mistakes. I say that, but Kevin was way too much of a stickler for the rules, in all the wrong ways.


Kevin was sloooooooow. Not mentally (i think) but in terms of speed. I don't expect new people to be as fast as someone thats been working here a long time, but after a point it gets excessive. The average time to make a (hot) latte, a very easy drink, literally just espresso shots and milk, is 30-45 seconds if the espresso machine isn't acting up. With correct sequencing, most competent baristas can make 2-3 of these types of drinks a minute. I timed Kevin once. He took 2 full minutes to make one latte. This is absolutely ludicrous. My latest trainee (capable kid, pretty average) was making a latte in ~50 seconds once he got the hang of the basics around day 2 of learning hot bar. Steaming milk is a pretty easy process once you get the hang of it. To get the perfect microfoam for a latte, you put the steam wand in the pitcher of milk, slide it out until it makes a paper tearing sound for a few seconds depending on the drink, then leave it for about 20 seconds until it's done. There will be some bubbles in the foam, but tapping the pitcher of milk 2 or 3 times and swirling it a bit usually fixes it. It does NOT need to be perfect, it's fine if you can't get all of them. The customer isn't going to care, they want to get their drink so they can go to work. Kevin didn't understand this. I once timed him tapping and swirling ONE pitcher of milk, it took him, not exaggerating, over 40 seconds of just tapping and swirling until he deemed it acceptable. It was not acceptable. I couldn't watch the excruciating tapping and swirling and had to step in.


'Kevin, it's fine, you can stop.'

'But there are still bubbles!' 

'The customer isn't gonna be taking the lid off to check for bubbles, it's fine, just pour and cap it!'

The CUSTOMER chimes in and says 'Yeah, its fine, I'm going to be late, I need to go!'

Kevin *finally* pours and caps the latte and I hand it off while whispering 'sorry' to the customer.

'Dude, the guy really needed to leave. You need to speed it up a little.'

'Quality over quantity.'


Kevin's favorite thing to say whenever anyone confronted him about his speed was 'quality over quantity.' In his eyes, every drink needed to be absolutely perfect, no matter how badly the queue got backed up. 


We typically have 2 hot bar stations, one for cafe and one for mobile orders. If one person doesn't have a lot of tickets and the other is drowning, the first person will take tickets and work on them to take the heat off them. When Kevin was on hot bar, the other person knew they would have to pick up all the slack because while Kevin was, for example, POURING OUT THE PERFECTLY FINE SHAKEN ESPRESSO HE JUST MADE AND STARTING OVER because he shook it 11 times instead of 10 (i am not joking i saw him do this once and was shocked) the other person would be taking his tickets and pumping out drinks under a rapidly increasing queue while our manager is complaining about queue times. Kevin was always oblivious to this. The only thing he saw was what drink he was 'perfecting' right then, everything else be damned. He once got upset when the other person took his tickets because he thought they were implying he couldn't do the job. He couldn't, but when someone does that, they're being nice and trying to help, not slighting you.


He couldn't be trusted with the register. Not because he stole money or couldn't make change correctly or anything, but because he was so, so slow. This company loooooves customer connection, which is fine when it's not too busy, but during a rush I always pick up the pace. My 'script' is usually along the lines of 'Hi, hows it going?' Hot or iced? What size? Anything else? Your name for the order? Great, that'll be $___, cash, card, or the app? It'll be down at the end of the bar, thanks!' With this script and a bit of editing depending on the situation, I can get through 1 customer in about 20-30 seconds at most during a rush. Even shorter if they know their exact order or they're a regular and I already know what they want. When it's slow, then i'll try to make customer connections by complimenting something about them or trying to make conversation. There's a time and place for making connections. 8 am on a weekday is NOT that time. Kevin did not understand this. To him, the only customer that mattered was the one he was talking to right then. Everyone else may as well not exist. I remember one specific moment very clearly because of the sheer audacity. I was on cafe hot bar making drinks, this is right next to the register. Kevin was on register by himself, talking with an older woman. While my script was condensed and made for getting people through during a rush, Kevin would talk like he was getting paid by the word. (I think i write like that too, sorry) I started committing this conversation to memory once I realized what was going on. Keep in mind there was a line building.


(Paraphrasing a bit but not exaggerating at all)

'Can I get a tall americano please?'

'Sure, would you like to try our blonde roast as well?' 

'No, sweetie, I'd just like a hot americano.'

'Would you like to try our darker roasts instead? Or blonde shots for your americano?'

'No, just the one drink, please.'

'Would you like any food with that?'

'No thank you, I'll pay with cash now if you don't mind.'

'Would you like cold foam with your drink?' (Cold foam on a hot americano is insane fyi, our manager loves it when we upsell cold foam because it's a money maker but it's not for every drink. I think he took her words to heart)

'No? Just the americano. How much is it?' *She starts pulling out her wallet*

'$___, would you like to pay with our rewards app?' (Kevin loved pitching the rewards app to everyone)

'No, I just want to pay with cash.'

'Do you want to sign up for the rewards app?'

I don't remember the rest because I got fed up. The line was almost out the door and people were getting upset. I flagged down the person on customer support (they actually support baristas by keeping us stocked and flexing positions where they're needed, its a misleading name) to have her cover for me while I hopped on the other register to take care of the line. I shortened the script to just the necessary bits and luckily the customers cooperated since they wanted to get out of there and had had *plenty* of time to decide what they wanted before they got to the register.


'Can I just get a grande iced coffee?'
'Sure, that's $___. Name?' 'John.' *they pull out their card* 'Card? Card. Thanks, next!'

By the time I got through about 10 customers, Kevin was *still* talking to the old lady who was really getting annoyed, and she seemed like the sweet grandma type who loved to talk. Eventually he let her go, but no customer went to his register since they didn't want to get caught in an unskippable cutscene. I don't blame them.
Finally we were done, I swapped back with customer support, and the shift lead Jacob (who was on ovens, register/ovens is usually done by one person if there isn't a rush, but Kevin couldn't multitask) laid into him.


Jacob, 19, is a shift lead who's been working here 6 months longer than me. He hasn't been a shift for long so he's nervous about being in a leadership position. He's cool and also my friend. He's very chill so this was out of character for him and he was really getting tired of Kevin.


'Enough of the long conversations, she wanted to leave, you should have wrapped it up ages ago!'

'Quality over quantity, we're supposed to be making connections with customers!' 

'Yes, but this is excessive. You need to be faster, stop asking people if they want to try the roasts, stop suggesting modifications or other drinks unless they ask you, and stop asking people if they want the app! Enough! Please!'

'But I was making connections!'

'With one person! OP had to stop what he was doing and take care of the entire line by himself because of you! Sara (customer support) was restocking milk for Austin (mobile bar) when OP needed her to cover so he could cover for *you,* so Austin had to get it himself, which lead to his queue getting high, so now OP and Austin have to get their queue down, the mobile times will be higher, people are more likely to be upset about the wait, all because you don't know when to stop! When you do this, it causes a chain reaction that affects the whole store. Sure, one person is happy, but everyone else is pissed off at you!'

'Okay, okay, I get it.' Kevin did not, in fact, get it.


I hope I got across how the 'team' needs to work together and be a well oiled machine. Working here is very chaotic and busy, and isn't for everyone. Our store works very well together and that's why we do well. Regulars go out of their way to come to our store because they like us and we do a good job. That's why Kevin was shaking us all up, because we weren't used to this type of incompetence.

Just left Hué, one of my favorite cities in Viet Nam. Pandan, incense, coffee (so much coffee🤎), grilled lemongrass meats, frangipani and a smidge of exhaust, mustiness (high humidity and annual floods), cigarettes and solvent are in the air. 

I was thrilled to find some pandan and pomelo essential oils here that I will blend into a room spray back home. I wonder if anyone knows about a candle capturing a scent like this, or at the very least, one with strong notes of pandan? To my nose, it's an intoxicating nutty toasted rice, sesame, vanilla and grass blend. There are a few candles online with pandan notes but it would be great to hear from someone who has personal experience with with a candle like this.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

On top of everything, Oromo is one out of a few remaining Vegan/Vegetarian places within the BuckTown vicinity. I really think this community can help. It doesn’t take much, maybe just grab a coffee.

1qy3b3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIronCouncil/comments/1qy3b3x/how_to_be_the_fun_person_in_the_room_without/,How to Be the FUN Person in the Room Without Trying Too Hard: The Psychology That Actually Works,"You walk into a room, and there's always that one person everyone gravitates toward. They're not the loudest. Not the funniest joke-teller. But somehow, people just want to be around them. Meanwhile, you're standing there like a cardboard cutout, wondering what the hell you're missing.

Here's what I've learned after diving deep into social psychology research, behavioural science podcasts, and books by actual experts (not some guru bullshit). Being ""fun"" isn't about performing or faking energy. It's about presence, genuine curiosity, and understanding how human connection actually works. I used to think I needed to be ""on"" all the time, cracking jokes, being the entertainer. Turns out, that's exhausting and fake as hell. So I dug into what actually makes people magnetic.

Step 1: Stop Performing, Start Connecting

The biggest trap? Thinking you need to entertain people. You're not a circus monkey. Fun people don't perform; they engage. They make others feel seen and heard, which creates that warm, magnetic vibe.

Ditch the script. Stop planning what clever thing you'll say next while someone's talking. Actually listen. Ask follow-up questions that show you're genuinely curious. ""Wait, how did that make you feel?"" or ""What happened next?"" sounds simple, but most people are so stuck in their own heads that they never do this.

Research from MIT's Human Dynamics Lab shows that conversational turn-taking and responsiveness are the strongest predictors of whether people enjoy an interaction. Translation: It's not about being the star, it's about making the conversation flow.

Step 2: Master the Art of Playful Energy

Fun people have this lightness about them. They don't take everything so seriously. They tease (gently), make observations that are a bit absurd, and aren't afraid to look silly.

Practical move: Start noticing funny, weird details around you and point them out. ""Is it just me, or does this elevator music sound like a villain's theme song?"" Small, playful observations break the ice and signal you're not uptight.

Dr Stuart Brown's research on play (he literally founded the National Institute for Play) shows that playfulness isn't childish; it's essential for adult bonding and creativity. His book The Power of Play is an insanely good read that'll make you rethink how seriously you take life. Brown studied thousands of people and found that those who maintain playfulness have better relationships, less stress, and more resilience. This book will make you question everything you think you know about ""acting your age.""

Step 3: Bring Good Vibes, Not Negative Energy

Nobody wants to be around someone who constantly complains, gossips, or dumps their problems. You don't have to be fake positive, but there's a difference between being real and being a black hole of negativity.

Check yourself: Are you the person who always finds what's wrong? The food sucks, the music's too loud, someone's outfit is weird? Cut that shit out. Instead, find something genuinely cool or interesting and mention it.

Psychologist Barbara Fredrickson's research on positive emotions (check out her work, she's at UNC Chapel Hill) shows that positivity is contagious. When you bring light, curious, open energy, people literally feel better around you. It's biology.

Step 4: Tell Better Stories (Not Longer Ones)

Fun people are often good storytellers, but here's the twist: their stories are short, vivid, and have a point. They're not rambling for ten minutes about something that happened at work.

The formula: Set the scene quickly (where, when), hit the conflict or weird moment, land the punchline or insight, done. 90 seconds max for most stories.

Example: Instead of ""So yesterday I was at the coffee shop, and there was this long line, and I was tired because I didn't sleep well..."" just say ""I watched a guy at Starbucks order a drink so complicated the barista had to write it on two cups. Absolute chaos.""

Matthew Dicks is a storytelling master. His book Storyworthy teaches you how to find and tell stories that actually land. Dicks has won The Moth storytelling competition like 50 times, so he knows what he's talking about. The book is packed with practical techniques that make your everyday life sound way more interesting. Best storytelling book I've ever read, hands down.

Step 5: Be Genuinely Curious About People

This is the secret sauce. Fun people ask interesting questions and actually care about the answers. They don't interrogate, they explore.

Instead of ""What do you do?"" (boring, predictable), try ""What's been keeping you busy lately?"" or ""What's something you're excited about right now?""

The podcast [The Art of Charm](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-art-of-charm/id212382281) (specifically episodes with Jordan Harbinger) breaks down how to ask questions that open people up instead of shutting them down. Harbinger interviews FBI agents, psychologists, and social dynamics experts about what makes conversations flow. It's gold.

Bonus move: Remember small details people tell you and bring them up later. ""Hey, didn't you say you were learning guitar? How's that going?"" People feel valued when you remember their stuff.

Step 6: Learn to Vibe-Match (But Don't Be a Chameleon)

Fun people adjust their energy to the room without losing themselves. If it's a chill hangout, they're relaxed. If it's high energy, they match it. But they don't fake an entirely different personality.

The key: Read the room's energy level and meet it about 80% of the way while staying authentic. If everyone's laughing and loud, don't be the serious, quiet person in the corner. But also don't force yourself to be someone you're not.

Social psychologist Vanessa Van Edwards (she runs Science of People) has great research on nonverbal cues and matching energy. Her book Captivate teaches you how to read social situations and adjust without being fake. Van Edwards studied thousands of hours of social interactions and breaks down exactly what makes people charismatic. This book will make your social awareness skyrocket.

If the books above resonate but you want a more personalised way to internalise this stuff without the reading grind, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) might be worth checking out. It's an AI learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that pulls from books like Captivate, The Power of Play, and tons of social psychology research to create custom audio podcasts based on your specific goals.

You can tell it something like ""I'm an introvert who wants to be more fun and magnetic in social settings"", and it'll generate a structured learning plan with episodes you can listen to during your commute. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. Plus, there's a virtual coach you can chat with about your specific struggles. The voice options are surprisingly addictive; there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes learning way less boring.

Step 7: Stop Seeking Approval

Here's the paradox: The more you try to be liked, the less likeable you become. Fun people don't desperately seek validation. They're comfortable with themselves, which makes others comfortable too.

Reality check: Not everyone will vibe with you. That's fine. Trying to please everyone makes you bland and exhausted. Be polarising. Have opinions. Say what you actually think (without being an asshole).

When you stop performing for approval, you relax. And relaxed energy is attractive energy.

Step 8: Use Humour, But Don't Force It

You don't need to be a comedian. Light, observational humour works better than trying to land big jokes. Make fun of situations, not people (unless it's gentle teasing with someone you know well).

Easy wins:

* Self-deprecating humour (not self-hatred, just acknowledging your own absurdity)
* Pointing out funny contrasts or irony
* Playful exaggeration

Avoid: Mean jokes, controversial topics with new people, or trying too hard with rehearsed bits.

Step 9: Show Up Consistently and Authentically

Fun people aren't fun because they have one great night. They're consistent. They show up, engage, and build genuine connections over time.

The app [Ash](https://apps.apple.com/ai/app/ash-ai-for-mental-health/id6474862947) is weirdly helpful here. It's a mental health and relationship coach app that gives you daily prompts to check in with yourself. Sounds basic, but it helps you stay grounded and authentic, which is key to showing up as your real self instead of some anxious, performing version.

Step 10: Give a Damn About Other People's Joy

This is the ultimate move. Fun people genuinely want others to have a good time. They introduce people who should meet. They hype up their friends' wins. They bring snacks, suggest cool activities, and remember birthdays.

Simple shift: Stop asking ""What's in it for me?"" and start asking ""How can I make this more fun for everyone?""

When you focus on creating positive experiences for others, you become someone people want around. It's not manipulation, it's generosity.

Being the fun person isn't about being loud, or funny, or the centre of attention. It's about being present, curious, playful, and genuinely invested in connection. The world makes you think you need to perform, but real magnetism comes from being comfortable in your own skin and making others feel good around you. You don't need to be someone else. You just need to show up as the best, most engaged version of yourself.",1,1770435990.0,TheIronCouncil,0,1.0,False

1qy3a98,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1qy3a98/aio_about_my_bfs_underwhelming_present/,AIO about my bf’s underwhelming present?,"I (26F) posted to AITA in June about my boyfriend’s (33M) birthday. Long story short: I’m a broke grad student. So, for my bf’s birthday I cooked him three special meals, deep cleaned his house, made him a card, curated his favorites for a movie night, and organized a surprise party. He was upset I didn’t get him a physical gift to open even though my budget is very tight because of school (server job keeps me afloat while I take classes and work an unpaid fellowship).

So, my birthday was last week. When we first got together, we had only been dating for a couple months and were not very serious, so we just had dinner to celebrate. This year, though, when he asked me what I wanted for my birthday, I told him I wanted an experience.

I’m not that into gifts, especially if they’re not something useful. If I’m going to spend money on something, I want to  get a lot of use out of it to justify the expense. I like memories and new experiences more anyway. I basically told him to pretend like it was our first date and he was trying to impress me. When he asked me what I meant, I gave him some suggestions (a cool coffee shot or ice cream place that was far enough away to require a mini roadtrip with curated playlists, trivia night at a weird themed bar with cool drinks, a museum crawl with funky exhibits, I basically gave him a map). He said okay and I started to get excited about what he might plan.

Well, when my birthday came around he didn’t tell me about any plans. It was during the week, and I wasn’t expecting him to take the day off work, but I thought maybe he had a day set aside during that weekend or next. I was wrong. I went to his place after he got home from work and he kissed me, gave me flowers and a box, and said happy birthday. The box had a necklace in it, very pretty, but very not my thing unfortunately. Plus it was silver. I don’t wear silver jewelry. I wear gold jewelry.

I guess he noticed my disappointment because he asked what was wrong. I told him the necklace and flowers were beautiful, but not what I was expecting. He replied that the necklace was expensive and he put a lot of thought into choosing it. I asked him why he would explicitly ask me what I wanted for my birthday if he wasn’t going to listen. Then he said “It sucks to be blindsided and disappointed on your birthday, huh?”

That hurt a lot. We’re in very different financial situations. I’m a student with an unpaid internship. He’s settled in his career with disposable income. And when I asked what he wanted for his birthday, he said he would love whatever I ended up getting him, even if it was tiny, so I had nothing to go on.

It feels like he asked me what I wanted so he could do something completely different and make me feel bad because I accidentally made him feel bad on his birthday. Does that sound off the mark? Am I being hypocritical because of how he felt on his birthday? Am I overreacting about my birthday?",14,1770435921.0,AmIOverreacting,31,0.85,False

My girlfriend and I are heading to Costa Rica April 19–26 FOR OUR FIRST TIME and I wanted to sanity-check our plans and get some recommendations from people who’ve done similar routes.

Itinerary:

	•	Fly into SJO

	•	4 nights La Fortuna

	•	First 2 nights in an Airbnb just north of La Fortuna (very jungle/scenic, hot tub vibes)

	•	Next 2 nights in an Airbnb right in town with a view of Arenal

	•	Last 3 nights in an Airbnb in Quepos / Manuel Antonio area

	•	Flying out of SJO Sunday around 1:30pm

We’re planning to rent a car (likely Adobe or Alamo, possibly a private renter). We’re totally fine with early starts and aren’t afraid of driving—happy to leave at like 6am if it makes the day smoother.

Things that looked cool:

	•	National parks & hiking

	•	Hot springs / waterfalls

	•	Coffee & chocolate tours

	•	Wildlife (sloths, monkeys, birds, etc.)

	•	We love Eating our way through towns (casual local food + must-try spots)

Main questions:

	1.	Drive from La Fortuna → Quepos

I’ve heard \~5 hours depending on route and conditions. Any preferred routes or tips? Is it worth stopping anywhere along the way or better to just power through early?

	2.	Must-do recommendations

	•	Favorite hikes / parks around Arenal

	•	Best coffee or chocolate tours that feel authentic (not super tourist-trappy)

	•	Can’t-miss food spots in La Fortuna or Quepos / Manuel Antonio

	•	Anything underrated or unexpectedly awesome

	3.	Departure day

Since our flight is mid-day Sunday, is staying in Quepos the night before reasonable, or would you recommend repositioning closer to SJO Saturday night?",1,1770435888.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False
1qy39fd,https://i.redd.it/0bxtagjjuzhg1.jpeg,Como encontrar alguém em um mundo cada vez mais digital,"Vivemos conectados o tempo todo.

Conversamos por mensagens, trabalhamos online, fazemos compras pelo celular e até buscamos amor por aplicativos.

Mesmo assim, muita gente sente que **encontrar alguém está cada vez mais difícil**.

Isso acontece porque a tecnologia tem dois lados:

1. Ela aproxima pessoas que nunca se encontrariam.
2. Mas também pode afastar quando tudo vira pressa, comparação e descartabilidade.

Neste Valentine’s Day, comemorado nos Estados Unidos no próximo dia 14 de fevereiro, vale olhar para os aplicativos de relacionamento com outro foco  
**o do bem estar emocional e da intenção real**.

# A tecnologia afasta e aproxima ao mesmo tempo

# A tecnologia afasta quando:

* Tudo vira swipe
* As conversas são rasas
* As pessoas parecem substituíveis

# Mas ela aproxima quando:

* Existe curiosidade genuína
* As conversas têm espaço para silêncio e escuta
* As escolhas são feitas com mais consciência

O problema não está na tecnologia. Está em como usamos ela.

# Dois tipos de apps para dois momentos diferentes da vida

Nem todo mundo busca a mesma coisa e **tudo bem**.

Por isso, os aplicativos podem ser vistos em **duas grandes categorias**, dependendo do seu momento emocional.

# Para algo mais casual 😏

Leve, espontâneo e sem tanta pressão.

Esses apps funcionam bem quando a ideia é conhecer pessoas novas, sair da rotina e deixar as coisas acontecerem naturalmente.

Eles são rápidos, intuitivos e conectam pessoas próximas.

Alguns exemplos:

* [Tinder](https://tinder.com/pt/download/)
* [Bumble](https://bumble.com/pt/)
* [Happn](https://www.happn.com/pt/)

Aqui, o bem estar está em **não criar expectativas excessivas**.  
Ser claro, gentil e respeitoso já faz toda a diferença.

# Para conexões mais profundas ❤️

Quando conversar importa tanto quanto encontrar.

Se você sente falta de diálogos reais, valores em comum e trocas mais humanas, esses aplicativos podem fazer mais sentido.

Eles usam tecnologia para criar compatibilidade além da aparência.

Alguns exemplos:

* [Hinge](https://hinge.co/pt-br)
* [OkCupid](https://www.okcupid.com/)
* [Boo](https://boo.world/pt)
* [Coffee Meets Bagel](https://ww.coffeemeetsbagel.com/)

Esses apps incentivam perfis mais completos, perguntas reflexivas e conversas que fluem com mais intenção.

Aqui, a tecnologia vira aliada do bem estar emocional.

# Como iniciar conversas mais profundas

E criar conexão de verdade.

Você não precisa de frases prontas. Precisa de presença.

Trocar mensagens pode ser um convite ao cuidado, não à performance.

Algumas ideias simples para começar:

>

>

>

>

Essas perguntas mostram interesse real.  
E quando alguém se sente visto, a conexão cresce.

# Bem estar também é segurança

Cuidados importantes ao marcar um encontro

Criar vínculos é bonito.  
Se cuidar também é.

Algumas práticas essenciais:

* Prefira sempre locais públicos 🏖️🍟🖼️
* Avise amigos ou familiares sobre o encontro👪👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👩‍👦👩‍👧‍👦
* Compartilhe sua localização em tempo real📍
* Tenha um contato de emergência configurado no celular 📲🆘
* Confie no seu instinto: Se algo não parecer certo, respeite isso 🏃‍➡️

Sentir segurança é parte fundamental de qualquer relação saudável.

# No fim das contas

A tecnologia não substitui o encontro, mas pode ser o começo.

Ela não cria o sentimento. mas pode abrir o espaço.

Quando usada com **intenção**, **empatia** e **cuidado**, a tecnologia pode apoiar o bem estar emocional e aproximar pessoas de forma mais humana.

Talvez para algo leve.

They might send a flood of people here to discredit me by calling me crazy or poking holes in my logic. The herd mentality is very real so they will manufacture a herd to come here and discredit me, so you follow the herd they created. They will also downvote my post and comments while upvoting all of their own comments to give the illusion that no one believes me. They will attack your character, your sanity, or your credibility then point the finger at you and call you a bad guy for responding. This is textbook narcissism. Then they will report you for responding to their attacks to get you banned. Just be aware, when you see this in the comments, it is either a bot or someone sent by them to make sure no one believes what you say.

Here is some proof that hey send people to discredit you by calling you crazy and acting like they are not a mason. They did it on my previous post but then admitted it was them then threw a tantrum because I won't join them. They are doing the same thing here in this comment section

[Masonic Tantrum After I Exposed the Truth - Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/masonic-tantrum-after-i-exposed-truth-QOKvKS9)



Here is their secret

Study astrology, alchemy, witchcraft, voodoo, etc. The topics that they want you to believe are ridiculous. They are very real. They don't want you to study it because they don't want you to gain that much power and use it against them.  

The 12 apostles are based on the 12 zodiac signs. Jesus lived to be 33 years old, there are also 33 degrees in the Masonic Scottish Rite. There are 33 bones in your spine. The kundalini begins at the base of your spine when the moon passes through your zodiac sign each month.  

They intentionally threw off this cycle by making 12 months in a year rather than 13 months to match the 13 zodiac signs. The solar calendar does not match the lunar calendar on purpose. The 13th zodiac was erased from history. The Ophiuchus or the serpent bearer, like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent in the garden is debated to be Lucifer. Both Lucifer and Jesus are known as the morning star. Venus is also known as the morning star. 

Each day it ascends one bone as long as you refrain from the deadly sins. No sex, no wrath, no gluttony, that's why fasting is important. And also, why we as Americans are over fed and have a higher rate of obesity. Because they are trying to stuff our faces with food, so we don't accidentally open our third eye. Also, no acidic foods. It will destroy the kundalini. No coffee either. If it is a major addiction in the US then avoid it. No caffeine, no sugar, no nicotine, no drugs, and so on. The only exception is DMT, I know this is a psychedelic drug that they use in their rituals to assist in opening their third eye.  

Everything in the US is structured to make sure we never reach this state.  

Lust, Men are taught that the more women they have sex with the cooler they are. Women are taught that OnlyFans is empowering. Porn is also free and sex is in all media.  

Envy, we are taught to envy the rich. Their expensive homes, their fast cars, designer clothes, and exotic trips. 

Wrath, we are taught to hate each other for one reason or another whether it be for race, religion, sex, political beliefs, etc.  

Pride, we are taught to take pride in our nation to the point of ignorance and blind belief in authority. 

Gluttony, we are overfed as Americans which is why we have such a high rate of obesity. Our food is also tainted with ingredients that hinder our chances of reaching this state. Eat kosher foods, the tiny hats that are hiding this information would not do this to their own people.

Sloth, we are fed sites like Tik Tok and social media where we spend more time doom scrolling than we do exercising or attempting to build a better life for ourselves. 

Greed, we are taught to look out after ourselves only. We are made to believe in the scarcity mindset, where there aren't enough resources to go around so we keep more for ourselves and never share.  We take more than we need and even at the cost of others.

You must also feel authentic compassion towards others. The point is to open your heart. The saying ""Heart of gold"" did not come from nowhere. Scientists found that there are more pathways sending signals from the heart to the brain than from the brain to the heart. There is a reason the heart was considered the most important part of your body in ancient times. 

Once it makes it to the top of our spine into the pineal gland it stays there for a few days. Jesus was resurrected on the third day. On the third day it drops down back to the base of our spine and you are born again in new consciousness. 

Congratulations you are now a ""god"". You can manifest on command and even read minds of others. Your mind will exist on a higher plane than this 3 dimensional one so you can access other objects that are on that plane though unconsciously, including other people's minds and even invade their dreams. You will retain your memory after death because this body is temporary, but your mind has now accessed a higher plane of existence. You will be born in a new body after some time of void and darkness, but you will keep all the memories of your past life. You are now also immortal.  

I believe they may have possibly left some information out, but this is the truth that I know so far. You may have to wait until the full moon passes through your zodiac sign. You also might have to do the Wim Hoff miracle breathing technique regularly while meditating on your chakras. And they may have left out important information about Venus, but I am not sure.  ",3,1770435754.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

I had some issues with my water softener and it left buildup a lot of places and I know you can descale things like coffee machines (I knot because I did mine and a ton of buildup came out).

There was no queue and as usual, the parents were standing all over and the vendor did not manage it well. 

I asked if the way they are standing is the queue and the lady to my side was clueless. So I had to loudly call the vendor to get my attention, asked him to serve only for the ones coming in queue, and pushed the folks to form a queue. There were still some people not on the queue. 

I called one of them to come stand in the queue, he stood behind me and started passive aggressive conversation with me. “Why did you call only me?” “Why are you not calling them?” “If you call me, you should call everyone!” “If I was standing there, I would have already got my things”

I was actually dumbstruck. I asked why don’t you join me in calling people to form the queue. He raised his tone more saying why should he call adhu idhu nu. Then he went back out of the queue. What I did? I again called the vendor and asked him to not serve people coming out of the queue and he obliged, started insisting such people to go on the queue. When I got my things, I saw at least 20 people on the queue, vendor able to manage providing the items in a calm way and everyone‘s time respected.

Everyone I spoke to had no specific date or timeline for the process. Even when I asked the PI, they said they aren’t sure since they aren’t the only one involved in the decision process.

I was wondering when it would be appropriate to send a follow-up email for updates. Also, who should I email about updates? The interview was last Thursday and I sent a quick thank you email to the PI and the lab member who sped up the interview process.

Like many of you, I've been following Andrew Huberman's recommendations on light exposure and caffeine timing. But I kept forgetting the details or getting the timing wrong.

So I built an app called ARC that automates the whole thing:

**What it tracks:**

1. **Photon Latency** \- Reminds you to get sunlight within 20-30 mins of waking
2. **Caffeine Half-Life** \- Based on your metabolism, it calculates when to stop drinking coffee so it doesn't affect your sleep
3. **Circadian Blocks** \- Maps your entire day into energy phases (Peak Focus, Recovery, Wind-Down, etc.)

**How it works:**

* You take a 60-second ""Diagnosis"" that identifies your chronotype
* The app generates a personalized Daily Trajectory
* You check off ""missions"" as you complete them (sunlight, deep work, etc.)

It's been a game-changer for me. I'm no longer guessing when to drink coffee or when to schedule my hardest tasks.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

What Began as a Dare Has Become a Rescue Mission [Part 1 of 5],"Note: this is a long form stand alone novella with 5 parts. It is completed and self contained.

Patient 432 [part 1 of 5]

I sat in the day room of my unit at the Utah State Hospital, looking at the others going about their daily routines.  Contrary to popular belief, or at least the belief portrayed in movies, most of the people here were mostly normal.  There were a few who definitely looked crazy, and almost everyone talked to themselves, but I wouldn’t see any of them as crazy if I ran into them at 7-11 or something out there.  Back in the real world.

Normally, I would be over by the big window, looking out at the sun, maybe playing a board game with Jessica.  She was another older teen like me, brownish red hair, and fun to be around.  She even acted like she could be interested in me.  If we were out in the real world, there could be a shot at dating her.  I didn’t want to get too close, though, because allegedly I would be getting released soon.

I looked back out the window at the massive tree out in the grounds in front of my unit, soaking up the late September sun.  Elm?  Oak?  I didn’t know.  Today I was going to talk to my primary psychiatrist about being released.

Back to the real world.

“Tyler, there you are,” a calm woman said from behind me, startling me out of my thoughts.
I jerked, pulling my gaze from the tree outside to look at the woman.

She smiled, making no note about my sudden, jerky motion.  It was commonplace here.

“It’s time to go see Doctor Carrington,” the nurse said.  Or maybe she was an orderly.  I don’t really know what the difference is.

“With a name like Carrington, he has to be official!” I quipped in a commercial announcer voice.

The nurse smiled a little bigger.  “Let’s go, Mr. Ruiz.”

I got up from the thickly upholstered chair I had been sitting in.  I wouldn’t miss the weird pale green color of that thing, that was for sure.

The nurse led me down a couple of sterile hallways, past taped markings on the ground showing us where we weren’t allowed to walk without supervision.  Mostly, we passed other patient rooms, but there was the occasional office and one rather scary looking janitor’s office that always seemed to be open.

I swear, the tiny faucet and drain for the mop bucket was possessed and haunted, and had probably been imported from an Indian burial ground, or something.  As we walked past, a great gurgling sound belched out from the drain, making me flinch.  I hated that damn room.

The nurse, to no surprise, showed no reaction at all to the noise, and led me onward.

She deposited me in a smaller version of the day room.  This one lacked the fluorescent lights of the rest of the building, and had instead gone for sparse ‘normal’ lighting.  Incandescent, I think.  The idea was probably to make the area feel more like a living room and less like the sterile hospital that it was.

There was a group therapy session going on here, and one of the younger psychiatrists was leading.
“Hello, Mr. Tyler,” the psych said.  “Go ahead and have a seat while you’re waiting on Dr. Carrington.”

I noted that he had just been talking with one of the other patients.  Talking at one of the other patients, I should say.

The man was probably in his forties, or maybe late thirties, and I only knew him as Kells, which had to be his last name.  Other patients, orderlies, and nurses, they all just called him Kells.  The guy had a short brown beard that was starting to turn gray in small spots, and hair a couple of inches long that was always messy.  He had blue eyes that felt cold, as if they were actually made of ice.  I had never heard the guy’s voice, because he just… never talked.  There were many rumors about what illness he had been diagnosed with, but no one seemed to know for sure.

“Now, Mr. Martin,” the psych said, returning his attention to Kells.  Apparently Martin was his first name- this particular psych was famous for always saying ‘Mr.’ or ‘Miss’ in front of everyone’s first names.  “If you would just communicate your feelings, we would be able to make some progress, and perhaps some of your privileges would even be returned to you.  You know that if we never make progress, any hope of release is all but non-existent.”

There were six other people sitting on chairs and couches in the loose circle, a couple with foam cups of coffee or water, and none of them seemed exactly thrilled to be here.  Not that I could blame them.

“Ironic, isn’t it?” a voice spoke.  It was coarse, but soft.  Like a guy who had done a lot of smoking, but didn’t see the need to speak above a face to face conversation level.

Holy crap.  Kells had been the one speaking.  I actually got chills.  Entire scary stories had been spun just explaining his years-long silence in this place.

“You can’t even see the fallacy of your statement,” Kells continued in a voice that was calm right down to the level of a psychopathic killer toying with his little mouse of a victim.  “You deprive others of basic rights, refer to those rights as privileges so that you can justify taking them, and then refuse to allow us basic decency unless we prance about like puppets when you pull upon our delicate strings, all the while hoping that we can’t see those strings.  You don’t care about my feelings, and you are incapable of communication.  You instead demand parroting of your rhetoric, dangling the carrot of release and the prize of being given access to uninhibited sunshine and outside air for successfully fitting into your little program.  You don’t care about my feelings, and you don’t want to hear about them, you want me to assure you of your own superiority and my adherence to your script.”

I suspected that Kells was going to continue further, but when he paused for an inhale, the psychiatrist jumped in.

“Now, now, Mr. Martin, those things aren’t true,” the psych managed, with only a little strain in his voice.  “Psychiatrists are here to help, and we do want to know your story so that we can understand you.”

“I wasn’t speaking about psychiatrists,” Kells snapped, still not raising his voice, but speaking quicker and with more force.  “I was speaking about you.  Most psychiatrists got into their work because they truly wanted to help others.  I would imagine that most of them still do want to help.  I am pointing out the flaws in your thinking- you want me to say the things that you want me to say, and you even overtly threatened to deny me freedom permanently until I decide to play your little game.”

“I did no such thing,” the psych said, stammering now.

“You did.  You told me that while I refused to communicate my feelings, any hope of release is essentially non-existent.  But you don’t want my feelings or my communication, because communication is two-way, and any real transfer of meaningful information involves a close look at not just myself, but at you, and the last thing you want, my friend,” Kells practically snarled the word friend, showing most of his teeth, “is for me to give you information about yourself.”

“I don’t have anything to hide,” the psych managed.  Sweat actually broke out on his forehead.  The other six people here were squirming in their seats, but most looked like they were trying hard to stifle a smile.

I could totally relate to that.  Sure, I agreed that most psychs probably wanted to help people, but in this place… I hadn’t seen any real help yet.  It probably existed.  People did get released from this hospital on a semi-regular basis, it wasn’t an island of no hope.  But this guy, and most of the psychs that I had dealt with… I think Kells had a point.  A damn good one.

“You have everything to hide,” Kells snapped.  His voice rose ever so slightly in volume, but he was far from shouting.  “The real tragedy here isn’t me, nor is it your ineptitude,” Kells continued.  “It is the fact that you are training these people, who have been deemed by the State of Utah as being emotionally and mentally in need of help, to better wear a mask.  You aren’t seeking truth, you aren’t seeking treatment, you are simply training these people that if they can manage to adjust their mask the right way, and recite the right lines, they might win that part on the great stage of life.  They might be rewarded with freedom and release.”

“This isn’t helping,” the psych stammered.  Now he was squirming even worse than the others.

“Of course it isn’t,” Kells responded, still completely calm and in control.  “Because you asked me for my feelings, and I gave them to you.  You asked for communication, and I gave it to you.  You are so utterly out of touch with reality, that when you encounter it, you are paralyzed because it isn’t part of the script.  You say that expressing feelings and communicating is good, but that isn’t what you mean.  You don’t want truth.  You are sheltered as far from truth as you can muster, while still being able to operate in the real world of freedom.”

Kells fell silent.

The psych opened his mouth and closed it, then again, as if he were trying hard to find something to say.

“Ironic, isn’t it?”  Kells asked, mirroring his first question.  “You belong here every bit as much as most of us do, and you’re worse than some, because you wield your power as a tool, threatening the freedom of others until they submit to your control and regurgitate the rhetoric you forcefeed them.  I wonder, Mr. Rich, why do you seek control?  What is it about your life that makes you feel totally powerless that leads you to do what you do?”

“My life is great, thank you,” the psych answered, voice outright shaking.  “I am led to help others because I like to help.”

“And you lie,” Kells said.  “You hide your emotions, while demanding that we share ours, but only the ones that agree with your textbook.  You belong here, Rich.  You are more one of us than you realize.”

The psychiatrist, Rich, I guess, couldn’t answer, but both his eyes were glazed.

A door opened to the left of the group.  It was Carrington’s office.

“Tyler Ruiz?” he asked, popping his head out of the door.

I stood up.

“Ah, good to see you again, Tyler,” the doctor said, disappearing back into his office.

I followed inside, closing his office door behind me.  Group therapy sucked.  Solo therapy sucked.  But it was rare to see something like that, for someone to speak their mind plainly, and to make so damn much sense.

I did believe that help existed here, and presumably in every other mental hospital, too.  But no matter where you go, in which part of the system you may be in, I suspected that Kells might have a point.

“Please, Tyler, have a seat,” Dr. Carrington said, waving at the two comfortable chairs in front of his large mahogany desk.

He wore a white coat that I would call a lab coat over his ever-present sweater. He even wore a sweater through all of summer, always with a tie.  Today it was a brown sweater with stripes of red and orange, very fall-like.  His tie was a plain navy blue, and was tucked into the sweater.  The lab coat, coupled with his wire frame glasses, made him look more like a mad scientist in a scary movie than a professional psychotherapist.  Psychiatrist.  Whatever he was.

“As you know, you are up for review,” Carrington said, lowering his head to look at me over the rim of his glasses with his lighter blue eyes.  His thinning brown hair was kept short.

“We would like to release you,” Dr. Carrington continued, “but of course, there is the matter of your feelings about that rather nasty business with your father.”

Kells immediately jumped into my head, with his speech about parroting the script.

“Everyone has a bad childhood,” I said, dropping my eyes from his penetrating gaze.  His desk really was magnificent.  “I think it’ll probably always hurt, but I also think that the only way to really get over it, or to recover from it, I guess, is to move on.”

I glanced back up to see that his gaze hadn’t shifted in the slightest, and he was sitting quietly.
“Moving forward in a constructive way seems like the best thing to do to heal,” I said, again thinking about Kells.  Was I parroting the right lines?  Did my mask fit my face just right?

I seriously doubted that I ran any risk of growing up to be a serial killer or anything, and really, I had heard so many stories from friends in both of the junior high schools I had gone to and the one high school that I sort of believed that line I had given about everyone having a crappy childhood.  A few people seemed to be ‘normal’ and actually enjoyed going home after school, but enough people talked enough trash about their own lives that I wondered how ‘real’ those normal people were.

I endured his stare for longer than was comfortable, but I kept remembering Kells.  Wear the mask, parrot the lines.  Don’t volunteer information, that seemed like a good thing to add to the list of survival skills.

After several seconds more, Dr. Carrington finally sat back in his chair and typed away at his keyboard, looking at one of the two monitors on the side of his desk.

“The board feels that you have made a lot of progress in processing your negative emotions,” the doc said, “and it seems as though your tests are coming back within normal, as well.  I don’t think I would feel bad about releasing you.”

He stopped typing and lowered his head to peer at me over the rims of his glasses again.  “I don’t need to remind you, however, that if you experience relapses, you will need to return to outpatient counseling, and if you deteriorate beyond that, you will be subject to being readmitted to inpatient status, where we can monitor your case in a safe environment.”

Safe.  That word seemed to have new meanings to me now that it had growing up.  Multiple meanings.  None of them what I originally thought the word meant.

“I understand,” I said.  My voice was surprisingly neutral.  I thought that I might have to fight to sound like I wasn’t being too excited about it, but instead I just sounded… calm.

“You may go back to your room, Mr. Ruiz,” Dr. Carrington said.  “I will forward the recommendation for release.  You will probably get to go home in the morning, since your mother is here in Provo.  Worst case, you’ll be back to the harshness of reality the day after tomorrow.”

Dr. Carrington’s smile told me that he had been trying to be funny with the ‘harshness of reality’ statement, and I smiled back.

“And I hear the harshness only gets worse when I get out of high school next summer, and I have to worry about still more real things like jobs and paying rent,” I said.

Dr. Carrington laughed, and it sounded genuine.  “Yeah, be sure to let me know if you need a prescription for something when you encounter that level of reality,” he said, sounding like he was probably joking.  Probably.  “Go ahead and go, and hopefully we won’t see each other again.”

I got up and left his office.  The group therapy was still in session, but Kells was missing now.  I couldn’t help but wonder what had happened to him, and why he was gone while the rest of them were still there, and the poor psych leading the group still looked to be on the verge of tears.
*****

I always thought that the meeting they have at the end there is just an excuse to give you a chance to screw up.  My mother showed up to get me just two hours after I talked with Carrington, all but confirming that my release had already been approved, suggesting that giving me that one last chance to screw up was probably a good guess.

We moved out of Utah after that, to be away from the past, away from…everything.  My mom picked a place in Colorado because she had been able to land a job in a phone interview, and only a few days after my release, we were driving past the green sign announcing that we were entering Bloodrock Ridge, Colorado, population 35,416.
I couldn't decide for sure if it looked like a small city or a large town as we drove down into the mountain valley that occupied the town.

Whatever it was, it wouldn't get much bigger. It was limited in size by the bowl shaped valley with three mountains in close proximity.

“Looks nice,” my mom said.

“Yeah,” I agreed.  “Let's hope that it really is.”

We arrived on a Tuesday, our SUV stuffed to the gills with everything we still owned after that ‘nasty business’ with my father, as Carrington would have said.  Not having a full moving truck to unload made it quick, and I had my stuff unpacked and set up in my room and had helped my mom get stuff unpacked and settled in the kitchen and living room before dinner.

I was proud of my mom.  After the fallout from my dad, she had done remarkably well pulling herself together.  I suspected that she might not be as stable on the inside, but it was nothing short of miraculous that she was keeping it together and that she had been able to get us moved a full state away from…the past.

The following morning she took me to Bloodrock Ridge Highschool and got me registered.

Thankfully I missed almost all of the first period, even though classes were really long here.  The counselor who helped me pick out classes told me that there were four classes a day, but eight total, and the school days went back and forth between ‘A’ day and ‘B’ day, but ultimately I didn't care.  I just wanted to survive this, graduate, and maybe find a girlfriend.

My mom spared me the kiss goodbye, and left to go to work, and I wandered slowly through the halls to familiarize myself with where things were.  I had made it nearly to my second period class when I heard a series of four bong noises played over the PA system, and kids began pouring out of classrooms.  Apparently the bonging is what served as a bell here.

I watched the flow of teenagers.  Bloodrock Ridge seemed to be about 85% white with an even mix of black, Hispanic, Asian, and Islanders making up the rest.  It was a little more diverse than my last school had been, and I didn't see any evidence of racial tension yet, which was good.

I did catch something that made my pulse rise a little, though.  One tough looking guy was leaning on a locker next to a smaller attractive girl swapping out books in her own locker.  She looked none too pleased by his attention.

“Whatcha doin tonight, Elizabeth?” the guy asked.  “Me?  You know it should be me.”

Stuffing her new book into her backpack, she slammed her locker.  “You'd have better luck with a girl who liked you, Tony,” she said, a touch of venom in her voice.  “Or maybe one who at least considered you human.  Get away from me.”

She pushed past him, and two other guys made the scandalous ‘ooohh’ sound, causing him to blush slightly.

“I don't want all the girls that are after me,” he called out after her.  “Only you, Elizabeth!”

Obsession was never good.

“What are you looking at?” Tony asked me as he and his two buddies moved past me.  He rammed my shoulder with his.

Brushing off the encounter, I moved into my second period class to learn all about the Byzantine empire in modern world history.  Joy. 
*****

The rest of the first day of school and most of the second turned out to be alright, and I suspected that this was going to be a good school.  I almost regretted only getting to be here for a single year.  At my previous school, incidents like Tony and Elizabeth happened a few times a day, they were entirely unavoidable.  But they seemed far more rare here, and combined with a lack of racial tension, and a general overall positive enthusiasm of the students as a whole, I was beginning to like it.

The second day I was feeling a little more relaxed, and decided I could wear my favorite jeans, which had a few holes in them, and a Megadeth tour shirt from ‘89.  Other students had worn ragged jeans without being yelled at, so I figured it would be okay.

Fourth period on that second day was geometry.  This would be an easy class for me.  I had been in it in my previous school, and just hadn't finished it.

I sat in front of a smaller boy who I had seen in one other class but didn't know his name.  But then Tony came into the class and sat a couple of desks to my right.

I had no idea if he recognized me or not, but probably not.  I made a point of not looking at him, but a question rose.  What should I do?  Bullying didn't seem to be as prevalent here as it had been in my last school, but I sure didn't want to have to deal with it at all, if I could avoid it.
Turning around, I made the choice to take the low road.

I knocked the smaller boy's geometry book and his notebook on the floor.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Tony smirk and then pull out his own book.

The boy behind me looked annoyed, very understandably, and picked his book back up.

The teacher's name was Mr. Peterson, and he had the only old school chalk board that I had seen so far in this school.  All my other classes had white boards.  When he wrote on the board, he would erase it by making parallel lines all across the board.  At first, I figured it was a compulsive thing, but then as he was making parallel lines and then intersecting them with a third line for a problem, I realized that he erased in parallel lines because it made it easier for him to put up more accurate triangles and such.  Smart.

At the end of class, just after the bell rang, I turned around in an exaggerated way, knocking the boy’s book on the floor again.

This time, Tony shook his head as he chuckled, and strode out of the class.

“Sorry, dude,” I told the guy as students filed out of the classroom, off to enjoy their evenings of freedom.

We were down to just three students left in the class now.  Me, the smaller boy, and an attractive brunette with light blue eyes.

“I don't care what your home life is like, man, leave me alone,” the boy burst out.

I had intended to apologize for real, and to explain myself.

“Problem, Mr. Brenner?” Mr. Peterson asked.

Something flared in me.  Hearing an adult use the formal last name of a teen put me immediately back in the State Hospital.

“No, I think Tyler here just needs to work through some home life issues.  I'm sure there won't be problems,” the boy said.  I had no idea he knew my name.

He clutched his math book and notebook in his hands and made his way out of class.

“Have a good day, Kyle!” the attractive brunette called out to him.

“Mr. Ruiz?” Mr. Peterson asked.

“Tyler,” I corrected him.  Hearing my last name was grating on me, reminding me too heavily of a time that I wanted very much to delete from active memory.

“And will we be having trouble from you, Mr. Ruiz?” Mr. Peterson asked.

“Whatever, man, I have a bus to catch,” I said, grabbing my book and heading for the door.  I had never suffered from anxiety until my dad, and the State Hospital, but the last names were triggering anxiety worse than Tony had.

Not two steps into the hall, I felt a hand on my shoulder, and I turned to see the attractive girl from the back of the class.

“Hi, Tyler, I'm Joanna,” she said, holding out her hand.

I stared at her hand for a moment.  Choosing the low road had been grating, the experience with Tony that led to that choice had been grating, and Mr. Peterson's insistent use of students’ last names had been the figurative icing on the cake.  But with some effort, I managed to contain myself.

“Hi,” I managed, shaking her hand.

“New to Bloodrock Ridge, eh?” she asked.

I snorted.  “Is it that obvious?”

“Bullies don't last long here,” Joanna said with what I could only describe as a dark grin.

“Why's that?” I asked, arching an eyebrow.  If that was true, maybe Tony was also new or fairly new here.

“Bullies everywhere are bullies because they are trying to mask their fear of… fill in the blank,” Joanna said.  “And in most cases, it's coupled with a sense of being totally out of control.  Bullying gives them that sense of control.  People here are quick to point that out to bullies, which makes most of them stop because it only calls attention to their inadequacies.”

Much of that sounded very much like she was either trying out for a position as an orderly at the State Hospital, or maybe that she was best friends with Kells.  Either way, it stung.

I opened my mouth to explain in great detail that while she probably wasn't wrong, I was no bully, but she cut me off.

“Justify it any way you like,” she said, “but ultimately, even if you're trying to prove you're brave to keep others from targeting you in a new school, picking on someone smaller than you doesn't make you look brave, it exposes you as being weak.  You want to be brave?  Go spend the night at the abandoned hospital.  While you're there, call out to Patient 432, and tell her it's time.  Make sure you record it so that you have evidence, because no one will believe you.  But if you ask me, I would recommend that you don't do it.”

I was no stranger to psychological tricks.  Even before my stay at the Utah State Hospital, I had been manipulated, and her last line about not recommending it after she just got done recommending it was class A manipulation.

“Why won't they believe me?” I asked.

“Because everyone who does it dies,” Joanna said, still smiling darkly.  “Which is why I would personally suggest that you don't do it.  But I also suggest that you don't create a bully image, because bullies here die.”

Although I could see right through her manipulation, I had no reason to believe that this hospital might actually be haunted.  I had survived being in a State Hospital with no real hauntings, although I did certainly suspect that damnable janitor’s closet.  Mental hospitals were easy nightmare fodder, abandoned ones even more so. Just add a couple of shadows and a rat scurrying through a leaf pile a few rooms away, and you could see someone die from fright without the need for a murderous ghost.

I smirked in spite of myself.  “Where is this hospital?”

“Tell you what,” Joanna offered.  “You go home and think it through.  Maybe ask around today and tomorrow.  When you discover that everyone who does it dies, maybe you'll get smart and not die yourself.  I'm the only one who knows that you've heard the legend now, so you won't even lose face by changing your mind about it.  If you still want to go off and die, I'll tell you where it is tomorrow.  But it doesn't look like a hospital, because it started life as a bunk house for coal miners, and there are several buildings that look the same.”",2,1770435168.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

Patient 432 [part 1 of 5]

I sat in the day room of my unit at the Utah State Hospital, looking at the others going about their daily routines.  Contrary to popular belief, or at least the belief portrayed in movies, most of the people here were mostly normal.  There were a few who definitely looked crazy, and almost everyone talked to themselves, but I wouldn’t see any of them as crazy if I ran into them at 7-11 or something out there.  Back in the real world.

Normally, I would be over by the big window, looking out at the sun, maybe playing a board game with Jessica.  She was another older teen like me, brownish red hair, and fun to be around.  She even acted like she could be interested in me.  If we were out in the real world, there could be a shot at dating her.  I didn’t want to get too close, though, because allegedly I would be getting released soon.

I looked back out the window at the massive tree out in the grounds in front of my unit, soaking up the late September sun.  Elm?  Oak?  I didn’t know.  Today I was going to talk to my primary psychiatrist about being released.

Back to the real world.

“Tyler, there you are,” a calm woman said from behind me, startling me out of my thoughts.
I jerked, pulling my gaze from the tree outside to look at the woman.

She smiled, making no note about my sudden, jerky motion.  It was commonplace here.

“It’s time to go see Doctor Carrington,” the nurse said.  Or maybe she was an orderly.  I don’t really know what the difference is.

“With a name like Carrington, he has to be official!” I quipped in a commercial announcer voice.

The nurse smiled a little bigger.  “Let’s go, Mr. Ruiz.”

I got up from the thickly upholstered chair I had been sitting in.  I wouldn’t miss the weird pale green color of that thing, that was for sure.

The nurse led me down a couple of sterile hallways, past taped markings on the ground showing us where we weren’t allowed to walk without supervision.  Mostly, we passed other patient rooms, but there was the occasional office and one rather scary looking janitor’s office that always seemed to be open.

I swear, the tiny faucet and drain for the mop bucket was possessed and haunted, and had probably been imported from an Indian burial ground, or something.  As we walked past, a great gurgling sound belched out from the drain, making me flinch.  I hated that damn room.

The nurse, to no surprise, showed no reaction at all to the noise, and led me onward.

She deposited me in a smaller version of the day room.  This one lacked the fluorescent lights of the rest of the building, and had instead gone for sparse ‘normal’ lighting.  Incandescent, I think.  The idea was probably to make the area feel more like a living room and less like the sterile hospital that it was.

There was a group therapy session going on here, and one of the younger psychiatrists was leading.
“Hello, Mr. Tyler,” the psych said.  “Go ahead and have a seat while you’re waiting on Dr. Carrington.”

I noted that he had just been talking with one of the other patients.  Talking at one of the other patients, I should say.

The man was probably in his forties, or maybe late thirties, and I only knew him as Kells, which had to be his last name.  Other patients, orderlies, and nurses, they all just called him Kells.  The guy had a short brown beard that was starting to turn gray in small spots, and hair a couple of inches long that was always messy.  He had blue eyes that felt cold, as if they were actually made of ice.  I had never heard the guy’s voice, because he just… never talked.  There were many rumors about what illness he had been diagnosed with, but no one seemed to know for sure.

“Now, Mr. Martin,” the psych said, returning his attention to Kells.  Apparently Martin was his first name- this particular psych was famous for always saying ‘Mr.’ or ‘Miss’ in front of everyone’s first names.  “If you would just communicate your feelings, we would be able to make some progress, and perhaps some of your privileges would even be returned to you.  You know that if we never make progress, any hope of release is all but non-existent.”

There were six other people sitting on chairs and couches in the loose circle, a couple with foam cups of coffee or water, and none of them seemed exactly thrilled to be here.  Not that I could blame them.

“Ironic, isn’t it?” a voice spoke.  It was coarse, but soft.  Like a guy who had done a lot of smoking, but didn’t see the need to speak above a face to face conversation level.

Holy crap.  Kells had been the one speaking.  I actually got chills.  Entire scary stories had been spun just explaining his years-long silence in this place.

“You can’t even see the fallacy of your statement,” Kells continued in a voice that was calm right down to the level of a psychopathic killer toying with his little mouse of a victim.  “You deprive others of basic rights, refer to those rights as privileges so that you can justify taking them, and then refuse to allow us basic decency unless we prance about like puppets when you pull upon our delicate strings, all the while hoping that we can’t see those strings.  You don’t care about my feelings, and you are incapable of communication.  You instead demand parroting of your rhetoric, dangling the carrot of release and the prize of being given access to uninhibited sunshine and outside air for successfully fitting into your little program.  You don’t care about my feelings, and you don’t want to hear about them, you want me to assure you of your own superiority and my adherence to your script.”

I suspected that Kells was going to continue further, but when he paused for an inhale, the psychiatrist jumped in.

“Now, now, Mr. Martin, those things aren’t true,” the psych managed, with only a little strain in his voice.  “Psychiatrists are here to help, and we do want to know your story so that we can understand you.”

“I wasn’t speaking about psychiatrists,” Kells snapped, still not raising his voice, but speaking quicker and with more force.  “I was speaking about you.  Most psychiatrists got into their work because they truly wanted to help others.  I would imagine that most of them still do want to help.  I am pointing out the flaws in your thinking- you want me to say the things that you want me to say, and you even overtly threatened to deny me freedom permanently until I decide to play your little game.”

“I did no such thing,” the psych said, stammering now.

“You did.  You told me that while I refused to communicate my feelings, any hope of release is essentially non-existent.  But you don’t want my feelings or my communication, because communication is two-way, and any real transfer of meaningful information involves a close look at not just myself, but at you, and the last thing you want, my friend,” Kells practically snarled the word friend, showing most of his teeth, “is for me to give you information about yourself.”

“I don’t have anything to hide,” the psych managed.  Sweat actually broke out on his forehead.  The other six people here were squirming in their seats, but most looked like they were trying hard to stifle a smile.

I could totally relate to that.  Sure, I agreed that most psychs probably wanted to help people, but in this place… I hadn’t seen any real help yet.  It probably existed.  People did get released from this hospital on a semi-regular basis, it wasn’t an island of no hope.  But this guy, and most of the psychs that I had dealt with… I think Kells had a point.  A damn good one.

“You have everything to hide,” Kells snapped.  His voice rose ever so slightly in volume, but he was far from shouting.  “The real tragedy here isn’t me, nor is it your ineptitude,” Kells continued.  “It is the fact that you are training these people, who have been deemed by the State of Utah as being emotionally and mentally in need of help, to better wear a mask.  You aren’t seeking truth, you aren’t seeking treatment, you are simply training these people that if they can manage to adjust their mask the right way, and recite the right lines, they might win that part on the great stage of life.  They might be rewarded with freedom and release.”

“This isn’t helping,” the psych stammered.  Now he was squirming even worse than the others.

“Of course it isn’t,” Kells responded, still completely calm and in control.  “Because you asked me for my feelings, and I gave them to you.  You asked for communication, and I gave it to you.  You are so utterly out of touch with reality, that when you encounter it, you are paralyzed because it isn’t part of the script.  You say that expressing feelings and communicating is good, but that isn’t what you mean.  You don’t want truth.  You are sheltered as far from truth as you can muster, while still being able to operate in the real world of freedom.”

Kells fell silent.

The psych opened his mouth and closed it, then again, as if he were trying hard to find something to say.

“Ironic, isn’t it?”  Kells asked, mirroring his first question.  “You belong here every bit as much as most of us do, and you’re worse than some, because you wield your power as a tool, threatening the freedom of others until they submit to your control and regurgitate the rhetoric you forcefeed them.  I wonder, Mr. Rich, why do you seek control?  What is it about your life that makes you feel totally powerless that leads you to do what you do?”

“My life is great, thank you,” the psych answered, voice outright shaking.  “I am led to help others because I like to help.”

“And you lie,” Kells said.  “You hide your emotions, while demanding that we share ours, but only the ones that agree with your textbook.  You belong here, Rich.  You are more one of us than you realize.”

The psychiatrist, Rich, I guess, couldn’t answer, but both his eyes were glazed.

A door opened to the left of the group.  It was Carrington’s office.

“Tyler Ruiz?” he asked, popping his head out of the door.

I stood up.

“Ah, good to see you again, Tyler,” the doctor said, disappearing back into his office.

I followed inside, closing his office door behind me.  Group therapy sucked.  Solo therapy sucked.  But it was rare to see something like that, for someone to speak their mind plainly, and to make so damn much sense.

I did believe that help existed here, and presumably in every other mental hospital, too.  But no matter where you go, in which part of the system you may be in, I suspected that Kells might have a point.

“Please, Tyler, have a seat,” Dr. Carrington said, waving at the two comfortable chairs in front of his large mahogany desk.

He wore a white coat that I would call a lab coat over his ever-present sweater. He even wore a sweater through all of summer, always with a tie.  Today it was a brown sweater with stripes of red and orange, very fall-like.  His tie was a plain navy blue, and was tucked into the sweater.  The lab coat, coupled with his wire frame glasses, made him look more like a mad scientist in a scary movie than a professional psychotherapist.  Psychiatrist.  Whatever he was.

“As you know, you are up for review,” Carrington said, lowering his head to look at me over the rim of his glasses with his lighter blue eyes.  His thinning brown hair was kept short.

“We would like to release you,” Dr. Carrington continued, “but of course, there is the matter of your feelings about that rather nasty business with your father.”

Kells immediately jumped into my head, with his speech about parroting the script.

“Everyone has a bad childhood,” I said, dropping my eyes from his penetrating gaze.  His desk really was magnificent.  “I think it’ll probably always hurt, but I also think that the only way to really get over it, or to recover from it, I guess, is to move on.”

I glanced back up to see that his gaze hadn’t shifted in the slightest, and he was sitting quietly.
“Moving forward in a constructive way seems like the best thing to do to heal,” I said, again thinking about Kells.  Was I parroting the right lines?  Did my mask fit my face just right?

I seriously doubted that I ran any risk of growing up to be a serial killer or anything, and really, I had heard so many stories from friends in both of the junior high schools I had gone to and the one high school that I sort of believed that line I had given about everyone having a crappy childhood.  A few people seemed to be ‘normal’ and actually enjoyed going home after school, but enough people talked enough trash about their own lives that I wondered how ‘real’ those normal people were.

I endured his stare for longer than was comfortable, but I kept remembering Kells.  Wear the mask, parrot the lines.  Don’t volunteer information, that seemed like a good thing to add to the list of survival skills.

After several seconds more, Dr. Carrington finally sat back in his chair and typed away at his keyboard, looking at one of the two monitors on the side of his desk.

“The board feels that you have made a lot of progress in processing your negative emotions,” the doc said, “and it seems as though your tests are coming back within normal, as well.  I don’t think I would feel bad about releasing you.”

He stopped typing and lowered his head to peer at me over the rims of his glasses again.  “I don’t need to remind you, however, that if you experience relapses, you will need to return to outpatient counseling, and if you deteriorate beyond that, you will be subject to being readmitted to inpatient status, where we can monitor your case in a safe environment.”

Safe.  That word seemed to have new meanings to me now that it had growing up.  Multiple meanings.  None of them what I originally thought the word meant.

“I understand,” I said.  My voice was surprisingly neutral.  I thought that I might have to fight to sound like I wasn’t being too excited about it, but instead I just sounded… calm.

“You may go back to your room, Mr. Ruiz,” Dr. Carrington said.  “I will forward the recommendation for release.  You will probably get to go home in the morning, since your mother is here in Provo.  Worst case, you’ll be back to the harshness of reality the day after tomorrow.”

Dr. Carrington’s smile told me that he had been trying to be funny with the ‘harshness of reality’ statement, and I smiled back.

“And I hear the harshness only gets worse when I get out of high school next summer, and I have to worry about still more real things like jobs and paying rent,” I said.

Dr. Carrington laughed, and it sounded genuine.  “Yeah, be sure to let me know if you need a prescription for something when you encounter that level of reality,” he said, sounding like he was probably joking.  Probably.  “Go ahead and go, and hopefully we won’t see each other again.”

I got up and left his office.  The group therapy was still in session, but Kells was missing now.  I couldn’t help but wonder what had happened to him, and why he was gone while the rest of them were still there, and the poor psych leading the group still looked to be on the verge of tears.
*****

I always thought that the meeting they have at the end there is just an excuse to give you a chance to screw up.  My mother showed up to get me just two hours after I talked with Carrington, all but confirming that my release had already been approved, suggesting that giving me that one last chance to screw up was probably a good guess.

We moved out of Utah after that, to be away from the past, away from…everything.  My mom picked a place in Colorado because she had been able to land a job in a phone interview, and only a few days after my release, we were driving past the green sign announcing that we were entering Bloodrock Ridge, Colorado, population 35,416.
I couldn't decide for sure if it looked like a small city or a large town as we drove down into the mountain valley that occupied the town.

Whatever it was, it wouldn't get much bigger. It was limited in size by the bowl shaped valley with three mountains in close proximity.

“Looks nice,” my mom said.

“Yeah,” I agreed.  “Let's hope that it really is.”

We arrived on a Tuesday, our SUV stuffed to the gills with everything we still owned after that ‘nasty business’ with my father, as Carrington would have said.  Not having a full moving truck to unload made it quick, and I had my stuff unpacked and set up in my room and had helped my mom get stuff unpacked and settled in the kitchen and living room before dinner.

I was proud of my mom.  After the fallout from my dad, she had done remarkably well pulling herself together.  I suspected that she might not be as stable on the inside, but it was nothing short of miraculous that she was keeping it together and that she had been able to get us moved a full state away from…the past.

The following morning she took me to Bloodrock Ridge Highschool and got me registered.

Thankfully I missed almost all of the first period, even though classes were really long here.  The counselor who helped me pick out classes told me that there were four classes a day, but eight total, and the school days went back and forth between ‘A’ day and ‘B’ day, but ultimately I didn't care.  I just wanted to survive this, graduate, and maybe find a girlfriend.

My mom spared me the kiss goodbye, and left to go to work, and I wandered slowly through the halls to familiarize myself with where things were.  I had made it nearly to my second period class when I heard a series of four bong noises played over the PA system, and kids began pouring out of classrooms.  Apparently the bonging is what served as a bell here.

I watched the flow of teenagers.  Bloodrock Ridge seemed to be about 85% white with an even mix of black, Hispanic, Asian, and Islanders making up the rest.  It was a little more diverse than my last school had been, and I didn't see any evidence of racial tension yet, which was good.

I did catch something that made my pulse rise a little, though.  One tough looking guy was leaning on a locker next to a smaller attractive girl swapping out books in her own locker.  She looked none too pleased by his attention.

“Whatcha doin tonight, Elizabeth?” the guy asked.  “Me?  You know it should be me.”

Stuffing her new book into her backpack, she slammed her locker.  “You'd have better luck with a girl who liked you, Tony,” she said, a touch of venom in her voice.  “Or maybe one who at least considered you human.  Get away from me.”

She pushed past him, and two other guys made the scandalous ‘ooohh’ sound, causing him to blush slightly.

“I don't want all the girls that are after me,” he called out after her.  “Only you, Elizabeth!”

Obsession was never good.

“What are you looking at?” Tony asked me as he and his two buddies moved past me.  He rammed my shoulder with his.

Brushing off the encounter, I moved into my second period class to learn all about the Byzantine empire in modern world history.  Joy. 
*****

The rest of the first day of school and most of the second turned out to be alright, and I suspected that this was going to be a good school.  I almost regretted only getting to be here for a single year.  At my previous school, incidents like Tony and Elizabeth happened a few times a day, they were entirely unavoidable.  But they seemed far more rare here, and combined with a lack of racial tension, and a general overall positive enthusiasm of the students as a whole, I was beginning to like it.

The second day I was feeling a little more relaxed, and decided I could wear my favorite jeans, which had a few holes in them, and a Megadeth tour shirt from ‘89.  Other students had worn ragged jeans without being yelled at, so I figured it would be okay.

Fourth period on that second day was geometry.  This would be an easy class for me.  I had been in it in my previous school, and just hadn't finished it.

I sat in front of a smaller boy who I had seen in one other class but didn't know his name.  But then Tony came into the class and sat a couple of desks to my right.

I had no idea if he recognized me or not, but probably not.  I made a point of not looking at him, but a question rose.  What should I do?  Bullying didn't seem to be as prevalent here as it had been in my last school, but I sure didn't want to have to deal with it at all, if I could avoid it.
Turning around, I made the choice to take the low road.

I knocked the smaller boy's geometry book and his notebook on the floor.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Tony smirk and then pull out his own book.

The boy behind me looked annoyed, very understandably, and picked his book back up.

The teacher's name was Mr. Peterson, and he had the only old school chalk board that I had seen so far in this school.  All my other classes had white boards.  When he wrote on the board, he would erase it by making parallel lines all across the board.  At first, I figured it was a compulsive thing, but then as he was making parallel lines and then intersecting them with a third line for a problem, I realized that he erased in parallel lines because it made it easier for him to put up more accurate triangles and such.  Smart.

At the end of class, just after the bell rang, I turned around in an exaggerated way, knocking the boy’s book on the floor again.

This time, Tony shook his head as he chuckled, and strode out of the class.

“Sorry, dude,” I told the guy as students filed out of the classroom, off to enjoy their evenings of freedom.

We were down to just three students left in the class now.  Me, the smaller boy, and an attractive brunette with light blue eyes.

“I don't care what your home life is like, man, leave me alone,” the boy burst out.

I had intended to apologize for real, and to explain myself.

“Problem, Mr. Brenner?” Mr. Peterson asked.

Something flared in me.  Hearing an adult use the formal last name of a teen put me immediately back in the State Hospital.

“No, I think Tyler here just needs to work through some home life issues.  I'm sure there won't be problems,” the boy said.  I had no idea he knew my name.

He clutched his math book and notebook in his hands and made his way out of class.

“Have a good day, Kyle!” the attractive brunette called out to him.

“Mr. Ruiz?” Mr. Peterson asked.

“Tyler,” I corrected him.  Hearing my last name was grating on me, reminding me too heavily of a time that I wanted very much to delete from active memory.

“And will we be having trouble from you, Mr. Ruiz?” Mr. Peterson asked.

“Whatever, man, I have a bus to catch,” I said, grabbing my book and heading for the door.  I had never suffered from anxiety until my dad, and the State Hospital, but the last names were triggering anxiety worse than Tony had.

Not two steps into the hall, I felt a hand on my shoulder, and I turned to see the attractive girl from the back of the class.

“Hi, Tyler, I'm Joanna,” she said, holding out her hand.

I stared at her hand for a moment.  Choosing the low road had been grating, the experience with Tony that led to that choice had been grating, and Mr. Peterson's insistent use of students’ last names had been the figurative icing on the cake.  But with some effort, I managed to contain myself.

“Hi,” I managed, shaking her hand.

“New to Bloodrock Ridge, eh?” she asked.

I snorted.  “Is it that obvious?”

“Bullies don't last long here,” Joanna said with what I could only describe as a dark grin.

“Why's that?” I asked, arching an eyebrow.  If that was true, maybe Tony was also new or fairly new here.

“Bullies everywhere are bullies because they are trying to mask their fear of… fill in the blank,” Joanna said.  “And in most cases, it's coupled with a sense of being totally out of control.  Bullying gives them that sense of control.  People here are quick to point that out to bullies, which makes most of them stop because it only calls attention to their inadequacies.”

Much of that sounded very much like she was either trying out for a position as an orderly at the State Hospital, or maybe that she was best friends with Kells.  Either way, it stung.

I opened my mouth to explain in great detail that while she probably wasn't wrong, I was no bully, but she cut me off.

“Justify it any way you like,” she said, “but ultimately, even if you're trying to prove you're brave to keep others from targeting you in a new school, picking on someone smaller than you doesn't make you look brave, it exposes you as being weak.  You want to be brave?  Go spend the night at the abandoned hospital.  While you're there, call out to Patient 432, and tell her it's time.  Make sure you record it so that you have evidence, because no one will believe you.  But if you ask me, I would recommend that you don't do it.”

I was no stranger to psychological tricks.  Even before my stay at the Utah State Hospital, I had been manipulated, and her last line about not recommending it after she just got done recommending it was class A manipulation.

“Why won't they believe me?” I asked.

“Because everyone who does it dies,” Joanna said, still smiling darkly.  “Which is why I would personally suggest that you don't do it.  But I also suggest that you don't create a bully image, because bullies here die.”

Although I could see right through her manipulation, I had no reason to believe that this hospital might actually be haunted.  I had survived being in a State Hospital with no real hauntings, although I did certainly suspect that damnable janitor’s closet.  Mental hospitals were easy nightmare fodder, abandoned ones even more so. Just add a couple of shadows and a rat scurrying through a leaf pile a few rooms away, and you could see someone die from fright without the need for a murderous ghost.

I smirked in spite of myself.  “Where is this hospital?”

“Tell you what,” Joanna offered.  “You go home and think it through.  Maybe ask around today and tomorrow.  When you discover that everyone who does it dies, maybe you'll get smart and not die yourself.  I'm the only one who knows that you've heard the legend now, so you won't even lose face by changing your mind about it.  If you still want to go off and die, I'll tell you where it is tomorrow.  But it doesn't look like a hospital, because it started life as a bunk house for coal miners, and there are several buildings that look the same.”",2,1770434893.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1qy2xcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1qy2xcf/who_will_take_care_of_you/,“Who will take care of you?”,"This has no real point and may be disjointed. I just wanted to vent to people who get it. 

My parents had a running “joke” about why they had kids. “So we don’t have to do these things anymore!” I knew how to make coffee to each of their standards by the time I was seven. I’d ask “why do I have to make your coffee?” And mostly mom would respond with “that’s why I had kids.”

Note here, they wanted to have kids together. My father wanted a son so after I was born mom couldn’t get her tubes tied for a while. Five years later my brother arrived and she got her wish. Huzzah. So I know they don’t have kids to be servants but my neurotic brain took it to heart after years and years. 

Anyway, back to the title. People ask us who will take care of us when we’re old and sick if we don’t have kids. Since my father did in 2015, I have seen my mom on the verge of death at least three times. The last time was when she was hospitalized with COVID. She couldn’t stay awake. She was frail. I was researching hospice care because I was freaking out. Two weeks of her hanging in a sort of limbo. 

The whole time I was thinking about how **selfish** it is to have kids just to be taken care of in illness and age. No one who isn’t well versed and educated in the issue should have to carry that. It’s ***heavy***! I felt like I was dragging a boulder behind me every day. 

She recovered and a year or so later moved halfway across the country to live with her sister. It’s been three years. She’s been hospitalized with illness three or four times and had some surgeries. Last week she had pneumonia. My father went into the hospital with that and died soon after. My father in law got it while recovering from a fall and did soon after. Cue that same panic I felt when she had COVID. Today her doctor said she has COPD. 

Who will take care of me when I’m old and sick? A fucking medical staff. People who know how to be caregivers. If I had children and I was on my deathbed I would want them to be using their energy to love, to live to the best of their ability, not making sure I’m hydrated or fed or haven’t sat in my own bodily fluids or whatever. 

I’m the middle child (mom has a son from her first marriage) but I’m the oldest of my parents’ children so it all fell on me. And it all will fall on me again and again. 

Every time someone says being child free is selfish I remember the panic, the weight…",2,1770434887.0,childfree,0,1.0,False
1qy2wpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1qy2wpb/would_you_recommend_bali_to_your_past_self_as_a/,Would you recommend Bali to your past self as a first nomad destination?,"If I could go back in time and sit down with my younger self, who was still unsure about starting life as a digital nomad, I think my answer would remain the same. Yes, I would still choose Bali as my first destination.

It might sound biased, and yes, I do have an emotional attachment to this island. But that feeling grew from real experiences, not just a first impression.

I have lived in other places that were also very enjoyable. Chiang Mai in Thailand, for example. Life there felt organized and easy, everything ran smoothly, the community was active, and the cost of living was friendly. I also spent time in Da Nang and Hoi An in Vietnam, enjoying morning coffee, quiet beaches, and a relaxed yet lively daily rhythm.

**But Bali gives a different feeling.**

From the moment I first landed, I did not feel like a guest, but rather like I was coming home to a place I had known for a long time. There is something about Bali that is hard to put into words. Maybe it is the sound of gamelan music in the distance, the smell of incense in the morning, or the way locals greet you with a warm and genuine smile.

Bali has two sides that exist together. Sometimes it feels chaotic, with heavy traffic and the sound of motorbikes everywhere. But at the same time, there is always a sense of calm you can find if you look for it. You can work from a coworking space in Canggu, then take a short walk to the beach to watch the sunset. You can start your day with yoga in Ubud, then spend the evening in deep conversation with new friends from around the world.

What left the strongest impression on me is the community. In Bali, I met many creative people, freelancers, business owners, and individuals searching for meaning in life. Bali did not just feel like a place to live, but like a space to grow. Conversations felt deeper, ideas flowed more freely, and human connections felt warmer. That is an experience I rarely found elsewhere.

Of course, Bali is not without challenges. Traffic can test your patience, the internet can sometimes be unstable, and the weather can change without warning. But that is also where the learning happens. Bali taught me to be more patient, more flexible, and more present in each moment.

Now I am curious about your perspective. If you could go back to the beginning of your nomad journey, would you also still choose Bali as your first destination as I did, or would you pick another place instead? Why?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

[Masonic Tantrum After I Exposed the Truth - Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/masonic-tantrum-after-i-exposed-truth-QOKvKS9)



Here is their secret

Study astrology, alchemy, witchcraft, voodoo, etc. The topics that they want you to believe are ridiculous. They are very real. They don't want you to study it because they don't want you to gain that much power and use it against them.  

The 12 apostles are based on the 12 zodiac signs. Jesus lived to be 33 years old, there are also 33 degrees in the Masonic Scottish Rite. There are 33 bones in your spine. The kundalini begins at the base of your spine when the moon passes through your zodiac sign each month.  

They intentionally threw off this cycle by making 12 months in a year rather than 13 months to match the 13 zodiac signs. The solar calendar does not match the lunar calendar on purpose. The 13th zodiac was erased from history. The Ophiuchus or the serpent bearer, like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent in the garden is debated to be Lucifer. Both Lucifer and Jesus are known as the morning star. Venus is also known as the morning star. 

Each day it ascends one bone as long as you refrain from the deadly sins. No sex, no wrath, no gluttony, that's why fasting is important. And also, why we as Americans are over fed and have a higher rate of obesity. Because they are trying to stuff our faces with food, so we don't accidentally open our third eye. Also, no acidic foods. It will destroy the kundalini. No coffee either. If it is a major addiction in the US then avoid it. No caffeine, no sugar, no nicotine, no drugs, and so on. The only exception is DMT, I know this is a psychedelic drug that they use in their rituals to assist in opening their third eye.  

Everything in the US is structured to make sure we never reach this state.  

Lust, Men are taught that the more women they have sex with the cooler they are. Women are taught that OnlyFans is empowering. Porn is also free and sex is in all media.  

Envy, we are taught to envy the rich. Their expensive homes, their fast cars, designer clothes, and exotic trips. 

Wrath, we are taught to hate each other for one reason or another whether it be for race, religion, sex, political beliefs, etc.  

Pride, we are taught to take pride in our nation to the point of ignorance and blind belief in authority. 

Gluttony, we are overfed as Americans which is why we have such a high rate of obesity. Our food is also tainted with ingredients that hinder our chances of reaching this state. Eat kosher foods, the tiny hats that are hiding this information would not do this to their own people.

Sloth, we are fed sites like Tik Tok and social media where we spend more time doom scrolling than we do exercising or attempting to build a better life for ourselves. 

Greed, we are taught to look out after ourselves only. We are made to believe in the scarcity mindset, where there aren't enough resources to go around so we keep more for ourselves and never share.  We take more than we need and even at the cost of others.

You must also feel authentic compassion towards others. The point is to open your heart. The saying ""Heart of gold"" did not come from nowhere. Scientists found that there are more pathways sending signals from the heart to the brain than from the brain to the heart. There is a reason the heart was considered the most important part of your body in ancient times. 

Once it makes it to the top of our spine into the pineal gland it stays there for a few days. Jesus was resurrected on the third day. On the third day it drops down back to the base of our spine.  

Congratulations you are now a god. You can manipulate reality around you and even read minds of others. Your mind will exist on a higher plane than this 3 dimensional one so you can access other objects that are on that plane though unconsciously, including other people's minds. You will retain your memory after death because this body is temporary, but your mind has now accessed a higher plane of existence. You will be born in a new body after some time of void and darkness, but you will keep all the memories of your past life. You are now also immortal.  

I believe they may have possibly left some information out, but this is the truth that I know so far. You may have to wait until the full moon passes through your zodiac sign. You also might have to do the Wim Hoff miracle breathing technique regularly while meditating on your chakras. And they may have left out important information about Venus, but I am not sure.  ",1,1770434637.0,circled,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qy2oog,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltBeautyHub/comments/1qy2oog/finally_mastered_that_90s_alt_grungy_lip_stain/,"Finally mastered that '90s alt grungy lip stain I've been chasing: (achieved with sheer lipstick and a damp sponge, zero liner needed) 🖤","You know that feeling when you're flipping through aesthetics boards, and you land on something impossibly cool – like ""literary gothic"" – and think, ""Yeah, but how do I *actually* do that without a full costume department or spending a fortune?"" That was me last week. I wanted to capture a moody, slightly undone literary gothic vibe for a casual coffee shop trip, but with the specific challenge of *not* buying anything new and keeping it low effort. No intricate eyeliner, no perfectly carved cheekbones, just... atmosphere.

My goal wasn't perfection, but rather to see if I could evoke a sense of brooding romance and subtle drama using what I already had, focusing on texture and strategic smudging over sharp lines. Turns out, embracing a bit of ""chaotic curator"" energy in the process worked wonders.

Here’s what my low-fuss, high-mood literary gothic experiment looked like:

*   **The Vibe:** Less ""perfectly coiffed Victorian dame,"" more ""writer who just emerged from a dusty archive after an all-nighter, but still looks intriguing.""
*   **Base (The ""Barely There But Better"" Edit):**
    *   Instead of a full foundation, I used a sheer skin tint (Elf Halo Glow Liquid Filter in Fair/Light – around $14) focused on the center of my face, blended out. The goal was a slightly luminous, but not overly 'done' look.
    *   A touch of concealer (Maybelline Age Rewind in Fair – about $10) under eyes and on any redness, lightly pressed in with a finger.
*   **Eyes (The ""Intentional Smudge""):**
    *   This was the core. I grabbed an old eyeshadow single I rarely use: a deep, almost blackened plum shimmer (ColourPop Super Shock Shadow in 'Amaze' – around $7, but you could use any dark purple or even a deep brown).
    *   I applied it directly to my lid with my finger, focusing on the outer half, and then used a small fluffy brush (or another clean finger) to smoke it out towards the temples, keeping it soft and diffused. No hard lines, just a veil of color.
    *   For depth, I took a charcoal grey eyeliner pencil (Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer in 'Blackest Black' – about $7) and smudged it *into* my upper lash line, then quickly blended it out with a small brush to create a soft, undefined shadow rather than a harsh line.
*   **Brows (The ""Unfussy Arch""):**
    *   Just a clear brow gel (NYX Control Freak Brow Gel – about $7) to tidy them up. I wanted them to look natural and slightly untamed, fitting the 'chaotic curator' sub-aesthetic.
*   **Lips (The ""Just Bitten Bloom""):**
    *   A deep berry stain was essential. I used a classic: Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick in 'Black Cherry' (around $9). Instead of applying it directly, I dabbed a tiny amount onto the center of my lips and then pressed my lips together, blurring the color out with my finger for a soft, diffused, 'just bitten' effect. It was less about precision and more about a bruised, rich tint.
*   **Time Invested:** Honestly, about 15-20 minutes. The smudging was forgiving.

**Real Talk & Lessons Learned:**
My first attempt at the eyes was a bit heavy-handed. I initially tried to create too much definition, and it looked... like I was trying too hard. I wiped some of it away and realized the key was *less* product and *more* blending. The beauty of this kind of look, I found, is in its imperfection. The smudged liner wasn't perfectly symmetrical, and the lip stain wasn't perfectly contained – and that was precisely what gave it character and prevented it from looking like a theatrical production. It felt more authentic, less about trying to mimic a flawless image and more about embodying a mood. It wasn't 'flawless', but it felt deeply *right* for the vibe.

 When Alan came back, he said Benkei was getting our food order ready for me to pick up. And that I could head out to go pick it up in a few. 

 

 “Wait for me, NPC. I'm coming with you.” Leo chased after me as I left Vagastrom.

 

 “Why? It's not like I need your help carrying a few cups of noodles or sandwiches.”

 

 “Oh, you don't know Cap like you think you do. He wasn't ordering a few measly sandwiches. He probably wants to thank you for being his first girlfriend, even if it was pretend.” 

 

 “You really think he's never had a girlfriend? That can't be right. I mean the whole reason I had to pretend to be his girlfriend was because he caught someone's eye.” 

 

 “He may have caught someone's eye, but he doesn't have eyes for anyone else. Cap prefers people say what they mean and mean what they say. I'm sure plenty of girls have thrown themselves at him, but none of them are you.”

 

 Leo walked ahead, leaving me behind to gather myself.

 

 When we arrived at the store, Benkei greeted us warmly before going to grab our food. He came back with several bags, full of food containers. It definitely didn't look like the store's usual inventory. This must have been something special just for us. 

 

 “Did you prepare all this food yourself, Benkei?” I asked.

 

 “Yes! I learned how to make sushi, mostly as a hobby, but sometimes,  Alan requests my services. Usually only for special occasions. I also made Alan some grilled chicken, rice, and miso soup, the sushi alone won't be enough for his appetite Oh, but please don't advertise this to the other students, I don't think I'd be able to keep up with the demand.” 

 

 I tried giving Benkei an additional tip for going through so much trouble for us, but he refused saying Alan already took care of everything, and that he was more than happy to provide us lunch.

 

 It wasn't long before we'd made our way back to Vagastrom, sushi in hand. We'd decided to eat in Vagastrom's common area since it was mostly free of students. Leo flopped down on the couch, taking up all the seats. I began unpacking our food, but Sho stopped me.

 

 “You picked it up for us, let me set it up for you, Senpai. Leo, make some room.”

 

 Leo looked up at me, his mischievous look on full display.

 

 “There's plenty of room right here,” Leo patted his lap playfully.

 

 Sho finished setting our lunch out, then he grabbed Leo's ankles and moved his feet to the floor. But Leo wasn't giving up without a fight.  Both boys became annoyed in the process. I couldn't help the chuckle that escaped my lips. 

 

 “No one wants to sit in your lap, least of all her.” Sho was yanking Leo's upper body back to an upright position.

 

 “Don't get jealous Sho, I'll let you sit in my lap instead. Come here!” Leo grabbed Sho by his waist and tried pulling him down onto the couch. But Sho remained on his feet.

 

 I decided to take a seat in a nearby chair, across from Sho and Leo. 

 

 “Where's Alan?” I asked.

 

 As if on cue, Alan came striding in with his hands in his pockets.

 

 “I had to step outside for a minute. . .” I waited for Alan to say something more, but he left it at that.

 

 “No worries! We were just getting ready to eat. Thanks for treating us.” I smiled.

 

 Alan made his way over, his dark grey eyes falling on the seat next to mine. 

 

 “Don't worry Cap, she doesn't bark or bite!” Leo had already started loading his plate up with all the spicy sushi Alan had ordered.

 

 “Leo, don't take all the spicy stuff. What if Senpai wants some too?” Sho scolded.

 

Leo added some extra hot sauce to his food, ignoring Sho. 

 

 We had all served ourselves, with Alan having the largest portion. When Leo wasn't looking I stole a piece of his extra spicy tuna.

 

 “I wouldn't do that if I was you, Leo is serious about spice.” Sho warned me, alerting Leo to my shenanigans.

 

 “I'd like to see her try and handle the heat.” 

 

 Alan stood, leaving his food untouched. I only heard the latter half of the sentence he uttered, ‘right back’. 

 

 “Do you dare me to eat it, Leo?” I was planning on trying it anyway, but wanted to see if he'd play along. 

 

 “I don't just dare you, I double-dare you.” Leo egged on.

 

 I lifted the sushi to my mouth and took a bite. At first, it wasn't that hot, but then the heat hit me all at once. It shot up to my nose, and down the back of my throat. I immediately covered my mouth so I didn't spit sushi everywhere. I needed to cough or breathe or something.

 

 “Here.” I could sense Alan standing behind me, a bottle of water in his hand, which he was dangling in front of me.

 

 I took the water and washed down the spice, grateful for Alan's forethought. The bottle of water was nearly gone by the time I'd recovered from Leo's deadly spicy tuna.

 

 “Thanks, Alan. I guess you were right, Sho, I should have heeded your warning.”

 

 Alan chuckled before ruffling my hair in his hand. I only caught a brief glimpse of his rare smile as he laughed.

 

 “The face you made! You got all red, and your eyes were nearly bugging out of your head! I can't believe I got a pic at just the right moment.” Leo was laughing so hard he had to put his hand on his stomach to get it under control.

 

 “Leo likes to set his insides ablaze, I don't how he doesn't have some sort of stomach ulcer.”

 

 “My stomach's made of steel, I could probably drink hot sauce like water.”

 

 “For the sake of the dorm's bathroom, please don't.” Alan interjected.

 

 I laughed, triggering a symphony of coughing in the process. Some of the previous heat, coming back up my throat. I drank the last of the bottled water to settle it.

 

 “You alright Senpai?” Sho sounded genuinely concerned.

 

 “Yeah, fine! Uh, Alan, how's your chicken and rice?” I tried changing the subject.

 

 “It's good. Benkei knows I need a lot of protein and carbs,” Alan picked up some of his food, “here, have a bite of this. It'll help you recover from Leo's spice bomb.” 

 

 Alan had reached his long arm over to me, holding a small bite of chicken and rice. I hesitated, feeling a little awkward about him trying to feed me.

 

 “Get a room, you two!” Leo sounded annoyed, Sho remained silent.

 

 Caught off guard by Leo, Alan tried promptly retracting his hand from where it waited awkwardly. Without thinking, I grabbed his wrist, holding it in place while I took a bite of his food. Alan seemed startled by my sudden touch, but relaxed a little. It was slight, but the corners of his lips turned up into a modest smile. 

‘click’

 

 “Perfect! I'm gonna send this to that mop headed, freckled, flop.” Based on the flash that came from Leo's phone, I assumed he took a picture.

 

 “Delete it now.” Alan was stern with his tone, but the bright pink flushing of his cheeks gave him away.

 

 “What, why?” Leo protested.

 

 “Just, do it Leo.” Sho scolded between bites.

 

 “Before you delete it, can you send it to me? I'd really like to have it, if it's okay with Alan that is.” I searched his dark grey eyes for permission.

 

 “That's fine. Print me a copy. But once it's done. Delete it.” Alan agreed.

 

 “Print you a copy? Fine, I'm sending it to my printer now. I'll just print you both a copy, and delete the digital.” Leo didn't seem happy to be deleting the photo, but I watched as he begrudgingly hit the trash button, then cleared it from his deleted photo folder. But something told me, even then it wasn't really gone for good. Leo probably already figured a way to save it elsewhere. 

 

 By the time we all finished eating lunch and letting our food digest, it was pretty late in the afternoon. Mostly Sho and I chatted while Alan listened, and Leo stared at his phone. But it wasn't long before Leo excused himself. Most likely to check that no other videos of Vagastrom's indiscretion were going around. Sho had some school work to catch up on, so he headed to his dorm room.

 

 Alan and I were left alone once again. I nervously twisted my hair, unsure if I should call it a day or not. Alan began cleaning up the table in silence. Unsure of what to do with myself, I started helping him. 

 

 “You don't have to help.” Is all he said.

 

 Caught off guard by how abrupt his words were, I left the rest to Alan. 

 

 “Honor Roll! I have that picture you wanted.” Leo called out in a sing-song voice. 

 “I already hung up Cap's copy in his room.”

 

 Leo handed me an envelope which I assume held the photo of me and Alan. I grabbed it a little too excitedly. 

 

 “Thank you Leo!” I smiled brightly at him, opening the envelope to see if Leo caught it.

 It was a little hard to see, but it was there. Leo caught Alan's smile on camera.

 

 Just then, we heard Alan's abdomen groan. It sounded like he hadn't gotten enough to eat, even after all the food Benkei had made specifically for Alan. I pretended not to hear it at first.

 

 “Jeez Cap, hungry much? How are you not full after all that food you ate?” Leo shook his head at Alan.

 

 “Hey, if you're still hungry, why don't we go back to the store together. Get something for dessert? I think I saw some coffee cakes that don't look too sweet.” Alan didn't seem like the type to eat sweets, but I took a chance.

 

 “Okay. Let's go.” 

 

 I shooed Leo away, causing him to wink at me. I pretended not to see it and left Vagastrom with Alan. Our walk to the store was a quiet one, but I didn't mind it. Today, he's said more than I could hope for. 

 

 When we arrived I grabbed a hand basket and began shopping. I grabbed snacks both salty and sweet, along with drinks, and lastly I surveyed the cakes and other dessert type foods.

 Alan's long arm reached across me, grabbing a small plastic cup and tossing it in the basket.

 

 “What's that?” I inquired.

 

 “Coffee Jelly. I like drinking coffee, and I don't like things that are too sweet. So I want to try it.” 

 

 “Sounds like it could be a good dessert option for you, then!” 

 

 “What kind of desserts do you like?” 

 

 “I usually go for something extra sweet. Strawberry shortcake, cinnamon rolls, macrons. But I think this time I'm going to get this,” I held up a perfectly packaged slice of tiramisu.

 

 Alan's eyes widened at the sight of the tasty treat.

 

 “What's that?”

 

 “Tiramisu. It's ladyfingers that have been soaked in coffee, it also has egg yolks, sugar, mascarpone, and it's topped with cocoa powder.”

 

 “Sounds. . . Good.” 

 

 “How about I let you have a bite of mine, and I'll have a bite of yours?” 

 

 Alan turned a deep red, and shuffled towards the register.

 

 “If you're done shopping, we should pay and go.” 

 

 I hadn't been trying to tease him, but I think that's how he took it. I didn't want to embarrass him anymore than I had. So we checked out with our snacks, and left.

 

 “Will you sit with me, Alan?” I gestured to a free bench nearby. 

 

 Alan nodded and sat down at one end of the bench. I sat down at the other end and placed our bag of snacks between us. Hopefully everything we got would satisfy Alan's appetite. I opened the bag of chips and offered him some, he grabbed a few, snacking quietly.

 

 “I wanted to ask you, why did you want to keep that photo Leo took?” Alan's voice was serious.

 

 “I just really like the photo, that's all.” I didn't want to tell him the real reason, not yet.

 

 “I'm sorry it's difficult to talk to me. Sometimes I think the absence of words says more than any string of words I could come up with. Other times I really don't know what to say. I'm just sort of awkward.” Alan explained.

 

  “That's okay. I just like being around you. You don't have to say or do anything, other than be yourself.”

 

 The two of us left the conversation at that for a little while, just enjoying one another's company in silence. We'd almost made our way through most of the food, saving our respective desserts for last.

 

 “How is your tiramisu?” 

 

 “It's good. It's actually a good combination of strong and sweet. It tastes like the ladyfingers weren't just soaked in any coffee. It's like it was soaked in a really strong espresso. But the sweeter aspects of it really balance it out.”

 

 “Should we. . . Trade bites?” Alan stumbled.

 

 I lifted my fork to his mouth, not bothering to respond verbally. Alan took a bite, his eyebrows raised slightly. It looked like he was pleasantly surprised. 

 

 “It's really good, isn't it? My turn! Can I have a bite of your coffee jelly?”

 

 Alan scooped a portion of the gelatinous coffee into his spoon before feeding me some.

 

 “It's kind of plain, but I don't mind it.” Alan didn't sound too enthusiastic, but I believed him.

 

 “It's pretty good, I think I'd get some whipped cream and some caramel drizzle to make it a bit sweeter. But I can see why you like it. It's simple, and can be eaten plain, or it can be added to.”

 

 We cleaned up after ourselves, but I wasn't ready to let Alan go just yet. I asked him to walk me to my dorm and he agreed he would. 

 

 “I'm sorry you missed out on classes today.” Alan apologized for the day we'd had so far.

 

 “I'm always happy to help in any way I can. I miss classes for missions all the time. It's no big deal. By the way, I never asked you why you wanted to keep the photo of us.”

 

 “I don't have a lot of photos. Of myself or of other people.”

 

 I decided if I didn't tell him now, I might not have the guts to tell him later.

 

 “I wasn't totally honest with you earlier, about why I wanted to keep our photo. The real reason is because they say a picture's worth a thousand words. But for me, that picture is worth more than a million.” I pulled the photo out, “Do you see what I see?”

 

 Alan shook his head, seemingly confused. 

 

 “If you look close enough, you're smiling in this photo.”

 

 Alan turned his face away from me, no doubt feeling shy. As we came upon my dorm, Alan came to a stop.

 

 “I should probably head back to Vagastrom, I don't want to be seen going in and out of your dorm.” Alan hadn't even finished his sentence as he walked away from me and my dorm.

 

 “Alan, wait!” I chased after his quick long steps, with my short quick ones. 

 

 “Something wrong?” 

 

 “I thought I told you I don't care about what other people think.” 

 

 Alan stopped, turning to face me again. His fists were clenched and the veins in his arms popped. Was he angry with me? 

 

 “I care.”

 

 “Oh. . .”

 

 “It doesn't matter if I'm a ‘good’ guy in your eyes. A lot of people see me as a threat. I like spending time with you, but after seeing everyone's face when you claimed to be my girl. . .”

 

 “Alan, have you ever had a girlfriend before?” I felt shy asking him.

 

 “Not really. No.”

 

 “I'm sorry if I ruined your first experience. I get that you care as a friend, and you care about if you dampen my reputation. But honestly, I just feel kind of. . . Flattered. That I got to be your first girlfriend. Even if it was fake. Leo said he'd take care of the rumors, so I don't get why you're so mad.”

 

 “I'm mad because if I'm bad news, that means people will think you're bad news. Which means people stop caring about finding a solution to break your curse.”

 

 “You don't know for sure that would happen.”

 

 “I don't want to risk it.”

 

 We stood there for a moment. I moved closer to him, and he didn't move away. That was my in. I threw my arms around Alan. It was like holding a statue. He was still, and hard as stone. 

 

 “Helping me, shouldn't involve losing yourself. It's not dangerous to let me in, no more dangerous than a mission, or the Kyklos curse. Don't treat me like another risk. Treat me like your friend, if you care about me.” I buried my misty eyes into Alan.

 

 He was reliable, and strong. But he was also stubborn. Alan is convinced he's nothing more than his past. Nothing more than his biggest missteps. But I don't know where I would be without him. 

 

 I felt Alan's frame relax in my arms. I looked up at him, only to find he'd already been waiting to meet my eyes. I felt his hand on the top of my head, he patted me gently.

 

 “I can't let you get hurt. And I don't want you to be afraid of me. But for some reason, I think I can't have one without the other.”

 

 That's what this was? He's scared that if he protects me, I'll grow to fear him. But if he doesn't protect me, I could get hurt. Both scenarios involve him having the right amount of control over his strength. 

 

 “You're always gentle when you pat my head. And you held back enough today, that Liam walked away with a hairline fracture, instead of a shattered arm. I'm not afraid of you, and I'm not afraid to let you protect me either.”

 

 Alan smiled down at me. 

 

 “You're a great friend, and really good with words. Thank you for trying to know me.”

 

 With that, Alan apologized for his outburst and excused himself to his Captain duties in Vagastrom. I watched him walk away until he became a distant memory. Even then I wanted to stay outside. Just in case he looked back. 

 

 I want to know him more than I do, but if I do, will it hurt him more after I'm gone? Maybe he was right, maybe it's best to leave those you love out of it. But I can't seem to help it.

Something Was Trying to Get In on My Last Shift,"The warehouse was silent, save for the low hum of the monitors and the occasional deep creak in the walls, like the building itself was exhaling. I took another sip from my fifth cup of black coffee that evening, feeling the bitterness coat my tongue.

My eyelids were heavy, and I was just about to sink deeper into the swivel chair for a quick nap when my phone suddenly buzzed on the table, the sharp sound cutting through the quiet and jolting me upright.

It was a message from my brother, Jamie.

_Hey, you still up?_

I yawned and rubbed my eyes, the screen’s glare making them sting. My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a second before I typed back a quick reply: _Got the night shift again. What’s up?_

A few seconds passed as I stared at the blinking cursor, the soft buzz of the monitors filling the silence around me. The warehouse sat next to the only supermarket in town, a squat, grey building that most people barely noticed.

It wasn’t much to look at. Just rows of metal shelves stacked with boxes of cereal, bottled drinks, cleaning supplies, and whatever else the supermarket didn’t have room for out front. I’d been working there for about a year and a half, mostly during the night shift.

It wasn’t the most exciting job, but it paid the bills, and I didn’t have to deal with customers or chatter. Just me, the shelves, and the occasional rats that scurried behind the pallets.

During the day, the place was busy. Workers hauling boxes in and out, checking inventory, logging deliveries, and preparing shipments for the store floor. But at night, things slowed to a crawl.

The supermarket closed at ten, and once the last delivery truck was gone, the silence would set in. My job was mostly to keep an eye on the CCTV feeds, make sure no one tried to sneak in through the loading docks, and double-check that the power systems and refrigeration units were running properly.

Every couple of hours, I’d do a walk around the aisles, flashlight in hand, just to make sure nothing had fallen or leaked. Most nights were uneventful, long stretches of stillness broken only by the hum of the lights and the echo of my own footsteps.

ACCESS DENIED.

The mechanical woman’s voice from the entrance panel broke the silence, sharp and metallic, echoing faintly through the rows of shelves. I froze for a second. The sound bounced off the concrete walls in an oddly muffled way, like it didn’t belong there. I frowned and clicked to switch the front entrance camera to full screen.

Empty.

The loading bay outside looked the same as always. A stretch of bare concrete under harsh white lights, the security gate locked tight. Beyond that, the trees along the access road swayed gently in the wind, their shadows crawling across the pavement.

Nothing moved. No cars, no people, not even the usual stray cat that sometimes wandered near the dumpsters. Still, something about the silence felt heavier than before, as if the warehouse was holding its breath.

I shrugged and took another sip of my coffee. Probably just another glitch. The system acted up every now and then. Sometimes the sensor wouldn’t recognize your fingerprint at all no matter how many times you pressed your thumb against it. You’d have to wipe it clean, press again, curse a little, and hope it finally decided to cooperate.

During the day, the roll-up gate usually stayed open, with employees coming and going as they loaded stock or moved deliveries to the store. But at night, it was different. 

Once the last truck left and the supermarket lights went out, the gate came down and locked tight. After that, the only way in was through the small metal door, which could only be opened using the fingerprint panel.

I pulled the office door open and walked over to the rusty metal railing, leaning forward to peer down into the darkness below.

“Hello?”

My voice echoed through the warehouse, thin and warped, distorted in a way that made it sound wrong. Almost unfamiliar. I frowned, but brushed it off. The building was old anyway. Old buildings creaked, groaned, and did weird things all the time.

I turned back toward the door, grabbed the handle and pushed. It didn’t move. I tried again, lifting it slightly before shoving harder. Nothing. Still stuck. Fuck. First the fingerprint scanner, now this. I muttered under my breath and jiggled the handle, irritation creeping into my chest as I put my weight against it. The door refused to budge.

I leaned closer and tapped my forehead lightly against the small rectangular glass window, once, then again and again, feeling really stupid. The glass was colder than I expected. 

I pulled back quickly, unsettled by a strange, fleeting thought that someone might be pressing back from the other side. I shook it off. What the hell? Maybe I’d have to jimmy it open

I took a deep breath and forced myself to calm down, then wrapped my hand around the handle again and twisted it sharply in one precise motion. Click. The door swung open. 

For just a second, I caught my reflection in the glass. It looked distorted, stretched wrong by the angle and the light. My face looked exhausted. Sad, somehow. Jesus. I really did need some time off work.

I flipped through the logbook lazily until I found the last entry. Grabbing a pen, I jotted down a quick note about the entrance panel glitch and the stupid door being stuck on a fresh page, just enough detail so the morning shift could pass it along to the IT department. No point making a big deal out of it. Stuff like this happened all the time.

Then I sat down and clicked through the monitors until I found the one showing the cold room readings. All the temperature indicators were still steady, glowing a faint green across the screen. Good. At least that part of the system was behaving tonight.

It was just one of those long, sleepy nights where time seemed to crawl. The hum of the refrigeration units filled the background like white noise, and the only thing keeping me awake was the caffeine still lingering in my veins. A few more hours, I told myself. Just hang on until morning comes then I can clock out, and head home.

I was just about to lean back and let myself relax for a bit when it started again.

ACCESS DENIED.

The robotic voice cut through the silence, echoing faintly through the aisles. It sounded distant this time, like it was coming from somewhere deep inside the building, or maybe just bouncing weirdly off the concrete walls.

“What the fuck…” I muttered, fumbling for the mouse. I clicked over to the entrance camera again. Still empty. Exactly like before.

I refreshed the feed a few times, watching the seconds tick in the corner of the screen just to make sure it was live. Nothing. The same stretch of pavement, the same still trees. Not a soul in sight.

A cold, prickling feeling crept up the back of my neck. I was about to stand up when my phone suddenly buzzed against the desk, the vibration loud in the quiet room. It skidded dangerously close to the edge before I snatched it up.

“Yes?” I answered lazily.

_“Hey, dipshit,”_ said my brother, his voice crackling through. _“Don’t fall asleep on me yet. Tell me you requested those days off.”_

“Nice to hear from you too. Actually… can you call me ba—”

_“Dude, come on. Oakenfell Forest tomorrow. Just like old times. I already picked up the tent and other stuff from that pricey camping rental place.”_

“Jesus, man, relax. Louie already signed off on my one-week leave yesterday.”

He let out a giddy laugh that was far too high-pitched for a grown man. My brother could be unbearable when he wanted something badly enough.

The truth was, I’d never been much of an outdoors person. Not like him. He thrived on dirt trails, campfires, and sleeping under open skies, while I preferred solid walls and a reliable mattress.

Still, when we were kids, our father used to drag us into the wilderness for a few nights at a time. We’d sleep beneath a sprawl of stars, far from the noise of town, wrapped in that deep, almost sacred silence you only find in the wilderness.

Then we grew up. Work schedules, bills, and adult obligations pulled us in different directions, and those small escapes into the wild slowly disappeared.

After Dad passed away a few years ago, my brother made me promise we’d keep the tradition alive, just the two of us, a few nights outdoors every now and then, in his honor. The problem was our lives rarely aligned. For months, he’d been nagging me to request time off so we could finally go camping again.

_“Did you ask your friend if you could borrow his camera?”_ he went on.

“Yes,” I replied, already losing patience. “I’ll swing by Jerry’s place later and pick it up on my way to yours. Happy now?”

_“You better,”_ he said. _“I’m not doing this hike solo again. You bail, I’m hiking Blue Hill and spreading your ashes in a deer’s poo.”_

“Relax. I wanna go. Seriously. I need to get outta here for a few days anyway. This place is like… weird.”

I could hear him yawn on the other end.

_“Bet it’s creepy as hell at night.”_

“It’s not that bad,” I said, glancing at the screens.”

_“You should bring a Ouija board. Summon some ghosts. Spice things up.”_

“Why are you so hell-bent on going there, anyway?” I asked.

He let out a small, excited chuckle.

_“Dad went camping in Oakenfell Forest once, said it was beautiful but he never went back. He wanted to, though.”_

I frowned, staring absently at the floor as a vague memory surfaced.

“Wait… did you say Oakenfell Forest? Isn’t that where a group of hikers went missing a few years ago?”

I turned to my computer. The screen glowed to life as my fingers hovered over the keyboard. I quickly typed ‘Oakenfell Forest Incident’ into the search bar and hit enter.

“Oh, this doesn’t sound good,” I muttered, scrolling through the results. “It says here they went missing under mysterious circumstances. Some of their backpacks, jackets, and shoes were found scattered around the cliffside.” 

_”Yeah yeah yeah. Creepy stuff.”_

I clicked on one of the articles and skimmed it.

“But strangely enough, none of them have ever been found. Dead or alive.” I leaned back in my chair, phone wedged between my shoulder and ear as I continued reading aloud. “Search parties, helicopters, the whole thing. Nothing. They just… vanished.”

My brother scoffed audibly.

_“People disappear under mysterious circumstances everywhere, every day. That doesn’t mean anything.”_

“We could be them,” I said grimly, only half joking.

_“Don’t be such a buzzkill, asshole.”_

“I’m serious,” I said, ignoring him as I clicked on the next article. The page took a moment to load, then filled with another wall of text and grainy photographs. “Those hikers weren’t the only ones.”

He let out an exaggerated groan through the phone. I could hear him chewing loudly on the other end.

“Are you eating right now?”

_“Chips,”_ he said. _“Continue your ghost story.”_

“Listen,” I insisted, leaning closer to the screen. “It says here there’s been a string of other creepy disappearances… Not just recently.”

_“Here we go.”_

I scrolled down, skimming through paragraphs of dates and names.

“Some of these cases go way back. Long before it even became an official camping site.”

A brief silence hung on the line.

_“You really know how to sell a vacation, you know that?”_ He said. _“You’ve been reading way too much Missing 411. That guy is a fra—”_

ACCESS DENIED.

_“—what was that?”_ Jamie asked.

“You heard that?” I asked, already on my feet, staring out at the dark aisles below.

_“Uh. Yeah.”_

I rubbed my forehead. “Someone tried to get in. Biometric reader went off. Probably a glitch. Hang on.”

My fingers trembled as I opened the system log. Same fingerprint attempt. No match.

_“Someone’s out there?”_ he asked.

“No,” I muttered quickly, eyes fixed on the feed. “Camera’s empty. No movement. It’s probably just acting up again.”

I didn’t entirely believe it, though. The voice still echoed faintly in my head, like it was coming from somewhere far inside the warehouse.

_“Maybe it’s a raccoon,”_ he joked. _“A very determined, very tech-savvy raccoon.”_

“Shut up.”

ACCESS DENIED.

_“Still happening?”_ Jamie asked, his voice tightening just a little.

“Yeah. Feels... off.”

I refreshed the feed. Nothing changed. Still no one at the entrance. No flicker. No movement. Just the sound of that damn voice.

_“Maybe someone forgot their ID or something,”_ Jamie said.

“Nobody’s supposed to be coming in this late,” I muttered, frowning at the timestamp in the corner of the screen. “And there’s nobody at the entrance. It’s fucking empty!”

_“What time is it?”_

“Almost two.”

There was a brief pause on the line.

_“Welp. That’s not unsettling at all.”_

I didn’t answer. The hum of the monitors suddenly felt louder, like the warehouse itself was listening.

I stood up and walked a slow circle around the office, trying to shake off the tension building in my shoulders. Through the glass walls, I could see the entire warehouse below. Rows and rows of shelves stacked high with boxes and crates, forming a maze of shadowy aisles that seemed to go on forever.

I reached over to the control panel and flipped on the overhead lights, one section at a time. With a low hum, the fluorescents flickered to life across the warehouse. First near the loading bay, then the cold storage area, then the aisles farther back. Bright white light flooded every corner. Nothing moved. No figures. No sound beyond the distant buzz of electricity.

I leaned closer to the glass, scanning the floor carefully, half expecting to see someone or something ducking behind a pallet. But there was nothing. Just the endless stillness of a space that suddenly felt too large and too empty.

_“Okay,”_ Jamie said. _“So if this turns into, like, some found footage horror… shit like that, what’s the protocol? You hide behind a forklift?”_

“If I died and turned into a ghost, I’d haunt you for the rest of your life,” I told him.

He snorted.

_“You’d probably still show up for work the next night… and haunt that place. Took me years to get you to take even a few days off.”_

“I’ll call you back, okay? I’m just gonna check it out.”

_“Be careful, dude.”_

I hung up, slipped the phone into my pocket, and pushed open the office door. The metal stairs groaned under my sneakers as I made my way down, each step echoing through the empty space.

I’d left only a few of the overhead lamps on, so most of the warehouse was swallowed in shadow. The cold room lights cast long, yellow rectangles across the floor, stretching my shadow out toward the rows of shelves and the far wall on my left.

The air was cool and still, the faint hum of the refrigeration units filling the silence. I moved between two tall shelving racks, the narrow aisle amplifying the sound of my footsteps. The place always felt different at night.

I thought back to the shift handover earlier that evening. No one had said a word about the damn door acting up. I was sure of it.

As soon as I reached the small gray door, I grabbed the handle and pulled it open. A cool rush of night air hit my face, carrying with it the hum of cicadas buzzing somewhere out in the dark.

I zipped my jacket all the way up to my chin and stepped outside. The heavy metal door creaked softly as it swung shut behind me.

The parking lot stretched out quiet and still, bathed in patches of weak yellow light from the overhead lamps. My car sat near the chain-link fence in front of the warehouse, half-hidden in shadow. The old delivery truck was parked in its usual spot, way off in the far corner, where the light barely reached.

Everything looked the same as it always did.

I turned my head toward the supermarket next door. The building loomed over the lot, a flat gray slab of concrete and glass. Now and then, a car passed on the main road beyond it, headlights sliding across the facade and stretching long shadows over the wall.

Nothing moved. No raccoons. No cats. No stray dogs nosing around the bins. Just the faint hum of the floodlights and the chorus of insects in the trees beyond the fence. The air smelled faintly of dust, rain-soaked asphalt, and something metallic drifting from the warehouse vents.

I rubbed the back of my neck, trying to shake off the tension crawling under my skin. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a cigarette. The first drag steadied me. The ember glowed faint orange against the dark, the smoke curling lazily up into the night.

Might as well have one, I thought. No way I was going back in there yet. Not until I checked what the fuck was wrong with that damned fingerprint scanner.

Everything seemed quiet and empty, yet I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Across the lot, the supermarket’s upper windows reflected the amber glow of the streetlamps. Empty, still, like a row of watchful eyes staring down at me.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out and glanced at the screen. Another text from Jamie.

_So?_

I thumbed back a quick reply: _Nothing. Just a glitch. Out for a quick smoke._

Sent it, shoved the phone back into my pocket, and took another long drag. The night stayed perfectly still. Only the faint hiss of the cigarette and the hum of the lights kept me company.

After a few minutes of staring at the deserted parking lot, I flicked my second cigarette onto the asphalt and watched the tiny ember roll a few inches before dying out. My fingers were starting to go numb from the cold. I told myself I’d stalled long enough.

I slipped the pack of cigarettes back into my pocket and started walking toward the door. The warehouse was dead silent except for the faint echo of my footsteps against the concrete. 

When I reached the small metal door, I frowned at the fingerprint scanner. The little monitor glowed its usual dull blue, flickering slightly like it was tired of doing its job.

I pressed my finger lightly against the sensor.

ACCESS DENIED

I tried again, this time a little firmer.

ACCESS DENIED

I sighed under my breath.

“Piece of junk.”

ACCESS DENIED

The thing probably just needed a little encouragement. Maybe a smack or two.

ACCESS DENIED

I rubbed the cuff of my jacket hard against the scanner, brushing away a faint smudge of dust, and tried again.

ACCESS DENIED.

I let out a long, frustrated sigh and dug into my pocket, pulling out a tissue and scrubbing at the scanner with more force than necessary, like it had personally wronged me. Then…

ACCESS GRANTED

A soft click. I grabbed the handle and pushed the door open. The hinges groaned like they hadn’t been used in years, sending a faint echo across the empty warehouse. I stepped through cautiously, scanning the dim space ahead, and double-checked the lock behind me. A quick tug on the handle reassured me it was secure.

With a deep breath, I squared my shoulders and started back across the warehouse floor, each step feeling heavier than the last. The air inside felt cooler.

The faint hum from the cold room in the distance was barely audible, but it was there. A reminder that the building wasn’t completely dead. I climbed the metal stairs and slipped back into the small office upstairs.

I sank back into my chair and glanced at the monitor. 2:30 a.m. Still a few hours to go. I sighed and fished out my phone, typing a quick message to my brother: _Still up, loser?_

I took a sip of my cold coffee, and out of habit, checked the cold room readings on the screen again for what had to be the tenth time tonight. Everything looked fine.

My phone buzzed.

_Barely. So was it a ghost?_

_You wish_, I typed back. _Told you, it was just the fingerprint scanner acting up again._

I yawned, set the phone down, and clicked on another browser tab. YouTube loaded up, and I scrolled until I found my favorite travel channel. Some guy hiking through frozen mountain passes somewhere in Norway. Might as well let someone else’s adventure keep me awake for a bit.

A few minutes later, my phone lit up on the desk.

_Disappointing. TTYL. Going to bed soon._

I turned the volume down a little and switched on the closed captions before leaning back into my chair. My eyelids felt heavy despite the ridiculous amount of coffee I’d had that night. Once or twice, I would check the entrance camera, see nothing, and sink back down.

ACCESS DENIED

This is getting really annoying now, I thought, rubbing my eyes. Somebody better fix that damned panel first thing in the morning.

At some point after three, I was jolted awake by a silence so deep it almost felt solid. For a second, I just sat there, blinking stupidly, disoriented and unsure of where I was. Then the faint hum of the fluorescent lights brought me back to reality. I exhaled, stretched, and reached for my coffee, its surface cold and oily under the dim glow of the monitor.

ACCESS GRANTED.

I set the coffee down too fast, sloshing what was left across the desk, and fumbled for the mouse. The monitor flickered as I clicked into the entrance camera feed. The parking lot outside stared back at me. Empty, still, the same blank stretch of concrete under the white security lights.

My pulse quickened. I switched to the camera mounted on the ceiling above the gate.

The door swung open. Very slowly.

A faint, metallic creak echoed through the warehouse. Distant but unmistakable, bouncing off the concrete walls. I sucked in a sharp breath, my skin prickling. The live feed showed nothing. No figure. No shadow. Just the door, wide open to empty air.

I shot up from my chair and reached for the control panel, flipping the switch to turn on every section of overhead lighting. My eyes darted toward the warehouse below through the office glass.

Nothing.

For some reason, most of the lights stayed off. A few weak fluorescents flickered to life, casting long, trembling shadows across the aisles. The rest of the vast space remained drowned in dim yellow gloom.

Fuck.

I hesitated, then stepped out of the office and onto the top of the metal stairs. The iron groaned beneath my shoes as I looked down at the endless rows of shelves leading all the way to the entrance.

“Who’s there?” I called out, my voice rough, still half-asleep and shaking slightly.

Silence.

The kind that felt like it was listening back.

“Hello?” My voice sounded small against the vast, hollow space.

I went back into the office and yanked open the bottom drawer, pulling out the old flashlight we kept there for power outages. Its beam flickered weakly as I clicked it on, a dull yellow cone of light cutting through the dim warehouse gloom.

I swept it slowly across the shelves, the beam catching glints of shrink wrap, cardboard edges, metal rails, each one throwing strange, stretched-out shadows that seemed to move when I did.

But still nothing.

I drew a deep breath, ready to call out again, when a sound tore through the silence.

Footsteps.

Slow, deliberate footsteps coming from the far end of the aisle directly in front of the stairs.

I froze, my hand tightening around the flashlight. The beam wavered as I pointed it down the narrow corridor of shelves, swinging it back and forth. Nothing. Just empty space.

“Who’s there?” I called out again, my voice cracking somewhere between fear and exhaustion.

The footsteps grew faster. Closer. Echoing sharply against the concrete floor. My stomach turned cold. I stepped back without meaning to, eyes locked on the end of the aisle where the sound was coming from, waiting for something, anything, to appear.

Then, suddenly, the pace changed again. The footsteps broke into a sprint. Heavy, fast, pounding toward me.

“Shit!”

The noise slammed into the stairwell. Each metal step groaned and clanged under invisible weight, one after another, climbing. Closer and closer.

I dropped the flashlight. It hit the stairs with a harsh metallic clang and tumbled away, its beam spinning wildly before going dark.

Before I even realized what I was doing, I was already stumbling backward into the office. The door slammed shut with a metallic thud that echoed through the room, louder than I meant it to. My hands fumbled with the lock until it clicked into place.

I stood there for a second, chest heaving, trying to listen over the rush of blood in my ears. Then instinct took over. I backed away fast, nearly tripping over the chair, and pressed myself against the far wall. The cold plaster met my spine as I slid down, breath shallow and uneven, every muscle tensed.

For a moment, I didn’t dare move. It felt like the whole warehouse was listening, the air thick and heavy, holding its breath along with me.

My eyes stayed locked on the small rectangular glass pane set into the door. Every muscle in my body felt wired, tight with a mix of terror and raw anticipation. Whoever, or whatever had been climbing those stairs had to be standing just outside the office now. I could almost feel it on the other side, the way the air seemed to thicken and press inward. 

But when I forced myself to look, I saw nothing through the glass. Just the dim, empty stretch of the metal walkway outside, its surface catching the weak light from the overhead lamps.

I stood and took a few hesitant steps toward the door. My pulse thudded in my ears. I squinted through the narrow glass pane, scanning the dim corridor beyond. Nothing. The walkway lay empty, silent, and still as before.

My eyes flicked toward the computer screen on the desk. The wall of camera feeds flickered faintly. Rows of small blue-tinted images showing every corner of the warehouse. I leaned closer, my gaze sweeping over them one by one until it landed on the feed from the camera mounted just outside the office.

For a moment, I couldn’t process what I was seeing. The image showed the top of the stairs, the metal walkway, and the office door. This door. And something else. A shape. A figure standing perfectly still right in front of it.

My mouth went dry. I frowned, blinking hard, leaning in until my face was inches from the monitor. The outline was unmistakable: tall, motionless, human-shaped, but far too dark to be lit by the overhead lamps.

I cranked up the screen brightness and realized it was, in fact, a person. A man. He stood just beyond the office door, motionless beneath the dim exterior light. A gray parka hung loosely from his frame, the fabric torn in several places as though it had been snagged on branches or dragged across rough ground.

Dried mud caked his army pants, the dark, uneven stains streaking down the legs. Across the front of his jacket, blotches of something darker spread in irregular patches, soaking into the fabric in a way that made my stomach tighten.

There was something deeply wrong with his posture. One shoulder sagged noticeably lower than the other, causing his body to tilt at an unnatural angle. The corresponding arm bent inward across his stomach, twisted in a way no joint should allow. 

His head leaned forward and slightly to the side, as though it had been severed and clumsily set back in place without regard for alignment. Even his right leg jutted outward, crooked and unsteady, forcing his stance into a grotesque, off-balance shape.

His face appeared smeared with mud and what I guessed might have been blood, but the harsh overhead light behind him cast it in shadow on the monitor. From that angle, I couldn’t make out his features clearly.

I tore my eyes from the screen and looked back toward the door. Nothing. Just the faint reflection of my own pale face in the glass. Heart hammering, I turned back to the monitor. The figure hadn’t moved, but now it was closer, his head tilted downward, pressed against the glass pane as if trying to peer inside, his arms hung limply at its sides.

He was staring right at me.

Immediately I recoiled from the door, my eyes locked onto the little glass pane until my back hit the cold wall. Slowly, like I didn’t want to make a sound, I slid down into a crouch on the floor.

The metal handle began to jiggle, dipping down and then popping back up, each motion ending with a loud, metallic snap that made my heart slam against my ribs.

And then I heard it. A low, rasping cry seeped through the metal door. So faint and so full of pain that it made my chest tighten. It sounded like someone trying to speak through a crushed throat, each syllable dragged out with agonizing effort.

_“Hhheeeeeelpppp…”_

Every hair on my arms shot up at once. I grabbed the rolling office chair beside the desk and yanked it toward me, the wheels squealing softly across the floor. With trembling hands, I turned it so the back faced the door and shoved it against the frame like a poor-man’s barricade.

_“Yyyooouuuursss…”_

The word slithered through the thin gap beneath the door. I swallowed hard, my throat dry and tight. For a moment there was only silence. Heavy and suffocating. Then the voice returned, thinner this time. More strained. As if whatever stood outside had to force each sound through a ruined mouth.

_“Dddoooonnnttttttt…”_

The handle moved again, over and over… down, up, down, up… each time harder, each time with that same ugly snap, as if something on the other side were testing whether the door would give.

Thank God it didn’t. The bolt held. The door stayed shut and locked. I wrapped both hands around the armrests of the chair until my knuckles ached, every muscle ready to fling it at the door if it came to that. My breathing came in shallow, fast bursts.

I took a deep breath and snapped my head toward the computer screen just as a dull, heavy thud rattled through the room. My pulse surged. On the monitor, the figure was still there.

Right outside the door, its body rocking in a slow, unnatural rhythm. Then he lunged forward and slammed his head against the metal surface.

Thud.

The sound vibrated through the floor, sharp and metallic. I could almost feel it in my teeth.

Thud.

Again. Harder this time. The whole door trembled in its frame.

Thud.

Each impact came heavier than the last, his movements twitchy and desperate, like he wanted in. No matter how.

I crossed my arms tightly over my chest, bracing for whatever was about to break through that door, and squeezed my eyes shut. Every muscle in my body trembled as the pounding continued. Slow, steady, and maddening. I lost track of time crouched there on the cold floor, my back pressed hard against the wall, listening to the sound fade, then return, then fade again.

Eventually, exhaustion crept in. My body felt too heavy to move, and despite the fear still crawling under my skin, sleep dragged me under like a wave.

When I came to, there was a sound I didn’t register right away. Soft, rhythmic knocking. My eyes snapped open. For a second, I couldn’t remember where I was. The fluorescent lights hummed faintly overhead, and the monitors showed nothing but the usual static feeds of an empty warehouse.

I turned toward the door. A familiar face pressed against the glass pane, frowning, caught somewhere between confusion and anger. My stomach tightened. I scrambled to my feet, blinking hard, realizing how stiff my legs were from sleeping on the floor. My voice came out cracked and dry.

“Louie?”

He gestured impatiently for me to unlock the door.

“What the hell, man?” Louie barked the second I unlocked the door. He shoved it open, stepping inside with that half-angry, half-worried look he always got when something didn’t make sense.

His eyes darted around the office. The spilled coffee on the desk, the half-empty mug on the floor, the chair knocked slightly off-center. Then his gaze landed back on me.

“Uh, sorry. I fell asleep,” I muttered nervously.

“Were you drinking or something?” He looked me up and down, frowning.

“What? No! Of course not!” I shot back, rubbing the back of my neck.

“Why was the front door open?” he demanded, his voice rising. “I thought someone broke in. Scared the shit outta me when I saw it unlocked.”

I didn’t answer. My mind was still foggy, my heart pounding from the adrenaline spike. Instead, I stepped up to the office windows and leaned forward, scanning the aisles and long rows of shelves below.

Shadows stretched between the stacks, shifting slightly under the dim fluorescent lights, but everything looked empty.

I stepped back toward the desk, careful not to step in the sticky puddle of spilled coffee. My hands trembled slightly as I grabbed the mouse and pulled up the security footage from the night before. Clicking through the timestamps, my stomach sank as I watched the events unfold.

Nothing at first. The feeds were clean. Every camera angle looked perfectly normal. The parking lot, the aisles, the stairs. No figure. No movement. Nothing but the quiet, empty warehouse.

I checked the footage from the entrance camera first. The timestamp ran between one and three in the morning. There I was, walking out the front door, lighting a cigarette, pacing nervously across the empty parking lot.

A few minutes later, I returned to the small metal door and leaned down to check the fingerprint scanner. Everything matched what I remembered. Nothing seemed out of place.

Then I switched to the camera mounted inside the warehouse, right in front of the gate. That’s when my stomach dropped. The door, still closed, suddenly swung open. I froze, my hands gripping the edge of the desk.

Heart hammering, I clicked over to the camera near the top of the stairs. On-screen, I could see myself standing at the top, flashlight in hand, the weak beam slicing across the aisle below. My body froze, staring down toward the entrance like I’d just witnessed something impossible.

Then, without warning, I spun and bolted back into the office, disappearing out of frame. The flashlight slipped from my grip as I lunged for the door.

Seeing it all from multiple angles made it undeniable. Something had been out there, something I hadn’t been able to see with my own eyes. And it was closer than I ever wanted to imagine.

“What the hell was all that about?” Louie asked calmly from right behind me, arms crossed over his chest, his eyebrows raised.

“I…” I stammered, my throat dry. “The door security system… It's been acting up all night. The fingerprint scanner kept showing someone was trying to get in…”

I rubbed my face with both hands and let out a long, shaky sigh, trying to steady my racing heartbeat.

“And?” Louie pressed, leaning slightly forward. “Was anyone actually trying to get in?”

“No. As you can see for yourself. The door… it just opened by itself at one point. Probably a glitch.” I gestured toward the old leather-bound logbook sitting next to the keyboard. “I wrote everything down in the log for the morning shift.”

Louie shoved me lightly aside and started scrolling through the recorded footage from all the cameras. His eyes narrowed as he paused on the clip of me at the top of the stairs, flashlight beam cutting across the rows of shelves.

“What the hell happened here?” he asked, his voice quieter now, almost cautious.

“I…” My chest tightened, and I could feel my heart hammering in my ears as I tried to relive it. “… nothing.”

That was partly true. Nothing should have been out there. Nothing should have opened the door or triggered the scanner. And that was exactly what had terrified me.

“I should get going,” I finally said, my voice tight and a little unsteady. I bent over to grab some tissues and carefully wiped at the sticky mess I’d left on the desk and the floor.

Louie watched me, frowning.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

“I haven’t slept well, and my head is still spinning,” I added quickly, tossing the crumpled tissue into the trash bin next to the desk.

“So, you’re taking the week off starting today, right?” he asked again, picking up the logbook, eyes still on me, studying every move.

I just nodded, weakly.

“I’m not gonna write you a suspension this time for leaving the front door wide open all night,” he continued.

“But I did n—”

He held up a hand firmly. I swallowed my protest.

“That’s a huge no-no. If management finds out, you’ll be suspended immediately.”

I nodded again, gritting my teeth.

“Enjoy your time off. And make sure you’re back at work…” He glanced at the printed schedule pinned to the wall beside the computer. “…Friday night, next week.”

“I will,” I said, grabbing my small sling bag from the desk.

“And do me a favor, please.” His voice dropped a little, the tension in his expression easing. “Help yourself and get some rest. You look like crap. And try not to fall asleep on the job again… if you plan on keeping it. In this economy, you don’t want to stay unemployed for too long.”

Without another word, I walked out of the office. My body felt stiff and uncooperative, like it wasn’t entirely mine. My shoulder ached, my neck throbbed, and one leg dragged behind the others. I told myself it was just exhaustion.

After clocking out in a hurry, I started walking toward my car in the parking lot. The sun was already up, but thick clouds dulled the light, washing everything in a cold, gray-blue haze.

A low fog clung to the ground, and the morning air bit through my jacket as I crossed the lot. I could see dark storm clouds gathering in the distance.

I was about halfway to my car when something dark on the asphalt caught my eye.

At first, I thought it was just a damp patch, but then I noticed the shape. An uneven impression, smeared at the edges, like a shoe pressed through mud and left behind. There were a few more nearby, shallow and incomplete, fading as they crossed the lot.

One of them sat wrong, turned slightly outward, as if whoever had made it hadn’t been walking straight. My stomach tightened as I followed the marks with my eyes. They led toward the warehouse entrance, stopping right in front of the door.

Frowning, I traced the trail the other way. The prints grew darker, muddier, and sharper as I went, until they ended right beside my car. At the driver’s side door.

For a moment, I just stood there, the cold seeping through my shoes, a strange pressure settling in my chest.

I had the sudden, irrational urge to turn around, to go back inside and tell Louie exactly what had happened, what I had seen, and how it had terrified me.

But my phone buzzed in my pocket. I winced as I pulled it out. It was a text from my brother, asking if I was ready to hit the road to Oakenfell Forest. I thumbed a short reply, slid into the driver’s seat, and started the engine. I never looked back.",1,1770433924.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False

Something Was Trying to Get In on My Last Shift,"The warehouse was silent, save for the low hum of the monitors and the occasional deep creak in the walls, like the building itself was exhaling. I took another sip from my fifth cup of black coffee that evening, feeling the bitterness coat my tongue.

My eyelids were heavy, and I was just about to sink deeper into the swivel chair for a quick nap when my phone suddenly buzzed on the table, the sharp sound cutting through the quiet and jolting me upright.

It was a message from my brother, Jamie.

_Hey, you still up?_

I yawned and rubbed my eyes, the screen’s glare making them sting. My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a second before I typed back a quick reply: _Got the night shift again. What’s up?_

A few seconds passed as I stared at the blinking cursor, the soft buzz of the monitors filling the silence around me. The warehouse sat next to the only supermarket in town, a squat, grey building that most people barely noticed.

It wasn’t much to look at. Just rows of metal shelves stacked with boxes of cereal, bottled drinks, cleaning supplies, and whatever else the supermarket didn’t have room for out front. I’d been working there for about a year and a half, mostly during the night shift.

It wasn’t the most exciting job, but it paid the bills, and I didn’t have to deal with customers or chatter. Just me, the shelves, and the occasional rats that scurried behind the pallets.

During the day, the place was busy. Workers hauling boxes in and out, checking inventory, logging deliveries, and preparing shipments for the store floor. But at night, things slowed to a crawl.

The supermarket closed at ten, and once the last delivery truck was gone, the silence would set in. My job was mostly to keep an eye on the CCTV feeds, make sure no one tried to sneak in through the loading docks, and double-check that the power systems and refrigeration units were running properly.

Every couple of hours, I’d do a walk around the aisles, flashlight in hand, just to make sure nothing had fallen or leaked. Most nights were uneventful, long stretches of stillness broken only by the hum of the lights and the echo of my own footsteps.

ACCESS DENIED.

The mechanical woman’s voice from the entrance panel broke the silence, sharp and metallic, echoing faintly through the rows of shelves. I froze for a second. The sound bounced off the concrete walls in an oddly muffled way, like it didn’t belong there. I frowned and clicked to switch the front entrance camera to full screen.

Empty.

The loading bay outside looked the same as always. A stretch of bare concrete under harsh white lights, the security gate locked tight. Beyond that, the trees along the access road swayed gently in the wind, their shadows crawling across the pavement.

Nothing moved. No cars, no people, not even the usual stray cat that sometimes wandered near the dumpsters. Still, something about the silence felt heavier than before, as if the warehouse was holding its breath.

I shrugged and took another sip of my coffee. Probably just another glitch. The system acted up every now and then. Sometimes the sensor wouldn’t recognize your fingerprint at all no matter how many times you pressed your thumb against it. You’d have to wipe it clean, press again, curse a little, and hope it finally decided to cooperate.

During the day, the roll-up gate usually stayed open, with employees coming and going as they loaded stock or moved deliveries to the store. But at night, it was different. 

Once the last truck left and the supermarket lights went out, the gate came down and locked tight. After that, the only way in was through the small metal door, which could only be opened using the fingerprint panel.

I pulled the office door open and walked over to the rusty metal railing, leaning forward to peer down into the darkness below.

“Hello?”

My voice echoed through the warehouse, thin and warped, distorted in a way that made it sound wrong. Almost unfamiliar. I frowned, but brushed it off. The building was old anyway. Old buildings creaked, groaned, and did weird things all the time.

I turned back toward the door, grabbed the handle and pushed. It didn’t move. I tried again, lifting it slightly before shoving harder. Nothing. Still stuck. Fuck. First the fingerprint scanner, now this. I muttered under my breath and jiggled the handle, irritation creeping into my chest as I put my weight against it. The door refused to budge.

I leaned closer and tapped my forehead lightly against the small rectangular glass window, once, then again and again, feeling really stupid. The glass was colder than I expected. 

I pulled back quickly, unsettled by a strange, fleeting thought that someone might be pressing back from the other side. I shook it off. What the hell? Maybe I’d have to jimmy it open

I took a deep breath and forced myself to calm down, then wrapped my hand around the handle again and twisted it sharply in one precise motion. Click. The door swung open. 

For just a second, I caught my reflection in the glass. It looked distorted, stretched wrong by the angle and the light. My face looked exhausted. Sad, somehow. Jesus. I really did need some time off work.

I flipped through the logbook lazily until I found the last entry. Grabbing a pen, I jotted down a quick note about the entrance panel glitch and the stupid door being stuck on a fresh page, just enough detail so the morning shift could pass it along to the IT department. No point making a big deal out of it. Stuff like this happened all the time.

Then I sat down and clicked through the monitors until I found the one showing the cold room readings. All the temperature indicators were still steady, glowing a faint green across the screen. Good. At least that part of the system was behaving tonight.

It was just one of those long, sleepy nights where time seemed to crawl. The hum of the refrigeration units filled the background like white noise, and the only thing keeping me awake was the caffeine still lingering in my veins. A few more hours, I told myself. Just hang on until morning comes then I can clock out, and head home.

I was just about to lean back and let myself relax for a bit when it started again.

ACCESS DENIED.

The robotic voice cut through the silence, echoing faintly through the aisles. It sounded distant this time, like it was coming from somewhere deep inside the building, or maybe just bouncing weirdly off the concrete walls.

“What the fuck…” I muttered, fumbling for the mouse. I clicked over to the entrance camera again. Still empty. Exactly like before.

I refreshed the feed a few times, watching the seconds tick in the corner of the screen just to make sure it was live. Nothing. The same stretch of pavement, the same still trees. Not a soul in sight.

A cold, prickling feeling crept up the back of my neck. I was about to stand up when my phone suddenly buzzed against the desk, the vibration loud in the quiet room. It skidded dangerously close to the edge before I snatched it up.

“Yes?” I answered lazily.

_“Hey, dipshit,”_ said my brother, his voice crackling through. _“Don’t fall asleep on me yet. Tell me you requested those days off.”_

“Nice to hear from you too. Actually… can you call me ba—”

_“Dude, come on. Oakenfell Forest tomorrow. Just like old times. I already picked up the tent and other stuff from that pricey camping rental place.”_

“Jesus, man, relax. Louie already signed off on my one-week leave yesterday.”

He let out a giddy laugh that was far too high-pitched for a grown man. My brother could be unbearable when he wanted something badly enough.

The truth was, I’d never been much of an outdoors person. Not like him. He thrived on dirt trails, campfires, and sleeping under open skies, while I preferred solid walls and a reliable mattress.

Still, when we were kids, our father used to drag us into the wilderness for a few nights at a time. We’d sleep beneath a sprawl of stars, far from the noise of town, wrapped in that deep, almost sacred silence you only find in the wilderness.

Then we grew up. Work schedules, bills, and adult obligations pulled us in different directions, and those small escapes into the wild slowly disappeared.

After Dad passed away a few years ago, my brother made me promise we’d keep the tradition alive, just the two of us, a few nights outdoors every now and then, in his honor. The problem was our lives rarely aligned. For months, he’d been nagging me to request time off so we could finally go camping again.

_“Did you ask your friend if you could borrow his camera?”_ he went on.

“Yes,” I replied, already losing patience. “I’ll swing by Jerry’s place later and pick it up on my way to yours. Happy now?”

_“You better,”_ he said. _“I’m not doing this hike solo again. You bail, I’m hiking Blue Hill and spreading your ashes in a deer’s poo.”_

“Relax. I wanna go. Seriously. I need to get outta here for a few days anyway. This place is like… weird.”

I could hear him yawn on the other end.

_“Bet it’s creepy as hell at night.”_

“It’s not that bad,” I said, glancing at the screens.”

_“You should bring a Ouija board. Summon some ghosts. Spice things up.”_

“Why are you so hell-bent on going there, anyway?” I asked.

He let out a small, excited chuckle.

_“Dad went camping in Oakenfell Forest once, said it was beautiful but he never went back. He wanted to, though.”_

I frowned, staring absently at the floor as a vague memory surfaced.

“Wait… did you say Oakenfell Forest? Isn’t that where a group of hikers went missing a few years ago?”

I turned to my computer. The screen glowed to life as my fingers hovered over the keyboard. I quickly typed ‘Oakenfell Forest Incident’ into the search bar and hit enter.

“Oh, this doesn’t sound good,” I muttered, scrolling through the results. “It says here they went missing under mysterious circumstances. Some of their backpacks, jackets, and shoes were found scattered around the cliffside.” 

_”Yeah yeah yeah. Creepy stuff.”_

I clicked on one of the articles and skimmed it.

“But strangely enough, none of them have ever been found. Dead or alive.” I leaned back in my chair, phone wedged between my shoulder and ear as I continued reading aloud. “Search parties, helicopters, the whole thing. Nothing. They just… vanished.”

My brother scoffed audibly.

_“People disappear under mysterious circumstances everywhere, every day. That doesn’t mean anything.”_

“We could be them,” I said grimly, only half joking.

_“Don’t be such a buzzkill, asshole.”_

“I’m serious,” I said, ignoring him as I clicked on the next article. The page took a moment to load, then filled with another wall of text and grainy photographs. “Those hikers weren’t the only ones.”

He let out an exaggerated groan through the phone. I could hear him chewing loudly on the other end.

“Are you eating right now?”

_“Chips,”_ he said. _“Continue your ghost story.”_

“Listen,” I insisted, leaning closer to the screen. “It says here there’s been a string of other creepy disappearances… Not just recently.”

_“Here we go.”_

I scrolled down, skimming through paragraphs of dates and names.

“Some of these cases go way back. Long before it even became an official camping site.”

A brief silence hung on the line.

_“You really know how to sell a vacation, you know that?”_ He said. _“You’ve been reading way too much Missing 411. That guy is a fra—”_

ACCESS DENIED.

_“—what was that?”_ Jamie asked.

“You heard that?” I asked, already on my feet, staring out at the dark aisles below.

_“Uh. Yeah.”_

I rubbed my forehead. “Someone tried to get in. Biometric reader went off. Probably a glitch. Hang on.”

My fingers trembled as I opened the system log. Same fingerprint attempt. No match.

_“Someone’s out there?”_ he asked.

“No,” I muttered quickly, eyes fixed on the feed. “Camera’s empty. No movement. It’s probably just acting up again.”

I didn’t entirely believe it, though. The voice still echoed faintly in my head, like it was coming from somewhere far inside the warehouse.

_“Maybe it’s a raccoon,”_ he joked. _“A very determined, very tech-savvy raccoon.”_

“Shut up.”

ACCESS DENIED.

_“Still happening?”_ Jamie asked, his voice tightening just a little.

“Yeah. Feels... off.”

I refreshed the feed. Nothing changed. Still no one at the entrance. No flicker. No movement. Just the sound of that damn voice.

_“Maybe someone forgot their ID or something,”_ Jamie said.

“Nobody’s supposed to be coming in this late,” I muttered, frowning at the timestamp in the corner of the screen. “And there’s nobody at the entrance. It’s fucking empty!”

_“What time is it?”_

“Almost two.”

There was a brief pause on the line.

_“Welp. That’s not unsettling at all.”_

I didn’t answer. The hum of the monitors suddenly felt louder, like the warehouse itself was listening.

I stood up and walked a slow circle around the office, trying to shake off the tension building in my shoulders. Through the glass walls, I could see the entire warehouse below. Rows and rows of shelves stacked high with boxes and crates, forming a maze of shadowy aisles that seemed to go on forever.

I reached over to the control panel and flipped on the overhead lights, one section at a time. With a low hum, the fluorescents flickered to life across the warehouse. First near the loading bay, then the cold storage area, then the aisles farther back. Bright white light flooded every corner. Nothing moved. No figures. No sound beyond the distant buzz of electricity.

I leaned closer to the glass, scanning the floor carefully, half expecting to see someone or something ducking behind a pallet. But there was nothing. Just the endless stillness of a space that suddenly felt too large and too empty.

_“Okay,”_ Jamie said. _“So if this turns into, like, some found footage horror… shit like that, what’s the protocol? You hide behind a forklift?”_

“If I died and turned into a ghost, I’d haunt you for the rest of your life,” I told him.

He snorted.

_“You’d probably still show up for work the next night… and haunt that place. Took me years to get you to take even a few days off.”_

“I’ll call you back, okay? I’m just gonna check it out.”

_“Be careful, dude.”_

I hung up, slipped the phone into my pocket, and pushed open the office door. The metal stairs groaned under my sneakers as I made my way down, each step echoing through the empty space.

I’d left only a few of the overhead lamps on, so most of the warehouse was swallowed in shadow. The cold room lights cast long, yellow rectangles across the floor, stretching my shadow out toward the rows of shelves and the far wall on my left.

The air was cool and still, the faint hum of the refrigeration units filling the silence. I moved between two tall shelving racks, the narrow aisle amplifying the sound of my footsteps. The place always felt different at night.

I thought back to the shift handover earlier that evening. No one had said a word about the damn door acting up. I was sure of it.

As soon as I reached the small gray door, I grabbed the handle and pulled it open. A cool rush of night air hit my face, carrying with it the hum of cicadas buzzing somewhere out in the dark.

I zipped my jacket all the way up to my chin and stepped outside. The heavy metal door creaked softly as it swung shut behind me.

The parking lot stretched out quiet and still, bathed in patches of weak yellow light from the overhead lamps. My car sat near the chain-link fence in front of the warehouse, half-hidden in shadow. The old delivery truck was parked in its usual spot, way off in the far corner, where the light barely reached.

Everything looked the same as it always did.

I turned my head toward the supermarket next door. The building loomed over the lot, a flat gray slab of concrete and glass. Now and then, a car passed on the main road beyond it, headlights sliding across the facade and stretching long shadows over the wall.

Nothing moved. No raccoons. No cats. No stray dogs nosing around the bins. Just the faint hum of the floodlights and the chorus of insects in the trees beyond the fence. The air smelled faintly of dust, rain-soaked asphalt, and something metallic drifting from the warehouse vents.

I rubbed the back of my neck, trying to shake off the tension crawling under my skin. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a cigarette. The first drag steadied me. The ember glowed faint orange against the dark, the smoke curling lazily up into the night.

Might as well have one, I thought. No way I was going back in there yet. Not until I checked what the fuck was wrong with that damned fingerprint scanner.

Everything seemed quiet and empty, yet I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Across the lot, the supermarket’s upper windows reflected the amber glow of the streetlamps. Empty, still, like a row of watchful eyes staring down at me.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out and glanced at the screen. Another text from Jamie.

_So?_

I thumbed back a quick reply: _Nothing. Just a glitch. Out for a quick smoke._

Sent it, shoved the phone back into my pocket, and took another long drag. The night stayed perfectly still. Only the faint hiss of the cigarette and the hum of the lights kept me company.

After a few minutes of staring at the deserted parking lot, I flicked my second cigarette onto the asphalt and watched the tiny ember roll a few inches before dying out. My fingers were starting to go numb from the cold. I told myself I’d stalled long enough.

I slipped the pack of cigarettes back into my pocket and started walking toward the door. The warehouse was dead silent except for the faint echo of my footsteps against the concrete. 

When I reached the small metal door, I frowned at the fingerprint scanner. The little monitor glowed its usual dull blue, flickering slightly like it was tired of doing its job.

I pressed my finger lightly against the sensor.

ACCESS DENIED

I tried again, this time a little firmer.

ACCESS DENIED

I sighed under my breath.

“Piece of junk.”

ACCESS DENIED

The thing probably just needed a little encouragement. Maybe a smack or two.

ACCESS DENIED

I rubbed the cuff of my jacket hard against the scanner, brushing away a faint smudge of dust, and tried again.

ACCESS DENIED.

I let out a long, frustrated sigh and dug into my pocket, pulling out a tissue and scrubbing at the scanner with more force than necessary, like it had personally wronged me. Then…

ACCESS GRANTED

A soft click. I grabbed the handle and pushed the door open. The hinges groaned like they hadn’t been used in years, sending a faint echo across the empty warehouse. I stepped through cautiously, scanning the dim space ahead, and double-checked the lock behind me. A quick tug on the handle reassured me it was secure.

With a deep breath, I squared my shoulders and started back across the warehouse floor, each step feeling heavier than the last. The air inside felt cooler.

The faint hum from the cold room in the distance was barely audible, but it was there. A reminder that the building wasn’t completely dead. I climbed the metal stairs and slipped back into the small office upstairs.

I sank back into my chair and glanced at the monitor. 2:30 a.m. Still a few hours to go. I sighed and fished out my phone, typing a quick message to my brother: _Still up, loser?_

I took a sip of my cold coffee, and out of habit, checked the cold room readings on the screen again for what had to be the tenth time tonight. Everything looked fine.

My phone buzzed.

_Barely. So was it a ghost?_

_You wish_, I typed back. _Told you, it was just the fingerprint scanner acting up again._

I yawned, set the phone down, and clicked on another browser tab. YouTube loaded up, and I scrolled until I found my favorite travel channel. Some guy hiking through frozen mountain passes somewhere in Norway. Might as well let someone else’s adventure keep me awake for a bit.

A few minutes later, my phone lit up on the desk.

_Disappointing. TTYL. Going to bed soon._

I turned the volume down a little and switched on the closed captions before leaning back into my chair. My eyelids felt heavy despite the ridiculous amount of coffee I’d had that night. Once or twice, I would check the entrance camera, see nothing, and sink back down.

ACCESS DENIED

This is getting really annoying now, I thought, rubbing my eyes. Somebody better fix that damned panel first thing in the morning.

At some point after three, I was jolted awake by a silence so deep it almost felt solid. For a second, I just sat there, blinking stupidly, disoriented and unsure of where I was. Then the faint hum of the fluorescent lights brought me back to reality. I exhaled, stretched, and reached for my coffee, its surface cold and oily under the dim glow of the monitor.

ACCESS GRANTED.

I set the coffee down too fast, sloshing what was left across the desk, and fumbled for the mouse. The monitor flickered as I clicked into the entrance camera feed. The parking lot outside stared back at me. Empty, still, the same blank stretch of concrete under the white security lights.

My pulse quickened. I switched to the camera mounted on the ceiling above the gate.

The door swung open. Very slowly.

A faint, metallic creak echoed through the warehouse. Distant but unmistakable, bouncing off the concrete walls. I sucked in a sharp breath, my skin prickling. The live feed showed nothing. No figure. No shadow. Just the door, wide open to empty air.

I shot up from my chair and reached for the control panel, flipping the switch to turn on every section of overhead lighting. My eyes darted toward the warehouse below through the office glass.

Nothing.

For some reason, most of the lights stayed off. A few weak fluorescents flickered to life, casting long, trembling shadows across the aisles. The rest of the vast space remained drowned in dim yellow gloom.

Fuck.

I hesitated, then stepped out of the office and onto the top of the metal stairs. The iron groaned beneath my shoes as I looked down at the endless rows of shelves leading all the way to the entrance.

“Who’s there?” I called out, my voice rough, still half-asleep and shaking slightly.

Silence.

The kind that felt like it was listening back.

“Hello?” My voice sounded small against the vast, hollow space.

I went back into the office and yanked open the bottom drawer, pulling out the old flashlight we kept there for power outages. Its beam flickered weakly as I clicked it on, a dull yellow cone of light cutting through the dim warehouse gloom.

I swept it slowly across the shelves, the beam catching glints of shrink wrap, cardboard edges, metal rails, each one throwing strange, stretched-out shadows that seemed to move when I did.

But still nothing.

I drew a deep breath, ready to call out again, when a sound tore through the silence.

Footsteps.

Slow, deliberate footsteps coming from the far end of the aisle directly in front of the stairs.

I froze, my hand tightening around the flashlight. The beam wavered as I pointed it down the narrow corridor of shelves, swinging it back and forth. Nothing. Just empty space.

“Who’s there?” I called out again, my voice cracking somewhere between fear and exhaustion.

The footsteps grew faster. Closer. Echoing sharply against the concrete floor. My stomach turned cold. I stepped back without meaning to, eyes locked on the end of the aisle where the sound was coming from, waiting for something, anything, to appear.

Then, suddenly, the pace changed again. The footsteps broke into a sprint. Heavy, fast, pounding toward me.

“Shit!”

The noise slammed into the stairwell. Each metal step groaned and clanged under invisible weight, one after another, climbing. Closer and closer.

I dropped the flashlight. It hit the stairs with a harsh metallic clang and tumbled away, its beam spinning wildly before going dark.

Before I even realized what I was doing, I was already stumbling backward into the office. The door slammed shut with a metallic thud that echoed through the room, louder than I meant it to. My hands fumbled with the lock until it clicked into place.

I stood there for a second, chest heaving, trying to listen over the rush of blood in my ears. Then instinct took over. I backed away fast, nearly tripping over the chair, and pressed myself against the far wall. The cold plaster met my spine as I slid down, breath shallow and uneven, every muscle tensed.

For a moment, I didn’t dare move. It felt like the whole warehouse was listening, the air thick and heavy, holding its breath along with me.

My eyes stayed locked on the small rectangular glass pane set into the door. Every muscle in my body felt wired, tight with a mix of terror and raw anticipation. Whoever, or whatever had been climbing those stairs had to be standing just outside the office now. I could almost feel it on the other side, the way the air seemed to thicken and press inward. 

But when I forced myself to look, I saw nothing through the glass. Just the dim, empty stretch of the metal walkway outside, its surface catching the weak light from the overhead lamps.

I stood and took a few hesitant steps toward the door. My pulse thudded in my ears. I squinted through the narrow glass pane, scanning the dim corridor beyond. Nothing. The walkway lay empty, silent, and still as before.

My eyes flicked toward the computer screen on the desk. The wall of camera feeds flickered faintly. Rows of small blue-tinted images showing every corner of the warehouse. I leaned closer, my gaze sweeping over them one by one until it landed on the feed from the camera mounted just outside the office.

For a moment, I couldn’t process what I was seeing. The image showed the top of the stairs, the metal walkway, and the office door. This door. And something else. A shape. A figure standing perfectly still right in front of it.

My mouth went dry. I frowned, blinking hard, leaning in until my face was inches from the monitor. The outline was unmistakable: tall, motionless, human-shaped, but far too dark to be lit by the overhead lamps.

I cranked up the screen brightness and realized it was, in fact, a person. A man. He stood just beyond the office door, motionless beneath the dim exterior light. A gray parka hung loosely from his frame, the fabric torn in several places as though it had been snagged on branches or dragged across rough ground.

Dried mud caked his army pants, the dark, uneven stains streaking down the legs. Across the front of his jacket, blotches of something darker spread in irregular patches, soaking into the fabric in a way that made my stomach tighten.

There was something deeply wrong with his posture. One shoulder sagged noticeably lower than the other, causing his body to tilt at an unnatural angle. The corresponding arm bent inward across his stomach, twisted in a way no joint should allow. 

His head leaned forward and slightly to the side, as though it had been severed and clumsily set back in place without regard for alignment. Even his right leg jutted outward, crooked and unsteady, forcing his stance into a grotesque, off-balance shape.

His face appeared smeared with mud and what I guessed might have been blood, but the harsh overhead light behind him cast it in shadow on the monitor. From that angle, I couldn’t make out his features clearly.

I tore my eyes from the screen and looked back toward the door. Nothing. Just the faint reflection of my own pale face in the glass. Heart hammering, I turned back to the monitor. The figure hadn’t moved, but now it was closer, his head tilted downward, pressed against the glass pane as if trying to peer inside, his arms hung limply at its sides.

He was staring right at me.

Immediately I recoiled from the door, my eyes locked onto the little glass pane until my back hit the cold wall. Slowly, like I didn’t want to make a sound, I slid down into a crouch on the floor.

The metal handle began to jiggle, dipping down and then popping back up, each motion ending with a loud, metallic snap that made my heart slam against my ribs.

And then I heard it. A low, rasping cry seeped through the metal door. So faint and so full of pain that it made my chest tighten. It sounded like someone trying to speak through a crushed throat, each syllable dragged out with agonizing effort.

_“Hhheeeeeelpppp…”_

Every hair on my arms shot up at once. I grabbed the rolling office chair beside the desk and yanked it toward me, the wheels squealing softly across the floor. With trembling hands, I turned it so the back faced the door and shoved it against the frame like a poor-man’s barricade.

_“Yyyooouuuursss…”_

The word slithered through the thin gap beneath the door. I swallowed hard, my throat dry and tight. For a moment there was only silence. Heavy and suffocating. Then the voice returned, thinner this time. More strained. As if whatever stood outside had to force each sound through a ruined mouth.

_“Dddoooonnnttttttt…”_

The handle moved again, over and over… down, up, down, up… each time harder, each time with that same ugly snap, as if something on the other side were testing whether the door would give.

Thank God it didn’t. The bolt held. The door stayed shut and locked. I wrapped both hands around the armrests of the chair until my knuckles ached, every muscle ready to fling it at the door if it came to that. My breathing came in shallow, fast bursts.

I took a deep breath and snapped my head toward the computer screen just as a dull, heavy thud rattled through the room. My pulse surged. On the monitor, the figure was still there.

Right outside the door, its body rocking in a slow, unnatural rhythm. Then he lunged forward and slammed his head against the metal surface.

Thud.

The sound vibrated through the floor, sharp and metallic. I could almost feel it in my teeth.

Thud.

Again. Harder this time. The whole door trembled in its frame.

Thud.

Each impact came heavier than the last, his movements twitchy and desperate, like he wanted in. No matter how.

I crossed my arms tightly over my chest, bracing for whatever was about to break through that door, and squeezed my eyes shut. Every muscle in my body trembled as the pounding continued. Slow, steady, and maddening. I lost track of time crouched there on the cold floor, my back pressed hard against the wall, listening to the sound fade, then return, then fade again.

Eventually, exhaustion crept in. My body felt too heavy to move, and despite the fear still crawling under my skin, sleep dragged me under like a wave.

When I came to, there was a sound I didn’t register right away. Soft, rhythmic knocking. My eyes snapped open. For a second, I couldn’t remember where I was. The fluorescent lights hummed faintly overhead, and the monitors showed nothing but the usual static feeds of an empty warehouse.

I turned toward the door. A familiar face pressed against the glass pane, frowning, caught somewhere between confusion and anger. My stomach tightened. I scrambled to my feet, blinking hard, realizing how stiff my legs were from sleeping on the floor. My voice came out cracked and dry.

“Louie?”

He gestured impatiently for me to unlock the door.

“What the hell, man?” Louie barked the second I unlocked the door. He shoved it open, stepping inside with that half-angry, half-worried look he always got when something didn’t make sense.

His eyes darted around the office. The spilled coffee on the desk, the half-empty mug on the floor, the chair knocked slightly off-center. Then his gaze landed back on me.

“Uh, sorry. I fell asleep,” I muttered nervously.

“Were you drinking or something?” He looked me up and down, frowning.

“What? No! Of course not!” I shot back, rubbing the back of my neck.

“Why was the front door open?” he demanded, his voice rising. “I thought someone broke in. Scared the shit outta me when I saw it unlocked.”

I didn’t answer. My mind was still foggy, my heart pounding from the adrenaline spike. Instead, I stepped up to the office windows and leaned forward, scanning the aisles and long rows of shelves below.

Shadows stretched between the stacks, shifting slightly under the dim fluorescent lights, but everything looked empty.

I stepped back toward the desk, careful not to step in the sticky puddle of spilled coffee. My hands trembled slightly as I grabbed the mouse and pulled up the security footage from the night before. Clicking through the timestamps, my stomach sank as I watched the events unfold.

Nothing at first. The feeds were clean. Every camera angle looked perfectly normal. The parking lot, the aisles, the stairs. No figure. No movement. Nothing but the quiet, empty warehouse.

I checked the footage from the entrance camera first. The timestamp ran between one and three in the morning. There I was, walking out the front door, lighting a cigarette, pacing nervously across the empty parking lot.

A few minutes later, I returned to the small metal door and leaned down to check the fingerprint scanner. Everything matched what I remembered. Nothing seemed out of place.

Then I switched to the camera mounted inside the warehouse, right in front of the gate. That’s when my stomach dropped. The door, still closed, suddenly swung open. I froze, my hands gripping the edge of the desk.

Heart hammering, I clicked over to the camera near the top of the stairs. On-screen, I could see myself standing at the top, flashlight in hand, the weak beam slicing across the aisle below. My body froze, staring down toward the entrance like I’d just witnessed something impossible.

Then, without warning, I spun and bolted back into the office, disappearing out of frame. The flashlight slipped from my grip as I lunged for the door.

Seeing it all from multiple angles made it undeniable. Something had been out there, something I hadn’t been able to see with my own eyes. And it was closer than I ever wanted to imagine.

“What the hell was all that about?” Louie asked calmly from right behind me, arms crossed over his chest, his eyebrows raised.

“I…” I stammered, my throat dry. “The door security system… It's been acting up all night. The fingerprint scanner kept showing someone was trying to get in…”

I rubbed my face with both hands and let out a long, shaky sigh, trying to steady my racing heartbeat.

“And?” Louie pressed, leaning slightly forward. “Was anyone actually trying to get in?”

“No. As you can see for yourself. The door… it just opened by itself at one point. Probably a glitch.” I gestured toward the old leather-bound logbook sitting next to the keyboard. “I wrote everything down in the log for the morning shift.”

Louie shoved me lightly aside and started scrolling through the recorded footage from all the cameras. His eyes narrowed as he paused on the clip of me at the top of the stairs, flashlight beam cutting across the rows of shelves.

“What the hell happened here?” he asked, his voice quieter now, almost cautious.

“I…” My chest tightened, and I could feel my heart hammering in my ears as I tried to relive it. “… nothing.”

That was partly true. Nothing should have been out there. Nothing should have opened the door or triggered the scanner. And that was exactly what had terrified me.

“I should get going,” I finally said, my voice tight and a little unsteady. I bent over to grab some tissues and carefully wiped at the sticky mess I’d left on the desk and the floor.

Louie watched me, frowning.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

“I haven’t slept well, and my head is still spinning,” I added quickly, tossing the crumpled tissue into the trash bin next to the desk.

“So, you’re taking the week off starting today, right?” he asked again, picking up the logbook, eyes still on me, studying every move.

I just nodded, weakly.

“I’m not gonna write you a suspension this time for leaving the front door wide open all night,” he continued.

“But I did n—”

He held up a hand firmly. I swallowed my protest.

“That’s a huge no-no. If management finds out, you’ll be suspended immediately.”

I nodded again, gritting my teeth.

“Enjoy your time off. And make sure you’re back at work…” He glanced at the printed schedule pinned to the wall beside the computer. “…Friday night, next week.”

“I will,” I said, grabbing my small sling bag from the desk.

“And do me a favor, please.” His voice dropped a little, the tension in his expression easing. “Help yourself and get some rest. You look like crap. And try not to fall asleep on the job again… if you plan on keeping it. In this economy, you don’t want to stay unemployed for too long.”

Without another word, I walked out of the office. My body felt stiff and uncooperative, like it wasn’t entirely mine. My shoulder ached, my neck throbbed, and one leg dragged behind the others. I told myself it was just exhaustion.

After clocking out in a hurry, I started walking toward my car in the parking lot. The sun was already up, but thick clouds dulled the light, washing everything in a cold, gray-blue haze.

A low fog clung to the ground, and the morning air bit through my jacket as I crossed the lot. I could see dark storm clouds gathering in the distance.

I was about halfway to my car when something dark on the asphalt caught my eye.

At first, I thought it was just a damp patch, but then I noticed the shape. An uneven impression, smeared at the edges, like a shoe pressed through mud and left behind. There were a few more nearby, shallow and incomplete, fading as they crossed the lot.

One of them sat wrong, turned slightly outward, as if whoever had made it hadn’t been walking straight. My stomach tightened as I followed the marks with my eyes. They led toward the warehouse entrance, stopping right in front of the door.

Frowning, I traced the trail the other way. The prints grew darker, muddier, and sharper as I went, until they ended right beside my car. At the driver’s side door.

For a moment, I just stood there, the cold seeping through my shoes, a strange pressure settling in my chest.

I had the sudden, irrational urge to turn around, to go back inside and tell Louie exactly what had happened, what I had seen, and how it had terrified me.

But my phone buzzed in my pocket. I winced as I pulled it out. It was a text from my brother, asking if I was ready to hit the road to Oakenfell Forest. I thumbed a short reply, slid into the driver’s seat, and started the engine. I never looked back.",1,1770433898.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1qy2kv8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy2kv8,ХИМИЯ ГОРЬКОГО КОФЕ: ПОЧЕМУ ВЫ ВАРИТЕ ДЕГОТЬ,"Эта страшная большая молекула — хлорогеновая кислота

⚠️ ГОРЕЧЬ КОФЕ 
Многие списывают плохой вкус на дешевые зерна, но вкус, это результат процесса под названием ЭКСТРАКЦИЯ. Вода работает как растворитель, вымывая из молотого зерна разные вещества в строгом порядке. Сначала выходят легкие кислоты, затем сахара, а в самом конце, тяжелые и горькие соединения.

☕️  ТЕМПЕРАТУРНЫЙ ШОК
Главная ошибка, это использование крутого кипятка (100 градусов по Цельсию). При такой температуре запускается ТЕРМИЧЕСКОЕ РАЗЛОЖЕНИЕ хлорогеновой кислоты (C16H18O9).
ХЛОРОГЕНОВАЯ КИСЛОТА - это сложный эфир, который в норме отвечает за приятную кислинку. При перегреве она распадается на хиновую (C7H12O6) и кофейную (C9H8O4) кислоты.

🧬  ГОРЕЧЬ НА ПАЛЬЦАХ
Хиновая и кофейная кислоты, это те самые «короли горечи». На вкус они как жженая резина или таблетки. Когда вы заливаете кофе кипятком, вы мгновенно ломаете структуру хлорогеновой кислоты, превращая чашку в химический коктейль из продуктов распада.

🔥  ПРОГОРКАНИЕ ЖИРОВ
Второй фактор, это ОКИСЛЕНИЕ ЛИПИДОВ. В кофе много масел (C57H104O6 - пример триглицерида). Как только вы открываете пачку, кислород атакует эти молекулы.
Окисление - это химический процесс, при котором жиры превращаются в пероксиды. Из-за этого старый кофе пахнет пылью или затхлостью.

🔬  ПРАВИЛО ГРАДУСА
Идеальный диапазон для заваривания - от 91 до 95 градусов по Цельсию. При такой температуре энергии воды хватает, чтобы растворить кофеин (C8H10N4O2), но недостаточно, чтобы разрушить кислоты до состояния дегтя.

⚖️  ИТОГ
Просто дайте чайнику постоять 2 минуты после закипания. Это простейший способ контролировать кинетику процесса и не пить результаты неудачного химического эксперимента.

💡 Заметка: Свежая обжарка окисляется быстрее, так как структура зерна более пористая и открытая для кислорода.

🌫  Заметка: Если вода слишком жесткая, соли кальция мешают экстракции, делая вкус плоским и «грязным».

New Town had wound down for the night—the quarry lights low, the streets quiet—and the “Walnut Watch – Sat” group chat glowed on screens across town. 

Friends who knew each other’s doors, habits, and homes didn’t need maps or explanations; they just planned like family.

Now NewTown is becoming a family to its own. 

Rach: Team—tomorrow’s walnut grove trip. Saturday, easy morning. 0900 after breakfast at Chequers . We walk over together, eat, then ride up. Cinnamon rolls, coffee, trees. Everyone in?

Liz: 0900 is perfect. Chequers cinnamon rolls are non-negotiable.

ATVs: four total fueled ready to go , six people. Privates double up in the electric runabout for the lower road, then hop on with Lilli and Torres for the final climb. Only 6–7 minutes to the top—piece of cake.

(Black rifle coffee coming. Moderation: one mug at breakfast, one thermos for the grove. I’m trying, swear.)

Rach : Liz one thermos that’s it and a small mug which I’ll bring 

Liz : ok mom 

Rach : don’t back talk me or else 

Liz: 😝

Lilli: 0900 is good. Torres and I can do a late breakfast for once—Chequers has strong coffee and solid food.

Lilli : Rach , Liz “ Security update direct from the SM : security must be in sight of Rachel and Elizabeth at all times. No exceptions—Sergeant Major’s direct order while the capital situation with your father is unresolved, Liz. We stay visible, stay close.

We’ll bring Privates Shultz and Clink in one trip—no second run. They ride double in the EV  for the bottom part, then grab a seat on our ATVs for the last push. Keeps everything tight.

Torres: Copy that, Sergeant. 0900 works. I’ve been shadowing Rachel these last couple weeks—0400 starts are normal, but breakfast first is a nice change.

Rachel—still all quiet on your end? No concerns?

Rach: All good. Thanks for the shadow, Torres—you’ve been steady as hell.

(And yes, Liz is still my “little redhead demon.” Said with love. Usually.)

Liz: (laughing emoji + thumbs-up)

I’m fine. My previous shadow was on for the last few weeks but they’re off tomorrow—pulled for something else. 

Lilli I’m feeling much better that dad is ok But when I see him next I’m giving him a piece of my mind . Mom’s not to happy about him basically walking into a hornet nest with the traitors . 

Torres or Lilli in sight at all times—got it. I’ll behave.

Lilli: Glad you’re clear, Liz. We’ll keep it simple and visible.

I’ll brief Shultz and Clink tonight. They’re quiet, competent, already calling you “Professor” behind your back. You overheard once and grinned like you’d won a prize.

Torres: “Professor” suits. Self-taught biologist who can school any of us on Old Earth plants.

ATVs and runabout will be charged, helmets, water, first-aid—standard.

Liz: I’ll take “Professor” over “demon” any day.

Field microscope? I want leaf veins, insect activity, soil samples. These walnuts survived Drazzan burns—possible adaptation in play. Mycorrhizae, pH… I’m already buzzing.

Rach: Microscope’s packed. Pannier’s ready.

Lunch: portable heater coil + kettle for tea. Ham & cheese sandwiches, fresh greens, apple cordial to mix in. We’ll eat under the trees while Liz lectures us on nature.

Lilli: Lunch plan is solid. Boots recommended—top path’s still loose after the rain.

See you at Chequers 0900. I’ll drag Torres out if needed.

Torres: I’ll be there. Liz—maybe keep coffee to two mugs total? Just saying.

Liz: …I’ll consider it.

Rach: Liz please and , everyone. Walnut trees, friends, coffee, no drama. Perfect Saturday.

Rach: Night, little demon. Sleep well.

Tomorrow we see what Old Earth  walnut trees really left behind .  

2100 

Can I stay over and we can listen to earth music . I have an escort here . 

I guess but your sleeping on the couch 

Just finished this at 2100 Hrs 

 See you tomorrow ",1,1770433878.0,OpenHFY,0,1.0,False
1qy2km0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TyWrites/comments/1qy2km0/rest_area/,Rest Area,"My name is Jack Marshall. I’m 46 years old, and I have been an  over-the-road driver for nearly a decade. I was used to driving through thick and thin and had experienced plenty of the good, the bad, and the ugly out on the road, but nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to encounter.

I'd had a long day and was feeling exhausted, so when I spotted the large blue sign that read ""Rest Area,"" I pulled onto the exit ramp. My bladder was killing me, and my legs were aching for a good stretch. I quickly found a spot right in front of the small building; there wasn't a single car in sight. The rest area was totally deserted. I put my truck in park and cut the engine. Exiting the warm cab of the semi, I slammed the door shut and did a few quick stretches. 

I looked around. The silence was heavy, weighing more than the thirty tons of freight I carried in my truck. A shiver ran down my back, and I noticed it was actually very chilly out. I didn’t like this stop, so I told myself I’d just be in and out. 

The fluorescent light over the entrance of the men's bathroom hummed in a sickly, uneven rhythm, flickering like a dying pulse. I looked down and noticed the concrete was cracked with weeds growing through. Someone had graffitied the wall just outside the bathroom door, and there were even empty beer cans lying in the grass. The air was unnatural—no crickets, no wind—just the buzzing of the light and the smell of wet earth and old concrete. I debated waiting until the next stop, but it was fifty miles of winding mountain passes away.

I decided to just go here. The restroom door was a heavy slab of rusted iron. It groaned open with a high-pitched scream that echoed off the tiled walls inside. I stepped in. The air was colder here, smelling strongly of industrial bleach with something underneath it—something copper and sweet, like old pennies. I walked past the line of sinks. The mirrors were pitted with age, my own reflection looking distorted and gray in the stuttering light. I quickly peeked inside all of the stalls, finally choosing the one at the far end.

The metal door swung shut with a hollow clack. The toilet looked grimy, so I covered the seat with enough toilet paper to keep my skin from making contact. As I sat, the silence changed. It wasn't quiet anymore; it was expectant. I could hear the constant drip, drip, drip of a faucet. Then, a sound made the hair on my arms stand up: the soft, wet sound of bare feet peeling off the dirty linoleum floor. Squash, squash, squash.

Whoever it was, they were getting closer. Squash, squash. Now the sound came from the stall right next to mine. I froze, my breath hitching in my chest. I looked down at the gap between the floor and the stall divider. There were no feet. But the sound continued. It wasn't on the floor anymore—it was on the wall. Squash, squash, squash. Something was moving vertically, scaling the divider.

I slowly tilted my head back, looking toward the dark gap between the top of the stall and the ceiling. A hand appeared. It was too long, the fingers had too many knuckles, and the skin was the color of a drowned man. It didn't grip the top of the stall; it seemed to adhere to it. The tips of the fingers ended in long, cracked nails—or perhaps claws.

Then came the eyes. They didn't look human; they were wide, pale orbs with no pupils, reflecting the flickering overhead light like a cat’s. The creature didn't have a nose, just two long, vertical slits that hissed as they drew in my scent. It moved with a terrifying, liquid grace, sliding its torso over the top of the rusted metal wall. I tried to scream, but my throat felt like it had been filled with cold lead.

The thing opened its mouth. It didn't have teeth; it had rows of translucent, needle-thin fangs that vibrated, creating a low, humming sound that matched the frequency of the flickering lights exactly. My brain was screaming one word over and over again: Run!. But I realized I couldn't move a muscle. I was frozen in fear, sitting on that disgusting toilet with my pants around my ankles.

As the creature poured itself down the wall towards me, I had a strange realization. This rest area was so empty and creepy. Nothing had felt right from the moment I stepped down from my truck. As I sat there frozen, a strong odor hit me like a pile of bricks: bleach and that weird copper smell. Oh, my God, I thought. This place wasn't a bathroom. It was a giant throat. It was a trap. 
And I had just walked right in. I prayed that I wasn't about to become something's late night dinner. 

The low hum of the creature's teeth vibrated in my skull, a sound that bypassed my ears and went straight to my survival instinct. Adrenaline, sharp and cold, finally broke the paralysis. I didn't stand; I lunged. I threw my entire weight against the stall door, the rusted latch snapping like a twig. Nearly tripping over my pants, I quickly pulled them up and made a run for it. My heavy work boots skidded on the dirty, pink and blue tile floor. Behind me, I heard a wet thud—the sound of something heavy and boneless hitting the floor. Then came a rapid-fire clicking sound, like a thousand fingernails tapping on stone. It was chasing me.

I didn't look back. I burst through the heavy iron door and into the night air. The parking lot was no longer empty. A set of headlights was pulling in, the bright beams cutting through the mountain fog. It was a smaller rig, a flatbed, slowing down just a few yards from my truck.  

""Hey! Get out of here!"" I screamed, my voice raw. I frantically waved my arms over my head, stumbling toward the other driver's cab. I hunched over, taking in all the air my lungs would allow; my heart felt ready to burst. The driver of the flatbed, a younger man with a baseball cap pulled low, rolled down his window. 

""Don't go in there! Leave! Now!"" I screamed at him, still panting, one hand resting on his door. The man looked at my face, my disheveled clothes, and the way I was shaking. He didn't look scared; he looked annoyed.

""Easy, pops,"" the driver called out over the rumble of his engine. ""I just stopped to take a quick piss. You have a bad dream in there?"".

Ignoring his sarcasm, I continued trying to warn him. ""It's in there! Something is in the walls! This place is alive!"". I tried to explain what I had seen, but I could tell he wasn't listening. He just shook his head, put the truck in park, and hopped out. ""Listen, you've been on the road too long, man. Get some coffee. That should help"".

I watched, horrified, as the driver walked toward the small building. The flickering light over the entrance seemed to pulse faster, welcoming him. He reached for the iron door handle but stopped short. I knew why he hesitated—it was humming.

""Hey, do you hear that?"" the young driver asked. ""It sounds like... humming"". I didn't answer. I couldn't. I quickly made my way over to my truck, fishing around in my pocket for my keys while keeping my eyes on the bathroom door. The driver shrugged, lit a cigarette, and went inside.  

Finding my keys, I threw the door open and climbed into the truck. Just then, I heard a long, death-curdling scream. I knew it was the driver. ""What the fuck!"" I cried out in surprise. My truck wouldn't start at first. I turned the key in the ignition once, twice, thrice. Finally, the engine roared to life, and I sped the hell out of there. I looked into the rearview mirror to see the flatbed truck and the building getting smaller and smaller in the distance. 

I drove without stopping for three states. The sun began peeking over the horizon, turning the sky a dusty orange, but the warmth didn't reach me. The pit of my stomach felt like it was filled with cold ash. I tried to warn him, I thought. But the sound of his screams kept echoing over and over in my mind. It was all I could hear. I know I should have called the police while I was still in Oregon, but if that young guy didn't believe me, they probably wouldn't either. Hell, I'm not even sure I believe it myself.

I kept driving, thinking about the flatbed driver, but mostly I kept thinking about my own truck. I realized I hadn't checked the back. I hadn't checked the roof. As I drove down the silent highway, I began to hear it: a low humming. I listened more carefully and realized it wasn't coming from the road. It was coming from the back of my cabin. I adjusted the rearview mirror so I could see into the sleeper berth.

It was quick, but I saw it: a pale, many-knuckled hand quickly shuffling the bedsheet as if to hide what was underneath.  

Epilogue
Jack Marshall was never heard from again. His truck was found by a mechanic two days later on the side of the road, still running. The gas needle was still on full. A mechanic named Miller found everything to be in working order. There didn't seem to be anything wrong with the truck, so why would the driver just walk away?. 

Miller stood on the side of the highway with a cigarette between his lips, studying Jack's ID. The truck's driver-side door stood ajar. Miller pulled out his cell phone and began dialing 911 when suddenly, he heard humming. He turned and walked up to the open door; yes, the humming was coming from inside. Miller slowly climbed into the cabin to listen better. The humming was coming from the overhead vent right above his head.

1qy2kkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/christiandatingadvice/comments/1qy2kkh/ruined_it_with_godly_man/,Ruined it with Godly man,"Hi everyone,

I met a man who was basically everything I've ever prayed for, and messed it up within the first three dates. He's intellectual, so curious, Godly, and incredibly kindhearted. It's the first time I've ever met a man I could see a future with, found attractive and intellectually stimulating, and that actively pursued me. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for having messed it up.

Two weeks ago at our catechism group, after I asked a question during the discussion, he sought me out, we spent 20 minutes discussing, and got really deep on an important faith topic. During the whole conversation he was incredibly engaged and was asking incredible follow up questions that made me think in ways I normally wouldn't. I could tell just by speaking to him that he was an intelligent person, and humble enough to listen and contemplate what the other person says before speaking. He's so knowledgeable in the faith and I could see his love for the Lord.

Last week I was studying at our uni, and he somehow saw me and decided to talk to me. We really hit it off, and he asked me out. The next day he planned the date and we were going to visit a saint's tomb and get coffee afterwards. I really appreciated how forward he was and how he pursued me. He came up to me and he planned the date the day after. It felt like a dream come true.

I ended up getting a free ticket for a hike the next day, and we did that instead of the coffee+tomb date. We hiked for 8h and it went very well. He showed really good leadership at the start of the hike by taking it upon himself to speak with the front desk clerk while I went to the bathroom, and when I came back he had chosen the perfect hike for us. I'm normally very independent and untrusting but felt comfortable submitting to his leadership and competence. On the hike we spoke about so many topics and I find him fascinating and saw so many future life alignment points. We did the rosary together. We were throwing each other in the snow. I was so happy.

He planned a coffee study date two days later, which is when things turned south (or so I'm assuming). The coffee and study part itself was great, but afterwards when I walked him to his class I started speaking absolute nonsense. My family has some really messed up inside jokes, that honestly should not be said out loud because of how insulting and insensitive they are to an outside eye. He asked what makes me laugh the most in the world, and I said our family's inside jokes. So I proceeded to tell him one and he laughed. He left soon after to go to his class, and I was mentally slapping myself but thought it wouldn't be the end of the world.

Two days later, yesterday, he drove me to the catechism group and there were no problems as far as I'm aware that day. At least I don't think I did or said anything particularly repulsive. I told him at the end to text me when he wanted to see each other again and he smiled and said ok. I texted him that night to see if he wanted to study today, since I realized he's initiated everything else so maybe I should this time, and he said he was busy.

Today I get a text saying: He's thought a lot about the time we spent together, and he isn't interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with me. He's happy about the time we spent together and hopes I won't take it badly.

Basically I'm taking it quite badly and have been replaying every conversation and everything I did. And the only two things I can think about is the really really bad family joke I absolutely should not have said, and a slightly discriminating comment I said about a boy in my class.

I'm completely devastated because I don't understand what possessed me to say these things to him, when I would never to any of my other friends. These things really misrepresent the person I am and I normally have a much better filter.

To give more context as to why I feel like I've just lost out on the possibly best man I'll ever meet:

\- He's studying engineering and genuinely understands every part of every course he's taken. He was talking to me about how some of the physics formulas were derived. No normal person cares about how the cosine formula came to be, he's genuinely so intelligent and curious

\- He's so far in his faith journey and the steps he's taken to be stronger in his faith really inspires me

\- He wants a family and he has a very good view of love and a christian marriage, which aligns exactly with what I want. He dates to marry, like me

\- He's so curious about everything and asks such good questions. He was so interested in everything about my life, any and every subject to exist, and was asking so many things I've never even thought about

\- He has goals in life and actively works towards them. I have so much genuine respect and admiration for him

\- He studies philosophy/literature on the side of his engineering studies to not be too one-dimensional

\- He's very attractive

\- He has the voice of an angel

\- He actively pursued me

I've always known I was anxiously attached, and it's something I've tried working on by becoming more secure in myself. I thought I was better, but clearly not, since after he asked me out I was constantly talking/thinking about him, and fully thought nothing would stop us from entering a long term relationship, and eventually get married. I controlled myself in not texting him and not letting it show, but I definitely was feeling the anxious attachment in the way I was thinking. Now, despite having only been seeing him for a week, I feel like my heart's been ripped out and I've ruined the perfect opportunity for a Godly relationship that God put right in front of me.

How can I get over this? I don't think I'll ever meet someone as good as him again, and I'm so sad to have messed up our connection over not being able to shut my mouth on things I would normally never say. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for having lost him. I so badly want to beg him to give me another chance.

TL;DR : Perfect Godly man came into my life. I said offensive and insensitive things. He doesn't want me. Devastated. Don't know how to forgive myself and move on",2,1770433873.0,christiandatingadvice,1,1.0,False
1qy2k64,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qy2k64/i_work_night_shifts_at_a_warehouse_something_was/,I Work Night Shifts at a Warehouse. Something Was Trying to Get In on My Last Shift,"The warehouse was silent, save for the low hum of the monitors and the occasional deep creak in the walls, like the building itself was exhaling. I took another sip from my fifth cup of black coffee that evening, feeling the bitterness coat my tongue.

My eyelids were heavy, and I was just about to sink deeper into the swivel chair for a quick nap when my phone suddenly buzzed on the table, the sharp sound cutting through the quiet and jolting me upright.

It was a message from my brother, Jamie.

_Hey, you still up?_

I yawned and rubbed my eyes, the screen’s glare making them sting. My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a second before I typed back a quick reply: _Got the night shift again. What’s up?_

A few seconds passed as I stared at the blinking cursor, the soft buzz of the monitors filling the silence around me. The warehouse sat next to the only supermarket in town, a squat, grey building that most people barely noticed.

It wasn’t much to look at. Just rows of metal shelves stacked with boxes of cereal, bottled drinks, cleaning supplies, and whatever else the supermarket didn’t have room for out front. I’d been working there for about a year and a half, mostly during the night shift.

It wasn’t the most exciting job, but it paid the bills, and I didn’t have to deal with customers or chatter. Just me, the shelves, and the occasional rats that scurried behind the pallets.

During the day, the place was busy. Workers hauling boxes in and out, checking inventory, logging deliveries, and preparing shipments for the store floor. But at night, things slowed to a crawl.

The supermarket closed at ten, and once the last delivery truck was gone, the silence would set in. My job was mostly to keep an eye on the CCTV feeds, make sure no one tried to sneak in through the loading docks, and double-check that the power systems and refrigeration units were running properly.

Every couple of hours, I’d do a walk around the aisles, flashlight in hand, just to make sure nothing had fallen or leaked. Most nights were uneventful, long stretches of stillness broken only by the hum of the lights and the echo of my own footsteps.

ACCESS DENIED.

The mechanical woman’s voice from the entrance panel broke the silence, sharp and metallic, echoing faintly through the rows of shelves. I froze for a second. The sound bounced off the concrete walls in an oddly muffled way, like it didn’t belong there. I frowned and clicked to switch the front entrance camera to full screen.

Empty.

The loading bay outside looked the same as always. A stretch of bare concrete under harsh white lights, the security gate locked tight. Beyond that, the trees along the access road swayed gently in the wind, their shadows crawling across the pavement.

Nothing moved. No cars, no people, not even the usual stray cat that sometimes wandered near the dumpsters. Still, something about the silence felt heavier than before, as if the warehouse was holding its breath.

I shrugged and took another sip of my coffee. Probably just another glitch. The system acted up every now and then. Sometimes the sensor wouldn’t recognize your fingerprint at all no matter how many times you pressed your thumb against it. You’d have to wipe it clean, press again, curse a little, and hope it finally decided to cooperate.

During the day, the roll-up gate usually stayed open, with employees coming and going as they loaded stock or moved deliveries to the store. But at night, it was different. 

Once the last truck left and the supermarket lights went out, the gate came down and locked tight. After that, the only way in was through the small metal door, which could only be opened using the fingerprint panel.

I pulled the office door open and walked over to the rusty metal railing, leaning forward to peer down into the darkness below.

“Hello?”

My voice echoed through the warehouse, thin and warped, distorted in a way that made it sound wrong. Almost unfamiliar. I frowned, but brushed it off. The building was old anyway. Old buildings creaked, groaned, and did weird things all the time.

I turned back toward the door, grabbed the handle and pushed. It didn’t move. I tried again, lifting it slightly before shoving harder. Nothing. Still stuck. Fuck. First the fingerprint scanner, now this. I muttered under my breath and jiggled the handle, irritation creeping into my chest as I put my weight against it. The door refused to budge.

I leaned closer and tapped my forehead lightly against the small rectangular glass window, once, then again and again, feeling really stupid. The glass was colder than I expected. 

I pulled back quickly, unsettled by a strange, fleeting thought that someone might be pressing back from the other side. I shook it off. What the hell? Maybe I’d have to jimmy it open

I took a deep breath and forced myself to calm down, then wrapped my hand around the handle again and twisted it sharply in one precise motion. Click. The door swung open. 

For just a second, I caught my reflection in the glass. It looked distorted, stretched wrong by the angle and the light. My face looked exhausted. Sad, somehow. Jesus. I really did need some time off work.

I flipped through the logbook lazily until I found the last entry. Grabbing a pen, I jotted down a quick note about the entrance panel glitch and the stupid door being stuck on a fresh page, just enough detail so the morning shift could pass it along to the IT department. No point making a big deal out of it. Stuff like this happened all the time.

Then I sat down and clicked through the monitors until I found the one showing the cold room readings. All the temperature indicators were still steady, glowing a faint green across the screen. Good. At least that part of the system was behaving tonight.

It was just one of those long, sleepy nights where time seemed to crawl. The hum of the refrigeration units filled the background like white noise, and the only thing keeping me awake was the caffeine still lingering in my veins. A few more hours, I told myself. Just hang on until morning comes then I can clock out, and head home.

I was just about to lean back and let myself relax for a bit when it started again.

ACCESS DENIED.

The robotic voice cut through the silence, echoing faintly through the aisles. It sounded distant this time, like it was coming from somewhere deep inside the building, or maybe just bouncing weirdly off the concrete walls.

“What the fuck…” I muttered, fumbling for the mouse. I clicked over to the entrance camera again. Still empty. Exactly like before.

I refreshed the feed a few times, watching the seconds tick in the corner of the screen just to make sure it was live. Nothing. The same stretch of pavement, the same still trees. Not a soul in sight.

A cold, prickling feeling crept up the back of my neck. I was about to stand up when my phone suddenly buzzed against the desk, the vibration loud in the quiet room. It skidded dangerously close to the edge before I snatched it up.

“Yes?” I answered lazily.

_“Hey, dipshit,”_ said my brother, his voice crackling through. _“Don’t fall asleep on me yet. Tell me you requested those days off.”_

“Nice to hear from you too. Actually… can you call me ba—”

_“Dude, come on. Oakenfell Forest tomorrow. Just like old times. I already picked up the tent and other stuff from that pricey camping rental place.”_

“Jesus, man, relax. Louie already signed off on my one-week leave yesterday.”

He let out a giddy laugh that was far too high-pitched for a grown man. My brother could be unbearable when he wanted something badly enough.

The truth was, I’d never been much of an outdoors person. Not like him. He thrived on dirt trails, campfires, and sleeping under open skies, while I preferred solid walls and a reliable mattress.

Still, when we were kids, our father used to drag us into the wilderness for a few nights at a time. We’d sleep beneath a sprawl of stars, far from the noise of town, wrapped in that deep, almost sacred silence you only find in the wilderness.

Then we grew up. Work schedules, bills, and adult obligations pulled us in different directions, and those small escapes into the wild slowly disappeared.

After Dad passed away a few years ago, my brother made me promise we’d keep the tradition alive, just the two of us, a few nights outdoors every now and then, in his honor. The problem was our lives rarely aligned. For months, he’d been nagging me to request time off so we could finally go camping again.

_“Did you ask your friend if you could borrow his camera?”_ he went on.

“Yes,” I replied, already losing patience. “I’ll swing by Jerry’s place later and pick it up on my way to yours. Happy now?”

_“You better,”_ he said. _“I’m not doing this hike solo again. You bail, I’m hiking Blue Hill and spreading your ashes in a deer’s poo.”_

“Relax. I wanna go. Seriously. I need to get outta here for a few days anyway. This place is like… weird.”

I could hear him yawn on the other end.

_“Bet it’s creepy as hell at night.”_

“It’s not that bad,” I said, glancing at the screens.”

_“You should bring a Ouija board. Summon some ghosts. Spice things up.”_

“Why are you so hell-bent on going there, anyway?” I asked.

He let out a small, excited chuckle.

_“Dad went camping in Oakenfell Forest once, said it was beautiful but he never went back. He wanted to, though.”_

I frowned, staring absently at the floor as a vague memory surfaced.

“Wait… did you say Oakenfell Forest? Isn’t that where a group of hikers went missing a few years ago?”

I turned to my computer. The screen glowed to life as my fingers hovered over the keyboard. I quickly typed ‘Oakenfell Forest Incident’ into the search bar and hit enter.

“Oh, this doesn’t sound good,” I muttered, scrolling through the results. “It says here they went missing under mysterious circumstances. Some of their backpacks, jackets, and shoes were found scattered around the cliffside.” 

_”Yeah yeah yeah. Creepy stuff.”_

I clicked on one of the articles and skimmed it.

“But strangely enough, none of them have ever been found. Dead or alive.” I leaned back in my chair, phone wedged between my shoulder and ear as I continued reading aloud. “Search parties, helicopters, the whole thing. Nothing. They just… vanished.”

My brother scoffed audibly.

_“People disappear under mysterious circumstances everywhere, every day. That doesn’t mean anything.”_

“We could be them,” I said grimly, only half joking.

_“Don’t be such a buzzkill, asshole.”_

“I’m serious,” I said, ignoring him as I clicked on the next article. The page took a moment to load, then filled with another wall of text and grainy photographs. “Those hikers weren’t the only ones.”

He let out an exaggerated groan through the phone. I could hear him chewing loudly on the other end.

“Are you eating right now?”

_“Chips,”_ he said. _“Continue your ghost story.”_

“Listen,” I insisted, leaning closer to the screen. “It says here there’s been a string of other creepy disappearances… Not just recently.”

_“Here we go.”_

I scrolled down, skimming through paragraphs of dates and names.

“Some of these cases go way back. Long before it even became an official camping site.”

A brief silence hung on the line.

_“You really know how to sell a vacation, you know that?”_ He said. _“You’ve been reading way too much Missing 411. That guy is a fra—”_

ACCESS DENIED.

_“—what was that?”_ Jamie asked.

“You heard that?” I asked, already on my feet, staring out at the dark aisles below.

_“Uh. Yeah.”_

I rubbed my forehead. “Someone tried to get in. Biometric reader went off. Probably a glitch. Hang on.”

My fingers trembled as I opened the system log. Same fingerprint attempt. No match.

_“Someone’s out there?”_ he asked.

“No,” I muttered quickly, eyes fixed on the feed. “Camera’s empty. No movement. It’s probably just acting up again.”

I didn’t entirely believe it, though. The voice still echoed faintly in my head, like it was coming from somewhere far inside the warehouse.

_“Maybe it’s a raccoon,”_ he joked. _“A very determined, very tech-savvy raccoon.”_

“Shut up.”

ACCESS DENIED.

_“Still happening?”_ Jamie asked, his voice tightening just a little.

“Yeah. Feels... off.”

I refreshed the feed. Nothing changed. Still no one at the entrance. No flicker. No movement. Just the sound of that damn voice.

_“Maybe someone forgot their ID or something,”_ Jamie said.

“Nobody’s supposed to be coming in this late,” I muttered, frowning at the timestamp in the corner of the screen. “And there’s nobody at the entrance. It’s fucking empty!”

_“What time is it?”_

“Almost two.”

There was a brief pause on the line.

_“Welp. That’s not unsettling at all.”_

I didn’t answer. The hum of the monitors suddenly felt louder, like the warehouse itself was listening.

I stood up and walked a slow circle around the office, trying to shake off the tension building in my shoulders. Through the glass walls, I could see the entire warehouse below. Rows and rows of shelves stacked high with boxes and crates, forming a maze of shadowy aisles that seemed to go on forever.

I reached over to the control panel and flipped on the overhead lights, one section at a time. With a low hum, the fluorescents flickered to life across the warehouse. First near the loading bay, then the cold storage area, then the aisles farther back. Bright white light flooded every corner. Nothing moved. No figures. No sound beyond the distant buzz of electricity.

I leaned closer to the glass, scanning the floor carefully, half expecting to see someone or something ducking behind a pallet. But there was nothing. Just the endless stillness of a space that suddenly felt too large and too empty.

_“Okay,”_ Jamie said. _“So if this turns into, like, some found footage horror… shit like that, what’s the protocol? You hide behind a forklift?”_

“If I died and turned into a ghost, I’d haunt you for the rest of your life,” I told him.

He snorted.

_“You’d probably still show up for work the next night… and haunt that place. Took me years to get you to take even a few days off.”_

“I’ll call you back, okay? I’m just gonna check it out.”

_“Be careful, dude.”_

I hung up, slipped the phone into my pocket, and pushed open the office door. The metal stairs groaned under my sneakers as I made my way down, each step echoing through the empty space.

I’d left only a few of the overhead lamps on, so most of the warehouse was swallowed in shadow. The cold room lights cast long, yellow rectangles across the floor, stretching my shadow out toward the rows of shelves and the far wall on my left.

The air was cool and still, the faint hum of the refrigeration units filling the silence. I moved between two tall shelving racks, the narrow aisle amplifying the sound of my footsteps. The place always felt different at night.

I thought back to the shift handover earlier that evening. No one had said a word about the damn door acting up. I was sure of it.

As soon as I reached the small gray door, I grabbed the handle and pulled it open. A cool rush of night air hit my face, carrying with it the hum of cicadas buzzing somewhere out in the dark.

I zipped my jacket all the way up to my chin and stepped outside. The heavy metal door creaked softly as it swung shut behind me.

The parking lot stretched out quiet and still, bathed in patches of weak yellow light from the overhead lamps. My car sat near the chain-link fence in front of the warehouse, half-hidden in shadow. The old delivery truck was parked in its usual spot, way off in the far corner, where the light barely reached.

Everything looked the same as it always did.

I turned my head toward the supermarket next door. The building loomed over the lot, a flat gray slab of concrete and glass. Now and then, a car passed on the main road beyond it, headlights sliding across the facade and stretching long shadows over the wall.

Nothing moved. No raccoons. No cats. No stray dogs nosing around the bins. Just the faint hum of the floodlights and the chorus of insects in the trees beyond the fence. The air smelled faintly of dust, rain-soaked asphalt, and something metallic drifting from the warehouse vents.

I rubbed the back of my neck, trying to shake off the tension crawling under my skin. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a cigarette. The first drag steadied me. The ember glowed faint orange against the dark, the smoke curling lazily up into the night.

Might as well have one, I thought. No way I was going back in there yet. Not until I checked what the fuck was wrong with that damned fingerprint scanner.

Everything seemed quiet and empty, yet I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Across the lot, the supermarket’s upper windows reflected the amber glow of the streetlamps. Empty, still, like a row of watchful eyes staring down at me.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out and glanced at the screen. Another text from Jamie.

_So?_

I thumbed back a quick reply: _Nothing. Just a glitch. Out for a quick smoke._

Sent it, shoved the phone back into my pocket, and took another long drag. The night stayed perfectly still. Only the faint hiss of the cigarette and the hum of the lights kept me company.

After a few minutes of staring at the deserted parking lot, I flicked my second cigarette onto the asphalt and watched the tiny ember roll a few inches before dying out. My fingers were starting to go numb from the cold. I told myself I’d stalled long enough.

I slipped the pack of cigarettes back into my pocket and started walking toward the door. The warehouse was dead silent except for the faint echo of my footsteps against the concrete. 

When I reached the small metal door, I frowned at the fingerprint scanner. The little monitor glowed its usual dull blue, flickering slightly like it was tired of doing its job.

I pressed my finger lightly against the sensor.

ACCESS DENIED

I tried again, this time a little firmer.

ACCESS DENIED

I sighed under my breath.

“Piece of junk.”

ACCESS DENIED

The thing probably just needed a little encouragement. Maybe a smack or two.

ACCESS DENIED

I rubbed the cuff of my jacket hard against the scanner, brushing away a faint smudge of dust, and tried again.

ACCESS DENIED.

I let out a long, frustrated sigh and dug into my pocket, pulling out a tissue and scrubbing at the scanner with more force than necessary, like it had personally wronged me. Then…

ACCESS GRANTED

A soft click. I grabbed the handle and pushed the door open. The hinges groaned like they hadn’t been used in years, sending a faint echo across the empty warehouse. I stepped through cautiously, scanning the dim space ahead, and double-checked the lock behind me. A quick tug on the handle reassured me it was secure.

With a deep breath, I squared my shoulders and started back across the warehouse floor, each step feeling heavier than the last. The air inside felt cooler.

The faint hum from the cold room in the distance was barely audible, but it was there. A reminder that the building wasn’t completely dead. I climbed the metal stairs and slipped back into the small office upstairs.

I sank back into my chair and glanced at the monitor. 2:30 a.m. Still a few hours to go. I sighed and fished out my phone, typing a quick message to my brother: _Still up, loser?_

I took a sip of my cold coffee, and out of habit, checked the cold room readings on the screen again for what had to be the tenth time tonight. Everything looked fine.

My phone buzzed.

_Barely. So was it a ghost?_

_You wish_, I typed back. _Told you, it was just the fingerprint scanner acting up again._

I yawned, set the phone down, and clicked on another browser tab. YouTube loaded up, and I scrolled until I found my favorite travel channel. Some guy hiking through frozen mountain passes somewhere in Norway. Might as well let someone else’s adventure keep me awake for a bit.

A few minutes later, my phone lit up on the desk.

_Disappointing. TTYL. Going to bed soon._

I turned the volume down a little and switched on the closed captions before leaning back into my chair. My eyelids felt heavy despite the ridiculous amount of coffee I’d had that night. Once or twice, I would check the entrance camera, see nothing, and sink back down.

ACCESS DENIED

This is getting really annoying now, I thought, rubbing my eyes. Somebody better fix that damned panel first thing in the morning.

At some point after three, I was jolted awake by a silence so deep it almost felt solid. For a second, I just sat there, blinking stupidly, disoriented and unsure of where I was. Then the faint hum of the fluorescent lights brought me back to reality. I exhaled, stretched, and reached for my coffee, its surface cold and oily under the dim glow of the monitor.

ACCESS GRANTED.

I set the coffee down too fast, sloshing what was left across the desk, and fumbled for the mouse. The monitor flickered as I clicked into the entrance camera feed. The parking lot outside stared back at me. Empty, still, the same blank stretch of concrete under the white security lights.

My pulse quickened. I switched to the camera mounted on the ceiling above the gate.

The door swung open. Very slowly.

A faint, metallic creak echoed through the warehouse. Distant but unmistakable, bouncing off the concrete walls. I sucked in a sharp breath, my skin prickling. The live feed showed nothing. No figure. No shadow. Just the door, wide open to empty air.

I shot up from my chair and reached for the control panel, flipping the switch to turn on every section of overhead lighting. My eyes darted toward the warehouse below through the office glass.

Nothing.

For some reason, most of the lights stayed off. A few weak fluorescents flickered to life, casting long, trembling shadows across the aisles. The rest of the vast space remained drowned in dim yellow gloom.

Fuck.

I hesitated, then stepped out of the office and onto the top of the metal stairs. The iron groaned beneath my shoes as I looked down at the endless rows of shelves leading all the way to the entrance.

“Who’s there?” I called out, my voice rough, still half-asleep and shaking slightly.

Silence.

The kind that felt like it was listening back.

“Hello?” My voice sounded small against the vast, hollow space.

I went back into the office and yanked open the bottom drawer, pulling out the old flashlight we kept there for power outages. Its beam flickered weakly as I clicked it on, a dull yellow cone of light cutting through the dim warehouse gloom.

I swept it slowly across the shelves, the beam catching glints of shrink wrap, cardboard edges, metal rails, each one throwing strange, stretched-out shadows that seemed to move when I did.

But still nothing.

I drew a deep breath, ready to call out again, when a sound tore through the silence.

Footsteps.

Slow, deliberate footsteps coming from the far end of the aisle directly in front of the stairs.

I froze, my hand tightening around the flashlight. The beam wavered as I pointed it down the narrow corridor of shelves, swinging it back and forth. Nothing. Just empty space.

“Who’s there?” I called out again, my voice cracking somewhere between fear and exhaustion.

The footsteps grew faster. Closer. Echoing sharply against the concrete floor. My stomach turned cold. I stepped back without meaning to, eyes locked on the end of the aisle where the sound was coming from, waiting for something, anything, to appear.

Then, suddenly, the pace changed again. The footsteps broke into a sprint. Heavy, fast, pounding toward me.

“Shit!”

The noise slammed into the stairwell. Each metal step groaned and clanged under invisible weight, one after another, climbing. Closer and closer.

I dropped the flashlight. It hit the stairs with a harsh metallic clang and tumbled away, its beam spinning wildly before going dark.

Before I even realized what I was doing, I was already stumbling backward into the office. The door slammed shut with a metallic thud that echoed through the room, louder than I meant it to. My hands fumbled with the lock until it clicked into place.

I stood there for a second, chest heaving, trying to listen over the rush of blood in my ears. Then instinct took over. I backed away fast, nearly tripping over the chair, and pressed myself against the far wall. The cold plaster met my spine as I slid down, breath shallow and uneven, every muscle tensed.

For a moment, I didn’t dare move. It felt like the whole warehouse was listening, the air thick and heavy, holding its breath along with me.

My eyes stayed locked on the small rectangular glass pane set into the door. Every muscle in my body felt wired, tight with a mix of terror and raw anticipation. Whoever, or whatever had been climbing those stairs had to be standing just outside the office now. I could almost feel it on the other side, the way the air seemed to thicken and press inward. 

But when I forced myself to look, I saw nothing through the glass. Just the dim, empty stretch of the metal walkway outside, its surface catching the weak light from the overhead lamps.

I stood and took a few hesitant steps toward the door. My pulse thudded in my ears. I squinted through the narrow glass pane, scanning the dim corridor beyond. Nothing. The walkway lay empty, silent, and still as before.

My eyes flicked toward the computer screen on the desk. The wall of camera feeds flickered faintly. Rows of small blue-tinted images showing every corner of the warehouse. I leaned closer, my gaze sweeping over them one by one until it landed on the feed from the camera mounted just outside the office.

For a moment, I couldn’t process what I was seeing. The image showed the top of the stairs, the metal walkway, and the office door. This door. And something else. A shape. A figure standing perfectly still right in front of it.

My mouth went dry. I frowned, blinking hard, leaning in until my face was inches from the monitor. The outline was unmistakable: tall, motionless, human-shaped, but far too dark to be lit by the overhead lamps.

I cranked up the screen brightness and realized it was, in fact, a person. A man. He stood just beyond the office door, motionless beneath the dim exterior light. A gray parka hung loosely from his frame, the fabric torn in several places as though it had been snagged on branches or dragged across rough ground.

Dried mud caked his army pants, the dark, uneven stains streaking down the legs. Across the front of his jacket, blotches of something darker spread in irregular patches, soaking into the fabric in a way that made my stomach tighten.

There was something deeply wrong with his posture. One shoulder sagged noticeably lower than the other, causing his body to tilt at an unnatural angle. The corresponding arm bent inward across his stomach, twisted in a way no joint should allow. 

His head leaned forward and slightly to the side, as though it had been severed and clumsily set back in place without regard for alignment. Even his right leg jutted outward, crooked and unsteady, forcing his stance into a grotesque, off-balance shape.

His face appeared smeared with mud and what I guessed might have been blood, but the harsh overhead light behind him cast it in shadow on the monitor. From that angle, I couldn’t make out his features clearly.

I tore my eyes from the screen and looked back toward the door. Nothing. Just the faint reflection of my own pale face in the glass. Heart hammering, I turned back to the monitor. The figure hadn’t moved, but now it was closer, his head tilted downward, pressed against the glass pane as if trying to peer inside, his arms hung limply at its sides.

He was staring right at me.

Immediately I recoiled from the door, my eyes locked onto the little glass pane until my back hit the cold wall. Slowly, like I didn’t want to make a sound, I slid down into a crouch on the floor.

The metal handle began to jiggle, dipping down and then popping back up, each motion ending with a loud, metallic snap that made my heart slam against my ribs.

And then I heard it. A low, rasping cry seeped through the metal door. So faint and so full of pain that it made my chest tighten. It sounded like someone trying to speak through a crushed throat, each syllable dragged out with agonizing effort.

_“Hhheeeeeelpppp…”_

Every hair on my arms shot up at once. I grabbed the rolling office chair beside the desk and yanked it toward me, the wheels squealing softly across the floor. With trembling hands, I turned it so the back faced the door and shoved it against the frame like a poor-man’s barricade.

_“Yyyooouuuursss…”_

The word slithered through the thin gap beneath the door. I swallowed hard, my throat dry and tight. For a moment there was only silence. Heavy and suffocating. Then the voice returned, thinner this time. More strained. As if whatever stood outside had to force each sound through a ruined mouth.

_“Dddoooonnnttttttt…”_

The handle moved again, over and over… down, up, down, up… each time harder, each time with that same ugly snap, as if something on the other side were testing whether the door would give.

Thank God it didn’t. The bolt held. The door stayed shut and locked. I wrapped both hands around the armrests of the chair until my knuckles ached, every muscle ready to fling it at the door if it came to that. My breathing came in shallow, fast bursts.

I took a deep breath and snapped my head toward the computer screen just as a dull, heavy thud rattled through the room. My pulse surged. On the monitor, the figure was still there.

Right outside the door, its body rocking in a slow, unnatural rhythm. Then he lunged forward and slammed his head against the metal surface.

Thud.

The sound vibrated through the floor, sharp and metallic. I could almost feel it in my teeth.

Thud.

Again. Harder this time. The whole door trembled in its frame.

Thud.

Each impact came heavier than the last, his movements twitchy and desperate, like he wanted in. No matter how.

I crossed my arms tightly over my chest, bracing for whatever was about to break through that door, and squeezed my eyes shut. Every muscle in my body trembled as the pounding continued. Slow, steady, and maddening. I lost track of time crouched there on the cold floor, my back pressed hard against the wall, listening to the sound fade, then return, then fade again.

Eventually, exhaustion crept in. My body felt too heavy to move, and despite the fear still crawling under my skin, sleep dragged me under like a wave.

When I came to, there was a sound I didn’t register right away. Soft, rhythmic knocking. My eyes snapped open. For a second, I couldn’t remember where I was. The fluorescent lights hummed faintly overhead, and the monitors showed nothing but the usual static feeds of an empty warehouse.

I turned toward the door. A familiar face pressed against the glass pane, frowning, caught somewhere between confusion and anger. My stomach tightened. I scrambled to my feet, blinking hard, realizing how stiff my legs were from sleeping on the floor. My voice came out cracked and dry.

“Louie?”

He gestured impatiently for me to unlock the door.

“What the hell, man?” Louie barked the second I unlocked the door. He shoved it open, stepping inside with that half-angry, half-worried look he always got when something didn’t make sense.

His eyes darted around the office. The spilled coffee on the desk, the half-empty mug on the floor, the chair knocked slightly off-center. Then his gaze landed back on me.

“Uh, sorry. I fell asleep,” I muttered nervously.

“Were you drinking or something?” He looked me up and down, frowning.

“What? No! Of course not!” I shot back, rubbing the back of my neck.

“Why was the front door open?” he demanded, his voice rising. “I thought someone broke in. Scared the shit outta me when I saw it unlocked.”

I didn’t answer. My mind was still foggy, my heart pounding from the adrenaline spike. Instead, I stepped up to the office windows and leaned forward, scanning the aisles and long rows of shelves below.

Shadows stretched between the stacks, shifting slightly under the dim fluorescent lights, but everything looked empty.

I stepped back toward the desk, careful not to step in the sticky puddle of spilled coffee. My hands trembled slightly as I grabbed the mouse and pulled up the security footage from the night before. Clicking through the timestamps, my stomach sank as I watched the events unfold.

Nothing at first. The feeds were clean. Every camera angle looked perfectly normal. The parking lot, the aisles, the stairs. No figure. No movement. Nothing but the quiet, empty warehouse.

I checked the footage from the entrance camera first. The timestamp ran between one and three in the morning. There I was, walking out the front door, lighting a cigarette, pacing nervously across the empty parking lot.

A few minutes later, I returned to the small metal door and leaned down to check the fingerprint scanner. Everything matched what I remembered. Nothing seemed out of place.

Then I switched to the camera mounted inside the warehouse, right in front of the gate. That’s when my stomach dropped. The door, still closed, suddenly swung open. I froze, my hands gripping the edge of the desk.

Heart hammering, I clicked over to the camera near the top of the stairs. On-screen, I could see myself standing at the top, flashlight in hand, the weak beam slicing across the aisle below. My body froze, staring down toward the entrance like I’d just witnessed something impossible.

Then, without warning, I spun and bolted back into the office, disappearing out of frame. The flashlight slipped from my grip as I lunged for the door.

Seeing it all from multiple angles made it undeniable. Something had been out there, something I hadn’t been able to see with my own eyes. And it was closer than I ever wanted to imagine.

“What the hell was all that about?” Louie asked calmly from right behind me, arms crossed over his chest, his eyebrows raised.

“I…” I stammered, my throat dry. “The door security system… It's been acting up all night. The fingerprint scanner kept showing someone was trying to get in…”

I rubbed my face with both hands and let out a long, shaky sigh, trying to steady my racing heartbeat.

“And?” Louie pressed, leaning slightly forward. “Was anyone actually trying to get in?”

“No. As you can see for yourself. The door… it just opened by itself at one point. Probably a glitch.” I gestured toward the old leather-bound logbook sitting next to the keyboard. “I wrote everything down in the log for the morning shift.”

Louie shoved me lightly aside and started scrolling through the recorded footage from all the cameras. His eyes narrowed as he paused on the clip of me at the top of the stairs, flashlight beam cutting across the rows of shelves.

“What the hell happened here?” he asked, his voice quieter now, almost cautious.

“I…” My chest tightened, and I could feel my heart hammering in my ears as I tried to relive it. “… nothing.”

That was partly true. Nothing should have been out there. Nothing should have opened the door or triggered the scanner. And that was exactly what had terrified me.

“I should get going,” I finally said, my voice tight and a little unsteady. I bent over to grab some tissues and carefully wiped at the sticky mess I’d left on the desk and the floor.

Louie watched me, frowning.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

“I haven’t slept well, and my head is still spinning,” I added quickly, tossing the crumpled tissue into the trash bin next to the desk.

“So, you’re taking the week off starting today, right?” he asked again, picking up the logbook, eyes still on me, studying every move.

I just nodded, weakly.

“I’m not gonna write you a suspension this time for leaving the front door wide open all night,” he continued.

“But I did n—”

He held up a hand firmly. I swallowed my protest.

“That’s a huge no-no. If management finds out, you’ll be suspended immediately.”

I nodded again, gritting my teeth.

“Enjoy your time off. And make sure you’re back at work…” He glanced at the printed schedule pinned to the wall beside the computer. “…Friday night, next week.”

“I will,” I said, grabbing my small sling bag from the desk.

“And do me a favor, please.” His voice dropped a little, the tension in his expression easing. “Help yourself and get some rest. You look like crap. And try not to fall asleep on the job again… if you plan on keeping it. In this economy, you don’t want to stay unemployed for too long.”

Without another word, I walked out of the office. My body felt stiff and uncooperative, like it wasn’t entirely mine. My shoulder ached, my neck throbbed, and one leg dragged behind the others. I told myself it was just exhaustion.

After clocking out in a hurry, I started walking toward my car in the parking lot. The sun was already up, but thick clouds dulled the light, washing everything in a cold, gray-blue haze.

A low fog clung to the ground, and the morning air bit through my jacket as I crossed the lot. I could see dark storm clouds gathering in the distance.

I was about halfway to my car when something dark on the asphalt caught my eye.

At first, I thought it was just a damp patch, but then I noticed the shape. An uneven impression, smeared at the edges, like a shoe pressed through mud and left behind. There were a few more nearby, shallow and incomplete, fading as they crossed the lot.

One of them sat wrong, turned slightly outward, as if whoever had made it hadn’t been walking straight. My stomach tightened as I followed the marks with my eyes. They led toward the warehouse entrance, stopping right in front of the door.

Frowning, I traced the trail the other way. The prints grew darker, muddier, and sharper as I went, until they ended right beside my car. At the driver’s side door.

For a moment, I just stood there, the cold seeping through my shoes, a strange pressure settling in my chest.

I had the sudden, irrational urge to turn around, to go back inside and tell Louie exactly what had happened, what I had seen, and how it had terrified me.

But my phone buzzed in my pocket. I winced as I pulled it out. It was a text from my brother, asking if I was ready to hit the road to Oakenfell Forest. I thumbed a short reply, slid into the driver’s seat, and started the engine. I never looked back.",2,1770433840.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

1qy2jgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qy2jgp/health_anxiety/,Health anxiety,"Hi everyone! This is my first time posting but I’m really excited to get more involved in this community! 

I was diagnosed last spring at age 23 with ADHD. I was prescribed 5 mg IR twice a day… which I took at the same time. Then moved ip to 15 mg XR and recently made the switch to 30 mg Concerta (methylphenidate HCl). 

I’ve been having a lot of health anxiety. I’m sitting here writing this after deep diving into heart attacks symptoms in women for an hour instead of doing much needed work. All because I have horrible left shoulder blade pain that in my head has to be heart attack symptoms… definitely not just back pain/soreness from working long hours in an office. 

Adding a stimulant to my daily life gave me a lot of health anxiety. I have a huge fear of having a heart attack. I stopped drinking coffee all together and don’t drink energy drinks. My issue is that I am addicted to Coca Cola or Diet Cokes and I also smoke weed/ take edibles. 

I quit vaping months before I got diagnosed which was a huge win for me but I cannot let go of my weed vape. On adderall I would hit my pen regularly… it truly had no effect on it. I would argue that it helped me. 

But I do know it’s bad for my heart to be doing stimulants and weed. Now that I started Concerta a few days ago my health anxiety is peaking… 

I would appreciate any words or tips that help. I am just terrified and have no where to turn to because my friends, partners and family never understand me. None of them have ADHD, or even smoke weed so I’ve been going through life on my own basically ",1,1770433789.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

According to the dumb espherical Earth HYPOTHESIS, the Earth spins at 1670Km/h, but why when I jump i fall at the same place? And there's more, unlike all you globetards, I actually study physics, I watch hundreds of Facebook and Youtube videos everyday, and I saw something about a thing that absolutely destroys the Globe Earth, its called ""Angular Momentum"", you guys probably never heard of that, this is advanced stuff. Why if I jump north or south, I dont get dragged horizontally because of the angular momentum? I its because the Earth flat, and this proofs that the Earth is flat. Checkmate.   
If you guys change your minds about this dumb theory, I can send the link of the video for you, it was made from a very smart guy, he wears a white jacket, drinks coffee and says smart things like refractional inverted density, that must proof the Earth is flat.

1qy2jdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qy2jdo/after_hours/,After Hours,"The warehouse was silent, save for the low hum of the monitors and the occasional deep creak in the walls, like the building itself was exhaling. I took another sip from my fifth cup of black coffee that evening, feeling the bitterness coat my tongue.

My eyelids were heavy, and I was just about to sink deeper into the swivel chair for a quick nap when my phone suddenly buzzed on the table, the sharp sound cutting through the quiet and jolting me upright.

It was a message from my brother, Jamie.

_Hey, you still up?_

I yawned and rubbed my eyes, the screen’s glare making them sting. My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a second before I typed back a quick reply: _Got the night shift again. What’s up?_

A few seconds passed as I stared at the blinking cursor, the soft buzz of the monitors filling the silence around me. The warehouse sat next to the only supermarket in town, a squat, grey building that most people barely noticed.

It wasn’t much to look at. Just rows of metal shelves stacked with boxes of cereal, bottled drinks, cleaning supplies, and whatever else the supermarket didn’t have room for out front. I’d been working there for about a year and a half, mostly during the night shift.

It wasn’t the most exciting job, but it paid the bills, and I didn’t have to deal with customers or chatter. Just me, the shelves, and the occasional rats that scurried behind the pallets.

During the day, the place was busy. Workers hauling boxes in and out, checking inventory, logging deliveries, and preparing shipments for the store floor. But at night, things slowed to a crawl.

The supermarket closed at ten, and once the last delivery truck was gone, the silence would set in. My job was mostly to keep an eye on the CCTV feeds, make sure no one tried to sneak in through the loading docks, and double-check that the power systems and refrigeration units were running properly.

Every couple of hours, I’d do a walk around the aisles, flashlight in hand, just to make sure nothing had fallen or leaked. Most nights were uneventful, long stretches of stillness broken only by the hum of the lights and the echo of my own footsteps.

ACCESS DENIED.

The mechanical woman’s voice from the entrance panel broke the silence, sharp and metallic, echoing faintly through the rows of shelves. I froze for a second. The sound bounced off the concrete walls in an oddly muffled way, like it didn’t belong there. I frowned and clicked to switch the front entrance camera to full screen.

Empty.

The loading bay outside looked the same as always. A stretch of bare concrete under harsh white lights, the security gate locked tight. Beyond that, the trees along the access road swayed gently in the wind, their shadows crawling across the pavement.

Nothing moved. No cars, no people, not even the usual stray cat that sometimes wandered near the dumpsters. Still, something about the silence felt heavier than before, as if the warehouse was holding its breath.

I shrugged and took another sip of my coffee. Probably just another glitch. The system acted up every now and then. Sometimes the sensor wouldn’t recognize your fingerprint at all no matter how many times you pressed your thumb against it. You’d have to wipe it clean, press again, curse a little, and hope it finally decided to cooperate.

During the day, the roll-up gate usually stayed open, with employees coming and going as they loaded stock or moved deliveries to the store. But at night, it was different. 

Once the last truck left and the supermarket lights went out, the gate came down and locked tight. After that, the only way in was through the small metal door, which could only be opened using the fingerprint panel.

I pulled the office door open and walked over to the rusty metal railing, leaning forward to peer down into the darkness below.

“Hello?”

My voice echoed through the warehouse, thin and warped, distorted in a way that made it sound wrong. Almost unfamiliar. I frowned, but brushed it off. The building was old anyway. Old buildings creaked, groaned, and did weird things all the time.

I turned back toward the door, grabbed the handle and pushed. It didn’t move. I tried again, lifting it slightly before shoving harder. Nothing. Still stuck. Fuck. First the fingerprint scanner, now this. I muttered under my breath and jiggled the handle, irritation creeping into my chest as I put my weight against it. The door refused to budge.

I leaned closer and tapped my forehead lightly against the small rectangular glass window, once, then again and again, feeling really stupid. The glass was colder than I expected. 

I pulled back quickly, unsettled by a strange, fleeting thought that someone might be pressing back from the other side. I shook it off. What the hell? Maybe I’d have to jimmy it open

I took a deep breath and forced myself to calm down, then wrapped my hand around the handle again and twisted it sharply in one precise motion. Click. The door swung open. 

For just a second, I caught my reflection in the glass. It looked distorted, stretched wrong by the angle and the light. My face looked exhausted. Sad, somehow. Jesus. I really did need some time off work.

I flipped through the logbook lazily until I found the last entry. Grabbing a pen, I jotted down a quick note about the entrance panel glitch and the stupid door being stuck on a fresh page, just enough detail so the morning shift could pass it along to the IT department. No point making a big deal out of it. Stuff like this happened all the time.

Then I sat down and clicked through the monitors until I found the one showing the cold room readings. All the temperature indicators were still steady, glowing a faint green across the screen. Good. At least that part of the system was behaving tonight.

It was just one of those long, sleepy nights where time seemed to crawl. The hum of the refrigeration units filled the background like white noise, and the only thing keeping me awake was the caffeine still lingering in my veins. A few more hours, I told myself. Just hang on until morning comes then I can clock out, and head home.

I was just about to lean back and let myself relax for a bit when it started again.

ACCESS DENIED.

The robotic voice cut through the silence, echoing faintly through the aisles. It sounded distant this time, like it was coming from somewhere deep inside the building, or maybe just bouncing weirdly off the concrete walls.

“What the fuck…” I muttered, fumbling for the mouse. I clicked over to the entrance camera again. Still empty. Exactly like before.

I refreshed the feed a few times, watching the seconds tick in the corner of the screen just to make sure it was live. Nothing. The same stretch of pavement, the same still trees. Not a soul in sight.

A cold, prickling feeling crept up the back of my neck. I was about to stand up when my phone suddenly buzzed against the desk, the vibration loud in the quiet room. It skidded dangerously close to the edge before I snatched it up.

“Yes?” I answered lazily.

_“Hey, dipshit,”_ said my brother, his voice crackling through. _“Don’t fall asleep on me yet. Tell me you requested those days off.”_

“Nice to hear from you too. Actually… can you call me ba—”

_“Dude, come on. Oakenfell Forest tomorrow. Just like old times. I already picked up the tent and other stuff from that pricey camping rental place.”_

“Jesus, man, relax. Louie already signed off on my one-week leave yesterday.”

He let out a giddy laugh that was far too high-pitched for a grown man. My brother could be unbearable when he wanted something badly enough.

The truth was, I’d never been much of an outdoors person. Not like him. He thrived on dirt trails, campfires, and sleeping under open skies, while I preferred solid walls and a reliable mattress.

Still, when we were kids, our father used to drag us into the wilderness for a few nights at a time. We’d sleep beneath a sprawl of stars, far from the noise of town, wrapped in that deep, almost sacred silence you only find in the wilderness.

Then we grew up. Work schedules, bills, and adult obligations pulled us in different directions, and those small escapes into the wild slowly disappeared.

After Dad passed away a few years ago, my brother made me promise we’d keep the tradition alive, just the two of us, a few nights outdoors every now and then, in his honor. The problem was our lives rarely aligned. For months, he’d been nagging me to request time off so we could finally go camping again.

_“Did you ask your friend if you could borrow his camera?”_ he went on.

“Yes,” I replied, already losing patience. “I’ll swing by Jerry’s place later and pick it up on my way to yours. Happy now?”

_“You better,”_ he said. _“I’m not doing this hike solo again. You bail, I’m hiking Blue Hill and spreading your ashes in a deer’s poo.”_

“Relax. I wanna go. Seriously. I need to get outta here for a few days anyway. This place is like… weird.”

I could hear him yawn on the other end.

_“Bet it’s creepy as hell at night.”_

“It’s not that bad,” I said, glancing at the screens.”

_“You should bring a Ouija board. Summon some ghosts. Spice things up.”_

“Why are you so hell-bent on going there, anyway?” I asked.

He let out a small, excited chuckle.

_“Dad went camping in Oakenfell Forest once, said it was beautiful but he never went back. He wanted to, though.”_

I frowned, staring absently at the floor as a vague memory surfaced.

“Wait… did you say Oakenfell Forest? Isn’t that where a group of hikers went missing a few years ago?”

I turned to my computer. The screen glowed to life as my fingers hovered over the keyboard. I quickly typed ‘Oakenfell Forest Incident’ into the search bar and hit enter.

“Oh, this doesn’t sound good,” I muttered, scrolling through the results. “It says here they went missing under mysterious circumstances. Some of their backpacks, jackets, and shoes were found scattered around the cliffside.” 

_”Yeah yeah yeah. Creepy stuff.”_

I clicked on one of the articles and skimmed it.

“But strangely enough, none of them have ever been found. Dead or alive.” I leaned back in my chair, phone wedged between my shoulder and ear as I continued reading aloud. “Search parties, helicopters, the whole thing. Nothing. They just… vanished.”

My brother scoffed audibly.

_“People disappear under mysterious circumstances everywhere, every day. That doesn’t mean anything.”_

“We could be them,” I said grimly, only half joking.

_“Don’t be such a buzzkill, asshole.”_

“I’m serious,” I said, ignoring him as I clicked on the next article. The page took a moment to load, then filled with another wall of text and grainy photographs. “Those hikers weren’t the only ones.”

He let out an exaggerated groan through the phone. I could hear him chewing loudly on the other end.

“Are you eating right now?”

_“Chips,”_ he said. _“Continue your ghost story.”_

“Listen,” I insisted, leaning closer to the screen. “It says here there’s been a string of other creepy disappearances… Not just recently.”

_“Here we go.”_

I scrolled down, skimming through paragraphs of dates and names.

“Some of these cases go way back. Long before it even became an official camping site.”

A brief silence hung on the line.

_“You really know how to sell a vacation, you know that?”_ He said. _“You’ve been reading way too much Missing 411. That guy is a fra—”_

ACCESS DENIED.

_“—what was that?”_ Jamie asked.

“You heard that?” I asked, already on my feet, staring out at the dark aisles below.

_“Uh. Yeah.”_

I rubbed my forehead. “Someone tried to get in. Biometric reader went off. Probably a glitch. Hang on.”

My fingers trembled as I opened the system log. Same fingerprint attempt. No match.

_“Someone’s out there?”_ he asked.

“No,” I muttered quickly, eyes fixed on the feed. “Camera’s empty. No movement. It’s probably just acting up again.”

I didn’t entirely believe it, though. The voice still echoed faintly in my head, like it was coming from somewhere far inside the warehouse.

_“Maybe it’s a raccoon,”_ he joked. _“A very determined, very tech-savvy raccoon.”_

“Shut up.”

ACCESS DENIED.

_“Still happening?”_ Jamie asked, his voice tightening just a little.

“Yeah. Feels... off.”

I refreshed the feed. Nothing changed. Still no one at the entrance. No flicker. No movement. Just the sound of that damn voice.

_“Maybe someone forgot their ID or something,”_ Jamie said.

“Nobody’s supposed to be coming in this late,” I muttered, frowning at the timestamp in the corner of the screen. “And there’s nobody at the entrance. It’s fucking empty!”

_“What time is it?”_

“Almost two.”

There was a brief pause on the line.

_“Welp. That’s not unsettling at all.”_

I didn’t answer. The hum of the monitors suddenly felt louder, like the warehouse itself was listening.

I stood up and walked a slow circle around the office, trying to shake off the tension building in my shoulders. Through the glass walls, I could see the entire warehouse below. Rows and rows of shelves stacked high with boxes and crates, forming a maze of shadowy aisles that seemed to go on forever.

I reached over to the control panel and flipped on the overhead lights, one section at a time. With a low hum, the fluorescents flickered to life across the warehouse. First near the loading bay, then the cold storage area, then the aisles farther back. Bright white light flooded every corner. Nothing moved. No figures. No sound beyond the distant buzz of electricity.

I leaned closer to the glass, scanning the floor carefully, half expecting to see someone or something ducking behind a pallet. But there was nothing. Just the endless stillness of a space that suddenly felt too large and too empty.

_“Okay,”_ Jamie said. _“So if this turns into, like, some found footage horror… shit like that, what’s the protocol? You hide behind a forklift?”_

“If I died and turned into a ghost, I’d haunt you for the rest of your life,” I told him.

He snorted.

_“You’d probably still show up for work the next night… and haunt that place. Took me years to get you to take even a few days off.”_

“I’ll call you back, okay? I’m just gonna check it out.”

_“Be careful, dude.”_

I hung up, slipped the phone into my pocket, and pushed open the office door. The metal stairs groaned under my sneakers as I made my way down, each step echoing through the empty space.

I’d left only a few of the overhead lamps on, so most of the warehouse was swallowed in shadow. The cold room lights cast long, yellow rectangles across the floor, stretching my shadow out toward the rows of shelves and the far wall on my left.

The air was cool and still, the faint hum of the refrigeration units filling the silence. I moved between two tall shelving racks, the narrow aisle amplifying the sound of my footsteps. The place always felt different at night.

I thought back to the shift handover earlier that evening. No one had said a word about the damn door acting up. I was sure of it.

As soon as I reached the small gray door, I grabbed the handle and pulled it open. A cool rush of night air hit my face, carrying with it the hum of cicadas buzzing somewhere out in the dark.

I zipped my jacket all the way up to my chin and stepped outside. The heavy metal door creaked softly as it swung shut behind me.

The parking lot stretched out quiet and still, bathed in patches of weak yellow light from the overhead lamps. My car sat near the chain-link fence in front of the warehouse, half-hidden in shadow. The old delivery truck was parked in its usual spot, way off in the far corner, where the light barely reached.

Everything looked the same as it always did.

I turned my head toward the supermarket next door. The building loomed over the lot, a flat gray slab of concrete and glass. Now and then, a car passed on the main road beyond it, headlights sliding across the facade and stretching long shadows over the wall.

Nothing moved. No raccoons. No cats. No stray dogs nosing around the bins. Just the faint hum of the floodlights and the chorus of insects in the trees beyond the fence. The air smelled faintly of dust, rain-soaked asphalt, and something metallic drifting from the warehouse vents.

I rubbed the back of my neck, trying to shake off the tension crawling under my skin. I reached into my pocket and pulled out a cigarette. The first drag steadied me. The ember glowed faint orange against the dark, the smoke curling lazily up into the night.

Might as well have one, I thought. No way I was going back in there yet. Not until I checked what the fuck was wrong with that damned fingerprint scanner.

Everything seemed quiet and empty, yet I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Across the lot, the supermarket’s upper windows reflected the amber glow of the streetlamps. Empty, still, like a row of watchful eyes staring down at me.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I pulled it out and glanced at the screen. Another text from Jamie.

_So?_

I thumbed back a quick reply: _Nothing. Just a glitch. Out for a quick smoke._

Sent it, shoved the phone back into my pocket, and took another long drag. The night stayed perfectly still. Only the faint hiss of the cigarette and the hum of the lights kept me company.

After a few minutes of staring at the deserted parking lot, I flicked my second cigarette onto the asphalt and watched the tiny ember roll a few inches before dying out. My fingers were starting to go numb from the cold. I told myself I’d stalled long enough.

I slipped the pack of cigarettes back into my pocket and started walking toward the door. The warehouse was dead silent except for the faint echo of my footsteps against the concrete. 

When I reached the small metal door, I frowned at the fingerprint scanner. The little monitor glowed its usual dull blue, flickering slightly like it was tired of doing its job.

I pressed my finger lightly against the sensor.

ACCESS DENIED

I tried again, this time a little firmer.

ACCESS DENIED

I sighed under my breath.

“Piece of junk.”

ACCESS DENIED

The thing probably just needed a little encouragement. Maybe a smack or two.

ACCESS DENIED

I rubbed the cuff of my jacket hard against the scanner, brushing away a faint smudge of dust, and tried again.

ACCESS DENIED.

I let out a long, frustrated sigh and dug into my pocket, pulling out a tissue and scrubbing at the scanner with more force than necessary, like it had personally wronged me. Then…

ACCESS GRANTED

A soft click. I grabbed the handle and pushed the door open. The hinges groaned like they hadn’t been used in years, sending a faint echo across the empty warehouse. I stepped through cautiously, scanning the dim space ahead, and double-checked the lock behind me. A quick tug on the handle reassured me it was secure.

With a deep breath, I squared my shoulders and started back across the warehouse floor, each step feeling heavier than the last. The air inside felt cooler.

The faint hum from the cold room in the distance was barely audible, but it was there. A reminder that the building wasn’t completely dead. I climbed the metal stairs and slipped back into the small office upstairs.

I sank back into my chair and glanced at the monitor. 2:30 a.m. Still a few hours to go. I sighed and fished out my phone, typing a quick message to my brother: _Still up, loser?_

I took a sip of my cold coffee, and out of habit, checked the cold room readings on the screen again for what had to be the tenth time tonight. Everything looked fine.

My phone buzzed.

_Barely. So was it a ghost?_

_You wish_, I typed back. _Told you, it was just the fingerprint scanner acting up again._

I yawned, set the phone down, and clicked on another browser tab. YouTube loaded up, and I scrolled until I found my favorite travel channel. Some guy hiking through frozen mountain passes somewhere in Norway. Might as well let someone else’s adventure keep me awake for a bit.

A few minutes later, my phone lit up on the desk.

_Disappointing. TTYL. Going to bed soon._

I turned the volume down a little and switched on the closed captions before leaning back into my chair. My eyelids felt heavy despite the ridiculous amount of coffee I’d had that night. Once or twice, I would check the entrance camera, see nothing, and sink back down.

ACCESS DENIED

This is getting really annoying now, I thought, rubbing my eyes. Somebody better fix that damned panel first thing in the morning.

At some point after three, I was jolted awake by a silence so deep it almost felt solid. For a second, I just sat there, blinking stupidly, disoriented and unsure of where I was. Then the faint hum of the fluorescent lights brought me back to reality. I exhaled, stretched, and reached for my coffee, its surface cold and oily under the dim glow of the monitor.

ACCESS GRANTED.

I set the coffee down too fast, sloshing what was left across the desk, and fumbled for the mouse. The monitor flickered as I clicked into the entrance camera feed. The parking lot outside stared back at me. Empty, still, the same blank stretch of concrete under the white security lights.

My pulse quickened. I switched to the camera mounted on the ceiling above the gate.

The door swung open. Very slowly.

A faint, metallic creak echoed through the warehouse. Distant but unmistakable, bouncing off the concrete walls. I sucked in a sharp breath, my skin prickling. The live feed showed nothing. No figure. No shadow. Just the door, wide open to empty air.

I shot up from my chair and reached for the control panel, flipping the switch to turn on every section of overhead lighting. My eyes darted toward the warehouse below through the office glass.

Nothing.

For some reason, most of the lights stayed off. A few weak fluorescents flickered to life, casting long, trembling shadows across the aisles. The rest of the vast space remained drowned in dim yellow gloom.

Fuck.

I hesitated, then stepped out of the office and onto the top of the metal stairs. The iron groaned beneath my shoes as I looked down at the endless rows of shelves leading all the way to the entrance.

“Who’s there?” I called out, my voice rough, still half-asleep and shaking slightly.

Silence.

The kind that felt like it was listening back.

“Hello?” My voice sounded small against the vast, hollow space.

I went back into the office and yanked open the bottom drawer, pulling out the old flashlight we kept there for power outages. Its beam flickered weakly as I clicked it on, a dull yellow cone of light cutting through the dim warehouse gloom.

I swept it slowly across the shelves, the beam catching glints of shrink wrap, cardboard edges, metal rails, each one throwing strange, stretched-out shadows that seemed to move when I did.

But still nothing.

I drew a deep breath, ready to call out again, when a sound tore through the silence.

Footsteps.

Slow, deliberate footsteps coming from the far end of the aisle directly in front of the stairs.

I froze, my hand tightening around the flashlight. The beam wavered as I pointed it down the narrow corridor of shelves, swinging it back and forth. Nothing. Just empty space.

“Who’s there?” I called out again, my voice cracking somewhere between fear and exhaustion.

The footsteps grew faster. Closer. Echoing sharply against the concrete floor. My stomach turned cold. I stepped back without meaning to, eyes locked on the end of the aisle where the sound was coming from, waiting for something, anything, to appear.

Then, suddenly, the pace changed again. The footsteps broke into a sprint. Heavy, fast, pounding toward me.

“Shit!”

The noise slammed into the stairwell. Each metal step groaned and clanged under invisible weight, one after another, climbing. Closer and closer.

I dropped the flashlight. It hit the stairs with a harsh metallic clang and tumbled away, its beam spinning wildly before going dark.

Before I even realized what I was doing, I was already stumbling backward into the office. The door slammed shut with a metallic thud that echoed through the room, louder than I meant it to. My hands fumbled with the lock until it clicked into place.

I stood there for a second, chest heaving, trying to listen over the rush of blood in my ears. Then instinct took over. I backed away fast, nearly tripping over the chair, and pressed myself against the far wall. The cold plaster met my spine as I slid down, breath shallow and uneven, every muscle tensed.

For a moment, I didn’t dare move. It felt like the whole warehouse was listening, the air thick and heavy, holding its breath along with me.

My eyes stayed locked on the small rectangular glass pane set into the door. Every muscle in my body felt wired, tight with a mix of terror and raw anticipation. Whoever, or whatever had been climbing those stairs had to be standing just outside the office now. I could almost feel it on the other side, the way the air seemed to thicken and press inward. 

But when I forced myself to look, I saw nothing through the glass. Just the dim, empty stretch of the metal walkway outside, its surface catching the weak light from the overhead lamps.

I stood and took a few hesitant steps toward the door. My pulse thudded in my ears. I squinted through the narrow glass pane, scanning the dim corridor beyond. Nothing. The walkway lay empty, silent, and still as before.

My eyes flicked toward the computer screen on the desk. The wall of camera feeds flickered faintly. Rows of small blue-tinted images showing every corner of the warehouse. I leaned closer, my gaze sweeping over them one by one until it landed on the feed from the camera mounted just outside the office.

For a moment, I couldn’t process what I was seeing. The image showed the top of the stairs, the metal walkway, and the office door. This door. And something else. A shape. A figure standing perfectly still right in front of it.

My mouth went dry. I frowned, blinking hard, leaning in until my face was inches from the monitor. The outline was unmistakable: tall, motionless, human-shaped, but far too dark to be lit by the overhead lamps.

I cranked up the screen brightness and realized it was, in fact, a person. A man. He stood just beyond the office door, motionless beneath the dim exterior light. A gray parka hung loosely from his frame, the fabric torn in several places as though it had been snagged on branches or dragged across rough ground.

Dried mud caked his army pants, the dark, uneven stains streaking down the legs. Across the front of his jacket, blotches of something darker spread in irregular patches, soaking into the fabric in a way that made my stomach tighten.

There was something deeply wrong with his posture. One shoulder sagged noticeably lower than the other, causing his body to tilt at an unnatural angle. The corresponding arm bent inward across his stomach, twisted in a way no joint should allow. 

His head leaned forward and slightly to the side, as though it had been severed and clumsily set back in place without regard for alignment. Even his right leg jutted outward, crooked and unsteady, forcing his stance into a grotesque, off-balance shape.

His face appeared smeared with mud and what I guessed might have been blood, but the harsh overhead light behind him cast it in shadow on the monitor. From that angle, I couldn’t make out his features clearly.

I tore my eyes from the screen and looked back toward the door. Nothing. Just the faint reflection of my own pale face in the glass. Heart hammering, I turned back to the monitor. The figure hadn’t moved, but now it was closer, his head tilted downward, pressed against the glass pane as if trying to peer inside, his arms hung limply at its sides.

He was staring right at me.

Immediately I recoiled from the door, my eyes locked onto the little glass pane until my back hit the cold wall. Slowly, like I didn’t want to make a sound, I slid down into a crouch on the floor.

The metal handle began to jiggle, dipping down and then popping back up, each motion ending with a loud, metallic snap that made my heart slam against my ribs.

And then I heard it. A low, rasping cry seeped through the metal door. So faint and so full of pain that it made my chest tighten. It sounded like someone trying to speak through a crushed throat, each syllable dragged out with agonizing effort.

_“Hhheeeeeelpppp…”_

Every hair on my arms shot up at once. I grabbed the rolling office chair beside the desk and yanked it toward me, the wheels squealing softly across the floor. With trembling hands, I turned it so the back faced the door and shoved it against the frame like a poor-man’s barricade.

_“Yyyooouuuursss…”_

The word slithered through the thin gap beneath the door. I swallowed hard, my throat dry and tight. For a moment there was only silence. Heavy and suffocating. Then the voice returned, thinner this time. More strained. As if whatever stood outside had to force each sound through a ruined mouth.

_“Dddoooonnnttttttt…”_

The handle moved again, over and over… down, up, down, up… each time harder, each time with that same ugly snap, as if something on the other side were testing whether the door would give.

Thank God it didn’t. The bolt held. The door stayed shut and locked. I wrapped both hands around the armrests of the chair until my knuckles ached, every muscle ready to fling it at the door if it came to that. My breathing came in shallow, fast bursts.

I took a deep breath and snapped my head toward the computer screen just as a dull, heavy thud rattled through the room. My pulse surged. On the monitor, the figure was still there.

Right outside the door, its body rocking in a slow, unnatural rhythm. Then he lunged forward and slammed his head against the metal surface.

Thud.

The sound vibrated through the floor, sharp and metallic. I could almost feel it in my teeth.

Thud.

Again. Harder this time. The whole door trembled in its frame.

Thud.

Each impact came heavier than the last, his movements twitchy and desperate, like he wanted in. No matter how.

I crossed my arms tightly over my chest, bracing for whatever was about to break through that door, and squeezed my eyes shut. Every muscle in my body trembled as the pounding continued. Slow, steady, and maddening. I lost track of time crouched there on the cold floor, my back pressed hard against the wall, listening to the sound fade, then return, then fade again.

Eventually, exhaustion crept in. My body felt too heavy to move, and despite the fear still crawling under my skin, sleep dragged me under like a wave.

When I came to, there was a sound I didn’t register right away. Soft, rhythmic knocking. My eyes snapped open. For a second, I couldn’t remember where I was. The fluorescent lights hummed faintly overhead, and the monitors showed nothing but the usual static feeds of an empty warehouse.

I turned toward the door. A familiar face pressed against the glass pane, frowning, caught somewhere between confusion and anger. My stomach tightened. I scrambled to my feet, blinking hard, realizing how stiff my legs were from sleeping on the floor. My voice came out cracked and dry.

“Louie?”

He gestured impatiently for me to unlock the door.

“What the hell, man?” Louie barked the second I unlocked the door. He shoved it open, stepping inside with that half-angry, half-worried look he always got when something didn’t make sense.

His eyes darted around the office. The spilled coffee on the desk, the half-empty mug on the floor, the chair knocked slightly off-center. Then his gaze landed back on me.

“Uh, sorry. I fell asleep,” I muttered nervously.

“Were you drinking or something?” He looked me up and down, frowning.

“What? No! Of course not!” I shot back, rubbing the back of my neck.

“Why was the front door open?” he demanded, his voice rising. “I thought someone broke in. Scared the shit outta me when I saw it unlocked.”

I didn’t answer. My mind was still foggy, my heart pounding from the adrenaline spike. Instead, I stepped up to the office windows and leaned forward, scanning the aisles and long rows of shelves below.

Shadows stretched between the stacks, shifting slightly under the dim fluorescent lights, but everything looked empty.

I stepped back toward the desk, careful not to step in the sticky puddle of spilled coffee. My hands trembled slightly as I grabbed the mouse and pulled up the security footage from the night before. Clicking through the timestamps, my stomach sank as I watched the events unfold.

Nothing at first. The feeds were clean. Every camera angle looked perfectly normal. The parking lot, the aisles, the stairs. No figure. No movement. Nothing but the quiet, empty warehouse.

I checked the footage from the entrance camera first. The timestamp ran between one and three in the morning. There I was, walking out the front door, lighting a cigarette, pacing nervously across the empty parking lot.

A few minutes later, I returned to the small metal door and leaned down to check the fingerprint scanner. Everything matched what I remembered. Nothing seemed out of place.

Then I switched to the camera mounted inside the warehouse, right in front of the gate. That’s when my stomach dropped. The door, still closed, suddenly swung open. I froze, my hands gripping the edge of the desk.

Heart hammering, I clicked over to the camera near the top of the stairs. On-screen, I could see myself standing at the top, flashlight in hand, the weak beam slicing across the aisle below. My body froze, staring down toward the entrance like I’d just witnessed something impossible.

Then, without warning, I spun and bolted back into the office, disappearing out of frame. The flashlight slipped from my grip as I lunged for the door.

Seeing it all from multiple angles made it undeniable. Something had been out there, something I hadn’t been able to see with my own eyes. And it was closer than I ever wanted to imagine.

“What the hell was all that about?” Louie asked calmly from right behind me, arms crossed over his chest, his eyebrows raised.

“I…” I stammered, my throat dry. “The door security system… It's been acting up all night. The fingerprint scanner kept showing someone was trying to get in…”

I rubbed my face with both hands and let out a long, shaky sigh, trying to steady my racing heartbeat.

“And?” Louie pressed, leaning slightly forward. “Was anyone actually trying to get in?”

“No. As you can see for yourself. The door… it just opened by itself at one point. Probably a glitch.” I gestured toward the old leather-bound logbook sitting next to the keyboard. “I wrote everything down in the log for the morning shift.”

Louie shoved me lightly aside and started scrolling through the recorded footage from all the cameras. His eyes narrowed as he paused on the clip of me at the top of the stairs, flashlight beam cutting across the rows of shelves.

“What the hell happened here?” he asked, his voice quieter now, almost cautious.

“I…” My chest tightened, and I could feel my heart hammering in my ears as I tried to relive it. “… nothing.”

That was partly true. Nothing should have been out there. Nothing should have opened the door or triggered the scanner. And that was exactly what had terrified me.

“I should get going,” I finally said, my voice tight and a little unsteady. I bent over to grab some tissues and carefully wiped at the sticky mess I’d left on the desk and the floor.

Louie watched me, frowning.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

“I haven’t slept well, and my head is still spinning,” I added quickly, tossing the crumpled tissue into the trash bin next to the desk.

“So, you’re taking the week off starting today, right?” he asked again, picking up the logbook, eyes still on me, studying every move.

I just nodded, weakly.

“I’m not gonna write you a suspension this time for leaving the front door wide open all night,” he continued.

“But I did n—”

He held up a hand firmly. I swallowed my protest.

“That’s a huge no-no. If management finds out, you’ll be suspended immediately.”

I nodded again, gritting my teeth.

“Enjoy your time off. And make sure you’re back at work…” He glanced at the printed schedule pinned to the wall beside the computer. “…Friday night, next week.”

“I will,” I said, grabbing my small sling bag from the desk.

“And do me a favor, please.” His voice dropped a little, the tension in his expression easing. “Help yourself and get some rest. You look like crap. And try not to fall asleep on the job again… if you plan on keeping it. In this economy, you don’t want to stay unemployed for too long.”

Without another word, I walked out of the office. My body felt stiff and uncooperative, like it wasn’t entirely mine. My shoulder ached, my neck throbbed, and one leg dragged behind the others. I told myself it was just exhaustion.

After clocking out in a hurry, I started walking toward my car in the parking lot. The sun was already up, but thick clouds dulled the light, washing everything in a cold, gray-blue haze.

A low fog clung to the ground, and the morning air bit through my jacket as I crossed the lot. I could see dark storm clouds gathering in the distance.

I was about halfway to my car when something dark on the asphalt caught my eye.

At first, I thought it was just a damp patch, but then I noticed the shape. An uneven impression, smeared at the edges, like a shoe pressed through mud and left behind. There were a few more nearby, shallow and incomplete, fading as they crossed the lot.

One of them sat wrong, turned slightly outward, as if whoever had made it hadn’t been walking straight. My stomach tightened as I followed the marks with my eyes. They led toward the warehouse entrance, stopping right in front of the door.

Frowning, I traced the trail the other way. The prints grew darker, muddier, and sharper as I went, until they ended right beside my car. At the driver’s side door.

For a moment, I just stood there, the cold seeping through my shoes, a strange pressure settling in my chest.

I had the sudden, irrational urge to turn around, to go back inside and tell Louie exactly what had happened, what I had seen, and how it had terrified me.

But my phone buzzed in my pocket. I winced as I pulled it out. It was a text from my brother, asking if I was ready to hit the road to Oakenfell Forest. I thumbed a short reply, slid into the driver’s seat, and started the engine. I never looked back.",1,1770433782.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1qy2jcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1qy2jcw/auntie_sex_story/,Auntie sex story,"For three months with my nudist aunt, shame turned into raw hunger. She paraded naked, opened my shower door, teased “Am I packed?” until I croaked “You look fucking sexy.” She smirked “Good taste” and left me rock-hard. Soon we were skin-to-skin under blankets—her fat tits smashed against my chest, nipples dragging across me, her hand slipping down to jerk my cock slow and sloppy a few times, then pulling away with a filthy little laugh.

One drunk movie night she came home, stripped, yanked me under the blanket naked. Her ass pressed right into my dick, grinding lazy circles while she “adjusted,” her wet pussy lips brushing my shaft through the thin space between us. She was plastered, breathing heavy whiskey on my neck, hand reaching back to stroke me hard until I was leaking on her thigh—then she just passed out spooned tight against me, ass still nestled on my cock all night.

We’ve fucked a few times since—raw, filthy sessions when the house is empty. She rides me deep, nails clawing my chest, moaning like a slut while I pound her from behind, her ass rippling with every thrust. No shame, no guilt—just dripping cum and her smirking over coffee the next morning like it’s our dirty little normal. It’s gonna happen again the second we’re alone and horny; the tension never really fades. ",0,1770433781.0,confessions,1,0.22,False

1qy2eme,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1qy2eme/the_bahama_project_an_original_superhero_universe/,THE BAHAMA PROJECT — An Original Superhero Universe Inspired by My Hero Academia (Long Read) PT 1: The Story,"Hey everyone I’ve been creating my own superhero universe for the past year or so and I really wanted to share it with an online community that enjoys deep lore and original worlds so this post is detailing my superhero universe called “The Bahama Project” the name originated from an early acronym BMHAU which stood for my name (kept anonymous) my hero academia universe which I later realized sounded a lot like Bahama so I reworked it into something that felt cleaner and more intentional this universe follows a similar premise to my hero academia which is one of my favorite anime where teen heroes attend a top ranking school and fight villains along the way however the Bahama Project expands far beyond that foundation focusing on celebrity heroes moral corruption psychological consequences villain ecosystems and the long term fallout of power abuse this post is written as a long timeline style summary of the major plot points rather than chapters or prose and while it may not cover every small day to day detail some of which only exist in personal notes it does cover the core arcs of the universe there is also a full character list at the bottom of the post with short descriptions so feel free to leave comments feedback or suggestions and I’ll do my best to reply and thank anyone who takes the time to read this so without further ado here is The Bahama Project.

So the story begins with 20 students being inducted into the academy of heroism and valor or AHV for short these hero’s include Afterburner, Bubble, Cloud jumper, Conductor, Demon king, Dj slide, Forge, Inferno, Lone wolf, Mach one, Meka, Metalhead, Nekyo, Nightmare, Quirk breaker, Rangeress, Slushee, Sting, Sunny, Swap. They heros are a part of alpha squadron the most elite class at the school and in the country of Japan where the story is set alpha squadrons main teacher is a hero names sarge there are also 4 other squadrons beta, charlie, echo (entrepreneur) and sigma (support) these squadrons aren’t fleshed out yet except for three characters in sigma firewall, Widowmaker, and demon hunter. There is also the AHV staff made up of the heroes Hawk, Screenslash, The doc, Scythe, Bass drop, Anaballistic\*\*.\*\* The students start of the school year getting to know their classmates and start their hero training until a tragic accident a powerful villain attacks Charlie squadron while they were on a mission slaughtering them all this throws AHV into disarray AHV puts out a public statement pledging their utmost condolences to the families of lost students and promising the safety of the remaining students this puts all the students on lockdown trapped in their dorms and training inside no missions allowed during this lockdown two of the students fall for each other sunny and slushee their relationship begins when slushee accidentally walks in on sunny after he had gotten out of the shower fully covered by a towel she apologizes profusely to him and he forgives her saying it’s no big deal then she talks about how much she stinks from training and he compliments her saying she doesn’t smell bad but sweet and she blushes and thanks him then she blurts out I have a crush on you and quickly covers her mouth and say sorry I thought we were just blurting out the truth and he says no it’s okay I like you too do you maybe want to get coffee sometime at this place I really like and she says yes then they sit in awkward silence for a bit before sunny says well I’ll see you in training tomorrow then slushee says the same but all of the students have trouble sleeping staying up in their rooms doing unique things to help calm their nerves the next day slushee tells all the girls and while the boys are left guessing what happened though they eventually figure it out and it becomes the talk of the class later the villian posts a public announcement that broadcasts to all the big screens in the city with a metallic voice speaking saying that he is armory leader of the Coalition Of Villainy composed of the villians Armory, Mute, Overdrive, Technomancer, Split, Shade, Lights out with the knowledge of who their enemies are AHV lifts the lockdown with caution though on alphas first mission armory attacks appearing on a rooftop Mach one unloads his entire arsenal on armory and he is unfazed so alpha retreats and when they leave so does armory then alpha fights COV when they plan a strategic strike at AHV they  are fended off by all the heroes but it still leaves the students rattled but now they know more of information about their enemy during this time they also fight many villians of the week or vows such as Madhouse, The juggernaut aka the jugg, shokushu-ma, Blitz, Payload, Spectre, Halucigen, Feedback, DR!FT, The hunter, echohounds these give the heros valuable training which they would need for armory attacks a city almost holding it hostage alpha squadron goes to fight but this time they aren’t backing down they fight armory and COV in a devastating battle that leaves a wake of destruction after a long conflict alpha comes out on top leaving armory deceased which AHV begins to study armory’s body and his nanites but one day as forge is walking to school he sees a bank heist happening and decides to intervene things are going well he’s saved all the hostages but then a round from the robbers experimental gun hits him and he loses his power for a short duration which allows the crooks to get away AHV and the police investigate the scene and find one of the weapons left behind firewall identifies it as a weapon created by the terrorist group The Movement who believe that quirks should be used as tools to help society not for flashy battles and celebrities most of their members being non enhanced while their top tier officers or lieutenants have quirks which are  Slicer, Magdump, Demo, Oxide, Bio the same day armory’s body disappears the heros go to the shining ruby club looking for answers a place where heroes are not welcome they talk to a few people and some contacts and figure out it was IQ the leader of the movement who took armory’s body little do they know he’s studying it for his project the heros then have to deal with the unnamed ground assault drone or UGAD a Russian military experiment gone wrong that is wreaking havoc in Japan alpha squadron along with the help of Russian hero’s hammer and sickle defeat UGAD alpha thanks the heros for their aid and the Russian heroes do the same then they return to Russia but tell alpha to contact them again if they ever need help alpha then recovers UGAD’s brain which holds all its memories and passes it on to firewall who takes days to hack into UGAD memories but when she does she finds something horrifying and shows alpha a log showing Russian scientist studying alien creatures  when they watch the last one they’re horrified as the alien escaped and killed all of the scientists which was horrifying for alpha to watch so swap made firewall shut it off before more harm could be done seeing how tight slushee was into Sunny’s chest and seeing the rest of the team obviously frightened firewall finds that there is a tracker in the alien and they find its name saved as the hunter and other creatures named echohounds that are controlled by the hunter so they track him down finding him in a crashed alien spaceship they split up and start to wonder who’s hunting who they fight off multiple echohounds eventually finding the hunter who puts up a good fight before he is punched into the ships electric panels and him and his armor get fried alive alpga reports this back to AHV what they found and they get a relaxed bit and a new student EV who is a good hero and afterburner falls for her and they start to date until she betrays them revealing her true self the daughter of IQ a member of the movement she blows up an essential communication tower at AHV but before she can call the rest of the movement troops afterburner fueled by his rage from the betrayal goes into quirk overdrive meaning his quirk has reached its most powerful form he attacks EV and before she even know what happens she is on the ground in critical condition and afterburner asks her was any of it real and she responds we were we always were and then they both pass out and they both are put into the hospital then afterburner suddenly wakes up with Mach one by his side and they talk and he asks where EV is and he won’t tell him and says he’s been out for a week and he takes off all his medical sensors and charges into the main communal space and everyone is surprised he’s up but he charges right past them and asks sarge where EV is sarge holds his ground for some time before telling him she’s at a criminal rehabilitation hospital and that alpha worked to get her sentence reduced to rehabilitation instead of jail time since she was only following her fathers orders so he goes to see her and she’s awake he can only see her behind glass for now but she apologizes and cries so much but he says he understands she was raised by her dad his opinion was the only one she knew and he overreacted because he was hurt but now with time to think he forgives her and so he says that he promises he’ll come see her every week and he keeps his promise and eventually she is allowed to have out of facility hours with him and so their relationship flowers though is sometimes judged but not by alpha members alpha finally gets some downtime to study and fight some more VOWs then they are invited to a ball where world leaders have gathered after a meeting where quirk laws were discussed the conclusion of this meeting displeased the movement so they sent slicer and magdump to assassinate as many leaders as possible their plan was foiled by alpha and they only managed to graze one of the attendees after that the blaze boys a band whose members are afterburner as lead singer, Mach one as bass, metal head as lead guitar, demon king as drummer and inferno as pyrotechnics and back up guitar and they go to the loudest hours: amp it up competition where they go up against  k-pop group named neons who’s members are star as the lead, shimmer, and dazzle they instantly win over the crowd and become overnight sensations but something isn’t right and it turns out they have music based quirks that when they sing together makes people obsessed with them even making them go to lengths that injure themselves to get close to neon and so the blaze boys expose them and then neon comes for the blaze boys and they fight and the blaze boys come out on top leaving neon at rock bottom and arrested for illegal quirk use then they most important event of the AHV winter gala a place where AHV’s students get to talk to professional heros and hero agency’s in hope that they someday work their it’s also a chance for the Charlie and sigma squadron to talk to companies related to their work and it’s an extravagant party where all AHV students get paired with a designer and they can have a group of people paired with one designer like the blaze boys all shared a designer sunny and slushee shards and afterburner and EV who was in attendance shared a designer but just as the party was supposed to end and the after party begin the private security force that was hired for the even turned on them using movement weapons because they were actually undercover movement operatives but overhead they hear the sound of chopper blades and then the glass roof breaks soldiers drop down and silenced shots ring out leaving all of the movement members deceased these soldiers clean up their work and the party ends but after this shocking even the students at AHV don’t let it ruin their night and the crazy after party begins with flashing lights and everything else and the blaze boys specifically afterburner plays a song for EV who’s dress lights up during the song and so the students have an amazing night to remembers but a few days later a new enemy arises a suited movement operative know as Widowmaker appears murdering hero’s then his sworn enemy a vigilante known as demon hunter eventually firewall figures out both of their identities to be sigma squadron students and so Widowmaker captures her though alpha comes and saves her but Widowmaker was not going down without a fight and for his last stand he detonates the abandoned warehouse they are in but alphas heroes protect each other and firewall though this still have some skirmishes with the demon hunter disagreeing with some of his vigilante work but the movement isn’t done yet IQ is finally done with his latest creation project reborn all of armory’s nanites but non of the human error along with telekinesis and fingertip laser beam powers he seems unstoppable and so alpha fights him many times sometimes winning sometimes losing but noticing that sometimes it seems almost like they’re fighting armory himself and not a robot and eventually in a big fight project reborn is reveal that armory never went away and lives inside the robot after some combat project reforged infects inferior creating armory reborn with all 4 quirks fire gaze, nanotech armory, fingertip lasers and Telekinesis and along with the COV’s help armory reborn forces the hero’s to retreat and begins wreaking havoc on a city making it a burning destroyed battle ground alpha goes back to AHV to regroup and they do and create a plan to stop armory reborn and so they fly to the city drop in from the sky and an epic battle ensues it seems as though it’s in a stalemate but a piece of inferno slips through alpha tells him to fight it and so he does armory reborn burns from the inside lighting up a bright orange and eventually in a blinding flash armory’s nanites are gone but inferno payed the ultimate price alpha finds him charred an coughing leaning up against a fallen pillar but their is nothing they can do and slowly the flame inside of inferno fades and fizzles away leaving alpha incomplete and so a funeral is held to honor a great hero at the funeral conductor meets a man who claims to be a friend of inferno with a beautiful smile they spend time together at the funeral and even dance and he asks if she would want to go out again some time and this relationship grows in conductors free time while alpha fights villains every day though eventually he reveals his true colors he is EVs younger brother his existence kept a secret from her for her whole life her always overshadowing him and he’s here for revenge his name being Mr nobody suddenly movement members appear and conductor is capture and brought to a movement facility and so alpha launches a rescue mission and saves conductor from mr nobody evil clutches the hero’s return to the ruby club to find more information about the whereabouts of IQ but that isn’t the only thing they discovered afterburner discovers the underground fight ring the shockers fight club which his brother is the leader and champion of despite his older brother telling him not to get involved his brother aftershock trained and beat the previous champion maho to become the best he gets into a little spar with his brother proving he’s still better than him and even though he wont change his mind afterburner still cares for him so after alpha finds IQ he takes his exoskeleton suit and fights alpha head on and he puts up an tremendous fight for not having a combat quirk but eventually after a long tedious battle he is killed and alpha leaves sad about the loss of life but knowing it was a sacrifice worth the lives it saved eventually Mr nobody finds his father and he becomes the leader of the movement fixing his fathers broken mask with the art of Kintsugi and the movement is quite for a while and alpha fights the villain group fear a horrifying group made up of the villains clown, mask, monster, doll they end up in a forest and fight in what is a real life horror movie and like most horror movies they escape the killer villains and defeat them but after that they get a new Teamate vida meurta who joins them on a mission an decides to stay and he is well needed as alpha goes up against the Seven deadly sings seven famous team hero’s popularized by airwaves media and enhance with a substance of his creating turning them from b-c tier hero’s to a tier hero’s thought they have the power they do lack experience and teamwork and so when confronted by alpha this is their downfall even when enhancing themselves past all limits turning them into powerful monsters and they were eventually put in rehab after dealing with the loss of most of their power and so now alpha is determined to take down airwave but before they can do that they meet someone Xander the creator of the world a god who gave his powers to the humans so they too could be powerful and he wants them to join his army but they refuse protecting earth so with his godly powers he starts his conquest capturing most of Japan before alpha squadron stops him defeating his army and sending him back to where he came from and so the eventful first year of the students of alpha squadron comes to an end but the story does not as later ins their second year a they discover that inferno is still alive reborn by a AHV program that was eventually forgotten and when delta when to recover him he awoke and escape eventually going and becoming the leader of a group called the order of the sacred flame who’s prophecy claims a reborn phoenix with come in the form of their god and so with ash the second in command at his side he leads this order hoping to take down the corruption in AHV wondering how many other heroes they could have done this to but inferno invites his old band mates to dinner where it is revealed that the program left him with a different personality made of pure rage that he can not control while ash made him medicine that helps him come out for a short period of time and it is revealed that they are in love so alpha and inferno work together to expose the corruption inside the superhero world and to prevent him from causing a war between AHV and the order and so eventually they find inferno a permanent cure and he rejoins the team still skeptical of AHV but knowing that they have rooted out most if not all of the corruption but their biggest enemy is yet to come a time traveling version of armory who comes from a world where he has capture the entire universe and plans to do the same to the entire multiverse and so the war begins japan is throw into an a war with armory who create factory to produce his robots and so alpha along with the help of other heroes and civilian rebellions wage war on armory and eventually stop his multiverse ending plot and so proving that they have grown into the true heroes they were meant to be Japan is rebuilt and unfortunately here is where so far the story ends thank you for taking the time to read it.

1qy2ecb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1qy2ecb/ruined_it_with_godly_man/,Ruined it with Godly man,"Hi everyone,

I met a man who was basically everything I've ever prayed for, and messed it up within the first three dates. He's intellectual, so curious, Godly, and incredibly kindhearted. It's the first time I've ever met a man I could see a future with, found attractive and intellectually stimulating, and that actively pursued me. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for having messed it up.

Two weeks ago at our catechism group, after I asked a question during the discussion, he sought me out, we spent 20 minutes discussing, and got really deep on an important faith topic. During the whole conversation he was incredibly engaged and was asking incredible follow up questions that made me think in ways I normally wouldn't. I could tell just by speaking to him that he was an intelligent person, and humble enough to listen and contemplate what the other person says before speaking. He's so knowledgeable in the faith and I could see his love for the Lord.

Last week I was studying at our uni, and he somehow saw me and decided to talk to me. We really hit it off, and he asked me out. The next day he planned the date and we were going to visit a saint's tomb and get coffee afterwards. I really appreciated how forward he was and how he pursued me. He came up to me and he planned the date the day after. It felt like a dream come true.

I ended up getting a free ticket for a hike the next day, and we did that instead of the coffee+tomb date. We hiked for 8h and it went very well. He showed really good leadership at the start of the hike by taking it upon himself to speak with the front desk clerk while I went to the bathroom, and when I came back he had chosen the perfect hike for us. I'm normally very independent and untrusting but felt comfortable submitting to his leadership and competence. On the hike we spoke about so many topics and I find him fascinating and saw so many future life alignment points. We did the rosary together. We were throwing each other in the snow. I was so happy.

He planned a coffee study date two days later, which is when things turned south (or so I'm assuming). The coffee and study part itself was great, but afterwards when I walked him to his class I started speaking absolute nonsense. My family has some really messed up inside jokes, that honestly should not be said out loud because of how insulting and insensitive they are to an outside eye. He asked what makes me laugh the most in the world, and I said our family's inside jokes. So I proceeded to tell him one and he laughed. He left soon after to go to his class, and I was mentally slapping myself but thought it wouldn't be the end of the world.

Two days later, yesterday, he drove me to the catechism group and there were no problems as far as I'm aware that day. At least I don't think I did or said anything particularly repulsive. I told him at the end to text me when he wanted to see each other again and he smiled and said ok. I texted him that night to see if he wanted to study today, since I realized he's initiated everything else so maybe I should this time, and he said he was busy.

Today I get a text saying: He's thought a lot about the time we spent together, and he isn't interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with me. He's happy about the time we spent together and hopes I won't take it badly.

Basically I'm taking it quite badly and have been replaying every conversation and everything I did. And the only two things I can think about is the really really bad family joke I absolutely should not have said, and a slightly discriminating comment I said about a boy in my class.

I'm completely devastated because I don't understand what possessed me to say these things to him, when I would never to any of my other friends. These things really misrepresent the person I am and I normally have a much better filter.

To give more context as to why I feel like I've just lost out on the possibly best man I'll ever meet:

\- He's studying engineering and genuinely understands every part of every course he's taken. He was talking to me about how some of the physics formulas were derived. No normal person cares about how the cosine formula came to be, he's genuinely so intelligent and curious

\- He's so far in his faith journey and the steps he's taken to be stronger in his faith really inspires me

\- He wants a family and he has a very good view of love and a christian marriage, which aligns exactly with what I want. He dates to marry, like me

\- He's so curious about everything and asks such good questions. He was so interested in everything about my life, any and every subject to exist, and was asking so many things I've never even thought about

\- He has goals in life and actively works towards them. I have so much genuine respect and admiration for him

\- He studies philosophy/literature on the side of his engineering studies to not be too one-dimensional

\- He's very attractive

\- He has the voice of an angel

\- He actively pursued me

I've always known I was anxiously attached, and it's something I've tried working on by becoming more secure in myself. I thought I was better, but clearly not, since after he asked me out I was constantly talking/thinking about him, and fully thought nothing would stop us from entering a long term relationship, and eventually get married. I controlled myself in not texting him and not letting it show, but I definitely was feeling the anxious attachment in the way I was thinking. Now, despite having only been seeing him for a week, I feel like my heart's been ripped out and I've ruined the perfect opportunity for a Godly relationship that God put right in front of me.

How can I get over this? I don't think I'll ever meet someone as good as him again, and I'm so sad to have messed up our connection over not being able to shut my mouth on things I would normally never say. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for having lost him. I so badly want to beg him to give me another chance.

TL;DR : Perfect Godly man came into my life. I said offensive and insensitive things. He doesn't want me. Devastated. Don't know how to forgive myself and move on",1,1770433386.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

He's so knowledgeable in the faith and I could see his love for the Lord.

  
Last week I was studying at our uni, and he somehow saw me and decided to talk to me. We really hit it off, and he asked me out. The next day he planned the date and we were going to visit a saint's tomb and get coffee afterwards. I really appreciated how forward he was and how he pursued me. He came up to me and he planned the date the day after. It felt like a dream come true.

  
I ended up getting a free ticket for a hike the next day, and we did that instead of the coffee+tomb date. We hiked for 8h and it went very well. He showed really good leadership at the start of the hike by taking it upon himself to speak with the front desk clerk while I went to the bathroom, and when I came back he had chosen the perfect hike for us. I'm normally very independent and untrusting but felt comfortable submitting to his leadership and competence. On the hike we spoke about so many topics and I find him fascinating and saw so many future life alignment points. We did the rosary together. We were throwing each other in the snow. I was so happy.

  
He planned a coffee study date two days later, which is when things turned south (or so I'm assuming). The coffee and study part itself was great, but afterwards when I walked him to his class I started speaking absolute nonsense. My family has some really messed up inside jokes, that honestly should not be said out loud because of how insulting and insensitive they are to an outside eye. He asked what makes me laugh the most in the world, and I said our family's inside jokes. So I proceeded to tell him one and he laughed. He left soon after to go to his class, and I was mentally slapping myself but thought it wouldn't be the end of the world.

  
Two days later, yesterday, he drove me to the catechism group and there were no problems as far as I'm aware that day. At least I don't think I did or said anything particularly repulsive. I told him at the end to text me when he wanted to see each other again and he smiled and said ok. I texted him that night to see if he wanted to study today, since I realized he's initiated everything else so maybe I should this time, and he said he was busy.

  
Today I get a text saying: He's thought a lot about the time we spent together, and he isn't interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with me. He's happy about the time we spent together and hopes I won't take it badly.

  
Basically I'm taking it quite badly and have been replaying every conversation and everything I did. And the only two things I can think about is the really really bad family joke I absolutely should not have said, and a slightly discriminating comment I said about a boy in my class.

I'm completely devastated because I don't understand what possessed me to say these things to him, when I would never to any of my other friends. These things really misrepresent the person I am and I normally have a much better filter. 

  
To give more context as to why I feel like I've just lost out on the possibly best man I'll ever meet:

\- He's studying engineering and genuinely understands every part of every course he's taken. He was talking to me about how some of the physics formulas were derived. No normal person cares about how the cosine formula came to be, he's genuinely so intelligent and curious

\- He's so far in his faith journey and the steps he's taken to be stronger in his faith really inspires me 

\- He wants a family and he has a very good view of love and a christian marriage, which aligns exactly with what I want. He dates to marry, like me

\- He's so curious about everything and asks such good questions. He was so interested in everything about my life, any and every subject to exist, and was asking so many things I've never even thought about

\- He has goals in life and actively works towards them. I have so much genuine respect and admiration for him

\- He studies philosophy/literature on the side of his engineering studies to not be too one-dimensional

\- He's very attractive

\- He has the voice of an angel

\- He actively pursued me 

  
I've always known I was anxiously attached, and it's something I've tried working on by becoming more secure in myself. I thought I was better, but clearly not, since after he asked me out I was constantly talking/thinking about him, and fully thought nothing would stop us from entering a long term relationship, and eventually get married. I controlled myself in not texting him and not letting it show, but I definitely was feeling the anxious attachment in the way I was thinking. Now, despite having only been seeing him for a week, I feel like my heart's been ripped out and I've ruined the perfect opportunity for a Godly relationship that God put right in front of me.

  
How can I get over this? I don't think I'll ever meet someone as good as him again, and I'm so sad to have messed up our connection over not being able to shut my mouth on things I would normally never say. I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for having lost him. I so badly want to beg him to give me another chance. 

  
TL;DR : Perfect Godly man came into my life. I said offensive and insensitive things. He doesn't want me. Devastated. Don't know how to forgive myself and move on

1qy2brp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy2brp,Whiskey Pour Over,"This is quite possibly the most bold and complex coffees I have ever tried. Little over a year off roast, and it’s still makes a wild cup of coffee. I used to say, if you love whiskey and you love coffee, this will be your jam! 

But as it has aged a bit, and I now have a better grinder and a scale; the tasting notes are so much more than “whiskey”. These green beans were aged in the barrel for 30 days, each day the barrel was rolled and rotated. 

These green beans dry green beans absorbing the moisture and aromatics that remained in the barrel.

This barrel was first used for red wine, then it was repurposed by Deschutes Brewery for their Black Butte Porter beer, ad then finally Repurposed a third time by Bendistillery for their Black Butte Whiskey. This barrel carried on aromatics and notes from all 3 of these processes. 

I can start to pull out notes from the wine, the whiskey, and for a medium light coffee, even a little chocolatey/smooth moth feel, while still having a crisp almost bites finish like a shot of whiskey.

1qy28we,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qy28we/so_i_had_coffee_with_that_older_disabled_woman_i/,So I had coffee with that older disabled woman I have a crush on.,"So last week I(19M) posted here looking for advice on hanging out with a woman(34F) who I always see at a park I go to, and also happens to be a wheelchair user if that's important to mention. I got many comments, and couldn't read them all. But from the comments I read, I could see people concerned about the age difference and others encouraging me to give it a shot. Unfortunately mods deleted my post for apparently breaking rule 8 which they claim I seeked for validation. But I was only looking for advice on how a relationship with an older woman and what I could do to flirt with her.

But well, here's an update regarding this. Last Sunday, I talked to her and asked her to have a meal at a store nearby, as some people in the comments suggested me. She accepted and agreed to have coffee this Friday afternoon. So well, today I had coffee with her and had a chat with her and got to know more about her. She told me she lives alone at her house which is a few streets away from mine, about her job as an accountant, and a few details about her disability. I also told her more about me. We spent the time there hanging out well, and agreed to have coffee with her tomorrow morning. 

Obviously, we just hanged out as friends, and nothing out of the extraordinary. I felt like confessing I have a crush on her, but felt nervous about it, and didn't want to rush things. I don't know how to start an actual relationship with her and how I should try it, kinda afraid about it. I know some of you here will bring up the age difference here, but I'm an adult who can consent to relationships with other adults. I'm just looking for advice about how to maybe start such relationship if possible to give it a try.

1qy28sn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy28sn,"My Top Lilikoi (Passion Fruit) Treats on Maui (Reef’s, Merriman’s, Coconut Glen’s, Ululani’s, and Momona Bakery)","We recently got back from nine days on Maui where we stayed on the South side. We love lilikoi in all its forms but especially when on vacation in Maui. Here are my top five favorite lilikoi things we ate and I think are worth a special trip: 

1. Lilikoi fresh fruit ice cream - Reef’s Fresh Fruit Ice Cream, Kihei. A New Zealand style “fresh fruit” ice cream stand in a food truck pod. Dairy free coconut base with lilikoi blended in. 

2. Lilikoi mille feuille - Merriman’s, Kapalua. Phyllo with lilikoi mousse, served with fresh island fruits and white chocolate crumbs. On a previous visit we also greatly enjoyed their lilikoi parfait. 

3. Lilikoi coconut ice cream - Coconut Glen’s, Road to Hana (MM 27.5) and Napili Farmer’s Market. They offer two flavors but the best choice is to do both scoops as lilikoi. So good. If you go, say hello to the cats. 

4. Lilikoi shave ice - Ululani’s, multiple locations (but we like the Wailuku one best). Get it with macadamia nut ice cream on the bottom and a creamy snow cap and coconut flakes on top. They let you have three flavors but we choose all lilikoi. They told us they just redid the passion fruit syrup recipe and there might be occasional seeds. 

5. Lilikoi croissant - Momona Bakery, Kahului. Get there early before they sell out around 9-10am. Huge and crispy and stuffed with lilikoi cream. You might be tempted to split one. My advice: don’t. 

Also very good and a detour: 

1. Lilikoi whiskey sour - Koast, Wailea. Sweet and tart. With Nonino Amaro. Last time we were on the island they didn’t have their liquor license yet! I hope this cocktail stays on the menu a while. 

2. Lilikoi bar - Maui Coffee Attic, Wailuku. Like a lemon bar but with lilikoi. Great place to chill and hang out with tons of seating outside. 

3. Lilikoi lemonade - Wai Lemi at the Swap Meet and the Juice Box in Hana. So refreshing on a hot day. 

4. Lilikoi shortbread - Maui Cookie Lab at the Swap Meet and Wailea Farmer’s Market on Tuesdays. We’ve had a lot of cookies on Maui over our 10+ trips. These will be tough to beat. 

5. Lilikoi bread - Aunty Lia at the Swap Meet. Like banana bread but lilikoi. Text Aunty ahead of time to pre order as she may have limited supplies. The banana bread is also very good.  

Also very very tasty if you’re nearby: 

1. Lilikoi mochi pancakes - Bacon & Blossom, Kihei. This was a weekend special, served with dragon fruit whipped cream and lilikoi butter on top. A newish truck at the South Maui Gardens.

2. Lilikoi fresh fish crudo - Koast, Wailea. Really delicious raw fresh fish preparation. I believe it was opakapaka that night. 

3. House made POG - Kihei Fish House, Kihei. A cold drink which goes great with their coconut shrimp. This is at the same pod as Reef’s.

4. Lilikoi pork pizza - Outrigger Pizza Kihei. So glad they landed at the same pod as Kihei Fish House and Reef’s; they were previously in a parking lot. Make sure to add on jalapeños. 

5. Lilikoi cream filled malasada - Sugar Beach Bake Shop, Kihei. Get there early before they sell out. They only make a certain number a day. 

6. Monkeypod Mai Tai with honey-Lilikoi foam - Monkeypod Kitchen, Kaanapali and Kihei. The classic. Unbeatable. 

We would probably take a pass on these next time as they didn’t hit for whatever reason (usually not enough lilikoi flavor): 

1. Lilikoi chiffon pie - Stillwell’s (great spot, nice staff, probably best to stick to the other items, this needed more lilikoi) 

2. Lilikoi cheesecake - Stillwell’s (ditto)

3. Lilikoi daiquiri - Ko (bright yellow but didn’t really taste of lilikoi) 

4. Lilikoi macaron - Sugar Beach Bake Shop (decent enough, like their Lilikoi Key Lime pie, could use more lilikoi)

Note: when consuming lilikoi items from Aunty Lia, Reef’s, Coconut Glen’s, and Ululani’s you may find seeds! I love finding them; for me, they’re delicious and crunchy. ",18,1770432972.0,MauiVisitors,2,0.92,False

I’m 28, based in Melbourne, and looking for a CF partner-in-crime to build that sweet, sweet DINK lifestyle with.

About me:  
I’m a funny, pro‑yap listener, avid reel sender, and all‑round good time. Physically I’m 184cm, 120kg (currently on a weight‑loss journey and in the gym 4–6 times a week), dark features — think classic Italian — with tattoos on my left arm and right leg. Happy to swap pics in messages.

I love going out for a drink or coffee, checking out new bars and restaurants, and doing fun activities for cute dates. I’m equally happy staying in, cooking a good meal, dancing around the kitchen like an idiot, and watching something great.

Travel is a big part of my life — anything from a spontaneous coastal road trip to a big international getaway. I’m also a footy fan, love music from the 50s to country to  EDM, and play guitar in my spare time. If you’ve got a playlist, I want it.

Career‑wise, I’m stable, full‑time, and studying to progress further.

About you:  
• Based in Melbourne or Victoria
• Has a job
• Childfree and wants to stay that way
• Funny, down‑to‑earth, and can hold a proper conversation
• I don't care if you smoke, vape, drink or take recreational substances 

What I’m looking for:  
Someone who wants a genuine partnership — open, honest communication, emotional maturity, and a shared vision for a DINK life. Someone who loves travelling, enjoys a mix of going out and staying in, and wants to build something steady, fun, and full of experiences.

Hi everyone!

I’ve recently moved to Melbourne (inner north) and realised I know approximately… no one outside of work 😅 so I thought I’d put myself out there.

I’m a midwife, originally from interstate, and still getting my bearings here. I love my job but the shifts make it a bit tricky to meet people the usual way. Outside of work I’m into long walks, brunch/coffee dates, op shops, Pilates/yoga, beach days when the weather behaves, and the occasional wine or pub meal. Very open to trying new things too  :) I’ve already accepted Melbourne is a personality trait, not just a city.

I’d love to meet some friendly, down-to-earth people (any gender, preferably 25–40ish but flexible) 

If you’re new to the city too, or just looking to expand your social circle, feel free to  DM. Making friends as an adult is weirdly hard, so here we are 🙃

Thanks!

1qy23kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qy23kn/the_hungor_part_iii/,The Hungor (Part I/II),"I am not one to journal my thoughts all that much, William can attest to that much at least. Though I find it very therapeutic when I get a chance to jot them down, especially in the beautiful library of our new home. It has such a dark and appealing nature that compels me to stay and read until dusk, where the speckles of sunset trickle their way inside from the tall, towering windows. I read when not engaged with the monotony of unpacking, so much clutter that ought to have been sold. I said to William before moving, verbatim I might add. “Why won’t you part with all this, you rarely use it all?” to which he replied.

“Because they hold meaning, you want to throw away our souvenirs from our many travels overseas and on the road? I will not part with any of it.” Such a dramatic flair when he speaks to me, if I loved him a little less I would find it quite irritating. But I cannot help but find his attempts at sounding profound oddly adorable in a weird way. I will say, however, that his ancestor’s choice of scenery, along with the luck of inheriting their estate, remains to be one of the best decisions we have made together. Though that list is very sparse. I do hope to add more to it in the future.

Since William is sick and tired of me gushing about how much I absolutely adore the estate, I will instead pour my thoughts here. Calling it our new home before was and remains to be an understatement, considering how opulent and imperial the house is in comparison to the sprawling countryside. A manor is a more fitting title for the sheer size of the place, though I will attempt to stay humble with my descriptions. There are beautiful, archaic designs on the walls and furniture, all of which have been perfectly preserved I may add, that evokes a mysterious and almost mystical setting that resembles the lore of Victorian nobles of old, a genre I adore reading about.

The great library is my favourite part of the house, though I do not know why it resides right next to the kitchen. My best guess is that it used to be used as a dining room by William’s parents and grandparents. How fun! I can definitely see myself having a nice cup of tea or enjoying dinner in here. There is a lovely chandelier that hangs above us, nothing too fancy mind you, but just ornate and bright enough to reveal the beautiful oak walls and bookshelves. There are candles though for a much more intimate experience, which suits some of the equally intimate books I brought with me, much to William’s dismay.

There are plenty of rooms I have yet to explore, that fact alone excites me very much so! William told me to pace myself, that there is plenty of time to become acquainted and accustomed to the halls of his family line. Though I am particularly interested in the history of the grounds outside of these walls. At least I was anyway. As we entered the property and traversed the dirt road leading to the towering manor, I saw some small, brick buildings outside that piqued my interest. I asked about it, mainly to one of his relatives, Gail, whose appearance was that of a particularly jolly and joyful older woman, happily enlightened me to some of the lore of the property.

“Oh! There used to be a town here long ago, though many of those old buildings fell during the great flood and fires. That building we passed is one of the only ones left standing.” We had a look at it together, as I admittedly left William to fend for himself in the presence of my rather stoic family. She told me of the amazing findings she had gathered from her time on the property. Mentioning how she found shards of old pottery and tools, fuelling her archaeological interests that she later pursued further at a university on the coast. The building itself stood solemnly in the shadow of the dense trees that bordered a significant quarter of the estate. The walls looked like it was made of rock, mortar and sweat, and the inside was completely hollowed out, with only the brick hearth and chimney remaining untouched by time. I noted audibly how strange the floor was, as though it was dug out much later, to which Gail replied all too cheerfully.

“That’s because there were children buried on the property, and were removed after the land was sold to the Morrison family, who then passed it down to their children, who have now passed it on down to your William.” My awe turned, and so did I as I quickly left the hollowed ground I was standing on. I wish she had mentioned something before I stepped inside, though I assumed she was desensitised to the fate of said children. She went into its history further, making sure I knew how two children in particular were mauled by dingos in the late 19^(th) century on the property. Fun. Thanks Gail. I was planning on sleeping well this week, not anymore!

I think she felt bad about scaring me, so she suggested to William that we should check out the lake in town, and though she assumed I didn’t notice, I saw her slip my William a large sum, which I later found out was to fund a fancy visit at one of the many vineyards and wineries out here. I thanked her privately over the landline afterwards. The lake itself was gorgeous and especially cool as the scorching summer heat seared me more than it did Will. The sand was especially hot, though a dip in the water helped out quite a bit, and to dry off we went for a lovely walk around the lake. There was this path that stretched around it in its entirety. On the path I saw the most hauntingly beautiful girl I had ever laid my eyes on, and I could tell that she startled William as well when we came across her. Her skin was pale, but very youthful! Her hair shimmered in silver strands under the sun, and her white dress flowed daintily in the cool, soft breeze. Our eyes met and she had the most beautiful smile I had ever seen! I wanted to say hi, though she quickly walked in the opposite direction before I had a chance to. Other than her, there weren’t too many people in or around the water that day. There was a noticeable distance between us and the locals looking back at it. We had some lovely and earthy wine afterwards, complimented with fine cheese and grapes made and harvested in the surrounding town. I don’t often feel like royalty, but I felt for the briefest moment that I had her crown upon my brow that night.

I now avoid that old building on the estate, I explored with William around the northern-most side, which sloped down into this wide and meandering river that sectioned off our estate from the neighbouring properties, who we have yet to introduce ourselves to. Though I have introduced myself to some of the many ducks and ducklings that find their way out here. I even had a large duck that had these lovely white speckles on her feathers, follow me all the way up the riverbank and partially back to the house! I’m going to call her Sandy. I love her.

Next time, I’ll bring some food for her, though when I mentioned duck feeding to Will, he said that “bread is bad and bloats them.” So, I’ll need to find something that Sandy likes to eat. Which reminds me, I’ve neglected to mention the gorgeous gardens outside, that of which stems from the old courtyard, tucked away in the corner of the manor and made of grey stone. The courtyard itself is small and quaint, though they are absolutely covered in luscious green vines and vibrantly covered flowers. The vines even reach my bedroom window! It may need a bit of a woman’s touch, if I do say so myself. But that is a job for a later date, for now I am perfectly content with unpacking the many, *many* boxes that litter the front hall and our bedroom.

Something interesting did happen today. I woke up early and made William a small breakfast, he does not eat much, so two eggs and two pieces of buttered toast is enough to satisfy him. He does drink a lot of coffee though, so I made sure to pull out his favourite mug. He asked me as I had my own breakfast. “Would you like to go for a walk around the property with me, Sophia?” I was very enthusiastic with my reply, and we agreed upon leaving after I finished cleaning the dishes and cutlery. I might have hastily and, I am slightly ashamed to admit, rather poorly cleaned them. But only because of how excited I was that William wanted to explore with me! With how busy he has been, it is no wonder how tired and hungry he was for dinner. But I’m getting ahead of myself.

Anyways, we walked around the property, though he seemed very interested in the old rubble that I have refused to approach since that day with Gail. We talked a bit about what Gail told us, he seemed to linger on the morbid, albeit brief history of that building in particular. There was a large well that sat next to it, one that William tossed a stone into, much to my disapproval. I don’t remember hearing it hit the bottom. I got a strange and unsettling feeling from that building, and I felt like it was a site of bad luck. I was only proven right when William fell and tripped on something sticking out of the red soil.

He hurt his foot pretty bad, it bled a bit, but I managed to patch him up. He is rather cute when trying to act tough despite being rather clumsy at times. After helping him and after much discouragement, I followed the trail back to where he fell. I found something strange sticking out of the ground. It did not share any similarity with any of the rocks and pebbles surrounding it, it sharpened and formed in ways that looked manmade. Before I touched it, William hobbled over and had a look at it himself. We must have shared the same thought, as he started digging as I curiously peaked around his toned forearms and dirty hands.

He pulled something out from the ground, which I can best describe as some sort of totem or figurine. It did not resemble any Aboriginal finds that I have read about, though the design seemed rather abstract. The shape of it seemed to change as William rotated it in his hands. It had a dog like shape, though it looked reminiscent of the Egyptian Sphinx that I have read about, and William said it “looks like it’s made of black quartz.” He seemed keen on holding it, and I can’t help but think he felt proud of his discovery. Though I had this eerie feeling about it, which he waived as “nerves about the stories Gail tells of the place”. Still, with the way his blood dripped off it, I wanted him to at least clean it properly before sitting it on the table in the library. He stopped me as I grabbed a rag and said he’d take care of it. Odd…

He must have worked up quite an appetite, for he asked for a much larger dinner than usual. He is a rather tall and burly man; both are aspects I am very grateful for. He usually eats the same sized meal each night. I do admit, I questioned him a bit on it, though he seemed to avoid the conversation with me, so I concluded with- “Must have had a big day with me, eh?” To which he grunted happily in response.

“Everyday is a big day with you, love.” I’m excited for tomorrow, as I have unpacked the last of the boxes in the house, and I wish to reward myself with some not-so-light reading. I found this one book in particular, that focuses on the ocean and the creatures that reside there. Despite not being too interested in the ocean myself, some of the animals and plants I have sparsely seen look very beautiful, and I wish to learn more about it. I’ll make sure that William puts that thing away after cleaning it tomorrow.

He did something strange, I was reading in the library late into the night. All was quiet in the house, and outside I could faintly hear the low calls of cockatoos that had yet to fall asleep. I had lit a few candles and was getting really into the work of Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and just as I was finishing up for the night, I looked up to see William standing in the open doorway, faintly illuminated by the dim candlelight. My heart jumped and so did I, calling out to him quietly only garnered a softspoken reply. “I couldn’t sleep” was his excuse. His eyes almost glimmered in the dark like that of an animal, despite him being my husband, I was a bit scared. Though I chalk that up to the mood that I set for myself that night. I thought nothing of it, until I headed back to my room to rest. I heard him whispering quietly to himself as I quietly approached our bedroom.

It almost sounded like he was in prayer, which surprised me as he hasn’t been a very religious man since distancing himself from the majority of his family. He still prayed from time to time and attended church on occasion, but this sounded different. I quickly tip-toed across the creaking timber floor, making as little sound as I could as I listened close. I could only make out a few words and phrases from him. It sounded like he was conversing with someone else… Sleep talking maybe?

“I do not want to … strange, wonder… you promise much… not her… should I?”

He fell quiet after a while, and I wasn’t sure if he had heard me or not. I was kneeling down by the door at this point, and my blood ran cold as I looked up to see him looking down at me from the crack of the door. His expression was hate filled, as if I just disrupted an important moment for him. I made the excuse that I dropped something and I was trying to find it in the dark. I entered the bedroom and looked around me to see if I could find who he was talking to. Unless someone walked half an hour from the road and somehow avoided making a sound as they entered the house, it was just William and I in the house. I wished him goodnight, but he did not reply. Something must be stressing him, that might explain the eating as well. He might be feeling unwell, from that cut a couple days before. I’m not a doctor by any means, but I thought I did an adequate job at patching him up. I even wrapped the bandage in a cute bow which he liked. If he is ill, I’ll look after him until he gets better.

I have had an awfully strange and stressful week. So much has happened that I need to write down, otherwise I will go mad if I bottle it up any further. I blame that thing that he still chose not to clean, even after I asked him. Multiple times I may add! He became aggressive when I had enough and cleaned it as the stains started to brown and solidify. Even writing about it is making me queasy. I hated holding the thing, that dark figurine was coarse to the touch as I washed it under the tap. I put it back where he left it afterwards, but he was still angry at me! I tempered my flame, begrudgingly, and accepted that I shouldn’t have touched it. But he has to see that the stains were attracting rot! Along with this awful, decaying smell that I was glad to be rid of.

Tragedy struck us today, I told Gail of my stress, and she decided to come down and visit us. Bless her soul, for she is a saint when compared to *some* people. It was nice having someone I could actually talk to. I don’t have many contacts outside family, which is already strenuous and full of tension at the moment. William was fine most days, but he didn’t possess the skills needed to deal with the brunt of my ire. Not while he was in this recent, unreasonable mood of his anyways. She brought her lovely little dachshund, Thomas, down with her. It might have been the smell, or some sound we couldn’t hear, because poor Thomas was whining this awful, soul piercing whine that rattled me. I asked Gail if this was normal for him, she said “Oh, he gets dramatic from time to time. I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about deary”.

I believed her, for least a bit. Though poor Thomas would continue to whine in that high, ear screeching pitch of his until William raised his voice at it. It only seemed to agitate the poor boy though. William got so mad from its whining, that I swear he was frothing at the mouth while he yelled. I wasn’t there when it happened. I’m not sure if it was his voice, the stress, some undiagnosed health condition, or a combination that caused what happened next, but the outcome remains the same. His little paws shivered and twitched before becoming stiff, his eyes bulging and focused on the library door as he passed suddenly. He wasn’t an old dog, he was only three years old, and I knew Gail was looking after him. She especially took the whole ordeal to heart, I was also emotional and we cried a bit together. “My poor boy…” she wept, over and over. What has gotten into him? He’s usually great with animals.

I helped as much as I could, I grabbed a towel we barely used to wrap him up. I went outside and gathered some flowers from the courtyard to give his passing the respect it deserved. Gail thanked me, though she seemed scornful of William. He seemed distant the whole time we were together. Gail focused her bilious glare at him. She said nothing to him as she left. I hope she’s doing okay. I’ll call her later to check up on her. Something is up with him.

There was something about his appearance that seemed off the other day. But for the life of me, I can’t exactly describe what. It’s hard to get a good look at him. He’s started wearing more layers. Maybe it’s the eyes? They seem a bit more sunken than usual. Or maybe it’s his hair? It looks rather unkempt each time I now see it. He usually has it well combed, though it seems rather greasy and thick at the moment. Also, he seems to be a bit taller than usual, as I swore I saw him duck under one of the doorways he usually has no trouble walking through. I suppose that partially explains his growing appetite.

He is becoming rather insatiable lately, and his hunger is adding a sizeable dent to the already long list of expenses. He already eats more than me, this is a fact that I have been fine with up to this point, but now his plates dwarf mine tenfold. Mountains of meat, potatoes and bread stacked high on a wide porcelain plate, and I watch from across the dining table, under the covetous glares of his ancestors trapped in the hanging family portraits, as he gorges himself on steaks, spuds and sourdough. My husband is usually a proper and polite man, at least when it comes to his table manners. So, when he started using his hands to rip and tear into the flesh from the bone it was attached to, the sight utterly shocked me. The squishy and wet sounds the meat made as it was torn away from the tendons and cartilage, along with the morsels that flicked off his butter-drenched lips as they smacked together loudly made me nauseous, to say the least. He gleefully sucked his filthy fingers in delight, while I said nothing of, course. Only shooting him a glare that he either didn’t see or actively chose to ignore.

Despite his growing hunger, he doesn’t seem to be getting any bigger. His girth is the same as it was before, and he remains just as burly as ever. In fact, he seems to be shrinking in some places. His shirts and trousers that fitted his form flawlessly once before now dangles and hangs off him like loose skin. I assumed that he was going to be larger on the scales with his recent eating habits, but for him to shrink surprised me. Shrinking around the waist I mean, for he seems to tower above me now. It’s been gradual, though I noticed that he now bends more frequently to fit through hallways. It was charming at first, though I am now worried for him. I found myself venturing outside more often, which he is more vocally against, walking along the fenceline for no real rhyme or reason other than to take in the view of the quiet countryside. It was there I made a shocking discovery...",2,1770432575.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

The first time i met you, you were a tiny girl standing against the wall with your hands holding each other. I wonder if you knew how special you were, looking like a porcelain doll! I didn't think much about you until this year.

When our eyes met again and again. How much i crave these eyes, these melancholic hazle eyes. You probably don't remember but there was this one time, you turned to put something in your bag and from all the people standing up you looked at me. There was a supernovae in my heart.

Sometimes, while you are busy at your laptop, i would stare at you across the classroom. I'm jelous of you, you are always so focused in class. My eyes notice your hand holding the mouse. How many times have i dreamed of holding your hand, your small hand.

Everyday i would meet you at the cafeteria. Have you noticed that we drink our coffee the same way? One time, while we were waiting in line, you were standing next to me. My heart was beating like the rabbit's. You bumped my hand by accident and you apologized. I replied but i didnt even turn to look at you. I didn't want you to see my blushing face. Im such a hopeless person...

This year i tried my upmost to not miss a single class, even if i was tired or sick. After the tiring weekdays comes the weekend. I hated the weekend... i would miss you. One day you were late to class. I felt disappointed, ""yet another day i wouldn't see her""... Suddenly, I turned and noticed your laptop. I couldn't help it. I smiled.

There were also the funny moments between us. Like that one time i sat next to your seat during the break talking to the professor. As the break ended you returned to your seat. I immediately stood up and went back to my seat like a fox with its tail between its legs! But you also had your fun that afternoon as we were leaving. I tried to tell you good night but you didnt reply. You walked right in front of me being indifferent listening to your music from your headphones. I actually felt happy for talking to you after so long!

The days turned into weeks, the weeks into months. But my love for you has only blossomed like a flower in the spring.

Don't worry, i don't expect anything from you. How could i do so? You don't own me anything. Only thing i want is for you to not be angry at me for feeling this way. These are my thoughts, the thoughts of a dreamer.

1qy20vb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy20vb,Foreign Ration Friday Dinner Time,"For dinner I chose a Polish W1 from our dear friends at Arpol. For all of your Polish ration needs look no further than Arpol. Since 1991 Arpol has been feeding heroes. In my humble opinion Arpol might be the best ration producer in Europe. This main is the chicken goulash and comes with raisins, rye hardtack, black currant jam, huge ass chocolate bar, instant coffee, sugar, orange isotonic and apple mango Kissel. The coolest part is the can holder that comes with it. I think they should ditch the cans and switch to retort pouches though. Save space and possibly money because you really wouldn't need the stove. 

I'm going to knock out the easy stuff first. The chocolate bar is a typical dark chocolate you get in these and it's a 7/10. Since I haven't drank the coffee yet, I'll have the rest of the chocolate with it tomorrow. The jam is always a winner for me and actually works pretty well with the rye crackers and is a 9/10. Two pots would be better than one. The rye hardtack is basically the same one you get in the Lithuanian rations. I believe Ukraine, Latvia and Russia also have these or something close. 6/10 and are best used in saucy mains like the goulash. The raisins are raisins. Not my favorite but they work in a pinch. 5/10 and maybe be a trail mix instead.

The orange isotonic tastes very vitamin-y and the maltodextrin throws off the flavor. It reminds me of Tang but not as good. It's fortified with vitamins and minerals so it serves its purpose. I give it a 5/10. Down it quick instead of sipping. This is the first time I've had Kissel and I'm still not entirely sure what to think about it. The flavor is mango despite having apple and lime in it, which isn't a bad thing. The texture is what's throwing me off. This is a starch thickened drink. It called for cold water but it didn't dissolve fully so I'd use hot next time. 6.5/10. I'm not sure what I think about it. 

The chicken goulash is really the star of the show. I usually boil the cans for 10-15 minutes and should've let it boil for a few more minutes. It was warmed through but not piping hot. It didn't affect the final product. This main was all chicken with the gravy. It sort of reminds me of the chicken and brown gravy of my youth with a different flavor profile. The chicken was juicy and tender. Chicken breast can get dry and tough even when it's cooked in gravy because of the way protein reacts with heat. The food scientist in charge needs a medal. I have yet to have even a mediocre main from a Polish ration and this was no exception. 10/10 for me all day long. 

Overall this was an excellent experience including the drinks. They're still better than the strawberry mint isotonic drink from the French rations. Have a good night. stay safe and warm and be nice to each other. If you have any pets, give them a scratch for me and tell them I said hello. Also give them an extra treat because I said so.

1qy1xnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1qy1xnv/spent_90_days_testing_5_focus_frameworks_heres/,"Spent 90 days testing 5 focus frameworks: Here's how I built a 2-hour deep work habit without losing my sanity (7 days a week, 1.5 hrs spent daily, 50% less procrastination) 🎯","Alright, let's be real for a second. How many of us have fallen for the latest ""revolutionary productivity system"" or ""game-changing habit hack"" only to find ourselves exactly where we started a month later? I’ve lost count of the times I’ve bought into the hype, downloaded the app, read the blog post, and then watched my grand plans for self-improvement slowly fizzle out. It’s frustrating, and honestly, it makes you feel like you're just not cut out for this ""personal growth"" thing.

For years, I told myself I wanted to read more. I’d buy books, stack them on my nightstand with the best intentions, and then... nothing. They'd just sit there, collecting dust, becoming a visual reminder of another failed self-improvement attempt. I tried setting big goals – ""read 30 minutes every day!"" – but that just felt like a chore I immediately resented. Motivation was a fickle friend.

After too many cycles of this, I got fed up with the all-or-nothing approach. I decided to treat my own habits like a cheap experiment, not a sacred ritual. The goal wasn't to become a reading machine overnight, but to just *start* reading consistently, no matter how small. Here's what actually started to work:

### My ""Ridiculously Small Reading Habit"" Experiment:

1.  **Debunked the ""Motivation Myth"":** I stopped waiting for inspiration. I accepted that I'd rarely *feel* like reading when I sat down, and that was okay. The trick was to make the action so small it was almost impossible to resist.
2.  **The ""One Sentence Rule"" (The Core Method):**
    *   **What I did:** Instead of ""read for X minutes,"" I committed to reading *one single sentence* from my current book every morning. Just one. Before I even took my first sip of coffee.
    *   **Time Invested:** Literally 5-10 seconds. Sometimes less.
    *   **Initial Feeling:** Honestly, it felt a bit silly. ""Is this even doing anything?"" But that was the point – to eliminate all friction and resistance.
3.  **Habit Stacking & Environment Design:**
    *   **The Trigger:** My anchor habit became ""making coffee."" After pouring the coffee, the *very next thing* was to pick up the book.
    *   **Environment Hack:** I kept the current book right on the coffee table. No hunting for it, no excuse.
4.  **Flexible Tracking, Not Obsessive Monitoring:**
    *   I used a simple ""X"" on a wall calendar for every day I read at least one sentence. No apps, no streaks to obsess over initially. Just a visual tally.
    *   **Measurable Improvement (after ~4 months):** From reading maybe 1-2 books a *year* to consistently finishing 1-2 books *a month*. My daily reading time naturally expanded from a single sentence to 15-30 minutes *most* mornings, simply because once I started, it was easier to keep going.
    *   **Impact:** A noticeable increase in focus during the day, new ideas bubbling up, and frankly, a genuine sense of calm I didn't realize I was missing.

### The Messy Middle & What Didn't Work Before:

*   **Before this:** I tried reading apps, Goodreads challenges, joining book clubs (which just added pressure). None of it stuck because the *initial barrier to entry* was too high, or the goal felt too big.
*   **The Inevitable Slips:** There were days I completely forgot. Or weekends when I traveled and broke the routine. Instead of beating myself up, I just restarted the ""one sentence"" rule the next morning. The beauty of it being so small is that failure feels minuscule, and getting back on track is effortless.
*   **The Mental Pushback:** For the first 4-6 weeks, my brain would often try to argue, ""Just skip it today, it's only one sentence anyway!"" But the commitment was to that *one sentence*, not to enjoying it or making progress. Just the act. And more often than not, the single sentence turned into a paragraph, then a page, then a chapter.

This wasn't about unlocking my ""inner reader"" or becoming a literary genius. It was about consistently showing up, even in the smallest way, and trusting that the momentum would build. No hustle, no grind, just a tiny, consistent action.

1qy1wnj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy1wnj,Multi-roaster at the US House of Reps,"A big gripe living in DC as a coffee fiend has been the lack of a top tier cafe. We have some decent cafes, but nothing that I ever really want to go out of my way for or revisit most of the time (besides maybe Doubles). I heard that a local coffee pop-up was opening a permanent location in the Cannon House Office Building last month, so I took the time to check it out on my day off.

Really great roasters on bar. They had a large pourover menu that started with more traditional options, moved into more funky/co-ferment options, and finished with higher end options like washed mejorados and geshas. The team was super knowledgeable and helpful. 

I got a Pepe Jijon Tyoxy Mejorado from SEY. They brewed it on an Orea glass dripper and it was ground on an EG-1 with ULF burrs. The brew was pretty great imo, no bitterness, tons of juiciness, lots of separation but still balanced. SEY lists a tree tomato note, which I've also noticed them putting on some of their Kenyan separations. I haven't had a tree tomato, but the coffee did kind of taste like a Kenyan which is different from the more floral ones I've had previously.

Cool thing to check out if you're in the city as a tourist! Enter from the visitor's entrance on New Jersey Ave SE. It's a shame it's only really open on weekdays during work hours.

1qy1wll,https://www.reddit.com/r/LevelUpMyHomeSG/comments/1qy1wll/transform_your_hdb_flat_with_layered_lighting_the/,"Transform Your HDB Flat with Layered Lighting: The Secret to Depth, Mood, and Functionality!","Hey r/LevelUpMyHomeSG fam! 👋 I've been lurking and posting here for years, and after finally tackling my own 4-room HDB reno last year, I **had** to share this game-changer: **layered lighting design**. If your space feels flat, dim, or one-note (like mine did pre-reno), layering ambient, task, and accent lights will make it feel bigger, cozier, and way more versatile. No major demo needed—just smart swaps that punch above their weight. Trust me, it turned my cramped living room from ""meh"" to ""magazine-worthy"" on a realistic budget.

## Why Layered Lighting is a Must for SG Homes
In our compact HDBs and condos, single overhead lights create harsh shadows and make rooms feel smaller—especially with low ceilings and limited natural light. Layering combines **three key types** for **depth, versatility, and elegance**:
- **Ambient Lighting**: Your base layer for overall glow. Think ceiling recessed lights, cove lighting, or flush mounts. It sets a warm, glare-free tone without overwhelming the space.
- **Task Lighting**: Focused beams for real-life stuff like cooking or reading. Desk lamps, under-cabinet strips, or pendants over your kitchen island keep things functional and shadow-free.
- **Accent Lighting**: The drama queens—track lights, wall sconces, or toe-kick LEDs that spotlight art, textures, or feature walls. These add dimension and highlight your reno stars.

The magic? You control the vibe: dim for Netflix nights, brighten for CNY gatherings, or mix for that Scandi hygge feel that suits our tropical humidity.

## Real SG Examples: From My Reno to Pro Tips
In my living room (standard 4-room layout), I ditched the single fluorescent bulb for:
- **Ambient**: Slim recessed panels (IKEA hacks + custom cove from a local electrician—under $500 total).
- **Task**: Floor reading lamp + pendants over the coffee table.
- **Accent**: Uplights along one wall to ""stretch"" the ceiling visually. Result? The room feels 20% bigger and transitions from work-from-home bright to dinner-party intimate with dimmers.

**Kitchen glow-up**: Under-cabinet LEDs for chopping veggies safely, plus pendants over the island for that luxe touch. No more fumbling in the dark!

**Bedroom bliss**: Dimmable ceiling ambient + bedside tasks + subtle covelights (shoutout to those patented SG designs like HAGA™) for ultimate chill.

## Pro Tips to Nail It in Your Space
Here's how to layer without breaking the bank or your back:
- **Start with ambient base**: Ensure even coverage—recessed or cove for low ceilings to avoid bulkiness.
- **Add dimmers everywhere**: Cheap add-on ($10-20 per switch) for mood magic. Go for warm 2700K-3000K LEDs with high CRI (90+) for that flattering, energy-efficient glow.
- **Vertical vs. Horizontal Layering**:
  | Technique | Best For | SG HDB Hack |
  |-----------|----------|-------------|
  | **Vertical** | High ceilings or dimension | Floor lamps + sconces + toe-kicks to ""lift"" the room. |
  | **Horizontal** | Focal points & width | Track lights on art walls or under-cabinet strips in kitchens. |
- **Budget phases**: Hit living room/bedroom first (ROI huge), then expand. Prioritize matte shades for glare control—key in our reflective tiled floors.
- **Natural light sync**: Layer around your windows/skylights; extra accents for north-facing dim spots.
- **Common pitfalls to dodge**: Overkill on accents (keep 'em subtle), ignoring functionality (test for tasks first), or cheap bulbs (invest in quality for longevity).

Pro move: Sketch your room's zones first—what's for chilling, working, eating? Tools like free apps (Planner 5D) help visualize. Local spots like IKEA, Lighting Galaxy, or custom from The Interior Lab have affordable options tailored for SG flats.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too. I love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too.

I know that our planets and stars are so closely aligned that they never touch, only off by a day, only off by a singular night sky. I get you, I genuinely feel you.

Despite my fear, despite everything telling me not to feel, you are making me think. I sometimes imagine you knocking on my door. I know you never can, but I see you, knocking on my door, gasping for air, and wanting to share a moment that we could never have. You opening up to me, sharing the depths of your emotions, fears, and even silly quirks, means the world to me. The closest we will ever be is through a coffee cup.

Didn’t try to. Sleep let things wander, and I couldn’t afford to give the past any room to stretch its legs. Instead, I sat in the office with the lights low and the fan dead, watching old footage loop until patterns started talking back.

Kassie didn’t push. She knew better.

The victims weren’t random. That much was clear now. Age, income, neighborhood, all noise. What mattered was what they carried inside them. Military-grade augmentations disguised as civilian upgrades. Early runs. Trial hardware that never should’ve made it out of a lab.

Prototypes.

I froze the frame on a spine port, zoomed in until the pixels broke apart.

“I wore something like that,” I said.

Kassie looked up slowly. “Past tense?”

“Mostly.”

The suit they put me in during the Mexican conflict wasn’t supposed to last more than six months. Field-testing, they called it. Stress tolerance. Neural load. Human factors. All the language they used when they wanted to sound like they weren’t gambling with people.

Everyone else burned out faster than I did.

Some lost themselves in the middle of firefights. Some made it home and realized the world felt wrong without the noise in their heads. A few did the math and decided not to keep going.

I just… kept functioning.

Barely.

Leon’s victims all had the same markers. Cortical stress fractures. Micro-scarring along the neural bridge. Signs of systems fighting themselves long after the war, the job, or the contract had ended.

“He’s taking the parts that push them over the edge,” Kassie said quietly.

“Yeah,” I replied. “And leaving the rest.”

I flexed my right hand. The tremor answered immediately, eager as a dog that hadn’t been walked.

“He’s not escalating,” I continued. “He’s slowing the fall.”

Kassie’s eyes softened. “That doesn’t make it right.”

“No,” I agreed. “But it makes it understandable.”

I pulled up another file. A familiar logo flickered briefly before Kassie scrubbed it out, jaw tightening.

“That’s not public,” she said.

“Neither was my medical discharge,” I replied. “Didn’t stop it from being buried.”

She didn’t argue.

Leon wasn’t just choosing targets, he was following a rule set. People the system had already written off. Bodies still running hardware nobody was maintaining anymore. People the city expected to break quietly.

Like my unit had.

Like me.

“Grant,” Kassie said, carefully, “you’re shaking.”

I looked down. Both hands now. Worse than before.

“Yeah,” I said. “It does that when I get close to the truth.”

I leaned back in my chair and stared at the ceiling, where water stains mapped out old leaks the landlord never fixed.

Leon Stormborn wasn’t trying to punish anyone.

He was trying to do what doctors do when the patient’s already bleeding out, make choices fast, knowing none of them were clean.

And if he was right…

I sat up straighter.

“He’s not going to stop,” I said.

Kassie swallowed. “Because he thinks he’s helping.”

“No,” I corrected. “Because stopping would mean admitting the system gets the last word.”

The office felt smaller then. Walls creeping in the way they used to when the suit powered up and the noise started climbing.

I reached into my coat pocket and felt the cold weight there. The gauntlet’s interface hummed faintly, like it knew I was thinking about it.

Kassie noticed.

“Don’t,” she said.

“Not yet,” I replied.

Outside, the city kept breathing wrong.

Leon Stormborn was running out of time.

And so was I.

Patterns don’t announce themselves.

They wait for you to stop lying about coincidence.

I spread the files across the desk until the wood disappeared beneath faces, specs, and half-scrubbed medical histories. Kassie watched from the couch, knees pulled in, eyes sharp but quiet. She knew better than to rush me when things started lining up like this.

“It’s not geography,” I muttered. “Not gang lines. Not money.”

I dragged three profiles into alignment. Different districts. Different lives. Same core.

“Look at the service dates,” I said.

Kassie leaned forward. “They don’t overlap.”

“Not on paper.”

I overlaid a second layer; manufacturer codes, revision numbers, stress tolerances. Old formats. Deprecated protocols. Hardware that should’ve been recalled but never was.

“Same generation,” Kassie said. “Different branding.”

“Different excuses,” I replied.

The system loved doing that. Selling the same sin with a new logo and a longer warranty it never intended to honor.

I zoomed in on a spinal interface schematic and felt the familiar pressure behind my eyes. The noise stirred, eager, like it always did when I brushed too close to things I wasn’t supposed to remember.

“He’s following the failures,” I said. “Not the crimes.”

Kassie frowned. “Meaning?”

“Meaning the city already decided these people were acceptable losses. Leon’s just getting there first.”

I pulled up another record. Military contractor. Civilian now. Listed as stable. No recent incidents. No flags.

But I knew what I was looking at now.

“Look at the maintenance gaps,” I said.

Kassie did. Her mouth tightened.

“They stopped servicing him two years ago.”

“Because statistically,” I said, “he should’ve broken by now.”

The realization settled in slow and heavy.

Leon wasn’t hunting randomly. He wasn’t reacting.

He was anticipating.

I leaned back, chair groaning in protest, and stared at the ceiling again. The stains looked like maps if you stared long enough. Old routes. Forgotten exits.

“He’s going to hit someone who hasn’t snapped yet,” Kassie said.

“Yes.”

“And when he does…”

“They’ll call it proof,” I finished. “Proof that he was the problem all along.”

Silence filled the office, thick as smoke.

Kassie broke it first. “You’re on that list, aren’t you?”

I didn’t answer right away.

My hand was steady now. That scared me more than the shaking ever had.

“I was,” I said finally. “Long time ago.”

“And now?”

I thought about the gauntlet in my pocket. About the way the city liked its loose ends tied up or erased.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But I know who is.”

I pulled up one last file. A name neither of us said out loud. A face that looked too ordinary for what it carried.

Kassie closed her eyes for a moment. “If Leon gets there first…”

“He’ll do what he thinks is right,” I said.

“And if the organization does?”

“They’ll do what they always do.”

I stood, joints aching, resolve settling in where comfort used to be.

“Then we have a clock,” Kassie said.

“Yeah,” I replied. “And it’s not Leon’s.”

Outside, the rain finally stopped. The city held its breath like it always did before things went bad.

Leon Stormborn was practicing medicine on a system that refused to heal.

And I was about to find out whether recognizing the pattern was enough to change the outcome or just proof that I was still part of it.

She chose the place.

That told me more than anything she could’ve said.

A lounge on the thirty-seventh floor of a building that didn’t advertise what it was. No signage. No windows that opened. The kind of place where drinks were expensive enough that nobody lingered unless they had a reason. The city looked unreal from up here, all glass and distance, like it couldn’t reach you even if it wanted to.

She was already seated when I arrived.

Same coat. Same posture. Same careful expression that never quite reached her eyes.

“Mr. Grant,” she said. “Thank you for coming.”

“I didn’t,” I replied, sliding into the chair across from her. “You told me where to be.”

She smiled at that. Not offended. Not surprised.

“Have you made progress?” she asked.

I didn’t answer right away. I watched her hands instead. Still. Relaxed. No tremor. No tells.

“You already know the answer,” I said.

Her gaze flicked to my right hand. Just for a second.

“You’re closer than I expected,” she said. “That’s impressive.”

“That wasn’t part of the deal,” I replied.

She folded her hands. “Neither was your judgment.”

There it was. The shift. The moment the mask stopped pretending it was skin.

“I found the pattern,” I said. “Who he’s targeting. Why.”

“Of course you did,” she said gently. “That’s why we chose you.”

I leaned forward. “You didn’t hire me to find your brother.”

“No,” she agreed. “I hired you to locate him.”

The distinction settled between us, heavy and precise.

“You knew what he took,” I said.

“Yes.”

“You knew what he was doing.”

“Yes.”

“And you let it happen.”

Her jaw tightened, just barely.

“We let it continue,” she corrected, “until it became inefficient.”

I laughed once. It came out wrong. Too sharp. Too tired.

“You used him,” I said. “Just like you used her.”

That did it.

For the first time since I’d met her, her composure cracked. Not into anger. Into irritation.

“Careful,” she said. “You don’t have the full picture.”

“I have enough,” I replied. “You want what he stole. Not him.”

She didn’t deny it.

“What Leon took,” she said, choosing her words with surgical care, “belongs to us. It was never his to keep.”

“It was a person,” I said.

Her eyes hardened. “It was an asset.”

I stood then. Slowly. Let the chair scrape just enough to be rude.

“You’re done,” I said. “Find someone else.”

She sighed, like I’d disappointed her.

“I was hoping you’d be reasonable.”

“Already tried that,” I said. “Didn’t take.”

She tapped something beneath the table. Not a threat. A confirmation.

“My employer doesn’t like uncertainty,” she said. “And you’re becoming… unpredictable.”

The air changed.

I felt it before I understood it. The pressure behind my eyes. The noise starting to rise.

“You should answer your comm,” she added softly.

I didn’t move.

“Kassie,” she said.

The name hit like a body blow.

“She stopped responding,” the woman continued, voice calm, almost apologetic. “About forty minutes ago. That’s not punishment. That’s just procedure.”

I clenched my fist until the tremor blurred into pain.

“If you’re lying…”

“I’m not,” she said. “And if you don’t tell me where Leon is, she won’t be waking up.”

The city stretched endlessly behind her, all lights and indifference.

I looked at her then. Really looked.

“You sold him out,” I said. “Your own brother.”

She met my gaze without flinching.

“I adapted,” she replied. “He didn’t.”

I reached across the table and grabbed her by the collar before the security measures had time to remember they existed. She gasped as I hauled her halfway out of her chair, the sound sharp and human and very real.

“Where is she?” I growled.

Then I blinked and next thing I knew she was on the floor; beaten, bloodied, and gargling up blood. I was standing over her, panting heavily, unsure of what just happened. I looked at my hands, covered in blood.

Then the calculation shifted.

She whispered the location. An address. A sublevel.

And slid a shard into my palm with shaking fingers.

“This will connect you,” she said hoarsely, “to the man who can end this.”

I gathered myself and left her with her dignity finally left on the floor where it belonged.

As I turned to leave, she spoke again.

“You won’t win,” she said.

I paused at the door.

“I know,” I replied. “But I’m not playing your game anymore.”

I stepped into the elevator as the doors slid shut, my reflection staring back at me; older, steadier, already past the point of retreat.

Whatever Leon Stormborn was trying to fix, the city had decided it was time to collect.

And I was done letting it decide alone.

Leon chose a place nobody would look twice at.

A flood-control substation that was no longer flooded. Concrete ribs and rusted rails humming with old power the city forgot it still used. The kind of infrastructure that outlived its purpose and learned how to stay quiet about it.

I felt his eyes watching me before I saw him.

Not fear. Not threat. Just… presence. Like a machine left running in another room.

He stood near the center of the chamber, coat hanging loose, posture careful in the way of someone compensating for pain they no longer trusted themselves to feel. The capsule sat on a crate beside him, cables coiled neatly, hands hovering near it like he was afraid to touch it too much.

The red eyes were dimmer up close. Not glowing. Strained.

“You shouldn’t be here,” he said without turning.

“I get that a lot,” I replied.

He turned slowly. Assessed me in the same way I’d felt earlier, not as an enemy, not as a problem. As data.

“You’re deteriorating,” he said. “Neural load. Right side first.”

“Yeah,” I said. “I know.”

That made him pause.

“Then you understand why I can’t stop.”

“I understand why you think you can’t,” I said, stepping closer. “That’s different.”

He looked at me then. Really looked. The red flickered, struggled, recalibrated.

“They’re coming,” he said quietly. “For her. For this.”

“I know,” I replied. “Your sister already tried to trade you for it.”

Something cracked behind his eyes. Not surprise. Confirmation.

“She always adapted faster than I did,” he said. “That was her strength.”

“And this?” I gestured to the capsule. “What is it, Leon?”

He hesitated.

Then, honesty won.

“Proof,” he said. “And hope. Not the same thing.”

“You emptied it,” I said.

His jaw tightened.

“She didn’t survive the transfer,” he admitted. “Not the way I needed her to.”

“But you kept going.”

“Because stopping wouldn’t bring her back,” he said. “It would just mean they were right.”

The hum of the station deepened, resonant and distant. I felt the noise stir again behind my eyes, eager to climb.

“They have Kassie,” I said.

That did it.

Leon flinched, not physically. Internally. Like a system spike he couldn’t dampen in time.

“They took a child,” he said, voice going flat. Dangerous. “Again.”

“She’s alive,” I added. “For now.”

Silence stretched between us, heavy and surgical.

“You want my help,” Leon said.

“I want you to disappear,” I replied. “Take what you stole and vanish.”

He shook his head. “They won’t stop.”

“I know,” I said. “That’s why I’m going to them.”

That finally drew something like fear from him.

“You’ll die,” he said.

“Probably.”

He looked down at his hands. At the faint tremor he could no longer fully control.

“I can’t help you,” he said. “I’m broken. Everything I touch breaks.”

I nodded. “Yeah. I know how that feels.”

He met my gaze again, and for a moment the red faded completely.

“I have to finish this,” he said. “Even if it costs me.”

“I figured,” I replied. “Just don’t finish it by handing yourself back to them.”

Leon exhaled slowly.

“I’ll follow,” he said. “Not to fight. Not to save you.”

“To witness,” I guessed.

“Yes,” he said. “So the truth doesn’t die quietly.”

I turned to leave, the gauntlet’s weight suddenly much heavier in my pocket.

“Leon,” I said at the door.

He looked up.

“If this goes bad,” I added, “don’t hesitate.”

He nodded once.

Outside, the city waited like it always did; patient, hungry, convinced it would win.

For the first time since this started, I wasn’t so sure.

The call came while I was driving.

No alert. No chime. Just the screen lighting up like it had been waiting for me to stop pretending I had time.

Kassie.

I pulled over under an overpass that still carried traffic it wasn’t rated for anymore. Concrete dust drifted down in slow sheets, catching neon from somewhere above like falling embers.

I answered.

“Hey,” she said.

Her voice was steady. Too steady.

“You hurt?” I asked.

“No,” she replied. “Not yet.”

I closed my eyes.

“They think I’m asleep,” she continued. “Or sedated. These gagoons weren’t careful.”

“Where are you?” I asked.

“Sublevel storage,” she said. “Old logistics hub. No windows. Lots of clean floors.”

That tracked.

“They brought drones,” she added. “Not people. Or at least not anymore.”

My grip tightened on the wheel.

“How many?”

“I stopped counting at four,” she said. “They don’t move like soldiers. More like… bots.”

I swallowed.

“Kassie,” I said, “listen to me very carefully.”

“I know,” she interrupted gently. “You’re going to say you’ll get me out. You’re going to lie a little so I don’t hear what you’re thinking.”

I didn’t answer.

She sighed. “You still have the gauntlet.”

“Yes.”

“You can’t use the suit,” she said. “You know what it does to you. We ran the sims. Best case, you don’t come back the same. Worst case…”

“I know,” I said.

There was a pause on the line. Then something softer.

“I’m not scared,” Kassie said. “I just need to know what you’re going to do.”

I reached into my coat and felt the second component there. Cold. Heavy. Waiting.

“I can’t use the gauntlet alone,” I said. “But I don’t need the whole suit.”

Another pause. Longer this time.

“You’re carrying it,” she said. Not a question.

“Yeah.”

“That piece burns the limiter,” she said. “It doesn’t protect you. It just… delays the collapse.”

“I know.”

She exhaled slowly. “Then this is where I say something selfish.”

“Okay.”

“Don’t do it…. For me,” she said. “Let them take me.”

I smiled despite myself. It hurt.

“They’ve set a meet,” I said. “They want Leon. And what he took.”

“Of course they do.”

“I told them yes.”

That got her attention.

“And?”

“And I’m not bringing either.”

Silence. Then a quiet, almost-laugh.

Then I heard footsteps in the background. Distant. Measured.

“They’re moving,” she said. “I don’t have much longer.”

“I know.”

“Grant,” she said. “Please don’t do anything stupid.”

“I won’t,” I replied.

She was quiet for a moment.

“Okay,” she said.

The line cut.

I sat there under the overpass, engine idling, city rumbling overhead like it didn’t care how this ended.

I pulled the second piece from my coat and set it on the seat beside me. Old. Scarred. A prototype that never made it to market because it killed too many test subjects too fast.

Figures.

I didn’t put it on yet.

First, I turned the car back toward my office.

There was one more thing I needed.

And then I was going to go meet the kind of people who thought everything could be reduced to terms and conditions.

They were about to find out what happens when someone finally stops agreeing.

The meeting place was exactly where he said it would be.

A skeletal high-rise mid-collapse, wrapped in scaffolding like a body waiting to be examined. The upper floors were gone, sheared off years ago and never rebuilt. Wind moved through the open concrete ribs, carrying the smell of rust, rain, and old electricity.

I parked two blocks out and walked the rest of the way.

The gauntlet sat heavy on my right arm. Powered down. Quiet. The second component pressed against my ribs from inside my coat like it knew what it was for.

They were already there.

Three drones stood in a loose arc near the edge of the exposed floor. Human silhouettes, wrong in the way mannequins were wrong. Too still. Too patient. Their chrome was matte, utilitarian; no branding, no flair. Just function.

The man waiting with them looked almost disappointing.

Mid-fifties. Expensive coat. No visible augmentations. A gun in his hand that didn’t pretend to be anything other than what it was.

“You’re late,” he said.

“I came alone,” I replied. “Be grateful.”

His eyes flicked to my arm. Calculated. Interested.

“Where’s Leon Stormborn?” he asked.

“Not here.”

“And the asset?”

I didn’t answer.

He smiled thinly. “This doesn’t need to be personal.”

“It always is,” I said. “You just bill it differently.”

He nodded once, as if indulging me.

One of the drones stepped forward. Slow. Deliberate.

“Bring him,” the man said. “Or we proceed.”

The gauntlet hummed. Low. Hungry.

I reached into my coat and pulled out the second piece.

The man’s smile faded.

I locked it in place.

Pain hit first. White and immediate, like my nervous system had been yanked forward half a second ahead of my body. The limiter burned out with a sound I felt more than heard. The world sharpened violently.

The drones moved.

I met the first one head-on.

Not fast. Not clean. Just enough force to tear it off balance and send it skidding into a support column. The second grabbed my arm, metal fingers digging into failing muscle and for a moment I felt the noise surge, overwhelming and bright.

I screamed.

Or maybe I didn’t. Hard to tell.

The third drone went down under the gauntlet’s discharge, systems frying in a shower of sparks that tasted like copper and ozone. I staggered back, vision tunneling, heart trying to punch its way out of my chest.

The man raised his gun.

Then stopped.

“Leon!” he called out, almost amused.

Leon stepped from the shadows near the stairwell.

No rush. No drama.

The capsule hung from his shoulder, cradled carefully, like it still mattered.

“Let her go,” Leon said, voice steady despite the red flaring hard behind his eyes. “I’ll give you what you want.”

The man gestured lazily.

Kassie was pushed forward into the light. On her feet. Pale. Awake.

“Asset exchange,” the man said. “Clean and simple.”

Leon set the capsule down between them and took a step closer.

“You don’t get to keep doing this,” Leon said. “Not to people.”

The man laughed. “You already proved we do.”

He reached for the capsule.

Leon moved.

The knife was ugly. Rusted. Practical.

He drove it forward, once.

The man gasped, stumbling back, gun clattering across the concrete. They struggled; desperate, clumsy, until the capsule tipped, hit the ground, and cracked open.

It was empty.

The man froze.

“What did you do?” he whispered.

Leon didn’t answer.

The gun came up.

One shot.

Leon dropped where he stood, eyes finally dark.

I didn’t think.

I grabbed the knife and threw it.

It struck the man cleanly, just above the eye. He fell without a sound, surprise still on his face.

The world went quiet.

The gauntlet died.

So did my legs.

I hit the ground hard, breath leaving me in a rush I couldn’t get back. The noise in my head surged once more, bright and final, then began to fade.

Kassie was there suddenly, hands on my shoulders, tears cutting clean lines through the grime on her face.

“Don’t,” I said, though I wasn’t sure what I meant.

She shook her head. “You don’t get to tell me that.”

I tried to smile. It didn’t work.

“They’re going to tell it wrong,” I managed.

“I won’t let them,” she said fiercely.

Good answer.

The city breathed in around us, already deciding how this would be forgotten.

As my vision dimmed, I thought of Leon Stormborn, a doctor who tried to fix what the world refused to treat.

And of Kassie.

Still here.

That would have to be enough.

Epilogue

The office smelled the same.

Dust. Old circuitry. Coffee that never quite left the walls. Kassie stood in the doorway longer than she meant to, keys still in her hand, like the room might object if she crossed the threshold too quickly.

Grant’s funeral had been simple. No uniforms. No flags. Just people who knew him standing close enough to share the silence. She’d left before anyone could ask her how she was doing.

This was harder.

She stepped inside and let the door close behind her. The neon across the street still bled through the blinds in tired stripes. Pink. Blue. White. The fan was gone. Someone, maybe her, had finally got rid of it.

She crossed to the desk.

A small amber light pulsed near the edge of Grant’s terminal.

Message indicator.

Her breath caught. Just once.

She activated the display.

2 UNREAD MESSAGES

The first wasn’t his.

Leon Stormborn’s name flickered into view, timestamped a few hours before the meeting.

Kassie swallowed and played it.

Leon’s face appeared briefly; drawn, red eyes dimmed almost to nothing.

“I swapped it,” he said quietly. “The capsule. They’ll never notice. They never do.”

He looked off-screen, listening to something only he could hear.

“The real one is safe. Coordinates attached.”

A pause.

“I’m sorry I couldn’t fix it,” he added. “But maybe you can.”

The message ended.

Kassie sat very still.

Then she opened the second file.

Grant didn’t appear on-screen. Just his voice. Tired. Familiar.

“Hey, kid,” he said.

Her hands shook.

“If you’re hearing this, then I didn’t stick the landing. Figures.”

A breath. A small, almost-smile she could hear.

“I never said the things I should’ve. Not because I didn’t feel them. Because I didn’t want to put weight on you that you didn’t ask for.”

Another pause.

“You saved me more times than I can count. Gave me something to protect that wasn’t a mistake. That mattered more than you know.”

Her vision blurred.

“Everything I have is yours. The business. The accounts. The mess. Even the suit, if you decide the you need it. Or burn it. That’s your call.”

His voice softened.

“You don’t owe anyone anything. Least of all me. Just… don’t let them tell it wrong.”

Silence.

The message ended.

A final option blinked on the screen.

ACCESS CONFIRM

Kassie hesitated.

Then pressed it.

There was a low mechanical click behind her.

She turned as the bookshelf against the far wall slid aside, smooth and deliberate, revealing a recessed alcove lit from within.

The suit stood there; scarred, incomplete, quiet.

Waiting.

Kassie wiped her eyes with the heel of her hand and looked back at the desk. At the chair he’d never sit in again.

“Okay,” she whispered.

Outside, the city kept breathing.

Inside, for the first time, Kassie didn’t feel like she was running from it.

She shut off the light and stepped forward.

She could almost hear him:

“In Night City, you either bend… or you let it break you.”",2,1770431440.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1qy1orx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qy1orx,Diary of a Chainsmoker at NYU,"There was a spot I liked to sit outside the main building at NYU where I had my classes. I think it was possibly called the College of Arts and Science Building. It was directly across from the pizza place. There was a set of maybe three concrete steps going up the side of that building, which led nowhere. Just random steps. Or perhaps when first constructed, there’d been an entrance there. 

There I sat, quite often, during the five years I was at NYU. In fact, I was such a regular presence on those steps, every pair of jeans I had, on the backside were a bit worn, where my butt, the skin, muscle, and a little fat, was thinly stretched over my pelvic bones, such that I was never comfortable for long sitting on the cold concrete. What I mean to say is, my jeans, every single pair, had a hole surrounded by thinned, worn denim, one hole on each buttock, where my pelvic bones rested on the concrete steps. My $800 per month allowance, which was to cover rent, utilities, and all living expenses in New York City, didn’t cover the cost of clothing. 

I looked around for a job and found one with NYPIRG. I hated it. I’m not a salesperson, or wasn’t. The 10-minute training made it sound like I was fleecing people without their knowledge. I was uncomfortable with that. It was outside of my accepted ethical standards of behavior towards others. Plus, I was terrible at it. Not a natural at all. I was too dry and clinical to make people believe they needed to do something, like sign my petition ***AND*** give me a monetary donation. I felt like I was told to lie. This was my job. I couldn’t do it.

When I did lie, it was usually by omission. But I almost always turned myself in. I couldn’t have been a normal teen. I finally relaxed when I didn’t have my brother spying on me, looking for opportunities to go stir up someone’s emotions or temper towards me. He inherited our nasty grandmother’s oleander genes.  He was always hoping to see me hurt. To make others hurt me, especially unjustly. That can’t be normal big brother behavior either. I hid my life until he was out of the house. 

I had one human moment with him. He’d written a poem, and wanted to show it to me. It was good. He had his own style. It was an imaginary scene description, but artfully done. I’m glad I have one or two moments during all of our childhood and teens where he acted without malice aforethought. Wasn’t trying to cut off my toes with a garden hoe as I stood mesmerized by him working the soil when we were small. When he showed me the crawdads under the bridge near Armand Bayou Elementary where we both attended. Just a few. But I’ll take it. 

Nope. As I said. Most of my lies, were temporary lies of omission. I failed to tell my father, who set a 2am curfew, that I didn’t roll in until well after sunup. Not until we were all in the car together, him, me, stepmother #?. And from the heavily aromatic leather backseat of the Benz he drove, I’d listen to them chat about this, that, or the other thing. 

I distinctly recall once, I was slouched down into the leather seat, thinking and quietly listening, on the way to wherever we were headed. And he’d start a little light conversation with me. Ask me what I was doing back there, what was going on, as he eyed me playfully in the rearview mirror. And I’d fess up immediately that I’d been drunk off my ass all night and barely crawled in by 7:30am. He’d dart a few glances back at me, look a little stunned and even uncomfortable, then rekindle a different topic of conversation with the current stepmother. 

No one ever checked that I made it home. He rarely bothered me early in the morning. I could probably count the occasions in which he did, on one hand. He knew I was moody, grumpy, didn’t want to be bothered—no, I don’t want anything to eat, I’m not hungry, I’m fine, leave me alone, go away—and he wouldn’t be able to get me to smile no matter how he prodded me. He had his lovable moments. He wasn’t always a total bastard. And he was the better of my two parents, if you can imagine that. 

But when I told my father I wanted to help support myself, to be able to live a little better, without all the ramen noodles, that I believed I could do it by modeling part time, he reacted badly. It was unexpected. I thought he’d be happy, maybe even proud that I took the initiative and found something temporary until I could find something sustainable. No. He told me if I wanted to work, he’d stop paying for my education at NYU and withdraw all support. It was my job to be a student. No other job should compete with that. 

Okay. Well. I guess I’ll resign from NYPIRG.

I refused, at some point, to willingly return home to my father, and subject myself to that nasty bit of trash he’d just married. I know that sounds snobby, but if you knew her, and ***EVERYTHING*** she’d done, I think you’d agree she was subpar on the spectrum of acceptable/unacceptable humans.  In fact, I’m not certain she was human at all. In evolutionary terms, she seemed to more closely resemble an amoeba, than even a mammal, such as a sewer rat. 

For example, I wasn’t allowed to have my best friend during freshman year in high school visit me at my house when we got to senior year because……she was black. Yeah. That kind of trashy. The day Judy informed me Shannon wasn’t allowed at the house because she happened to be born with more melanin in her skin than, say, some snowflake like myself, I was stunned, but regained my composure almost immediately. I then pointed out to the big-assed, dumpy-looking trash how surprised I was at her sentiments. After all, she looked so Native American herself—Brobdingnagian nose, dark skin, horsey looking face, jet black hair, severe expression, dark, deep-set eyes. 

Tee hee….

She spat back, “I ain’t no *injun*!! I’m *white*! And I’m ***only*** *white*!!” 

Okay. Definitely indigenous though I don’t think they’d want you either. Showing our cultural roots and true colors, are we? My Dear Reader, please do not take offense to my words towards her. She was every bit of stereotypical trailer park kind of nasty. 

While I’m partial to the Israeli look, I also find Native American, Hispanic, middle eastern, and all other men with dark hair, *exceedingly* attractive. Even the big-assed dumpster would’ve been a bit more appealing had her beady little eyes not looked as though she was part possum and a tool of the devil himself. 

There I sat, in the autumn chill, my ass cheeks in contact with the cold concrete, on the steps at NYU across from the pizza place, that went nowhere. They were my favorite hangout in between classes, if there wasn’t enough time to walk home, and back, or I lived too far away. Some of those pauses in my day could be quite long. But why return to Brooklyn or Jersey City? It’s too far and money wasted on train fare. 

So I’d sit there, my textbooks, calculator, pencils, pens, spiral notebooks, folders, and papers, spread widely around me on the steps and landing at the top, greedily taking a lot of space. I’d light cigarette after cigarette, in one hand, too engrossed to really smoke, allowing each one to slowly smolder down to the filter, my third warm coffee beside me. It was often cold out, which meant my whole body was tensed, perhaps shivering, which made the fact my bladder was usually full, even more unpleasant. 

I eventually had to pick it all up, close my books, my notebooks, stash my loose papers and handouts in the folders, put the pens, pencils, and calculator at the bottom of my heavy, black leather backpack, carefully stow the larger items on top, cinch the opening snugly shut, so no one standing or walking behind me could opportunistically reach in. Then I’d take one last drag, or maybe two, whatever was left of the cigarette, put it out, slip the pack and lighter into my jacket pocket, maneuver, rather than sling, the now heavy backpack over my shoulder—I weighed a ***max*** of 120 pounds at the time, and I’m 5’ 10”—and finally pick up my coffee, before vacating the small, tentatively warm spot I’d made on the concrete, to go inside in search of an uncrowded ladies room, from which the toilet paper had not yet been stolen. 

If it was really cold, I’d take the elevator up to whatever floor I needed, sit on the old, dark, asbestos tiles from another era, in a dimly lit hallway, just outside the classroom where I next had to present myself, and do the same thing, books and papers on my lap, as well as spread out on either side.

But let me pause a moment. Those elevators, my God…

I’m certain, the allowable load for whichever elevator I was on, had been exceeded, and not by a little bit, each and every time it took into its mouth, an enormous gaggle of students, crushed against one another as tightly as possible, since many were already late to class. 

We were an unsightly mass of arms, some sticking out over our heads. There was no room to expand your chest walls, your lungs, so one could not breathe, not adequately enough to receive the necessary oxygen, even for the short duration we were intimate in a way, yet fully ignoring each other’s presence. Add to that the backpacks, long hair, body smells, heat, and soft grunts as the elevator swayed and moved up a floor. 

In that day, there were no elevator buttons, no calls from the back, over the mass of bodies, to request a certain floor button be pushed. None of that. Instead, there was a person, usually possessing a conspicuously slight and petite build, and who sat on a small, wooden stool, tucked into the corner at the front, typically on the left. 

The elevator operator. 

Decked out with a uniform and cap that always seemed awkward, almost draped loosely as it was much too large for the wearer, the operator closed the elevator doors, verbally encouraging everyone to move their arms and legs out of the way, which naturally resulted in a tighter crush, and called out the doors were now closing, before rotating a metal handle, which stuck out on a disc in the front elevator wall to the left of the doors, to start the elevator moving to the next floor. 

There was almost a sigh, a collective gasp for air, when the operator stopped the elevator at the second floor, for students to wriggle around and issue forth into the hallway. Many of those in front had to step out to loosen the gnarled tangle of limbs, bodies, and backpacks, just enough for the one person at the back to finally wriggle out, as though he or she had just been birthed again.

I wonder now, if they’ve updated those ungodly contraptions. One couldn’t help but imagine how the metal box as it went up or down, held by recklessly old and overburdened cables, could suddenly plummet to the bottom after an audible and foreboding snap. Everyone…..well at least I myself….during every ride, strained to hear the first groanings from the cables above, which would portend an inevitable mechanical failure. 

Even in the late 1980s and early 1990s, that type of elevator was one I’d never seen before. I reckon they were originally installed when the building was first constructed, probably in the 1890s or 1900s. Wait….I’ve got to Google it. It’s irresistible. One moment…..

Yes!!! 1892!!! 

Fortunately, it never happened. Not while I was there anyway. And unless the classroom I needed was on the second or third floor, I was loathe to use the stairs. But there I sat, sometimes for a few hours, especially in my early years at NYU, as it seemed the general required classes were all located in the one enormous building. 

So there I sat, on the old, dark red asbestos tiles in the dimly lit halls, if the weather was poor or too cold. I’d spread out my accoutrements, some onto my lap, spilling over on either side, and smoke heavily….chain smoke really, though I’d absentmindedly let them smolder down to the butt. At least until I had no coffee left. Then I’d stop. 

Smoking was allowed in the buildings back then. Or if it wasn’t, no one cared. Rules aren’t necessarily considered rules in the strictest sense, not in New York City. They are more likely to be interpreted as suggestions.

Looking back, I didn’t realize, not until just moments ago, how the pizza place, the shop next door where I bought my coffee (large regular coffee please) and toasted bagel with cream cheese, and those steps on the side of the Arts and Science Building, would represent my aggregate experiences at NYU. 

It’s a huge university. Not only does it sprawl through The Village and other parts of NYC, but there are numberless students. There was something like 20,000 students in my graduating class, alone. I think you had to buy tickets to reserve a spot in the stands the university set up around Washington Square Park. I don’t recall much of the ceremony, mainly that Martin Scorcese was the student speaker. He graduated the same year, though probably from Tisch School of the Arts. I also think he was in a graduate program.

I don’t recall now if my mother and I visited the steps, for one more nostalgic sit, when we returned in 2011. We did visit Mandarin Plaza, the outside only, before we turned toward where the twin towers used to soar above Manhattan, the very fingerprint of New York City, and where we celebrated my graduation at Windows on the World, located at the top of the North Tower. My God, had I known then, just how precious those moments would be, I’d perhaps remember more than Robert and my father swapping stories about me. 

I can’t recall what I ate.

I got tired of two things:

1. **Parsing cryptic METAR strings** while trying to work.
2. **Doing the mental math for ""Legal Night""** (Sunset vs. Civil Twilight) to know when I actually need to be back on the ground.

So, while stuck in a hotel room in Berlin recently waiting for a ceiling to lift, I built **FlyCheck**. I just pushed **v1.1** which focuses on the solar logic I needed most.

**The High-Utility Features:**

* **The Twilight Line:** It calculates your exact Sunset and Civil Twilight (-6°) based on the reporting station and gives you a live countdown in the menu bar.
* **Signage UI:** I ditched the standard system fonts for **Helvetica Neue Condensed Bold**. It looks like the physical signs on the ramp—easy to scan from the corner of your eye while you're on a Zoom call.
* **Color-Coded Situational Awareness:** The menu bar icon changes based on flight rules (🟢🔵🔴🟣).
* **Standardized Zulu Toggle:** One tap to switch between local and UTC timestamps.
* **No Subscriptions:** It’s a one-time $9 ""buy the dev a coffee"" thing.

I built this specifically for the ""Desktop Pilot"" — the phase where you're monitoring the weather from your Mac before you even head to the hangar.

Even light teasing about her wanting to travel with me. Then I asked if she wanted to go for coffee and she ghosted for almost a complete 24hrs !

Mind you, she usually responds either within 60 seconds or within an hour. She basically said she cant this week but would let me know if anything changes tho. I said thanks for letting me know and left her alone.

  
She continued to come side beside me with a classroom full of people (roughly 100 students) and I just acted indifferent - not mad, not excited just complete indifference ! She acted indifferent also and I just literally stopped caring (im proud of myself to be honest, this is the first time I literally couldn't care less about a girls life after she rejected me and I dont mean this bitterly). More like, if she was in trouble and needed help I wouldn't feel bad completely ignoring her (before id feel guilty)

  
She now only texts me for school related stuff and I always respond but never give her the answer.

My husband isn’t a deadbeat by any means, but i feel like he’s so lazy and is just a miserable parent and partner at this point.

A little bit of context, I’m 6 weeks postpartum with our first child. My husband just went back work (regular 9-5) and so I am with our son all day and all night. I have noticed more recently the lack of interaction between my husband and our son (before and after he went back to work).

Before he went back to work he never offered to take the baby off my hands (unless i told him i needed to tap out), would always shower and eat breakfast, make himself some coffee before ever asking me what i needed in the mornings (even though he slept in every morning and i didn’t), would look/act so miserable when he had to take care of the baby because i needed to tap out (mainly when baby was crying), amongst other small things.

Now that he’s back at work, feels like it’s all the same issues but now he’s “tired” and getting used to waking up early again. As if i want to hear that because he gets to sleep through the night. I just want my husband to WANT to bond with our child. He says he loves this child and i believe him but thinks im the only one who can calm our child when he’s upset. 

Granted, when im preoccupied with our son and he’s home, he takes every request i have (fill my water, grab my phone, bring me food, etc) I just pictured a different life with him after having a newborn. Never thought id be so upset and resent this man. 

I’m honestly just disappointed in him and thought things would be better. Like he would have some excitement being dad, hearing his baby cry and want to fix it, see mom tired and offer to take him, get home and want to catch up and interact with his baby.

1qy1hjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tiguan/comments/1qy1hjm/cluster_clock_and_radio_not_synced_fix_activate/,Cluster Clock and Radio not synced {FIX} + Activate Voice and Carplay/Android Auto,"Hello,

There is a massive issue with volkswagen cars from 2015 to 2020 where the radio doesn't show the correct time anymore and only shows either 00:00 or 06:28. The issue is that the instrument cluster panel time can be set, and on the board there is a chip that communicates with the radio and gives the time to it so it's synced. There is an issue where after a few years a hexidecimal value in the chip goes too high and the chip fails. This could only be fixed by buying an EEPROM CH341A device, dissassembling the cluster and attaching a clamp to said chip and rewriting the hex value on a laptop. A large community of people even started a petition to try and convince Volkswagen to bring out an update to fix it. Some even wanted to start a class action lawsuit. I was scrolling trough reddit to find a fix and luckily i found a person that linked a german forum. It looked complicated at first, but it took me 25 minutes in total. Below are the instructions and the links for the non german speaking lads.

This worked for me, i followed the steps and the video using the correct files. Don't forget your still kinda tampering with obsolete hardware and software and if you use the wrong files or methods you could brick your radio. It is very easy to install, and i made the steps extra clear. **You don't need to mess with the OBD port or any chips. All you need is an SD card and a laptop/pc that can read it.**

My car: Volkswagen Caddy 2016

I bought an SD card for a samsung camera, and windows only let me format it to either exFAT or NTFS. Appearently these are just windows restrictions and you can still format those to FAT32. Heres a video on how to do that.

December 25 2025

Hello everyone, VAG has finally taken pity on us and released an update for MIB2 PQ units with the 02xxT software train. In connection with this update and some new findings, we've created a new thread to address the clock issue. Initially, until all the links are collected and available, the thread will be updated several times. So, it's worth checking back regularly. There will be an informational post whenever a new link is added.

The problem in question:  
VW, Seat, and Skoda vehicles on the PQ platform that use an MIB2 PQ infotainment system can experience a clock display error. They will only show 00:00 or 06:28 alternately. Additionally, the arrival time from the navigation system (if equipped) is no longer calculated and displayed correctly. To fix this problem, a simple firmware update for the infotainment system, which can be installed via SD card, is sufficient It no longer matters whether you have a navigation system (2 SD card slots) or not (1 SD card slot).

The solution: A firmware update for the infotainment system via SD card.  
The required firmware update varies depending on which firmware version is currently installed.  
To find out, proceed as follows:  
Press and hold the MENU button, then select “Software Update/Versions”.  
Here you will find the installed software version.  
For a 02xxT software version, an update to 0255T is required.  
For a 03xxT software version, an update to 0369T is required (except for Skoda).  
For a 04xxT software version, an update to Seat 0478T / VW 0480T is required (except for Skoda).  
Example: If ""MST2\_EU\_VW\_PQ\_P0241T"" is installed in the vehicle, this means you should use the VW 02xxT link, i.e., ""MST2\_EU\_VW\_PQ\_P0255T"".

Here is a collection of links for the respective updates. Please make sure you select the update for your specific vehicle (VW, Seat, Skoda).

Firmware update installation:  
Required:

* Computer/Laptop and SD Card Reader
* A good quality, full-size SD card. At least 4GB, 8-32GB recommended. A proven SD card is the silver SanDisk Ultra 32GB. ***Please DO NOT use a microSD card with an adapter!!! This could brick your radio!***

* Before starting the update, test whether your touch screen in the upper right corner is working. Otherwise, you may encounter problems confirming and ending the update, as you'll need to tap a back arrow. Tips for when your touch screen isn't working are listed below:

Option 1 (Recommended): Replace the digitizer.  
A new digitizer usually costs less than €20 and can be easily replaced, even by inexperienced users, within 1-2 hours (allow time for coffee/tea/beer). Experienced DIYers and hobbyists should be able to do it much faster.  
You can find a new digitizer on platforms like Amazon, eBay, and AliExpress. Simply search for ""TDO-WVGA0633F00039"".  
The digitizers usually come with adhesive strips already attached, so you can simply stick them onto the old, defective digitizer.  
To replace the digitizer, the radio needs to be removed and unscrewed. Don't be intimidated; the process is quite simple. There are even YouTube videos that demonstrate the whole process. Examples can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6FNc1gQ0YI) , [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbZdAisl2rk) , and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnDARnryij8) .

Option 2: If you absolutely don't have the patience to ""replace"" your digitizer, or if the update has already happened and you're only now discovering that the touch screen isn't working, you can try pressing and holding your finger firmly in the upper right corner of the screen, where the back arrow is. At the same time, tap and/or swipe firmly on the opposite side of the screen (bottom left). Sometimes this can trigger a touch response in the desired area. If that doesn't work, try ""rolling"" your finger slightly in the upper right corner while applying moderate pressure and tapping somewhere else on the screen.

Option 3: If you have diagnostic hardware available (VCDS, OBDEleven, an ELM327 scanner, and the smartphone app ""Car Scanner""), you can use an [XOR calculator](https://mib-helper.com/im-so-xory/) to confirm the ""installation change"" in the radio's adaptations (control unit 5F). CarScanner has an option for this and can do it automatically. VCDS, OBDEleven, etc., require the XOR calculator. To do this, note down the currently written code, enter it into the XOR calculator, note the new code, and write it into your adaptations.

**IMPORTANT regarding step 4** : This is what the main directory of the SD card should look like if the update has been correctly copied to the SD card. Individual folders may differ, but it should look approximately like this.

[](https://preview.redd.it/cluster-clock-and-radio-not-synced-fix-activate-voice-and-v0-ezqdln57fzhg1.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=5840f325564b9555b51128c65d02d6746af3991f)

https://preview.redd.it/e6gxu8gvfzhg1.png?width=366&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6e816b3b6a00de7bae9894f200646f63215a9c

Tutorial:

1. Download the appropriate update.
2. Extract the update
3. Format the SD card to FAT32 on your computer.
4. Copy the extracted update to the root directory of the SD card. It is important that the update, including all its folders and the “metainfo2” file, is located in the root directory of the SD card.
5. Insert SD card into the car
6. Press and hold the MENU button, then select “Software Update/Versions”. Tap “Update” at the top, select the SD card, then select the update and tap Start, then Next.
7. The radio will restart several times. Once the update is complete, a list with many entries and ""OK"" next to each will appear on the screen. On this screen, tap the back arrow in the upper right corner, then tap Cancel. The radio will restart again; after that, the update is complete and the SD card can be removed.

You have successfully completed the update. The time issue should now be resolved.

**BONUS:**

VW discontinued their key services for the older devices under 2020 (atleast in my country). Currently there is no way to get Voice or Carplay/Android Auto working on these models officially. There is however an easy work around that takes literally 2 minutes to do, and unlocks both those features on your radio. It's literally the exact same update steps as above. Only do it after you updated to that specific version. Steps below.

1. (Optional): Clear the SD card again, copy the contents of the ""VW\_PQ\_P0255T\_FEC\_ALL\_CID\_OFF\_FIXED"" folder to the root directory of the SD card, start the update in the vehicle, and complete it. -> This step unlocks features such as App-Connect and voice control. It also allows the use of any SD card for navigation maps.

I got a little jealous and asked if he goes on break with her often. I get insecure and I joked about how I know it’s silly to be insecure and I understand it’s a work relationship but that I would appreciate if they only went on breaks when someone else was around. Not alone anymore. He agreed. Well fast forward to February and I had his phone in my hand and was going to send myself by something in a message when I saw her name. I found a long thread of their messages where he is the one initiating breaks the day after I set the boundary. They drove to get coffee a week later. He bought her a birthday present and didn’t tell me. Then I started looking at their older messages before December and I see she talks about her relationship problems, he sends her songs (a song that means a lot to me) and he checks in on her. I’m hurt and feel betrayed. Although it may have been innocent his lying makes me think otherwise. He said he thought I was joking and that he thinks we would get along but I don’t believe him.

1qy1eue,https://i.redd.it/0jerlwtcfzhg1.png,Stop Sleeping More. It’s Not The Solution To Your Tiredness.,"It’s the same cycle every day. You wake up after 8 hours of sleep, down two coffees, try to be productive, and by 2 PM you’re completely drained again.

​Everyone tells you the same thing: ""You just need more sleep"" or ""Stop being lazy.""
​Here’s the truth: If you are getting adequate rest but still feel exhausted, sleep is not the problem. And you aren't lazy.

​You are likely suffering from ""Psychological Fatigue.""

​Think of your brain like your phone. Even if it's plugged into the charger all night (sleeping), if you have 50 background apps running full blast—worrying, doom-scrolling, overthinking, high dopamine consumption—the battery is still going to drain faster than it can charge.

​You don't need another nap. You need to start closing some mental tabs.

1qy1dj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qy1dj4/sf_terms_and_condition_a_cyberpunk_noir_short/,[SF] Terms and Condition: A Cyberpunk Noir Short Story pt. 1/2,"The City looks loud from a distance. Neon stacked on concrete. Towers clawing at the sky like they’re trying to leave. Up close, it’s quieter. Not peaceful, just resigned.

The streets hum instead of scream. Power lines buzz. Old buildings settle into themselves. People move like they’ve learned the timing of the machinery that doesn’t care if they’re in the way. Everyone’s got someplace to be, even if they don’t know why anymore.

This city isn’t cruel for sport. It’s practical. It takes what works and grinds down what doesn’t. Calls it efficiency. Calls it progress. Leaves the rest to rot in alleys that smell like rain and ozone and something sweet you don’t want to identify.

Night City doesn’t hate you. That would take effort. It just watches to see how much pressure you can take before you fold. Some people bend early and learn how to live crooked. Some hold straight until the stress fractures show and everything snaps at once. The city doesn’t judge either way. It just keeps moving.

Every light is selling something. Every shadow is hiding something. And somewhere between the two, people convince themselves they’re choosing their lives instead of renting them one bad decision at a time.

I’ve seen the best and worst of it wear the same face. I’ve watched heroes become liabilities and monsters get promoted. I’ve seen miracles turned into prototypes and failures buried under paperwork.

If Night City teaches you anything, it’s this:

In Night City, you either bend… or you let it break you.

The rain never hit the windows all at once. It came in fits, like the city was breathing wrong.

My office was three floors up and one bad decision away from condemned. The neon across the street bled through the blinds in tired stripes; pink, blue, sickly white. Colors that looked better on skin than on concrete. The fan in the corner rattled like it was thinking about giving up. I didn’t blame it.

I was halfway through a cup of coffee that had lost the argument with time when Kassie spoke from the back room.

“You’re not gonna like this one.”

I never liked any of them. That was sort of the job description.

She leaned in the doorway, hoodie up, mask half-clipped at her collar like she’d forgotten it on purpose. Her eyes flicked across the room, already cataloging exits, reflections, shadows. Old habits. Some things don’t wash out, no matter how hard you scrub.

“What is it?” I asked.

She slid a shard across my desk. I didn’t touch it. Learned that lesson early. You let other people put things in your head in Night City, you don’t get to complain about the echoes.

“Missing persons,” she said. “But not the usual kind.”

I raised an eyebrow. That was my version of a sigh.

“Bodies are turning up stripped,” she continued. “Not mugged. Not harvested sloppy. Clean work. Cyberware removed like it was being returned.”

“Returned to who?”

Kassie shrugged. “That’s the fun part. Nobody’s claiming it.”

I finally picked up the shard, slotted it into the reader, and let the images flicker across the desk projector. Grainy alley footage. Blood washed pink by rain. A pair of eyes in one frame, glowing red just before the feed cut.

Urban legends traveled fast when the city didn’t have better explanations.

“They’re calling him Dr. Red,” Kassie said. “Like it’s a joke.”

“It won’t stay one,” I said.

She watched me carefully then. Kassie always did when things got close to old lines. The kind you don’t cross twice.

“You okay?” she asked.

I flexed my right hand under the desk. The tremor was subtle. Still there.

“Fine,” I lied.

A knock came at the door before either of us could say anything else. Three sharp raps. Controlled. Like someone who expected to be let in.

Kassie’s eyes went to the monitors. No hits. No tail. Clean.

I stood, joints protesting, and crossed the room. The neon caught my reflection in the glass, older than I felt, more tired than I admitted.

When I opened the door, the woman standing there looked like she’d practiced looking worried in the mirror until she got it right.

“William Grant?” she asked.

“That’s what it says on the door.”

She swallowed, just a fraction too late.

“I need your help,” she said. “It’s my brother.”

Behind me, the fan rattled harder.

The city had a way of sending things back around.

She sat like someone who had learned how to sit when people were watching.

Hands folded. Ankles crossed. Spine straight but not stiff. The kind of posture you got from boardrooms or waiting rooms where the furniture cost more than the people. Her coat was clean in a way Night City coats usually weren’t, the fabric too intact, the seams unfrayed. Even grief didn’t quite cling to her.

“I don’t know where else to go,” she said.

Kassie stayed quiet in the back, fingers dancing over an unseen keyboard. I didn’t need to look to know she was recording everything. Not for leverage. For pattern.

“How long has he been missing?” I asked.

“Three weeks.”

“Last contact?”

“A message. Short.” She hesitated, then added, “He said he needed time.”

That one landed wrong. Not enough to call it a lie. Just… polished.

“Name,” I said.

“Leon Stormborn.”

I let it sit there for a second. Some names carried weight. This one didn’t clang, but it didn’t float either.

“What did he do?”

“He was a doctor. Trauma. Cybernetics.” Her voice softened, practiced but not empty. “He always worked too much. Always thought he could fix things that were already broken.”

Kassie’s fingers paused.

“What kind of clinic?” I asked.

“Private. Discreet. I… I think he’s been taken.”

That word again. Discreet meant different things depending on who paid you to say it.

“You say he was taken,” I said. “But you also said he left.”

She frowned. Real this time, I thought. Or at least closer.

“I think he was scared,” she said. “And when people are scared in this city, they disappear.”

“That’s true,” I said. “But usually someone profits.”

She met my eyes. Held them.

“I just want him back.”

I nodded, like that settled something. It didn’t.

Kassie stepped forward then, resting a hip against the filing cabinet. Casual. Observant.

“So you’re the one that sent the shard, you said bodies were turning up,” Kassie said. “People with cyberware removed. You think that’s him?”

The woman’s breath caught, just barely.

“I think,” she said carefully, “he may be involved. But Leon wouldn’t hurt anyone unless he believed he had no choice.”

That was the second itch.

I leaned back in my chair. Let it creak. Let the silence stretch until it got uncomfortable.

“You’re telling me everything?” I asked.

Her shoulders slumped. Not dramatically. Just enough.

“I told you what matters,” she replied. “I can pay. And I can make sure you’re protected.”

That was the third itch. The bad one.

“Protected from what?” I asked.

She smiled, thin and fleeting. “Night City.”

Kassie glanced at me. Not alarmed. Just… alert.

I stood and walked to the window, watching neon smear itself across the rain.

“People who come in here usually want answers,” I said. “It seems that might not be what you want.”

She didn’t deny it.

When I turned back, she was already on her feet.

“Find my brother,” she said. “Before someone else does.”

She slid a cred chip onto the desk. The number on it was higher than it needed to be.

I didn’t touch it.

“Leave your contact,” I said.

She did. Clean. Encrypted. Corporate-grade.

When the door closed behind her, the fan finally gave up and died.

Kassie exhaled.

“She knows too much,” she said.

“Yeah,” I replied. “And not enough.”

Outside, the rain kept falling like it always did.

Somewhere in it, a doctor with red eyes was becoming a story people told each other when they wanted to feel less safe.

And I’d just agreed to go looking for him.

The city was easy to forget you whether you wanted it to or not.

I started with calls that didn’t ring long enough to be accidents. Names that used to pick up on the first buzz now waited three, four seconds too long. People checking who they were talking to before they decided if it was worth the risk.

Most didn’t answer at all.

The clinic Leon Stormborn had supposedly worked at had changed names twice in the last five years. That alone didn’t mean much. Everything in Night City shed skin when it got inconvenient. But when I finally got someone on the line who remembered the old sign, the pause on the other end went on long enough for me to hear breathing.

“That place shut down,” the voice said. Older. Tired. “Quiet-like.”

“Malpractice?” I asked.

“No,” he said. “Compliance.”

The line went dead.

I stared at the receiver for a second longer than necessary before hanging it up. My reflection in the cracked screen looked wrong around the edges, like it always did when the past reached up and tugged.

Kassie didn’t say anything. She didn’t need to.

Another call. A former NCPD tech who owed me a favor he never asked for. He answered with static and suspicion.

“You poking ghosts again, Grant?” he asked.

“Trying not to,” I said. “Clinic records. Leon Stormborn.”

A sharp inhale. Then, quieter, “That’s high profile case, you got permission for these files?”

“Wasn’t asking permission, calling in a favor.”

“Really?” he replied with sigh. “Fine, those files were pulled. Not deleted. Reassigned.”

“To who?”

A pause.

“That’s the thing,” he said. “Nobody I can see. They just… stopped being visible.”

I thanked him and cut the line before he could say anything else he’d regret.

Kassie looked up from her rig. “That’s not how normal erasure works.”

“No,” I agreed. “That’s how ownership does.”

The address came through ten minutes later. Not from the cops. From a street cam Kassie nudged awake like a sleeping animal. Alley footage flagged for sanitation but never cleared. Too expensive to clean properly. Too cheap to care.

We didn’t take the car all the way in. The alley smelled like copper and wet concrete, the air thick with ozone and something sweeter underneath. Neon from the street mouth flickered, trying and failing to reach the far end.

The body was already bagged, but nobody had bothered to move it yet.

NCPD tape hung loose, more suggestion than barrier. A pair of uniforms leaned against a wall nearby, pretending not to see us. One of them recognized me. Looked away.

I crouched near the outline where the body had been.

Clean cuts. Precise. Ports disengaged without tearing. Whoever did this hadn’t rushed. Hadn’t needed to.

“Cyberware?” Kassie asked softly.

“Selective,” I said. “Not everything. Just what mattered.”

“What mattered to who?”

I didn’t answer right away. My right hand trembled as I stood, the familiar buzz crawling up my arm like static under skin. I flexed my fingers until it quieted.

Across the alley wall, someone had sprayed a symbol in cheap red paint. Not a gang tag. Not a warning.

Just a pair of circles where eyes would be.

Kassie swallowed. “They weren’t robbed.”

“No,” I said. “They were corrected.”

The rain started up again, heavier this time, washing blood into the drains where the city liked to forget it existed.

Somewhere out there, Leon Stormborn was still working.

And someone very powerful wanted him found before he finished whatever he thought he was fixing.

Ripperdocs don’t like questions.

They like credits. They like time. They like plausible deniability. Questions make them start counting exits.

The first one waved me off before I finished the name.

“No,” he said. “Not interested.”

“I didn’t ask if you were,” I replied. “I asked if you’d seen this work.”

I slid a still across his counter. Clean extraction. Ports disengaged like they’d been unplugged, not torn out.

He didn’t touch it. Just glanced.

“That’s not street,” he muttered.

“Didn’t think so.”

He scratched at the chrome seam along his jaw. Old install. Bad fit. The kind you lived with because removing it would cost more than it was worth.

“Whoever did that,” he said, “they didn’t just know how. They knew when.”

“When what?”

“When the nervous system would stop fighting,” he said. “That timing? That’s medical.”

I nodded. Said nothing.

He leaned closer, voice dropping. “Tell whoever’s asking… I never saw them.”

“I’m the only one asking.”

“That’s worse,” he said, and shut the window between us.

The second clinic didn’t even pretend. Lights on. Door locked. A handwritten sign taped crooked across the glass:

NO REPAIRS. NO QUESTIONS.

Kassie read it from behind me. “That’s new.”

“Fear spreads faster than rumors,” I said.

We were halfway back to the car when my agent buzzed.

Unknown ID. Clean signal. Too clean.

I answered anyway.

“Mr. Grant,” the woman’s voice said. Calm. Pleasant. Familiar. “I hope I’m not interrupting.”

I stopped walking.

Kassie kept going, then slowed when she realized I wasn’t beside her anymore.

“I was just checking in,” the sister continued. “You said you’d keep me updated.”

“I said I’d contact you when I had something,” I replied.

A beat. Just one.

“Of course,” she said. “I just thought… given the urgency…”

“How urgent?” I asked.

Another pause. Longer this time.

“Have you found him yet?” she asked.

There it was.

Not if.

Yet.

“No,” I said.

“That’s unfortunate.”

I could hear something else on the line then. Not breathing. Not traffic. A room tone. Controlled space.

“You should be careful, Mr. Grant,” she added. “People doing this kind of work attract attention.”

“I’ve noticed.”

“I’d hate for this to become… complicated.”

The line went dead.

Kassie stared at me when I lowered the agent.

“She wasn’t asking how you were,” she said.

“No,” I agreed. “She was checking her watch.”

We drove in silence for a while after that. Neon sliding past. The city pretending it didn’t care who lived or died tonight.

Finally, Kassie spoke.

“She already knows he’s alive.”

“Yeah.”

“And she knows you’re close.”

I flexed my hand again. The tremor was worse now. Or maybe I was just paying attention.

“Good,” I said. “Means we’re looking in the right place.”

Kassie didn’t smile.

Somewhere between the clinics that wouldn’t talk and the woman who talked too much, the case stopped being about a missing doctor.

It became about who wanted him quiet and why they were starting to rush.

You could feel it when you were close.

Not like fear; fear was loud, jittery, all sharp edges. This was quieter. A pressure change. The way the air went flat before a storm decided where to land.

The address Kassie pulled didn’t exist on any current map. An old mixed-use block wedged between two redevelopment zones nobody could agree on. Half the building was lit, half of it pretending not to be. The city’s favorite compromise.

We didn’t go in through the front.

The stairwell smelled like antiseptic trying to cover rot. Old clinic smell. I paused halfway up, hand resting on the rail, chest tight for reasons that had nothing to do with the climb.

“You feel it too?” Kassie asked quietly.

“Yeah.”

That worried me more than if she hadn’t.

The apartment on the fourth floor was open. Door intact. Lock melted, not forced. Inside, the place had been stripped of anything that could be mistaken for comfort. No personal effects. No screens. Just equipment laid out with obsessive care.

Medical. Not flashy. Functional.

A body lay on the floor near the window. Male. Mid-thirties. Breathing shallow but still there. Barely.

I knelt beside him, careful not to touch anything I didn’t need to. The ports along his spine were empty; cleaned, sealed, treated. Someone had even closed the skin properly.

“This wasn’t a mugging,” Kassie murmured.

“No,” I said. “This was triage.”

My vision blurred for half a second. Data ghosts crawling at the edge of my sight. I squeezed my eyes shut until they retreated. The buzz in my arm was louder now, like something impatient.

“What was taken?” Kassie asked.

“Only what was killing him,” I said before I could stop myself.

She looked at me then. Really looked.

“You’ve seen this before.”

I didn’t answer.

Movement flickered in the reflection of the darkened window, not a shape, just distortion. Like heat shimmer where there shouldn’t have been any.

I stood slowly.

“Kassie,” I said, keeping my voice even. “Step back.”

The lights died.

Not all at once. One by one. Surgical. The room sank into shadow broken only by neon bleeding through cracked glass.

And then, just for a second, the window flared red.

Two points. Focused. Assessing.

Not angry.

Tired.

I felt it hit then. The recognition. The pattern clicking into place the way it used to on ops I didn’t like remembering. This wasn’t a man lashing out.

This was someone managing symptoms.

“Leon,” I said, not loud.

The red vanished.

By the time the lights stuttered back on, the room was empty of anything that didn’t belong to the patient or the past. No footsteps. No sounds retreating. Just absence, intentional and complete.

Kassie exhaled shakily. “He could’ve killed us.”

“He wasn’t here for us,” I said.

I moved back to the injured man, checked his pulse. Stronger than it had been.

“He saved him,” Kassie said.

I nodded. My hand was shaking now. Not subtle anymore.

“Yeah,” I said. “And it’s costing him.”

Sirens wailed somewhere far below, late to the party like always.

As we left, I caught my reflection in the stairwell mirror, older than before, eyes just a little too sharp.

Leon Stormborn wasn’t a monster.

He was a man losing a war he understood better than anyone else.

And now that I knew what I was looking at, I wasn’t sure the city could survive him being stopped",2,1770430572.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

The flights are already booked for 11th to the 27th of March. Also have prebooked cancellable hotels for the trip with the current idea being (overlapped days are travel and half days):

11 to 13 - Tokyo - Arriving late, no real plans apart from coffee and food the next day and wander some lesser visted area of Tokyo with my camera.

13 to 16 - Nagano - I think I am set on going here, currently for snow monkies, Obuse and the Hokusai Museum , Togakushi Shrine, and Zenkoji. I am unsure if early-mid March would be snowy or just cold and if that matters? Also considering extending Nagano by a day to visit Matsumoto for the castle, frog street and wasabi farm. Any thoughts greatly appreciated.

Then the following I am less sure about:

16 to 19 - Kanazawa - Kenroku-en, Nagamachi Samurai District, Omicho Market

19 to 23 - Osaka - Kyoto (been before but missed a few things so daytrip able), Himeji, Kobe

Ending the trip in Tokyo with at least a few days, mix of exploring the city again and day trips. If I get to see the Sakura blossoming that would be nice but not a must see for me.

23 to 27 - Tokyo - Kamakura, Yokohama, Hakone, leaving late on the last day.

However I am unsure about if these are the best areas for the time of year and open to suggestions. Everything apart from flights can be changed.

Also since my first trip was the golden route which included lots of Kyoto, Osaka, and Tokyo with day trips to Nara, Hiroshima, and Miyajima I am tossing up if I should go somehwere else like Nagoya instead of Osaka?

I like more relaxed trips, prefer to spend several nights in a place rather than just one, and not looking to pack the iternary with stuff but would love to hear any suggestions of where I could go instead.

My name is Sam (31, male, from USA) I got awarded Sabbatical at work and am going to travel abroad for the first time. I will be bringing one 40L travel backpack, and a personal item. I plan on brining camera gear because I want to try my hand at documenting and sharing my travels. I am intrigued and excited by extreme weather and intense climates, so the heat doesn't worry too much (except insofar as I wont get to wear my fav threads) 

I would like some advice on my proposed itinerary, suggested places of interests, must do, tourist traps. The main things I'm looking for are what are the countercultural neighborhoods (politically, aesthetically, punk, art, even just hip, etc) to stay in. What are unique inns, hostels and hotels that are worth staying at? What museums and social/historically important sites are worth visiting? Coffee shops, co-operatively owned businesses and important cultural neighborhood institutions (like galleries, restaurants, shops, etc). Advice on where to meet young, cool people. Super unique vintage (or new) clothing stores. Other cool, hip oddities. 

Should i cut vietnam? Should I add more counties? How long should i stay in each destination, what would “overdoing it” look like. 

**Dates: May 26 - August 14**

**Current Proposed Itinerary:**

**Japan** (two weeks) (Tokyo, Kyoto/Osaka, Fujimi)

**China** (two weeks) (Beijing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong)

***Vietnam*** *(one week) (maybe go to Vietnam, maybe spend a third week in china. Advice?)*

**Thailand** (two weeks) (Bangkok, islands?)

**Malaysia** (one week) (KL)

**Italy** (three weeks) (Rome, Florence, Genova) 

**Budget:** Solidly middle ground here. I am lower-middle class, with no kids. I don't have tens of thousands of dollars to blow. But I will spend what i need to spend to have a good time. I want to stay in cheap(ish) quirky, traditional, modest hotels, inns, hostels (that don't foreground partying), I also plan on staying with with comrades and friends. I plan on eating out for all my meals, and getting coffee daily. I will shell out for attractions, like tickets to shows, admission to places, and donation-based attractions.  
  
 **Interests/Passions:** I am a community organizer professionally and in my personal life, so I would like to visit revolutionary social centers and spaces, museums on social and political history, art/punk/queer/young people scenes, I like to dance. I like cycling, coffee and meeting new people. I am a recovered drinker, so I don't want to revolve my travels around drinking opportunities. I'm interested in local histories, religious history, art and fashion. I also plan on visiting spas, bathhouses and massage parlors to care for my body. I really like Korean Spas and Russian Baths in the US for example.

I've already done some in depth comparisons about the [batteries, temperature](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutinNano/comments/1q02zh6/nano_vs_mino_battery_and_temp_test/) and using [pre-ground coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutinNano/comments/1q4v9jf/nano_vs_mino_preground_coffee/).

Both machines make really good espresso and if you're looking for a portable espresso machine, either one will be a great addition to your routine. If you only plan on using Nespresso pods, either machine is great. Choose based on size and/or current sale price.

**Reasons to buy the Mino**: If portability and travel are your main priority, the Mino is likely for you. It quite a bit smaller (height wise), weighs a little less and makes much better espresso with without the need for a grinder. Because the Mino has a 12g *pressurized* basket, it works great with pre-ground coffee or coffee with a low end grinder. The battery does have a bit more capacity as well. If using water a little over room temp, you'll get an extra brew out of the Mino.

Note: Currently there isn't an option from Outin to use 18g of coffee in the Mino. So if that is a requirement for you, maybe consider the Nano. Hopefully they will release a larger basket for the Mino soon. There is a 3d print option to use the Outin Nano Basket Plus, but that isn't an option for everyone.

**Reasons to buy the Nano**: If you are, or plan to become, a coffee enthusiast get the Nano *with* the Basket Plus. To get the most out of it you also need at least a decent grinder, but that can be worked up to. The nano with the Basket Plus has the potential to rival a $300-500 espresso machine when pared with a decent grinder. It took me months with my Lelit Anna semi-auto espresso machine before I could make a better cup of espresso than the Nano. Working with the Nano, it only took me a couple of shots to dial it in.

Don't get me wrong. The Nano can still be used for travel, and the Mino still makes great espresso. This is just how I would break the tie between the two machines.

**TLDR:** Nano with Basket Plus is a great buy for the coffee enthusiast willing to also invest in a grinder. Mino is ideal for getting a great cup of espresso while traveling even if you have to buy pre-ground coffee.",4,1770430461.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1qy1apr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1qy1apr/26m_extremely_lonely_and_feeling_like_im/,"26M, extremely lonely and feeling like I'm fundamentally broken. How do I turn my life around?","I feel like I've been stuck in the same place mentally and emotionally for years. I don't mean just feeling a bit lost. I mean long-term loneliness and isolation that's slowly worn me down to the point where I barely recognise myself anymore.

I've been working the same dead-end minimum wage job for seven years now, since I moved here. In all that time, I haven't made a single friend. Not one. Not even a work acquaintance I could grab a coffee with. I am completely, utterly alone.

My days are mostly empty and unstructured. I wake up at 3 or 4 PM, doomscroll for hours, feel like shit, go to work where I interact with nobody, come home, repeat. I have no hobbies, no social life, nothing interesting about me whatsoever. Over time I've become more withdrawn and stuck in my own head. The loneliness has been there for a long time, but it's gotten worse in the last few years. I keep thinking this phase will pass on its own, but it never really does.

Last year I tried to put myself out there more. I socialised more than I had in years. But instead of helping, it often made me feel worse. I felt like I was on the outside of everything, like everyone else knew how to be normal adults and I didn't. People had stories, friends, relationships, hobbies, lives. I felt underlived, boring, slow, awkward. I can't articulate my thoughts properly. My brain just doesn't seem to work right when I'm talking to people. I'm either saying something stupid and regrettable or I'm completely silent. After hangouts I would go home and spiral, replaying conversations and feeling ashamed of how I came across. I genuinely started to believe there was something wrong with me socially, that I was too weird or too dull for people to really connect with.

I've felt this depressed for a while now. A lot of it comes from this constant sense of shame, feeling like I've wasted my twenties, disappointed my parents, and fallen behind everyone around me. I wake up most days feeling heavy and unmotivated, and it's hard to imagine things getting better. I hate admitting this, but there have been periods where I've had passive suicidal thoughts, mostly because the loneliness makes me feel like this is just how my life is going to be forever.

There was also a girl last year. She liked me, and I liked her a lot too. But I lied about parts of my life because I was ashamed of where I was at. Told her I had a proper job, friends, travel stories, hobbies, all bullshit to hide how empty my life actually was. When it became clear she wanted something serious, I told her we shouldn't date. At the time I thought I was doing the right thing. I didn't want to build something on lies or drag her into my mess. But I carry a lot of guilt about it now. I keep thinking I ruined something good because I couldn't believe anyone would genuinely want me once they saw the real version of me.

Since then, the loneliness has felt even sharper. She was the only person who made me feel less alone, and now I can't stop thinking about her.

I find myself wondering if I'm just doomed to be alone because of who I am, too quiet, too awkward, too behind in life. I know that sounds dramatic, but it's honestly how it feels some days.

I look in the mirror and hate what I see. I've gained weight, I'm going bald, I look tired all the time. I compare myself to everyone constantly and always come up short. I feel like there's something fundamentally broken in my brain, like I'm just wired to be alone and socially defective.

I do have a grad job lined up in a few months, but that feels so far away and I feel like I'm drowning right now. I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't want to spend the rest of my twenties feeling stuck, ashamed, and disconnected from everyone. I want to change, but I genuinely don't know where to start or how people rebuild themselves when they feel this far gone. Every time I try to fix things I lose momentum within days.

If anyone has been in a similar place, long-term loneliness, depression, feeling socially broken, and managed to come out the other side, I'd really appreciate hearing how you did it. I just want to know that this isn't permanent.",3,1770430356.0,DecidingToBeBetter,4,1.0,False

Not only that, I'm looking for open discussion, critiques, and feedback to improve in my line of thinking and articulation. Disclaimer: the following is my **opinion** formed by **observations**.   
  
On February 2nd, I was fired from my job, and I am in no way ashamed to admit why. This job provided me with the income I currently need to support myself through college. I am 100% financially independent and receive no help in any way from family. I pay for my own rent, car insurance, utilities, groceries, and so forth. 

For context, I was hired on at a local coffee shop in early January, so I was still a new employee. During my interview, the owner informed me that tips are withheld for 10 shifts and asked me if I was fine with that. I said yes, as I was under the impression this was standard for training periods. On my first shift, I got along with everyone quite well. While getting to know my new coworkers, most of whom were ages 21-28 (Gen Z), they all had the same complaint: the owner and co-owner (husband and wife) are incredibly passive-aggressive and retaliatory, warning me to fly under their radar. As training progressed, I realized that I had successfully picked up all of the skills needed to perform the required (tip-related) duties. 

After watching hundreds of customers tip $2-3 per order, at the end of my 10th shift, looking forward to my $50-$100 in tips, I asked management about how tips would be paid out. Management denied me tips for that shift due to a shift I had called out days prior (I had a genuine family emergency). Feeling slightly frustrated and confused by this, I naturally searched the legality of withholding tips. After a quick Google search, I find out that “under federal and California law, it is illegal for employers, managers, or supervisors to withhold, take, or deduct any portion of employee tips for themselves, as tips are considered the sole property of the employee.” Furthermore, I find out that it is entirely illegal to withhold tips during a “training period” or “probation period” if an employee is conducting “tip-related duties.” 

Upon finding this out, I calculated the average number of coffee cups served and the average amount of tips given since the day I was hired. It turns out that not only does the coffee shop owe me $500-$900 (literally my rent) in back pay, but they also owe every employee, current and former, their back pay as well. Professionally and kindly, I brought this up to the owners over text, in which they informed me that they will get back to me once they speak to their attorney. About 2 hours later, the work schedule updates, and unsurprisingly, my hours went from 24-32 hours/week to 12 hours. I immediately messaged the owners asking for clarification whether my decline in hours was due to business needs or if such a decision was temporary. The owners replied, claiming the drop in hours was due to my lack of availability. I replied with a screenshot of my approved availability, stating that my school schedule does not begin until late-February. The co-owner replied, “Will reflect the following week.” The next shift, I was informed by the owner that they “decided not to move forward” with me, firing me. I have since filed a wage claim, a retaliation complaint, and almost immediately gained employment elsewhere. 

However, I tell this story not only to clearly lay out the faults of the labor system, but also to criticize my co-workers not only for their inability to stand up in the name of justice for themselves and others, but also for their conformity in the flawed labor system they are so strongly against. Apart from the three new employees (including myself), the rest of the employees have been employed at the coffee shop for 1.5 to 3 years. Despite their constant complaints of being mistreated and retaliated against by the owner, not one employee thought to conduct research, seek legal advice, or take action against such injustices. 

I strongly believe that my co-worker’s actions, or lack thereof, are indicative not only of Gen Z’s inability to stand up to unjust systems, but is revealing of their “all bark no bite” mentality and hypocrisy on the digital landscape. Although getting fired was a stressful experience, the insight I gained was invaluable. Although this may appear obvious, it has become apparent to me that what is holding back Gen Z from changing the systems they disapprove of is simply their fear of confrontation, consequences, and, most notably, awkwardness and social interaction, directly contradicting the vast majority of Gen Z’s claims online. 

Disclaimer: I am in no way suggesting people shouldn’t be afraid to be retaliated against, especially if you have dependents and other commitments. However, if you have no dependents and other commitments, and you openly claim to stand on principles, ethics, and social justice, and are afraid of retaliation, maybe you should reconsider what your values actually are, especially if you openly claim such values online. 

Online, Gen Z is known to be the most vocal about systemic change and advocating for equal rights. Most notably, Gen Z has been the most critical (digitally speaking) of the U.S.’s relationship to Israel, Palestine, and Iran. Furthermore, they call for the abolishment of ICE, the use of tariffs on foreign allies, and a whole list of other causes. On the digital landscape, Gen Z portrays itself as an advocate for political and societal change. However, from my perspective, as a Gen Z college student who grew up in the public education system, with both parents being public school teachers, attended both traditional and continuation high schools, has lived in Riverside, Irvine, and Los Angeles, CA, has led research projects, and club initiatives entirely made up of Gen Z, I can confidentally say that, in real life, the vast majority of Gen Z portray themselves as depressed, unenthusiastic, unmotivated, directionless, axious, overstimulated, overmedicated, unorganized, inarticulate, lack innitiative, and shamefully uneducated. 

The reason I find myself frustrated about Gen Z’s lack of education is that education has never been more accessible at any moment in human history. Throughout human history, the exclusivity of education has been weaponized and used to commit unjust acts and to systemically keep the working class and minorities from fighting back, and for the first time, the playing field is even. Through the invention of the internet, anyone, anywhere, at any time can access the world’s knowledge of culture, political science, history, anthropology, sociology, psychology, physiology, biology, physics, mathematics, etc. Famous political activists, such as Gandhi, MLK Jr., Nelson Mandela, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Cesar Chavez, Susan B. Anthony, and Vaclav Havel, just to name a few, would have killed to have access to such a vast amount of knowledge and reach. 

Despite this, Gen Z chooses to make use of such human ingenuity, not to organize and make social progress, but to brag about their status, to speak on issues they know nothing about, and to philosophically masturbate. Such qualities reflect much deeper underlying issues, in particular, the insatiable desire to be the “main character.” Although the internet is a tool that revolutionized productivity, social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok have taken over the digital economy, thus taking over the digital landscape as a whole. Through marketing tactics designed to target the physiology of Gen Z and Gen Alpha, tech giants have successfully conditioned the nervous systems of millions of youth to prioritize social status, self-image, and perceptual upkeep above everything else. Gen Z’s priorities have been so misaligned as a result of such conditioning that many would rather be unemployed than work in the fast food, sanitation, and retail industries, for example. simply because they are not “high-status” jobs. 

Furthermore, Gen Z’s prioritization of social status, self-image, and perceptual upkeep has led to the decline of their self-actualization. Due to Gen Z’s nervous system feeling the need to constantly perform, many have been forced into unnaturally developing metacognition, a high level of reflective self-awareness. Although most individuals naturally develop metacognition between the ages of 18 and 30, due to the maturation of the prefrontal cortex, the primary demographic of individuals who develop metacognition before the ages of 18 are often trauma survivors who were raised in emotionally abusive or unstable living environments. Meaning, as a result of chronic social media use, often referred to as “doom scrolling,” Gen Z and Gen Alpha are voluntarily subjecting their developing nervous systems to environments that only trauma survivors and mature adults are habituated to. 

Although there are few, the reason complex trauma survivors have so much resilience and mental fortitude is due to their incredibly strong nervous systems. If Gen Z truly wants to be the generation that changes society for the better, they must first regain control of their nervous system and learn to increase the threshold at which their perception of “survival” is limited. Increasing the strength and durability of one’s nervous system will increase resilience, self-confidence, endurance, and mental fortitude under real-world pressures, as these are all qualities the strongest and most effective political scientists and activists possess.",16,1770430212.0,ucla,12,0.84,False

that the ache would never leave me

that I would grow around it

like a tree swallowing a fence,

metal buried under bark,

still there, still shaping the trunk.

I prepared for a lifetime

of carrying you.

I rehearsed survival

the way people learn winters;

layer by layer, breath by visible breath,

telling myself some loves simply freeze inside you.

But time did something crueler

than staying.

It softened the edges.

One morning I noticed

I had made coffee

without remembering your voice.

The sky was just the sky.

A song ended

and I did not sit in the silence afterward

waiting for your name to echo.

Nothing dramatic,

no grand release,

no ceremony.

Just… less.

And that was when I panicked.

Because pain had been proof.

My grief was the last witness

that what lived between us

was real.

If the wound closes,

what testifies????

If my chest no longer tightens

at the places we almost became a life,

what remains of us???

I was never afraid

of hurting forever.

I was afraid

of healing.

Afraid I would wake one day

and discover my heart

had learned to beat

without asking for you.

Afraid peace

would feel like erasure.

Afraid the universe would quietly say,

“See? You continued.”

And I would whisper back,

Then what was all that love for?

But maybe meaning

was never stored in the pain.

Maybe it lives in who I became

while trying to hold something that would not stay.

Maybe love does not prove itself by how long it wounds us, but by how deeply it changed the shape of our hands, how they now hold the world more gently than before.

So if one day

your memory rests in me

without tearing anything open,

it will not mean

you didn’t matter.

It will mean

you were finally carried

to the only place love was ever meant to live;

not in the ache,

but in the person

I had to grow into

after you. 💌❤️‍🩹",3,1770429900.0,justpoetry,0,1.0,False
