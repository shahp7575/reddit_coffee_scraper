1kv3eun,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1kv3eun/advice_appreciated/,Advice appreciated,"Last weekend, my ex's sis and bro-in-law and their two kids were coming to our county (we reside in England) to visit him at his new house (we split up and he bought his own place and moved out- he also didn't tell me he was viewing properties or putting offers in and then just said all casually that he had bought a house and was moving out, then acted like I was nuts for being surprised by this and I wasn't allowed to express my confusion/ frustration that he'd been telling me he was elsewhere when he was viewing houses to potentially buy for months!), anyway... but since his sis' kids prefer me to him, they wanted us all to meet up. Before I knew it, my ex had said he was coming to my house early to do 2-3 weeks' worth of laundry and we would be preparing a picnic for everyone together. He hadn't asked this- just told me it was happening and that his sis and company would be arriving at mine between 10.30am and 11am, and that they would be visiting his new house later on after our long walk and picnic, before they headed off up the road again to go home. 

I felt anxious at how it would go and decided to face my fears and tell him so I said to him it wouldn't work for me, he pressured me for a reason so I was honest and said I'm working to identify and avoid my emotional triggers while I'm working to heal myself in therapy and one of those triggers is him and I in the kitchen (he always made me feel insecure and butted in when I was cooking/ prepping food) plus I didn't want a load of food mess to clean up when guests were coming to my place. 

Side note: His sis is lovely, and keeps an extremely clean and tidy, clutter free home so I wanted my place to be nice for their arrival and the kitchen mess would stress me out. Plus I had a very busy week at work so would appreciate a good sleep (wouldn't get that if stressing about him arriving in the morning and winding me up), especially as I've been anaemic recently so need more rest. Surprisingly, he thanked me for being honest with him and I offered to prepare part of the picnic to contribute so I was given fruit and dessert to sort out and did so. 

The day before we msgd a little back and forth about what I was planning for dessert and fruit, and I said I had been busy getting my place perfect for them coming and couldn't wait to see them. The next morning is the day of his sis coming and I have gotten up early after a late night of cleaning and tidying my place top to bottom. I sorted out my section of the picnic, got ready and was awaiting their arrival. 

His sis is very prompt usually so when 10.30 came and went I was surprised she hadn't arrived. I swept my patio and wiped down my garden furniture to pass the waiting time as I was a bit anxious and felt really tired so thought if I kept moving I wouldn't crash out. 11am then came and went and so I tried to ring his sis but couldn't get through, I figured she must be driving. Then I tried ringing my ex as he also hadn't arrived but again no answer. I waited longer. Then I tried ringing them both again and still couldn't get through. Then a bit later still, I get a text from my ex saying 'They should be arriving at mine soon.' 

I had this background lingering feeling that my a-hole ex would think of some petty way to try to get back at me -for not even doing anything bad or wrong and I was right. I msgd back 'Oh. I thought they were going to yours after. When are you coming here then?' He messaged back 30 mins later saying 'That was when I was coming to yours first.' (-avoiding not telling me when to expect their arrival). I replied 'Good of you to tell me'. And he immediately replied '\*My name\*, you asked me not to come' with a crying laughing emoji. I tried calling his sis to find out when to expect them but again, no joy getting through. Then when I tried later, she answered through car bluetooth as she was driving all of them, including my ex, and just as she answered she was pulling into my neighbourhood. 

I could've had a lie in, I could've gone to my friend's for coffee in the morning that invited me over, but no, I was waiting around for their/ his arrival like a twit. 

He asked me why I was being a bit short and not warm to him when we were out with all of them on our picnic and I snapped at him that he absolutely no respect for me and picks and chooses when to show me basic human decency and he said he disagrees and I replied that I was fucking done with him (we were away from the others). 

I was honest with his sis and said what he'd done and she said she was on her way to my house in the morning when he rang her to get her to divert her route to go to his first, assuming he'd told me of the changes to the plans. 

The next day he tried to ring me and I never answered and he went into my place (previously our place before he moved out, he still has keys as he owns it), went in and left some things which were mine from the picnic: tupperware, flask, cool packs etc with a cheery note and a smiley face (I was at a friend's house all day). He has tried phoning me a few times again since and yesterday left me a voicemail not addressing anything, just acting like everything is fine, asking how I am and telling me he's off to play golf with his friend further north then visiting his parents and asking what I'm up to. I haven't responded and don't want to. 

The problem is, it is his dad's bday in a few days and then his a couple days after that. If I'm not talking to him, are his fam gonna think badly of me for not sending him happy bday or a card? What do you think I should do? I've written his dad one and am posting it today. I bought my ex his fave local cider which is expensive and you can only get it a couple times a year here and some fancy cheddar a few weeks' ago in anticipation of his bday coming up, so I can fall back on that and give him it. However he is a gaslighting dickhead so hmmmm... 

Also, I understand how others could see this and think how is someone a narc for this- well he's not a narc for this alone and actually don't even think he is a narc but he definitely has narc tendencies and this is just one small example of a larger picture of a continuous pattern of emotional invalidation, and gaslighting (among other things). 

Any advice would be appreciated and I'm definitely looking for validation as I know I will never get that from him, nor will I ever get an apology from him (never have, for anything), and he will never face himself, he has a fragile ego and always blames other people/ things and will never take accountability. I guess a big part of me writing this is to get things off my chest and another is so that if someone else reads this out there and can understand what I'm going through and see that most narc behaviour isn't overt, it's very subtle and covert and takes years to spot and by the time you do, you're so cognitively exhausted and confused that it's hard to face up to and get out. It's easy to explain things away and make excuses for the other person who is making you mentally unwell and holding you back in your life. ",1,1748182089.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

The online casino scene is wild right now, and while I’m loving Lucky Ones, I want your take on whether it’s truly the Best Online Casino Canada Reddit can vouch for, or if there’s something even better out there. I’m a fan of slots (progressive jackpots get my heart racing), Texas Hold’em poker, and live dealer blackjack for that Vegas-at-home vibe. Bonus points for fast payouts, crypto options, and a mobile app that doesn’t crash mid-spin. So, let’s dive into what makes the Best Online Casino Canada Reddit recommends!

Here’s why Lucky Ones feels like the Best Online Casino Canada Reddit users might rave about, plus my wishlist for any other contenders:

• Trustworthy & Licensed: Lucky Ones has solid licensing (I believe it’s Curacao, but correct me if I’m wrong), which gives me peace of mind. I need any casino to be legit with no shady vibes.

• Game Selection: Lucky Ones has a massive library—slots like Mega Moolah and Starburst, plus table games and niche stuff like Aviator. What other casinos match this variety?

• Bonuses & Promos: Lucky Ones hooked me with a juicy welcome bonus and free spins, stretching my Canadian dollars. Got other sites with killer cashback or loyalty programs?

• Fast Payouts: Lucky Ones gets my winnings to me quick, often within a day via Interac or crypto. Any casinos faster than this?

• Mobile Experience: The Lucky Ones app is smooth for gaming on my phone while chilling at a Winnipeg coffee shop. How’s the mobile game elsewhere?

• Canadian-Friendly: Lucky Ones makes deposits/withdrawals easy for Canucks with Interac, MuchBetter, and BTC. What other casinos nail this?

I’m curious what you all think—especially fellow Canadians or Winnipeggers! Is Lucky Ones the Best Online Casino Canada Reddit has been hyping, or do you have another fave for slots, poker, or live dealer games? Any must-have welcome bonuses or loyalty perks I should know about? And super important: any casinos to steer clear of due to slow payouts or bad support?

A bit about me: I’m not a high roller, just a regular dude who loves a few spins after work, a poker night with friends, or the occasional live roulette session. I play with $50-$100 a month, so budget-friendly casinos with low minimum deposits are my jam. If you’ve got promo codes, referral links, or insider tips for Canadian players, drop them below! I’d love to hear what makes your go-to site the Best Online Casino Canada Reddit trusts.

Also, what’s the vibe for 2025? Are VR casinos legit yet? Any buzz about AI dealers or crypto-only platforms? I’m wondering if Lucky Ones or another site Reddit loves is leaning into these trends. And for my Winnipeg folks—any local gambling meetups or groups I should check out?

1kv32m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kv32m7/i_moved_into_the_manor_owned_by_my_universitys/,I moved into the manor owned by my university’s founder. The walls are starting to bleed. [Part 1],"Being accepted into Wescroft University was one of the best and worst things that has happened to me. It was my dream school, one where 95% of all graduates land successful music gigs. Unfortunately, due to its reputation, the tuition was a nightmare, making even the thought of living in the dormitories an unrealistic option. I had to look for off-campus options, but due to my late application, I found out too late that the most convenient ones are usually the first to go, so the pickings were slim. 

Stressed and frustrated, I sat on the steps leading to the campus. Though my heart clenched at the possibility, I could only think of one option left, and that was to drop out.

Before I could wallow in self-pity, my eyes drifted over to the campus directory, a large, wooden bulletin board with various flyers and posters plastered all over it. The papers billowed in the wind, torn and crumbled at the edges. That was when something caught my eye. The paper looked ancient—yellowed, crumpled, like something torn from a forgotten will. The text was written with a brilliant hand, each letter painfully deliberate, each word a perfect, neat line.

""Housing available, roommate needed. Large home with many rooms. Prices start at $500. Inquiries can be sent to 15, East Lake Drive.""

That was the address of the Holloway manor. The building was owned by the Holloways, the family that established and supported the school financially. With so many buildings named after them, it's puzzling why their living quarters were accessible to outsiders. My first instinct was to assume it was a scam, but desperation and a bit of optimism drove me to follow up on this ad anyway, just to make sure.

The trek wasn't the shortest, but it was also serene, as it went through a more natural path, giving me a great view of the lake. It was an impressive sight, huge and crystal blue, with water so clear you can see everything at the bottom. Despite its size, the lake was barren—no fish, no plants, not even insects.

Looming at the far edge, casting its reflection across the glassy water, was the manor. I stood in awe at the sheer size of this thing. It looked ancient, like it was from the turn of the 20th century. The condition left much to be desired, with cracked, rotting wood, moss and ivy growing over every surface, and chipped paint. A splotch of black on the side of the building caught my attention, which I recognized as the remnants of a fire. I knew I should've been scared or, at the very least, unnerved by the sight of this place. But instead, I found it fascinating. I guess the artist in me has a strange admiration for all things eerie.

I took a deep breath, my heart racing with both excitement and a tinge of trepidation. This could either be the solution to my problems or a complete waste of time. I made my way up the steps leading to the front door.

There was no doorbell, just a brass knocker in the center of the frame that looked like it was one bad tug away from crumbling. I didn't want to break the thing and have them sue me for the door, so I decided to just knock. I waited. The rustling leaves of the greenery around me drew my attention to the tree that seemed to be closing in on the property. It encased the house, wrangled branches reaching out like desperate arms to prevent any ray of sunlight from peeking through. Noon might as well be dusk for this place. As I leaned in to get a better look at the gnarled wood, I noticed that it had a distinct shade of crimson. I was by no means an expert on flora, but I didn't think that was a natural colour. Must've been a rich people thing, I concluded.

""Hello?"" I was so entranced by the surrounding forest that the simple word was enough to cause me to flinch. Turning around, I saw a sunken blue eye peering from behind a crack in the door. I couldn't tell much about the girl on the other side, as the inside seemed pitch black. All I could see was her right eye, the corner of her chapped lips, and a set of pale fingers curled tightly around the door frame. Her skin was nearly translucent, faint blue veins webbed just beneath the surface. Her hair, long and blonde to the point of white, spilled over half her face like ink bleeding through paper.

""Oh, hi,"" I said, flashing my best smile, hoping to seem as friendly as possible, ""I saw the ad you posted on the campus directory and was wondering if you had an opening?""

The girl kept quiet, thin eyebrows faintly furrowing. Then, as if remembering something, her eyes widened, and the door swung open, and I got a better look at her. She seemed my age, but considering the state of her appearance, I couldn't really tell. Her skin was that pale, and it wasn't just because of the lack of light. I'm not sure what caused it, but she looked malnourished, her bones and veins visible underneath that sallow complexion. It made her look fragile, sickly, yet there was an underlying beauty to her, not dissimilar to the manor itself.

Most curious of all were her eyes. Once I got past the deep bags obscuring them, I could make out a vibrant blue hue, and when the light hit them right, the irises seemed to shimmer with an unnatural quality that reminded me too much of the empty lake.

""The ad, yes..."" She murmured, bringing a lithe thumb to her dry lips and gnawing on it absent-mindedly. ""Would you like to come in?"" I had to strain my ears to hear the words that fell from her lips.

In an awkward side shuffle, she moved aside, giving me room to step in. I entered the manor, and the first thing that struck me was how dark and empty the space was. There was furniture, sure, but it was scarce. A few tables, a chair, a bookshelf. Nothing else. I guess she wasn’t a fan of interior design. Speaking of, the girl seemed to have vanished, the sounds of shuffling coming from the room next over. She emerged holding a tray with two cups of tea, which she placed on the coffee table.

""Please sit down,"" she said softly, and I complied. As I sat, I noticed her eyes darting from my face to the chair. Her delicate fingers pushed the ceramic teacup closer to me, and I took a look at the contents inside. The brew was a dark gray colour with hints of green that gave off the faint smell of the sea. The sulphuric scent made my nose twitch, with a faint undertone of rust. I took a sip of the tea and found it to have a similar metallic tang, along with a texture that made the liquid cling to the sides of my mouth. It was strange and unusual, but I didn't want to seem rude. I forced myself to swallow it down, trying not to grimace too hard at the taste.

I felt a lump form in the back of my throat, and for a second, I thought that I was going to throw up. Instead, I managed to choke out, ""Thank you. Nothing like a cup of strong tea to get the day started! What kind of leaves did you use, anyway?"" The girl didn't respond. She was staring at me, her expression unreadable. After a moment of silence, she finally spoke.

""Oh. Mint, I think,"" Her voice came out raspy and strained, like she hadn't used it in a century. Setting down the cup of hopefully not fatal tea, I extended my hand to her.

""By the way, I'm Julian! Nice to meet you."" It took her a second to process the gesture, and when she did, she placed her thin fingers into mine and gave a weak handshake. Her cold digits felt like ice in my hand.

""My name is Eden,"" Eden murmured, before quickly adding on, ""Holloway. It's nice to meet you, too, Julian."" Another period of silence. She didn't seem all that great at keeping conversations alive, but that wasn't a big deal to me.

""So, Eden,"" I began, leaning forward in the chair, ""Are you a student at Wescroft?""

""No, no, I'm not currently pursuing higher education. I am homeschooled, so to speak,"" She replied, her voice still soft, yet more confident and articulate than before.

""Anyone else living here?"" She shook her head. ""Really? Isn't this house a bit big for just one person?"" She shrugged her shoulders. This wasn't going anywhere. ""Any competitors I have to fight for the spot?""

""No,"" Eden finally spoke, ""You're the first to respond. I've had it up for a year now."" Pity stabbed at my heart; it sounded like she was lonely. Considering how awkward she was, the poor thing must've had trouble socializing.

""Well, don't worry,"" I gave her a comforting smile. ""I'm here now, and I'd like to be your new roommate!"" She gave me a strange look. Like a deer in headlights.

""Are you sure? You don't want a tour?"" She asked. I laughed at her response. It was cute how much she underestimated the desperation of the average college student.

""Listen, I'm not exactly in a position to be picky. You seem like a lovely girl, and the price is perfect. It just needs a little fixing up, but I can handle that."" I grinned at her. She didn't respond, but the faintest of smiles tugged at the corners of her lips. I took that as a sign that I’d won her over. ""It's 500 dollars a month, right?""

""Yes,"" Eden paused, dark eyes searching the sky for the answer, ""I can lower it. 200. If you're comfortable."" I stared at her, dumbfounded. She was already selling herself short, and now she was willing to lower the price even further? This was too good to be true, but I didn't want to take advantage of her kindness. Then again, I was in a tight spot, and 200 a month was practically a steal for such a large place.

""A-are you sure? I thought 500 was already too low! I mean, look at this house, it's huge! Are you sure you can afford to go that low?""

""Money isn't a concern. This is my family's estate.""

""Right, the Holloways,"" I noted, eyebrows furrowed in thought. ""Then why do you need a roommate?""

The rim of the cup stopped a hair short of her lips. She hesitated. Her eyes flitted to the floor. ""It gets lonely. Here. Alone."" The words fell from her lips in a soft whisper, clattering and disjointed. That was all the explanation I needed.

“Alright, guess that’s that then!” I clapped my hands together, ""I'll move in as soon as possible.""

That seemed to make her happy, because the ghost of a smile returned to her lips, and the faintest hint of blue crept onto her pale cheeks.

""Oh, uh, I am gonna be playing a lot of music. Is that gonna be-""

""Music is fine,"" She answered a little too quickly. ""You can play whenever you want. The house tends to keep sounds in. The walls are thick. I won't hear much. And I like music.""

""Awesome!"" I beamed, standing up and extending my hand for another shake. Making sure not to accidentally crush the bones in her hands into dust by putting too much force, I gave her a firm shake. ""Looking forward to rooming with you, Eden!""

She didn’t say anything—just watched me with that almost-smile as I stood up and walked to the door. I waited by the entrance, giving her a chance to see me off, but Eden just continued to blink, a slight tilt in her head.

""Right, uh..."" I cleared my throat. ""I'm gonna go back to the campus to grab my things. It's not much, just a few bags and a suitcase, but I'll be back by tomorrow morning.""

""Okay,"" She repeated. I waited for a few more moments to see if she'd say anything else, but after a solid minute of her doing nothing but blinking at me, I decided to take my leave. She was... A little weird, but if bad tea and a staring problem was the worst I was going to get, I was pretty sure I was set.

It was dusk when I left, and the smell of the lake was overwhelming. Though the aftertaste of the tea remained, the sight of the lake distracted me. The sun was just starting to set, painting everything in a warm glow that contrasted heavily with the cold air.

I wouldn’t mind seeing this sight every time I returned home from a tiring day at school, I thought.

The next day, I quickly packed up all my belongings, bid my goodbyes to overpriced takeout and drab, concrete walls, and made my way back to the manor. I didn’t even reach the first step before the door swung open with a swift yet grating creak. Out came Eden, dressed in the same clothing from yesterday, hands clasped politely in front of her. The ends of her lips twitched up periodically, as if she were having difficulty maintaining a smile. She leaned forward, yet never made the effort to ever step foot outside.

""You're back,"" Eden stated.

""Well, of course,"" I grinned, lugging my suitcase up the stairs, ""You can't get rid of me that easily.""

Her eyes widened, and I could see her hands tense, their grip tightening. ""Who... I don't want to get rid of you. I'd never do that."" The way she said it should've been endearing, but I couldn't help but feel like she was trying to persuade me more than anything else.

""Oh, no, no, I didn't mean it literally,"" I chuckled, waiting for her to move aside so I could come through. But, she didn't. She just stood there, staring at me. ""It's a joke, er, an expression. I just mean that I'm not leaving."" Her shoulders relaxed, and she finally stepped aside to let me in. ""Anyway, mind showing me my room?”

""Right. Of course."" She mumbled, ""Right this way."" Eden guided me towards the living room, where the two of us had spoken. ""This is the living room. You've already seen it. There's a bathroom to the left. You haven't."" I nodded, making mental notes. ""And that's the kitchen. That's where the food is."" As she showed me around, I couldn't help but notice that the curtains were drawn, keeping most of the natural light out. Not only that, but there weren't any lights on, which made the house feel even more eerie.

""A little dark in here... Not a fan of the light?"" She turned abruptly, pausing near one of the thick curtains. Gingerly, she pulled it aside, letting what little light there was spill through. Branches obscured the view, giving the whole thing an even more haunted look. ""Ah... Well, you can keep them closed, if you want."" With a curt nod, she pulled it closed and continued. That was when I spotted a door off to the side, tucked away in a corner.

""What's in there?"" I asked, gesturing to the door. She looked at it, and her expression changed.

""Basement. It's messy. I haven't gone down in a while. Most certainly houses insects and critters. Probably mold and fungus. Maybe even rot. It's very old."" She spoke with that strange cadence of hers, each word rolling off her tongue like a pebble falling from a cliff side. ""You don't want to see it."" It wasn't a suggestion, nor even a command. It was just a fact.

""Fair enough,"" I shrugged, following behind her again. She led me up the stairs, and I found myself standing in a hallway. It was long and narrow, with doors lining both sides.

""This is your room. Third door on the right,"" She said, stopping in front of my room. She opened it for me, and I was greeted with a fairly simple interior. Or, at least, it looked simple from a cursory glance. It contained a twin-sized bed, a wooden desk, and a modest closet, things every bedroom should have. But the more I looked at it, the more its oddities emerged. Beige walls with peeling wallpaper and a ceiling that felt several inches too short. I approached the desk, tracing my fingers over its surface to find it, surprisingly, not dusty. Eden must have cleaned it, or at the very least wiped it down. Still, the wood had nicks and cuts, the drawers were a little crooked, and the hinges were rusted.

However, all of that paled in comparison to the sight. The large windowsill overlooked the lake, giving a spectacular view of the clear, still waters, as well as the surrounding forest. I could feel my breath being taken away as I gazed out at the scenery. It was stunning.

""Do you like it?"" Her voice broke me out of my reverie. I turned to her with an excited grin.

""Eden, it's perfect,"" I said, placing my luggage down and walking over to her, still facing the window. ""I love it. Great view, as well. I'm glad those branches aren't covering it like they do the rest of the place."" I joked, turning to face her. My smile immediately faltered when I saw the look in her eyes. Wide, anxious, as if I'd just said something that had deeply unsettled her. Her eyes flicked to the water—but only for a second. Then, like a guilty habit, she looked away, condemning herself from the view.

""What's wrong?"" I asked, concerned. ""Is there a problem? Was it the branch joke? Sorry, that wasn't-""

""I'm glad you like it,” Eden suddenly interjected, shifting her weight from foot to foot. ""I'll leave you to unpack."" And with that, she turned and left, leaving me alone in the room. I stared at the open door for a moment, before turning to my luggage and getting to work.

A few hours later, I had unpacked everything, and I was sitting on the bed, looking out the window. It was so peaceful, and the view was so calming. The type of scenery perfect for inspiring art. In fact, a burst of creativity surged through me right then and there, and I opened the case to my violin. My pride and joy. Cradling it like an infant, I took a seat by the window, letting the natural light wash over me.

Setting the bow atop the strings, I took a deep breath and drew the bow. A jarring twang cut through the air, and I physically flinched. That's not right. I had just tuned it to perfection the day before, and yet here it was, no different than the sound of nails on a chalkboard. Bowing the other strings yielded similar results, each one a high-pitched screech. It was as if the strings were broken. It didn't sound like when they were untuned, or if I had the wrong note, either. The sounds were clear and crisp. Just... Wrong. Like the walls rejected the note and spat it back at me with disdain.

I rested the violin on my lap and let out a slow, frustrated breath. I didn’t want to believe it was damaged, not this violin. Not the one that had been with me through every recital, every sleepless night of practice.

So I stood, brushing the dust from my pants, and made my way to the door. The second I cracked it open, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Eden was standing inches from the door frame, the shadows of the manor casting her in a ghastly light that seemed to make her sunken features sink even further.

""W-wow, um, hey, Eden! Good, uh, good evening."" I chuckled, hoping that my voice wasn't shaking.

""Good evening,"" She echoed, her head tilted to the side. ""Is something wrong? You don't sound happy.""

""It’s nothing, just my violin's been acting up. I have no idea what's wrong with it,"" I raised the back of my finger to my lips, gently biting the knuckle. Her blue eyes trailed to the act before rising back to meet my gaze.

""Oh. Yes. It doesn't respond well to music. The house, that is. I think it might have absorbed most of the noise.""

""Absorbed? What do you mean?"" I asked.

""The structure is not normal. Hollow, I think. Doesn't respond well to sounds. Especially music. The living room is the best place to play, I believe. It's large enough for the sound to travel freely.""

""Huh. Okay. Thanks, Eden."" She didn't say anything, she just stared. It wasn't a threatening stare, nor was it malicious. ""Did you need anything else?""

""No, I'm fine,"" She replied, ""...If you want to see if the living room is better, then I could join you."" It took me a moment that this was her roundabout way of asking to hear me play. I smiled and nodded, taking the violin with me.

""Sure, sounds great!"" She smiled back, albeit a bit awkwardly, and we made our way down the stairs. The living room was still empty, with the curtains drawn. I took a seat on the couch and set the violin on my lap. ""So, what would you like me to play?"" I asked, looking at her. Eden placed a few logs of wood into the fire pit, striking two pieces of flint together until a small fire roared. She didn't even look at me when she answered, just kept her eyes fixed on the fire.

""Something pleasant, would be nice.""

Pleasant. Right. I had a few pieces in mind, and the bow touched the strings. The melody filled the room, and I felt a wave of relief wash over me. The house didn't distort the sound in the living room, like Eden had suggested. Well, not entirely at least; though not as loud, I could still hear the notes being thrown back at me, a tinny and faint imitation of the original. The music was clear and crisp, and I could feel the vibrations of the notes travel up my arm. The warm light of the flames danced on the instrument, and the orange tinted glow of the room gave the whole thing a nostalgic feel. It was as if the whole room had been bathed in the soft glow of a memory. The music flowed from my fingertips and filled the room, filling every nook and cranny. When the piece was done, I lowered my violin and looked at Eden, who was staring at the bonfire intently, eyes wide and unfocused.

That was when I saw the tears, rolling down her cheeks like dewdrops on a leaf. They left a dark trail across her pale cheeks, nearly getting caught in the concave dips of her sunken face. ""Eden? Are you okay?""

""N-no. Well, yes."" Eden cleared her throat, looking away and rubbing her cheeks with her sleeve. ""I don't have the privilege of listening to music all that often, and I was simply moved by the piece. You're a very talented musician. Thank you for that."" Though her words were genuine, I couldn't help but feel like there was more to the tears. She was hiding something, I knew it. But I didn't want to pry.

I chuckled, shaking my head. ""It was my pleasure, really. Thank you for allowing me to play. If you ever want another performance, I'd be more than happy to oblige!""

""Oh, I wouldn't want to impose on you.""

""Trust me, there's no reward better for a musician than a happy audience."" I grinned, and she paused, eyes flicking across my features, looking for... Something. When she didn't find it, that bittersweet smile returned to her face, the ends of her lips not reaching her face, and her eyebrows crinkling.

""Thank you, Julian."" She stood up once more and put out the fire. All the life and colour that was once in the living room was snuffed out in an instant, swallowed by the dark. With a gentle bow, she ascended up the flight of stairs in a manner that was far too quiet for someone in such an old house, leaving me by my lonesome. The curtains hung like carcass shrouds, the floors creaked with each momentary shift in weight, and the house groaned as if the building itself was alive.

In the dark, the appeal of the house's eerie nature had worn away, and the fear was seeping back in. Even pushing myself onto my feet released a cacophony of protesting squeaks that made me jump. Hoping that Eden was right about the place being soundproof, I tip-toed across the living room, making my way to the stairs. Just before I could reach the flight of steps, I caught sight of something in my peripherals. Perched on one of the many shelves was a small framed picture.

I peered closely, examining the photo. It was faded and yellow, nearly a century old. The frame was a black, elegant piece with a silver trim. The photo itself seemed to be a family photo, positioned outside the manor itself. Only, it was a lot cleaner, and the massive oak tree that clung to the structure like a parasite was missing. While I didn't recognize any of the faces, I did notice a man in the middle, older in age yet possessing a certain dominance that made it clear he was the patriarch.

He stood with his back straight and his arms crossed, his face set in a stern expression. What was most strange about his appearance a terrible scar that spanned across the left side of his face, skin peeled off to reveal his teeth and eye. A war hero? Or just the victim of some horrible accident?

The rest of the family looked just as grim—expressionless, almost mannequin-like. No one smiled. Not even the children. Something about their faces unsettled me in a way I couldn’t explain, and I decided it'd be best to return to my room and get a good night's rest. I needed to be well-rested for my classes in the morning.

As I ascended the rickety stairs, each creak sharper than the last, I found myself thinking back to something Eden had said—something that hadn’t struck me until now.

Hollow, she had called it. I was by no means an architect, but there was no way that a place of this size and age could be hollow, could it? That sounded like a structural nightmare. Surely it would have collapsed under its own weight with how little care was put into it. I stopped in front of my room, the hallway lit by the dim light of the moon that poured in through my window, and took a moment to examine the walls. They were old, sure, and there were cracks and holes in them, but the foundation seemed solid enough.

Curious, I pressed my hand against the wallpaper and pushed. It felt... Like a wall. Of course. As I chastised myself for being so paranoid, however, the wall gave out a little under my palm. A faint squelch could be heard, and I felt something warm secrete into my hand. I wrenched the limb back, my heart rattling. A thick, viscous fluid clung to my skin, sticky and dark in the low light.

Panic seized me, and I stumbled clumsily from room to room, trying to decipher which one was the bathroom. Once I found it, I slammed the door open and flipped the lights on, nearly blinded by the sudden brightness.

It wasn't water coating my hands, nor mud, nor anything else that could've made any semblance of sense.

It was blood.

1kv32l0,https://i.redd.it/dexkb6h6ox2f1.png,"[discussion] Finally got my FT OC designed! Meet the Desert Ghost, Anima—or Verene Windhall 👻","Spoilered for slightly nudity ^^ I've been working on developing this gal and her story for the better part of 7 years now (the number 7 sticks around haha), and I'm so glad I finally have her complete reference! Here's her bio if you'd like to know more about her—and yes, tis long. 

Some details and context are omitted, however. Want to keep some story elements a surprise for when I finally get around to writing out her story :>

———

Verene Windhall, or also known as the Desert Ghost, lived most of her life as a top operative under the Alvarez Empire, an assassin who unknowingly helped to rapidly expand the country's borders. She was convinced to enlist at a young age through her father who, although emotionally-distant, Verene had aimed to earn his pride from. 

Through her time in the military, she's taught what is now her signature magic, Spectre Soul, along with brutal conditioning to become the Empire's weapon—an assassin skilled in fast and precise close-combat, cold and isolated. And she almost loses herself completely in who she's ""supposed"" to be, until being forced to kill the one person she never wanted to hurt. She finds herself branded as a traitor to the Empire, forced to flee the country, eventually ending up in the continent of Ishgar. 

Scarred both physically and mentally, she wanders the country of Fiore, 100% in survival mode, now forced to see the world in a constant shade of blue—a permanent effect/reminder of what had haunted her. 

It isn't until a few weeks since she's stepped foot on the foreign soil, that she comes across a blind mask maker, the first one to greet her with kindness—and coffee. Not knowing how far the Empire's reach travels overseas, she introduces herself as Anima, hiding all semblance of who she was behind the new moniker. The man gifts her a mask—simple, yet somehow personalized—but not without parting with her the hopeful notion of her not needing the mask forever. He also parts with her, the direction of one Fairy Tail guild, of which he had once been a member of in years past. 

Seeing how she has nowhere else to go, she decides to try her luck with the guild, hoping to find a place where she can lay low and just work for the rest of her life. 

But little does she know, she would end up finding the home she never knew she needed. 

Anima joins in x790, during the series' 7-year time-skip. She's faced with a lot of resistance upon joining, especially from being a near-perfect fighter with no past or history known to them. But over the course of the show—from the Grand Magic Games up to the events of the war with Alvarez—bonds are made, love sparks, and maybe—just maybe—she can finally find a way to be at peace with herself. 

——— 

I'm more than open to answer any questions or thoughts on her character in general! I'm just really excited to finally share her with y'all :D

My partner and I are relocating to Toronto this September and planning a visit in July to get a feel for different neighbourhoods. We’re hoping to get some advice from locals about where we might want to live!

Our main two requirements are:
- Easy access to Union Station via public transit (that's where the office is).
- LGBTQ+ friendly; we want to feel safe and welcome in the community

Beyond that, we’d love to be close to some of the following if possible:
- Volunteering opportunities (especially at animal shelters, food pantries, or nature centres. He has experience volunteering with the Audubon Society running trail walks and touch tank aquariums)
- A decent-sized park for regular dog walks
- A local game store (we play a lot of Magic: The Gathering)
- A dart bar or shop (weirdly niche, we know, but he’s into darts! Its a big thing where we come from)
- A coffee shop with breakfast sandwiches (I am a slit for sausage egg and cheese in the morning)

If you have a favourite neighbourhood (or hidden gem) that fits some or all of these, we’d love to hear about it. 

Thanks so much in advance, we're looking forward to joining the Toronto community!

1kv2whg,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1kv2whg/few_mini_success_stories_as_i_was_heavily/,Few Mini Success Stories (as I was heavily doubting the law),"Hey Everyone,

*NOTE: To be honest, for last two weeks I was having a really hard time trusting the law, I was getting attached to 3d and feeling horrible about myself day by day. It was pretty rough. It was hard because I had a really good month of balance and successes (you can check my previous post). But yesterday, I sat down after a long shift and journaled and read my old diary entries from the weeks. All of this after an instant success yesterday.*

So, All the Law doubters during tough moments, this one's for you (and also Me :) )

Success Stories:

* Yesterday, I had a waitressing shift of about 8+ hours, I decided to do robotic affirmations (I was in no mood to feel it. I just wanted to chill and improve my self concept. So, I affirmed for I think half hour-one hour as I sliced bread that - *'I receive tips today. I am worthy of everything and anything I want. I am loved, I am appreciated and adored. I am lucky and abundant. Love, success, luck and abundance flows through me. Everything works for me*'...I looped this in my head mindlessly. Till date I never received tips and there's a lot of us because I work on a cruise and later, I forgot and just got busy for next 6 hours. By the time, shift ended I didn't receive tips from any client. it was okay because after a long week I was feeling good. But then while, I was leaving one of my colleague's who worked on the same floor called me and shared half of her tips (almost 10 euros) with me because she really liked my work??? She isn't my friend and we very rarely talk so it was totally unexpected. **Thing is I understood not receiving manifestation is possible and was okay with it but I didn't assume against getting it.** I didn't obsess over a table or who could give me tips or worked too much to look tip-worthy, really didnt do anything, also I was on my periods so if anything I was really mellow and less active haha. I literally forgot after some time of affirming and got it in the most unexpected way! So, yes it works even when you don't do anything or feel it!
* I started my blog around some months. I have hard time with numbers and believing I could build a readership because I have very few friends and only one or two of them are readers. But I affirmed at the beginning of the month that I will hit 75+ subscribers in this month and 1k by the end of the year. **I simply affirmed and believed and visualised it at the start of May, forget about it and just kept posting as much as I could.** I took a break last week because I was depressed and didn't check my blog at all. Yesterday, I logged on again and saw I have 65 now! Mind you, I started with 8 subscribers at the end of April. Tbh, like the tips one **I considered it not happening**  because algorthims are tricky and I prefer any social media in doses **but a small part of me believed despite everything. Again, i didn't affirm against it.** People love and appreciate my work and it makes me as happy as I felt when I visualised.
* I am currently looking for a permanent job in my country as my visa is ending. It's one of my main issue which stresses me a lot. I remember crying a lot for few days but last weekend I had a talk with my mother and she said, **It is hard but you don't need hundred acceptance just one and opportunity will walk to you, if you cannot reach it. I like this line and i repeated it and despite everything I believed in it.** I didn't receive anything yet but I started receiving several emails than before of opening now, my old university professor emailed an opening to me in another country but with visa offered. One of my uncle's friend asked for my CV as assured she would help me. Basically, things are turning in smaller ways. I am adamant of receiving my exact manifestation of the job in country I am in but all of these are synchronicities and back up options, it makes me believe universe does have my back. It helps me stay grateful and yes, Opportunities are reaching me like my affirmation.
* Apart from that, I made a post which I deleted later that is detachment a movement too? because I was searching for an answer while I was feeling detached to sp. It was confusing times. **But thing is I was repeating in my head, I need answers and I want to end this loop.** I have been stuck in this hot n cold phase since I started and this crashout was worst because after posting that I felt extremely depressed and just drained. I also developed acne and got sick. I went to my therapist and she said that she always tries to touch upon this but, **my root issue and underlying belief about myself is that I need something external to prove my worth.** *She told me that I will help you find your answers just trust yourself, we will get you out of this loop.*.. her exact words! so things are looking up?
* Some more robotic affirmations ones - **I didn't believe could happen but also didn't affirm against** were free coffee, a specific copy of a book out of print, immediate appointment to my gynaecologist and therapist which usually takes weeks, a subtle sp movement in the most unexpected place, tickets to a concert which was literally impossible to get in the moment in cheaper price.

I made this post, simply to point a pattern that most of us struggle with how and when and conclude why something cannot happen.

It is hard to believe in things and that it okay but we can surely practise to not make it unbelievable. I considered chances of why something looks impossible but I didn't dwell on them and rather affirmed and moved on. I didn't do much, checked, felt bad or gave up just lived and it happened.

And I know, it is easier for me to say that this is it but it truly is. Smaller wins builds trust and makes it easier and brings us closer to our attached desires by making us realize how inconsequential they truly are when we barely care. When we really not care is we signal to the world, i consider this happening and not but that still won't stop me from affirming and believing in myself.

I hope this post helps the way it helped me post crash out! haha",2,1748180694.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False

1kv2qcw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1kv2qcw/aita_for_calling_my_husband_emotionally_abusive/,AITA for calling my husband emotionally abusive when he questioned my whereabouts? Plot twist: he was paying off my loans while I was cheating,"Edit: [with all updates<-----](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB1P7J4eNmk&t=301s)

My marriage just collapsed in the most spectacular way possible and honestly, I'm sitting here at 2 AM wondering if I'm the villain in my own story.

My husband has been acting ""weird"" for the past six months. By weird, I mean he started asking where I was going when I left the house at night, wanted to know who I was texting when my phone buzzed constantly, and had this look on his face like he was trying to solve some impossible puzzle every time I walked in the room. At first I thought he was being paranoid or controlling, so I started throwing around terms I'd learned from therapy TikToks about emotional manipulation and questioning behavior.

""You're being emotionally abusive by interrogating me,"" I told him one night when he asked why I was going out again on a Tuesday. ""I'm an adult and I don't need to report my every movement to you.""

He just stared at me with this expression I couldn't read and said, ""Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.""

That should have been my first red flag, honestly. He never backed down that easily before.

So I kept going out. Tuesday nights became my thing. Sometimes Thursdays too. I told him I was meeting college friends, grabbing drinks with coworkers, attending book club meetings. The lies came so naturally I started believing them myself. Meanwhile, I was actually meeting up with this guy from my old job. We'd worked together for three years before I quit, and we'd always had this tension between us that never got resolved.

The whole thing started innocently enough. He reached out on social media asking how married life was treating me. We started texting, then meeting for coffee, then those coffees turned into dinners, and those dinners turned into hotel rooms. Classic affair progression that I somehow convinced myself wasn't really cheating because we were ""just talking"" and ""reconnecting as friends"" right up until we weren't.

My husband kept getting quieter and more distant. He'd come home from work looking exhausted, barely eat dinner, and spend most evenings on his laptop doing what I assumed was more work. When I'd ask what he was working on so late, he'd just say ""financial stuff"" and change the subject.

I started feeling guilty about the affair, but instead of ending it, I somehow twisted that guilt into resentment toward my husband. Why wasn't he fighting for our marriage? Why wasn't he trying harder to connect with me? Why did he seem so checked out? I used his emotional distance to justify continuing to see the other guy.

Three weeks ago, everything came crashing down.

My husband came home early from work and found me getting ready to go out. I was wearing this dress I'd bought specifically for my Tuesday night meetups, had done my hair and makeup in a way that definitely wasn't for book club.

""Where are you going?"" he asked, and there was something different in his voice. Not suspicious or angry, just tired. Defeated, maybe.

""Book club,"" I said automatically.

He nodded slowly, then walked over to his laptop and turned the screen toward me. ""Which book are you reading?""

On the screen was a bank statement. My student loan account. Balance: $0.00. Payment history showing monthly payments of $1,200 for the past eighteen months. All coming from an account I'd never seen before.

I felt my stomach drop straight through the floor.

""I've been working overtime every single day for a year and a half,"" he said quietly. ""Weekends too. I wanted to surprise you by paying off your loans early so we could start trying for kids without that debt hanging over us.""

I couldn't speak. Couldn't move. Couldn't process what I was seeing.

""I knew something was wrong when you started going out so much and getting defensive about it. I hired a private investigator three months ago."" He pulled out a manila folder from his desk drawer. ""I know about him. I know about the hotel. I know about all of it.""

My whole body went cold. ""Why didn't you say anything?""

""Because I kept hoping I was wrong. I kept thinking maybe if I just worked harder, paid off more debt, gave you more space, you'd remember why you married me."" His voice cracked. ""I've been killing myself at work to build our future while you've been building a relationship with someone else.""

I tried to explain, to justify, to make him understand that I felt neglected and lonely, but every word that came out of my mouth sounded pathetic even to me. How do you explain that you called someone emotionally abusive for caring about your whereabouts while they were secretly sacrificing everything to improve your life?

""The worst part,"" he continued, ""is that every time I asked where you were going, you made me feel like I was the problem. You convinced me I was being controlling and toxic for wanting to know why my wife was suddenly living a secret life.""

He filed for divorce the next day. Moved out the day after that. His family won't speak to me. My own family is horrified. My friends are split between supporting me and telling me I destroyed the best thing that ever happened to me.

The other guy? He ghosted me the second he found out my marriage was over. Apparently sneaking around was exciting, but actually being available was not.

So here I am, alone in a house I can't afford, with zero student loan debt I didn't even know was gone, wondering how I managed to frame basic concern from my spouse as emotional abuse while I was actively betraying him.

I keep reading articles about gaslighting and emotional manipulation, and I'm starting to wonder if I was the one doing it all along. Did I manipulate him into believing he was the problem when I was the one destroying our marriage? Or was I right to feel suffocated by his questions, even if my reasons for being secretive were wrong?

Everyone keeps telling me I should have just talked to him about feeling disconnected instead of having an affair, but in the moment it didn't feel that simple. It felt like he'd already checked out of our marriage emotionally, so why couldn't I check out too?

I’m 45, and wondering if I’m feeling the impact of two major lifestyle changes in my mid 30s, or if it’s just normal for getting older.  Docs have no good answers for me so far, and see nothing medically wrong.  Considering it’s not a medical issue/problem, figured I’d poll a general community.


**The two lifestyle changes:**

1) I didn’t drink water until 35, unless it was in the form of tea, that’s the closest I got to drinking just water since I was a kid.  At 35 I switched to only coffee and water intake, nothing else as a drink.

2) I learned to poop.  Prior to 35, I literally would poop once a week because it was such a struggle (prolly from extreme dehydration), so when things got backed up enough it HAD to come out, and that’s just how it worked since I could remember.

During my little research I discovered that the products are basically multivitamins that don’t have that much vitamins than those that you get from the store. In my opinion, I don’t think they are inherently bad but they’re a bit overpriced. A lot of customers who tried these products have experienced improvements but I don’t think it should be regarded as this miracle elixir.
I expressed my concern to her and she got really mad. She called me susceptible to propaganda and that I would “be easily indoctrinated into cults.” There were also some points that she made that got me curious.

The following are her arguments.
•If the company is so bad then how did it pass the doping test?
•How can you explain the side effects that people experience differently? [Some people have experienced certain body parts getting red or bodies breaking into hives]
•How are you going to explain the video of the supplements breaking down coffee? (She showed me videos of the activate and restoration powder breaking down instant coffee.)

Are there explanations to these phenomenons that she argued? And can you guys rebuttal against them?

**Season 2 Episode 2: Halloween Night (2024)**

**Jun-Ho** sneaks into the Pink Motel and starts investigating the fourth floor when suddenly he hears screaming coming from one of the rooms. He barges it open and sees **Woo-Seok** tied up and blindfolded. He unties **Woo-Seok** and checks if he's okay. However, **Woo-Seok** screams even louder and punches **Jun-Ho** in the face as he thinks **Jun-Ho** is working for **The Salesman**. **Jun-Ho** restrains a frightened **Woo-Seok** and clarifies that he just needs to know where **Gi-Hun** is. **Woo-Seok** is hesitant to answer but the silence is interrupted by a gunshot. **Woo-Seok** runs to **Gi-Hun's** room with **Jun-Ho** following to find out the cause of the gunshot. 

**Woo-Seok** and **Jun-Ho** barge into the room where they find **Gi-Hun** standing above **The Salesman's** dead body. **Woo-Seok** runs to hug **Gi-Hun** and thanks him for killing **The Salesman**. He tells **Gi-Hun** that he killed **Jeong-Rae** with teary eyes. **Woo-Seok** moves out of the way to kick his dead body, allowing **Gi-Hun** to see **Jun-Ho** behind him once he finishes processing **Jeong-Rae's** death. **Gi-Hun** is happy to see **Jun-Ho** return to his life but the latter is a bit scared seeing that he just killed **The Salesman**. **Gi-Hun** drops his gun and hugs **Jun-Ho**, to the latter's shock.

Later that night, a guard knocks on the door of a minivan belonging to **Kang** **No-Eul**, an employee at the nearby amusement park. He scolds her for sleeping here and tells her that she is not allowed to park here at this hour and that he would get in trouble if he doesn't report her. He lets her go this time but next time he would have to fine her.

Back in the Pink Motel, **Jun-Ho** catches the other two up on his experience as a guard in the 2020 Squid Games, and what he discovered such as the guards harvesting the still alive players for organs, **VIPs** being invited every year to watch the games, and the man behind the games who wore a black mask and ultimately shot him. He doesn't **Gi-Hun** about his brother as he doesn't trust him completely and will wait until he asks to announce so. **Woo-Seok** is still wary of **Jun-Ho** and doesn't believe his story as the police have never helped them and recommends against **Gi-Hun** telling **Jun-Ho** his experience. **Gi-Hun** interrupts the bickering by asking the both of them how many more people have to die for the sake of the games? He explains the reason the games work is because they are relying on the players to betray each other, that they thrive on hatred and deceiving. **Woo-Seok** sheds a tear for his fallen friend. **Jun-Ho** thinks back to his half-brother shooting him. The latter remembers the **Captain's** advice and turns the anger into finding justice. He searches **The Salesman's** body and finds a card that reads ""October 31, Midnight, Club HDH"".

**Gi-Hun** takes the two men into another room of the motel he turned into a gun range. **Gi-Hun** shows **Jun-Ho** and **Woo-Seok** his collection of guns, which cover the walls and fill the bathtub. Picking up a gun, **Jun-Ho** questions if they work. In response, **Gi-Hun** pulls back a curtain and walks through a knocked down wall, revealing a makeshift gun-range. At the end of the man-made hallway, is a wardrobe with the symbols of a circle, triangle and square. **Gi-Hun** rapidly shoots at the targets, alarming **Woo-Seok**. He offers the space as a practice room and suggests **Jun-Ho** quits his job.

**THE NEXT DAY**

At the amusement park the next morning, **No-Eul** works as an entertainer as part of the carnival. She wears a pink bunny costume, waving to children and handing out lollipops. **Park Na-Yeon**, one of the children in the crowd, is sad as she is skipped to receive a lollipop by the pig mascot. Upon seeing this, **No-Eul** hands her one instead. In their dressing room, the entertainers complain about working in the heat. **No-Eul** stares in the mirror, unsatisfied. **Na-Yeon** opens the door to the dressing room and the workers all hurry to replace their mascot heads. She walks up to **No-Eul** and hands her a crayon drawing of herself and **No-Eul** as the bunny. As **No-Eul** responds with a heart, **Na-Yeon** asks if she is hurt upon seeing her scars on her wrist, presumably from self-harm. The man in the pig costume walks in without his mascot head on and starts to swear and complain, causing **Na-Yeon** to cry. **Na-Yeon's** father, **Park Gyeong-Seok**, calls out for her and apologises for the intrusion. After they leave, the man in the pig costume explains that **Na-Yeon** is the daughter of **Gyeong-Seok**, an artist who draws people's portraits in the park, and that she has blood cancer and is in need of a bone marrow transplant.

In the afternoon, **Gi-Hun** pays his daily ""visit"" (or rather watching from afar), to **Sang-Woo's mother** and her adopted grandson, **Kang Cheol**, the younger brother of **Kang Sae-Byeok**, a player **Gi-Hun** befriended in the 2020 Squid Games but was killed right before the final game. He sees **Cheol** running home to hug his grandmother after school and smiles.

Afterwards, he visits **Sae-Byeok's** old broker to get her mother out of North Korea. The **broker** explains to **Gi-Hun** that **Sae-Byeok's** **mother** was recently released from a prison camp in North Hamgyong Province; she never received proper treatment for her tuberculosis and will be unable to move for a while. He urges him to get her here as soon as possible to which the broker assures him that as soon as she recovers, they will. **Gi-Hun** hands him a slip of paper with the fish store's phone number on it, explaining that is where **Cheol** is, and tells him to contact them if he cannot get ahold of **Gi-Hun** himself.

As **Gi-Hun** is on his way out, he accidentally bumps into **No-Eul**, and he makes her drop and spill her coffee. **Gi-Hun** apologizes and says that he will buy her a new one. **No-Eul** replies that it's a nice gesture but won't be necessary and walks away just as **Gi-Hun** is about to convince her otherwise.

**No-Eul** arrives at the **broker's** office who enquires about finding her child, as she rejects the notion that she is dead. The broker is annoyed at No-eul's insistence as there is little evidence she is alive. She hands him an envelope of money, urging him to look for her ""one last time"". He rejects **No-Eul's** money, empathetically suggesting she should forget about her daughter.

The setting shifts to **Jun-Ho's** house where he, **Mal-Soon**, and **Captain Park** are having dinner. **Jun-Ho** informs them of who he met last night. **Mal-Soon** is horrified and says that he shouldn't stay in touch with someone who turned into a monster. **Jun-Ho** tries to argue otherwise saying that he killed for a good cause but **Mal-Soon** cuts him off by saying killing is killing, although it's a sad thought, the games definitely turned that man into a monster. **Jun-Ho** looks to **Captain Park** for backup by telling him **Gi-Hun** would aid their cause to find the island but **Captain Park** looks confused saying that they aren't looking for an island. **Jun-Ho** looks confused out of his mind and turns to his mom but she already went to get the desert.

In her car outside, **No-Eul** stares at a picture of herself, her daughter and her husband and cries. She takes out a pill bottle, empties it and swallows all the pills. A man knocks on her window, however it is not the police officer from before. She rolls down her window and the man hands her a small invitation card with the familiar three symbols on it...

As **Captain Park** is about to leave **Jun-Ho** asks if he could talk to him. Obviously, he asks about why he lied about searching for the island but he brushes it off, explaining that he didn't want to worry his mother. **Jun-Ho** remembers that after all this time, he still hasn't told his mother about their conquest but ultimately agrees with **Captain Park** about not wanting to worry her.

**THE NEXT DAY**

**Na-Yeon**, back at the carnival, looks for **No-Eul**. However, as a different entertainer is in the bunny costume, they do not give **Na-Yeon** a lollipop and doesn't acknowledge her at all. She is visibly upset by this. **No-Eul** hands in her resignation, stating she is quitting for personal reasons, thanks her employer and leaves. An ambulance drives past **Gyeong-Seok** as he is drawing and realises it's for **Na-Yeon**. **Na-Yeon**, having fallen unconscious, is taken to the hospital with her father. **No-Eul** watches the ambulance drive off and picks up the strawberry hat **Na-Yeon** was wearing that she left behind.

**Jun-Ho** stands outside of the Pink Motel, debating whether or not he should continue to help **Gi-Hun**, but ultimately decides to as it is for saving lives, what he's always dreamed of doing since he was a kid.

In the hospital, the doctor tells **Gyeong-Seok** about a new medication that may be beneficial to **Na-Yeon** as a cancer patient, however it is not yet covered by insurance. **Gyeong-Seok** insists he will get the money somehow, urging him to help his daughter. **No-Eul** arrives and enters **Na-Yeon's** room - she is unconscious and under an oxygen mask. When **Gyeong-Seok** returns, **No-Eul** is gone, but **Na-Yeon's** strawberry hat is placed on her bed.

Inside the motel, **Woo-Seok** includes a whole bunch of men he's in touch with to join their rebellion against the Squid Games and brings them to the shooting range. The three men make a plan on how to sneak into the club. They will each have earpieces to communicate with each other and hear each other's surroundings, and trackers to let each other know where they are. If any of them encounter anything to do with the games, then they will have to alert the others or drop hints. They all get in the car to drive to the club, with the men **Woo-Seok** following for protection.

Meanwhile, **No-Eul** rings the number on the card she was given and confirms her participation, sat by a fire. As she is given the details of where she will be picked up, she burns the card, and looks at the drawing **Na-Yeon** gave to her. She hesitates for a moment before throwing a fit of rage and aggressively ripping the piece of paper and burning it.

**Gi-Hun**, **Jun-Ho**, and **Woo-Seok** all enter the club, through **Jun-Ho** threatening them with a gun. They all look for suspicious signs but are so far unsuccessful, until **Gi-Hun** sees a silhouette that resembles the **Front Man**, according to **Jun-Ho's** description. However, he sees that it's a guy dressed in a grim reaper costume. **Woo-Seok**, however, has better (or worse depending on how you look at it), luck and gets cornered by a guard. The guard tasers him, making him scream, alerting the other two. **Jun-Ho** turns back to follow the direction of **Woo-Seok's** screams but gets blocked by another guard also with a taser. This time however, **Jun-Ho** starts a fist fight with this guard, causing an eruption of the crowd chanting for them to fight. **Jun-Ho** manages to escape and find **Woo-Seok's** unconscious body and quickly runs back to the car to prevent anything worse to happen to him. The previous guard who tasered **Woo-Seok** unfortunately gets **Gi-Hun** as well and loads him into a limousine.

In the limo, the **Front Man** talks to **Gi-Hun** via a golden pig. He starts off by saying he isn't going to kill him, and tells him he'd hoped **Gi-Hun** would forget everything and live a happy life and reiterates that he should've gotten on the plane. **Gi-Hun** enjoins him to stop the games, but the **Front Man** dismisses him, saying that ""The games will not end unless the world changes"". **Gi-Hun** rejects this and criticises the **Front Man's** manipulative tactics of preying on vulnerable people. **Jun-Ho** orders the gunmen to stop the limo, however both of the vans tires get shot by a sniper. With both vans gone, he attempts to follow the limo himself but unbeknownst to him, there is a bomb strapped under his car, which explodes, causing the limo to get away. Hearing this commotion over his earpiece, **Gi-Hun** pulls out a gun and tells the **Front Man** to stop the car. He shoots but the divider between the driver and the passenger seats is bullet proof. The Front Man derides his naivety, and **Gi-Hun** commands to be put back in the game. The **Front Man** questions this, but **Gi-Hun** convinces him to agree by arguing the **VIPs** who watch will be thrilled to have a previous winner return. He instructs him to take him to the games to which the **Front Man** taunts him for ""playing the hero"". **Gi-Hun** replies ""I'll show you that the world doesn't always go the way you want it to."" The **Front Man** finally agrees and gas is released, knocking **Gi-Hun** out. The last thing he sees is the **Front Man's** black mask and him welcoming him back into the game. 

**No-Eul** drives to the meeting place, exits her car and enters a shipping container on a lorry, with others doing the same. She reaches her room marked ""011"" and takes her place inside. As she puts on her mask, it is revealed that she is entering the games as a pink guard, not a player.",2,1748179636.0,squidgame,0,1.0,False
1kv2iqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcirclejerk/comments/1kv2iqh/im_broke_because_of_dragon_smut/,I'm broke because of dragon smut.,"I wrote a 400,000-word coming-of-age epic sci-fi comedic tragedy (first of a trilogy, only took me 8 years) about an introverted IT guy who is definitely not a self-insert who realizes he's the chosen one destined to save every universe. Along the way, he meets a hot orc woman who's into him for some reason and has a talking gopher as a sidekick. Anyway, it's been a hard sell since I released it six months ago, and I've done everything possible to market it. 

I put up ads on the bulletin board at my local coffee shop, I spammed Reddit, I even printed out tiny little copies of the 3D book cover I got off Fiverr for $19, rolled them up, and attached them to an army of carrier pigeons. Unless I get approved for BookBub, I've *literally* done everything except for shit that doesn't work, like building a mailing list and sending ARCs because everyone knows those are scams.

I posted last week asking for critique, and some guy suggested it's because my blurb gives away the fact that everybody dies at the end, but I know that's bs because my cousin read it and said it's the best book he's ever read.

 I think it's time to talk about the elephant in the room, or rather, the dragon. One of the categories I shoved my book into is romantasy because it has dragons and there's a lot of prolonged eye contact, and I can't help but notice all the books in that category are complete trash. I haven't read any of them, but I can just tell, and I think it's unfair they have thousands of reviews while my magnum opus only has one three-star from my cousin Gary.

Long story short, dragon smut is ruining my life, and also art, and probably civilization in general, because all those people who bought *Mated to the Dragon Prince's Legion* would definitely have bought my book instead if it didn't exist. ",7,1748179620.0,writingcirclejerk,5,1.0,False

1kv2g7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kv2g7t/how_does_the_baby_trend_expedition_jogger_deliver/,How does the Baby Trend Expedition Jogger deliver performance? A detailed review!,"The **Baby Trend JG94F00D Expedition Jogger**, modeled in a sleek Dash Black, became my go-to stroller over the past month thanks to its promised comfort, utility, and safety. Its features like the all-terrain bicycle tires and lockable front swivel wheel immediately caught my attention. That being said, I had both delightful and challenging moments using it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Joggers are often recognizable by their sturdier build, and this one doesn’t fall short. The alloy steel frame paired with polyester elements provides a lightweight yet robust structure that feels reliable. The Dash Black finish is simple and chic—it didn’t feel out of place on city walks or at the park. Handling the rubberized ergonomic grip was comfortable even on longer outings. At 23.6 pounds, I initially thought maneuvering it might be cumbersome, but frankly, I was surprised at how seamlessly it navigated different terrains. Its compact folding mechanism became my savior for tight storage spaces.

**Ease of Maneuverability**  
The lockable front swivel wheel proved to be both a blessing and a slight drawback. For zig-zagging through crowded parks or shop aisles, the swiveling mechanism added instantaneous flexibility. However, locking the wheel for inline performance (like on jogging paths) provided reliable guidance on smoother surfaces. However, if the ground was uneven, the locked wheel felt slightly resistant, especially during quick turns. My sister tested this on bumpy trails and confirmed that while it fares okay, it’s optimized more for jogging paths or city environments.

**Child Comfort and Safety Features**  
Safety was clearly a priority in this stroller's design. The multi-position, reclining, padded seat offers a snug fit for babies of different sizes, and the 5-point harness secures the child while maintaining adjustability and flexibility. I appreciated the built-in tether strap, which adds one more layer of assurance. My toddler niece found the seat comfortable enough to nap during longer strolls—reclining truly helps! The covered sunroof and ratcheting adjustable canopy effectively blocked out sunlight and even protected her on windy days, although the visor could benefit from better angles for full shade during late afternoon walks.

**Storage Solutions**  
As a parent, adequate storage is vital, and the extra-large storage basket exceeded expectations. It easily accommodated diapers, a toy, and even my medium-sized backpack! The parent tray was another hit, featuring two cup holders and covered storage—ideal for my coffee and keys. I’d sometimes leave snacks in the covered compartment during walks, and it kept them safe from prying little hands. The child’s tray, which also had two cup holders, was equally useful for keeping drinks within reach and clean.

**Positives**  
Key advantages of this stroller stood out during frequent use:  
- The trigger folding system made it extremely easy to collapse and carry.  
- All-terrain tires ensured decent rides on varying paths.  
- Strong low-light visibility due to the thoughtful addition of footrest reflectors.  
- Useful compatibility with Baby Trend EZ-Lift infant car seats, converting it into a travel system.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While the jogger packs a punch, certain drawbacks were noticeable over time:  
- The wheels occasionally exhibited a slight squeak on gravel after prolonged use.  
- Though the swivel wheel is handy, the lock mechanism feels tricky to engage at times.  
- The stroller could benefit from added cushioning for the child’s tray as it appears overly rigid.  

**Product Contenders**  
Several competitors give this product a solid run for its money. The BOB Gear Revolution Flex jogging stroller, for instance, excels with its mountain bike-style suspension system, offering an even smoother ride on rugged terrains. However, it’s heavier and lacks the folding ease that the Expedition Jogger is known for. Graco’s FastAction Fold Jogger is another strong alternative, providing a comparative user experience but with slightly more versatile infant car seat compatibility. That said, the Baby Trend’s storage capacity puts it ahead in practicality for families needing more space.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
This jogger sits comfortably in a mid-range price bracket. Considering its unique mix of an adjustable canopy, generous storage, lightweight folding, and onboard safety features, it justifies the investment for families looking for quality without overspending. Products offering similar features often cost more, while budget models compromise areas like safety add-ons or flexibility. Finding something so well-rounded in terms of practicality felt refreshing among jogging strollers.

1kv2fes,https://www.reddit.com/r/SweetpeaOnStarz/comments/1kv2fes/mitolyn_reviews_and_complaints_usa_uk_an_honest/,MITOLYN Review'S and ComplaintS:~ (USA & UK) An Honest Customer Review!,"After a full year — 365 days — of using **MITOLYN**, I’m finally ready to share a long-term, no-fluff review. I know there’s a lot of hype around “mitochondrial health” supplements lately, and like many of you, I’ve tried my share of energy boosters, brain fog fixes, and nootropic stacks that didn’t deliver.

MITOLYN was different. Not instant, not flashy, but real. Over time, it helped me rebuild my energy, mental clarity, and even my emotional stability in a way that stuck.

If you're thinking about trying MITOLYN or just curious whether mitochondrial support actually works, here’s everything I experienced over the past year.

# What is MITOLYN?

**MITOLYN** is a daily supplement designed to support and enhance **mitochondrial function** — meaning it helps your cells produce more natural energy by optimizing how they generate ATP (the body’s cellular fuel). The goal is to restore energy from the inside out, rather than temporarily stimulate it like caffeine or sugar.

If you’ve dealt with persistent fatigue, brain fog, low motivation, or stress-related burnout, MITOLYN aims to help at the root level: your cell’s ability to function properly.

# What’s in MITOLYN?

The formula caught my eye right away. MITOLYN contains clinically backed ingredients with real science behind them:

* **CoQ10** – Supports ATP production and protects mitochondria from damage.
* **PQQ** – Stimulates the creation of new mitochondria.
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Helps with mental sharpness, fat metabolism, and energy.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – An antioxidant that improves mitochondrial efficiency.
* **NAD+ Precursors** – For mitochondrial repair and anti-aging benefits.
* **B-Complex, Magnesium, and Rhodiola Rosea** – To support energy metabolism and reduce stress.

The formulation is clean — no caffeine, no fillers, no synthetic junk. Just a thoughtful combination of compounds that help your body generate sustained, healthy energy over time.

# My Experience Using MITOLYN for 12 Months

I started MITOLYN while feeling completely drained, both mentally and physically. Burnout was hitting hard, and nothing else seemed to help long-term. Here’s what the last 12 months looked like.

# Months 1–2: Subtle Shifts

* Energy was still low, but I noticed less morning grogginess after a couple of weeks.
* My afternoon crashes started fading — I wasn’t reaching for extra coffee or sugar.
* My mental clarity began improving slowly but noticeably.

# Months 3–4: Consistency Pays Off

* Energy throughout the day was more stable.
* Brain fog almost entirely disappeared.
* I felt more productive and found it easier to focus for longer periods.

# Months 5–6: Mental and Physical Improvements

* Workouts felt easier. I started walking more, lifting again, and recovering faster.
* My mood improved — I was more emotionally balanced and less reactive to stress.
* Sleep became more restful and consistent.

# Months 7–9: Peak Benefits

* Clear-headed from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed.
* More motivated, focused, and creative at work.
* I was able to take on more without feeling drained or overwhelmed.

# Months 10–12: Long-Term Resilience

* I felt more mentally sharp, physically active, and emotionally grounded.
* Fewer colds, quicker recovery, and a noticeable improvement in overall health.
* My energy levels today feel better than they did in my twenties (I’m 37 now).

# What I Liked About MITOLYN

* **No crashes, no stimulation** – The energy feels natural and sustainable.
* **Better mental clarity** – It’s easier to focus, plan, and stay motivated.
* **Emotional stability** – I feel calmer and more in control under pressure.
* **Great formulation** – No garbage ingredients or hype-based marketing.
* **Long-term effectiveness** – It gets better the longer you take it.

# What Could Be Improved

* The price is on the higher end, but the value has been worth it for me.
* It requires consistency — results build over time, not overnight.
* Only available online at the moment, which isn’t ideal for everyone.

# Final Verdict After 365 Days

MITOLYN delivered what it promised: long-term improvements in energy, mental performance, and mood. It’s not a quick fix, but rather a foundational tool for rebuilding vitality from the inside out.

After 12 months, I feel like I’ve upgraded how my body and brain operate. No dramatic transformations — just steady, meaningful progress. I’m more productive, better rested, and mentally sharper than I’ve been in years.

If you're looking for something to truly support your health and energy at the cellular level — not just mask symptoms — I highly recommend giving MITOLYN a 3- to 6-month trial. For me, it’s become a permanent part of my wellness routine.",0,1748179355.0,SweetpeaOnStarz,2,0.5,False
1kv2ebv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1kv2ebv/moved_island_kid_and_husband_stuck/,"Moved island, kid and husband stuck.","Hi all!

Just a quick conundrum I’m in, and I hope someone can help me.

I got a new switch, as my husband and kid wrecked my old one (joy con drift, worn out toggles down to the hard plastic, loose joycons, etc).

I transferred my island to my new system, but now my husband and kid are stuck on my island. Kid has a house, husband has a tent (his choice. I gave him the bells for a house lol).
They do NOT and WILL NOT have access to this switch- they can have the one they damaged and agreed to it, because ultimately, it is mine. (The only gift my husband has ever bought for me himself, and he agrees it’s still mine whether I use it or not.)

Here my question- 
can I start a new island on the old system, and move my kid back to it? Or will it not let him move back until I reach a certain point? I haven’t even tried yet,
I’ll admit. I just don’t want to give myself an anxiety attack like I did last night during the transfer😂

If I ‘restart’ on the old system, and make myself the IR, can I just move kiddo anytime?

So that begs another question- how do I get rid of my husbands tent?

I am almost 30 and my parents are in their late 50s. We live in different countries and I moved long time ago because our family has always been dysfunctional. My mother’s first husband has been killed in the war while my mother was 26 and my sister 2 years old. Years later, my mom met my dad, and they had me. Their relationship was never healthy, lots of jealousy, fights violence, etc.  They both suffer from extreme PTSD as my dad also spent his youth in war. My mother has been on different antidepressants/ medication for over 30 years. She also never worked and spends all her time just watching tv or scrolling her phone for hours . My dad still works really hard and long hours, and I know very well he’s not a great husband. However, in the past 2-3 years, she started showing more antisocial behaviour and went from jealousy to obsessiveness and paranoia. she accused my dad of having an affair with 7-10 women (again, don’t know if this is true or not), but it’s getting worse each time. It started of by controlling his phone, car mileage, following him, and escalated to her getting a criminal charge for verbal abuse of a woman that my dad knows through work. My mom bought 2-3 different phones and 4-5 SIM cards and constantly called her. Police received the report and found out that all those numbers go back to my mom. She accused the police detective that they have been bribed by the victim and that she (my mom) is being threatened by the woman’s  “evil” family. There’s probably been more women she might or might not have contacted, but also so many accusations saying there’s proof (that no one has seen). In the meantime she’s been stealing money of my dad, I caught her hiding things and lying, saying she’d hurt herself, many nervous breakdown that I witnessed that would just come out of nowhere, and she has been violent to my dad, my sister and me many times through the years. Again, the entire family has violent tendencies: her dad has been hitting their mom and them, and eventually beaten her up in a very old age during an aggressive demented episode. What happened latest is that she while she wants to file a divorce and kick my dad out of the house, she also wants to take half of all of his assets, and is working with a lawyer that she’s been paying for by an hour and that seems to be texting and “advising” her a lot on WhatsApp. She is saying to everyone that my dad is a narcissist, a monster that changes when they are together, and that it’s his fault that she’s the way she is. She’s been filming them fighting and has sent me videos in which she basically just yells at him, and has been asking for video footage of a local coffee shop they come to so that she can have proof of my dads “changing behaviour” when he approaches her. It’s so dark right now that it’s not even possible to detangle it.

She doesn’t want to admit she needs help, my dad has been depressed and has drastically aged and I’m terrified she might hurt herself or him. She threatened about taking her life many times before. What tipped me over now is that she hit him very bad a few days ago. Every time I try she refuses help, and accuses me of not believing her, sends incoherent messages and talks about herself in third person, a lot. 

Finally, what should I do? Any similar experiences or medical/legal advice? TIA. ",1,1748179104.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

You *do* have to enter a code at checkout to get it—it’s not automatically applied—and there are a few rules about which cabins and sailings qualify. But overall, it’s a legit savings and a solid way to bring down the fare a bit.

My question is which brand of tea leaves has a nice beautiful aroma and taste that suits this method? Bear in mind that after I brew, it only gets a dash of milk and a little sugar added.

I've tried Wagh Bakri recently, and while it was good, I felt that would be more suited to the stovetop method with milk that gets a chance to boil too.

I just opened a pack of Tata Gold Tea leaves. Its nice, but not there yet.

Some of the best tea I've had at home has been Red Label. But as with most teas, I've got varying flavour from batch to batch. I'm also surprised to learn recently that they add a rose flavour to it. I can't discern that flavour in the chai for what its worth...as I generally hate the taste of any flavours added to my tea or coffee.

I've only tried out these 3 brands, so really looking forward to experiencing something else.

Lastly, I can describe what I'm looking forward with this: You know when you open a new bag of tea leaves and get hit by a superb rich aroma? 
And then brew the tea just right so that it's not gone too bitter, yet while sipping it, you can taste and smell that same aroma?
That's it :)

1kv2735,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kv2735/2_years_with_my_budget_setup_time_to_upgrade_no/,2 Years with My Budget Setup - time to upgrade [no budget],"I’ve been running a budget setup for nearly two years now — a refurbished Sage Bambino paired with a Eureka Mignon Filtro (""modded"" with espresso burrs). It was a solid entry point when I was a student: compact, quick, and did the job.

But now that I’m graduated, working full-time, and doing well financially (no kids, and my partner’s also doing great), I’m ready to invest in something better. Budget isn’t really a constraint, though I’d still prefer to stay reasonable — no need to hit the very top of the market for the moment, I suppose.

My main issue: all my espressos taste… more or less the same. I’ve tried everything — grind settings, water recipes, ratios, pre-infusion tweaks. I’ve got access to loads of fresh coffee (a close friend is a roaster), but still, every shot ends up with that same flat, muted profile, if I compare them with the shots I drink at some good coffee shops. I’m guessing it’s the gear — the Bambino’s temp and pressure limitations, no solenoid 3 way valve, and maybe the grinder too. What I’m looking for now is: 1) more consistency shot to shot 2) a quieter equipment 3) setup that really lets different beans shine (light roast for example)c

I’ve started looking around, but I’m not sure what to prioritize. For example:

* **Rotary pump machines** look appealing for pressure stability and low noise, but they’re pricey. Worth it?
* **Classic Italian E61 machines** are beautiful and capable, but the long heat-up time — is that a daily pain?
* Should I consider **manual lever machines** like the Flair or La Pavoni for the control and simplicity (and silence)?

Btw, I've heard about the fellow espresso serie 1... Maybe it's the answer ?

  
Would love to hear your thoughts. What made the biggest difference in your upgrade journey? Where should I start?

Thanks in advance!

I’ve been using HepatoBurn daily for the last 6 months, and I want to give you a real, no-BS look at what happened — the good, the great, and anything in between.



If you're someone who’s been struggling with stubborn belly fat, slow metabolism, or just feel “off” due to a sluggish liver or aging metabolism, this might be the post for you.



Why I Tried HepatoBurn in the First Place

Like many people, I hit my 40s and noticed some frustrating changes:



Extra weight around the belly that wouldn’t budge, no matter how clean I ate



Slower metabolism and energy crashes during the day



Brain fog and a general lack of motivation



A feeling like my body was “clogged” or out of sync



I’ve always been skeptical of fat burners because most rely on stimulants and caffeine, which just make me jittery and don’t help long-term. But HepatoBurn caught my eye because it focuses on a different mechanism — supporting your liver.



Turns out, your liver plays a massive role in metabolism, hormone balance, and fat storage, especially around the midsection. So when I saw that HepatoBurn was made to reignite your body’s fat-burning by supporting liver function, I decided to try it — and I’m really glad I did.



What Is HepatoBurn?

HepatoBurn is a natural supplement that supports the liver, specifically targeting a liver-brain-fat axis that regulates fat burning, digestion, and energy.



According to the research behind it, many people (especially over 35) have a sluggish liver that can’t process fat and toxins effectively. This leads to:



Slow metabolism



Stubborn belly fat



Low energy and fatigue



Hormonal imbalances that cause weight gain



HepatoBurn is designed to reactivate your fat-burning metabolism by optimizing liver function with natural, research-backed ingredients.



HepatoBurn Ingredients – What’s Inside?

This is one of the reasons I felt safe trying it — the formula is clean, natural, and well-dosed.



Key ingredients include:



Cynomorium Songaricum Extract – a rare herb that supports liver detox and metabolism (used in traditional medicine for centuries)



Cistanche Deserticola – promotes fat-burning and energy by improving liver efficiency



Alpha-GPC – boosts brain-to-liver communication and helps regulate metabolic functions



Turmeric Root Extract – known for its anti-inflammatory and liver-cleansing effects



Milk Thistle – supports liver regeneration and detox



Schisandra Berry – a powerful adaptogen that protects liver cells and enhances fat breakdown



There are no stimulants, no caffeine, no synthetic fillers, and it’s GMP-certified and made in the USA. Plus, it's non-GMO and gluten-free.



My Month-by-Month Experience with HepatoBurn

Month 1: Subtle but Promising

Within the first week, I noticed less bloating after meals



My digestion felt smoother, and I had less brain fog



By week 3, I felt like I had a bit more energy throughout the day, even without coffee



No major fat loss yet, but my appetite seemed more balanced



Month 2: Real Changes Start

Woke up with flatter stomach most mornings



I had lost 4 pounds, mostly around the waist



I felt like my body was processing food more efficiently



Energy levels were steady all day without crashes



This was the month I really started to believe in the product.



Month 3–4: Metabolism Shift Kicks In

Lost 8 more pounds, mostly without changing my routine



Waistline shrank noticeably — even friends commented



I started sleeping better, which improved my mood and recovery



Digestion felt “clean” — less sluggishness and bloating



At this point, I added light workouts (walking + yoga), and results picked up even more.



Month 5–6: Sustainable Results

I’ve now lost a total of 15 pounds, mostly from the midsection



No rebound weight gain like I’ve experienced with other fat burners



My liver function (according to recent blood work) is better than before



I feel lighter, sharper, and more energetic overall



Best part? I didn’t need to follow a crazy diet — just clean eating and consistency



What I Love About HepatoBurn

✅ Focuses on the root cause — liver function and metabolism

✅ Non-stimulant formula — no jitters, no crashes

✅ Easy to take — just 2 capsules daily

✅ Real fat-burning results, especially targeting belly fat

✅ Helps with energy, focus, digestion, and even sleep

✅ Works even if you’re over 35 and feel like your metabolism has slowed

✅ Safe, natural ingredients backed by research



This isn’t a crash diet pill — it’s a metabolic support tool that helps your body work better, so fat loss becomes easier and more natural.



Any Downsides?

To keep things balanced, here are a few things you should know:



It’s not instant — results build over weeks, not days



You need to be consistent (I take it every morning before breakfast)



It’s only available online from the official website



The price is fair for what you get, but not cheap — though I saved with a multi-bottle deal



Honestly, these are small trade-offs for what you’re getting in return.



What Other HepatoBurn Reviews Are Saying

After doing more digging in health forums and Reddit, I found that many users report similar experiences:



“My belly fat melted off after 8 weeks. Nothing else worked before this.”



“HepatoBurn helped with my digestion and gave me steady energy.”



“Love that it doesn’t have caffeine. I feel healthy instead of wired.”



“My liver enzymes actually improved in my bloodwork.”



“Great supplement for anyone over 40 trying to reset their metabolism.”



That’s what convinced me to stick with it for the full 6 months.



Who Should Try HepatoBurn?

This supplement is ideal for you if:



You’ve tried fat burners but hate the jitters and side effects



You’re over 35 and feel your metabolism is slowing



You struggle with belly fat that won’t go away



You want to detox and support your liver while burning fat



You prefer natural ingredients and long-term health benefits



Final Verdict – Does HepatoBurn Really Work?

After using HepatoBurn for 6 months, I can confidently say:



✅ Yes — it works, and it works well

✅ It’s not a quick fix, but a sustainable fat-burning tool

✅ It gave me more energy, clearer digestion, and a flatter belly

✅ Best of all — it helped me reset my metabolism naturally, without crazy diets or stimulants

I’ll be petting him, then I get a smack.  Like, dude, I am petting you!

Am I not moving fast enough for his lordship?  Am I not petting in his preferred spot?  

After his breakfast (human grade chicken and veggies), I ran out for a coffee, and a bagel with cream cheese.  After eating my slotted half of the bagel, and sharing the other half with his lordship, he comes in for the Aussie hug.  Honestly one of my favorite things about this breed.  After the hug, he tries to get into my lap for pets.  While petting him, I get smacked.

His big ass is 85 pounds, and he thinks he’s a lap dog.  I think he gets offended when I sometimes have to push him off so I can breathe.  

Can anyone tell me why he continues to demand pets, when he’s already being pet?

Kia ora, A familiar story for many of you, but I recently got diagnosed with central sleep apnea from an at-home sleep test and have been told I likely have narcolepsy, but will need a clinical polygraph with MSLT before I can be provided any further treatment. I've been waiting for testing for 5 months, and will be getting tested on July 3rd.  I've had issues with my sleep for a while, but in the past year, it's got progressively worse, leading me to quit my job because of sleep attacks and poor performance. 

While I'm waiting for treatment, I need some advice on staying productive over the next month. I have non-negotiable commitments that must be completed before September, when I migrate overseas to pursue a postgraduate degree. 

**Here is how I'm currently managing my health** 

* 70mg Vyanse \[given for adhd, saw improvement with narcolepsy symptom, but still half-glass full and sleep debt has caught up now\] Sertaline 100mg \[for managing mood\] 
* CPAP machine \[1 week in, however, I have seen some improvement, such as no chronic headaches and sinus pain anymore, less sleep inertia, less breathlessness and that hungover feeling.\] 
* pretty 'healthy' all-round diet, and I run every second day. 

**These are some of the Narcoleptic dilemmas I'm struggling with**

1. How do I get up in the morning? Should I set an alarm at all if I'm going to ignore it? Or should I focus on creating some consistency with regular going to sleep and waking times? 
2. What should I do when I wake up at night? I usually wake up around 3-6 hours after falling asleep, and returning to sleep seems impossible. Should I get up and start my day from when I wake up, or should I stay in bed until my alarm goes off? If I haven't slept a full 7-9 hours, should I try to catch up on sleep later in the day, or should I focus on staying awake until my next bedtime? 
3. I microsleep and do automatic behaviour nearly all the time, but my major sleep attacks often occur once or twice a day between 1 and 8 p.m. I'm unsure how to tackle them, whether to embrace them or struggle against them. I've built up so much sleep debt that what was once only a half-hour nap is now 2-4 hours. I've tried power napping, but it's 50/50 if I don't clock out. I've also tried exercises before an attack comes on; however, in between getting changed and ready to run, the sleep attack catches up. 
4. A serious issue is that my ability to focus, memory and cognitive abilities are limited these days. On average, I'm at 30% of my old life; There are a few hours a day where I'm at least doing relatively better; however, I'm never sure how to prioritise those hours.
5. Caffeine, another one. Should I be messing with the stuff? I've been a coffee drinker since forever, and recently, I've been mixing it up with matcha in the morning and espresso in the afternoon. I found the results are often mixed. Caffeine improves my alertness until the drink is finished. 
6. Also, melatonin and sleep sedatives, yes or no? I've been giving a few over the years, but there has only been used for one off crisis of severe sleep deprivation, and I still have most of the packet left.

  
**Here's my current daily schedule for managing commitments and narcolepsy.** 

*\[Although only 10% of the time this routine goes exactly to plan.\]* 

**6:45-8:30:** wake up, breakfast & get out 

**8:30 - 9:30:** matcha + reading

**9:30 - 12 pm:** admin and work

**12:30 - 1:45:** lunch + coffee & walk

**1:45 - 2pm:** 15 min nap

**2 - 5:45:** admin and work

**5:45 - 6 pm:** 15 min nap

**6- 7:** run and eat dinner

**7 - 9:** low lit environment + night filter on electronics

**9 - 9:30:** hygiene + Setup CPAP + reading + stretches

1kv20ht,https://youtu.be/zXdiy8Vtkko,3 Very Scary TRUE Remote Truck Stops Horror Stories,"**""Midnight at Joe’s"":**

I’ve been working the night shift at Joe’s Truck Stop off I-70 in Kansas for five years, maybe longer. It’s a small place, stuck in the middle of nowhere, just a diner with chipped Formica tables, a couple of red vinyl booths, and a counter lined with stools that creak when you sit. The fluorescent lights buzz constantly, casting a pale glow over the linoleum floor, worn from years of truckers’ boots. Outside, the parking lot is a wide, gravel-strewn expanse, big enough for a dozen rigs, though most nights it’s just one or two, their engines silent, drivers asleep in their cabs. The hum of the drink coolers and the faint clatter of dishes in the back are all I hear after midnight. It’s a lonely spot, the kind where the world feels far away, and you’re left with your thoughts and the occasional stranger passing through. I thought I’d seen it all—drunk truckers, lost travelers, kids looking for trouble. But I was wrong.It was around 2 AM when the bell above the door jingled, sharp and sudden in the quiet. I was behind the counter, wiping down the coffee machine, the rag damp in my hand. A young woman walked in, maybe twenty-five, pregnant, her belly round under a loose gray sweatshirt. She wore a puffy jacket, too big for her, the sleeves hanging past her wrists. Her blonde hair was pulled back in a messy ponytail, strands sticking to her flushed cheeks. She carried a small purse, clutching it like it was all she had. Her eyes darted around the diner, scanning the empty booths, the dark windows, like she was expecting someone to jump out.“Hey,” I said, setting the rag down. “Can I help you?”She flinched at my voice, then looked at me, her eyes wide and nervous. “Is the payphone working?” she asked, her voice soft but shaky, like she was trying to keep it together.“Yeah, it’s good,” I said, pointing to the corner where the old phone hung on the wall, its cord tangled from years of use. “You okay?”She nodded quickly, but her hands trembled as she fumbled with her purse, digging for coins. “I just need to make a call,” she said, avoiding my eyes. She walked to the phone, her sneakers squeaking on the floor, and I noticed her glance back at the door, like she was checking to see if someone followed her. My stomach twisted. Something wasn’t right.I went back to cleaning, but I kept watching her from the corner of my eye. The diner was empty except for us, the only sound the faint hum of the coolers and the clink of her coins dropping into the phone. She dialed a number, her fingers moving fast, and pressed the receiver to her ear. “Jake? It’s me,” she said, her voice low but urgent. “I’m at the truck stop. Yeah, I’m okay, but… there’s this truck that’s been driving around the lot. It’s been circling for a while. It’s making me nervous.”I stopped wiping the counter, my hand frozen. The lot was dark, lit only by a couple of weak streetlights that barely reached the edges. I hadn’t noticed any truck moving out there, but the way she said it, her voice tight, made my skin prickle. I stepped closer to the window, peering out. The lot was still, just two rigs parked way out by the fuel pumps, their chrome glinting faintly. Nothing else. No movement, no headlights.She kept talking, her voice getting faster, higher. “No, it’s dark, maybe black or blue. I can’t tell. It’s got no plates, Jake. It’s weird. It keeps slowing down near the phone booth outside.” She paused, listening, her fingers twisting the phone cord so tight it looked like it might snap. “I don’t know, I just… I didn’t want to stay out there. I’m inside now, but I can still see it.”I moved closer to her, keeping my voice calm. “Hey, you want me to check the lot? Make sure everything’s okay?”She glanced at me, her eyes wide, and shook her head. “No, no, I’m fine. Just… stay here, okay?” She turned back to the phone, her voice dropping to a whisper. “Jake, stay on the line. I’m scared. What if it’s not just some guy?”My heart started pounding. I walked to the window again, pressing my face close to the glass. The lot was still empty, but now I was looking harder, squinting into the shadows. Was that a shape moving out there? A flicker of light? I couldn’t tell. The hairs on my neck stood up, and I felt that itch, like someone was watching. I turned back to her, about to say something, when she gasped into the phone.“Oh God, Jake, it’s stopping. The driver is getting out. He has a flashlight. I think he’s looking for me.” Her voice broke, and she pressed herself against the wall, her free hand clutching her belly. The phone cord stretched taut as she slid down slightly, her eyes locked on the window.I grabbed the baseball bat from under the counter, my hands sweaty on the worn grip. We kept it there for trouble—drunks, mostly—but I’d never had to use it. “Stay there,” I told her, my voice sharper than I meant. I moved toward the door, bat in hand, and looked out. Nothing. Just darkness and the faint hum of the highway in the distance. But my pulse was racing, and I couldn’t shake the feeling something was coming.The bell jangled again, loud and violent, as the door slammed open. A man stepped inside, tall, over six feet, broad shoulders filling out a heavy jacket. His cap was pulled low, shadowing his face, but his eyes caught the light—cold, empty, like they didn’t belong to a person. He didn’t look at me. His gaze locked on the woman, and she let out a small, choked scream, the phone slipping from her hand. It swung on its cord, Jake’s voice faint and frantic, calling her name.“Hey!” I shouted, stepping forward, bat raised. “What’s going on? Back off!”The man didn’t answer. He moved fast, crossing the diner in long strides, his boots heavy on the floor. The woman scrambled back, her purse falling, coins and a tube of lipstick scattering across the linoleum. “No, please!” she cried, her hands flailing as he grabbed her arm. She yanked against him, her nails scratching at his sleeve, but he was too strong.“Let her go!” I yelled, my voice shaking. I swung the bat, aiming for his shoulder, but he turned, quick as a snake, and the bat grazed his arm. He didn’t even flinch. His free hand pulled a knife from his jacket, the blade short but sharp, glinting under the lights. My stomach dropped.“Stay out of this,” he said, his voice low, calm, like he was talking about the price of gas. His eyes met mine, and I froze. There was nothing in them—no anger, no fear, just cold purpose.The woman was sobbing now, her legs kicking as he dragged her toward the door. “Please, I’m pregnant!” she screamed, her hands clawing at his arm, leaving red marks. “Let me go! Someone help!” Her eyes met mine, wide and desperate, begging for something I didn’t know how to give.I lunged again, swinging the bat, but he was ready. He shoved her against the wall, pinning her with one arm, and turned the knife on me. I tried to dodge, but the bat slipped, the handle smacking my temple. Pain exploded, white-hot, and I stumbled, grabbing the counter to keep from falling. The room spun, blood trickling down my cheek, warm and sticky.I heard her scream again, shrill and terrified, as he yanked her outside. The door slammed shut, the bell jangling like a mockery. I forced myself up, head pounding, and staggered to the window. In the lot, a black truck was parked near the payphone, no plates, just like she’d said. Its headlights were off, but I could see her silhouette, thrashing as he shoved her into the passenger side. Her hands banged against the window, a muffled cry cutting through the glass.I ran outside, the bat still in my hand, yelling, “Stop! Let her go!” The gravel crunched under my shoes, my breath coming in gasps. The truck’s engine roared, deep and guttural, and it peeled out, tires spitting rocks. I sprinted after it, my legs burning, but the taillights were already fading, swallowed by the dark. Her screams lingered in the air, then went silent.I stood there, chest heaving, the bat hanging useless at my side. My head throbbed, blood dripping onto my shirt. The lot was empty again, just the two rigs and the faint glow of the diner behind me. I stumbled back inside, my hands shaking as I grabbed the phone, Jake’s voice still there, shouting, “Hello? Hello? What’s happening?” I hung it up and dialed 911.“Someone’s been taken!” I said, my voice hoarse. “A woman, pregnant, at Joe’s Truck Stop on I-70. A guy with a knife, black truck, no plates. He took her. Hurry!”The cops arrived twenty minutes later, their lights flashing across the lot, red and blue cutting through the dark. I told them everything—her nervous walk in, the call to Jake, the truck circling, the man’s cold eyes, the knife. I showed them the coins and lipstick on the floor, her purse still open where it fell. They searched the lot, the payphone, the road, but found nothing. No tire tracks, no witnesses, no cameras that caught anything useful. The rigs’ drivers hadn’t seen a thing, asleep in their cabs.Jake showed up an hour later, his face pale, eyes red. He’d heard it all over the phone—her fear, her screams, the man’s voice. He kept asking me, “Why didn’t you stop him? Why didn’t you do more?” I didn’t have an answer. I just stood there, my head bandaged by the paramedics, feeling like I’d failed her.The cops said they’d look into it, check other truck stops, run descriptions of the man and the truck. But I could see it in their faces—they didn’t expect to find her. Truck stops like this are ghosts’ playgrounds, they said. People pass through, and some just disappear. Too many roads, too many shadows.I still work the night shift. I can’t quit, though I don’t know why. The diner feels different now, heavier. The bell jingles, and my heart stops every time. I keep the bat closer, check the lot every hour, my eyes scanning for that black truck. I see her face sometimes, in the quiet moments, her eyes pleading as he dragged her away. I wonder if I could’ve been faster, swung harder, done something—anything—to change it.The cops never found her. No truck, no man, no trace. Jake calls sometimes, asking if I’ve heard anything, but I haven’t. The purse is still in the lost-and-found, untouched, her lipstick inside like a reminder. At night, when the lot’s empty and the coolers hum, I stare out the window, waiting for those taillights to come back. They never do, but I can’t shake the feeling he’s still out there, somewhere, watching, waiting for the next one.

  


**""The Last Stop"":**

I’d been driving for hours, hauling a load of furniture from Ohio to New York. My shoulders were stiff, my eyes burning from staring at the endless road. It was late, probably around 1 a.m., when I pulled into a small truck stop in Sugar Grove, Pennsylvania. The place was tucked off a quiet highway, surrounded by dark fields and a few scattered trees. The lot had maybe five other rigs, parked far apart, their engines off, making the silence feel heavy. A single streetlamp buzzed overhead, casting a weak yellow glow over the fuel pumps and a small diner with grimy windows. I chose a spot at the far end of the lot, where the light barely reached, figuring it’d be quieter for sleep.As I cut the engine, I noticed a woman standing near the edge of the lot, leaning against a rusted signpost. She was thin, her jacket too tight, her jeans faded, and her arms crossed like she was trying to keep warm. Her hair was pulled back, but strands fell loose around her face. I’d seen women like her before at truck stops—lot lizards, working the lots for cash. She caught my eye through the windshield, her gaze steady, almost searching. I looked away, busying myself with my logbook, hoping she’d move on.“Hey, driver,” she called out, her voice cutting through the quiet. Her boots crunched on the gravel as she walked toward my truck, stopping a few feet from my door. “You looking for some company tonight? Help you unwind?”I rolled down my window just enough to answer, keeping my voice polite but firm. “No, thanks. Just here to rest up before I hit the road again.”She tilted her head, giving a small smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Long haul, huh? Well, if you change your mind, I’ll be around.” She paused, then added, “Watch yourself out here, okay? Not everyone’s friendly.” Her words hung in the air, and before I could respond, she turned and walked back toward the diner, her figure fading into the shadows. Something about her tone—the way she said watch yourself—made my skin prickle, like she knew something I didn’t.I locked my doors, double-checked them, and pulled out a ham sandwich from my cooler. The cab was my home on the road, cluttered with coffee cups, a folded blanket, and a radio that barely picked up stations out here. I ate slowly, trying to shake the unease. The lot was too quiet, the kind of quiet that makes every little sound feel big. A truck door slammed somewhere across the lot, and I flinched, peering through the windshield. Nothing. Just shadows and the faint glow of the diner’s neon sign.I climbed into the sleeper cab, pulling the heavy curtains closed to block out the world. Lying on the narrow mattress, I listened to the faint hum of a rig idling nearby, the occasional clink of metal from the fuel pumps. My mind kept replaying the woman’s words, and I wondered what she meant. I told myself I was just tired, overthinking it. Sleep came slowly, but it came.A loud bang jolted me awake. It was sharp, heavy, like something big hitting the ground right outside my truck. My heart raced, and I sat up, my blanket sliding to the floor. The cab was dark, the curtains still drawn, but I could hear voices now—two, maybe three, low and urgent, like an argument. I held my breath, straining to make out words, but they were muffled, too far away. The voices stopped as suddenly as they started, leaving only silence. I checked my watch—4:17 a.m. My mouth was dry, and my pulse wouldn’t slow. I thought about getting out to check, but something told me to stay put. I lay back down, staring at the ceiling of the cab, every creak of the truck making me jump. Sleep didn’t come again.By 7 a.m., the lot was brighter, though the quiet hadn’t lifted. I climbed out of the cab, my boots hitting the gravel with a crunch. The air smelled of diesel and stale coffee from the diner. I stretched, my back cracking, and decided to walk around my truck to check the tires before hitting the road. That’s when I saw it, behind the trailer, near the back axle. A body, sprawled out on the ground, half-hidden in the shadow of my rig. My stomach dropped. At first, I thought it was a pile of clothes or maybe someone sleeping off a rough night, but as I stepped closer, I saw her—the woman from last night.Her jacket was torn at the sleeve, her jeans scuffed with dirt. Her face was pale, her eyes open, staring at nothing. Dark bruises circled her neck, like someone had squeezed hard and didn’t let go. I stumbled back, my breath catching, my hands shaking. I wanted to yell for help, but my voice wouldn’t come. My legs felt like they might give out, but I forced myself to stay upright, to think.“Hey! You okay over there?” a voice called, snapping me out of it. A trucker, maybe in his fifties, with a gray beard and a flannel shirt, was walking toward me from his rig parked a few spaces down. He had a thermos in one hand, but when he saw my face, he stopped, his eyes flicking to the ground behind my trailer. “What’s—oh, man. Oh, no.” He dropped the thermos, coffee splashing on the gravel. “Is that… you didn’t do this, did you?”“No!” I said, my voice louder than I meant. “I just found her. I saw her last night, but I didn’t—I swear I didn’t do anything.”He studied me, his face hard, then looked back at the body. “This is bad, buddy. Real bad. Places like this… girls like her, they’re targets. I’ve heard stories. You don’t wanna know.”“What kind of stories?” I asked, my throat tight.He stepped closer, lowering his voice. “Guys out here, some of them ain’t right. Drifters, drivers, worse. They know these girls work alone, no one watching out for them. A few years back, I heard about a driver picking up girls like her, leaving them… like this. Cops never caught him.” He shook his head, his eyes darting around the lot. “You better call the police. Now.”My hands were still shaking as I pulled out my phone and dialed 911. The operator’s voice was calm, asking for details I could barely string together. “There’s a body,” I said, my voice cracking. “A woman, behind my truck. She’s… she’s dead. I don’t know what happened.”“Stay where you are,” the operator said. “Officers are on the way. Don’t touch anything.”I hung up and stood there, staring at the ground, trying not to look at her. The trucker stayed with me, pacing a little, muttering about how he should’ve left last night. Other drivers started to notice, a few walking over, keeping their distance but whispering to each other. I caught fragments—“another one,” “same as that girl in Erie,” “they never find who does it.” My stomach twisted tighter with every word.Two police cruisers pulled into the lot, lights flashing but no sirens. An officer with a notepad approached, his partner scanning the lot with a hand on his holster. “You the one who called?” the first officer asked, his voice clipped, his eyes locking onto mine.“Yeah,” I said. “I found her this morning. I didn’t touch her.”He nodded, but his expression didn’t soften. “Walk me through it. Everything you saw, everything you did.”I told him about seeing her last night, her offer, how I’d turned her down and gone to sleep. I mentioned the bang I’d heard, the voices in the dark, but I couldn’t give specifics. It felt like my brain was stuck, replaying the same awful moment of finding her. The officer wrote it all down, his pen scratching loud in the quiet.“You didn’t see anyone else with her?” he asked, glancing up. “No one hanging around your truck?”“No,” I said. “It was just her. I locked my cab and stayed inside.”He looked at me for a long moment, then turned to his partner. “Get the tape up. We need to secure this.” They strung yellow crime scene tape around my truck, and a small crowd of truckers gathered near the diner, watching, whispering. I heard one say, “They found a girl like this last year, couple hours from here. Never solved it.”The officer came back, his face serious. “We’re gonna need to search your truck. Dash cam, logbook, everything. You got anything in there we should know about?”“Nothing,” I said, handing him my keys. “It’s just my stuff. I didn’t do this.”They searched my rig for over an hour, checking every corner of the cab, the sleeper, even the trailer. I stood by, feeling the eyes of the other truckers on me, like they were sizing me up. The officer’s partner asked me more questions—where I was coming from, where I was headed, if I’d stopped here before. I answered as best I could, but the whole time, I kept seeing her face, those bruises, her empty stare.Finally, they let me go. “Your story checks out for now,” the first officer said, handing back my keys. “But I’d stay away from places like this. These stops, they’re not safe. Not for girls like her, not for drivers like you.”“What do you mean?” I asked, my voice low.He hesitated, then said, “We’ve seen this before. Girls working the lots, they go missing, or worse. Sometimes it’s a one-off, sometimes… it’s the same guy, moving from stop to stop. We don’t know yet. Just watch your back.”I nodded, but his words sank into me like a weight. I climbed back into my truck, locked the doors, and sat there, gripping the steering wheel. The lot was emptying out, trucks pulling away, but I couldn’t move yet. I kept thinking about the bang I’d heard, the voices, wondering if I’d been that close to whoever did this. I checked my mirrors, half-expecting to see someone standing there, but it was just the empty lot, the diner, the flickering light.When I finally pulled out, I kept glancing back, like something might follow me. I don’t stop at places like that anymore, not alone, not at night. But sometimes, when I’m driving late, I hear that bang in my head, or I catch a shadow in my mirrors, and I wonder if he’s still out there, waiting at the next stop, watching for the next one.

  


**""No Sleep on Exit 17"":**

I’ve been a trucker for nearly fifteen years, hauling everything from furniture to frozen goods across the country. Long hauls are my life, but they wear you down—the endless highways, the hum of the engine, the way time blurs into a haze of mile markers. I was on a run from Oregon to Ohio, carrying a load of handcrafted tables and chairs, the kind rich folks buy to impress their friends. I’d been driving since dawn, and my body was screaming for a break. My eyes stung, my back ached, and my coffee thermos had been empty for hours. The GPS said the nearest proper truck stop was still ninety minutes away, too far to push without risking a nod-off at the wheel.Then I saw it—a small dirt lot just off the highway, barely noticeable in the dark. It was nothing fancy, just a patch of gravel surrounded by dense trees, the kind of place you’d miss if you weren’t looking. No signs, no lights, just a faint path leading off the road. I hesitated, but exhaustion won out. I couldn’t keep going. I turned onto the gravel, my tires crunching loud enough to make me wince in the silence. The lot was empty, not a single car or truck in sight. Just me, my rig, and the black wall of trees closing in around me.I parked near the edge, facing the highway so I could pull out fast if needed. Habit, I guess. The engine ticked as it cooled, and the quiet settled in, thick and heavy. I climbed into the sleeper cab, my little home on the road. It’s a cozy setup—a narrow bed with a worn quilt, a mini-fridge with water and a couple of sandwiches, a photo of my old dog taped to the wall. I locked the doors, checked them twice, and drew the curtains tight. The cab felt safe, like a cocoon against the dark. I set my alarm for 4 AM, giving me a few hours to rest before the next leg. Fatigue hit like a wave, and I was out cold in minutes.A noise yanked me awake. At first, I thought it was part of a dream—a low, guttural sound, like a dog growling, but off, too human. My heart started pounding, and I lay still, straining to hear it again. There it was, louder, closer, right outside my cab. Barking, sharp and wild, but not from an animal. It was a man’s voice, rough and unhinged, barking over and over, each sound slicing through the quiet. My skin crawled, and I sat up, my quilt sliding to the floor.I reached for my phone, my hands shaking so bad I nearly dropped it. I flicked on the flashlight app and eased the curtain back, just enough to peek out. The beam caught a face pressed against my window, inches from the glass. He was older, maybe in his fifties, with a tangled beard and hair that looked like it hadn’t been washed in months. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, gleaming in the light, and his mouth was open, foam collecting at the corners as he barked again, a wet, guttural sound. His hands slapped the glass, leaving smears of dirt and spit, his fingers curled like claws.I yanked the curtain shut, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps. My heart was hammering so hard I thought it’d burst. Who was this guy? Was he drunk, high, or just out of his mind? Out here, alone, it didn’t matter. I was trapped in my cab, miles from help, with this lunatic pawing at my truck. The barking stopped for a second, replaced by a low mumble, words I couldn’t make out, like he was talking to himself. Then it started again, louder, more frantic, and the banging got harder, each hit shaking the cab.“Hey! Get away from my truck!” I shouted, my voice cracking. I don’t know if he heard me, but the barking turned into a snarl, and he pounded faster, the rhythm erratic, like he was losing control. I scrambled into the driver’s seat, fumbling for my keys on the floor. My hands were slick with sweat, and I dropped them twice before finally getting them into the ignition. The engine roared to life, the sound deafening in the quiet lot. The man howled, a raw, animal sound, and started slamming his whole body against the door, the metal groaning under the impact.I threw the truck into gear and started rolling, slow at first, my eyes darting between the road and the side mirror. He was running alongside me, his face twisted in rage, his arms flailing as he kept up with the truck. I couldn’t believe it—he was fast, too fast for a guy his size, his boots kicking up gravel as he chased me. I pressed the gas harder, the tires spinning before catching traction. He stayed with me longer than I thought possible, his silhouette in the mirror a blur of motion, his mouth open in a silent scream now that the barking had stopped.Finally, the highway opened up, and I floored it. He fell behind, his figure shrinking until he was just a speck in the darkness. I kept checking my mirrors, half-expecting him to reappear, sprinting out of the shadows like some nightmare that wouldn’t quit. My hands gripped the wheel so tight my knuckles turned white, and my chest felt like it was caving in. I drove for miles, the highway stretching out endless and empty, no cars, no lights, just me and the hum of the engine. I tried my phone, but there was no signal, just static on the screen. Calling for help wasn’t an option.After what felt like forever, I spotted a glow on the horizon—a real truck stop, the kind with neon signs and rows of rigs parked tight. I pulled in, my hands still trembling as I parked near the diner, where the lights were bright and warm. The lot was alive with activity—drivers walking to their trucks, the low rumble of engines, the clink of dishes from inside. I sat in the cab for a minute, trying to calm down, my breath fogging the windshield. I could still hear that barking in my head, see those wild eyes staring through the glass.I grabbed my jacket and headed into the diner, needing people around me, needing noise to drown out the fear. The place smelled of fried eggs, coffee, and cigarette smoke, and the hum of conversation was like a lifeline. I slid into a booth near the counter, my hands still unsteady as I ordered a black coffee. The waitress, a middle-aged woman with kind eyes, set the mug down and frowned. “You alright, hon? You look like you’ve seen something awful.”I took a sip, the heat grounding me a little. “Yeah, just… had a scare. Stopped at a dirt lot back there, off the highway. Some guy came up to my truck, barking like a dog, banging on the windows. Chased me when I drove off.”Her eyes widened. “Barking? That’s not something you hear every day. You okay?”“Shaken up, but yeah. Just glad to be here.”A driver in the next booth, an older guy with a gray beard and a flannel shirt, leaned over. “Heard that kind before. Had a fella in Nevada once, middle of nowhere, screaming nonsense at my rig. Thought he was gonna climb in. You call the cops?”“No signal out there,” I said, shaking my head. “And he’s probably gone by now.”Another driver, younger, with a buzz cut and a tattoo on his forearm, turned from the counter. “Happened to me too, couple years back. Guy tried to jimmy my door open while I was sleeping. Woke up to him tugging at the handle. I yelled, and he bolted, but man, I didn’t sleep right for weeks.”The older guy nodded, sipping his coffee. “These remote spots, they’re cheap and quiet, but you’re rolling the dice. Folks out there, some are just down on their luck, but others… they’re not right. Drugs, mental stuff, who knows. You gotta stay sharp.”“What do you do to stay safe?” I asked, desperate for anything to make sense of it.“Lock your doors, always,” the older guy said. “Keep a flashlight handy, maybe something heavy nearby, like a tire iron. And don’t stop in places like that unless you got no choice. Stick to spots like this, where there’s people, lights.”The younger driver chimed in. “I got a dog now. Big mutt, rides with me. Barks like hell if anyone gets close. Best decision I ever made.”I nodded, taking it all in. The coffee was helping, warming my hands, calming my nerves. “Thanks, guys. I’m sticking to places like this from now on.”The older guy gave a small smile. “We all learn the hard way. You’ll be alright. Just keep your eyes open.”I stayed in the diner longer than I needed, listening to the drivers swap stories—some funny, some chilling. It felt good, being around people who got it, who knew the road and its dangers. But when I finally climbed back into my truck, I couldn’t shake the image of that man’s face, his spit-smeared mouth, his wild eyes. I checked the locks three times, peered out the windows into the brightly lit lot. No shadows moved, no barking broke the night, but my skin still prickled.I didn’t sleep much after that. Every creak of the truck, every distant sound, had me sitting up, heart racing. When I hit the road at dawn, I made a promise to myself: no more empty lots, no more taking chances. The highway life is lonely enough without inviting trouble. I still drive, still love the open road, but now I’m always watching, always waiting for a shadow in my mirrors, for a sound that doesn’t belong. That night changed me, carved a fear into me that no amount of coffee or diner talk can erase.",1,1748178151.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1kv1zfv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kv1zfv,What should I do with this space?,"Hi everyone!

I just moved into a new place and need help figuring out how to decorate my living room. I love the natural light and the space, but I’m not sure how to make it feel complete. The current setup has a large sectional, TV, and open space behind the couch that feels a little empty.

I’m considering a few ideas like: 
• Mounting the TV on the wall 
• Adding bookshelves or a mini library behind the couch or moving the couch all the way to the wall and adding more furniture (like a chair) •	Possibly creating a reading or work nook 
• Adding a coffee table and area rug to tie it together

I want a modern, cozy vibe. Open to other suggestions too! With plants or an olive tree

Any ideas, mockups, or inspo would be super appreciated. Thanks in advance!",5,1748178070.0,Decor,4,1.0,False
1kv1z5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1kv1z5u/home_maintenance_services/,Home Maintenance Services,"Alright, let’s dive into the wonderful world of odd-job repairs and maintenance for seniors or busy families. Picture this: it’s a sunny Saturday morning, and the air carries that delicious mix of coffee and freshly mowed grass. As you step outside, you notice a neighbor struggling with an overflowing garage or perhaps a senior down the street longing for those pesky leaky faucets to be fixed. That's your cue. 

You’ve got a unique opportunity to be a knight in shining armor—minus the horse, of course. The beauty of odd jobs is it’s all about connecting with the community and making life just a tad easier for those who need it most. You’re not just offering repairs; you’re providing peace of mind. For seniors, this can mean maintaining independence while having someone they trust to lend a hand. For busy families, it’s less stress, more time to spend together—magic, right?

So, how do you get the word out? Let’s talk marketing. Flyers are your friends here. Create a simple, eye-catching flyer that highlights your services. Use a friendly tone, perhaps sprinkle in a touch of humor (because who doesn’t love a good chuckle?), and include a few testimonials if you can. You want potential clients to feel like they’re hiring a neighbor, not just a service.

And don’t forget Nextdoor. It’s like the neighborhood coffee shop where everyone shares their needs and recommendations. Post about what you offer—everything from fixing squeaky doors to assembling furniture that you swear wanted to stay in the box. Include a call to action, like, “Need a hand? Just knock!” This makes it inviting and approachable.

Now, let’s reflect on the heart of what you’re doing. Each job isn't just a paycheck; it's an opportunity to build meaningful relationships. Engage with your clients. Listen to their stories.

1kv1y9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1kv1y9s/wander_taipei_alone_at_midnight_with_oyster/,Wander Taipei Alone At Midnight With Oyster Omelet Grease On Your Fingers,"Taipei isn't flashy. It's just calm, dense, and steaming with food and stories, all of it packed into corners that don’t ask for a crowd. Which makes it the ideal city for anyone moving through the world solo, one foot in front of the other, hunger as the compass.

There’s a kind of liberation in drifting through Taipei’s grid with no one to answer to and everything to discover. You land, shake off the jet lag, and step into a place that doesn’t care who you are, where you’re from, or what you're trying to escape. It just feeds you. Constantly.

Street food culture here isn’t about grabbing a quick bite on the go. It’s a ritual. A nightly descent into organized chaos where steel-topped carts hiss and clatter under fluorescent lights, and old women with ten thousand-yard stares flip scallion pancakes with military precision. There are no awkward solo-diner stares. No overenthusiastic waiters asking if you’re “just one.” You sidle up to a plastic stool, point at whatever’s sizzling, and join the quiet rhythm of a hundred others doing the same. Shilin Night Market? A carnival of meat on sticks, peanut ice cream rolls, fried chicken the size of your head. Raohe? More concentrated, a little grittier, with bowls of stinky tofu that perfume the air in ways that defy polite description. You either dive in or walk on. No one cares. That’s the beauty of it.

Bubble tea here isn’t a trend. It’s a birthright. Whether you like yours sludgy with taro and mochi balls or sharp with lemon and green tea bitterness, it’s made with speed and purpose, then handed over with zero ceremony. You sip and move on. There's no need to linger, no pressure to pose. Just you and your straw, dodging scooters and dodging responsibility.

Eating alone in Taipei doesn’t feel solitary. It feels tactical. You want that oyster omelet, the one folded onto a hot plate and doused with that strange, sweet-sour sauce that makes no sense and every kind of sense at once. You want it now. You get it. You eat. Then you chase it with grilled squid dipped in chili powder and a plastic cup of beer handed to you by a man who doesn’t speak English but nods with approval. Somewhere in the distance, karaoke blares through a cracked speaker. A temple bell chimes. A cat darts across your path, clearly in charge of the whole darn operation.

The subway is clean, fast, and eerily quiet. You descend into it when the city’s humid breath gets too heavy. You pop back up like a gopher in a different neighborhood. Da’an, Zhongxiao, wherever the food and instincts take you. There are coffee shops the size of broom closets where the barista is dead serious about pour-over ratios, and teahouses that look unchanged since the martial law days, offering a pot and a view with no expectations. You sip, zone out, and think about nothing.

Evenings stretch late. The city doesn’t sleep, it murmurs. You wander back to a shoebox hotel or a windowless room above a dumpling joint, the kind with fluorescent lighting and sheets that smell vaguely of bleach and old newspapers. It’s perfect. You crash, stomach full, senses fried, ears still ringing with scooter horns and someone shouting about gua bao in the distance.

Taipei doesn’t reward speed. It rewards curiosity. You don’t need a schedule, a partner, or an agenda. You need an appetite, a pocketful of coins, and a willingness to follow the scent of grilled something through an alley you didn’t plan on finding. There’s safety here too. Not just physical, though that’s a given, but emotional. This is a city that doesn’t demand your story. It just wants to feed you and move on. Maybe that’s all you needed anyway.

As the title says I’m curious about the fact of an ex coming back or try to rekindle things after they made themselves aware of their attachment style (more specifically avoidant and fearful avoidant). 

For context my (31 M) ex (26F) ended things between us in October 2024. And for the last 2 months we had been in no contact. Yesterday she saw me at the gym and came to say hi and catch up a little bit, at the end of our convo while saying goodbye I told her that was really nice seeing her and that maybe one day we could have some coffee. 30 minutes later I revived a text and well we had some coffee. 

She told me about her feeling that she is self sabotaging in all the relationships, that she haven’t been able to heal from relationships because she jumps into another just to numb herself. I told her that what she says it aligns with an avoidant tendency, at least for what I had read online. She then proceeded to do a test and yeah now she is aware that have some avoidant tendencies. As well she said she wants to be alone for a year or whatever she needs to try to “fix” herself. 

She is now gonna start therapy, and literally bought a book to try to understand and reflect on the way she connects with people. 

I would lie if I say that I’m not having some sparks of hope on maybe one day rekindle things. But for now I know it’s a thing she needs to do on her own. And I need to continue on the path of my own healing. But I hope in a future we can reconnect from a much healthier stance.

1kv1pkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrowthHacking/comments/1kv1pkt/career_pivot_breaking_into_growth_marketing/,Career pivot: breaking into growth marketing? Looking for advice from pros in the field,"Hey everyone!  
I'm exploring a career pivot into growth marketing (aka growth hacking) and would love to hear from those who’ve made the leap or are already working in the field.

**My Background & Why Growth**

* I have an MSc in Management and started self-teaching digital marketing during university (ran personal blogs and e-commerce side projects).
* My professional background is mostly in traditional industries (food, FMCG) in Southern Europe, where digital adoption is still developing and marketing teams are small.
* That’s made me a bit of a generalist: I’ve touched on performance, analytics, SEO, SEM, email, CRM, and some CRO.

In the last few years, I specialized in performance marketing (mainly Amazon Ads), with \~3 years of experience. I enjoy working with data, building scalable systems, and optimizing for measurable outcomes.

I’m not a ""creative"" in the traditional sense. I’m drawn more to the tech, data, and user psychology side of marketing. Many people say I think like an engineer. To me, marketing is actually about engineering a persuasive system to get the right product in front of the right person at the right time, profitably.

That’s why growth marketing excites me: it blends data, product thinking, experimentation, and impact.

**Career Pivot Context**

* Feeling stagnant, I recently accepted a promotion to brand manager hoping to move closer to product and strategy.
* While it expanded my scope, I found the role not aligned with my personality - and eventually, it led to burnout.
* So now I’m working on repositioning into digital again, and I believe growth marketing is the sweet spot where I can bring my background and interests together.

**What I’d Love to Learn from You**

1. How did you break into growth?
   * Did you come from performance, SEO, product, dev, analytics, or another path?
   * Did you start in a startup, agency, or as a freelancer?
2. What skills are most in demand for junior/entry-level growth roles?
   * Are companies leaning more toward technical skills (SQL, GA4, scripts, automation)?
   * Or is there more focus on creative strategy (funnels, landing pages, copywriting)?
3. What learning paths/resources helped you most?
   * Courses, books, newsletters, YouTube, communities — anything you’d recommend?
   * Did you follow a structured path or just learn by doing?
4. How can I accelerate learning through side projects or freelancing?
   * Any small projects or freelance gigs that helped you build a portfolio or gain confidence?
5. Any blind spots or common mistakes people make when breaking into growth?
   * I want to approach this seriously and avoid spinning my wheels on low-leverage stuff.

**TL;DR:**

* Background: 3 YOE in performance marketing (Amazon ads), MSc in business, generalist turned specialist, burnout from brand role
* Now: Looking to pivot into growth marketing
* Ask: How did you break in? Skills to focus on? Learning resources? Good side projects?

2 days ago I wrote this text, which was my first post on this subreddit in six years. [https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1ktshkw/12\_years\_of\_limerence\_i\_am\_so\_tired/](https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1ktshkw/12_years_of_limerence_i_am_so_tired/)

I feel so much better today. Writing and reading it finally sobered me up. I feel so light I could fly.

Although that post is long, it didn't even cover one per percent of what I have been going through in my head. Yesterday I found a long text I sent to a fellow limerent soon after the breakup.

So if anyone is interested, here is how it felt being with my LO for 6 years.

""For me it was love at first sight. We met at some random event, and it felt like magic, like darn Hollywood cheesy romance. We saw each other across the room, and it was like he was the only person in the room. Total cliche. He came to me, and we started to talk. For the first time in my life I felt this strong urge to touch someone, to throw myself into his arms and never let go.

We were both in quite serious relationships at the time. Despite that, he asked for my mobile number, and I gave it to him without thinking for a split second. 3 days later, he texted me with some lame excuse; he needed help with something within my field of work, blah blah. A few days later, he was ""accidentally"" near my workplace and invited me for coffee. I was already on the lunch break with a friend, so I said he could come and join us. The moment he sat down, my friend started to act strange, said she was in a hurry and left. Later she apologised and said she couldn't stand the energy and the tension between us. Since she was also a good friend with my BF at the time, she was very confused and didn't know how to react. That coffee with him was something else. He made me feel like I was the only woman in the universe. He was drilling through me with his eyes, moving closer by the minute until our faces were like 10 cm apart. I had his undivided attention and felt desired like never before.

I didn't know what was happening. I couldn't talk to anyone about this. I was afraid of being judged for having these feelings. I felt ashamed and guilty and scared and didn't know what was going on. I am not the person who cheats on their partner. I was in love before. I was always in love, since kindergarten. Had my heart broken, broke same hearts too along the way. But the feelings I felt for him were just too much. Out of this world. So I started talking to myself, putting my feelings on a computer. Still didn't make any sense, but at least I put it somewhere.

An entrance from a journal, two weeks after we met: ""What the fuck is wrong with me?! Why am I this obsessed? Why am I thinking about him every fucking moment of the day? I need to end this now, before something evolves and it will hurt even more. I can't imagine saying no to him. I want him to touch me, kiss me, I want to fuck him so bad. Never in my life have I had this intense urge to have sex with someone. This is how poor guys feel most of the time; :) I don't want to hurt my BF. (of 5 years at the time). I don't want to lose him. I have to end this today. No more coffees, no more texts, nothing. This is so hard. Help me, I can't do this. I'm so scared :'( ""

Of course I didn't stop it. I was on cloud nine (ten), being with him was the best drug ever. I never tried heroin or sth. but I guess this must be it, this feeling of completeness. When the whole world disappears. We started to see each other on a regular basis, at first 5 times a week, then 3 times, then only once a week, in any case, not enough for me. I could be with him 60/24/7/366. Even though he fucked me with his eyes every time we were together, he didn't touch me for two months. I guess we pretended we were some kind of friends or something. All he did were small, almost accidental touches with his knee or elbow. Slightly touching my shoulder while saying goodbye was the climax of the affair. I was the most beautiful, smart, interesting, and desirable woman alive. It didn't take long until we slept together, and the sex was, as you can imagine, the best sex I ever experienced. First times are always awkward, but not with him. Perfect from the first second to the last. After that his attitude changed, only a tiny bit, but I sensed it since I'm hyper aware of how people around me feel and, in his case, even more. I pushed that aside since I was sooooooooooo in love. It took another two months for me to figure out I can't live this double life anymore, so I ended things with my BF.

It took him almost a year to leave his GF and I agonised about that even though I was the other woman. It was at that time I realised (I convinced myself on the basis of his actions) I was so much more into him than he was into me. He texted and initiated less and less, sometimes ignoring my msg for a whole day. When he would text me, I would respond in minutes, then he would respond hours later. I was losing my mind. I started to have panic attacks if he didn't respond to my text in 5 minutes. If I texted anyone else, it was understandable they couldn't respond right away, but in his case I didn't understand it. He is very busy, I know that. He owns his own business, workaholic; he does public events, so I know he doesn't lie about the amount of work he has. But still I couldn't understand; he doesn't text me within minutes, much less for the whole day. I cried sitting on the toilet at work, even threw up a couple of times and called in sick. His absence was physically painful to me. I was scared he would never leave his GF, I was scared he was seeing other girls, I was scared he hated me, and I was convinced every other girl on this planet wants him as much as I want him. My anxiety started to grow, and I knew he was not good for my mental health. I had a major episode of depression years before that, and I knew what mental sickness means. So after 8 months of being ""together"", I had my first breakdown when I couldn't hold it in any more. I told him I can't do this anymore. I have to feel secure, I have to feel he loves me. I wanted him to leave his GF. He got scared and started to apologise, told me I am his everything, an oasis in the middle of his shitty life, blah blah blah, and promised to leave his GF so we can be together. I believed everything. Was so happy. For a few months things were better; I was more relaxed, and eventually he finally broke up with his GF. But things didn't change. He spent the exact same time with me as before. I pictured this happy life for us together forever. Haha, little did I know.

The cycles began. Every 6 months or so I broke, telling him the same things that hurt me, telling him I can't stand the thought of losing him, but I also can't stand this eternal limbo I'm in. He would then repeat my words from a previous breakdown. He knew them by heart(?!), told me I worry too much, reassured me he loves me, and said I would forget all the bad things. Again, for a few months, things were better, until they were not. Cycle after cycle for 6 years. Lost almost all of my friends because I would never make time for them in case he called. Had to look perfect all the time in case he calls. This was exhausting on its own. Even went to therapy I never told him about because of this obsession. Helped for a short period of time. I didn't want to go away, so I couldn't go away. You see the pattern. I was never that girl. I never let anyone play with me or my emotions. I was never that stupid. My mother raised me better than that. Two months ago I had my last breakdown, and he didn't even try. He didn't even have the guts to say it straightforwardly; it was over. He was just mumbling some bull about timing and blah blah whatever and getting his shit together. The only thing I really remember from that day are his empty eyes I saw for the first time. His hands not touching me for the first time ... It killed me. That day, on that cup of coffee, it died. We died. I died. It hurts. At the end he said that we will hear from each other, but I just smirked at him and said, ""Will we?"" He smiled, quite surprised, because it was not the response he expected. He expected pleas to call or to make time for coffee. But no. I said goodbye, turned around and left. He then drove past me, stopped for a bit, let his window down, smiled and waved at me like everything was perfectly fine. What an idiot. It was the last time I saw or heard from him.

I was so hurt. I honestly didn't want to see him for some time. I cried for a week. He hasn't contacted me to this day. I'm doing NC first and foremost for myself. It took me approx. a month to really see how miserable I was in this relationship. How many times I swallowed my pride, how many times I let him get away with things he knew drove me insane. How many times I cried, hoped, waited, and grinned my teeth just not to make a scene. I would do anything for him, and that was my general ""mistake"". I don't blame myself for being who I am. I don't think loving someone and showing it is a mistake. I believe blaming yourself and/or others does not solve anything.""",2,1748177001.0,limerence,1,0.75,False

1kv1mk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/1kv1mk0/why_is_the_dating_scene_in_scotland_so_poor/,Why is the dating scene in Scotland so poor?,"I do not mean this in a rude way towards scottish women or men, I am Scottish man myself. But I have lived in England the last couple years, and then I spent some time in the US. I did a little bit of dating in both England and in the US, and although I never ended up in any long term relationships there, simply because there was a lack of a ""spark,"" most of the women I met there were very good people. They were kind and all beautiful, we had very good conversations even though in most cases we didnt have a lot in common, and either myself or them didn't want to persue a relationship after 2-3 dates, and I still remain good friends with a couple of them.

I got back to Scotland from the US about 8 months ago. I'll be living here permanently, I'm 26 and I'm hoping for a long term relationship now, so I've started getting back into dating, and after just a few months I have basically rung all the dating apps dry. Ive been on first dates with about 15-20 women, and only two second dates which did not progress further. The issues that im running into constantly are:

-most women ive met with do not want a serious relationship.

-almost all the women ive met, although all beautiful, have the exact same aesthetic (fake tan, hair extensions, vapes, full face make up, north face jacket, gym clothes constantly, etc) there is nothing wrong with this look, i do not have a problem with it or women who like this look at all, these women were all beautiful, however its just not what im attracted to, at all, and women who dont dress like this seem to be scarce in scotland.

-unfortunately, most of the women I've met have just been rude. I don't know if its an age bracket thing thats a problem with people our age, or if we just didn't click, but I had to carry the conversation the whole dates, they just seemed so uninterested, complained about one thing or another, and just seemed generally unhappy to be there, while still expecting me to pay if we were on a dinner or coffee date. What shocked me was that almost all the women I had this issue with suggested a second date, so I know I was not the problem.


Again, I am not trying to be rude towards Scottish women at all, I am Scottish myself, and I am sure there is plenty women could complain about when it comes to dating men. I guess my point is just that I am getting older now, I see my friends and family in happy relationships, and I am starting to worry that I'll just never find someone I actually like and who likes me. I might just be too picky, but I didn't have this problem dating in England or in the US. Just wondering if anyone else noticed this?

Stop treating emotions like a compass.  
""Feeling good"" isn’t guidance.. it’s neurological bribery.  
Heroin hits feel amazing. So does power. So does murder for some.  
You think bliss = truth? Then syringe junkies are sages.

**Feelings don’t lead you anywhere. They keep you hooked.**  
The system exploits you by using your own chemical puppet strings:  
Dopamine for compliance.  
Serotonin for sedation.  
Fear for control.  
Love for leash.

Even your ""intuitions"" are pre-coded impulses.  
Your joy isn’t insight.. it’s the carrot on the stick.  
Your pain isn’t transformation.. it’s electric livestock fencing.

The entire idea that emotion = meaning

## Key Features Analysis

The performance of a Frigidaire water filter depends on a variety of technical specifications. Ranging from micron ratings to filter lifespan, discerning these features is paramount for choosing the proper water filtration device for your system.

**Micron Rating:** The micron rating indicates the size of particles the filter can effectively remove. Frigidaire filters typically have a micron rating between 0.5 and 5 microns.This rating signifies the filter's ability to capture sediment, rust, chlorine taste and odor, and other impurities. A lower micron rating indicates a more effective filtration process, capable of removing smaller particles.

The micron rating is crucial as it directly impacts the purity and taste of the water. Filters with a higher micron rating might not remove all the smaller contaminants, perhaps affecting water quality. Frigidaire filters are designed to meet specific standards for contaminant reduction, and this rating helps ensure that the water produced is safe and palatable.

**Filter Lifespan:** The lifespan of a Frigidaire water filter generally ranges from 6 months or 200 gallons of water, whichever comes first. This lifespan ensures that the filter continues to effectively remove contaminants before its filtration capacity is tired. Regular replacement is essential to maintain optimal water quality and prevent the release of previously trapped impurities back into the water supply.

The recommended replacement schedule is crucial because a saturated filter can become a breeding ground for bacteria and lose its ability to filter effectively. Frigidaire refrigerators often include indicator lights or alerts to remind users when it's time to replace the filter, promoting timely maintenance and ensuring consistent water quality.

**Filtration Technology:** Frigidaire water filters utilize activated carbon filtration technology to remove impurities. Activated carbon is a highly porous material that attracts and traps contaminants as water passes through it. This process effectively reduces chlorine taste and odor, sediment, rust, and other organic compounds, enhancing the overall quality of the water.

Activated carbon filtration is widely used due to its effectiveness and cost-efficiency. The surface area of the activated carbon provides ample space for contaminants to adhere to, resulting in significantly cleaner water.Some advanced filters may also incorporate additional filtration layers or technologies to target specific contaminants, resulting in even higher water purity.

**Certification:** Frigidaire water filters are often certified by independent organizations such as NSF International. NSF certification ensures that the filters have been tested and meet specific standards for contaminant reduction. This certification provides consumers with confidence in the filter's performance and safety.

NSF certification validates that the filter effectively reduces the contaminants it claims to remove. It also ensures that the filter materials are safe for use in drinking water applications and do not leach harmful substances into the water supply.Looking for NSF certification is a critical factor when selecting a Frigidaire water filter.

Key features of Frigidaire water filters include:

* Advanced filtration technology
* certified performance
* Optimal filter lifespan
* compatibility with various refrigerator models.

* review items for today in planner (which stores all information for the future) while coffee is brewing

the only thing for today from planner is a reminder that by today my lower body should be recovered from my prior workout and i can therefore work lower body again.

* add any **non-urgent** items from planner to whiteboard for execution during hidden idle time *(all tasks other than errands can be broken into 'nothing burgers' \[under 15 minutes\] which can easily fit into already-existing but hidden idle time)*

here is the updated board with lower body added:

https://preview.redd.it/454rtaw6lw2f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=56acdd543e0f744735eb2083260c2b18869969cb

the '5' in 'upper 5 > lower' means five o'clock and the '> lower' means that i'm prioritizing upper body over lower body.

* create alarms for any items from planner that **must be done today**

for various reasons, i'm testing a slight variation on this where i'm not creating alarms for all must-do tasks, but only those which really need an alarm. if i end up liking this variation, i'll create a version 5.1 with the change.

so, you'll notice some 'elevated' items on the whiteboard above with something of a hierarchy of \[no suffix\] > black asterisk > red asterisk > red number (where the number is a time of day. 

if you look at the board items encoded thusly, you'll see this makes sense bc, for example, working my upper body will be the most important thing at 5pm but until then it's not even actionable.

and 'grocery > cook' has to do with food per my food > hygiene > exercise priorities.

and vacuuming is more important than cleaning filters bc it's a more frequent periodic activity.

* review **text** messages while computer is booting up and, for each item requiring a reply/action, 1) immediately address, 2) create alarm to address today or 3) copy/paste into an email to myself to address in future

n/a as i currently have no unaddressed text messages

* review **email** messages and, for each item requiring a reply/action, 1) address immediately, 2) create alarm to address today or 3) snooze/punt to a later date

i'm no longer going to comment on every email i processed but instead just items that represent different scenarios.

for example, there were a number of items that i simply used email to capture but which belong on the board so i move them to the board and here is the updated board (i marked new items from email with a red arrow for you):

https://preview.redd.it/xu0zp3m9vw2f1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c8c52b333b5eaa370a15330d1ca5b029cf63c9e

other than those, i only thing i think is worth pointing out is that, while i 'moved' *print tableau portfolio* to the board above, the email remains in my inbox, albeit in a read state (so that it doesn't show in banner count on home screen or otherwise distract me).

i'm keeping it in my inbox bc it contains the files that i need to print out.

i have other similar items that i also leave in my inbox bc they have attachments or information in them and as long as there are many of them (currently there are only three) i see no need to even bother moving the information elsewhere and also the other two are actually convenient to have in my inbox bc, for example, one of them is a funny audio that i purchased and actually want to remember to listen to.

there is indeed a final thing worth pointing out vis a vis email review and that is regarding the reminder to use my italian restaurant gift card which is PERFECT for today bc i didn't end up cooking chicken yesterday bc i was (very happily) out all day yesterday at my daughter's graduation, hiking and visiting with a good friend.

so today i'm going to enjoy splurging at chipotle for lunch (also free using award points) and at the italian restaurant for dinner.

life is good!!!

oh yeah i almost forget. i'm 'implementing' a reminder of this via an 11am (an hour before lunch) 'chipotle > italian' alarm (which i'll reschedule to 3pm (an hour before dinner) after it sounds to remind me about lunch.

oops i keep lying to you bc i forgot there is one last thing and that is that i might want to go for a big hike today but let's address that in the next 'confirm today's plan' step but i wanted to mention it here bc email was the mechanism by which i was reminded about this.

* review alarms to cleanup from yesterday and confirm today's plan

alright so, after cleaning up alarms from yesterday, there are only two alarms for today (which i'm very happy about since having too many alarms didn't work out well at all):

    08:00 a.m. bring guitar equipment in from car (i didn't want to disturb neighbors by making noise too early, especially on a weekend morning)
    11:00 a.m. chipotle > italian

ok, so, knowing that i want to do a big hike today and after reviewing the above alarms (which are merely reminders; not tasks or activities) and the items on the board (none of which are must-do tasks and also can be done tomorrow bc of the holiday or wednesday bc i'm taking a day off) i'm very excited bc i realize that i absolutely can hike today and plan to do so after a giant breakfast at home and, after the hike (and instead of chipotle), i'm going to indulge in a massive high calorie post hike meal at a wonderful barbeque place right outside where i'm going to be hiking!

life is good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

oh man, even better i decided to 'send out a bat signal' to my kids by letting them know i'm going hiking and they're going to join me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

*i want to move some considerations to this step from my emails messages bc this is a better place for daily considerations vs having to snooze multiple things everyday in email.*

* *Balance self vs others/Reddit and Reddit community is 'out there' vs 'in here'*
* *Things tend to work themselves out / clarity*
* *There is usually nothing urgent and I always rise to the occasion*
* *Food in the bowl. Water in the bucket. (AKA food, hygiene and exercise)*
* *Striving toward some theoretical end point*

I love the outdoors, nature, autumn, walking, and hiking. I also love chocolates and coffee. I play various mobile games. I am interested in psychology and mental health. I identify as a demisexual, meaning I prefer emotional connections before physical ones. I am sex favourable but it can come much later when we both are equally comfortable. I enjoy hugging, cuddling, holding hands, and kissing.

I am looking for a deep connection and a possible serious relationship. I want to meet someone between 30 and 40 years old. I like smart, geeky masculine men, with a sense of humour, who have different hobbies and are willing to try new activities with me. It's important that my partner is open-minded and interested in learning about new cultures. I am open to long-distance relationships and can consider moving in the future. Being honest and open from the start is essential. I am unsure about having children, but I am open to the idea. If my partner wants kids and we are comfortable with each other, I could consider having one or two.

I value independence and want someone who is not emotionally dependent. I want to spend quality time with my partner and be best friends.

350g brown sugar  
225g melted butter  
3g instant coffee  
5k vanilla extract  
4 eggs  
2 egg yolkes

mix

120g cocoa powder  
5g baking powder  
5g salt  
Went with 130g flour. Now I'm thinking I should've gone with more?

mix 

120ml vegetable oil

mix gently so the oil doesn't separate

Baked for 35 minutes in 175C. 

The edges came out cakey, almost crunchy.

""Catherine, sit down","# Irresistible Boss: Succumbing to Your Touch by Maria Anita I HAVE THIS NOVEL, Does anyone want to read it ????

Author: Maria Anita



I got home after a long day, and my parents were waiting for me in the living room.



""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated.



""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible.



""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said.



""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry.



""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin.""



""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. That's not something she should do.""



I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, having sex with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin.



""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town.""



""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a slut..."" I lost my patience.



""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior.""



""I'm what?"" I thought I had heard wrong.



""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong.



""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying.



""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final.""



""But, Dad...""



""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument.



I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future.



At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. So they agreed that I should take advantage of it.



""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging.



I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city.



""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!""



I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. On Saturday, we got ready at her place.



""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?""



""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""



""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind.""



When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said:



""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat.""



""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?""",1,1748175640.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

Just silence and the quiet ache of two people who care but aren’t sure how to reach each other anymore.

It’s not broken. Just distant.
Not cold. Just quiet.

I read something that captured that feeling in a way that felt real. Not advice. Not judgment. Just an honest reflection on how love evolves, and how presence sometimes matters more than passion.

This exploratory endeavor seeks to demystify the sequence of events commonly encountered upon the commission of a faux pas—specifically, the curious case where one finds oneself adorned in the proverbial blush.

Our subject tonight centers on an impromptu, yet inadvertent, overshare during a conversational exchange that disrupted social equilibrium, inducing a pronounced rush of cutaneous crimsoning prominent in the facial region, particularly the cheeks. Initial observation reveals a dual-stage process: a precipitating verbal miscalculation followed by a pronounced physiological response characterized by dilation of dermal vessels—colloquially understood as blushing—transiently afflicting the epidermal layer.

This analysis involves rigorous stage-by-step scrutiny of the aforementioned verbal misalignment during a social discourse—one where I might've prematurely voiced an opinion on reality TV drama that was perhaps not universally shared among my peers. The resultant awkward silence was empirically measured in subjective time, lasting approximately three eternally harrowing seconds, followed by the physical manifestation of heat and the peculiar hue referred to herein as 'embarrassment red.'

Notably, this observable blush triggers what I hypothesize to be a copious dispersion of self-consciousness hormones (hypothetical terminology), originating in the cortex and cascading rapidly through the emotional processing centers. Simultaneously, an involuntary cognitive replay attempts, albeit in vain, to rectify the social gaffe, thus exacerbating the crimson flush.

In conclusion, the delicate art of social interaction demands an understanding of emotional dynamics akin to a balancing act on a tightrope of interpersonal etiquette. The phenomena of blushing, awkward pauses, and internally cringing all play their roles in this grand experiment of human relations. As data collection continues, I'm left hypothesizing: perhaps increased exposure to such social stimuli could diminish the intensity of reactions, a sentiment surely worth further exploration over a comforting cup of coffee and a re-run of my favorite chill TV show.",6,1748175201.0,feelingsUnderMicrosco,0,1.0,False
