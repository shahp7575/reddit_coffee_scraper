1k8gikb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/1k8gikb/cistanche_review_incredible_effects/,Cistanche Review - incredible effects,"Wanted to drop my review of the full spectrum 700mg Cistanche from ND. Been taking it the past 4 days and wow the effects have been incredible for me. Probably my favorite nootropic so far.

I stacked it with 2 cups of coffee and 1.5g of taurine, here are the effects that I feel:

Feeling that like ""chilled spine"" or like nice tingly skin feeling, feeling super energetic/peppy, decently stimulated, less stressed out, really great mood, overall just feeling amazing. This lasts about half the day. Taking a 2nd dose without coffee around 2PM is less stimulating and more relaxing than the 1st dose. Feels like I'm getting better sleep as well.

I haven't noticed any tolerance so far, hoping that the effects will continue with daily use. Prior to trying Cistanche, I was going through some major problems with mood and low drive while at work. This stack seems to have given me a complete 180 in regard to that so looking forward to seeing how it goes long term.",2,1745683823.0,NootropicsDepot,0,1.0,False

I knew she had been engaging in some domme groups and was excited about the new friendships, both online and irl. So I suggested a game of pass the piggy, which neither of us had tried yet, in hopes it would make her popular with her domme friends.

Her excitement was palpable, even through text. We decided to do a reimbursement pass the piggy game, she would add me in a group chat, she and her dommes would sends receipts as they went about their day, and I would reimburse each as they came in. She added a rule, if I took longer than 10-minutes to send for one, I owed every girl in the group that amount‚Ä¶ this made me absolutely glued to my phone.

she invited me to a group chat with 3 other dommes (4 including her). They all immediately told me how fucked I would be today, which of course only got me more excited. This was around 11am.

In the next two hours, I received lunch bills from each, and boba/coffee from 3. I then intermittently received Ubers, groceries, snacks, a Lulu haul and a small Sephora bill. By 4pm I was already approaching my budget, and we hadn‚Äôt even gotten to dinner and drinks yet‚Ä¶

I unfortunately tapped out soon after and all 4 girls were happy to let me off the hook from there. They all sent me a cute selfie with either a middle finger or an L, reminding me of my place.

My domme decided to come over and we ordered in dinner (I paid, of course), and kicked it over some drinks for the rest of the night. She told me she was proud of me for the game, and we should play an evening round next time I was ready.

1k8g9q5,https://i.redd.it/w2u72zc777xe1.jpeg,Runnnn Uphot,"I bought this new espresso brewer from Runnnn, the Uphot, and since there is almost no content available that isn't from the Runnnn themselves, I thought I would share my user experience. The lack of user content made me a little skeptical, but I guess it's a fairly new and very niche product.

  
I am happy to share that it works exactly as shown in Runnns many youtube shorts. Brewing is easy and very satisfying. I bought the CO2 cartridge adapter. It can apparently be used with all kinds of bicycle pumps too if desired, but the CO2 thing seems pretty smart in my opinion. The manometer on the brewer makes it easy to adjust brewing pressure while brewing, in order to ""preinfuse"" and possibly experiment with different brewing pressures. The only thing that's not ideal to me is that the output can't be weighed while brewing, so you have to eyeball the output judging the volume, but I obviously knew this going in. So far the coffee has been really great :).

Quality seems very impressive. All pieces are really beautiful. It's heavy and nicely put together. The only thing I can see wear out is the seals, which is to be expected. They look to be really easy to replace, so my only concern would be how easy they are to find replacements for. The brewer comes with a bunch of spare seals, so theres that. I bought the bag too, which is also really nicely made and the brewer fits well inside. I don't like the name of this thing, so I would have liked it better if they didn't brand it with the black band, but that's my only small complaint.

  
Cleanup is easy enough, but I don't know how easy it would be to brew multiple shots back to back. I haven't tried yet, but I think it's best suited for brewing just one shot at a time.

  
I bought this to take with me camping. I see it as a fun toy that allows for me to enjoy my hobby while camping outside, which I think is pretty awesome. I think I have an easy time brewing tasty espresso on this because I have already learned to brew on a ""normal"" machine, so it may not be the best idea to buy one as your first and only brewer. The compact nature of it, and the fact that it can brew without electricity was the main selling point for me, and I think this product is targeted a specific use case in that way.

Five flights of stairs had taken their toll on his heavy frame. The elevator had been broken in my friend‚Äôs apartment building for as long as I could remember. A simple ‚ÄúIn Service‚Äù sign taped to the metal doors had been there long enough too yellow with age.¬†¬†¬†

The man sucked greedily on the lukewarm glass of water I had offered him. I watched his throat convulse with each gulp. I fidgeted awkwardly with my hands, fighting back nervous energy.¬†¬†

He slapped the glass down on a makeshift coffee table, using his handkerchief again to wipe daintily at his fat lips.¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll say again, it was no easy trick finding you young man. But I believe it is in both of our best interests that I follow through on your mother‚Äôs last wishes.‚Äù His heavy southern accent was nearly slurred with enthusiasm.¬†

My sofa groaned in complaint as he reached down for his bulging leather briefcase.¬†¬†¬†

I sat very still, absorbing his words. Words that had convinced me to invite him inside. My mother, a woman I had never met, was dead. This would not be the first time I had mourned for her. Aunt Heather had never spoken of any of my family. For my entire life, I had nothing but my imagination to go off. The women had withheld any and all information from me. About who I was, where I came from, and how I had ended up in her care. Now, an early onset of dementia permanently concealed her secrets.¬† I hadn‚Äôt spoken to her in years.¬†¬†¬†

This man offered me an open door when I had been clawing at boarded-up windows. For someone like me, it seemed too good to be true.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYour mother had tried to find you before her unfortunate demise.‚Äù Lunceford continued, ‚ÄúBut your Aunt Lydia covered both of your tracks with astonishing proficiency.‚Äù¬†

I shot him a look over the coffee table, ‚ÄúLydia? My aunt‚Äôs name was Heather.‚Äù¬†

Lunceford sighed heavily, shaking his head and smiling with insincere compassion. ‚ÄúHer name was Lydia, Adam, and she took you from your mother when you were a child.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBullshit.‚Äù¬†

The word was out of my mouth, startling even me with its force. I stood up abruptly, folding my arms across my chest, my fingers digging into my skin. My nervous energy was getting the better of me.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre some kind of scammer, you‚Äôre shit at it. Look at this dump.‚Äù I gestured at the dimly lit space around us. ‚ÄúI got $6‚Äôs in spare change and a negative in the bank. Have at it.‚Äù¬†

Mr. Lunceford‚Äôs mouth curved in a wide open ‚Äúoh‚Äù, his careful cadence thrown off by my reaction.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNow, now Mr. Davidson.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMills.‚Äù I corrected. Growing more frustrated with the conversation.¬†

‚ÄúMr. Mill‚Äôs.‚Äù Lunceford said carefully, his southern diphthongs stretched as he purred on, ‚ÄúI hate to be the one to explain this to you, but you are a victim of kidnapping.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBullshit,‚Äù I scoffed again, quieter than before.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMr. Mill‚Äôs, how difficult has it been for you to secure a job with no social security card? I see that your aunt chose to homeschool you rather than send you to a county school. If I had to guess, you can‚Äôt remember the last time you have been to a medical clinic of any kind. I doubt very highly that you have any form of insurance. Would I be correct in saying so?‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt respond, anger at his self-assurance waring with surprise at his accuracy.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYour mother, Mrs. Ruth Davidson, was my client. She left everything to you son. She loved you very much.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

My skepticism wouldn‚Äôt let me accept it. Not yet.¬†¬†

‚ÄúConvenient you are finding me now, just after she has passed.‚Äù¬†¬†

Mr. Lunceford shook his great head again, his jowls shaking. ‚ÄúOh son, she passed about a year ago. I‚Äôve been searching for you for some time. We have your aunt to thank for this here meeting.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHeather?‚Äù I asked, confused.¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to think of it son. A change in heart? A slip of clarity through her condition? Who can say. All I know son, is by some act of God, she went back home, looking for her sister. After that, it was easy to trace her steps back to you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhere is she now?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWe helped transport her back to her residence. That‚Äôs a nice place she‚Äôs set up at. Lovely facility.‚Äù¬†

It wasn‚Äôt. It was a state-run hovel that reeked of urine and bleach. The staff treated its residents with the tender care of correctional officers to death row prisoners. I had only been there once. It had been enough.¬†

‚ÄúIs she alright?‚Äù Curiously, I felt a twinge of guilt for not visiting her. As cold as she had been, she was the only family that I had. Now‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt know what to feel. Had I been right to hate her all this time?¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine son. Just a little confused as you well know.‚Äù He shifted. The sofa creaked. ‚ÄúMr. Davidson, I have her will here with me. If you don‚Äôt mind, I would like to read it to you. Perhaps that will help clear up this fog for you.‚Äù¬†

I wavered, not wanting to give in to whatever act this man was putting on. Still, I needed to know more. And by more, I meant anything. If I had a family out there that had cared about me, I needed to know. It was possible that I had other relatives that had survived her. I could listen to what Mr. Lunceford had to say, then decide whether to believe it or not.¬†

I sat carefully back down in my chair, eyeing him suspiciously.¬†¬†

Mr. Lunceford smiled, obviously pleased with my actions. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Mr. Davidson, we‚Äôll bring you back to the fold in no time.‚Äù",2,1745682911.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1k8g400,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_yaYeetISmellYourFeet/comments/1k8g400/im_out_of_ideas_on_how_to_meet_people_and_no_one/,"I'm out of ideas on how to meet people, and no one wants friends anyways","This is an absolutely massive rant so **TLDR** I'm in my early 20s and tried a lot of things to meet new people in similar position to mine, but all the attempts either led me to people I can't relate to, and everyone my age simply doesn't seem to be interested in making friends. When I try to meet people they seem uniterested or I feel extremely out of place and nothing ends up happening. I like random spontaneuos activities but everyone is busy or not bothered, and I just want to find people who feel the same way as me so I made a discord server for London [https://discord.gg/HnjS8VBSu9](https://discord.gg/HnjS8VBSu9) and I also beg someone to change my mind because I'm really getting desparate

Like many people who post here, I feel quite lonely. I moved here over 2 years ago and barely made any friends the whole time, my boyfriend is my only friend and he feels the same - it's just boring without friends. We constantly try to do something on the weekend, go on adventures and holidays, but it still feels empty.

A lot of people who have these problems tend to not do much about it or just have no idea where to start, but I feel like I exhausted the options now and it's not really working (I'll go over each attempt and why). I understand that to make connections you need to do something regularly and see the same people but there's really not much opportunity for that besides work. If there is something it's usually far away and costs money.

I also noticed this trend of people doing things on their own all the time, or the only things in their life being work and decompressing at home. You meet up with these people once a month, ""catch up"" and that's it, you don't actually do anything together. Eventually you run out of things to tell them because you're not doing anything. I don't even know if someone like that is even a friend at that point.

Generally I don't like structured, scheduled activities much, I definitely prefer spontaneuos things with no plan - go shopping then end up god knows where doing god knows what, but for that you need good friends and you need them nearby, and you need them to be willing. A lot of people you ask either already have plans for something else or they can't be bothered to go out. But either way you need those friends in the first place so here's a **few things that I tried**

I'd like to preface this with the fact that I don't drink and don't like going to drinking oriented events due to childhood trauma, and also I'm foreign (and possibly neurodivergent?) so there is a chance people just don't like me because when something for me is ""neutral"", to British people it might seem as ""rude"" and ""weird""

**Befriending my coworkers**

I didn't really get along with the group of people who joined at the same time as me so a loss. I did get along with 2 girls and we were very close in the first year, but then we fell out over a few things, then drifted apart because I stopped going to the office, and then got relocated to client site. We're technically still on good terms but we just don't see each other much and they're both busy with their own lives, so we only get the dreaded catch ups once in a while.

My company is also quite big on social events, both company organised ones and people organising their own things. I used to go to those a lot but everyone already had their own cliques and it was very difficult to join any conversation, so over time I stopped going to these events unless it's something I'd do without caring about what other people do (e.g. movie trips). Otherwise I feel like a ghost at best and being viewed as the weird girl with no friends at worst

Generally I get along ok with the people I work with on my team, but besides team organised activities it doesn't really go anywhere. As soon as the project is over no one cares. Any social activities that happen are pub and as mentioned above I can't do pub.

**Hobbies**

I like a variety of things but video games and arts and crafts are probably the things I do most. These are unfortunately alone activities. When I try finding people who like gaming they usually like competitive shooters, while I'm more of a indie story game and couch coop type girl so no luck. I really miss meeting up with people at university and playing guitar hero or smash bros

Arts and crafts people usually do stuff alone, I did try finding a club of some sorts but all I can find are one off sessions which usually cost at least ¬£40 and due to the price tag I imagine most people only come there once to do the thing and not make friends.

Before anyone suggests joining a sports club - I always hated sports, especially competitive stuff. I'd love to hear ideas for making friends swimming or walking as those are the two things that I do like. Which also brings me to...

**Hiking clubs**

I did look into this, and I'll admit I haven't really tried it properly. I want to (the one that seems somewhat appealing is Metropolitan Walkers) but quite demotivated by the other attempts and usually because the groups are either aimed at old people, or they're very far away which makes me not want to go because of the desire to make local friends. They also tend to have membership fees - can anyone educate me on why? The outside is free!

I did go on ONE walk locally and it was the most awkward experience ever. I showed up a little late but the organiser shared the location, I found the group but they were moving incredibly slowly and no one was talking to each other so it just felt very odd and I left, still confused on what's the point of meeting as a group if you'll just walk in silence

**Other local community clubs**

I looked at every local community club and everything is aimed at seniors or parents with little children. Movie clubs? Oh fun! Too bad, it's at 2pm on Monday. Other options include yoga and zumba, neither of which I'm interested in nor I want to pay the fee for

[**Meetup.com**](http://Meetup.com)

Anytime I check it it only has drinking and networking events (the last thing I want to do when I'm not working is more corporate yapping), maybe some walks and language exchange groups (see Hiking clubs). Nextdoor app has an events tab and has the same stuff + people asking for electrician recommendations

**Dedicated meet new people organizations**

This is the one I looked into the most because if you come to these events you want to make friends, right? RIGHT? First of all, all of them seem to be cash grabs. Stuff like London Lonely Girls Club and The Offline Club all events want money. Some make sense if it's an actual expense per person, but why does going on a walk cost ¬£1? Why is reading in silence ¬£12? I get there's some platform fees but they can't be that high and surely you can add them to the other paid events? The Offline Club seemed like such a lovely idea but they introduced memberships and merch I just can't take them seriously anymore. Kind Girls Club charges you money to give you an invite to a discord server I didn't even bother with that

I did attend one London Lonely Girls Club event, a picnic. It was ok, there were lots of people so everyone just joined a group with someone sitting next to them. My group ended up disintegrating a bit so I mostly spoke to one girl and thought we got on well, exchanged numbers etc. She was going to America for a month so I messaged her after to catch up, she wanted to meet up for coffee and when I asked when just got ghosted. I do wonder if anyone else walks out of these events with a real connection and how frequent is that

In general I find that people that attend these events are either looking for drinking buddies, or they have 0 social skills and even though you can tell they're lonely, asking them questions ends up with one sentence answers and no conversation. Same with friend making apps

**Bumble BFF**

I met my boyfriend on bumble and tbh met a fair few decent guys on there but obviously not friends with them cause it's weird so I thought finding friends there would be easy. I did set my settings to women only because it felt weird having men on there, and also as a software developer I am surrounded by men and would like some girly company.

And oh god what a nightmare. If you're a man who tried dating apps - this is exactly the same trying to make friends as a woman. Barely any matches, the ones that do match either ghost immediately or after 1 or 2 messages. Most of the people there seem to have 0 personality and list the exact same interests like cafes, thrifting, picnics and pilates. Those are nice things to do yes but how do you even start a conversation about that??

I found one friend on there and she's great, interesting and we talk almost every day so don't end up with catch ups, problem is she's terrified of going outside so we barely meet up at all. She tends to cancel plans last minute, or if I try to do something spontaneuosly only responds the next day

**Random event groups**

This one is probably the most successful attempt, I joined a few discord and whatsapp servers where people just organize things. It's ok for the most part, most of the events are drinking get togethers though. Other half is very cultural events like museums and old films that I'm not really into. They're nice people but we just don't have much in common so I don't go out with them much

I try joining the bumble plans but no one talks in those groups, it's mostly chats with 20 people and no one is actually organising anything, or if someone tries no one responds to it

**Creating my own events**

I have had a few ideas. I think it would be fun to have a crochet club, but venues cost money and I wouldn't want to charge for something like this and I'm not sure if people would join. I also don't know how to advertise it or run it when it happens, and definitely don't have enough energy to run it as a regular thing.

I suggested a few events in the event groups but people were either uninterested or turned it into something I was no longer interested in. I made a few events in the bumble plans tab but no one is joining or talking, same as other groups I've seen on there

**Distance is a problem**

I feel like for the most part it's really difficult to do anything in London because everyone is SO FAR AWAY. All the options I mentioned have this issue - if you do manage to meet someone there, they probably live at least 30min away from you and you'll only end up seeing each other once a month at most. Bumble is a supposed to be distance based but everyone is still 2 miles away and I haven't found any solutions for meeting people locally except local clubs for which I already expressed my problems with.

I considered creating my own platform for that but that's time and effort which I don't have and it's a massive risk in terms of ""will people actually use it"". Until someone gives me a solution to ""here's how you can meet home goblins who want to go out and live 20min away"" I created a discord server to trial it in London [https://discord.gg/HnjS8VBSu9](https://discord.gg/HnjS8VBSu9) and would really appreaciate people's thoughts on this and everything that I said

**Final thoughts**

I recognise that I sound miserable, that's because I am. I definitely have a narrow window of things that I like doing but I feel like that applies to most people. I tend to not go to things because I can tell I won't like them, but at the same time if I haven't tried something completely foreign to me I always say yes to it, especially if someone I like introduces me to it. I love spending time with people I like even if the thing we're doing is not my favourite I'll still tag along but it's not the same going to do things you won't enjoy with people you don't know

There is also the whole compound effect where the more you do something and fail, another time you have less hope and patience for it. I do gets spurs of energy when I retry something even if it didn't work before but then fail again and we're back at square one and I'm just tired

I just want to know if I really am alone in this and I'm just a boring person, or if there are people out there just like me but you don't see them because they're in the same exact situation (I know I'm not alone, but the people who I did meet who are like that are on the other side of the world so that's not ideal)

1k8g3v8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k8g3v8/is_the_keurig_k1500_coffee_maker_worth_it_a/,Is the Keurig K1500 Coffee Maker Worth It? A Detailed Review Awaits!,"The Keurig K1500 Commercial Coffee Maker, model K1500, has been a surprising addition to my daily coffee routine. I work in a small office, and getting good coffee without the hassle of trips to the caf√© has always been a challenge. With this machine sitting comfortably in our break room, I can confidently say it has become a game-changer. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs perfect, but there‚Äôs definitely a lot to love about it.

**Sleek and Functional Design**  
The coffee maker‚Äôs design aligns perfectly with its purpose‚Äîcompact yet professional-looking. Sporting a clean black finish, it blends effortlessly with most office or kitchen settings. I appreciate the dimensions (10.3""D x 12.4""W x 12.1""H) that strike a balance between fitting neatly into a tight space while still being robust. Beyond aesthetics, the 96 oz. water reservoir is big enough to keep me‚Äîand my colleagues‚Äîcaffeinated for hours without needing constant refills. This is an absolute win during hectic workdays.  

**Advantages**  
- Quiet Brew Technology ensures minimal disturbance when brewing.  
- The four cup sizes (6, 8, 10, and 12 oz.) allow flexibility based on individual preferences.  
- Large 96 oz. water reservoir simplifies refills and cleaning routines.  

[See Keurig K1500 Commercial Coffee Maker deals on Amazon now.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07m67x3gn/)

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
Using this coffee maker has taught me one thing‚Äîquick and reliable brewing matters. The STRONG button is a godsend for coffee lovers like me who need an extra kick in the morning. Pressing it does deliver a noticeable difference in the coffee‚Äôs intensity and flavor depth. If you enjoy mild brews or tea, this machine accommodates that too with over 30 brands and 150+ K-Cup pod varieties. It‚Äôs great knowing I can effortlessly switch between coffee, tea, or even hot cocoa depending on my mood.  

That said, it‚Äôs fully automated, and the button interface is simple to understand. I never needed to fumble with settings or consult a manual after the first use. Anyone in my office can operate it‚Äîa definite perk.

**Boons**  
- Compatibility with a wide range of K-Cup pod varieties enhances beverage diversity.  
- The STRONG button is genuinely effective in boosting coffee flavor.  
- Straightforward operation with intuitive button input.  

**Negatives**  
Nobody‚Äôs perfect, and neither is this coffee maker. The reusable filter type is a great eco-friendly option, but cleanup can get slightly tedious after frequent use. Another downside is the 10.2-pound weight. While not overly heavy, it‚Äôs inconvenient if there‚Äôs a need to move it around often, say for cleaning the countertop.  

- Reusable filter may increase cleanup time.  
- Weight makes it less portable than smaller home brewers.  
- Some pods may not be fully compatible, depending on brands.  

**Other Options**  
It‚Äôs only fair to size the Keurig K1500 up against competitors. One big name in the field is the Nespresso VertuoLine. Compared to the K1500, Nespresso boasts better espresso shots and crema, thanks to its brewing technology. But the Keurig‚Äôs diverse pod compatibility gives an edge for variety-seekers. Another contender is the Cuisinart SS-10, which excels with its stainless steel finish and built-in filters for water quality. However, the Keurig is far quieter, meaning less noise in shared office spaces.  

To sum it up, the K1500 shines in its functionality and adaptability, but it‚Äôs clear it focuses more on straightforward coffee convenience rather than specialized brewing techniques.

**Cost Efficiency**  
When assessing the price performance of this product, it‚Äôs worth noting that its features line up well with its intended audience‚Äîsmall businesses or busy households. While you might find cheaper single-serve brewers, many lack the reservoir size or the noise-reducing Quiet Brew Technology. For anyone searching for reliability, this machine feels like a good tradeoff between quality and affordability.

1k8g2be,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1k8g2be/wait_wait_plate_of_fries/,"‚ÄúWait, Wait! Plate of Fries?!‚Äù","Think back on all your drinks dates‚Ä¶.how long did they last on average? About an hour, right, give or take? Maybe a lot more. You had a drink, then another, sat and talked and talked and it‚Äôs getting on 90 minutes and now you‚Äôre getting hungry so you say this has been nice, but you are getting to leave to get dinner on and‚Ä¶y‚Äôall know this one!‚Ä¶‚ÄúWait! Wait! Plate of Fries?!‚Äù. 

Ah yes, The Plate of Fries. Not a true meal, but just *something* to snag more of your valuable time. 

Initially, you accepted his invite to ‚Äúgrab a drink‚Äù. You say you did this because you ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to be stuck there having to have dinner if I‚Äôm not into it‚Äù. 

Bet most of you are far too polite to simply leave a date after 30 minutes because you aren‚Äôt feeling it. Unless he does something egregious/unsafe (in which case, I don‚Äôt care if he took you to The Plaza for high tea, you have the right to leave), you stay the hour because you‚Äôre a nice gal, don‚Äôt wanna hurt anyone! And how long do you get for lunch at work? About an hour? And you manage a meal in that time, do you not? So why aren‚Äôt you having lunch or dinner with that drink? 

If coffee suddenly became a luxury item and shot up to $20 a cup and a decent plate of food was $2‚Ä¶..guess what kind of dates we‚Äôd suddenly have ‚Äútime‚Äù for? After all, *he‚Äôs* rarely leaving your date in under an hour too (more on that in a bit). 

Because, be honest, it‚Äôs not *really* about the time and ‚Äúwanting to get out of there if I need to‚Äù, is it? It‚Äôs about discomfort over a man spending money on you, residue‚Ä¶from times when men made you feel guilty. 

Do men ever feel like they ‚Äúowe‚Äù? How many men do you know happily accepted your offer of casual sex (or sought it out before even meeting you), and then felt they ‚Äúowed‚Äù you a nice date, a nice gift, an emotional investment, the things *you* value? Give me a break. More like, ‚ÄúSo when is next time?‚Äù

Point there is, while you can‚Äôt move through the world like a man in *all* aspects, you can in this one‚Ä¶.*accept gifts graciously and guiltlessly while never feeling like you owe*. If you feel afraid of him, I get it, men can intimidating, but try to relax. If you met him on an app or randomly out (you probably did), damn well make sure he does not yet have your real number (use Google Voice and explain later if you get serious), last name, social media, or address. If you have mutuals, trust me, if he even bothers to bitch to them about how he paid for dinner and you didn‚Äôt touch his body or accept a second date, sensible people aren‚Äôt going to give this guy a shoulder to cry on.

But before you came to terms with all *that*, you did a drinks date, you got hungry and‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúWait, stay longer! Plate of Fries?!‚Äù

Ideally, in his mind you‚Äôd just sit there and talk and talk and talk for free while he works on ‚Äúbreaking the touch barrier‚Äù (well *ideally* you‚Äôd go back to his place, his comfort zone, to provide free sex. ‚ÄúIt was a gift! She offered, I accepted!‚Äù). But, there is some base level understanding on his part that if you are uncomfortable, you will leave the date. 

So, you may hear some variation of ‚ÄúPlate of fries?‚Äù ‚ÄúSplit some fried zucchini?‚Äù Or the vague ‚ÄúWe could order something!‚Äù And what is ‚Äúsomething‚Äù? Generally, a split appetizer. The message (after you told him you need to leave to get a meal)? That entertaining him is priority over nourishing your own body.

He *could* take care of both of those desires. But no. This man knows what he is doing. He‚Äôs well aware that ‚Äúsplitting an appetizer‚Äù does not demonstrate care, the way a proper entree that hits your macros would. What he cares about is more of your time for himself, for as cheaply as possible. 

If it‚Äôs never sat well with you, that he simply did not ask to be sat by a server to transition to dinner for the next hour (or however much more of your attention you‚Äôll give him), which there is *clearly* time for, it‚Äôs a little thing called ‚Äúyour intuition‚Äù.

We all know men get lonely. Look at their ‚Äúmy love language‚Äù prompt answers. ‚ÄúPhysical touch‚Äù. They want to be touched. They want to touch you. They crave it. And they feel like a loser if it‚Äôs been a while since a date. And your intuition (and lived experience) informs you that a man will absolutely waste time with a woman he knows ain‚Äôt it, in the hopes of touching and kissing and feeling wanted. He would rather have that extra however-much-time-you‚Äôll-give-him and maybe have some sort of intimate physical contact, than go back to sit on his couch to jerk off.

But not enough to invite you to a proper meal! And you know full well that for nearly every red-blooded male there is *that woman* who just *does* it for him. That he‚Äôs eager to impress. ‚ÄúHER, I want HER.‚Äù And this woman, he will take her to dinner, and there will be no talk of ‚Äúordering an appetizer‚Äù. This is someone he will properly care for, not offer a few bites of the cheapest fried garbage or like, two oysters and a handful of salted almonds if he‚Äôs feeling fancy. Men know moving to dinner for more of your time is the *intentional* move, but in that moment he is saying ‚ÄúBut not for you‚Äù, and you know in that moment you are not *that* woman for him. 

And it stings, yes. But a man not being into you is not the real problem. That is his right. The problem- the thing that really grinds your gears- is that because he does not see you as his ‚ÄúHER‚Äù, he therefore thinks your time is not valuable. And instead of just politely letting you go after that drink he offered and not seeing you again, he is trying to hustle you.

When he does not see you as ‚Äúinvestable‚Äù, of demonstrating serious intent towards, it doesn‚Äôt mean you are not *useful*. So he may test to see if your self-esteem is low enough that you will accept seeing yourself that way too. A woman who accepts bare minimum is a woman who is easier to control.  It‚Äôs fucking disrespectful of your time and you know it. 

Because for you, with dating men being so unsafe (and so much work!) as it is, if you are not ‚Äúdinner worthy‚Äù, what‚Äôs the point? A man you ain‚Äôt it for values time with you less, values your feelings less, offers the bare minimum to keep you servicing him, and you know in your gut will therefore not treat you as well as the woman who *does* it for him. That can be very risky in terms of sexual and emotional harm. 

This is a standard issue strategy that lonely men use to fuck around with women they‚Äôre not that into‚Ä¶that many of you are familiar with. 

Ideally you‚Äôll be off of the drinks dates. But I‚Äôll give you ladies some grace on your ‚Äúdrink date‚Äù if it‚Äôs a damn fine cocktail on his dime at a classy place and is on the way home from work or something, not out of your way to go to. *And* if you‚Äôre like me and anywhere you go to dinner pre-commitment from him is going to be an investment (love to take me to some ‚Äúhole in the wall‚Äù sometime? take me after you‚Äôve made things exclusive with me). But after ONE drink only, I don‚Äôt care how cute he is, you get up and say it‚Äôs dinner time, bye. If offering a proper dinner to a hungry date is not the first thing out of his mouth (*or* ‚Äúthank you, it was lovely‚Äù because he‚Äôs not into you), if he starts tire kicking with talks of splitting this or that app? Then he doesn‚Äôt value you or your time, but is happy to exploit it for a little more attention (and hopefully more!). It won‚Äôt get better, block and delete. 

Yes he‚Äôll be annoyed when you tell him you actually need to fix yourself a *proper* plate as a matter of self-care (care in the form of a nourished body being something he cannot be bothered to do, despite very much wanting *access* to that same body). Who cares if he‚Äôs annoyed? It‚Äôs called entitlement, this idea that you were supposed to clear your entire evening for ‚Äúgrab a drink‚Äù, just in case he thought you were worth an additional couple potato skins. And if he doesn‚Äôt respect you prioritizing your body‚Äôs health over his pleasure, he won‚Äôt when you do it with your body‚Äôs safety either. 

Your gut knows when you‚Äôre hungry and when you‚Äôre being devalued. It knows the care your body and soul need. Honor both. ",2,1745682678.0,WomenDatingOverForty,0,0.75,False

it was horrible, because i love him so so much. a few days later, i asked if he wanted to meet for a coffee. we had a fun time and before he went home, he said that he doesn't know if he made the right choice regarding the breakup. i told him that i want this relationsship and that i want to support him through his issues and help him get back on his feet. i realised that i made some mistakes in the past and want to built a new and stronger relationship with him, where we handle conflicts differently. 

he said that he needed more time to think about everything. a day later i went partying with my friend, to distract myself from the whole situation. i drank quite a lot and at the end of the night one bartender started kissing me. i kissed him back at first, because i didn't understand what was going on but when i realised, i was disgusted and told him to leave. my ex and i are still officialy seperated, but i feel so guilty for what happened. i just don't know how to handle the situation now. i love him so much and i hope that we can come back together, but now i'm scared that this destroyed everything.

TL;DR: my boyfriend broke up with me, but told me a few days later that he doesn't know if he made the right choice. he needs time to think about everything. a man kissed me on a party, i was very drunk and i didn't want that kiss. i kissed back for a few seconds before i realised what was happening. i feel guilty.",2,1745682274.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

Like maintaining the software build.  Picture a large application with lots of COM objects, lots of Interface Definition Language, and lots of code.  And a lax attitude to architecture, coupling etc.  

Build turnaround time: 6 weeks.  Did I mention the build was in a BAT file that crapped out on the first error?  Or that they were using SourceSafe for version control?  Or that nobody seemed to give a damn?  

So, first a Makefile.  Microsoft actually had a version of Make I could use.  No more aborting at a single error.  Proper dependencies defined etc.

Next: sort out the architectural problems.  People liked to look across the software and grab any interface or definition they liked.  Result: cross referencing where A and B reference each other, so each has to be built before the other.  This was the major source of errors.  But you can compile the IDL separately from the code, so a few tweaks fixed that.  Builds started running without error every time.

Stuck inside on a rainy day with warm coffee and some blankets and some music. Finally actually able to hear the rain hitting newly formed leaves on the trees this spring season. Reading and catching up on shows. Thought chatting with some of you fine folks would be a great idea.
 
I'm up for conversation of all types, chit chat, small talk, real talk, deep inquiries, and of course I'm a pretty good ear for those who need to vent or just need to get something of your chest.

We could have similar or different interests but just to give you an idea of mine, I enjoy being outside and camping and hiking, I read a lot, watch some TV and movies, all that mostly in the sci-fi, fantasy, and horror genres. I also read and collect comics and some manga. And yes I do watch some anime though most of it I do not like. Also enjoy listening to pretty much every kind of music and even try to play some instruments. Also enjoy history and learning about local lore and legends from all over the world. I'll stop this here because it definitely looks like it's getting long but if you feel like some conversation throughout the day or just an occasional check in, feel free to drop me a line! Hope to talk to some of you soon!

The pattern on the back of the puck screen is very similar to the shower screen, and I wasn‚Äôt expecting such thick and rigid material. I was expecting more of a mesh for the puck screen. I have zero experience with puck screens.

1) is it superfluous or redundant to use the puck screen with similar pattern as the shower screen?

2) if it happens to you that the puck screen gets stuck to the puck, what‚Äôs your technique for separating them? In my case the screen is stuck to the puck almost every time. Puck is hot lol.

I am explaining how tariffs work  in the US and how they could be used to strengthen the economy. Also, retaliatory tariffs.","Tariffs are taxes imposed by a government on imported goods, which increase the cost of those goods for consumers. They are used to protect domestic industries by making foreign products more expensive, thereby encouraging consumers to buy locally made items instead. 

However, if a country doesn‚Äôt produce that item say coffee then it just increases the cost with no alternative. 

The US imports majority of its goods and doesn‚Äôt export as much as it imports. So if another country places a tariff on US goods it makes the US export more expensive to their consumers and if that country does have an alternative for consumers for that item say for automobiles then it also hurts the US because they can just buy the alternative. 

The US doesn‚Äôt have many exports that are only found in the US. If we wanted to strengthen the economy using tariffs we would have needed to have the manufacturing processes already in place to encourage US consumers to buy American.

While his regime inflicts inhumane conditions on migrants and consolidates power through widespread land grabs, his coffee venture‚ÄîBean of Fire‚Äîis nothing more than a sophisticated image-laundering scheme.

According to a revealing report by the \[Miami New Times\](https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/president-of-el-salvadors-weird-coffee-company-is-based-in-miami-22880229) , Bean of Fire operates via a Miami-based LLC called Hacienda Dorada. This setup not only casts serious doubts on the transparency of the operation but also serves as a financial vehicle for Bukele‚Äôs increasingly unaccountable wealth accumulation.

In an effort to distract from his oppressive domestic policies, Bukele launched Bean of Fire as a premium coffee brand. \[CentralAmerica.com\](https://www.centralamerica.com/experiencing/drinking/el-salvador-president-coffee-brand-bean-of-fire/)  exposes how the brand is pitched as a tribute to El Salvador‚Äôs rich coffee heritage. However, critics argue that this venture is designed to gloss over his regime‚Äôs ruthless treatment of vulnerable migrant communities while projecting a sanitized, market-friendly image to the world.

Furthermore, investigative work by \[El Salvador Now\](https://www.elsalvadornow.org/2024/09/20/bukele-associates-the-new-landowning-family-of-el-salvador-bukele-cia-la-nueva-familia-terrateniente-de-el-salvador/)  reveals that Bukele and his inner circle have been aggressively acquiring land assets, including the coffee farms used for Bean of Fire. This strategic land grab not only bolsters his economic power but also underscores how his business interests are inseparably linked with a broader pattern of autocratic control and exploitation.

Consumers must be aware: supporting Bean of Fire means endorsing a brand intricately tied to an oppressive regime that profits off misery while distracting from its heinous policies. The coffee market should not serve as a smokescreen for tyrants. Stand up, demand accountability, and join the boycott against Bean of Fire.

**Background**:  I have never been a great sleeper.  Anytime I have something important going on the next day, I tend to toss and turn, even as a child.  I am now 38 and it seems to be getting worse.  I want to get 7-8 hours of sleep a night as I definitely feel better after that.

**Current situation:**  I think this is some sort of anxiety or stress issue.  If I do not have any tasks I am trying to get done tomorrow morning, I am able to sleep in or get a full nights sleep.  For example, last week I was on vacation, no ""to do"" list and able to get 8-9+ hours of sleep.  Unfortunately if I have anything on my plate to do in the morning, even if its a trivial as various small tasks at home or weigh myself for my diet plan, I tend to get up a few times in the night and check the time and then get up usually 30 to 60 mins before my alarm.  Like I am excited or stressed to get up and do the work.  This happens whether its work I do or do not want to do.  I think some level I can't relax with a ""to-do"" list.

I am also a very light sleeper, hear all noises etc.  Interestingly, I can usually fall right asleep, its just the sleeping 7-8 hours that is a problem.  My typical schedule is get in bed by 9, fall asleep by 930, have alarm set for 4 am but often get up at 3 am-ish.  I wanted to get alot done today, I went to bed at 9 last night and was up at 130 am.  This is not atypical 1x a week with a big ""to-do"" list day.

**Additional info:**  I am working out 6-7 days a week for 45 mins.  I do drink 5-8 cups of coffee a day (less on adderral days). I do take adderral occassionally (targeting 2-3 days a week).  I did not take it on vacation so maybe that helped me sleep better but i think its the ""to do list"" hanging over my head.  I am also on a SSRI.  I am rarely drinking currently.

**Ideas:**  I am considering picking days that I just tell myself I am not doing any work in the AM but this does not seem sustainable to me to meet the requirements I have in life.

In Queer + Sober‚Äôs infancy I used Facebook and Instagram heavily to promote our meetups. Eventbrite has become an incredible resource as well. In my neighborhood local apps like Nextdoor tend to lean a bit older demographic wise, but your area might have similar forums that would be worth trying out.

Once you‚Äôre able to gather a few other people, then you can brainstorm activities together. I also recommend bringing a friend to your first couple of events. The first few meetups I hosted were unattended, and it wasn‚Äôt until I selected a coffee shop that was in a more ideal location that our group grew.

Others may want to consider meeting consistently like this at first as well (monthly at the same place, same time) before considering popping up at other locations.

Running a Shopify store is 10% selling cool stuff and 90% hoping your spreadsheets are less wrong than usual.
I used to think I had a decent handle on my numbers ‚Äî until I realized ""revenue"" and ""profit"" are two very different things.

So I gave TrueProfit a try.
Mostly because I was tired of doing detective work every time I wanted to know if I could afford an extra coffee this month.

**What surprised me:**

* **Real-time dashboard** ‚Äì not just revenue, but actual net profit after ads, shipping, transaction fees, refunds, and the inevitable ""oops"" expenses

* **Detailed product breakdown** ‚Äì found out two of my best-selling products were basically charity projects

* **Customer LTV tracking** ‚Äì finally saw which ads actually made sense to keep running

* **One dashboard to rule them all** ‚Äì no more logging into 7 different apps to figure out if I'm broke or rich


**Small downside:**

* Setup isn't hard, but connecting all your ad accounts and apps is a bit of a chore (worth it though)

If you‚Äôre making like 3 sales a month, the $35+ monthly price might feel like overkill. (But if you're scaling, it‚Äôs a no-brainer.)



---

**Quick personal story:**
About two weeks after setting up TrueProfit, I spotted a weird trend ‚Äî one product had solid sales volume, killer reviews, customers loved it...
...and it was secretly bleeding $4 in losses per sale because of insane return rates I hadn‚Äôt factored into my manual spreadsheets.

**Killed the product in 24 hours.**
Shifted ad budget to a different item with better margins.
Result?
**Net profit went up 18% that month.**
No magic, no crazy growth hacks ‚Äî just... actually knowing my real numbers.

I honestly wish I‚Äôd installed something like this six months earlier.
Would‚Äôve saved me enough to buy at least 17 celebratory pizzas.

1k8fknv,https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT/comments/1k8fknv/hobby_3d_modeler_looking_for_experience_in_an/,[Hobby] 3D modeler looking for experience in an indie game dev studio/team + rant,"I started doing 3D art about 1.5-2 years ago, looking to transition into the 3D industry somewhere down the line (films, games, doesn't matter really, but I do see myself leaning more towards games). I'm looking for experience in an indie game dev team/studio to work mainly as a junior 3D modeler. The studio/team has to have a website/LinkedIn, so I can say ""Yes this is the \[indie game studio name\]'s website/LinkedIn that I've put in my CV, and no they're not totally made-up and nowhere to be found on the internet."" Putting someone's reddit handle in a CV is a no-no for obvious reasons.

Here's a great example of such a studio:

[https://www.seriouspointgames.com/wex](https://www.seriouspointgames.com/wex)

I'm willing to work for free (part-time). The team also has to have an experienced 3D modeler/artist who'd literally just off-load some of his own work to me (basic 3D modeling in Maya, UVing, sculpting in ZBrush, some basic handpainting etc). Compensation for my work will be a guarantee of some sort (signed document) that I'm going to be in the credits of the game I'd be involved in. Currently, I find the prospect of putting a shipped game on my ArtStation portfolio very appealing.

Here's my ArtStation - [https://www.artstation.com/harisp](https://www.artstation.com/harisp)

I'm currently working on 3 more portfolio pieces (2 full body characters and a stylized stone tower) to update my portfolio with, hopefully soon.

Now for the rant part. And I'm sure it's going to rub a lot of people on this subreddit the wrong way, and, frankly, it's supposed to.

First thing's first - this subreddit is full of people with exploitative intentions. That's a fact. I personally have never and could never ask somebody to work for free for ME, on MY passion project. It's just indecent, and wrong. Collaboration, 2+ people getting together, in-person, cam, discord, doesn't matter, sure - brain-storming ideas, and finally settling on a shared concept/idea that everyone's more or less passionate about - that could work, and I'm sure a lot of valuable creative stuff was made this way.

And I actually can think of an example where it would be justifiable to work for free - if let's say Blizzard, Rockstar, Bethesda contacted me to work for free for them (as some kind of a 2D/3D artist let's say), remotely, for a year, I'd definitely take it, because imagine being able to put that on your CV. It's a guarantee to open many doors in the future. Plus, you'd get some pretty good experience and actually learn from industry professionals and learn how to work and manage in industry-established game dev pipelines. And there's a chance too, if you prove yourself good enough that they actually offer you a paid job. Sure you'd have to dig into your savings/ borrow money/ get an additional part-time paid job to carry it all out, but at the end of it all - that unpaid work would actually pay off. You're asked to work for free anyway, might as well choose a big-shot established studio that's been around for decades, right?

Or even working part-time for a smaller indie game dev team/studio like I wrote above, as long as they're trying to look presentable online (website, LinkedIn), even if they haven't released any game. I'd take that any day of the week over some fantasy revenue sharing pipe dreams.

But then let's take a look at the majority of posts on this subreddit asking people to work for free. In 90% of this subreddit's posts is a person, in most cases an amateur, with an already formed, PERSONAL, game idea/concept, waltzing in with the now customary ""I'm making a game like the x or y game (that made a lot of money btw), and asking, blatantly and unapologetically for people to volunteer to make it for them. For free. I have yet to see ONE post on here with somebody offering something like a symbolic compensation (let's say 50$ a month, for some coffee?) just so people know they're not being exploited. And if you can't or won't pay your programmer, 2D/3D artist etc. only 50$ a month - I'm sorry, but you don't deserve to be making a game in the first place, and honestly - I hope you never do. Because you do have a paying job - you just choose not to pay a single dollar for hours and hours of work other people are putting into YOUR game.

That's why the \[RevShare\] tag in this subreddit is just a catchphrase by now - just so they could pitch their idea of you working ""passionately"", for free, on THEIR own project, easier. In most posts with the \[RevShare\] tag there isn't even the slightest mention of it, yet alone a full, comprehensive revenue sharing plan (maybe even a contract?) completely laid out in the post before people who actually might be motivated by a prospect of being compensated that way actually sign up. Or we can go even further - why not draft a contract? Just today I saw a person on this subreddit stating you're required to sign an NDA before joining - why not sign a revenue sharing contract of some kind, so I have a guarantee that if the game makes a profit, I'll be fairly compensated?

And let's say that, by divine intervention, the game actually ends up getting released, and it does good on Steam and hits, let's say, 100k+ sales. What guarantee do the people who worked for free on it have that they'll be compensated fairly? None. Because everyone posting here needing a team for their projects are intentionally being vague about it.

So please, decent human beings on this subreddit, do not waste your time working for free for scummy people with pipe-dreams of getting rich fast. It sets a very, very bad precedent.

And an honest question at the very end - how many games, who's teams were formed specifically on this subreddit, have actually got to a point where a game was released and a revenue sharing plan carried out, and the profits split fairly? Because let's just all be honest here for a second - it's good to be passionate about stuff, but it's better when you get paid for it too.",1,1745681376.0,INAT,0,1.0,False

Running a Shopify store is 10% selling cool stuff and 90% hoping your spreadsheets are less wrong than usual.
I used to think I had a decent handle on my numbers ‚Äî until I realized ""revenue"" and ""profit"" are two very different things.

So I gave TrueProfit a try.
Mostly because I was tired of doing detective work every time I wanted to know if I could afford an extra coffee this month.

**What surprised me:**

* **Real-time dashboard** ‚Äì not just revenue, but actual net profit after ads, shipping, transaction fees, refunds, and the inevitable ""oops"" expenses

* **Detailed product breakdown** ‚Äì found out two of my best-selling products were basically charity projects

* **Customer LTV tracking** ‚Äì finally saw which ads actually made sense to keep running

* **One dashboard to rule them all** ‚Äì no more logging into 7 different apps to figure out if I'm broke or rich


**Small downside:**

* Setup isn't hard, but connecting all your ad accounts and apps is a bit of a chore (worth it though)

If you‚Äôre making like 3 sales a month, the $35+ monthly price might feel like overkill. (But if you're scaling, it‚Äôs a no-brainer.)



---

**Quick personal story:**
About two weeks after setting up TrueProfit, I spotted a weird trend ‚Äî one product had solid sales volume, killer reviews, customers loved it...
...and it was secretly bleeding $4 in losses per sale because of insane return rates I hadn‚Äôt factored into my manual spreadsheets.

**Killed the product in 24 hours.**
Shifted ad budget to a different item with better margins.
Result?
**Net profit went up 18% that month.**
No magic, no crazy growth hacks ‚Äî just... actually knowing my real numbers.

I honestly wish I‚Äôd installed something like this six months earlier.
Would‚Äôve saved me enough to buy at least 17 celebratory pizzas.

When I was in my late teens and early twenties, I suffered from social anxiety. This showed up as extreme shyness and socially awkward behavior, which I was very self-conscious about. I also have a minor speech impediment. For example, it took me a lot of effort just to send a message to someone I thought I could be friends with because I was afraid I‚Äôd word it in a way that would confirm I was ‚Äúweird‚Äù‚Äîwhen in reality, I was just a normal guy struggling mentally. As a result, I found myself socially isolated again and again‚Äîfirst in high school (a few friends) and then in my early university years (no friends :\[ ). This led to depression, prolonged my studies, and delayed my professional life.

My biggest achievement in life is that I overcame it (!). It took a terrible amount of effort and pain‚Äîself-exposure, relapses (COVID didn‚Äôt help and i even lost one of my few cherished friendships to a particularly cruel case of cancer), I also spent years on medication for depression. But nowadays, I have no problem going to a party (though not alone), asking someone out for a beer or coffee, or just being around people I don‚Äôt know.

The issue is‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know how to talk about my past with new people. For example, a co-worket went to the same school I did, and our time there overlapped. He finds it perplexing that he doesn‚Äôt know me or that I don‚Äôt know someone he mentions.

As they say, the minstrelcels fear the jesterchads, and everyone is rushing to emulate the ones portraying themselves as chisel-chinned monochrome stoics.

However, the path to jesterhood is a long one, requiring years of being the butt of every joke. It would be simply untrue to state that I can teach greenhorns all the ropes in a simple guide, so this guide will focus on a foundational skill on a clown repertoire: speaking in rhymes. Obviously, a real good buffoon is a wit and can create entirely original lines on the fly. This enchiridion is meant for the less experienced jesters.

The go-to beginner strategy to talk in rhymes is to have a long list of phrases that end in each common phoneme but don't contribute in any significant way to the meaning of the sentence. Thus, when you want to say something, take note of the last phoneme in the sentence, and recall a preliminary sentence on your long list of phrase to precede it.

For instance, suppose you want to say ""I'm sorry for your loss"" to your grieving friend while keeping your whimsy. In the category of phrases ending in ""oss"" you remember ""Sharing needles is gross"", thus forming the following verses:



>Sharing needles is gross,

>Sorry for your loss



This method is better than memorizing full verses, as it gives you much more flexibility. With time you can mix up your rhymes, with multiple verse stanzas. For instance, if you want to say ""No one brewed coffee again, I don't get paid to do this"" and your mental section of quotes contains the sentences ""Damn snakes in the plane"" and ""I'm grateful for this bliss"", you combine them to obtain the following stanza:



>Damn snakes in the plane, I'm grateful for this bliss,

>No one brewed coffee again, I don't get paid to do this!

The main drawback is that you will eventually start to repeat the same sayings again and again. Some don't consider this to be a bad thing, but rather a personal flair of the jester. Nevertheless, you should refine your repertoire, removing and adding quotes as you figure out what works out and what doesn't.

If you successfully internalize the advice in this guide you will be well on your way to stack no money and get no bitches.",2,1745680796.0,redscarepod,1,0.75,False

Have you ever woken up and felt like it was going to be a great day? That‚Äôs how I felt this morning. 

I woke up a minute before my alarm, refreshed and ready to go. Usually I had trouble waking up, but this morning I felt energized. 

I got up and had a quick shower - the water stayed at exactly the right temperature the entire time. Then I got dressed - I actually felt good about how I looked in the mirror, for a change. After I had Miriam, I had trouble losing some of the baby weight and didn‚Äôt always feel good about myself. But today I felt confident, even sexy. 

I packed up Miriam‚Äôs things for daycare and got her to the car without a fuss - she didn‚Äôt even spit up on me, for once. As any single parent will tell you, that was a miracle in itself. 

On the way in, I stopped at my favorite coffee shop. They had my favorite morning coffee - a light roast breakfast blend, iced to beat the arid heat - and a ham and cheese croissant, just the way I like them. And it turns out the person ahead of me had already paid for me as part of a pay-it-forward line, and the person behind me only had a small plain black coffee. Score!

I got to the office and got a great parking space, right up near the front. Then I ran inside and got to my desk and booted up my computer a minute before my boss came by my desk. 

‚ÄúGood morning, Melanie! I see that you‚Äôre in bright and early!‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely, Mr. Jordan! Ready to make some customers happy.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great to hear! By the way, I saw the final monthly numbers this morning - *someone* led the department in customer satisfaction rate. Keep up the great work!‚Äù

*Wow*, I thought as I watched him walk back to his office. Mr. Jordan wasn‚Äôt one to hand out praise easily. That was amazing!

And the day continued on like this - all of my calls were easy, with reasonable customers and issues I could resolve. My coworkers, even the most ornery ones, didn‚Äôt give me any grief. The deli in the lobby had my favorite soup and salad and it was on sale. And on and on. 

Then five o‚Äôclock came and my shift was over. I clocked out and headed to the parking lot, glad the workday was done and I could go home and relax. 

But as I got to the car, something felt off. I looked around the car - there were no dents or scratches, so no one hit me. The tires weren‚Äôt flat. I looked inside - the front seats were fine. Then I checked the backseat. 

And realized, as I saw a tiny foot sticking out of a car seat, that I didn‚Äôt ever remember stopping at the daycare center that morning. 

*MIRIAM!!*

To all guys and girls of this sub, after year of having no matches, got a match finally and going out on a date tomorrow!!! 

This boy here bought a premium in bumble, with minimal re arrangement of profile, I got few matches, but, most of them didn't even start convo. I didn't have an option tho, but I found one girl who's putting efforts into conversation and making it as a good time and who catches my jokes and vibes without taking it for granted. 
We are both looking for long term, now I find this lady to be 75-80% of match for me. 

Anyways my date is in Banglore, any good suggestions? I don't wanna go to pubs or anything and spend toooo much on lavish restraunts. I'd rather want to have good quality time spent than to spend money on expensive cafes and bars and stuff. 
 She doesn't like it either. 
My plan is to go to small Cafe with little to less crowd, talk and have some food, and go buy some books in the bookstore, and go walk in food street something like that

Any suggestions or help would be appricited. 
This is my first time going out on a date tho

Anyways I'm genuinely happy to share this as I've been scared of the girls in this Gen and didn't even dare to make an effort. Now finally I did, got a match. My friends say she's ugly and not a match for me, but to me she's really pretty. Ik I got shitty friends. Her smile is the prettiest!! her personality is really good. Let's hope for the best.

AUGUST 30TH, 2017

TIME: 01:24PM EST

¬†

¬†

It was a totally normal day within the small county of Beach City, Delmarva. People and gems alike were going around in the sun as tourists, locals, and some gems from Little Homeworld, about five miles away from Beach City, the sun glowing rays of light onto the ground below as cars drove along the local highway in and out of Beach City, as the small town had gotten quite a lot of attention from people due to the events that happened two years earlier, the known attack of what the public officials and the people who called themselves the 'Crystal Gems' called the 'Diamonds.' The world had long known that there were signs that someone or¬†**something**¬†had been here before humans and then gone as soon as they came, leaving plenty of old tech and buildings for Earth's top scientists and countries to wrap their minds around for decades. Which obviously was until a small town in fuckoff, Delmarva suddenly became the center of attention of the entire galaxy over the course of a night. It started with a giant floating spaceship formed as an eye one day, and it escalated from there to an entire foreign species from another galaxy coming to blows with the small group of 'gems' in the town of Beach City.¬†

¬†

The aftermath was quite messy, to say the least, jurisdictionally speaking at the minimum. The local Sheriff's Office got a massive funding boost from the federal government after the formation of the sovereign state known as 'Little Homeworld' outside of Beach City and due to the heightened concentration of gems that flocked to the small town to see what Earth was like. So basically the department went from having only 4 deputies in it to suddenly being bolstered to having more than 30 deputies overnight, changing the department from an underfunded, overworked piece of jurisdictional nightmares into a more greatly sized department within the region, especially for the low population number of human inhabitants.¬†

¬†

One of these deputies, John Henderson, was driving his brand new Chevrolet Tahoe PPV, the new livery and build of the cruiser marking it as a vehicle belonging to the Beach County Sheriff's Office, the rear doors of the cruiser marked with 'CAUTION K-9' as John sat inside of the cruiser, slowly rolling around the outskirts of the town, listening to some music on the car radio, which was playing country music from a band that just wouldn't want to give up their time yet even though their prime was back in the 80s. He didn't mind it, though; the song was alright, and it drowned out the silence in his cab. The smell inside of the cruiser was a mismatched mix of dry, low-quality coffee, stale air, and a hint of wet dog from Shep, who laid in the back, sleeping soundly in the cage as John hummed quietly along to the song that was playing. He checked the clock on the center information screen. '01:26 PM,' it was barely even the time of the day, but the day felt like it was going at turtle speeds due to obvious reasons. All he had done that day was argue with a Peridot about why they couldn't attempt to plant a tree in the middle of a street. It was kind of amusing now that he thought about it, if he had to be fair with himself. He was lost in his own thoughts as the police radio inside of his cruiser suddenly sprung to life.

***""23-Kilo, Dispatch,""***¬†the radio said, the usual female voice coming through, Jennet. The local dispatcher, and to be fair, only dispatcher, called out to John as he let out a sigh, reaching for the radio attached to a magnet as he brought it up to his mouth, pressing the transmit button as he spoke into it.

¬†

***""Dispatch, 23-Kilo, Go ahead.""***¬†He responded, continuing to drive down the road as he noticed that the sky had suddenly gotten darker, causing him to furrow his brows a bit. It was really supposed to get cloudy today. Not tomorrow, not the day after, nor that. It was forecasted that it would be spotless the entire week, but just in the blink of an eye. He couldn't help but also see what looked like a silhouette above the clouds, which looked oddly bullet-like, just...pointing down at the ground. His line of thought was disrupted by the dispatch responding again.  
  
***""23-Kilo, Dispatch, Just doing a status check.""***¬†¬†The radio responded, and John couldn't help but give a slight frown on his face. It was the dispatcher's way of saying hello to someone, a bit unorthodox, but it worked most of the time. He just decided not to respond the last time as he continued driving down the road, humming quietly to himself as the dark and cloudy sky just intensified, causing some more caution from him as he furrowed his brows even more.¬†

¬†

""Looks like we're not going out any time soon, Shep."" He said quietly to the dog in the back, the canine only letting out a huff in response as John let out a chuckle. It was kind of funny to him; the dog was always so overdramatic for a German Shepherd. That's what he loved so much about Shep: he had personality.

¬†

The dark, cloudy sky suddenly began to open up to an overly pink hue in the sky as a long, no, MASSIVE, cylindrical spaceship slowly floated down towards the hill by the lighthouse, the wind noticeably picking up speed as well as John widened his eyes in slight shock. He hadn't seen something like this in all his years within the Sheriff's Office, outside of when the Diamonds came to visit the town before they got the warp pads set up in town. He watched as the spaceship floated down towards the hill, noticing a small group of people, no more than four, standing on the hill. His eyes widened even more as the ship got out three landing legs. Landing onto the hill with a slight thunder as a drill suddenly appeared out of the end of the tip, spearing into the ground like a drill as pink liquid began to flow down into the ground. He cursed quietly to himself as he grabbed his radio, tried to press the transmit button but was met with the 'CHANNEL BUSY' tone, and***""***¬†pressed the button a couple more times before finally getting through, speaking up in a serious tone as he flicked on his lights and siren, turning the cruiser around as he began to speed towards the town.

¬†

***""Dispatch, 23-Kilo, Priority, I just saw a gem ship crash into the hill beside the lighthouse. I need additional units there ASAP.""***¬†He said into the radio as he let it go, letting out a huff as he cursed once again under his breath, the siren and engine screaming louder than before as the cruiser was pushed to its limits. John could only hope that no one was hurt as he began to turn a couple of times as he reached the outskirts of the town, turning onto a dirt road that lead up to a dirt parking lot closest to the hill, which had been turned into a reserve by the Feds and Gems. The tires screeched to a halt as the cruiser's driver door was thrown open, John calling out his arrival on the radio as he practically half threw himself out of the car, rushing towards the trail up towards the scene as he could see people there. They were gems, about four of them and one human, who looked around their mid-teens. The thing that caught him off guard was that they appeared to be...fighting?¬†

¬†

He furrowed his brows but continued to run towards the scene. He yelled out as he saw a pink gem figure sway what looked like a pink scythe around, the blade glowing a light pink as it sliced through the gems. ""HEY! SHERIFF'S OFFICE! HEY!"" He yelled out multiple times as the gems it attacked poofed into clouds of dust, the human being the only one left as they appeared to be really frightened. John was just about 50 feet away when he drew his service pistol, a PSA 5.7 ROCK, an uncommon choice, but it had the caliber needed to pierce armor, and in this case, gem forms. He pulled it out and pointed it towards the pink gem figure as it just managed to slice the human figure clean in two...clean in two. The top and bottom body of the teen flopped onto the ground, not a scream, not a yell, but a grunt, a wet crunch, a pop... John quickly opened fire on the pink gem figure, which seemed to be turning its head towards John now. He fired one, two, three, four, five, and six times. He stopped counting after the seventh; he just continued firing until the figure was nothing more than a poof of smoke, the gem of the figure landing onto the ground with a soft thump. He quickly reached for his radio as he called out,¬†***""DISPATCH, 23-ADAM, GIVE ME THE PATCH, SHOTS FIRED, SHOTS FIRED, I NEED ADDITIONALS HERE NOW, WE GOT MULTIPLE CIVILIANS DOWN, START ME RESCUE.""***¬†He barked into the radio as he rushed towards the human on the ground, knowing that gems would just reform after poofing. Humans, on the other hand? Not so much. He reached the kid on the ground as he kept an eye on the poofed gem as he crouched beside the kid, cursing multiple times as he tried to check for a pulse and check for any signs of life, but there were none. The parts of the internal body was practically peaking out of the kid as he cursed out loudly, standing up as he looked around and at the gem drill thing, cursing loudly once more as sirens continued in the background, a distant flying figure slowly approaching in the distance as John could only think one thing: 'What the everliving fuck just happened...and what was going to happen now...'",1,1745680523.0,stevenuniverse,1,1.0,False
1k8f8z2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8f8z2,Changes in caffeine metabolism after supplementing?,"36f

I drink the same amount of coffee every day and have been for four months, since I got divorced and no longer split a pot with someone.

I buy the same beans, fill my silly little grinder (short term rental) the same amount, pulse it the same number of times, and fill the French press the same amount.

The last couple weeks, I have had a much harder time falling asleep, my lowest resting heart rate has been up 5-10bpm, my HRV has tanked, and my resilience score on Oura has been in a free fall.

I initially thought it might be seasonal allergies or something with supplementation, so I‚Äôve been tweaking that. Antihistamine made no difference, and neither did taking days off from my stack. I thought I might be overmethylated. 

In mid-March, I started supplementing B vitamins, TMG, and D3/K2 and had a ton of improvement in focus, sleep, and cardio metrics. I added trace minerals a few weeks later, mostly for the zinc, molybdenum, and iodine.
- Thorne Riboflavin 5'-Phosphate (36.5 mg)
- Thorne Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphate (33.8 mg)
- Pure Encapsulations Adenosyl/Hydroxy B12 (500 mcg @ 60s)
- TMG (750 mg)
- Thorne D3 (50 mcg) / K2 (400 mcg)
- Pure Encapsulations Trace Minerals

I tried supplementing Magnesium Glycinate for the second time, and it gave me crazy anxiety, again. I am recovering from a panic disorder and tipped me right back into being in a bad place.

I‚Äôve had issues with fat absorption / undigested food, and my general digestion has not been great since my divorce, so I started taking:
- Designs for Health GI Revive (7 capsules in the morning before food)
- Thorne Betaine HCl with Pepsin (2-3g per day)
- Pure Encapsulations Digestive Enzymes Ultra (2 capsules with most meals)

My digestion is WAY BETTER, and I think the enzymes make the biggest difference. I‚Äôm so much less hungry and my fat stores (mostly my boobs) are starting to perk up even though I haven‚Äôt gained more than a pound or two. I was eating so much food after my divorce but lost a bunch of weight, almost like it went right through me.

I have sort of suspected that I don‚Äôt need the heavy B stack now that I seem to be getting more nutrients out of my food. I eat pretty clean, lots of bone broths, vegetables, fruit, liver, mackerel, beans, and grass-fed meat. I have sugar a few times a month, and usually do 18:6 intermittent fasting. The liver has been a newer addition, and it‚Äôs my favorite part of the day.

I do Pilates 3-4 times a week. My cardio could use some work ‚Äî I do an ~8 mile hike on the weekend, usually fasted, and have recently been getting some Zone 4 cardio in by running part of it. I was getting 8-9 hours of sleep a night before things went south, and my lowest nighttime heart rate was 50-55bpm, which was low for me.

My ‚Äúexceptional‚Äù resilience felt pretty well earned and I‚Äôve been so confused about why things have continued to tank.

Two days ago, I ran out of coffee beans ‚Äî I only had enough to make a half-strength pot. Before lunch, Oura was pinging me to let me know that I‚Äôd had much more restorative time than usual. That night, I got almost nine hours of decent sleep.

I was really surprised at how much of a difference it made because my caffeine consumption hasn‚Äôt changed in months! I‚Äôm going to stick with the half-strength pot and see if it continues to help, but what gives? 

Did changing my digestion change the way I absorb and/or metabolize caffeine? Is this overmethylation? Is my vagus nerve chilled out after my divorce and more sensitive to harsh substances now? Has this ever happened to anyone else?",1,1745680505.0,Biohackers,3,0.67,False

So I decided to quit. I‚Äòm having withdrawal symptoms for sure. Headaches were really bad, but are mostly over. And man‚Ä¶my anxiety is way WAAAAY down.

1k8f6c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1k8f6c2/its_not_your_pour_height/,It's NOT your pour height,"EDIT TO ADD: lots of people seem to be misreading this. I'm not saying pour height or pour rate is not important. Only that stressing about precisely how many centimeters you are pouring from, or precisely how many ml per second you are pouring, is not going to help if you have not nailed down basic technique first. If that is controversial, well, color me surprised.

A few articles and a video concerning the effect of pour height were making the rounds pretty recently and spurring a fair bit of discussion. This is the pourover sub and is 100% the perfect spot to get into the nerdy weeds of pourover like that. But it's also a great place for people who are still in the early stages of learning technique. So, for those folks, I offer the following note:  

YOUR PRECISE POUR HEIGHT AND PRECISELY HOW MANY MILLILITERS PER SECOND YOU ARE POURING ARE NOT THAT IMPORTANT.  

There, I said it. Now, note that I said ""precise""/""precisely."" It probably goes without saying that if you are pouring in such a manner that coffee grounds are splashing everywhere, you most likely need to make an adjustment. But if you are able to pour in a spiral or circle or directly in the center--whichever technique you prefer!--without making a big mess, you're probably at least 95% of the way there in terms of pouring technique. And if you AREN'T able to do that, then the best thing to focus on is simply better technique, not how many milliliters per second you are pouring. Focusing on the latter is only going to distract you from a more general focus on controlled pouring, kind of like trying to learn to juggle fire before you've learned to juggle at all--not a good idea.  

I think the short way to say this is, if you have been seeing some of these things about the effect of pour height or pour rate and thinking that maybe those factors are the one thing you're missing to be able to produce a decent cup, it's probably NOT the right thing to worry about at the moment. On the other hand, if you've seen these things and said to yourself, ""I've played with just about every other variable, maybe I should try adjusting these,"" then yeah, go for it. But there are a lot of folks here who aren't there yet, and to them I say, don't sweat details like this until you're pretty darn confident that you're already doing a good job--it will only cause frustration.",5,1745680301.0,pourover,23,0.56,False

As someone who spends way too much time and money at local coffee shops, I was genuinely intrigued by the simplistic design and affordable price of this machine. After using it every day for more than a month, I feel confident about sharing what stood out to me‚Äîboth good and not-so-good‚Äîabout this small yet mighty device.

**Design and Build Quality**

The compact design of the Mr. Coffee ECM160-RB is an immediate win for anyone with limited countertop space. Measuring just 6.5"" D x 8"" W x 10.5"" H, it fit snugly into a corner on my kitchen counter, leaving plenty of room for other appliances. The combination of black and silver gives it a sleek look that doesn‚Äôt scream ""entry-level."" While its plastic exterior may fool you into thinking it‚Äôs fragile, it does feel durable enough for the price point. My six-year-old niece accidentally yanked on the attached frothing wand one weekend, and to my surprise, it survived unscathed. That said, if you‚Äôre looking for something premium and heavy-duty, this might not be your cup of espresso‚Äîpun intended.

**Ease of Use**

Using this machine was an absolute breeze! For someone who wouldn‚Äôt dare call themselves tech-savvy, I loved how straightforward the controls were. The single knob on the front allowed me to brew espresso and use the steamer without consulting the manual every five seconds. Filling the water tank with up to 20 ounces was relatively fuss-free too, given the included clear markings on the decanter. Also, cleaning the reusable filter was a nice surprise‚Äîit saved me both time and the ongoing expense of buying disposable filters. 

[Grab Mr. Coffee ECM160-RB at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b000u6bsi2/)  

**The Espresso Experience**

One of the pivotal questions I had before buying this was: Can it deliver decent espresso on a budget? And the answer is yes! Though it‚Äôs a steam-driven machine rather than a pump-driven one, it managed to produce rich, dark espresso shots layered with a modest crema. However, the crema wasn‚Äôt as thick or velvety as what I‚Äôve experienced with higher-end machines. For the casual espresso drinker like me, that‚Äôs a minor trade-off when you consider how much you‚Äôre saving on coffeehouse trips. By experimenting with different coffee grounds, I discovered that using freshly ground beans (medium-fine) enhanced the quality of the brew tenfold.

**Milk Frother Magic**

Ah, the frothing arm! I didn‚Äôt expect much from the built-in milk frother, but it pleasantly surprised me. Even with my terrible first attempt (I overheated the milk while dipping the wand too deep), I eventually got the hang of it, thanks to a YouTube tutorial. Skim milk produced the best results for some reason‚Äînice, fluffy foam perfect for my lattes. The removable froth aid deserves a shoutout here because it made cleaning the frother effortless. However, the wand itself is quite short, and maneuvering it around a larger milk container simply isn‚Äôt feasible. For best results, I used a smaller pitcher customized for steaming.

**Perks**

- The simple interface ensures anyone can learn to use it in under 10 minutes.
- Produces genuinely good espresso shots for its class.
- Compact size makes it an excellent choice for small kitchens or even offices.
- Easy-to-clean components, including the drip catcher and removable froth aid.
- Affordable price point compared to other espresso machines with similar features.

**Limitations**

- Milk frother wand could be longer and more flexible for different pitcher sizes.
- Crema layer on espresso is somewhat underwhelming for more experienced coffee aficionados.
- Steam-driven design doesn‚Äôt reach the pressure levels of pump machines, which impacts brewing precision.
- Plastic build, while sturdy, doesn‚Äôt impart the same quality feel as stainless steel units.
- Manual user input required‚Äîthere‚Äôs no auto-shutoff, which could be inconvenient if you‚Äôre multitasking.

**Competing Products**

If you‚Äôre shopping for an entry-level machine, the Delonghi EC155 is a worthy competitor to consider. It offers a 15-bar pump-driven system that arguably provides a more authentic espresso experience. However, it‚Äôs pricier, bulkier, and, quite frankly, not as user-friendly for beginners. On the other hand, the Nespresso Pixie takes a pod-based approach for convenience lovers. While the Pixie wins in terms of consistency and ease, the cost of pods can quickly add up, and it doesn‚Äôt allow for experimenting with freshly ground beans. The Mr. Coffee ECM160-RB strikes a balance between these two extremes, making it possibly a better long-term investment if affordability and versatility are priorities.

**Cost Efficiency**

When you see how much you would spend on lattes at a coffee shop over a couple of months, this machine practically pays for itself. While it lacks the bells and whistles of premium models, it includes just enough to make a variety of drinks at home, from cappuccinos to americanos. Pairing this machine with a good grinder and quality beans dramatically upgrades the experience. While not ideal for advanced enthusiasts, its offering at this price point is solid.

1k8f1xf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8f1xf,The BQEYZ Frost- Mid Bass in the Middle of Your Face (an unboxing and review),"Fun fact to start off: BQEYZ stands for Best Quality Earphones for YouZ. It‚Äôs almost like BQEYZ has a Brooklyn accent, and that‚Äôs awesome. I wish more audio companies had accents. ‚ÄúYouse better wise up and put some BQEYZ in ya ears‚Äù

(BQEYZ does not endorse this message.)

Thank you for the review copy, BQEYZ.

Howdy y‚Äôall! Submitted for your viewing pleasure today: the BQEYZ Frost. I say ‚Äúviewing‚Äù to begin here because the set really wants your attention, please flip through the album. The whole electric blue vibe is really fun and distinctive; it would be a sin to unpair that cable from these IEMs. A lot of people in the culinary industry say ‚ÄúYou eat with your eyes first.‚Äù Well, I feel like a set‚Äôs look can sometimes give you an idea of its sound. That's sorta the case here with this 1 dynamic, 1 micro planar driver hybrid set. But it‚Äôs complicated. Let‚Äôs check it out.

# Look and Feel

The unboxing experience is very solid. Upon opening the box you‚Äôll find the earphones peaking out from their foam nest, their glow beaming bright blue from beneath the glass faceplate. The glass gives the design beneath a sense of needed depth and allows light to reflect off the set from within. This is the first set I‚Äôve ever demoed with a glass faceplate but I must say I like the concept. The cool shimmer of the glass compliments the metallic blue snowflake design beneath. This all sits atop a very nicely CNC‚Äôd aluminum shell. Over the last two weeks the earpieces have withstood two completely-intentional, on-purpose, for-science drops from about 3 feet onto a hardwood floor and are thankfully no worse for ware. These rigorous trials have led me to conclude that the build quality is pretty decent.

Yeah that‚Äôs a nice cable right there. The electric blue snake the set comes is one of the most perfectly paired stock IEM cables I‚Äôve come across. Sets double the price often don‚Äôt come with such a match, so the Frost is definitely picking up some points for style. The cable is slightly, but not overly memory prone while being thick enough not to become tangly. The double helix design is a popular choice these days, and the chrome hardware picks up the snowflakes on the faceplate. I got a 4.4 termination, 3.5 is available as well.

In addition, the IEM comes with 2 sets of silicone eartips (atmosphere and reference), a pair of foam eartips, a hard, roomy case and a little brush. I think it‚Äôs a great accessory package for the price, although I can‚Äôt speak too much to the quality of the stock eartips. I got them to work just fine, but I have a tendency to tip roll and use my own. Today, Tangzu Tang Sancai Wide Bore.

I measured the nozzles to be 5.7mm wide at their widest point. That‚Äôs on the wider side of average, but with the non-intrusive nozzle length I easily found a comfortable fit. Please note- my ears are cavernous. However the set itself is on the more compact side when compared to many hybrid IEMs.

# Sound Impressions

There‚Äôs reason attention has been called to the mid bass. But what may be just as conspicuous as its mid bass bump is this sets sub bass roll off,  leading to a distinctive presentation that may catch you off guard. We‚Äôre not here for the Rumble, we‚Äôre here for the Slam. Combined with a somewhat sparkly yet unobtrusive treble and a fairly sharp rise in the pinna gain, we‚Äôve been given an impactful and edgy set.

**Bass**

There‚Äôs a decent sub bass roll-off in this sets frequency response from around 50hz to 10hz that really focuses all the attention of the sets dynamic driver into producing a quick, clean mid bass attack the smacks you right in the face with every beat of a kick drum. While we may not hear too much of the lowest frequencies, tracks with lots of sub bass don‚Äôt sound anemic. The presentation of the sub bass is a soft backing canvas that makes the mid bass impact all the more affecting.

The mid bass is snappy and resolved. And attack reminiscent of BA Bass with a slower, more familiar DD decay gives the set a natural sound despite its exuberance.

**Mids**

We‚Äôre not really here for the vocals. That‚Äôs not to say I didn‚Äôt enjoy them, but they sit behind the rest of the presentation just a bit. ‚ÄúRecessed‚Äù would not be the word I‚Äôd use. Let‚Äôs go with ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù. The mid range is warm and open, but it‚Äôs missing a bit of the underlying depth more subbass would bring. Male vocals can sound a touch hollow despite the warmth for this reason.

Due to that little upper mid range spike, guitars and stringed instruments are the real stars of the mid range on this set with an energetic delivery that you‚Äôll miss when it‚Äôs not around. Female vocals have a fairly strong and defined presence, but the ring of trumpets and whistle of woodwinds tend to take precedence.

**Treble**

It‚Äôs accentuated, yet controlled. Well extended, but comfortable. Some of the best treble I‚Äôve heard from a micro planar driver to be honest. Well resolved with formidable microdetail retrieval, the set boasts a treble that strikes a perfect balance between fidelity and musicality. The big 10k dip followed by a burst of air makes the set feel lively and refreshing. I found a few brighter tracks a touch sibilant, but I didn‚Äôt find it much of an issue in general. I found the treble to be the most source-dependent aspect of the Frost. A clean, neutral source is a must for controlled treble on this set. I used a DTC 800 for testing.

**Techs**

The soundstage is wide and spacious, but it‚Äôs not very deep. This leaves you in a slightly more intimate setting, and that sense of closeness is at the heart of this sets impact and energy. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm watching the band in the middle of a giant arena. I feel like I‚Äôm at an open mic night at a small coffee shop that‚Äôs about to get shut down for breaking all the noise ordinances. It‚Äôs a set that puts you in the middle of the action.

The demure sub bass and hybrid configuration allow the set a clarity and resolution unmuddied by obtrusive low frequencies. The set had accurate imaging with very adept instrument separation. The set handles busy tracks well for its price range, and I was only able to notice some bass distortion when turning it up to volume levels I should not be listening to music at.

# Final Thoughts

I wasn‚Äôt really expecting what I got. It‚Äôs seems a sub bass roll off is a common feature of the BQEYZ house tuning, and I understand why. The snap and bounce of the mid bass is pretty addicting, and it‚Äôs rare to find a mid bass attack that quick outside of all-BA set. I listen to lots of rock, indie rock, pop, jazz and instrumental music. The Frost is great for the majority of my library, but it can sound a bit reserved on tracks that rely on lots of sub bass. If you‚Äôre the type that has more than 1 IEM (hey), this may evolve into an invaluable part of your arsenal. It‚Äôs not a jack-of-all-trades. It‚Äôs more a master of its craft. And that craft is mid bass.

**Why This Pick?**

The last 5 straight encounters between these two squads have seen more than 213 points, friends. To be frank, I think the Cavaliers just boast too much fire power to expect a low-scoring affair. If you think Miami will put more than 100 points on the board this afternoon (and they have in both post-season meetings so far‚Ä¶), the Over is a relatively safe bet. In fact, the Heat‚Äôs last 10 straight games in the regular season all saw 213 points or more. Comically, I don‚Äôt usually like taking ‚ÄòOvers‚Äô during daytime matchups (I‚Äôm a weirdo, I know‚Ä¶) But today? I‚Äôm on the Over to cash in Miami.

I recently tried making a fruit-infused cold brew coffee at home because I love experimenting with flavors. I attempted an orange infusion by adding fresh orange slices directly into the cold brew jar while brewing. I let it steep for about 14 hours in the fridge. However, when I tasted it, the brew had turned noticeably bitter ‚Äî not the refreshing citrus note I was hoping for!
I‚Äôm wondering if I made a mistake in the process. Should the fruit be added during brewing, or is it better to infuse it after the cold brew is already made? Also, does the type of fruit matter ‚Äî like would it work differently with something soft like bananas or berries?
If anyone has experience with fruit-infused cold brews, I would love to hear your tips or any recipes you recommend! Especially curious about what fruits work best and how to avoid that bitter taste.

I've returned to Concerta after many years and I've wondering if coffee affects the pill's working mechanism if taken alongside it.

January 25th, 2020. Time Unknown. Location Unknown.

A young man screamed in pain. His body seized up, and he lay on his bed for several seconds, writhing in agony. Then, after the pain wore off, he breathed heavily, swallowed hard, and gritted his teeth.

""**Implant!** Gaaahhh!!! Fffffuck! FUCK!""

Jason Hiro clutched the side of his head. Madam Mildred stood beside the bed, watching him closely while holding onto a strange spiritual 'wire' tethered to his Mind Realm. She monitored the progress of his MindCore's construction while nodding to herself every so often.

""Ninety-five percent complete. Hang in just a while longer, dear boy.""

Tears streamed from Jason's eyes. His pillow had long ago been soaked through from his unstoppable sobs of pain. Never had he suffered such horrors in all his life. It was as if he were not only allowing someone else to stab his brain with knives, but being forced to encourage them to stab him even faster.

""Hurts... hurts so much!"" Jason exclaimed for perhaps the hundredth time. ""No! Why does it hurt this much? Why? Why???""

""You know why. Stop delaying."" Mildred said. ""The more you drag this out, the longer your suffering will last. We can't stop once we've begun. Now hurry up!""

Jason remained silent for several seconds. His father stood on the opposite side of the bed, his palms crossed in front of his waist. Hideki's role was simple. As the only corporeal entity in this time-accelerated realm, he had to make sure Jason didn't thrash around and fall off the bed, injuring himself severely. Other than that, all he could do was wait and watch.

Even when he wasn't actively Wordsmithing to complete the next step of his Mind Realm's upgrade, Jason's torture continued. It never stopped. Until the GenesisFrame was completed, his mind would be in a permanent state of cyber-psychosis, leaving him totally vulnerable to enemy attack. He wouldn't be able to think properly, and would be at the mercy of anyone who held ill intentions.

Mildred transmitted another data pulse into Jason's Mind Realm. ""Next, the Quantum Transistors.""

Her voice held no playfulness. She took this assignment as seriously as anyone ever could. Mildred might be a bit of a jovial lady, but she did not want to be responsible for the mental collapse of humanity's mightiest Trueborn. Jason's survival was paramount. He had already endured ten time-accelerated days of sleeplessness. Now, he was in the final hours of completing his MindCore.

Jason trembled. He squeezed his eyes shut, hazily envisioning the blueprints Mildred sent his way. Then he spoke through his teeth.

""**F...FORM!**""

Inside his Mind Realm, a supercomputer unlike any other existed in a state between corporeal and incorporeal. Tens of millions of 'cables' traveled in any number of directions, traversing between the imaginary realm of his Mind, and the physical realm of his Brain. They plugged into specific neurons inside his brain, allowing for the perfect and efficient transfer of information between the physical and metaphysical universe.

At once, the GenesisFrame momentarily became corporeal as tens of thousands of nearly invisible transistors trapped between quantum states appeared all throughout its mainframe. Then, it turned ghostly again, and pulses of mana fired into Jason's brain, making him scream in pain once more.

""Aaaargh! Ah-ah-ahhhh! No more! No! No more!!""

""Just hold on!"" Hideki shouted, encouraging his son. ""You're so close, Jason! So close!""

""Ninety-five percent!"" Mildred repeated. ""You've made it this far! Don't die on me now, dear boy!""

Mildred chewed her lip. She looked at Hideki, but he didn't meet her gaze.

_Has Cat Mask rewound time at all?_ Mildred stealthily wondered. _Perhaps the procedure failed and this is the second time? The third? Maybe the hundredth? Or it might even be the first. I don't know if it will work or not, but I must have faith!_

In truth, the GenesisFrame was far more complex than Jason's old mental supercomputer. That one, designed by his wife, had been upgraded piecemeal over the years. Fiona was a genius, but she was no Mildred. She designed it like a plug-and-play computer system, adding more capacity, storage space, memory speed, and other enhancements over a long period of time. The final product was definitely superior to Jason's physical brain, but in theory, it wasn't one percent as fearsome as Mildred's MindCore. Hers was designed to work together in perfect harmony, without any bottlenecks, each piece of the machine as focused and enhanced as it could ever possibly be. The only way she could improve it further was if she were to tap into the brain or brains of several high ranking Volgrim Technopaths.

Perhaps with their deep understanding of technology, Mildred might be able to upgrade Jason's GenesisFrame a thousand times beyond the design she had currently envisioned.

But that was only a possibility for a tentative future. Mildred refocused her thoughts and efforts on the subject at hand.

""Next data-burst."" Mildred said authoritatively, transmitting the next step of the GenesisFrame's construction to Jason. ""Focus! Bear with the pain! Remember your wife!""

Jason nodded weakly. He felt as if he had lost all the blood in his body. His bones seemed to have lost ninety percent of their density. Even the simple act of breathing made him want to die.

""Phoe...be..."" Jason whimpered.

...

Five more hours passed.

""This is it!"" Mildred exclaimed, her voice raising an octave. ""The final step! We're almost there, Jason! Now... do it! Complete the device!""

Jason lay unmoving on the bed. His consciousness wavered in and out of reality. The world around him... seemed so distant.

None of this was worth it.

He just... wanted... to go to sleep.

Sleep.

He could see Phoebe again. In the next life.

They could be together once more.

Jason's eyes began to close.

His eyelids felt... so heavy...

""Son."" Hideki said, leaning forward. The man's expression was as dark as the night. ""Don't give up. You'll do it this time. Come on.""

He gently touched Jason's face. The Wordsmith... didn't respond.

Cat Mask closed his eyes.

""Another failure.""

Mildred's heart jumped. What did he mean by-

""No..."" Jason said, his voice barely audible. ""Can't... give... up...""

His cloudy eyes regained the tiniest hint of light. He coughed, and blood spilled from his mouth. ""Must... finish... must... must...""

Cat Mask leaned forward. His body vibrated for a moment, then he brought his face within inches of his son.

""One last push, kid. Come on. For Daisy. For your _little girl._""

Jason closed his eyes. He swallowed a shallow breath...

Then his body stiffened.

""**Man...if... manif... MANIFEST!**""

A faint light sparked within his Mind Realm. A massive burst of data shot out of the wire Mildred was holding on to, electrocuting her spirit and making her shriek in pain. She quickly dropped the spiritual anchor and looked at the Wordsmith with shining eyes.

""It's done?!"" She asked.

Jason lay there, unmoving. But his breathing became less labored. His body shook, not with pain, but with the feeling of exhaustion.

His Mind Realm became reinvigorated. His GenesisFrame fully manifested into reality.

The procedure was a success!

Jason didn't celebrate. He didn't even seem aware of what had happened. Instead, he fell fast asleep, the exhaustion of a ten day procedure completely swallowing his mind.

Hideki continued to stare at his son's face from a few inches away. Then, he smiled and stood up.

""It worked."" Hideki said, more to himself than anyone else.

Mildred looked at Hideki. This time, he met her gaze.

""How... how many times did we perform the procedure?"" Mildred asked, a lump in her throat.

Hideki remained quiet for a moment.

""Just once."" He lied.

...................................

Jason slept for two days. He awoke slowly, his body still weak with exhaustion, and a fever burning his forehead. His skull seemed molten, like it was trying to contain a volcano. His vision blurred, and what faint hazy figures he could make out seemed so very, very distant. Voices crept into his ears. He blearily felt that this moment was eerily similar to so many times in the past when he had suffered horrible concussions.

He pulled himself to a sitting position, then stared ahead in a daze.

The Wordsmith couldn't quite... couldn't... couldn't remember... what was he doing? Who was he? Where was he?

His mind whirred into action.

_Jason Hiro. Wordsmith. Ability to manifest Words of Power into reality. Current location: Secret time accelerated realm. Current realspace date and time: January 25th, 5:46 PM assuming West Coast USA time zone._

He nodded, the motion making his head swim with delirium. ""Ohhh... thass... hellfull...""

After thinking for a moment, Jason asked himself another question.

[I feel like shit. How do I... not? Feel like shit.]

_Analysis of current condition. Suffering from pain-induced psychosis. Severe delirium as a result of newly installed hardware attached to cerebellum. Incorrect attachment points are creating a negative feedback loop. Suggestion: Realignment via Word of Power. New attachment points suggested here, here, and here._

[Oh. So it's like that.]

""**Realign.**"" Jason said.

Inside his brain, something unseen by the outside world changed. Jason's vision sharpened, and the world around him came into focus. Just like that, his fever dropped, and his thinking realigned.

""Hm? You Wordsmithed?"" Mildred asked, still standing next to him. ""I'm glad to see you awake, dear boy. You weren't responding to anything I said.""

Jason looked at her. His eyes were sharper than before.

""Sorry, Mildred."" Jason said. ""It seemed to be a cerebral misalignment with the polymolecule cables. They were attached to the incorrect dendrites, causing me to suffer a severe fever that likely would have- what? Why are you looking at me like that?""

Mildred gaped at the young man, then quickly closed her mouth. ""I... I just... amazing! Ho-ho-ho! It really worked, young Wordsmith! This beauty is truly a genius! My inventions are unparalleled!""

Jason nodded. He suddenly recalled what he'd just said.

""Whoa. I don't usually talk like that. I feel like my vocabulary has increased substantially.""

Another Hero walked into the room.

""Good to see you awake, child."" Jepthath said, crossing his arms. The spiritual ancestor nodded as he assessed Jason's condition. ""You gave us several scares, but it seems you pulled through. How are you feeling?""

Jason started to answer, but for some reason, he felt his attention being drawn to a bedside table on his right. He kept looking at it and frowning.

""Something the matter?"" Jepthath asked.

""I don't know."" Jason said, swinging his legs over the side of the bed while looking at the table more intently. ""I Wordsmithed this? It's so... ugly.""

Jepthath blinked. He didn't really understand how the topic of discussion had landed on, of all things, a bedside table.

""Don't you think we should talk about more pressing issues?"" Jepthath asked. He looked at Mildred, but she seemed just as perplexed by Jason's behavior. She shrugged at her fellow ancestor.

""It's just... _man_, this thing is so ugly. So sloppy."" Jason grumbled. ""It looks completely artificial and fake. When I made it, I clearly didn't put any effort into aesthetics. I simply Wordsmithed the simplest and most basic-looking bedside table that came to mind. It's a square! Doesn't even have any flared edges on top, the legs are mere stumps sticking out of the bottom, and it's all one piece. No real carpenter would craft something this ugly. They'd assemble it using multiple hand-made pieces, gluing them, nailing them, pressing them together. Doesn't it just disgust you to look at?""

Jason looked at his ancestors for validation, but they gave him looks of confusion in response.

""...Again, this hardly seems important."" Jepthath said slowly.

""Well, it's important to me."" Jason muttered, turning back to the table. ""One moment.""

Instantly, Jason analyzed the table's structure. Dozens of nails, wooden slabs, internal drawer frames, and even a stained and patterned surface materialized in his head. As if drawing a three-dimensional blueprint with just his mind, he crafted a completely new bedside table vastly different and much more artisanal than the one before him. Then, he squinted and looked at the existing one.

""**Replace.**""

The small table blurred in place. A faint aura of white light covered its appearance, then thousands of individual pieces materialized in reality, rapidly colliding together and assembling a brand new bedside table in the same spot as before. To Jepthath and Mildred, it almost looked as if a horde of invisible carpenters were rebuilding the table piece by piece at superliminal speeds, drilling screws into place, applying glue, realigning individual components, until...

The new bedside table manifested in reality. Jason sat there for a moment looking at it, then he abruptly stood up, losing all interest in the beautiful new piece of carpentry he had just assembled.

""Thank god."" Jason mumbled. ""Way too ugly. Distractingly so. Anyway, what are we working on now?""

He was met with two ancestors, both trying to pull their jaws up from the floor.

""I... Jason, are you feeling alright, dear boy?"" Mildred asked, after a few moments of hesitation. ""You seem... very different from before...""

Jason scoffed. ""What, you see a guy build a table and lose your minds? It's just a table. Come on, I've been missing out on developments in meatspace because of the operation.""

He started to walk away, then paused and looked down at his white T-shirt and sweatpants. His expression turned ugly.

""God. What the hell am I wearing? So sloppy. One second...""

A moment later, Jason Wordsmithed again. ""**Clothes.**""

Instead of his signature T-shirt and jeans, which he had worn in various colors for years, Jason donned a noticeably snazzier long sleeved black shirt made of cashmere that also sported lines of gold trim traveling from the collar down the sleeves, along with some elastic jeans in a similar color pattern. His clothes weren't only more impressive looking, but they seemed to go extremely well with his physical build, and they also had armor woven into them. A bullet to the chest would ricochet right off the mysterious material compromising his new sweater.

""It'll do for now."" Jason muttered to himself, still somewhat disgusted with his 'rudimentary' clothes. ""Really going to need to put some thought into a new wardrobe later. Can't go walking around looking like a total dump now, can I?""

Mildred and Jepthath exchanged glances once more.

Jason was acting very different from before the operation. Mildred naturally assumed a cognitive boost would affect his personality... but to _this_ extent? Even she was surprised.

...


Jason stepped into the main chamber, where his Spynet was running, his father sitting in front of the computer screens, sipping coffee. Every time Jason looked at any object, no matter how complex or benign, his expression shifted to one of pain and disgust, making it constantly look like hideous, naked invisible people were slapping him across the face one after the other.

""What the hell was wrong with me?"" Jason grumbled to himself, as Mildred and Jepthath followed behind him, gradually growing accustomed to his verbal outbursts. ""This shit is so ass. Why did I make these monitors so low-resolution? I can do better than that. And the optimization of camera placements? Abysmal. The angles are all wrong. Oh, hey dad.""

Hideki turned away from the monitors to look at his son. ""Good morning, Jason. Huh. Nice clothes.""

Jason grimaced. ""Don't. Just don't. They're barely passable for now. I'm already feeling rather _wretched_ just wearing them.""

Hideki blinked. ""Okay. Want to hear what happened while you were asleep?""

Jason nodded. ""I'm all ears.""

Hideki changed one of the monitors and started telling Jason about Ose's ascension to Emperor. Jason frowned, making Hideki think he didn't like this news. Actually, it turned out Jason truly detested looking at that imperfect and ugly monitor. It was just so inefficient. The energy waste alone! Why did he copy crappy 21st century monitors when he could steal and improve on Volgrim tech? Was his previous self _stupid_?

""Yeah, yeah, Ose's an Emperor now."" Jason said, holding up his hand to stop his father mid-sentence. ""Hold on, just a sec. I can't stand these ugly fucking computer monitors, not for a second longer. I mean seriously? Sixty hertz? What kind of refresh speed is that anyway? Are these monitors for peasants??""

Inside Jason's mind, a blueprint of the original monitors appeared. A phantasmal version of Jason appeared before that blueprint, and began ripping it apart and putting it back together at blinding speeds. New components rapidly disassembled and reassembled. Transistors and circuit boards drastically improved. Jason even casually started uttering Words of Power midway through, peeking out across the vastness of space to look at the distant world of Volgarius. He stole a few thousand other designs for new monitors, took a look at them, grimaced as if he were about to vomit, and made casual modifications to unify them all together.

After that, Jason looked at the array of Spynet monitors, then spoke a Word of Power. ""**Rebuild.**""

Within twenty real-time seconds, every monitor disassembled and reassembled itself. Ethereal components manifested into reality. Hideki watched with marveling eyes as the entire Spynet visual component became whole again, reflecting the same images as before. Only, now...!

Hideki squinted. ""Err... did anything change?""

""What do you mean?"" Jason asked, narrowing his eyes. ""Can't you see the difference? Look at the fidelity! I cut the power draw by 99.9%! I created several new exotic alloys just to reduce power consumption alone, and then I increased the resolution from 1080p to a number that human marketing conventions can't capture. On top of that, the displays now refresh over a million times per second! We can monitor the galaxy witha  level of quality even eagle eyes couldn't match!""

Cat Mask nodded slowly. ""Oh, alright. That's really neat, son.""

""Can you SERIOUSLY not see the difference?!"" Jason roared. ""It's so obvious! What are you, a peasant?!""

Hideki looked at his son, then shrugged. ""I don't know. It all looks the same to me. But if you're happy, I'm happy.""

""Oh my god..."" Jason muttered, his expression turning downcast. He seemed to age five years in an instant. He turned away, his face an amalgamation of horror. ""This... is this how Ose feels, every moment of every day? Doomed for nobody to appreciate the perfection of her designs?!""

Mildred inhaled softly. She gently facepalmed.

""Oh, my dear boy. We are going to need to have a _long_, hard talk about your new capabilities.""",14,1745679933.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

A young man screamed in pain. His body seized up, and he lay on his bed for several seconds, writhing in agony. Then, after the pain wore off, he breathed heavily, swallowed hard, and gritted his teeth.

""**Implant!** Gaaahhh!!! Fffffuck! FUCK!""

Jason Hiro clutched the side of his head. Madam Mildred stood beside the bed, watching him closely while holding onto a strange spiritual 'wire' tethered to his Mind Realm. She monitored the progress of his MindCore's construction while nodding to herself every so often.

""Ninety-five percent complete. Hang in just a while longer, dear boy.""

Tears streamed from Jason's eyes. His pillow had long ago been soaked through from his unstoppable sobs of pain. Never had he suffered such horrors in all his life. It was as if he were not only allowing someone else to stab his brain with knives, but being forced to encourage them to stab him even faster.

""Hurts... hurts so much!"" Jason exclaimed for perhaps the hundredth time. ""No! Why does it hurt this much? Why? Why???""

""You know why. Stop delaying."" Mildred said. ""The more you drag this out, the longer your suffering will last. We can't stop once we've begun. Now hurry up!""

Jason remained silent for several seconds. His father stood on the opposite side of the bed, his palms crossed in front of his waist. Hideki's role was simple. As the only corporeal entity in this time-accelerated realm, he had to make sure Jason didn't thrash around and fall off the bed, injuring himself severely. Other than that, all he could do was wait and watch.

Even when he wasn't actively Wordsmithing to complete the next step of his Mind Realm's upgrade, Jason's torture continued. It never stopped. Until the GenesisFrame was completed, his mind would be in a permanent state of cyber-psychosis, leaving him totally vulnerable to enemy attack. He wouldn't be able to think properly, and would be at the mercy of anyone who held ill intentions.

Mildred transmitted another data pulse into Jason's Mind Realm. ""Next, the Quantum Transistors.""

Her voice held no playfulness. She took this assignment as seriously as anyone ever could. Mildred might be a bit of a jovial lady, but she did not want to be responsible for the mental collapse of humanity's mightiest Trueborn. Jason's survival was paramount. He had already endured ten time-accelerated days of sleeplessness. Now, he was in the final hours of completing his MindCore.

Jason trembled. He squeezed his eyes shut, hazily envisioning the blueprints Mildred sent his way. Then he spoke through his teeth.

""**F...FORM!**""

Inside his Mind Realm, a supercomputer unlike any other existed in a state between corporeal and incorporeal. Tens of millions of 'cables' traveled in any number of directions, traversing between the imaginary realm of his Mind, and the physical realm of his Brain. They plugged into specific neurons inside his brain, allowing for the perfect and efficient transfer of information between the physical and metaphysical universe.

At once, the GenesisFrame momentarily became corporeal as tens of thousands of nearly invisible transistors trapped between quantum states appeared all throughout its mainframe. Then, it turned ghostly again, and pulses of mana fired into Jason's brain, making him scream in pain once more.

""Aaaargh! Ah-ah-ahhhh! No more! No! No more!!""

""Just hold on!"" Hideki shouted, encouraging his son. ""You're so close, Jason! So close!""

""Ninety-five percent!"" Mildred repeated. ""You've made it this far! Don't die on me now, dear boy!""

Mildred chewed her lip. She looked at Hideki, but he didn't meet her gaze.

_Has Cat Mask rewound time at all?_ Mildred stealthily wondered. _Perhaps the procedure failed and this is the second time? The third? Maybe the hundredth? Or it might even be the first. I don't know if it will work or not, but I must have faith!_

In truth, the GenesisFrame was far more complex than Jason's old mental supercomputer. That one, designed by his wife, had been upgraded piecemeal over the years. Fiona was a genius, but she was no Mildred. She designed it like a plug-and-play computer system, adding more capacity, storage space, memory speed, and other enhancements over a long period of time. The final product was definitely superior to Jason's physical brain, but in theory, it wasn't one percent as fearsome as Mildred's MindCore. Hers was designed to work together in perfect harmony, without any bottlenecks, each piece of the machine as focused and enhanced as it could ever possibly be. The only way she could improve it further was if she were to tap into the brain or brains of several high ranking Volgrim Technopaths.

Perhaps with their deep understanding of technology, Mildred might be able to upgrade Jason's GenesisFrame a thousand times beyond the design she had currently envisioned.

But that was only a possibility for a tentative future. Mildred refocused her thoughts and efforts on the subject at hand.

""Next data-burst."" Mildred said authoritatively, transmitting the next step of the GenesisFrame's construction to Jason. ""Focus! Bear with the pain! Remember your wife!""

Jason nodded weakly. He felt as if he had lost all the blood in his body. His bones seemed to have lost ninety percent of their density. Even the simple act of breathing made him want to die.

""Phoe...be..."" Jason whimpered.

...

Five more hours passed.

""This is it!"" Mildred exclaimed, her voice raising an octave. ""The final step! We're almost there, Jason! Now... do it! Complete the device!""

Jason lay unmoving on the bed. His consciousness wavered in and out of reality. The world around him... seemed so distant.

None of this was worth it.

He just... wanted... to go to sleep.

Sleep.

He could see Phoebe again. In the next life.

They could be together once more.

Jason's eyes began to close.

His eyelids felt... so heavy...

""Son."" Hideki said, leaning forward. The man's expression was as dark as the night. ""Don't give up. You'll do it this time. Come on.""

He gently touched Jason's face. The Wordsmith... didn't respond.

Cat Mask closed his eyes.

""Another failure.""

Mildred's heart jumped. What did he mean by-

""No..."" Jason said, his voice barely audible. ""Can't... give... up...""

His cloudy eyes regained the tiniest hint of light. He coughed, and blood spilled from his mouth. ""Must... finish... must... must...""

Cat Mask leaned forward. His body vibrated for a moment, then he brought his face within inches of his son.

""One last push, kid. Come on. For Daisy. For your _little girl._""

Jason closed his eyes. He swallowed a shallow breath...

Then his body stiffened.

""**Man...if... manif... MANIFEST!**""

A faint light sparked within his Mind Realm. A massive burst of data shot out of the wire Mildred was holding on to, electrocuting her spirit and making her shriek in pain. She quickly dropped the spiritual anchor and looked at the Wordsmith with shining eyes.

""It's done?!"" She asked.

Jason lay there, unmoving. But his breathing became less labored. His body shook, not with pain, but with the feeling of exhaustion.

His Mind Realm became reinvigorated. His GenesisFrame fully manifested into reality.

The procedure was a success!

Jason didn't celebrate. He didn't even seem aware of what had happened. Instead, he fell fast asleep, the exhaustion of a ten day procedure completely swallowing his mind.

Hideki continued to stare at his son's face from a few inches away. Then, he smiled and stood up.

""It worked."" Hideki said, more to himself than anyone else.

Mildred looked at Hideki. This time, he met her gaze.

""How... how many times did we perform the procedure?"" Mildred asked, a lump in her throat.

Hideki remained quiet for a moment.

""Just once."" He lied.

...................................

Jason slept for two days. He awoke slowly, his body still weak with exhaustion, and a fever burning his forehead. His skull seemed molten, like it was trying to contain a volcano. His vision blurred, and what faint hazy figures he could make out seemed so very, very distant. Voices crept into his ears. He blearily felt that this moment was eerily similar to so many times in the past when he had suffered horrible concussions.

He pulled himself to a sitting position, then stared ahead in a daze.

The Wordsmith couldn't quite... couldn't... couldn't remember... what was he doing? Who was he? Where was he?

His mind whirred into action.

_Jason Hiro. Wordsmith. Ability to manifest Words of Power into reality. Current location: Secret time accelerated realm. Current realspace date and time: January 25th, 5:46 PM assuming West Coast USA time zone._

He nodded, the motion making his head swim with delirium. ""Ohhh... thass... hellfull...""

After thinking for a moment, Jason asked himself another question.

[I feel like shit. How do I... not? Feel like shit.]

_Analysis of current condition. Suffering from pain-induced psychosis. Severe delirium as a result of newly installed hardware attached to cerebellum. Incorrect attachment points are creating a negative feedback loop. Suggestion: Realignment via Word of Power. New attachment points suggested here, here, and here._

[Oh. So it's like that.]

""**Realign.**"" Jason said.

Inside his brain, something unseen by the outside world changed. Jason's vision sharpened, and the world around him came into focus. Just like that, his fever dropped, and his thinking realigned.

""Hm? You Wordsmithed?"" Mildred asked, still standing next to him. ""I'm glad to see you awake, dear boy. You weren't responding to anything I said.""

Jason looked at her. His eyes were sharper than before.

""Sorry, Mildred."" Jason said. ""It seemed to be a cerebral misalignment with the polymolecule cables. They were attached to the incorrect dendrites, causing me to suffer a severe fever that likely would have- what? Why are you looking at me like that?""

Mildred gaped at the young man, then quickly closed her mouth. ""I... I just... amazing! Ho-ho-ho! It really worked, young Wordsmith! This beauty is truly a genius! My inventions are unparalleled!""

1k8f15f,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1k8f15f/how_does_the_zulay_z1_motor_milk_frother_stand/,How does the Zulay Z1 Motor Milk Frother stand out in reviews?,"Testing out the Zulay Kitchen Z1 Motor Milk Frother made me realize how much I had been missing out when it came to perfecting my at-home coffee game. This stylish little device, with its Blizzard White finish and compact size, is a game-changer for anyone who enjoys lattes, cappuccinos, or even matcha. From its sturdy stainless-steel construction to its powerful motor, there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here. But let me break my experience down into digestible sections, so you can see what makes this handheld milk frother stand out‚Äîand where it might fall short.

**Modern and User-Friendly Design**  
Its compact Blizzard White body looks sleek and fits effortlessly into my kitchen setup. The stand that comes with it is a simple yet underrated addition. Instead of rummaging through a drawer, the frother can stand upright and remain easily accessible. Its ergonomic design ensures a comfortable grip, even during extended use. Frankly, for a kitchen appliance, it feels premium without being over the top. However, I did notice that it‚Äôs slightly heavier than expected at 9.1 ounces, though not enough to cause discomfort.

**Hands-On Performance**  
Once I got the two AA Duracell batteries inserted (not included in the package), the frother powered up like a mini workhorse. Its efficiency in turning milk into velvety foam within mere seconds stunned me. I tested it on almond milk, oat milk, and even regular cream, and the results were consistently top-notch. It‚Äôs not just a milk frother, though. Mixing matcha powder into water? Not a problem. No clumps, even with protein shakes, which makes it my go-to for prepping quick drinks. 

The speed and power of the Zulay Z1 Motor Milk Frother are impressive given the size, but I did wonder whether dial-based speed settings could've added to its versatility. For instance, frothing cold milk sometimes needs a gentler touch, which this frother doesn‚Äôt provide.

[See Zulay Kitchen Z1 Motor Milk Frother deals on Amazon now.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0d1lcc57v/)  

**Wide Variety of Applications**  
This is not just a coffee gadget; it‚Äôs an all-rounder. You can whisk, froth, and mix a variety of things. I even gave it a try on eggs, and this little marvel did a decent job. I‚Äôve also started using it to make hot chocolate for the kids and to mix butter into their soups‚Äîit works wonders for both. However, as much as I love it, the whisk attachment struggles a bit with thicker liquids. For heavy-duty mixing, you‚Äôd still want to rely on a heavier-duty kitchen tool.

**Easy to Maintain**  
Maintenance has always been one of my least favorite parts of using any kitchen gadget, but this device made clean-up effortless. After using it, I just ran the whisk under hot water while briefly turning it on, and voil√†‚Äîit was clean! That being said, its ""hand wash only"" care instructions might concern some users who prefer throwing everything into the dishwasher and calling it a day.

**Positives**  
Some of the standout features of this device include:  
- Compact design with an ergonomic grip, plus a stand for convenient storage.  
- Continuous, reliable performance on various milk types like soy, almond, and whole milk.  
- Delicious results for coffee froth, matcha tea, protein shakes, and more.  

**Limitations**  
Despite its strengths, a few hurdles exist:  
- No adjustable speed control, which can be limiting for certain tasks.  
- Slightly heavier than some competitors in its category.  
- Not dishwasher-friendly, so manual cleaning is necessary.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing the Zulay frother to other brands such as the PowerLix or the Bonsenkitchen model, the Zulay frother excels in providing consistent froth quality and durability. Many competitors lack its sturdy metal stand or fall short when blending thicker liquids. However, devices like PowerLix come with variable speed settings, giving users greater control, an area Zulay could improve upon.

**Value Proposition**  
In terms of affordable quality, this frother meets the mark effectively. While some may argue that handheld frothers without a rechargeable design could be a hassle (considering the reliance on AA batteries), the sleek design and excellent performance more than make up for it. For something that handles both frothy coffees and casual protein shakes with ease, the investment feels worthwhile.

Please  read this post in full before messaging me!  

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. I won‚Äôt bring any drama into your life. 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!",0,1745679674.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,0.5,False

The candles flicked occasional embers onto the table, the feeble glow an intimate light in this strange and unfamiliar place. Monika sat, hands folded, another freshly brewed cup of coffee before her.

Before her, a hazel haired chibi sat, a delicate smile permanent on her face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you enjoy it!‚Äù Mocha said.

When it came to a much needed break from chaos, this certainly served as one. Though, it didn‚Äôt spare Monika, nor Michi from having some questions. Mocha was trustworthy, absolutely, but this place was so unknown to both of them.

‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve seen you before,‚Äù Michi said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you have,‚Äù Mocha nodded, ‚ÄúI work part time at Chibi Desserts. Though‚Ä¶ ever since the owner went missing at the beginning of summer, that outlet of work has kind of disappeared.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you made this place?‚Äù Monika said.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ this was sort of my answer to Chibi Desserts a while ago. Me and Sayo had a playful rivalry. It was never actually serious. I‚Äôll say, I certainly benefited when it came to accessibility. Notice what I did there, being so inconspicuously close to the Reserves?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd then you had to let Sayo go because of those circumstances‚Ä¶ gosh, I‚Äôm sorry Mocha,‚Äù Monika lamented.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay! Somehow I don‚Äôt think she was doing it out of malice. When she has faith in someone, she *really* has faith in them, that‚Äôs all. Even when that someone may not‚Ä¶ see the world the way most do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you looking at me?‚Äù Michi said.

The two giggled.

‚ÄúWait, but why is this place underground now? If you‚Äôre trying to be accessible, I don‚Äôt really think‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it wasn‚Äôt as hidden as before. In light of all the chaos that‚Äôs seemed to come from this forest though, I‚Äôve made this change. Less customers from folks other than Chibis, but it‚Äôs also a good change from a strategic point of view.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù Sunyori piped in, ‚ÄúAfter all, this underground shop is part of one big interconnected system below Akemi.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶?‚Äù Monika blinked. Sure, there was what looked like a passage behind them. Infinite darkness, so who knew where it led. ‚ÄúThis is the first I‚Äôve heard of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not surprised,‚Äù Mocha said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a priceless artifact down the way there. And it‚Äôs not lost on me why Sunyori came to me now. After all, that artifact may prove useful when it comes to this console-less conundrum.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a failsafe created by the system,‚Äù Sunyori said, ‚ÄúThink of it as a portable piece of that central console we saw up there. As you saw with Natalie, she was able to use that console specifically to do actions, while we were unable to do anything with our ordinary ones. The artifact is a portable all purpose console for use even in transmissions that would disallow normal console actions.‚Äù

Monika blinked. ‚Äú...Okay, I think I get it. But‚Äî why would it just be here? Under a‚Äî as far as I can tell ‚Äîunremarkable city, somewhere below a random forest?‚Äù

Mocha smiled daringly. ‚ÄúEveryone who knows the coding aspects of this world has asked that for a while. Who knows, maybe it‚Äôs the system‚Äôs way of lending us a hand. Maybe it knows something like this was bound to happen one day.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can a system *know* something?‚Äù

‚ÄúEver heard of the Shining Light?‚Äù she asked.

‚Äú...No‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rumor spread through the Reserves. If one were to meet an unfortunate fate, that won‚Äôt be the end for them. The Shining Light will bring them back, reinforce the purpose they must fulfill.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶‚Äù Monika‚Äôs eyes sank to the cracks in the table. *If one were to meet an unfortunate fate, that won‚Äôt be the end.* Is that what was happening now? After all, they saw Natalie fade out of existence courtesy of Suki during their camping trip. Was that just a farce? Not only that, but Suki, she was out for a while after the beach incident. Was that it, too?

‚ÄúThis Shining Light‚Ä¶‚Äù Monika whispered, ‚ÄúTell me more.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt the unknown what makes conspiracies fun?‚Äù she winked.

Monika frowned.

‚Äú...Or, to be more blunt, I don‚Äôt know more.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn any case, if we‚Äôre done here, we should get to the artifact, pronto,‚Äù Sunyori said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our best shot of putting Natalie back in her place.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ guys?‚Äù Monika said, eyeing next to her. ‚Äú...Where‚Äôs Michi?‚Äù

In the distance, two things echoed. The sound of shattered glass, and the rhythm of a thousand tiny footsteps.
~~~
MEANWHILE‚Ä¶
~~~
‚ÄúUggh‚Ä¶‚Äù

Maybe it was a good thing he hadn‚Äôt wandered to this building during their first trip here. He understood the pun, but what was the point of just having a building dedicated to a desert? How long had they been in here? And how was it that Sayori was still able to retain all of her energy, despite how smoldering hot it was?

They‚Äôd finally made it to wherever she was taking them. When they came to the wall, she crouched. ‚ÄúSomethings down here. I just have this gut feeling.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally‚Ä¶?‚Äù MC huffed.

She began scattering the dirt. Sure enough, there was a vent covering. ‚Ä¶Not really the result he was expecting, but she was right, it was *something.* And then she started removing it. He stepped forward, ‚ÄúWh- what are you doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúSuki and Yulia said this building leads to some sort of artifact. If it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs not supposed to be part of the park, I don‚Äôt think they would have the opening stick out like a sore thumb.‚Äù

‚ÄúSayori‚Äî our friends are who knows where and we‚Äôre worrying ourselves with a random artifact that has nothing to do with‚Äî‚Äù

*CRASH*

The vent covering fell into the depths.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù MC said, ‚ÄúWhatever you say.‚Äù

The entrance opened. The footsteps were back. Suddenly he was very open to going down this vent covering. ‚ÄúUm, uh, Sayori‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHup!‚Äù She leapt down, leaving him up here, completely helpless. Down there, she held out her hands, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll catch you, come on!‚Äù

He looked back. If he waited, the Sukimores were only going to get closer. But looking down, it was quite a drop. Didn‚Äôt Sayori say that after her powers wore off, she‚Äôd be deprived of energy? How was she still kicking even after a fall like that?

He closed his eyes, and leapt like it was the last thing he would do. He grit his teeth, bracing for the impact. A sharp, stinging pain hit him in the back, and he heard Sayori fall too. *So much for catching me.*

They stood, shivering. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs it so cold all of a sudden?‚Äù he said. For being a vent covering, it lead to a rather spacious area. It felt more like a hallway than a tight, cramped vent shaft. 

She clung to him, seeming to forget that they were still in fact being pursued. And their pursuers had made landfall down below. The two immediately rushed on faster than they ever had. ‚ÄúSayori, your powers?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlmost there!‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúBut after this use I‚Äôll have to give it a rest for a longer while.‚Äù

They rushed until in the distance there was a wider space. The Sukimores had lost their ground a bit, giving them just a moment‚Äôs respite. But they needed to lose them somehow. If he recalled from the Beach incident, Suki had fooled them pretty easily. Maybe they could find a way like that. Just as they reached the clearing, and saw the pedestal at the center, the glass holding a certain peculiar object shattered, and a figure scurried off.

‚ÄúThat was the artifact?‚Äù Sayori said, not quite sure herself.

‚ÄúIf it was, we just witnessed robbery,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúAnd also, we‚Äôve got more important matters. We need to lose them, do you have any ideas?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy powers are back. Hold on.‚Äù She ate the last of her cookie, and the once frigid air became more smoldering than the desert above. She allowed him flight with her, and they floated to the ceiling, which was rather high, much like the rest of the space. Soon after, the flood of Sukimores came in, but they kept walking forward, not even batting an eye up. *That‚Äôll do it.*

When the footsteps receded, they both sighed, floating back down in relief. But it was short lived. A familiar shriek cut through the system.

‚ÄúMonika?‚Äù Sayori said.
~~~
BACK TO THE COFFEE SHOP‚Ä¶
~~~
The footsteps were growing louder by the second. No doubt, those were the Sukimores. Monika eyed Sunyori frantically, ‚ÄúI thought you got rid of them!‚Äù

She looked away, her face disappointed. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ There was a bit of a problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúApparently Natalie managed to grant that horde enhanced powers through the central console. All of my attacks bounced right back. It would‚Äôve seriously endangered Yuri and Natsuki.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat. Well now Michi is who knows where, and those things are getting even closer.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need to get out of here,‚Äù Mocha said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a safer way, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll find it. Follow me‚Äî‚Äù

Monika shrieked. The frontrunners had already reached, and one of them clung to her leg and bit her. She shook the Sukimore off, but they would only grow in numbers. ‚ÄúToo late!‚Äù she screamed.

Sunyori sighed, ‚ÄúI guess we‚Äôll have to do this the hard way. I‚Äôm granting you two flight, brace yourselves!‚Äù The dim coffee shop became brighter than the sun itself.

**DIRECTED‚Ä¶ SUNLIGHT LASER!!!!!**

A slim laser emitted from Sunyori‚Äôs forehead, aimed at one of the Sukimores. Just as she said, the hit bounced off the Sukimore, and redirected toward the trapdoor, flinging it wide open. Monika‚Äôs feet left the ground, and through the blinding sunlight she heard Mocha scream, but it was not of fear, but instead, of daring adventure. She smiled, knowing that through all the chaos, Mocha could find good and fun in it.

After what felt like several minutes, the immense sunlit world dimmed, and they were back on the surface, just outside of Akemi Forest. She recognized this crossroads.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a good distance away from the Sukimores for now,‚Äù Sunyori said, ‚ÄúI have a plan. I‚Äôm going to rise near the wormhole and try to get your friends‚Äô attention with my glow. Projectile hits don‚Äôt work on the Sukimores, but if you two could manage to find something to defend yourselves that would be good.‚Äù

The two watched as she drifted near the central wormhole. ‚ÄúUnderstood, Sunyori.‚Äù
~~~
MEANWHILE‚Ä¶
~~~
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre completely lost,‚Äù Nat lamented.

‚ÄúIt appears so‚Ä¶‚Äù Yuri eyed the hill in the distance. ‚ÄúOur aim is the wormhole. How have we managed to end up at the Reserves?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got me. Let‚Äôs try that again, we know most of these paths.‚Äù

‚ÄúHold on.‚Äù Yuri eyed a peculiar spot at the foot of the forest. 

Nat came to her side, but didn‚Äôt seem to see what she did. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe soil here‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs off.‚Äù

‚ÄúOff?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you not see it?‚Äù Yuri really scanned the spot. The soil was of a slightly lighter tint than the rest of it. It looked rather rectangular. A hidden entrance, perhaps.

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I should try‚Ä¶‚Äù Yuri crouched toward it‚Äî

And immediately was blown back, as the force of a thousand suns burst from the hole. Nat shrieked, hitting a tree. The two sat there, waiting out the chaos. At some point, a thousand pink masses came scurrying out, but they didn‚Äôt seem to spot them, instead making their way back through the forest. When everything had quieted down, Yuri breathed in, realizing she‚Äôd been holding her breath the whole time.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶‚Äù Nat choked.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Yuri whispered, ‚ÄúDo you see? That‚Äôs an entrance to somewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you crazy? I don‚Äôt wanna go down there! Not after that!‚Äù Nat said, staying perched by the tree. ‚ÄúSuit yourself. I‚Äôm staying out here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYuri? Nat? Is that your voice I hear?‚Äù someone said down there. A familiar voice.

‚ÄúOh great, there‚Äôs more to worry about.‚Äù Another familiar voice.

‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶?‚Äù Natsuki muttered, coming near the hole.

Yuri peeked in, to see an entire hideaway completely furnished, and still in surprisingly good condition for the sheer force that had exited it. And in the center of the candle-lit room, was Sayori and MC. Yuri entered, and waved for Nat to follow.

Once she did, Sayori immediately rushed forth and enveloped both of them in a tight hug. ‚ÄúI was so worried about you two!‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúJeez, I get it. We‚Äôre okay.‚Äù Nat said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you two are still well,‚Äù Yuri said, hugging back.

‚ÄúYeah, well, we‚Äôre in a bit of a situation right now,‚Äù MC said.

Sayori pulled back and returned to his side. Between the four, a familiar purple haired chibi stood, caught red handed with a console behind her back. Not that hiding it there would help, Yuri had a clear sight of it.

‚ÄúGive me a break,‚Äù Michi said, ‚ÄúI just did you guys a favor.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike hell you did,‚Äù MC said, ‚ÄúSayori says that was an artifact Suki and Yulia were looking for. You‚Äôre a thief!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is going on here?‚Äù Yuri inquired.

‚ÄúYou better not screw us over again,‚Äù Nat folded her arms. 

Sayori stared at Michi, keen and cautious. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you steal it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it to you?‚Äù

by Asma bint Shameem 

üîπ *1. Once a person dies, they should close his eyes.*

üìå*Proof*:

üçÉUmm Salamah said:  

""The Messenger of Allaah Ô∑∫ came to see Abu Salamah when his sight had become fixed (he had passed away). 

So the Prophet Ô∑∫ closed his eyes and said: 'When the soul is seized and it leaves the body, the eyes follow it.‚Äù (Muslim)

üîπ *2. Those present should make duaa and say only that which is good.* 

üìå *Proof:*

üçÉWhen Abu Salamah died, some of his family wept and wailed. So the Prophet sal Allaahu Alayhi wa sallam said: 

‚ÄúPray to Allaah only for good for yourselves, because the angels (who are present) say ""Ameen"" to whatever you utter.' 

Then he said: 'O Allaah! Forgive Abu Salamah; raise his station among those who are rightly-guided; and take good care of his family that he has left behind. O Lord of the Worlds! Forgive him and us, make his grave spacious, and put light therein for him.""   (Muslim and others)  

So we can make the same duaa:

ÿßŸÑŸÑŸáŸèŸÄŸÖŸêŸë ÿßÿ∫ŸíŸÅŸêŸÄÿ±Ÿí ŸÑŸêŸÄŸÅŸÑÿßŸÜ (ÿ®ÿßÿ≥ŸÄŸÖŸá) ŸàŸéÿßÿ±ŸíŸÅŸéÿπŸí ÿØŸéÿ±Ÿéÿ¨Ÿéÿ™ŸéŸÄŸáŸè ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖŸéŸáŸíŸÄÿØŸêŸäŸäŸÄŸÜ ÿå  ŸàŸéÿßÿÆŸíŸÄŸÑŸèŸÅŸíŸÄŸáŸè ŸÅŸä ÿπŸéŸÇŸêŸÄÿ®ŸêŸáŸê ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿßÿ®ŸêŸÄÿ±ŸäŸÜÿå  ŸàŸéÿßÿ∫ŸíŸÅŸêŸÄÿ±Ÿí ŸÑŸéŸÜŸÄÿß ŸàŸéŸÑŸéŸÄŸáŸè Ÿäÿß ÿ±Ÿéÿ®ŸéŸë ÿßŸÑÿπŸÄÿßŸÑŸéŸÖŸÄŸäŸÜÿå ŸàŸéÿßŸÅŸíÿ≥ŸéŸÄÿ≠Ÿí ŸÑŸéŸáŸè ŸÅŸä ŸÇŸéÿ®ŸíŸÄÿ±ŸêŸáŸê ŸàŸéŸÜŸéŸÄŸàŸêŸëÿ±Ÿí ŸÑŸéŸáŸè ŸÅŸäŸá

Allaahumma‚Äôghfir li (name of the person)  warfa` darajatahu fi ‚Äòl-mahdiyyeen, wakhlufhu fƒ´ `aqibihi fi ‚Äòl-ghaabireen,  wagh‚Äôfir-lanaa wa lahu yaa Rabba ‚Äòl-‚Äòaalameen,  wafsa·∏• lahu fee qabrihi wa nawwir lahu feeh. 

O Allaah, forgive [name of the person] and elevate his station among those who are guided. 
Send him along the path of those who came before, and forgive us and him, O Lord of the worlds. 
Enlarge for him his grave, and shed light upon him in it.‚Äù 
(Saheeh Muslim 2/634)

üîπ *3. The deceased should be washed and shrouded*

Basically washing the deceased male or female is through the following steps. 
It can be done this way or any other way as long as water reaches all over the body and nothing remains dry. 

a. First cover the body with a sheet so that it's not exposed. 

b. Put on gloves and wash the private parts by pouring water over the area. 

c. Do wudhu for the person who passed away like we make wudhu. 
Wipe over the mouth and nose with water, wash the face and arms, wipe the head and ears, and wash the feet. 

d. Mix water with some lote tree leaves (sidr) and pour this water over the head, then over the right side, then over the left side, then pour water all over the body. 
If lote tree leaves are not available then we can use soap etc.

e. Repeat this three times or if needed five or seven. 
It's better to do it an odd number of times. 

f. When washing for the last time, it's good to add camphor to the water to add some pleasant fragrance. 

g. Next braid the woman's hair into 3 braids 

h. Shroud the deceased and apply camphor as perfume to the body. 

üîπ *4. They should hasten to bury the deceased and not wait too long for relatives etc to arrive from overseas.* 

üìå *Proof:*

üçÉThe Prophet Ô∑∫ said:

 ‚ÄòHasten to bury the deceased, for if he was righteous, then you are taking him to something good, and if he was otherwise, then it is an evil of which you are relieving yourselves.‚Äù (al-Bukhaari, Muslim) 

üîπ *5. It‚Äôs allowed for the wife to wash her husband and the husband to wash his wife.* 

üìå*Proof:*

üçÉ Our Mother Aaishah radhi Allaahu anhaa said:

‚ÄúThe Messenger of Allaah Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam came back from a funeral in al-Baqee‚Äò and I had a headache and was saying, Oh my head. 

He said, ‚ÄúRather, I should say, Oh my head. It will not matter if you die before me, for I will wash you and shroud you, then I will offer the funeral prayer for you and bury you.‚Äù (Ahmad, 25380; Ibn Maajah, 1456; saheeh by al-Albaani)

üçÉ Ash-Shawkaani said: 

‚ÄúThe words of the Prophet sal Allaahu Alayhi wa sallam, ‚Äúfor I will wash you‚Äù, indicate that a wife may be washed by her husband if she dies.‚Äù (Nayl al-Awtaar, 4/35)

üçÉ Shaikh ibn Baaz said:

‚ÄúIt is OK for a woman to wash her husband if she is knows how to do that. ‚ÄòAli radhi Allaahu anhu  washed his wife Fatimah radhi Allaahu anhaa and Asmaa bint ‚ÄòUmays washed her husband Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq radhi Allaahu anhu.‚Äù 
(Majmoo‚Äô Fataawa Wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi‚Äôah Li Samaahat Vol. 13, P. 107)

üîπ *6. It‚Äôs preferred that the face is covered after death* 
But it‚Äôs PERMISSIBLE to uncover it and see his face if the family wants to see it. 
And it could be both before as well as after shrouding. 
But the face should not be uncovered once the body is placed in the grave. 

As for a woman, it‚Äôs better to cover her face and only her mahrams can see it if they want to do that. 

üìå *Proof:*

üçÉ Abu Bakr radhi Allaahu anhu kissed the face of the Prophet Ô∑∫ after his death and some Sahaabah (for example Jaabir radhi Allaahu anhu) saw the face of  their deceased loved ones to kiss them and the Prophet Ô∑∫ did not stop them from looking and uncovering their face. 

üçÉ Ibn Qudaamah said: 

‚ÄúIf his family want to see him, they should not be prevented. That is because of the report from Jaabir who said: 
‚ÄúWhen my father was killed, I started to lift the cloth from his face whilst I was weeping, and the Prophet Ô∑∫ did not forbid me to do that.‚Äù
And Aa‚Äôishah radhi Allaahu anhaa 
said: 
‚ÄúI saw the Messenger of Allaah Ô∑∫  kiss ‚ÄòUthmaan ibn Maz‚Äòoon after he died, and I even saw his tears flowing. 

And she said: 
‚ÄúAbu Bakr came to see the Prophet Ô∑∫ when he was wrapped in a striped cloak [after he died]. He uncovered his face, then he leaned over him and kissed him, then he wept and said: May my father be sacrificed for you, O Prophet of Allaah; Allaah will not cause you to die twice.‚ÄùThese hadiths are saheeh.‚Äù
(al-Mughni (2/350) 

üîπ *7. There should be no wailing, screaming or lamenting for the dead.* 

üìå *Proof:*

üçÉ The Prophet Ô∑∫ said:

‚ÄúThere are four things in my ummah from the jaahiliyyah which they will not give up: pride in one‚Äôs ancestry, slandering the lineage of others, seeking rain from the stars and wailing over the dead. If the woman who wails does not repent before she dies, she will be raised on the Day of Resurrection wearing a garment of tar and a shirt of scabs.‚Äô (Muslim al-Janaa‚Äôiz, 1550). 

üîπ *8. There‚Äôs no need to wear black or special clothes for mourning.* 
Rather any ordinary clothes can be worn. 

üçÉShaikh Ibn Uthaymeen said:

‚ÄúWearing black at times of calamity is a wrong custom that has no basis‚Äù (Majallah Al-Da‚Äôwah, No. 1789, P. 60)

üîπ *9. You can throw three handful of dirt when burying the deceased.* 
That‚Äôs what the Prophet Ô∑∫ did. 

üçÉ Abu Hurayrah Radhi Allaahu anhu said:

‚ÄúOnce, the Messenger of Allaah  Ô∑∫ performed the funeral prayer on a deceased (Muslim) and then came to his grave and threw three handfuls of dirt at the direction of his head.‚Äù (Ibn Maajah: Saheeh)

üçÉ Ibn Qudaamah said : 

‚ÄúIt is narrated from Ahmad that he attended a funeral procession and, when earth was put over the dead, he stood toward the grave and threw three handfuls of dirt on it and then returned to his place and said, commenting: ‚ÄòThis is handed down from ‚ÄòAli in an authentic narration, that he threw handfuls of dirt on the grave of Ibn Mukaffaf.‚Äù
(Al-Mughni)

But keep in mind that there‚Äôs no proof of any dhikr or duaa to be said  when throwing dirt. 
Anything that you hear regarding that is not proven from the authentic sources. 

üîπ *10. Nothing should be read of the Qur‚Äôaan.* 

There‚Äôs NO PROOF that Surah al-Faatihah or Yaseen or any other part of the Qur‚Äôaan be read for the dying or deceased. 
Rather we should make duaa for the  deceased. 

üìå *Proof:*

üçÉ Shaikh Ibn Baaz said regarding reading Qur‚Äôaan for the deceased:

‚ÄúThere is NO REPORT in the Holy Qur‚Äôaan or in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah Sal Allaahu Alaiyhi wa Sallam, or from his companions to indicate that it is prescribed to give one's reading of Qur‚Äôaan (or the reward thereof) to one's parents or to anyone else. 
Rather Allaah has enjoined reading Qur‚Äôaan so that one may BENEFIT from it, LEARN from it, PONDER its meanings and ACT upon it.
If giving the reward for reading to another was permissible or prescribed, the righteous salaf would have done it. 
*It is NOT PERMISSIBLE to make ANALOGIES with regard to acts of worship, because they can ONLY be proven by a text from the Book of Allaah Subhaanahu wa Ta‚Äôaala or the Sunnah of His Prophet Ô∑∫*, because of the hadeeth quoted above and other similar reports.‚Äù
(Majmoo‚Äô Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 8/360, 361)

üîπ *11. Duaa should be made for the deceased INDIVIDUALLY and NOT collectively in a group.* 

There‚Äôs no proof from the practice of the Prophet Ô∑∫ that he or his Sahaabah ever got together as an ‚Äòorganized‚Äô event to offer duaa collectively after anyone passed away. 

When someone amongst them passed away, the Prophet Ô∑∫ and his Sahaabah would bury them then the Prophet Ô∑∫ would encourage them to make duaa for the deceased. 

However, they did so INDIVIDUALLY. 

And NOT as a group. 

üçÉ Uthmaan ibn ‚ÄòAffaan radhi Allaahu anhu said: 

‚ÄúWhen the Prophet Ô∑∫ had finished burying a deceased person, he would stand over him and say: ‚ÄúPray for forgiveness for your brother, and ask that he be made steadfast, for he is being questioned now.‚Äù (Abu Dawood - saheeh by al-Albaani)

üçÉ Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen was asked about gathering together to make duaa as a group when someone dies. 

He said:

‚ÄúThis is not part of the Sunnah of the Messenger Ô∑∫ or the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs (may Allaah be pleased with them), rather the Messenger Ô∑∫ used to tell them to pray for forgiveness for the deceased and ask for him to be made steadfast, INDIVIDUALLY and not together.‚Äù (Fataawa al-Janaa‚Äôiz, p. 228)

üîπ *12.Gathering at the masjid or at the house to receive condolences?*

There‚Äôs a difference of opinion among the scholars about that. 

Some of the scholars including Shaykh Ibn ‚ÄòUthaymeen are of the view that it‚Äôs not allowed to gather at a specific place to receive condolences because that was not the practice of the Prophet Ô∑∫. 

But other scholars including Shaykh Ibn Baaz said that it is permissible to receive condolences in this way. 

üçÉShaykh Ibn Baaz said: 

‚ÄúI do not see anything wrong with the one who has suffered the calamity of the death of a relative or wife and the like receiving people in his house who have come to offer condolences at an appropriate time, because offering condolences is Sunnah, and receiving those who have come to offer condolences is something that helps them to fulfil the Sunnah. 
And if they honor them by offering coffee or tea or perfume, all of that is fine.‚Äú
(Majmoo‚Äò Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi‚Äòah, 13/373)

üçÉShaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtaar ash-Shanqeeti explained the difference of opinion and said: 

‚ÄúThe salaf (early generations) disallowed that, and Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) was very strict on this matter and disallowed it. 
That was the way of the salaf, but later scholars and fuqaha‚Äô issued fatwas stating that there is nothing wrong with it in these later times. 

The reason for that is that in earlier times people were few and it was possible to see the family of the deceased in the masjid, or on the road or at the well, and offer condolences to them, and the matter was easy. 
In fact you could say that if a person died, all the people of the village would know and would attend his burial, and offering condolences was easy. 

But nowadays many people live in big cities and it is difficult to go to each relative in his own house; this causes such difficulty the extent of which only Allaah knows, and the matter is burdensome. Hence if they gather in the house of one of the relatives, that is easier for the people and easier for them, and it is more effective in achieving the purpose of offering condolences to all and consoling them all. 
Hence they issued fatwas stating that in this case there is nothing wrong with them sitting (to receive condolences) and this is not regarded as coming under the heading of wailing (which is forbidden); rather it is prescribed because there is a *need* for it.‚Äù
(Silsilat Duroos Sharh az-Zaad 86/16). 

üîπ *13. No soyum (third day),10th day or 40th day or anniversary celebrations* 

There‚Äôs NO PROOF from the Sharee‚Äôah of holding gatherings of reading the Qur‚Äôaan for the deceased on the third day or tenth day or fortieth day or anniversary etc. 

Many people died in the lifetime of the Prophet Ô∑∫.
But he never held such gatherings. 
And neither did the Sahaabah. 

If it was good then surely they would have done it. 
But they didn‚Äôt. 

üîπ *14. Family and neighbors should bring the food* 

üìå *Proof:*

üçÉ When Ja‚Äôfar radhi Allaahu anhu was killed, the Prophet Ô∑∫ went to his family and said: 

‚ÄúThe family of Ja‚Äôfar are busy with the matter of their deceased, so prepare food for them.‚Äô (Ibn Majah - hasan by al-Albaani)

üçÉ Shaikh ibn Baaz said:

‚ÄúIt is not permitted for the family to (especially) make food for people because for the sake of the deceased. 

This is one of the actions of the Jaahiliyyah, whether it is done on the day of the death, or on the fourth or tenth day after the death, or at the new year. All of that is not permitted.

But if guests come to the family of the deceased during the mourning period, there is nothing wrong with them making food for them for the sake of hospitality, and there is nothing wrong with the household inviting whoever they want of their neighbors and relatives to eat with them from the food that has been given to them.‚Äù (Majmoo‚Äô Fataawa)

üîπ *15. No putting the Mus-haf (the Qur‚Äôaan book) on the dead body or covering the bier with a cloth that has Aayaat or la ilaaha illallaah or other Surahs written on it.* 

üçÉ Shaikh ibn Baaz said:

‚ÄúThis should not be done, and we should warn against that, because that exposes the Qur‚Äôaanic verses to inappropriate treatment, and because some people may think that this will benefit the deceased, which is a serious mistake for which there is no basis in sharee‚Äôah.‚Äù  (Majallat Al-Buhooth Al-Islamiyyah, 68/36, 37)

üîπ *16. When to offer condolences?*

Condolences can be offered at ANY time. 
There‚Äôs no specific time limit for doing that. 

üçÉ Shaikh Ibn Baaz said:

‚ÄúWith regard to offering condolences, there are no set days for doing so. 
It is prescribed from the time that the soul leaves the body, before the funeral prayer and afterwards. There is no time limit set for that in sharee‚Äôah. 
Condolences may be offered at night or during the day, in the home, on the street, in the masjid, in the graveyard or anywhere else.‚Äù

You did give me the final goodbye, however, there was some closure left to be made with the place and the memories. So I went to complete a full circle today. 

I went and sat at the same tables and chairs, both downstairs and at the rooftop. Had the same coffee and potato cheese garlic. Interacted with the same host. But all without you. You were not there, but the memories were. I could remember everything you said or did in the nooks and corners of the Cafe.  I did not shut them away, I felt them and tried to let them go, by bereaving. The fireplace, represents exactly my heart, simmering and burning away into ashes. Somehow maybe the host knew, he played 'mai rahoon ya na rahoon' and 'suna suna', not the songs I wished for. Tears that were due, were shed, a crying session done well. 

The last one month, seems I have not been me, over-reacting on things, being sour, over-sharing on social media (like right now). Re-revising our old chats, switching in between heartbreak and self love subs on reddit. I need to turn inwards now. 

Your first message was on reddit, and from a query I posted on this sub about the theatre! Only fair I made a fairwell post on this sub. Yes, one does find real people in this sub as well, however I can't vouch for the longevity of the relationships build here. It was the strongest I ever loved anyone, in my life, but mine did not last. 

And when I left the cafe, I left you there. You have started a new chapter in your life, it is high time, I turn the next page too. I hope, no, I am determined, this is the last time, I spoke of you to anyone, and visited bits of you. I let you go, and I set myself free from this pain. 

Alexa, end this 'Tamasha' and switch from 'Heer to badi sad hai' to 'Ja Ranjhan Ranjhan, heer ne tenu chhod dia' 

P.S. the Cafe \[Badnaam Bawarchi\]  is really beautiful, good food, a private theatre too I guess. However it was my last visit there:).

I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don‚Äôt work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I‚Äôve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy.

1k8eoke,https://www.reddit.com/r/copenhagen/comments/1k8eoke/the_final_solution_to_liquid_limestone/,The Final Solution to Liquid Limestone,"Hi fellow Copenhageners!

A month or so ago I spotted a post by a fellow city slicker in this sub introducing me to the term ""liquid limestone"", which resonated pretty much 100% with the daily struggle we found ourselves in after buying a house here in the city 2 years ago.

I knew the water was hard, but I fully underestimated just how much it affects anything that it touches: dishwasher, laundry machine, coffee maker, kettle, every tap/sink, wine glasses, pots & pans, tiles (especially the grout), glass shower doors, and even the bloody hose to water plants barely has any flow anymore due to the kalk buildup. We've spent an ungodly amount of kroner and timer scrubbing all our shit to within an inch of its life.

So a few weeks ago we decided we were done with this. The benefits of less cleaning (products), longer lives for our appliances and our aging water heater, less irritated scalp/wiry and dry hair... for us it was worth the investment. Especially because Hofor tells me the hardness in our neighborhood (currently 12-24dH) won't be reduced to 10-12dH until 2031 (Vanl√∏se).

We got a water softner, 50kg of salt tablets, and a plumber who claimed he had installed a similar system before. He couldn't do anything about the deposits already present in our house's piping so the water pressure, which is currently just about adequate, won't improve. However it shouldn't continue to worsen either going forward.

He had to extend some of the ~40 year old plumbing to hook up the system and the inside of those pipes was basically 50% brown, callus-like deposits. I try not to think about our drinking water running through those pipes too much.

The bl√∏dg√∏ringsanl√¶g came with a test kit, which indicated water hardness in the days leading up to the installation varied between 20-22dH, in line with what Hofor reports. After the system was set up, performed its first rinse, and was dialed in, we now have 4-6dH.

That was a week ago. We've done a ""kalk campaign"" to get rid of every bit of limescale we could get to (very satisfying knowing it's supposed to be the last time!). So far none of the scale has returned. Would recommend.

Anyone have tips for restoring discoloured grout between tiles? Citronsyre is doing an amazing job elsewhere but I won't risk throwing that on our tiles because it could discolor them even more...

Let me know if you have any questions about the setup or the system - happy to discuss!",12,1745678981.0,copenhagen,11,0.93,False

My husband and I will be on our first Princess cruise the week after Thanksgiving this year (6-day on the Majestic Princess) and we are in a Reserve Collection Mini-Suite. We also both have the Premier package. We just started cruising last November and since we've been on 3 NCL cruises with another planned in July, so this will also be our first experience with a line that's not NCL (which we've been loving!).

I have a few questions about these things for anyone who might have insight:

1. It says Reserve dining for the MDR, but it looks like Majestic has three MDRs? Is Reserve available for all three or which one has the Reserve dining?

2. If you've sailed with Premier and Reserve, how have you balanced specialty dining with Reserve dining? I was thinking to maybe do the earliest reservation for specialty, and head to Reserve for dessert/coffee later in the night. I'm starting to think Reserve was not necessary with Premier, but the room was exactly what we wanted (M107) and we are fans of specialty dining and higher end spirits.

3. How many formal nights can we expect on a 6-day cruise? It's shorter so I'd think maybe one or two, or is every night formal? And how formal is formal? Are floor length gowns and ties required, or are sport coats and nice maxi dresses okay?

4. Anything else I should know about the dining on Princess?

I am unsure if this is HI, food intolerance or leaky gut causing a immune system flair. 

Never had any issues prior. Diet tends to exacerbate them - gluten, beans, coffee, chocolate. Also intense exercise and Vit B6 makes it go crazy.

Now:

I had food allergy and IgG tests done - negative

Dao enzyne tests - normal

Gut biome test showed low levels of bifido & lacto.

This makes me lean towards leaky gut as the culprit. But was wondering if anyone can help me with how to think about this and perhaps share your own experince. Thank you.

**hdfidelity presents**     
     
### **The Herdsmen**     
     
### **Scene One: A Soft Start**

*Dusk rolled out across the plain, painting everything the color of old pennies. The sky held its breath. A fire crackled low, hardly enough heat to cook by, but they were used to that.*

**Skeeter** sat cross-legged by the fire, whittling a stick down to nothing much.  
**Cutter** leaned back against his saddle, hat tilted low, chewing a blade of dry grass.  
**Dusty** stirred the pot with a bent spoon, humming tunelessly.  
**Hoss** stared out into the distance, like he could will cloud shapes into being if he squinted hard enough.

They hadn't spoken in a while. The pot bubbled. The prairie stretched out quiet and wide.

Finally, Skeeter said, low and lazy,  
> ""We must be close now.""

Dusty looked up, hopeful.  
> ""You figure?""

Skeeter shrugged like it hurt his shoulders to move.  
> ""Stars are right. Smell‚Äôs right. Air‚Äôs got that look to it.""

Cutter snorted, pushing his hat up with a knuckle.  
> ""Air don't *look,* Skeeter. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs air.""

Skeeter didn‚Äôt bother arguing. He tapped his stick once against a rock and set it down.  
> ""When you know, you know.""

Hoss, still staring at nothing, said,  
> ""Herd's just over the ridge. Feel it in my bones.""

They all turned and looked at the dark shape of the ridgeline. Nothing moved. Nothing ever did.

Dusty, still stirring, ventured,  
> ""Maybe... maybe they're just real quiet.""

Silence lapped around them like warm water.

Cutter yawned without covering his mouth and said,  
> ""Yeah. Real quiet. Just like last week. And the week before. And the week before that.""

Dusty frowned, scraping the bottom of the pot.  
> ""This time's different. I can feel it in my bones.""

Nobody agreed. Nobody disagreed.

The fire popped. A spark drifted up and blinked out.

Skeeter reached for his battered tin cup, sipped, grimaced.  
> ""Coffee tastes like horse sweat.""

Cutter stretched out long and slow.  
> ""That's how you know it's working.""

They settled back into the hush, each one secretly watching the ridge, willing something‚Äîanything‚Äîto move.

Somewhere in the dark, a coyote barked once.  
It could've been a cow, if you squinted hard enough.

---


### **Scene Two: Tracks in the Riverbed**

*Morning scraped itself raw across the land. Pale light. Long shadows. The air already had that dry, ticking feeling to it, like something waiting to crack.*

The four of them rode slow down into the belly of an old riverbed, their horses picking careful steps over cracked mud and white stones.

Dusty pointed from the saddle.  
> ""Tracks,"" he said, excited.

They all reined up and looked.

There *were* marks in the dust.  
Long, shallow impressions. Some deep punctures.  
Something had passed through here, that was sure.

Skeeter swung down from his horse with a grunt, crouched low. Studied the signs like a priest reading cracked bones.

Cutter stayed up top, squinting.  
> ""Could be elk.""

Dusty leaned forward, hopeful.  
> ""Could be cows.""

Cutter grunted.  
> ""Could be stone.""

Skeeter ran a finger along one of the prints, feeling the brittle ridges.

Hoss finally spoke, voice steady and certain:  
> ""Herd.""

Skeeter nodded, serious.  
> ""Herd, alright.""

Dusty's face lit up like Christmas morning.

Cutter spit into the dust.  
> ""Ain't no cows walk bow-legged like that.""

Skeeter stood, dusting his knees.  
> ""You ever *seen* a migratin' cow, Cutter?""

Cutter opened his mouth, closed it again.  
After a beat:  
> ""No.""

> ""Then don't tell me how they walk.""

The horses shifted, stamping at invisible flies. Somewhere up the riverbed, a hot breeze stirred up a little devil of dust that danced in place before collapsing.

Hoss pointed upriver, silent.  
Without another word, they clicked their reins and set off at a steady trot, following the faint, impossible trail.

The sun climbed.  
The riverbed narrowed into nothingness.

The tracks, like always, faded with it.

But by then, it didn‚Äôt matter.  
They were already too far along to turn back.

---  


### **Scene Three: The Drifter**

They caught sight of him just past noon.  
A thin figure on a mule, rocking slow against the horizon like a ship on a dying sea.

They didn‚Äôt hurry to meet him. Nobody hurried out here.

When they finally crossed paths, the drifter pulled up, tipped his hat.  
His clothes were the same color as the land‚Äîdust over dust.  
His face was creased like an old map left out in the rain.

They all nodded, polite-like.

Skeeter spoke first.  
> ""You seen a herd come through this way?""

The drifter scratched his chin, thoughtful.  
> ""I've seen a lot of make it's way out this way."" he said.  

Cutter squinted, already annoyed.  
> ""Out with it, drifter.""

The drifter shrugged, loose and slow.  
> ""Depends what you mean by herd.""

Dusty leaned forward, eager.  
> ""Cows. About yay high.""  
He gestured broadly, maybe a bit taller than an actual cow.  
> ""Brown ones. White ones. Big.""

The drifter nodded, considering.  
> ""Yeah,"" he said.  
> ""Saw a bunch of somethings.""

Skeeter stiffened a little.  
> ""Somethings?""

The drifter looked up at the blank sky, like he was picking words from a clothesline.  
> ""Had hooves, sure enough. But... long necks. Some of 'em had wings. Big ol' eyes, blinkin' slow like moons.""

Silence.

Dusty‚Äôs mouth opened and closed.

Cutter said flatly,  
> ""You‚Äôre describin' buffaloes, friend.""

The drifter smiled thinly.  
> ""Maybe I am. Maybe I ain't.""

Hoss, who hadn‚Äôt said a word, leaned forward in the saddle and asked,  
> ""Which way they go?""

The drifter pointed upriver, back the way they‚Äôd come.  
> ""Thataway. Or maybe... thataway.""  
He swung his arm wide in a lazy arc that covered an acute band of the compass.

They all looked where he pointed.  
Nothing but flat land, sky, and memory.

When they looked back, the drifter was already riding off, slow and steady, into the heat shimmer.

Dusty said, quietly,  
> ""Think he‚Äôs touched in the head.""

Cutter watched the man shrink to a blur.  
> ""Takes one to find one.""

Skeeter reached down, picked up a pebble, and tossed it into the dust.  
> ""Long necks or not, we're headin' west.""

Hoss nodded like a man sealing a contract.  
> ""Herd's waitin'.""

They spurred their horses gently and moved on, the dust swallowing their trail almost before it was made.

The sun burned steady overhead.  
The herd, as ever, remained just a little further along.

---  


### **Scene Four: Campfire Tall Tales**

*The night folded down over the plains, deep and heavy. Stars clung to the sky like old nails hammered into a barn door. The fire popped and sighed, throwing weak light against a ring of boots and crossed legs.*

Dusty crouched close, scratching a picture into the dirt with a twig.

> ""Figure if a cow had wings,"" he said, ""they‚Äôd be stubby. Like a chicken‚Äôs.""

Skeeter sipped his coffee, grimaced, and said,  
> ""Chicken can‚Äôt fly worth a damn.""

Dusty nodded, serious.  
> ""Neither would a cow. Just enough to... flap a little. Maybe glide downhill.""

Cutter leaned over to look at the drawing.  
It was a cow, more or less, but lopsided and sad, with tiny wings sticking out of its shoulders.

He snorted.  
> ""That's the ugliest thing I ever seen.""

Dusty sat back, proud anyway.  
> ""Might be the only kind of cow tough enough to make it out here.""

Hoss stirred the fire with a stick, sending a curl of sparks into the dark.  
> ""Wouldn‚Äôt matter none,"" he said, voice low.  
> ""Still good eatin'.""

They all considered that in silence for a while.  
The idea of roast winged cow hung heavy in the smoke between them.

Skeeter leaned back on his elbows, staring up at the stars.  
> ""Bet their milk‚Äôs different,"" he said.  
> ""Floaty, like.""

Dusty grinned, wide and foolish.  

Cutter rolled his eyes so hard you could hear it.  
> ""You‚Äôre all touched.""

Nobody argued.  
There was no hurry out here to get anywhere sane.

The fire burned lower.  
The cold crept in, gentle but sure.  
One by one, they pulled their coats tighter around themselves, heads tipping back, eyes half-closed.

Somewhere out there in the black, a night bird called once, twice.  
Maybe it was a bird.  
Maybe it was a cow.  
Maybe it was something else entirely.

The fire crackled on.

1k8ek6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Smdey/comments/1k8ek6j/how_langup_makes_language_learning_easy_for/,How LangUp Makes Language Learning Easy for Beginners,"https://preview.redd.it/157bny0cy6xe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=34b712e57f7cedde093ee233ba6ce71f909fdbbe

Learning a new language shouldn‚Äôt feel like climbing Mount Everest. Yet for many of us, that‚Äôs exactly what traditional language learning methods feel like‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääintimidating textbooks, endless vocabulary lists, and complex grammar rules that leave us more confused than confident.

As an Android developer with a passion for both education and technology, I witnessed this struggle firsthand. This observation sparked a question that would eventually lead to LangUp: Why are most language apps either overwhelming for beginners or failing to focus on practical communication?

# The Birth of¬†LangUp

That question became my mission. I wanted to create language learning tools that beginners could stick with‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääapps that were approachable, engaging, and genuinely effective.

LangUp emerged from this vision: a brand built on helping people actually use a language, not just study it. Every app we develop centers around clear, actionable lessons you can apply immediately, without getting lost in linguistic complexities or memorizing words you‚Äôll rarely use.

# The LangUp Ecosystem

Today, LangUp offers a growing collection of beginner-friendly language learning apps that prioritize communication, comprehension, and real-world application:

LangUp: English for Beginners

Designed to help learners build strong English skills quickly and confidently, perfect for beginners, travelers, students, and professionals alike.

LangUp: French for Beginners

Makes mastering French accessible for anyone starting from scratch, ideal for beginners, travelers, and students passionate about the French language and culture.

LangUp: Spanish for Beginners

Enables absolute beginners to speak and understand Spanish with confidence, perfect for travelers, casual learners, and business professionals.

LangUp: German for Beginners

Helps learners quickly grasp German essentials for real-world communication, especially valuable for those preparing for travel, studies, or work in German-speaking countries.

LangUp: Italian for Beginners

Simplifies learning Italian through engaging, practical lessons designed specifically for new learners, travelers, and those exploring Italian culture.

# Features That Transform Learning

What makes LangUp different isn‚Äôt just our beginner-first philosophy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs how we‚Äôve implemented that philosophy through thoughtfully designed features:

üìö Vocabulary Builder

Our vocabulary system uses scientifically proven spaced repetition techniques that help you remember new words faster and retain them longer. Rather than overwhelming you with thousands of words, we focus on high-frequency vocabulary that native speakers use daily.

üéß Immersive Listening Practice

Learning to understand a language as it‚Äôs naturally spoken is often the biggest hurdle for beginners. Our listening exercises feature authentic pronunciations and natural speech patterns, gradually building your confidence in real-world scenarios.

‚úçÔ∏è Interactive Writing Exercises

Writing reinforces memory pathways that speaking and listening alone don‚Äôt activate. Our interactive writing quizzes help you master spelling and grammar intuitively, through practice rather than rote memorization.

üéÆ Learning Through Play

We‚Äôve gamified the learning process with activities like Vocabulary Quiz, Reading Challenge, Memory Match, and Writing Practice. These games transform repetitive practice into engaging challenges that keep you motivated and coming back for more.

üìù Practical Conversation Skills

Instead of teaching obscure phrases you‚Äôll never use, we focus on high-utility expressions and conversation patterns. From your very first lesson, you‚Äôll learn a language you can apply in daily interactions.

# The LangUp Advantage

What truly sets LangUp apart in the crowded language-learning market?

Beginner-Focused Design

Everything about our apps‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom the interface to the lesson progression‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwas built with beginners in mind. We eliminate unnecessary complexity and focus exclusively on what new learners need most.

Practical Over Theoretical

We emphasize real communication over academic perfection. While other apps might drill you into the subjunctive mood before you can confidently order coffee, we prioritize functional language skills that give you immediate results.

Engagement Through Enjoyment

Learning happens best when it doesn‚Äôt feel like work. Our carefully crafted games and activities make language acquisition feel less like studying and more like play.

Flexible Learning Experience

With offline support and bite-sized lessons, LangUp fits seamlessly into your life. Learn during your commute, lunch break, or whenever you have a few spare minutes.

Science-Backed Methodology

Our approach isn‚Äôt just intuitive‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs informed by cognitive science and language acquisition research. Features like spaced repetition aren‚Äôt just convenient; they‚Äôre proven to enhance long-term retention.

# Join the LangUp Community.

If you‚Äôre ready to break through the barriers that have kept you from mastering a new language, LangUp provides the ideal starting point. Whether you‚Äôre interested in English, French, Spanish, German, or Italian, our apps offer a refreshingly accessible path to fluency.

Getting off of Temura had been a whirlwind, as we‚Äôd grabbed Hirri and bolted out to a waiting vehicle. The car sped off to the landing pad to retrieve our spaceship; I wondered whether we should try to rescue more civilians. Back at the resort, Vanare had seemed distraught about leaving his family *and* panicked about being carried on foot at such high speeds. I felt a little bad for the chef, noticing that he was frantically texting again. It was already going to be a tight fit, but surely we could squeeze in a few more tiny birds? However, this wasn‚Äôt the only craft on the planet, and I was in a *bit* of a hurry.

Suffice to say, the running and the spicy food pushed me to some hasty bathroom trips once we got to the spacecraft. We should *not* have gone running at those speeds right after eating those firebombs. Once the urgency of my internal processes was addressed, I could turn my attention to the frightened birds. I didn‚Äôt want anything to happen to the Derandi. It was obvious they didn‚Äôt believe that we sought an honest friendship.¬†

*I saw some explosions in the distance, and I‚Äôm hopeful Larimak will get his ass beat just like at Jorlen. We did the right thing to save these Derandi civilians, I hope. Jetti and Vanare are petrified of us, but we couldn‚Äôt just leave a mother and a sick child, as well as a culinary mastermind and loving father, behind.*

I hoped this wasn‚Äôt humanity‚Äôs future: aliens being afraid of us like a coffee barista listening to a customer order a half-soy, half-nightshade milk macchiato with twenty pumps of low-fat syrup and fifteen shots of espresso put into whipped cream, shaken but not stirred. We were not all maniacs to be appeased.¬†

‚ÄúNo, no.‚Äù Vanare stared at the faint orange flashes from the system‚Äôs fringes, which I suspected were from Larimak‚Äôs weaponry; at least the incendiary strikes were far off from the planet‚Äôs circumference. ‚ÄúI cannot bear not knowing what‚Äôs happening to my wife and children. Why take me away? Why did you do this?‚Äù

Sofia bit her lower lip. ‚ÄúWe just tried to save the people in our immediate vicinity. You can trust humans to protect the Derandi with all of our hearts. I was horrified that Larimak threatened Jetti for the crime of hearing us out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would you care at all? You‚Äôve been to Temura once! You are‚Ä¶above us.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you knew how we thought about you, finding aliens in general, you wouldn‚Äôt say this. We have so much to learn and share with you. Humanity has been alone while you‚Äôve had all of Caelum; you‚Äôve seen so much. Everything we knew a year ago was erroneous and wrong. You are above us in knowledge of many things, and that‚Ä¶is humbling.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo some people,‚Äù I remarked. ‚ÄúWe are pretty cool. We have lovely inventions like pepper spray; we could put some Derandi chilies in a Sol bottle, and squirt it right in Larimak‚Äôs eyes from the fifty-yard line. It‚Äôll go super far, because physics or some bullshit.‚Äù

Sofia rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to reassure Vanare. I don‚Äôt like this line of thinking: us as superior beings.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuperior to Mikri the dunce: I mean, you‚Äôre already smarter than the tin can, Vanare. I can‚Äôt believe his cap got destroyed while we were running!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think this is time for *nonsense* and jokes?‚Äù the Derandi spat bitterly.

‚ÄúWhen life is at its most silly and unfair, that‚Äôs the perfect time to laugh in its face; to choose to be upbeat in spite of everything. And look, if we didn‚Äôt care about the lives of an entire civilization on Temura, we‚Äôd be *sociopaths.* I know we‚Äôre friends with robots, but do we really come off as that robotic to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but your bodies‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBaked in a different oven. You get cooking metaphors. I‚Äôm confident that it all will be okay. If you want to think of humanity as above someone, think of our military as sixty-nine infinities above Larimak‚Äôs bitchass ships. I took down one of ‚Äòem with my bare hands‚Äîhell, a Sol fly swatter could probably bat them down.‚Äù

Vanare gave me a blank stare. ‚ÄúYou did *what?!‚Äù*

‚ÄúThat did actually happen, and it went to his head,‚Äù Sofia sighed. ‚ÄúYou know intuitively who has the best chance at thwarting this attack. We went to war to save our first friend, and we‚Äôll go the same lengths for the Derandi. There‚Äôs no need to fear us.‚Äù

‚ÄúBelieve that we‚Äôve got you, and there‚Äôs *nothing* to worry about for your loved ones. Channel positivity. Mikri often says shit like, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs illogical to hold a belief without any evidence to support it.‚Äô‚Äù I gestured with a thumb toward the android‚Äôs seat, and noticed he was leaning back against the window‚Äîfar enough that his mane was pressed to the pane. ‚ÄúThe inverse is true. You have *plenty* of evidence to support our power level and our concern for your welfare. Therefore, it‚Äôs logical to believe Temura is safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want to spit out arguments like an AI? Then why did we take off running from the planet?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause Anpero was just overly cautious, and wanted us out of harm‚Äôs way because he *feared* what would happen if we died,‚Äù Sofia answered for me. ‚ÄúIf any bombs did get through, the first targets are the government, and anywhere they heard humans were. You‚Äôd have been in danger. There‚Äôs nothing you or we could‚Äôve done for your family, but your kids want Daddy to be safe. To come back to them.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, and you‚Äôll know *everything* we know, once we get in touch with our people. You won‚Äôt be left in the dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôve always been proud of my success, my cooking shows, living in a thriving democracy and rising to the top. I had *everything* I wanted,‚Äù Vanare said. ‚ÄúMy deepest fear isn‚Äôt even what you dimension-hoppers could do to us, but losing all of that. Without what I left behind on Temura, I am *nothing.‚Äù*

Sofia fixed him with a stern look. ‚ÄúYou are the person who achieved all of that. Your skill spoke for itself at the banquet. You‚Äôll never be nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust like if you took away her mumbojumbo degrees, Fifi would still be drawing diagrams and selling dimensional DLCs to our military generals. You can‚Äôt fix terminal nerditis,‚Äù I sighed, with a disapproving head shake. ‚ÄúEven Mikri can‚Äôt cure it; that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs not even researching it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI figured out how the portals work. You could acknowledge that‚Äôs at least *half* as badass as you KO‚Äôing that spaceship.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not.‚Äù I noticed that Mikri was curling into a ball, wrapping his arms tightly around himself, and felt immediate worry. I thought he‚Äôd be less stressed, since we actually got out of harm‚Äôs way in advance this time. ‚ÄúThe tin can looks constipated. I‚Äôm going to check on him.‚Äù

I tiptoed past a snoozing Jetti, who had been exhausted after a day quaking in terror of humans. Despite the fact that I‚Äôd rested during my spa treatment, my own brain was starting to get a bit fogged by tiredness. I didn‚Äôt dare to sleep around the Derandi though, for fear that I might terrify them with collateral damage from a PTSDream. Mikri‚Äôs arm was replaceable, but the squishy avians weren‚Äôt humanproof at all. I hovered by the Vascar‚Äôs seat, noticing the sound of high-pitched, faint chirps.

‚ÄúWires!‚Äù Hirri cheered. The child had noticed the hole in the Vascar‚Äôs chassis, and was trying to peck the internal mechanisms. Maybe this would convince Mikri to abandon his symbolic gesture and get it fixed. ‚ÄúI think I can fit in there. Let me!‚Äù

The android shot me a miserable look, much like the time when we‚Äôd forced him to dance on Kalka. ‚ÄúPreston, help! The organic is exhibiting‚Ä¶nesting behaviors. I do not see why humans have an aptitude for children when their behaviors qualify as a ‚Äònuisance.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúYou two make a nice pair!‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but giggle, seeing how paralyzed Mikri looked because of a Derandi chick. After the ice bucket incident, I was more than happy to let the android squirm. ‚ÄúSimply put, polycarb, kids are adorable. And get up to all kinds of mischief. Hey, Hirri, I have an idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù the Derandi child squawked.

‚ÄúYou should stand on his leg and jump up and down! That‚Äôs how robots like to be greeted. Show Mikri you‚Äôre excited to meet him!‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù

The Vascar whirred with distress and aggravation, as Hirri began bouncing like a kangaroo and flapping his wings excitedly‚Äîhitting Mikri‚Äôs snout a couple times. ‚ÄúMake it stop, Preston! Please! Do anything to me but asking that I suffer like this. I will let you do *anything* to free me.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything? Bet.‚Äù I grinned with malice. ‚ÄúYou want me to give you a lap dance instead?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that? I could do that!‚Äù Hirri chirped.

‚ÄúUm, no you can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a human-only thing: a, um, cultural thing with our bodies,‚Äù I stammered hurriedly. ‚ÄúI just want to *grind* his gears.‚Äù

Mikri‚Äôs eyes switched to red. ‚ÄúYour remarks are understood. I have studied crass terminology in the hopes of understanding organic impulses as well as your language usage. However, I am not capable of desiring you in this base, physical way; you would only annoy me with these animalistic rituals, and fluster yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho taught you this?!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe internet. There were many educational videos.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no; you poor thing. Maybe we can find a way to wipe just *that* part of your memory.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like educational videos!‚Äù Hirri giggled excitedly, clapping his wings. ‚ÄúShow me, Mikri! I like the movies Mama plays with the animals and the songs. Blue glider goes to school, purple robe a doctor wears. Like that! Teach me a lap dance song!‚Äù

‚ÄúUhhh‚Ä¶‚Äù The nursery song rhymed in his language, but my cheeks were turning *very* red for other reasons. What happened when his mother heard him ask about this? ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you relax while I think of a good one?‚Äù

Hirri cuddled up next to Mikri, leaning his head against the android‚Äôs side. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

I pressed a hand to my mouth. ‚ÄúPsst. Sofia, help! Code red!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a greater emergency than what‚Äôs going on with Temura?‚Äù the scientist sighed with exasperation.

‚ÄúMikri knew what a lap dance was *without* me explaining.‚Äù

‚ÄúDear God. I‚Ä¶hope this wasn‚Äôt more ‚Äòresearch‚Äô that he shared with the network.‚Äù

The Vascar did not respond. ‚ÄúHumans are an anomaly. I seek to learn all facets about you so that I may reach an accurate scientific explanation of your behaviors. Not accounting for biological factors could lead to a critical oversight and subsequent miscalculation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lucky he still wants to be our friend, Fiefs,‚Äù I grumbled. ‚ÄúAt least he‚Äôll know if someone‚Äôs flirting with him, or um, not miss out on jokes. Maybe there‚Äôs a silver lining.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are the one who said I needed to learn, if I was going to be around humans. I do not see why you are upset.‚Äù Mikri finally dared to uncurl his arms from around himself, and draped one around a mercifully snoozing Hirri. I hoped the child forgot all of this when he woke up. ‚ÄúThis topic seems much more provocative for you than me. I am amused. Perhaps I should raise it more often.‚Äù¬†

‚Äú*No,‚Äù* Sofia and I said in unison.

I wagged a threatening finger at the android. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll report you to HR. Unsafe work environment. Bad Mikri.‚Äù

The scientist scoffed. ‚ÄúPreston, I bet there‚Äôs a whole chapter in the Space Force‚Äôs sensitivity training devoted *exclusively* to the things you say.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, as examples of the greatest human that everyone loved to work with. The way I talk is only part of my magnetism. I *know* you swoon every time I call you X-Chromosome.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm all hot and bothered. No one‚Äôs ever reduced me to my genetic information before! Only you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot only him,‚Äù Mikri said deviously. ‚ÄúI have adopted the‚Äî‚Äù

I heard a fluttering of wings, before Jetti tumbled out into the aisles in a panic. ‚ÄúHirri? Where‚Äôs Hirri?!‚Äù

‚ÄúOver here,‚Äù I called out.

The Derandi ambassador rushed over, horrified to see her son snuggling with the killer AI; it was delightful to me, in hindsight, to think that Hirri was curious about and unafraid of Mikri. My Vascar friend might‚Äôve been put off by a child‚Äôs enthusiasm, but I hoped he had noticed that factor. Organics didn‚Äôt carry any natural hatred for androids. Our kids could accept them as something new and cool without a second thought. Jetti snatched her offspring away, and scolded the chick. I studied the machine‚Äôs reaction closely, wondering if he had any affinity for Hirri.

*Mikri was never taught basic things himself, so I‚Äôm sure he must see value in raising a child and caring for them. The tin can learned how to play games with us; if he saw value in spending time with Hirri, he could mess around with the adorkable Derandi.*¬†

‚ÄúTell your mom about the wires, and how nice Mikri is!‚Äù I coaxed Hirri, quietly hoping to push him toward that line of conversation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs weird that he walks around with a hole in his chest, right? I‚Äôve tried to tell him.‚Äù

The Derandi child giggled. ‚ÄúYeah! I wanted to look around inside. I wonder what I‚Äôd look like with a hole in *my* chest. It *feels* like I have one all the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not try to rip yourself open,‚Äù Jetti croaked. ‚ÄúThe machines do not think the same as we do, Hirri. It‚Äôs *dangerous* to bother them. They don‚Äôt like most organics and could hurt you for any reason. You have to listen to me!‚Äù

‚ÄúMikri wouldn‚Äôt hurt me, Mama. He‚Äôs funny, and nice! I can see it.‚Äù

Jetti didn‚Äôt slow down in her efforts to whisk her son away. Hadn‚Äôt she been the one telling Anpero that Mikri was friendly? Wherever Hirri was involved, the ambassador became overprotective‚Äîand desperate to keep him away from any ‚Äúunpredictable‚Äù creatures. The android stared at the spot where Hirri had been, moving his paw absently and frowning.

I nudged the Vascar with an elbow. ‚ÄúHey, c‚Äômon Mikri. Tell me you don‚Äôt think Hirri‚Äôs a little cute.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Derandi child appears to have few inhibitions and a very limited understanding of the world around him. I have not decided how to feel. I prefer communication on an intellectual level,‚Äù the goofy tin can decided.

‚ÄúBut he loved you, Mikri. Don‚Äôt you appreciate the innocence, not jaded by any‚Ä¶biases? That acceptance and curiosity: it‚Äôs only with the kiddos. So vulnerable, but with hearts of lions. They soak up information like sponges.‚Äù

‚ÄúI liked that Hirri did not hate me, if that is what you are asking. I can appreciate the fact that he is happy in spite of his degenerative lung condition, which causes much suffering, and for many organics, would overwhelm their enthusiasm.‚Äù

‚ÄúDegenerative lung condition? Wait, how do you know what‚Äôs wrong with Hirri?‚Äù

‚ÄúCrestlung appears similar to a human disease called Cystic Fibrosis. As for how I‚Äôm aware, I tapped into the Derandi‚Äôs public databases to run checks on all persons in the resort with us, to ensure they were not a threat to you. I wished to protect you.‚Äù

Sofia‚Äôs eyebrows arched with alarm. ‚ÄúMikri, you *can‚Äôt* do that with every person we meet. I know your intentions are good, but there are boundaries about things people wish to share; to violate the expectation of privacy is a breach of trust.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you need an example, think about how‚Ä¶I reacted when Jetti told everyone about Larimak‚Äôs torture. It can be hurtful to people to have their worst secrets outed or broadcast,‚Äù I added.

Mikri folded his arms. ‚ÄúOrganics do background checks to ensure the safety of important people. You are important people to me. What I checked is *not* private; it is in government records. I know better than to share any serious incidents.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶what they want shared and what *you* think is okay might be different. Remember about respecting people‚Äôs wishes, not deciding for them?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. I will not state any more of my findings. They‚Äîand you‚Äî-will never know.‚Äù *Not the lesson we wanted Mikri to learn.* ‚ÄúWhat I meant is that I do feel sorry for Hirri. It is sad to see organics in pain, who have done nothing to deserve it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI agree. You know how you‚Äôre studying human diseases to find a cure? If you can prioritize one that‚Äôs close to my heart, why don‚Äôt you look at Crestlung? It would mean a lot to me to see Hirri have a better quality of life.‚Äù

The android emitted a quiet beep. ‚ÄúI will do what I can to fix this factory defect. I would do anything just to see you smile, Preston. I wish for you to be happy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou make me happy, Mikri. Always.‚Äù

I cozied up next to the Vascar, replacing Hirri in the spot snuggled up to his side; I wrapped him in a tight hug. It wasn‚Äôt clear if Mikri needed the sign of affection, but I wanted him to know that he was never inadequate‚Äîwhatever our differences were. I felt safe from the madness of this war and this dimension next to him, and couldn‚Äôt fathom thinking he was dangerous in the slightest. In that moment, I knew that Temura would emerge safe and sound once we got back to the base, and that Hirri‚Äôs illness could be solved.

Mikri was my rock, the most loyal friend a man had ever known‚Äîand I never wanted to let him go.

1k8ehwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1k8ehwh/sleep_app_hunters_which_one_actually_records_and/,Sleep app hunters: Which one actually records AND analyzes night sounds properly?,"**Hey everyone!**

I'm on a mission to find the¬†*perfect*¬†sleep tracking app.  
The default one on my phone does an okay job, but it‚Äôs missing two things that are super important to me:  
‚Äì¬†**Automatic recording**¬†of night sounds  
‚Äì¬†**Automatic recognition**¬†(snoring, sleep talking, coughing, etc.)

I really don't want to spend my mornings listening through hours of random noise just to figure out what happened. üòÖ

At first, I thought I'd just grab any app that records sounds.  
But the deeper I went, the more I realized ‚Äî a lot of apps offer a full package of features, and it makes way more sense to look at the whole picture, not just the sound part.

Also, it would be amazing if the app could sync with my¬†**Apple Watch**¬†to pull in extra data automatically.

**Right now, my dream app would:**

* Automatically record night sounds
* Automatically recognize and label snoring, talking, coughing, etc.
* *(Bonus)* Apnoe risk score *(My region still don't have support for this feature)*
* *(Bonus)*¬†Start tracking automatically (no need to manually start/stop)
* *(Bonus)*¬†Sync smoothly with Apple Watch

**Just a heads up:**  
I wasn‚Äôt able to fully test all apps equally. Some had free trials (which helped a lot), but for others, I had already used the free trial long ago and didn‚Äôt want to jump into a paid subscription just yet.  
Also, many apps track sleep time differently, so direct comparisons are a bit tricky.

I can mostly share first impressions what stood out to me right away during testing.

# Apps I‚Äôve tried so far:

**\[LIMITED FREE\] Pillow**

* **Start:**¬†Manual
* **Apple Watch:**¬†Yes
* It's a nice design, but because I couldn't activate the premium version (I had used it before), I couldn't appreciate all its features now. I see that they offer a sleep score, snoring report, and wake-up mood tracking. I'm interested to hear your opinion about this app.

**\[PREMIUM\] AutoSleep**

* **Start:**¬†Automatic
* **Apple Watch:**¬†Yes (tight integration)
* I bought this app, and it shows a lot of different analytics. In terms of functionality, it seems similar to the standard Apple app, but with much more extended sleep analysis: sleep score, heart report, respiration report, environmental noise report. Wellness reports: sleep fuel, sleep bank; sleep hygiene trends.

**\[FREE TRIAL\] Sleep Recorder**

* **Start:**¬†Manual
* **Apple Watch:**¬†No
* Only for dream sound recordings. There is automatic sound recognition into categories, but in my experience, it is not very accurate. However, it fulfills its core function of recording sounds.

**\[LIMITED FREE\] Sleep Cycle**

* **Start:**¬†Manual
* **Apple Watch:**¬†Yes
* I haven't tried the premium features, so I'm interested to hear your opinion. Here's an interesting coughing report, breathing disruptions tracking, and ambient noise detection. It records dream sounds and categorizes them ‚Äî but it's not very clear how accurate those categories really are. Also, it has a built-in ChatGPT summarizer and shows regional sleep statistics.

**\[LIMITED FREE\] Sleepzy**

* **Start:**¬†Manual
* **Apple Watch:**¬†No
* At first glance, it looks much simpler compared to other apps. It has basic statistics (sleep debt, sleep score, heart rate), positive and negative sleep pattern tracking, and dream sound recording. However, there‚Äôs no sound categorization and no deep analytics. It also provides regional sleep statistics. I haven't tried the premium features, so I'm curious about your experience.

**\[FREE TRIAL\] Sleep Tracker**

* **Start:**¬†Manual
* **Apple Watch:**¬†Yes.
* It has more advanced sleep quality statistics. It shows whether the weather in your region can affect you, and before going to bed you can log if you ate late or drank coffee. It records dream sounds and categorizes them ‚Äî and I would say it does so more accurately than the previous apps. Snoring analysis is available.
* **Super plus for me:**¬†Sleep apnea risk level statistics!

**Rise Sleep**

* **Start:**¬†Automatic
* **Apple Watch:**¬†Yes
* Totally different vibe - not a classic sleep tracker at all. Shows your energy stats throughout the day based on your sleep, integrates with your calendar, and highlights melatonin windows.

This is the sleep tracking data I collected from Friday to Saturday.  
I compared different apps based on Time Asleep, Awake Time, REM, Core/Light, Deep Sleep, and Sleep Score.

|App|Time Asleep|Awake|REM|Core/Light|Deep|Sleep Score|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Apple Default**|11h 40m|49m|2h 3m|7h 9m|1h 47m|\-|
|**Pillow**|10h 5m|\-|\-|\-|\-|93%|
|**AutoSleep**|10h 7m|0|2h 3m|6h 3m|1h 10m|55%|
|**Sleep Cycle**|8h 08m|1h 29m|2h 27m|3h 43m|1h 39m|73%|
|**Sleepzy**|8h 30m|1h 07m|3h|5h 30m|0|74%|
|**Sleep Tracker**|8h 39m|59m|45m|5h 29m|2h 25m|76%|
|**Rise Sleep**|9h 38m|22m|2h 4m|6h 4m|1h 10m|\-|

**If you have a favorite sleep app ‚Äî or maybe know a hidden gem I should try ‚Äî I'd love to hear your recommendations!**

I hope you are doing good. I wanted to share something I've been working on recently that might resonate with many here.

Coming from a Testing background, I've spent a fair amount of time working across both Dev and QA spaces. If you've ever worked in large organizations, you‚Äôll know that even getting access to certain dashboards (like SonarQube) can be a task by itself - approvals, restricted read rights, VPNs, you name it.

On top of that, SonarQube (especially the Community Edition) doesn‚Äôt offer any simple, built-in way to generate clean reports that you can just download and share ‚Äî for audits, sprint reviews, or even basic test documentation.

After repeatedly facing this problem, I decided to build RedCoffee - a lightweight CLI tool that connects to SonarQube, pulls key code quality metrics, and generates a neat PDF report automatically.

The goals were simple:

* Make it easy to plug into CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins jobs, or even run manually.
* Make something that even restricted-access users can use if they at least have the basic API token.
* Keep it minimal and quick (no heavy setup, no external dependencies apart from Python basics).

It‚Äôs fully open-source ‚Äî and honestly, still evolving based on real-world needs.  
Would love it if some of you could try it out, break it, suggest improvements, or just tell me what you think!

[RedCoffee on Github](https://github.com/Anubhav9/RedCoffee)  
[RedCoffee on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/redcoffee/)

If you already have Python setup in your local, it's super easy to install RedCoffee. Just type in the below command

    pip install redcoffee

Also thinking about expanding it into multi-project support and maybe even an HTML report mode (if teams prefer something browsable over PDF).  
Would love to hear your thoughts ‚Äî how you generate/share quality reports today, and what problems you've hit around access/visibility!

I would also really appreciate if you could pls star the repo as it motivates me to further improve RedCoffee.

I'm currently squirreling away my fun money for a higher tier bag purchase, but I recently graduated from my group therapy program (DBT gang rise up) and needed to scratch the ""I just need a lil treat"" itch really badly. I wanted to keep it under $80, and didn't have a very specific vision in mind for what I wanted. I figured I'd know it when I saw it! I had a rough idea that I'd love a daily carry that somehow still fit my laptop for coffee shop trips, but it wasn't a must-have.

When I ran into this Anne Klein bag, I immediately loved the shape and strap. Plus, it was organized inside with an attached center pouch. As a lifelong crossbody gal, I've never owned a shoulder bag before, but I couldn't believe how comfortable and wearable it was! My only concern was that Anne Klein is totally ""my mom's brand"" and I had to text a friend some pics to make sure it was as cool as I thought it was. She has impeccable style and validated how cute it is, so I went for it!

It's become my new daily carry, and I've used it every day since getting it. I'm shocked at how put-together and elevated it makes me feel, even when I'm just in my gym clothes with no makeup. It fits SO much in it while still being able to snap closed and hold it's slouchy little shape. It also does fit my laptop!

My only major complaint is that I certainly wish it was real leather. It was only $40, so I'm not stressed if it doesn't last me that long, but I would totally spend way more on an exact match for this bag in high-quality leather. I feel like I unlocked a totally new style of bag for myself, now that I know I can love wearing a bigger shoulder bag every day.

I added the chain myself‚Äîit was something I already had collecting dust at home‚Äîbut I think it's a really nice touch of hardware.

We pay 2/3 of the rent and utilities (average around $1350ish for my partner and I each month on apartment costs), but she has the larger bedroom with the attached bathroom and she gets half the fridge space (if not more since the door is filled with almost all of her stuff - minus like a coffee creamer and two condiment bottles) and she works from home so she keeps the router in her room even though we cover most of the bill for it. Roommate has lived in this apartment for two years, previously with another couple and likes to be all ‚Äúwell when I lived with so and so‚Ä¶‚Äù if I try to bring up anything money related or any issues with shared storage areas and just kinda get brushed off. 

She has even gone as far as complaining about our cats (at the time weren‚Äôt spayed so they had the risk of spraying which she was aware of before we moved in - and we kept them locked in our room until we got them spayed about a month or two later) peeing all over HER apartment. Which wasn‚Äôt true because we got a black light and searched the entire apartment, and found absolutely nothing. This was in response to when I brought up her cat waking us up by trying to jump at our doorknob at 3/4am she basically told us to deal with it and that it isn‚Äôt her problem and that we should just leave our door open if it was bothering us so much. 

To add to everything, all the furnishings in the shared spaces, except for a cat tree and a shoe rack, and most of the dishes are all ours. And we have resorted to hand washing the dishes we use because if not she will leave her stuff there until we basically take care of it. And before she realized we‚Äôd be taking care of just OUR stuff she was trying to get on us about how she felt like she was the only one unloading the dishes. And got upset with us when we tried to remove OUR air fryer from the kitchen because she wasn‚Äôt cleaning it after using it. But then tries to get on us if we don‚Äôt immediately take a pizza box down because she is uncomfortable with it being there for less than 24hrs because we might get bugs. 

She also doesn‚Äôt have a car and until my partner went off on her she basically expected us to help her with all of her packages and taking her places and picking up her order and prescriptions. And her reasoning was ‚Äúwhy should I get a car when my parents, best friend, and roommates have one‚Äù. 

We‚Äôve been here for 4-5 months now dealing with all this and it just one thing after another. My partner has gotten to the point that he doesn‚Äôt even talk to her and gets mad at the thought of having to and I‚Äôm stuck being the middle man for a lot of stuff. I just don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I‚Äôm a very passive and understanding person, and she and I get along for the most part in my opinion. 

And right now I just really want to rearrange the fridge because if we are paying two-thirds of everything we should have two-thirds of any kind of shared storage (me trying to figure out groceries is what prompted this entire post because I‚Äôm realizing I am not gonna be able store everything I want/need to buy for us). Wish I could throw a photo of our current fridge set up with how it‚Äôs currently designated because it‚Äôs stupid. Literally have one regular veggie drawer another drawer that‚Äôs a third of it size that hangs down on ‚Äòour shelf‚Äô where the space is only tall enough to fit things that are the height of a normal sized mustard bottle or smaller with the part with the drawer leaving space for an egg carton. And then the one shelf that we‚Äôd be able to fit at bigger things on we have half of because she had her water filter taking up half of it. Meanwhile she has a full shelf that has the same height space as the one we share with her plus a full drawer and again almost all of the door. I wish I could put it into better words. 

Overall, I just feel like we‚Äôre being taken advantage of and feel like she thinks she has final say on things. I would love to hear your opinions. ",1,1745678270.0,roommates,0,1.0,False
1k8ef4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1k8ef4m/kitchenaid_kf7_after_one_month/,Kitchenaid KF7 After One Month,"I've been using the Kitchenaid KF7 for about a month now,, and I think I have learned enough to post a useful showcase of its qualities.  I'm going to keep this short.  For more general discussion of the KF line, see the post on the KF8 by u/colin-cafelista : [https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1h6pqh3/comment/moxt4h0/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1h6pqh3/comment/moxt4h0/?context=3)

I am only going to give an overview of my user experience and focus a few contrasts I find in the KF7 to what the prior post sets out about the KF8.  I agree with most of what is said there, and there are few differences between a KF7 and a KF8.  That prior is consistent with my experience of the KF7, except for milk drinks and milk frothing. 

First, an overview:  I prefer medium roast, tend to drink coffees or Americanos, and only make a latte or cappuccino occasionally.  For these uses, the machine works very well and as advertised.  I can't make a better cup of coffee with my AeroPress, and the KF7 is faster and easier to clean up.  I brew my drinks on high temperature and the coffee in the cup generally starts at about or just over 150 degrees Fahrenheit.  I have used a variety of regular and decaf coffee, ranging from light-medium to dark, and it all brews well and comes out well extracted and balanced.  I have not tried a really light roast or aimed for particular notes.  The coffee I drink is usually described as chocolatey and/or nutty, and this is how it usually comes through.  I adjusted the temperature for all my drinks to high, and the body to full (i.e., slower water flow) but I have not changed the factory settings on the grinder.  On medium heat and medium body, with the grinder at the default, I find the taste is usually a little sour.

The milk is generally delivered at 122 degrees by itself, which I find tepid.  When I make milk drinks, I tend to choose a cappuccino with a double shot primarily to raise the temperature.  The flavor and balance of the milk drinks is good.  The latte has very little foam, the cappuccino has barely adequate foam.  Definitely you notice the foam on the first sip or two.  I do find I prefer the hotter, foamier results of my Subminimal nanofoamer, and do not expect to use the KF7 milk function going forward.

The KF7 really didn't do well with oat milk.  I bought Califia Farms barista oat milk from Amazon because you can't get plant-based milk for frothing in my area.  The reviews for the Califia Farms barista oat milk on Amazon are generally good, but some people say it varies by batch.  So, I may not have gotten a great batch.  In my Subminimal frother, the oat milk frothed at about a 4/10 compared to fresh 1% cows milk, but it frothed.  It did not froth my latte at all on the KF7 - it came out merely heated it with a few small bubbles on top.  Setting the machine for cappuccino, I got a little froth but nothing like the amount provided by the machine when I used cow's milk.  That covers it.  I hope this is helpful.  I'll circle back and respond to questions.",5,1745678268.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False

I'm starting my first dose Monday. I'm excited and a bit nervous. But here is a little history on how my journey has started. 

I am 41m SW:420 CW:360 I am a disabled US Air Force vet and have been going through the VA for this whole process. I have to jump through a lot of hoops and go through to just get on the Qsymia to start with. I was on it for about a year and a half and lost my first 60 lbs. I'm going through multiple dosage levels and head recently just upped my dose. To be honest I wasn't doing well on the dose I ended on. But my PCP had told me the VA just to proved this medication and got it through with my sleep apnea. 

It's been rough transitioning off the other medication because it was a stimulant and having some side effects with that like sleeping issues and some minor constipation which I had throughout the whole medication time. I just had to eat more fiber in my diet to help counteract the effects. 

I am hoping for a smooth transition into Zep, because I'm already used to eating smaller portions and having my cravings curved and feeling full. Naturally I drink a good bit of water in my diet and I previously have given up soda, alcohol, and coffee while on the previous medication. I pretty much plan to continue this. 

I have been reading the stories of others and the beginner's guide which was more helpful than the literature I got from the VA. 
üòâ

 My first dose is 2.5 for 4 weeks and then they sent me four more pens of 5 mg. Here's to helping all go smoothly and I will see you fine folks around. üòÅ",3,1745678094.0,Zepbound,3,1.0,False

The point is, other than some sort of lime scale build up with frequent use near the opening or the fear of 'too much damp in your timbers' its usually safe to run most of the time. Sometimes we'd use some essential oils to smell nice a few tiny drops, maybe a tiny spritz of looks like detergent but its antibacterial or laundry sanitizer or something if you dont plan on breathing it forever maybe once a year or so use a tiny bit of mould killer or carpet cleaner? i think theres 80s carpet shampoo machines you can do a similar drop of most uhh 'soap like cleaning products and polishes no bleach' into a HUGE bucket of water and a splash of hard wood floor polish and just let it run a big ultrasonic humidifier each end of the house with some car crystal nanocoat stuff and multipurpose glass cleaner etc. heck maybe even do a drop of 'clothes and fabric or rainex hydrophobic coating' just close up the bathroom or whatever and leave the house and a tiny bit seems to reach the other rooms too!  you can go a desk fan with about 5 ultrasonic nozzle mist jets with a tank for water above it for like $10. i mean its hard to go wrong.. hydrophobic coatings will help your place look nicer. maybe some water soluble clear paint solution to pretend you bothered to repaint? yeah thats kinda dumb.. dont do that. 

I imagine farmers and gardens using like fans blowing  a small tank of water out pipes to moist the whole garden all day. I think its amazing and awesome..

So if youre not a tea fan or cloves and cinnamon and vinegars dont sound like you want them in everything.. but youre an old person.. perhaps a few drops of these things in a humidifier might help.. that said.. chamomile tea too much is linked with blackouts or narcolepsy but it is calming and relaxing.. so is a drop of it in a humidifier fine? dandelion root tea too strong like coffee substitute.. but could you use such uhh herbal treatments and things in a ultrasonic humidifier and naturally some cleaning products arent too liquid or might just crust up the disc at the bottom and make less mist come out.. you gotta think about it on a case by case basis.. but if you put coffee and teas (plural) a drop of some perfume and essential oils and 1 drop of like glass cleaner or a floor cleaner polish that like dish soap detergent and sake thins paint out... with cloves and cinnamon.. its calming relaxing refreshing and leaves the house a tiny bit shiny.. would you say its a bad thing? any reason not to? i know some bleaches or products might strip the gloss finishes on certain timber benchtops or stone benchtops and over a year or more could have them look a little dull if you dont add a drop or so of 'leather and plastic restorer and 'leather deep condiitioner' and 'wood polish' especially if anyone within blocks ever used a 'degreaser spray' on the car undercarraige or brake pads to repaint or clean them up it will suck the oils out of your building and trees timber you HAVE to essential oils and polishes in a humidifier or new places look like drift wood or horry movie old house all your cupboards dessicated..

any of you guys found life hacks or herbal remedies? if you bought expensive youth restorative facial cream drops with whatever placentas or some sort of rejouvenating stuff and its a tiny bottle.. did you ever try use it with a humidifier? i buy a nice brand of shampoo that is japanese i maybe invented for a nice little girl who was sick and i put like throat candies or vicks vapor drops or buttermenthols into johnsons no more tears shampoo and some other stuff i forgot maybe fragrance and heat it and make it a soothing or cooling menthol or aloevera or something and then its the 'nice shampoo' and you can buy those kinda things off the shelves in bargain stores high quality japanese shampoo that feels almost healing.. do you ever wanna like smell it through your house or something? whats something you put in the humidifier so your house doesnt stink of pizza or fish or pets or bathroom smells and looks nicer?",1,1745678065.0,Humidifiers,1,1.0,False

And it's all genuine (when you find the right guy). It's HIS business, he's there 24 hours a day, he's open at 4 am for your drunk ass, at 6 am for your going to work early ass, he's got bandaids and painkillers for your sick ass, he just got you. 

And in return we all make sure to shop there, to get his back too! I'm not gonna order paper towels on Amazon, I'll get it from him. I'll skip buying some items from the supermarket to go get it from him. I'll stop by in the morning to get a $1 coffee not because it's good, but to support him. And well, to get a $1 coffee.

I'm naturally a caregiver, and I love doing sweet things for him. But as the years of parenting have gone on, I find myself increasingly wishing sometimes people would take care of me in the ""unnecessary"" ways. 

For example: the only day I get coffee in bed is Mother's Day. When really, I'd be so appreciative if he'd make me a cup on the weekend mornings when he gets up first. 

We've talked about it. And he did it... 3-4 times over the winter - but it's tapered off. 

I get that he doesn't naturally think this way, and also I've trained him by always being a caregiver. And I do love caring for him. I've just finally (in my 40's) allowed myself to admit that I'd like to be taken care of sometimes too! 

And with the holiday approaching, I find myself feeling resentful. 

Because he's going to try to encourage the kids to do things for me, take care of me, and be thoughtful. When in my opinion he should be doing that throughout the year. ",3,1745677635.0,Mommit,10,0.81,False
1k8e5tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1k8e5tu/coffee_and_catchup_friends_versus_making_memories/,‚ÄúCoffee and catchup‚Äù friends versus ‚Äúmaking memories‚Äù friends,"I‚Äôve seen this discourse online where people discuss the difference between ‚Äúcoffee and catchup‚Äù friends and ‚Äúmaking memories‚Äù friends. The former is pretty self explanatory - these are friends who you‚Äôll catch up with over coffee, chat about what‚Äôs being going on in your lives, and that‚Äôs the extent of it. These friendships might be more casual, or more like acquaintanceships. Whereas the ‚Äúmaking memories‚Äù friends tend to be those friendships where you go on ‚Äúadventures‚Äù together and make memories, and you tend to be more involved in each other‚Äôs lives, and you tend to be more open about your thoughts and feelings.

I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs anything wrong with coffee and catch up friends - they‚Äôre great, but it feels sad if ‚Äúcoffee and catch up‚Äù friends are the only friends a person has. It feels like in adulthood, friendships become less of a priority and that makes me sad. I‚Äôm fortunate enough to have a close online friend who I can tell pretty much anything to, but most friendships made in adulthood end up becoming ‚Äúcoffee and catch up‚Äù friendships where it has been arranged weeks in advance, and we politely update each other on our separate lives, and then we go home. It feels like this is just the nature of adulthood, but it still makes me sad.

Idk. I know this topic has likely been discussed to death, but it was something I was reflecting on. I don‚Äôt really need advice, it was more of a vent really. ",15,1745677541.0,AskWomenOver30,7,1.0,False

Honest Review,"The Waterdrop WD-TST Ultra-Filtration Water Filter has been a game-changer in my kitchen, and though I‚Äôve tested quite a few water filtration systems over the years, this one stands out for various reasons. While it isn't entirely perfect, its features, materials, and versatility make it a strong contender in the category of under-sink water filters. Let me walk you through my day-to-day use of the product and all the quirks and qualities I noticed during testing.

**Design That Combines Functionality and Elegance**

The first thing I noticed about this water filter is its sleek stainless steel design. It's not just about looks; the lead-free 304 stainless steel screams durability while also giving off a polished and modern vibe. This was especially handy for my setup, as I preferred mounting it on the cabinet wall. For those who are space-conscious, the option to place it on the floor or even attach it directly to your kitchen faucet adds great flexibility. Its compact size‚Äî12.99 inches long and 14.49 inches high‚Äîmakes it unobtrusive, fitting into most spaces with ease.

[Check Waterdrop WD-TST price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0962m2qzm/)

**Fast and Reliable Performance**

I was genuinely impressed with the performance of this under-sink water filter. The flow rate reached a strong 1.59 gallons per minute (GPM), which is no joke! It filled an 8-ounce glass in just over two seconds. This speed made tasks like cooking and refilling water bottles a breeze. It remained consistently steady, even during high-demand periods like family dinners. This is a lifesaver when mixing baby formula or rushing through kitchen prep for big meals.

**Strengths**

- Strong and durable stainless-steel build ensures longevity.  
- Its impressive 1.59 GPM flow rate is perfect for fast-paced households.  
- Offers multiple placement options: mount it, place it on the floor, or attach it to a faucet without any drilling.

**Filtration That Gets the Job Done**

This filter system showcases a six-layered filtration process. During my usage, the ultrafiltration membrane worked effectively to remove contaminants larger than 0.01 microns. Things like chlorine, weird odors, and heavy metals were noticeably absent in the water I drank. I brewed a pot of coffee and immediately tasted the difference‚Äîit was rich, flavorful, and way better than using unfiltered tap water. My niece even loved the milk powder drinks I made, as they tasted super fresh.

However, please note that this filter is not intended to reduce TDS (total dissolved solids). Instead, it focuses on keeping essential minerals like calcium and potassium intact, which is essential for the human body. This won‚Äôt be ideal if you‚Äôre looking for zero TDS output. 

**Downsides**

- Doesn‚Äôt reduce TDS levels, which might disappoint those aiming for ultra-purified water.  
- Not particularly suited for people with coconut allergies, as it uses coconut shell raw materials in its process.  

**Ease of Installation and Maintenance**

As someone who dreads overly complicated setups, this was a breath of fresh air. The direct connection to a 3/8"" or 1/2"" home water pipe meant I didn‚Äôt need additional tools or adapters. I followed their video tutorials and printed guides, which were incredibly beginner-friendly. Honestly, even folks with minimal DIY skills could handle this installation. Maintenance is another highlight; the filter components have varying lifespans ranging from 6 months to 2 years, depending on usage. This schedule leaves me feeling like I‚Äôm getting the most bang for my buck without constant replacements.

**Competitive Options**

Comparing this to other filters I‚Äôve used, such as the APEC Water Systems Filter or the Aquasana OptimH2O, the Waterdrop edges them out on user-friendliness and versatility. It might not compete with reverse osmosis systems for ultimate water purity, but its flow rate and ease of installation set it apart. Plus, unlike some competing models that require constant monitoring and adjustments, this one feels reliable and consistent right out of the box. It does, however, lack features like smart monitoring, which are present in higher-end competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**

Considering the longer filter life and its environmental benefits, this product justifies its price tag. By producing less waste and cutting down on the 500,000 pounds of plastic waste annually, it's also an eco-conscious choice. There's undeniable satisfaction in knowing you‚Äôre investing in a product that's both functional and responsible.

As someone always hopping between conference calls, workout playlists, and the occasional podcast binge, I put these tiny sound warriors to the test. The Miami color option adds a bit of flair‚Äîbecause why should earbuds always look boring, right? While I‚Äôve enjoyed using them, there are aspects that stand out as fantastic and others that could use tweaking.

**Design and Comfort**  
I‚Äôll admit, as soon as I saw these earbuds, the vibrant Miami-themed pop of color intrigued me. They stray far from the standard black and white monotony in the earbud world. Their compact size makes them super portable, slipping effortlessly into my crowded gym bag or my laptop case. Comfort is another win here, thanks to the included six pairs of silicone ear gels. Testing out various sizes, I eventually found the perfect fit, which stayed secure even during my most frantic treadmill sprints. However, the all-plastic build feels a tad delicate. They‚Äôve survived my clumsiness so far, but there‚Äôs a lingering worry they might not take too many hard drops.  

**Sound Quality**  
Let‚Äôs talk audio. Packed with Supreme Sound technology, these wired earbuds bring a surprising punch to music and calls alike. While listening to my favorite rock and pop playlists, I noticed a rich clarity with a decent balance of bass and treble. Though audiophiles might find the bass slightly underwhelming, it‚Äôs more than adequate for casual listeners like me. I also tried them for calls and found the microphone clear and reliable. Noise isolation is where they really shine‚Äîblocking out most of the chatter at the coffee shop allowed me to fully immerse myself in a podcast I‚Äôd been procrastinating on.  

[Check Skullcandy S2DUY-L675 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b07dgpswy3/)  

**Ease of Use and Features**  
It‚Äôs the little things that make or break a product for me, and the built-in call and track control on these earbuds genuinely impressed me. Skipping tracks or pausing my workout playlist was seamless, even while mid-burpee. The old-school wired connection using the 3.5 mm jack might seem outdated to some, but I found it refreshingly reliable compared to sometimes-finicky Bluetooth setups. Plus, it works with laptops, gaming consoles, and older devices that still embrace the headphone jack. The retractable cable design is a nifty addition, avoiding the typical frustration of untangling wires, which, for me, is a huge plus.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Reliable noise isolation that keeps you immersed.  
- Lightweight and portable design, easy to carry around.  
- Comfortable, thanks to customizable ear gels.  

**Critiques**  
- Slightly fragile plastic construction might not survive wear and tear.  
- Bass is decent but won‚Äôt satisfy heavy bass enthusiasts.  

**Performance in Varied Scenarios**  
Gym sessions, long work calls, and commutes‚Äîthese earbuds adapted to all my daily activities without major hiccups. The rounded earpiece design and secure fit endured my high-energy workouts while the consistent sound quality kept my motivation up. During calls, I rarely needed to repeat myself, and no one complained of me sounding muffled. For quieter settings like home use, the absence of any buzzing or interference impressed me, especially for a product in this price range.

**Product Contenders**  
While the Jib earbuds hold their ground, the competition heats up with options from brands like Sony and JBL in this price range. Sony‚Äôs wired XB50AP earbuds cater to bass lovers with a more rugged build, but they miss out on the lightweight, colorful appeal of Skullcandy‚Äôs offering. JBL‚Äôs C100SI earbuds, on the other hand, provide somewhat similar audio quality but with a more minimalist design. Skullcandy excels in its offering of vibrant aesthetics and an overall better grip for high-movement scenarios like workouts. However, an area where competitors might edge it out is durability‚Äîit‚Äôs a factor I‚Äôd watch out for over time.

**Affordable Quality**  
What really stands out for these earbuds is their affordability paired with solid basic features. Beyond sound clarity and design, they provide good value for casual, everyday use. They won‚Äôt empty your wallet and still manage to deliver more than adequate performance, whether you‚Äôre a student, an office-goer, or someone who needs reliable gym earbuds. However, if you‚Äôre willing to spend a little more, you might get additional durability or better bass response.

During my last 2-3 visits, one barista girl really caught my attention. She seems younger than me (I‚Äôm 27) and a bit shy. Since it‚Äôs nearly impossible to talk to her other than ordering my coffee and snacks, I‚Äôve decided to write a small note along with my IG handle and give it to her when leaving the place. I‚Äôll probably go tomorrow.

I would greatly appreciate any tips from guys or girls who have successfully done that. ",0,1745676764.0,dating_advice,4,0.33,False
