(He isn’t my bf we are just exclusive: Reddit rules and he has not asked me to be his gf) ) Me (24F) and my bf (24M) have been seeing each other for a little over a year now. Before me and him got together there was a period in my life where my headspace was in a horrible place. I had taken off school for the semester and at that same time my parents weren’t happy about it and cut me off financially. I was going through a bad roommate situation at the time to the point it was stressing me out to the point I couldn’t eat. I ended up having an eating disorder and losing a LOT of weight. After that time I was still in a bad place with my family, I’m talking no contact and when there is contact it’s never a peaceful battle. This took a huge toll on my metal health. When I lost weight I also stated to receive a lot of attention from people. This kind of attention made me feel good in the moment. During that time I ended up sleeping with 9 people. (Jan-June) Most of them where one night stands and only two of them I’ve slept with 2 times & 3 times. There was a point during that time where I felt suicidal and contemplated about taking my own life. Towards the very end of may to middle of June that is when I really started to rebuild my relationship with my parents which is also the time I met my bf. At first we were just sleeping together but then we started to conversation make in person and I felt like I started having a good connection with him. At that time as well I registered to the next semester, rebuilt my relationship with my parents, got back on track financially and regained respect and love for myself. I regret that way I handled my emotions in the past and how I coped with them and if God gave me his hand and offered to take me back in time go change something that’s that I would change. I know that Everyman that I have slept with brings my value down as a woman. I would never go back to that kind of lifestyle and I know now better ways to cope. 

Continuing, after my bf and I have seen each other for about 6 months we were talking about something along the lines of body counts and he says “I would never take a girl seriously if she had over ten bodies” “I’d automatically think she’s a slut” “I would never be with a woman like that”  of course at this time I really liked him and truly saw a future and wanted to pursue him. When he said those things I felt so guarded and even more ashamed of my past even after I learned to forgive myself. I was afraid that he was going to see me as the person I was back in the day. I know that I’m a changed person who is high valued and has good morals and values. I didn’t want him to think of me in that way. So I told him I had 5 bodies. I lied to him. I knew it was wrong. I was so scared that he’d look at me a different way. He believed me and things were good. He then noticed someone who he has mutual with like my post on instagram he was one of my bodies. I liked him so much during these time to the point that people from my parent and just people in general who aren’t him is like a blurred name for me. I understand how it looks from his end and how it looked like I still craved the validation and attention. I do not. My main focus is on my bf and I do not care about those men. I know the bottom line is that I should have been more conscious of that and removed them in the first place. Keep in mind that me and my bf are still not actually labeled as bf and gf and that we are just exclusively talking. Time goes on and I have continued to carry the lie that my body count is 5. 

One night he saw on my phone a name of a man who I was friends with in high school years ago. This friend of mine had asked me multiple times to grab lunch of coffee and I have told him that I was seeing someone and it would be disrespectful to meet with another man one of on. I wasn’t interested in seeing him at all. Once my bf saw these that’s when shit hit the fan. 

He started to question my loyalty and started to badger me about my body count. Knowing that I’m still lying I was still scared that he’d think of me a different way and that he wouldn’t accept me for my past. But I should have known that we have been together for this long that he still would have accepted me if I had told him the truth. Anyways, I reassure him about the situation with this friend from highschool and I block him and remove him off everything without any hesitation. Later goes on and he starts to really question if I had been lying about something which he was right about. This is where I had become somebody I thought I’d never become. After days of continuing to lie to him during our arguments about my body count I finally became brave enough to tell him everything. 

I laid everything flat for him and was completely honest and transparent about everything. I told him my true body count which is 12. And since that day forward I have been nothing but honest with him. For the past month we have been really trying to rebuild the trust and fix the relationship. A few weeks ago we had a wine night and I got a little drunk and passed out. He went through my phone and found a list I had made at that point over a year ago of all the people I have slept with and I had rated my experience with them. At that time my view of sex was different. I never had been able to have an orgasm before so I wasn’t sure exactly what good sex meant. I genuinely thought that just because i was wet meant the sex was good. I’ve never had sex like that before and I haven’t had much experience exploring sexually so everything is new to me. I have been over communicating, telling him when I leave my house, who I’m with, sending him pictures of the activities that I do etc  he has my location on both snap and find my. He also has the log ins to my social medias. Recently he has made me text the people I have slept with asking them when the last time we saw each other was. The ones who replied confirmed that they haven’t seen me since before I started sleeping with my bf. 

He had me key word certain words on my laptop to go back into the message history around the time frame me and my bf started talking. At this point of feel like this relationship has become a dead beat. I know that I had lied to him about my body count which created a huge strain on our relationship and I’ve been activity trying to regain that trust and more. He continued to call me a slut and a whore because of my past. I have nothing but faith and loyal to him since we started talking. I haven’t slept with anybody since the day me and him slept together for the first time. Before we started talking exclusively and just seeing each other for sex I liked a story of this guy I used to sleep with. At that time I thought my bf was still talking to other girls and sleeping with other people. Me and this guy never texted or talked and only texted when we wanted to link up. I didn’t have any kind of connection with him nor did I want to pursue anything with this man. 

During some of our arguments he had said some things like “I can make u insecure so quick” “I’ll make a list of my body and maybe you’ll know how it feels” “I should have fucked this girl when she texted me and you were in Thailand” “so many girls wanna fuck me but in here taking to you” anything you can think of along the lines of those he probably has said to me. I know that these things were said in the heat of the moment which is why I’m trying to not take it too much to heart. 

I truly don’t blame him for how he feels and why he doesn’t trust me anymore. I have put myself in his shoes and really analyzed everything. I understand how he feel about everything and I understand the way it made his heart hurt. ",2,1762242841.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1oo1i4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oo1i4s/when_can_i_reach_out_if_he_doesnt_reach_out_first/,When can I reach out if he doesn’t reach out first?,"Now before I get absolutely flamed in the comments-I know I shouldn’t. But. Giving myself a hypothetical “date” or “scenario” of when/how I would reach out if he never reaches out first helps me get through every day of no contact. It’s a mind trick, but I know in the back of my head I shouldn’t anyways, and I still am working on myself, moving on etc as each day passes. 

So I dated a dismissive avoidant for a year and a half, I was his first relationship after his first love 7 year relationship he thought was going to be endgame (she ended it, not him). I thought things with us were perfect, I realize now he had some issues with avoidance throughout the relationship, but none that created any “problems I couldn’t fix” until he dumped me. Randomly came to my house, no conversation before or anything, said he isn’t happy, doesn’t know why, tried but couldn’t love me, doesn’t even know if his job is right for him, etc. Said he showed me “all sides” of him and I know the most about him over anyone else and he cares about me so much and would like to be friends, but at the least “talk about things with a clearer mind in a couple weeks over coffee”. I said I would like to be friends but I can’t be friends if he’s seeing someone else. I don’t have 100% confirmation, but I have a gut instinct (which unfortunately is usually correct) that he is seeing someone, just casually/lusty. So I returned his key 3 days later without texting or seeing him (which was supposed to be our gateway to reconnecting). He did not reach out within those 3 days, and I unadded him on social media. Did not block him anywhere. I recently publicized my Instagram account after about 6 weeks of no contact to signal the door is open for a conversation, but I did not directly follow him back/message him, etc. I know I should be waiting for him to contact me first, but I think this is as open as I can be without doing anything direct. My worry (and I know I know, this is avoidant behavior but still) is that he is too afraid of how much he hurt me to reach out even if he wants to. I don’t want that to be the factor that keeps us from reconnecting. If we don’t reconnect because he truly never wants to, or he reaches out and I’m moved on fully by then, that’s fine with me. But he expressed that worry of not being sure if I’ll want to talk to him again because of how much he knew he was hurting me when in the act of dumping me, and that has stuck in my brain.

So, assuming that’s the case, at what point can I send him a casual message offering gentle communication? I was thinking around Christmas (3.5 months post breakup/no contact) shooting a text saying something along the lines of “hey heard this song I remember you listen to around Christmas, hope the holidays are treating you well”. That hypothetical scenario has kept me strong 7 weeks now, but time is starting to go by and if my mindset is still not over him Christmas may come and I may send it. So, is that acceptable? Is that too early, and should I hold out and make a new hypothetical scenario so I don’t cave then? His birthday is in April, so that’s another option, that would be 6.5 months post breakup/no contact. Some people tell me that’s too long gone by then, but the more I learn about dismissive avoidants, especially those that rebound, the more that doesn’t seem true. Shit, I don’t even know if 6.5 months is too early, I’ve seen posts on here of them reaching out after over a year. Now of course the goal is to have moved on by then, but honestly as of now I would be open to reconciling. Selfishly, I want to catch him before he moves on forever. Except for the avoidant state of his mind, we actually had very compatible futures and relationship dynamics. 

And now for the question I don’t really want an answer to but I should be realistic and ask. Should I really never ever reach out if he doesn’t first? My friends all say the “if he wanted to he would” but again, is that the same mold that fits a dismissive avoidant? My feelings may still change, but him being my first real relationship and first real love, I will probably always care about him and want to make sure he is doing well. So even if I don’t want to reach out to reconcile for a second chance I might still want to reach out because I care…I would still appreciate an answer for my mind trick though about when I *could* reach out even if I *shouldnt* ",2,1762242417.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I love being a lesbain,"Okay, this is one of my first posts on reddit so pardon any mistakes or reddit faux-pas lmao. I(21 NB) have gone on two dates with this person(21 NB) (our third is tomorrow) and I just need to say somewhere that I feel soooooo lesbian about this person. I've known I was queer for about a decade at this point, but didn't start openly identifying as a lesbian until the last couple of years. Even then I've entangled myself in a couple of romantic situations with men under the guise that my sexuality has always felt more fluid than labels are able to represent (it never feels good haha). That being said, the most prominent relationship I've had in my life was very queer in nature. 

Okay okay, back to the point. We went to a teahouse last week, and just a few days ago we went for a gorgeous hike. Tomorrow, we're going to get coffee from a cute little cafe on the big river in my city. I've been dating casually since my last serious relationship ended about a year-and-a-half ago, but I usually overanalyze dating situations and think more logically about why I do/don't want to date someone. With them though, I am having such sapphic urges. I want to make them a handmade gift, write them a long letter, spend cozy quality time together. I try really hard to take things as they come in relationships and not idealize any person before I've gotten to know them as the human they are but, I'm having such a hard time feeling casually about this person. 

I generally question so many things in romantic situations, and while I'm not going to jump into a relationship with this person immediately (especially not before having many conversations) I just wanted to share the joys of feeling sapphicly about someone. It is FREEING to finally find something outside of the social confines I often feel restricted to. I am like, seriously thinking about making them a playlist instead of finishing my homework for my class tomorrow. We haven't done a check-in yet, which I hope to do tomorrow so wish me the best of luck! If anyone has any advice or tips for how it might be fun to express my affection, or stories about their own sapphic joys I'd love for you to share. I am still very much scared, but finally feel like I can trust my body/mind in feeling so wonderfully about sharing time with this person. Yippee!",1,1762242158.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

All the useless context:

I hit the absolute nastiest work session yesterday — cranked out a project and a research paper between 2pm and 12:45am while holding a posture that negates any perceived benefits of sitting on a Herman Miller chair. I bet some of you saw me pacing around like a madman by the vending machines on the first lower level while scarfing down overpriced protein bars and Rice Krispy Treats™️. If you were sitting near me at any point you probably saw me head bobbing to my guilty pleasures playlist as I aggressively typed on my over-spec’d MacBook Pro. Picture included kinda shows where I was sitting.

ANYWAYS… I left Bobst around 12:40am this morning for some shawarma (shoutout to Mamoun’s on MacDougal St.) and sleep, only to realize after showering that I left my charger in the reading room on the 8th floor of the library. It’s a 60w Anker USB-C charger with a white cable.

1oo19dc,https://i.redd.it/iuj0v2kj07zf1.jpeg,Новий спосіб заварювати фанкові анаеробні кави - і чому іноді варто навмисно «втрачати» частину напою,"Коротко

Якщо ваша анаеробна кава смакує солоною, бульйонною чи нагадує оливки, проблема не в зернах і не у вас. За словами кавового експерта The Coffee Chronicler, справа у тому, яку частину напою ви п’єте першою. Під час заварювання саме перші мілілітри містять найбільше сполук, що створюють умамі-смак. Якщо ці кілька грамів просто вилити, кава стане чистішою, фруктовішою та солодшою.

Детальніше

У своєму відео “A Better Way to Brew Funky Naturals” кавовий блогер The Coffee Chronicler (Ассер Крістіансен) пояснює, що під час анаеробної ферментації у зернах накопичується глутамінова кислота — те саме, що робить сушені томати або пармезан насичено умамними. І під час заварювання ці сполуки виходять першими, створюючи відчуття «солоного бульйону» у чашці.

Крістіансен помітив цей ефект на чемпіонаті World Brewers Cup, де колумбійський бариста Карлос Ескобар навмисно зливав перші 10 грамів кави, щоб зменшити різкість і солоність. Пізніше блогер адаптував техніку для AeroPress і показав, що метод можна легко повторити вдома.

⸻

Суть рецепта
	1.	13 г анаеробної кави, помол крупний, вода 90°C
	2.	Залити 50 г води, струсити, відтиснути і перші ~35 г рідини відкласти
	3.	Долити воду до 150 г, почекати 2 хвилини, повільно продавити
	4.	Повернути близько 20 г першої рідини назад у чашку

Результат — більше фруктів, менше умамі, чистіший баланс. Якщо повернути забагато, фанковість повертається.

⸻

Навіщо це працює

Цей метод — селективна екстракція: ми пропускаємо початкову фракцію, де містяться солоні, різкі та умамні речовини, і зосереджуємось на тій частині, де солодкість і кислотність більш виразні. Для митих сортів це може бути зайвим, але для фанкових анаеробних — відкриття.

Not an ad just a very satisfied passerby. Stopped in on a whim and grabbed their iced cup because, well, the cup looked like it belonged on my feed 😭
Taste wise it was smooth, a little creamy, and actually tasted like coffee rather than syrup. The espresso had a pleasant punch up front but the finish stayed velvety, not bitter. Ice melt kept it from getting watered down for a good while so every sip stayed solid 😍

Service was quick and friendly, the vibe is chill, and it felt like a nice little treat for a sunny day.

Recently had our second child who is now 5 weeks and after a very rough month of parental leave my husband is back to work as of yesterday.

Our almost 2.5 year old had a super tough time with a new baby at home. I knew there would be changes but he is over the too clingy with my husband and we’re at our wit’s end with trying to constantly comfort him. My husband can’t make a coffee, pee, or leave the room without our toddler losing his mind and wanting him to constantl hold and pick him up.

We try to each play with him one on one for solo time without baby, but he doesn’t want much to so with me (even prior to baby he was generally like this.) It doesn’t seem to improve any anxiety about daddy. He’s demonstrating a lot of “attention seeking” behaviour like hitting and being super hyper. He generally avoids listening to directions and doesn’t acknowledge me talking to him if it’s a correction.

Now, yesterday was my husband’s first day back at work and my toddler has hand foot and mouth.

We both aren’t sleeping, now I can’t send toddler to his dayhome (he goes 2x weekly) as planned. I’m feeling major baby blues, sleeping 2-5 hours a nigh with my 5 week old.

We have no family support and I don’t know what to do. Is this just how it is with two? I wanted to be better postpartum this time and I’m failing to do anything right with my kids.

1oo16hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Newsletters/comments/1oo16hh/weekly_prediction_challenge_based_on_things/,Weekly Prediction challenge based on things happening in the marketing world,"Last week was Week 1. Here's what happened.

**The Challenge:**

Every Monday, I send subscribers a prediction challenge based on something happening RIGHT NOW in marketing.

Not case studies from 2019. Not ""what worked for a Fortune 500."" But Real brands. Real moves. Real-time.

**Last week's setup:**

* Anthropic opened an AI café in NYC (5,000+ people lined up)
* Perplexity opened Café Curious in Seoul
* Cursor did a pop-up in SF

AI companies were taking brands offline.

**The question:** What happens next week?

A) OpenAI launches ChatGPT coffee truck in London/Tokyo  
B) Google panic-opens Gemini lounges  
C) Non-AI brand hijacks trend (Notion? Figma?)  
D) Trend dies (too expensive to scale)

**The Winner:**

**Preyaansh** replied:

*""Duolingo shows up with an espresso-slinging green owl yelling 'You didn't finish your lesson.'""*

He won **""The 2026 Marketing Playbook That Goes Viral""** — a breakdown of tactics that will help brands stand out in the market.

Do challenges like these make a newsletter more engaging? Something that gives marketers a competitive edge?  
The goal here is to train **pattern recognition** and exercise the right thought processes. You might not predict the market, heck I cannot predict the market. But this exercise does give some creative outputs that people can test. Let me know your thoughts.

""Of course, I thought about it myself,"" my son agreed.

""Oh, look, one cup has the rest of coffee and the other one has sugar. If you remember, Haya, they were full last night,"" Noam noted.  
  
""Yes, that's true, but the question remains ""What kind of unknown and invisible creature was pouring that sugar and coffee on me?"" I thought.  
  
""Obviously, it was some kind of mystical Invisible creature. Let's call it that IB, Haya,"" the son suggested.  
  
""And you know, Noam, if it was possible to assume that the strange events in our previous apartment were caused by a boiler leak or even a spirit, then today's two cases can no longer be interpreted as anything other than unexplained paranormal phenomena happening to us.

1oo13pj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oo13pj,I’d love to ask for your thoughts on something I’ve been making,"I started creating these small “spiritual/kindness” mugs almost by accident. At first I would draw little stick figures on them—simple reminders to be kind, not just to others but mainly to myself, because I used to speak to myself in ways I would never speak to anyone else.

Then I began adding short quotes from ACIM. Having those words in my hands every morning, on my coffee mug, then later on my tea mug, made a bigger difference than I expected. Seeing the same reminders over and over actually helped me stay aligned with the practice.

Over time I refined the design, and I also created a version adapted for differently-abled use: two handles and a spot for a straw. Someone told me her mother with Parkinson’s would love a “real mug” instead of a plastic children’s one, and that really moved me. As someone with chronic disabilities myself, I spent time thinking about what could genuinely uplift someone who is physically limited or nearing the end of their journey—while staying grounded in the nonduality of the Course, but also accessible for people who just need reminders of kindness and love.

I’ve started selling these (for now only within the greater EU), but I’d love to hear your opinion as students of the Course.

Would you prefer explicit ACIM quotes—like from the Workbook—or something more general that you could bring to work without feeling like you’re inviting “those looks,” yet still having a constant nudge to forgive and be kind?",2,1762240807.0,ACIM,0,1.0,False

1oo10qn,https://youtu.be/oEy3LyR1H6w,4 Very Scary TRUE Midnight Lake Fishing Horror Stories,"# ""What Broke Victor"":

I had this spot on Reelfoot Lake that my buddies and I claimed every season. Alex, Ben, and I had been fishing there for years—same wooden shelter on the water’s edge, same rickety benches, same battered cooler that somehow never gave out. It wasn’t much to look at: a low roof to keep the rain off, some hooks on the wall, and a tie-up post for the boat. But it was ours. Every winter we’d haul in catfish big enough to feed a family, swapping stories until dawn and laughing loud enough to scare off anything with ears.

That night in late January, the cold bit deep, the kind of chill that turns breath into fog and water into glass. We loaded the boat just after dark—rods, bait, and a cooler full of beer and sandwiches—and pushed off around ten. Alex steered us out, the small motor humming against the stillness. The lake was black and silent under the moon, broken only by the slap of water against the hull.

“Prime time,” Ben said, threading a hook like it was second nature. “The cats’ll be hungry tonight.”

I grinned, settling on my bench with a thermos of coffee. “Then let’s make it count.”

Our lines hit the water with quiet plunks. For the first couple of hours, everything was easy—steady bites, quiet talk, the comforting rhythm of old friends who knew each other too well to need words. Alex reeled in a small one early on. “Dinner already,” he said, grinning as he held it up.

Ben chuckled. “Put it back. We’re after monsters tonight.”

The air smelled of bait and river mud. I passed around sandwiches from the cooler, and we talked about life—Alex managing the farm, Ben at the outdoor store, me working odd jobs just to get by. The same small talk we always had, but somehow it felt good just being out there again. “Remember that storm last time?” Ben said. “Nearly lost the boat.”

Alex snorted. “Don’t jinx it, man.”

Hours drifted by, and the night grew colder. The wind died completely. That’s when I noticed it—a small light moving across the lake, bobbing like a lantern on the water.

“Someone else out here?” I muttered, squinting.

Ben shaded his eyes. “Probably just passing through.”

But it wasn’t passing. The engine was running low, barely a hum, and the light kept coming closer. Soon we could hear the quiet splash of another boat idling up beside ours. A man stepped out—older, hunched a little, wearing a dark coat that looked soaked through. He carried something long at his side, like a case or a tool.

He tied his boat next to ours and stood in the doorway of the shelter, silent.

“Hey,” Ben called, friendly but cautious. “You need something? You looking to fish?”

The man didn’t answer. He just watched us.

Alex leaned toward me, whispering, “What’s he doing?”

The stranger finally stepped under the roof. He was tall, gaunt-faced, eyes hollow and unreadable in the lantern light. He held his case tight against his leg. Something about the way he gripped it—like it wasn’t just a fishing pole—set my nerves on edge.

“Evenin’,” I said, trying to ease the tension. “Cold night to be out.”

He looked at me briefly, then turned toward the door again, mumbling something I couldn’t make out. Ben followed him out, still talking. “You got a line? We got room if you’re—”

The sound shattered the night.  
**Boom.**

Ben’s voice cut off mid-word, followed by a splash.

I froze. Alex shot to his feet. “What the hell was that?”

We rushed to the door, and I saw Ben floating face down between the boats, the water around him blooming red. My mind couldn’t catch up—couldn’t make sense of it. The man stood on the deck, the “case” now unmistakably a shotgun, smoke curling from the barrel.

“You shot him!” I yelled, my voice breaking.

Alex lunged at him. “Why? Why’d you—”

**Boom.**

The blast hit Alex square in the side. He stumbled back, clutching his ribs, eyes wide and glassy. “Tom… get out…” he gasped, before collapsing against the wall.

The man turned toward me next. My body moved before my brain did. I grabbed the nearest thing—a fishing rod—and swung at his arm. He fired again, the blast tearing through the wall just inches from my head. I slammed the rod into his wrist, forcing the shotgun down, then wrenched it away. He staggered, muttering a single word:

“Victor.”

My hands shook. “Why, Victor? What’s wrong with you?”

He blinked slowly, voice flat, almost confused. “I don’t know.”

I threw the shotgun aside and shoved him backward into his boat. My thoughts were chaos—get help, get Alex, move—but Alex wasn’t moving. His chest barely rose once, then stilled. Ben was gone too, still floating outside like a shadow on the water.

I dragged them both into the boat, my arms trembling, every movement heavy. Victor just sat there, slumped, dazed. I untied his boat and shoved it away, then started ours, engine sputtering as we pulled into the channel.

The lake swallowed all sound but the hum of the motor. The weight of their bodies made the boat ride low. I looked back—Victor was stirring, reaching for something near the bench. Another gun. One of ours.

He raised it.

I dove, grabbing the barrel just as he pulled the trigger. The blast went wide, deafening, the flash lighting his face for a split second—blank, expressionless, like no one was home behind his eyes. I brought the gun down on his head as hard as I could. The crack was sickening. He went limp, blood streaking his forehead.

Rage and terror mixed inside me. I shoved him overboard, watching him splash into the shallows near the bank, tangled in cypress roots. He didn’t even scream, just drifted back, vanishing into the dark.

The ride back was endless. The boat’s small motor whined under the weight. I kept looking at Alex and Ben, whispering to them like they could still hear me. “Hold on, guys. Just hold on.” But their eyes stayed open, empty.

When I reached the ramp, there was no one—just silence and frost on the boards. I ran to the nearest house, banging on the door until a woman answered, half-asleep and terrified. “Please,” I gasped, “call the sheriff—my friends, they’ve been shot—”

She stared, hand over her mouth. “Oh, Lord.”

Within minutes, the night filled with sirens and red lights reflecting off the water. Deputies surrounded the boat. I sat on the ramp, shaking, my hands stiff and cold, their blood drying on my clothes.

“He just showed up,” I told them. “Said his name was Victor. Shot them both for no reason.”

They searched the lake, found the gun, the shell casings, the wreck of our night. Medics checked me over—just a graze and bruises—but I felt hollow, like something had been torn out.

They never found Victor alive. His boat turned up drifting two miles away. A few days later, hunters found his body tangled in roots near the bank. Hypothermia, maybe a head injury from the fall. No note, no motive. Just a man who’d snapped somewhere deep inside.

Weeks passed, but the lake never left me. The smell of the water, the echo of the blasts, the look on Alex’s face—it all plays on repeat in my head. I don’t go back there anymore. Our spot’s still out there, rotting quietly under the cypress, maybe still holding that stranger’s ghost.

Sometimes, late at night, I think about how fast it all turned. One moment, laughter and bait and friends. The next, silence and blood. And I wonder how someone could carry death so calmly—how close any of us might be to breaking without knowing it.

Because that’s what really haunts me.  
Not the gun. Not the screams.  
But the thought that anyone, anywhere, could just… snap.





# ""A Circle and a Cross"":

My girlfriend Lisa and I had been together for about a year when we decided to try night fishing at the lake. It was late September 1969, the air cool and still, with that faint smell of pine and water you only get before autumn truly sets in. We were both in college then—Lisa was twenty-two, studying art, with long brown hair and a laugh that seemed to make the world brighter. I was twenty, grinding through my second year of law school, and she always had this way of pulling me out of my books and into the world.

“Come on, David,” she said that afternoon, loading our tackle box into the trunk. “Fish bite better after dark. Besides, it’ll be romantic—just us under the stars.”

I smiled, even though I preferred fishing in daylight. But when she looked at me with that playful grin, I couldn’t say no. We packed a cooler of drinks, some sandwiches, and our rods, then drove the winding roads out to Lake Berryessa as the sun sank behind the hills.

We found a quiet peninsula, the kind that juts into the water like a finger, away from the usual camping spots. The air smelled faintly of mud and moss. Crickets hummed in the brush. We spread a blanket on the rocks and cast our lines, watching the last streaks of orange fade to purple.

“This is perfect,” Lisa whispered, leaning against me. “No one around, just the sound of the lake.”

I nodded, feeling her warmth against my side. For a while, we talked about school, about the future—maybe graduation, maybe marriage someday. “I’d want a small wedding,” she said softly. “By a lake like this.”

I squeezed her hand. “Sounds good to me.”

Hours passed. The moon climbed high, silvering the ripples. The lantern we’d brought threw a warm glow across the rocks. We didn’t care that the fish weren’t biting. It was quiet. Peaceful. Until Lisa stiffened beside me.

“David,” she whispered. “Do you see that?”

I followed her gaze toward the treeline behind us. About fifty yards away, a figure stood half-hidden in the dark, motionless. Just… watching.

“Probably another fisherman,” I said, though my stomach turned cold. But the figure didn’t move. Didn’t call out.

When I looked back again, he was gone. Then—closer—halfway between the trees and the shore, as if he’d melted from one shadow to the next.

Lisa’s voice trembled. “David, he’s coming this way.”

I grabbed the lantern and stood, the light cutting across the brush. The man stepped into view—tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in dark clothes. A strange hood covered his head, and beneath it, flat-topped sunglasses glinted in the light. A crude bib hung over his chest, painted with a white circle and a cross—like a gun’s sight.

He stopped ten feet from us.

“Don’t move,” he said. His voice was calm. Controlled.

Lisa gripped my arm.

“What do you want?” I asked, trying to sound steady.

“I’m an escaped prisoner from up north,” he said evenly. “I killed a guard to get out. I need your car keys and your money to get to Mexico.”

I felt Lisa shaking beside me. “Please,” she said. “Take it. Take everything.”

I reached slowly into my pocket, holding out my wallet. “Here. The keys are in there too.”

He took them—but didn’t leave. Instead, he pulled something from his jacket. Rope.

“Turn around,” he said. “I have to tie you up so you don’t follow me.”

Lisa’s voice cracked. “You don’t have to do this.”

“Turn around,” he repeated.

I gave her a small nod. Maybe if we stayed calm, he’d take the car and disappear. He handed Lisa the rope. “You tie him first.”

Her hands shook as she looped the cord around my wrists behind my back. “I’m sorry,” she whispered.

When she was done, he checked the knots—tightened them until they burned. Then he bound her, too, her breathing fast and shallow.

“Look,” I said, forcing the words out, “we won’t tell anyone. Just—just go.”

He didn’t answer.

The only sounds were the water lapping at the rocks and Lisa’s uneven breaths. The man stared at us through those dark lenses, then slowly reached beneath his bib. When his hand came out, it held a long knife, its blade catching the lantern light.

Lisa gasped. “Oh my God, please—”

“Wait!” I shouted. “You said you just needed the car!”

He stepped closer. The knife flashed.

Lisa screamed as he plunged it into her side. “David! Help!”

I twisted against the ropes, trying to break free, the fibers cutting into my wrists. I lunged toward him, but he turned and slashed at me, the blade ripping through my arm. Pain exploded. He drove it into my back—once, twice, again.

Lisa’s cries faded into wet gasps.

“Stop!” I yelled, blood filling my mouth. “Please!”

He didn’t stop. His breathing never changed—steady, almost mechanical. Then, as quickly as it began, it was over. He wiped the blade on his pants and turned, disappearing into the dark woods without a word.

For a moment, there was only the sound of the lake and the whisper of wind through the grass. Then I realized I was still alive.

I crawled toward Lisa, gnawing at the rope around my wrists until it loosened. “Lisa… Lisa, hold on.”

Her face was pale, her lips trembling. “It hurts,” she whispered.

“I know,” I said, freeing her hands. “Just stay with me.”

We screamed for help. Our voices echoed off the water, swallowed by the night.

A faint light appeared across the lake—then another. A fisherman’s boat, moving toward us.

“Over here!” I shouted with what little strength I had left.

They reached us minutes later—a man and his teenage son. “Dear God,” the man said, pulling us aboard. He wrapped us in jackets. “Hold on. We’ll get you to a hospital.”

Lisa turned her head weakly toward me. “I love you, David,” she whispered. Then her eyes closed.

I don’t remember much after that—just the sirens, the glare of hospital lights, the pain like fire in my chest. Six stab wounds, they told me. Lisa had ten. She didn’t make it.

When the police came, I told them everything: the hood, the circle-and-cross symbol, the calm voice, the fake story about the prison break. They found a message on my car door later—dates, words, and that same white symbol. They said it matched other killings.

They never caught him.

Years passed. The scars faded, but the memories never did. Sometimes, late at night, I still see him standing there at the edge of the trees—silent, waiting. And I hear Lisa’s voice, soft and distant, calling my name.

What started as a quiet night of fishing became something else entirely.  
The lake was so peaceful once—  
but evil found us there, waiting in the dark.





# ""The Inlet"":

We were a tight group—four friends who’d known each other long enough to finish each other’s sentences. My boyfriend, David, and I had been together for two years, both in our mid-twenties, and most weekends we found ourselves with Mark and his girlfriend, Sophie. Mark was a mechanic, all grease and loud laughter, while Sophie taught second grade, her calm presence grounding the rest of us.

That November weekend, we decided to escape the noise of work and city life, heading to a small lake on David’s family property. It wasn’t much—just a secluded patch of water surrounded by pine and birch—but it always felt like ours. We’d been there before, fishing under the stars, roasting marshmallows, talking until the fire burned low. It was the kind of place where time slowed down, where the world seemed far away.

We packed the truck with tents, rods, and a cooler full of beer and food, then drove out under a sky brushed with autumn clouds. By the time we arrived, the sun was sinking, and the lake shimmered gold. Sophie and I set up near the water’s edge, our boots sinking slightly into the soft ground. She handed me a bag of chips and smiled. “This is exactly what I needed. No lesson plans, no alarm clocks.”

Mark grinned as he stacked kindling. “Speak for yourself—I plan to put dinner on the fire tonight.”

David laughed and slung an arm around my shoulder. “You mean, after I catch it for you.”

We settled into an easy rhythm. Sophie and I unpacked food while the guys built a fire and got the rods ready. The lake mirrored the fading daylight, turning silver as the first stars appeared. We swam briefly in the chilly water, then huddled close around the fire as evening crept in.

By nightfall, we were sitting shoulder to shoulder on folding chairs, lines cast into the still water. The fishing was slow, but the conversation flowed—work, travel, stupid memories. Sophie told us about a student who insisted fish could fly if they “believed hard enough,” and we all burst out laughing. Mark caught one small catfish, held it up proudly, then tossed it back. “That one’s got a family,” he said.

Around midnight, the air grew cooler. Mist began to creep across the lake’s surface, wrapping the trees in a pale haze. We were about to pack up when we heard it—a low rumble coming down the dirt path.

A truck.

It stopped just beyond the treeline, headlights cutting through the fog. A tall man stepped out, wearing a worn jacket and a friendly half-smile. “Evening,” he called, raising a hand. “Name’s Will. Sorry to bother you—saw your fire from the road. You folks stuck or something?”

David stood, brushing dirt off his jeans. “Nah, just camping. Got the truck out earlier.”

Will nodded, glancing toward the lake. “Good spot you’ve got here. I live down the ridge—been fishing these waters for years. Mind if I join for a bit?”

David hesitated, then offered a beer. “Sure, pull up a chair.”

Will accepted with an easy grin, settling near the fire. At first, he seemed harmless enough. He talked about fishing, about how the deeper parts of the lake were better after midnight. His voice was calm, his eyes steady. If there was something off about him, none of us noticed.

“You folks come here often?” he asked after a while.

Sophie smiled politely. “David’s family owns this land. We’ve been coming since last summer.”

Will nodded slowly, poking at the fire with a stick. “That’s nice. Always good to have a quiet place away from people.”

We chatted another half hour. He even helped Mark fix a tangled reel, quick and sure with his hands. “That should hold,” he said, smiling faintly. Then, almost casually, he added, “There’s a better fishing spot at the inlet. Deep water. You’d get bigger catfish this time of night.”

Mark’s eyes lit up. “Let’s check it out. What do you think?”

Sophie looked uneasy. “Maybe we just stay here—it’s late.”

I hesitated too, but David shrugged. “It’s close, right?”

“Just a short walk,” Will said. “Five minutes, tops.”

So they went—David, Mark, Sophie, and Will—disappearing between the trees with their flashlights flickering like fireflies. I stayed behind to tend the fire, promising to join them soon.

The night stretched quiet again. Crickets, wind through leaves, the soft lap of water. I stared at the flames, absently poking at the logs. Then I heard it.

A sharp *pop*.

Then another.

At first, I thought it might be fireworks. Or maybe something falling in the woods. But then came a third—louder, closer. Gunshots.

My body went rigid. “David?” I called softly. No answer. The air seemed to hold its breath.

I grabbed the flashlight and stepped toward the trees. The beam trembled as I moved. Another sound—a branch breaking. I froze. And then Will stepped out of the dark. Alone.

He had a gun in his hand.

For a second, he didn’t see me. The firelight flickered over his face—calm, expressionless. He walked toward the tents, muttering under his breath. “Where are you?”

I ducked behind a bush, holding my breath so tight my chest hurt. He rummaged through our gear, tossing things aside, then dragged something heavy toward his truck. My stomach turned when I saw—an arm, a flash of denim, blood glinting under the moonlight.

He loaded them into the truck, one by one, humming softly to himself. When he finally drove off, the night went dead silent again, save for the distant rumble of the engine fading down the road.

I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t think. I just ran.

Into the woods, stumbling, gasping, tripping over roots and rocks. When I found them—David, Mark, and Sophie—it didn’t feel real. David lay on his back, eyes open to the stars, blood staining his shirt. Mark was slumped beside him. Sophie’s fishing rod was still in her hand, her hair spread across the dirt.

I fell to my knees, shaking, choking on sobs that wouldn’t come out right. Then instinct took over. I ran again—deeper, farther, until the woods swallowed me whole. I hid there all night, curled beneath the leaves, shaking so hard I thought my bones would crack. Every sound felt like footsteps, every gust of wind like breath on my neck.

When dawn finally came, pale and cold, I crept back toward the lake. My phone was still in the tent. My hands shook as I dialed.

“Please,” I whispered when the dispatcher answered. “My friends are dead. A man shot them.”

The sirens came fast—echoing through the forest, breaking the stillness. Police found them where I’d said. They searched Will’s property and found his truck, blood on the tailgate, the weapon buried beneath a pile of scrap.

He barricaded himself for a while, then surrendered. He claimed it was a misunderstanding, that he thought we were trespassing, that he “panicked.” But there was no misunderstanding—he’d gained our trust, watched us, and lured them away.

The trial dragged on for months. I took the stand, voice shaking as I relived every sound, every second. When the verdict came—guilty, sentenced to death—it didn’t bring peace. Nothing could.

I don’t camp anymore. Don’t fish.

Sometimes I still hear the gunshots in my dreams, echoing across the lake. I see David’s face in the firelight, smiling at me, just before he turned to follow that man into the trees.

The lake was once our refuge. Now, it’s a place I can’t bear to think about. Evil doesn’t always come screaming out of the dark. Sometimes, it walks right up to your fire, smiles, and asks for a beer.





# ""Gone Before Dawn"":

The outing began as a simple escape—just a break from the grind. We’d been talking about it for weeks over coffee, the kind of half-serious plans friends make when life gets too heavy. My longtime buddy Tom was the one who pushed it into motion. “Let’s do a midnight fishing run,” he said one night. “Just like old times. No phones, no work, no noise. Just us.”

Tom was thirty-one, steady, the kind of guy who never missed his daughter’s school plays or forgot an anniversary. He’d married Denise right after college, and they seemed like one of those couples who had it all figured out. Our other friend, Brian, jumped on board right away. He sold insurance, had a sharp tongue and a knack for turning small talk into persuasion. “I’ll bring the boat,” Brian said. “We’ll fill that cooler before sunrise.”

So that Friday night, around ten, we loaded up Tom’s truck—rods, bait, a few beers, and a small cooler of food—and hit the backroads leading out to the lake. The world grew darker the farther we drove, the trees leaning over the narrow lanes like a tunnel. Tom talked easily, about his work appraising properties and how he was trying to spend more time with his family. “Denise wants another baby,” he said, a soft smile in the glow of the dash lights.

Brian, sitting behind him, gave a low chuckle. “You’ve got a good life, man,” he said. But there was something in his tone—something flat and strange. I remember glancing back, wondering if I’d misheard.

When we reached the lake, it was still and silver under the moon. Not a ripple, not a sound but frogs and wind. We launched the small aluminum boat and drifted out, the motor coughing once before quieting. “This is it,” Tom said, breathing deep. “This is peace.”

We fished in easy silence for a while, broken only by small talk and the plop of lines hitting the water. Tom caught the first catfish—a good-sized one. “Still got the magic touch,” he grinned, holding it up for us to see. We cheered, laughed, the sound echoing across the still surface. I caught a smaller one next. Brian teased me for letting it go, and I tossed him a look.

Then, as the hours wore on, the conversation turned quieter, more personal. Brian brought up high school memories—how he and Denise used to hang out back then. “She was a good friend,” he said, his voice dropping almost to a whisper. Tom smiled. “Still is,” he replied, unaware of the tension building in that exchange. I noticed Brian looking away, jaw tight, and a cold, inexplicable unease crept into my gut.

By two in the morning, the moon hung high and pale. A light mist began to settle over the lake. “Let’s move closer to the stumps,” Brian suggested, taking the tiller. “Bigger ones hang there.” Tom stood up to adjust his line, balancing easily in his waders.

Then everything shifted in an instant.

Brian stood, too—his face changed, no warmth left in it. “Tom,” he said quietly.

Tom looked over. “What’s up?”

And before either of us could react, Brian shoved him—hard. Tom stumbled backward and went over the side, hitting the water with a splash. “Brian! What the hell!” I shouted, reaching for him, but Brian was already reaching under his seat. When his hand came up, it was holding the shotgun Tom had brought for protection against coyotes.

“Don’t,” I said, backing away.

Brian’s voice was low, trembling, but cold. “This has to happen.”

Tom surfaced, sputtering, clinging to a stump. “Help me up, Brian! Come on, man!”

The sound that came next was deafening. A single blast echoed across the lake. Tom jerked, blood rippling out around him. His fingers slipped from the stump. And then—he was gone.

I screamed his name, lunged at Brian, grappling for the gun. The boat rocked violently. “Why?!” I yelled. “What did you do?”

“For the insurance,” Brian spat, shoving me back. His face twisted with something like desperation. “Denise and I—she wants out. We both do. The policy’s worth a million.”

The words hit me harder than the gun ever could. Denise. His wife. My friend’s wife.

I swung, my fist catching him across the jaw. The gun went off again, the blast searing my shoulder. Pain exploded through me, and I stumbled backward, losing my balance. The icy water swallowed me whole, knocking my breath away. My head slammed against a stump, stars bursting behind my eyes.

Above, the engine roared to life. Brian looked down at me, expression unreadable. “I’m sorry,” he said—and fired once more. The bullet missed as I ducked under. Then the boat turned, the motor whining, and he sped off into the darkness.

I surfaced, gasping, clinging to the stump where Tom had been moments earlier. The pain in my shoulder throbbed with every heartbeat. Somehow, my phone was still in my pocket, sealed in its waterproof case. My fingers were shaking too hard to type, so I hit redial and prayed.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Help…” My voice cracked. “Lake… shot… my friend’s dead…”

They kept me talking, guiding me to describe the shoreline lights I could barely see through the fog. By the time the rescue boats arrived, I was half-conscious, teeth chattering uncontrollably. They hauled me out, wrapped me in blankets, and I passed out before we reached the dock.

Tom’s body was recovered an hour later.

In the days that followed, the story unraveled. Brian confessed quickly under pressure. The affair with Denise had been going on for years. Together, they’d forged paperwork and bought a life insurance policy naming her the sole beneficiary. The fishing trip was never meant to end with three men returning.

Their trials took over a year, but both were convicted—murder, conspiracy, fraud. I sat in court, my arm in a sling, staring at the two of them as they avoided my eyes.

I still can’t bring myself to visit that lake. Some nights, when the wind picks up and the water outside my window shifts in the moonlight, I hear the echo of that gunshot again—and see Tom’s face disappear beneath the surface.",1,1762240486.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

The past 3-4 weeks I've been getting an overpowering ""bean oil""(?) taste. It's chemically but not the usual under or over extracted taste that I'm used to. I regularly descale the delonghi and clean the removable parts in espresso machine cleaner (cafiza equivalent) and in the past 3 weeks have put 3 doses of ""cleaning bean pellets"" through the grinder.

I've put the delonghi in to a service centre see if there's something wrong with it (I feel like it's not getting up to temperature) but it's come back with a clean bill of health .. but the shots still have ""the taste"". The service centre said I should ""buy higher quality beans"". I get freshly roasted beans and wait until they're around 10 days post roast. I know what too new or too old beans tastes like...

I've been very analytical with the issue and have used kilos of beans trying different dose, ratio, timing, grind and even when they're bitter or sour they still have this other overpowering taste. I've tried 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3 and everything in between. I usually shoot for a 30 second shot including preinfusion. I've got records of the trials .. and I would think at least one of them would produce a half decent shot that even if it's not ""nice"" is passable. I've used the same beans I've always used as well as a dozen other beans to try to find the sweet spot. The recipe I've used for 10 months no longer produces nice coffee, but neither does any other recipe I try.

Grinder cleaning that I do now .. pull the hopper off the grinder (washed that in warm soapy water and dried well), and give the burrs a brush and a tissue up the chute. The dosing cup gets cleaned every other day. The outside is cleaned every day to remove dust. Only recently have I put cleaning pellets through the grinder.

I have very low to no retention .. 20g goes in 20g comes out.

I'm kinda scared to pull more of the grinder apart because I don't want to misalign anything. Is that my next step? (or finding someone to do it for me ..)",2,1762240281.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Relief goods, rice prepositioned in Tacloban City, seven Leyte towns - Former Speaker Romualdez, Tingog Party-list

THE offices of former Speaker Ferdinand Martin G. Romualdez of Leyte’s 1st District and Tingog Party-list have prepositioned rice and essential relief goods across Tacloban City and seven municipalities in Leyte to ensure immediate support for families who may be affected by Typhoon Tino (international name: Kalmaegi).

Romualdez said Tingog personnel and volunteers delivered initial stocks to Palo, Tanauan, Tolosa, Sta. Fe, Alang-alang, San Miguel, and Babatngon as part of the group’s preparedness efforts.

He emphasized that “preparedness remains a top priority to protect vulnerable communities, especially in coastal and low-lying barangays.”

Tingog said each municipality will receive noodles, sardines, biscuits, coffee, Energen, and rice to the towns of Palo, Tanauan, Alang-alang, Tolosa, Sta. Fe, San Miguel, and Babatngon.

The group said the relief effort is part of a broader preparedness initiative, with a total of 15,000 kilograms of rice already prepositioned for deployment should the situation escalate.

Relief supplies prepared also include 110 boxes of noodles, 80 boxes of sardines, 20 boxes of Energen, 25 boxes of biscuits, and 80 boxes of coffee.

The team also began distributing hot meals to evacuees arriving at various evacuation centers in Tacloban City on Monday afternoon as part of its ongoing relief and readiness operations.

The food distribution aims to provide comfort and sustenance to families seeking temporary shelter due to bad weather, Tingog said.

As of Monday night, about 3,000 hot meals had been served to evacuees in Tacloban, according to Tingog.

The group added that the feeding operation will continue Tuesday in the city and nearby towns to ensure that displaced residents receive warm meals and immediate support during the weather disturbance.

Tingog Party-list is represented in the House of Representatives by Reps. Yedda K. Romualdez, Andrew Julian K. Romualdez, and Jude A. Acidre.

“We want every family to be ready and no one left struggling when bad weather comes,” Leyte Rep. Romualdez said. 

“We want to move fast and be present even before the storm arrives,” Rep. Andrew Romualdez said. 

Acidre underscored that proactive relief positioning remains crucial in disaster-prone Eastern Visayas, particularly in light of recent weather advisories.

“We prepositioned these supplies to ensure families will not go hungry and to enable immediate delivery of support during emergencies,” Acidre said. 

The offices of Rep. Martin Romualdez and Tingog will send additional deliveries in the coming days as part of their ongoing readiness operations.",1,1762240257.0,PilipinasUnfiltered,0,1.0,False

I do my best every day to give them food, shelter, and love, but lately it’s been really hard to afford enough cat food for all of them. I don’t run a shelter or receive any funding — it’s just me trying to keep them safe and fed.

If anyone is able to help with food donations or even small support, it would mean the world to me and the cats. I can share proof, photos, and donation links privately (PayPal, Ko-fi, or Buy Me a Coffee).

Today, my day job is in the AI writing tools space. I review, test, and troubleshoot these platforms for teams and individuals weekly. And honestly, I see writers making the exact same mistakes with AI - especially with tools like Copy.ai - over and over.

**Here are 5 most common mistakes I see (and what to do instead):**

**1. Believing ""user-friendly"" means reliable and professional.**  
Copy.ai’s interface is simple, but a smooth dashboard hides serious problems - like bugs and random tool crashes. Many writers get wooed by easy onboarding, then get stuck when features stop working (with little to no customer support).

**2. Trusting subscriptions and credit “limits” will motivate you.**  
Most users lose unused credits each month. You pay for a plan, but if you get busy or just don’t need content, your credits vanish. It’s buyer’s remorse, every month.

**3. Expecting instant support or refunds.**  
Customer service is Copy.ai’s #1 reported pain. Slow email replies, canned responses, and difficulties canceling subscriptions create stress and waste your time. Serious writers need reliable support - a feature many AI platforms ignore.

**4. Assuming you’ll never need to manage technical hiccups.**  
Features break randomly (and stay broken), making it risky to rely on Copy.ai for paid or deadline work. This instability is a deal-breaker when consistency is key.

**5. Focusing on “all the features” over finished, stable tools.**  
Copy.ai releases lots of templates quickly, but half-finished features increase frustration. Most pros I work with need stable core tools, not a laundry list of buggy add-ons.

**My quick, hard-learned lessons for writers using AI:**

- Demo first, don’t pay up front. Test any platform for bugs, support response, and credit policies before committing to paid plans.
- Don’t skip on proofreading. AI-generated content must be edited and “humanized” - it’s rarely ready out-of-the-box.
- Prioritize platforms with clear, one-time payment options and real human support.
- Always track your credit usage; avoid tools where unused credits expire.
- The best tools complement writing, not replace it. Use AI for drafts and research, but trust your voice for revisions.

You can read the complete detailed guide in the link I'll share in the first comment.

If you want to avoid painful lessons from someone who’s spent the time in the trenches - don’t repeat these mistakes. Your writing and sanity will thank you!",1,1762239894.0,studytips,1,1.0,False

It is so hard to tell the difference 😑. I stupidly got curious about gluten and dairy. Theory was would imported gluten items and dairy items make me sick? Many people travel to Italy and feel great then come back here and don’t. 

I’m Italian so I miss pasta. Gluten free pasta is not bad but nothing beats the real thing. So I got curious. For 3 weeks I had imported pasta from Italy and Parmesan and Marinara. 

I got chocolate from Switzerland because I love real milk chocolate lattes ugh so good to take some chocolate poor coffee over it oh my gosh!! 

I got some brioche from France.

No joke I felt really good actually and I was expecting it to not go so good. I was shocked. None of my usual oh no I ate gluten and or dairy classics like joint pain, itchy skin, or flu like symptoms. 

I was like ok cool now ima go try not processed products here like A2 dairy and some fresh bread from the bakery. 

It’s been 3 days and I feel terrible. Tonight my stomach is like what did you do to me!? Doc did a video talking about how our wheat has folic acid and many can’t handle it so maybe it’s not a gluten thing for everyone? Or maybe the gluten there is like less harsh or something?

Now I’m like ugh I need to detox idk what is in/not in food in other countries that is here but it is wild. Part of me wants to go back to eating imported food. I worked sooo hard to budget it for my normal weekly food budget and was successful. My hubby even hopped on board and he was like wow I feel really good too! He was able to eat Marinara without heartburn and he hasn’t been able to do this with organic Marinara here.

1oo0jx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1oo0jx2/minimalism/,Minimalism,"Back in '21, I packed up my whole life into a tiny car and just left for destinations unknown. I didn't know it at the time, but it would turn into 4+ years of a long road trip, essentially. I lived out of a suitcase, carried my essentials with me and stayed in homes, hotels/motels, Airbnb's, and camped. 

Now, I've finally settled down (we'll see how long it lasts lol). I have my own unfurnished apartment and a real job I have to go to 5 days a week. But I'm still living my minimalist lifestyle. 

Furnishings; I have one bed, two nightstands, a lamp, a TV and stand with game console, a small plastic 3 drawer thing, a table and 2 chairs. My living room is empty and I use it for storage. 

I am still using the one plate, two bowls (one small, one large), one set of silverware and 2 small knives I've been carrying with me for years. Even tho I have the room, I see no need for anything else. When I use my stuff, I either immediately wash it, or I have to wash it next time I eat. I have added a couple of things: a small air fryer, a microwave and coffee maker, but still have just one coffee cup and one tumbler. I don't cook that much but I do have one frying pan and a pizza pan and cutter.

I have one bath towel and one washcloth. One dish towel, one hand towel.

For clothing, I have two muumuus, 2 sun dresses, 3 pairs of shorts and half a dozen tank tops. A couple of tshirts and 2 pairs of pants and tops for work. Laundry and dishes never get a chance to pile up.  It's still somewhat of a struggle to do other things like vacuuming and mopping, but fortunately I like my space empty and clean so I never let it get too bad. 

I'm not sure how practical this lifestyle would be for a lot of people, but it really works for me and I feel more in control of my life and surroundings than I ever have before. I highly recommend downsizing if possible.

1oo0j8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_dentgoalievehicle/comments/1oo0j8j/car_door_dents_are_the_real_enemy_whats_your/,Car Door Dents Are the Real Enemy. What's Your Protection Strategy?,"If you have ever stepped out of a store, coffee shop, or gym and spotted a fresh dent on your car door, you know the feeling. Your stomach sinks, frustration kicks in, and you start replaying the moment you parked. Was it the car beside you? Was it the shopping cart? Did someone swing their door into yours and walk away without a second thought?

Door dents are the silent enemy of every car owner. They don’t seem catastrophic at first glance, but over time they can become an expensive and frustrating problem. In the US, crowded parking lots, tight garage spaces, and careless drivers make it almost impossible to avoid the occasional ding. This is exactly why [**car door dent protection**](https://dentgoalie.com/coupes-and-sedans-car-door-protection/) is no longer optional; it is essential.

And it is the reason many car owners have started turning to smart solutions like **car door guards, car door protectors,** [magnetic car door guards](https://dentgoalie.com/best-magnetic-car-door-dent-protector-texas/), and **removable car door guards** to make sure their vehicle stays in pristine condition. Among the most innovative options in this space is Dentgoalie, a brand designed to protect against everyday door dents so your vehicle keeps its showroom appeal longer.

Let us explore why car door dents are such a problem, and the best strategies to defend your vehicle.

# Why Car Door Dents Matter More Than You Think

https://preview.redd.it/txcuioc6s6zf1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a24c869331aeead2821462eff8a42b387db2095b

To many people, a dent might seem like a minor inconvenience. But if you care about your car’s appearance, its value, and long-term durability, those door dings are a serious threat. Repairing even one small dent can cost anywhere from $150 to $500 depending on size and paint impact. Larger dents or chipped areas quickly escalate into body shop bills that run into thousands.

But here is the real concern: paint damage from a dent exposes raw metal. Once metal is exposed, moisture and air slowly begin a corrosion process. Rust doesn’t show up immediately; it sneaks in silently. Before you know it, one small ding has turned into a spreading rust patch that compromises the vehicle’s structure and resale value.

A dent isn’t just cosmetic. It is the beginning of what could become a much bigger issue. That is why [door dent protection](https://dentgoalie.com/shop/) is a smart investment rather than a luxury.

# Modern Problems Require Modern Protection

Cars today are engineered better than ever. But no manufacturer has solved one everyday problem, protecting doors in parking spaces. Tight modern parking layouts, oversized SUVs, and impatient drivers create the perfect recipe for damage.

Thankfully, this is also where modern **car door protectors** and **door ding protectors** step in. Today's solutions are sleek, removable, paint-safe, and easy to use. They don’t rely on old-school bulky bumpers or ugly foam blocks. Instead, innovations like **magnetic car door guards** and **removable car door guards** allow drivers to protect their vehicle only when needed and store the guards when traveling.

This flexibility is exactly what makes brands like **Dentgoalie** stand out. The Dentgoalie design is engineered specifically for modern parking realities, allowing you to attach protection in seconds and remove it effortlessly, without damaging paint or leaving residue. It is the kind of smart protection that gives every car owner peace of mind.

# Understanding the Main Causes of Door Dents

Door dents rarely happen by accident. They almost always come from the same culprits.

Another car door swings too wide. A child opens a door without looking. A runaway shopping cart bumps your door in the grocery store lot. Or, in tight apartment or office parking, someone squeezes out of their car and leaves a dent without a second thought.

When you park in the wrong spot, even for a short time, your car becomes vulnerable. But here is the thing, you don't always know when you are in a high-risk spot until it is too late. That is why having **car door guards** ready is essential if you park in public areas frequently.

With solutions like [**Dentgoalie**](https://dentgoalie.com/contact-us/) in your trunk, you don’t have to rely on luck. You create your own dent-free reality.

# The Smart Way to Stop Door Dents Before They Happen

Car owners today are not just reacting to dents. They are preventing them. It is no different than using screen protectors on your phone, the best way to avoid damage is to stop it before it starts.

There are many strategies to protect your vehicle from dents, but a few stand out because they are practical and effective.

One of the most reliable ways is using **car door dent protectors** made specifically for impact resistance. Magnetic and removable solutions are especially popular because they do not permanently change the look of your car and can be used only when needed.

**Magnetic car door guards**, for example, attach directly to the metal surface and stay secure. Meanwhile, **removable car door guards** are perfect for vehicles with mixed materials or where flexibility is important. Dentgoalie combines durability, convenience, and design, making it easy to apply protection wherever you park.

# Why More Car Owners Trust Magnetic & Removable Guards

https://preview.redd.it/lf7uj7m7s6zf1.png?width=3780&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7004a01495b5d9d037d7f65b412b58dc5a95513

There is a reason the US market is seeing a surge in interest for **magnetic car door guards** and **removable car door guards**.

They are practical. They don’t damage paint. They are reusable. And they offer protection exactly when and where you need it.

Permanent stick-on protectors don’t work for everyone. Not every car owner wants adhesive devices attached permanently, because they can alter the car’s aesthetic or leave marks over time. Magnetic and removable guards solve this problem by giving car owners total control.

Imagine heading into a crowded mall, an airport parking structure, or a city street. With Dentgoalie, you simply attach the guard before walking away. No anxiety. No hoping the car next to you is careful. You have already protected your investment.

# How Dentgoalie Stands Out in the Protection Game

https://preview.redd.it/m6rkh239s6zf1.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edb318769558bcaa9beff72d8e6ddf36e061eb9e

The challenge with many general car door protectors is that they are not designed specifically for the realities of American parking. They either don’t stay in place, are too bulky, or they lack the durability needed for everyday use.

Dentgoalie addresses these issues by offering a solution created specifically to withstand real-world conditions while protecting car paint and panels. It combines a simple use process with robust materials that absorb impact instead of transferring it.

Instead of hoping the driver next to you cares about your car, Dentgoalie allows you to take matters into your own hands. That is the kind of peace of mind car owners appreciate, knowing they won’t return to an unpleasant surprise.

# Practical Tips to Stop Door Dents Before They Start

Protection goes beyond the device you use. Smart parking habits also matter.

Whenever possible, park beside pillars or open spaces. Choose end-spots to reduce the number of cars next to you. Avoid tight parking near shopping cart return areas. And if you must park in crowded places, that is the perfect moment to pull out **Dentgoalie** and apply your **car door protectors**.

Protection becomes a habit, and once you start using door dent guards regularly, you will wonder how you ever parked without them.

# Final Thoughts: The Best Defense Is Preparation

Car door dents may seem like a small inconvenience, but they cause long-term damage, frustration, and expensive repairs. Instead of reacting to every ding, smart drivers today focus on prevention.

The simple truth is this: you can’t control the behavior of others in parking lots. But you can control your defense strategy. With modern solutions like **magnetic car door guards**, **removable car door guards**, and dedicated brands like **Dentgoalie**, protecting your car from dents has never been easier or more effective.

Your car is an investment worth protecting. Don’t leave it up to chance. Equip yourself, park confidently, and avoid those frustrating surprises forever.

Every few weeks there is a new “bootcamp”, “course”, “academy”, “learn UI/UX in 8 weeks”, ""master-class"" blah blah kinda thing popping up.

and like, cool, i get it. learning is good. education is important yada yada.

but bro….. we are not short on people LEARNING neither short on people knowing how to use figma or any other tool, we are ACTUALLY short on people who can actually DO THE WORK. 

like, half the “certified designers” I see can make beautiful Dribbble shots, gradients, glassmorphism, no doubt it looks amazning n all, but ask them to design something usable? for real users? in a real team? For an actual client? how to handle design decisions and dev handoffs? they get stuck/confused or where to get started, what to do, how to handle client/business expectations, communications issues, etcc .

same for devs tbh. they can write code but cant deploy a working UI without bugs and errors, and they just change the design totally, miss features, and starting going to Chatgpt to find solutions for everything (cant even do that properly)

And then everyone is just…... stuck. Freshers cant get jobs. Companies dont wanna hire freshers. working people feel like they are plateauing. And managers are like “why do I have to explain how to handoff a Figma file properly??”

And in the middle of all this, AI is out here doing junior-level work FASTER than humans. (even though it has its own flaws).

So like,  what’s even the point of another 3-month course that teaches you only color theory and “how to design buttons/gradients”?

what if instead of more courses we had something like a real accelerator or maybe mentors, something like a Y Combinator but for talents maybe, to handhold them and help them ACTAULLY learn by working, real projects, real deadlines, real feedback, real teamwork, how actually real pressure in different situations feels like, not just some bs made-up “case studies”.

Avoid heavy, oily, or fried foods they make you sleepy and sluggish. Stick to light homemade meals with balanced nutrients.

 2. Focus on Complex Carbs

Eat energy-sustaining foods like brown rice, oats, whole wheat, poha, or millets. They release energy slowly and help you stay focused for long hours.

 3. Include Fresh Fruits and Veggies

Fruits like bananas, apples, and oranges keep glucose levels stable. Green veggies help your brain function better due to their high vitamin content.

 4. Stay Hydrated

Drink enough water, coconut water, or lemon water throughout the day. Even mild dehydration can reduce concentration and cause fatigue.

 5. Eat Brain-Boosting Snacks

During study breaks, munch on nuts (almonds, walnuts), seeds, or dark chocolate. These contain omega-3s and antioxidants that boost memory and alertness.

6. Limit Caffeine

A cup or two of tea/coffee is fine, but avoid overuse  too much caffeine can cause anxiety and disturb your sleep.

7. Avoid Late-Night Eating

If you study late, go for something light like fruit, yogurt, or soup. Heavy meals at night reduce sleep quality and next-day focus.

8. Add Protein in Every Meal

Proteins help in maintaining steady energy and concentration. Include eggs, paneer, lentils, sprouts, tofu, or lean meat in your diet.

 9. Use Herbal or Green Tea

Replace sugary drinks with green tea or chamomile tea — they help reduce stress and improve alertness naturally.


10. Eat on Time, Stay Consistent

Your body performs best on routine. Eat at the same time every day  it keeps your digestion, focus, and mood balanced before the exam.",5,1762238307.0,CATiim,2,0.86,False

Feel free to use my spreadsheet. I’ll be updating it with new strategies and new websites whenever I find ones that work. I’ll explain below the exact strategy I use to maximize profit.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRN4CcSmhWzRHIMuz75cKpH76ywP8aG5EdFIDPaAF\_2oDg85HnrlssN3VOmyNa4mMfQH1JdzWtvcy5\_/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRN4CcSmhWzRHIMuz75cKpH76ywP8aG5EdFIDPaAF_2oDg85HnrlssN3VOmyNa4mMfQH1JdzWtvcy5_/pubhtml)

**Step 1:** I log into every casino from my spreadsheet each morning while having my coffee, and the first thing I do is check for any sale or deal. These are usually offers like “Get 50 SC coins for $16.99.” When I find one, I buy the deal and take the 50 SC coins, which must be played at least once before they can be redeemed. I then use those SC coins on high “return to player” (RTP) games, usually table games like roulette, where I have a good chance of breaking even while meeting the play-through requirement. I usually just buy every deal I like throughout a week or two to stack as many SC coins as I can. Then I’ll spend one evening every now and then playing through and washing all the coins I bought throughout the week.  
I aim to cash out with a 95% RTP, so if I buy 100 SC, I aim to cash out with $95, which I achieve basically every time. (I’ll add specific game strategies at the bottom.)

**Important:** Make sure to buy the sign-up bonus deals. These deals are usually 100%–300% more SC than you spend. 300% deals are somewhat rare, so make sure to buy these ones so you don’t have to wait a few weeks for the next very high offer. This is something I didn’t do when I first started because I was skeptical and thought there was some catch where the website wouldn’t let me cash out. But once I realized that cashing out is easy and works, I started buying all future sign-up bonuses.

**Step 2:** Next, I collect my daily rewards. Most of these sweepstakes websites offer a reward for consistently logging in every day. You’ll get a daily bonus of $0.50–$1 as long as you keep logging in. $0.50–$1 isn’t very much, but when you have a list of 30 websites, each daily bonus adds up over time.  
**Tip:** Some websites have progressive systems where day one you get $0.20, day two $0.40, and by day seven you get $2. It ensures you log in every day and averages out to $0.50–$1 per day.

**Step 3:** The third thing I do is grind the VIP programs to increase my daily bonus. You’ll also get some free SC coins every time you level up in a VIP program. What I’ll do is, if I’m working remotely for the day, I’ll open a few of these websites and find the highest RTP slot on each one. Then I’ll do auto spins with gold coins. I usually spin less than 1% of the total gold coins amount and just let it run all day. On some of these websites, it can take a while to upgrade your VIP, but it only takes a couple of minutes to set up, and I just minimize the tab and let it run in the background.

**Step 4:** Cashing out. I was skeptical when I started and thought this wouldn’t work, but I was surprised when I easily cashed out all my winnings. Most of these have a minimum amount you can redeem, usually $50, so you can’t cash out your daily bonus every day. You’ll get larger sums of money randomly throughout the month instead. Some websites offer gift cards that you can redeem, and these minimums are usually around $10–$20. Personally, I’ve never redeemed a gift card because I just want the cash so I can use it to pay my monthly expenses. Cashing out usually takes 12 to 72 hours, so don’t worry when it’s not immediately in your bank account like I did the first time.

This is not a get-rich-quick plan or necessarily scalable, but getting a couple of grand a month by spending 15 minutes a day logging in, collecting bonuses, and buying sales is something I’ll take any day.

**Strategies I use:**

**Roulette:** I bet 1 SC coin on all 37 numbers. Sure, I’ll lose 1 SC coin per spin, but when I’m buying deals and collecting my free bonuses, I’m still cashing out 95%+ of the original SC coins I had. This one is fast because you can wash over 100 coins in just a few spins.

**Slots:** Not my favorite because you can have long losing streaks, but I still cash out with a good profit about 95% of the time using slots. I look up the highest RTP slots online and then check the websites to see which of those slots they have. Some websites only offer slots, so you need to use this strategy sometimes, but I generally stay away from it if I can.

**Originals (My go To):** I’m not sure what to call these, but these are games like Mines or Dice. I set up auto-spin on these games, and for Mines, I’ll choose one mine and only pick one square. The same logic applies to Dice: I set the win percentage as high as possible (96%+) and turn auto-spin on. This is my go-to method because you can bet 1 SC and win 1.04 SC, and it still counts toward washing the whole SC you bet.

**Live Table Games:** I prefer Baccarat, but Blackjack works well too. These games have a slightly under 50% chance of winning a hand (around 49.5%), but if you play enough hands, you’ll wash all your SC coins and only lose a few depending on how many you’re playing.

**Disclaimers:**

 You can lose money doing this. The strategy I use minimizes this risk, and personally, I’ve made at least a few hundred dollars profit every month I’ve done this, but you can go on long losing streaks trying to wash your SC coins. I wouldn’t necessarily say this is free money with no risk. Just be careful, stick to your plan, and don’t randomly gamble your SC coins, and it’ll increase your chances of being profitable.

I have also been doing this for Over 8 months, and my VIP daily bonuses will be higher than yours for now so the rewards on the sheet may be higher than what you see right now for some websites",13,1762238115.0,passive_income,5,0.88,False

1oo0ahn,https://i.redd.it/gb84op1bp6zf1.jpeg,Your Stress-Free Guide to AI Mining: SAHOP Made Simple,"Are you confused by AI and talk of crypto mining? It all sounds so technical and overwhelming. What if you could benefit from this technology without needing to be an expert?

The SAHOP AI Mining program is designed to do just that. Think of it as your own hands-free business, powered by artificial intelligence. Let's break it down in the simplest terms.

# Your Own Business, Powered by AI Bots

Imagine you’ve decided to start a business. What’s the first thing you need? An office.

* **Your Virtual Office:** The **Pamper Me Network** provides you with a SAHOP virtual office for a surprisingly low yearly fee.

Now, what does every office need? Equipment and staff. This is where the AI magic happens.

* **Your Office Equipment:** You need computers and phones. There’s an **AI Bot** for that.
* **Your Marketing Team:** You need to get the word out. There’s an **AI Bot** for that.
* **Your Accountant:** You need someone to handle the money. There’s an **AI Bot** for that.
* **Your Sales Team:** This is a key part. You need a full staff for sales. There’s an **AI Bot** for that, too.

# How It Works: Set It and Forget It

The SAHOP program is built on a simple premise. You pay to hire your core **AI Staffing** for a minimum of six months. After this period, the revenue generated is designed to cover your costs and begin providing you with a net benefit.

The best part? Once you start your SAHOP (Stand Alone, Hands-free, Operating Program), you need to do nothing else. Your AI staff runs the business for you.

* **No technical knowledge needed.**
* **You don’t need to do anything.**
* **Your earnings are calculated and sent to you each month.**

This hands-off approach is especially beneficial for women, who have often found that technology wasn't designed with their needs and lifestyles in mind. SAHOP changes that by putting a simple, manageable tool directly in their hands.

# The Major Advantage: Peace of Mind

How is SAHOP AI Mining different from stocks or other similar platforms?

With traditional investing platforms, the markets go up and down. You could be thrilled with your profits one day, only to wake up the next morning and find that market fluctuations have wiped them out.

**Not so with SAHOP AI Mining.**

While you may not see wild, overnight fortunes, the wealth you build by your AI Mining Staff is stable. The value you go to bed with is the value you wake up with. SAHOP is not tied to the stressful rollercoaster of market exchanges or similar platforms. This provides a **locked-in peace of mind** that other projects  can't always offer.

# Your Key to a Calmer Future

Your AI staff never takes a coffee break, a day off, or a holiday. They are designed to give you back your precious time. They return to you the freedom to enjoy a longer break, sleep in, or spend more quality time with family—all without the stress of managing a business.

SAHOP AI Mining presents itself as a potential **additional, non-stressful revenue stream**, which can be particularly appealing for those thinking about their retirement plans. It allows you to build for the future without interrupting your present life.

**Don't let confusion or fear hold you back.** SAHOP AI Mining is your simple key to participating in the world of AI. It requires nothing but an open mind.

The farthest I've gotten so far has been level 69, almost immediately after returning from Far Harbor. 

After maybe a dozen Permadeath attempts and nearly a decade of regular play on Survival, I have come to the conclusion that complacency and hubris are the deadliest weapons of all. The vast majority of my deaths have been due, not to overwhelming enemy resistance, but to personal agency that manifested as some combination of: being out of position, leaving myself vulnerable, or self-inflicting a blunder.

I'd like to share some examples from my own games, of what I find to be the deadliest threats in Fallout 4:
- **Falling:** recently in Lexington, I was trying to avoid a mob of Ghouls that were running up the scaffolding to the roof near the Raider in PA. Being pinned between the Ghouls and the Raider, I tried to jump onto the scaffolding to then sprint down and avoid them, but I missed the railing and fell three stories to my death. There are also countless times where I fell from a freeway overpass by accident, simply by walking over a hole. I have since learned to be extra vigilant about my footing when exploring urban Boston. 
- **Crashing Vertibirds:** once I got tunnel vision trying to snipe some Super Mutants near South Boston, and didn't realize that there was a BoS Vertibird spiraling down upon me. What a menace. I've since learned to keep a vigilant eye on them, and to keep my distance while the BoS are engaging enemies in the area. 
- **Explosive Weapons:** before I attempted any Permadeath runs, I had looted an Explosive Combat Shotgun and thought I'd give it a shot. I decided to hang it on the wall after it killed me three times in a row: a fence post while fighting Mirelurks, a small mound at my feet while fighting Raiders, and a Mutant Hound that was charging at me but not quite within point-blank range. I still use Explosive Automatics like the Spray 'n Pray and Kiloton, or if I find a Combat Rifle or Handmade Rifle, but I use them with great caution, always on swap (never primary), and only in the open against tight groups of opponents. 
- **Being Overburdened:** my most recent death, which closed out my record level 69 run, still stings. I had just returned from Far Harbor with my kit fully assembled, and I was clearing the area around Coastal Cottage for some XP. After eliminating the Raiders outside Dunwich Borers, I mosied over to the Enclave Camp under the nearby freeway overpass and looted the now dead soldier in Hellfire PA, which left me Overburdened. Now, I have a personal rule that I never travel or fight while encumbered, but I figured that I could safely get back to Coastal Cottage real slow and drop it off. But then, in defiance of my rule, I got distracted by a fight over at Saugus Ironworks and let out a few long-range bursts from my Spray 'n Pray. The next thing I heard was that dreadful whistle getting louder and louder; the Gunner Commander overlooking Hub City Autoworks had locked onto me. I should've dumped the PA then and there and sprinted away with my +40% movement speed, I possibly could've avoided it, but I panicked and let myself die in nuclear annihilation. Suffice to say, I'm never making that mistake again. 
- **Assaultron Head Lasers:** I'm typically stealthy enough that I can get the jump on Assaultrons and kill them before they charge up their laser. But one time near the Nahant Police Station, a BoS party had moved south and started engaging the Sargeant Gutsy at the military supply dump near the causeway. I moved in to engage at the front of the pack, and immediately got vaporized by the invisible Assaultron that had plenty of time to charge up. Another time I was near the Boston Public Library and came across a pack of Red Devils that were massacring a group of Scavengers in a nearby street. I took out the Red Devils, then turned the corner to come face to face with an Assaultron Gorgon with its laser already charged. I should've dipped out and regained the initiative, but instead I panicked and tried to blast it down with my Overseer's Guardian. It turned to look at me, paused for a moment, unleashed the power of the sun right into my face, and that was it. I now have a new rule: stay away from the Assaultrons when they're angry!
- **Parked Cars:** the last time I died to one of these, I got pinned between the front fender and the wall of a Red Rocket near Quincy. Totally avoidable, I should've just gone around, but they *will* sneak up on you when you're least expecting. I haven't died from bumping into one while sprinting in many years, but yes I had a few hard lessons before it sunk in. I neglectfully jumped onto one recently from a one-story roof and was surprised but grateful when it didn't kill me outright. 
- **Mini-nukes... Shot at Someone Else:** again, I'm typically stealthy enough to successfully ambush anyone wielding a Fat Man before they can get a shot off, and I've largely learned their locations so as to anticipate them and keep my distance. But there was this one time in Lexington when I was hiding out in the alleyway near the central plaza, and the Raider up on the bridge had fired into the group of Ghouls. I was all the way back in the alley, looking through the blasted out coffee shop into the plaza, thinking I was far enough away to avoid the blast. Lo and behold, I was not. Lesson learned: when you hear the whistle, *RUN!*
- **The Mechanist's Lair:** that final fight is a doozy.  Each time I died there, it was always due to some explosion, whether from self-destructing robots, or splash from my Explosive weapon, or falling fuel tanks. I should really consider wearing PA, or burning through all my saved up Stealth Boys, for missions like these.
- **Super Mutant Warlords:** I haven't confirmed this, but I believe that these guys have the highest armor rating and HP in the game, especially once you climb into the level 100+ range. The worst part, is that at that level, when a settlement gets attacked by Super Mutants, often every one will spawn as a Warlord and wreck your day with max rank Assault Rifles and Miniguns and Tracking Missile Launchers. It feels like the game is *trying really hard* to kill you. 

For reference, I start with the following SPECIAL stats:
- STR 1
- PER 7
- END 1
- CHA 3
- INT 10
- AGI 5
- LCK 1

When I would consider the build 'complete':
- STR 7
- PER 11

When I met her, she already had a boyfriend who, according to her, didn’t care about her and only used her for sex.  
I was that “I can fix her” type of guy — you know, the one who thinks he can treat her right and show her what love really is.

I’m currently studying to get a better job, and she works in HR.

We actually met at a consulting company — she was the HR there, and I had just joined. At that time, she still had that boyfriend, but there was also this other guy at her office who seemed *a little too involved*.  
She told me that he used to buy her gifts and take her out for coffee a few times. She insisted she wasn’t attracted to him, that he was just being persistent and she didn’t want to be rude.

A few months after we started dating, she confessed that she and that guy used to kiss on the cheeks and hug often.  
When I asked her why she never told me this before, she said it’s because she thought I’d judge her and that she was “a little” attracted to him since her boyfriend at that time didn’t give her attention.  
So basically, she admitted she flirted for attention.  
That was the **first incident** — and it created a small crack in my trust.

Now, fast forward to a few months ago — she was working at a different company.  
Her boss (who’s married and has a kid) was kind of flirting with her, though she claimed she didn’t notice. When I checked their team chats, she was also being a little flirty with him, letting him do her part of the work, and accepting chocolates from him during her periods.  
He even used to drop her home sometimes after work.

I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that, and after a small argument, she said she’d tell him not to drop her anymore.  
But one day, I went to surprise her at work… and saw him dropping her off again.  
When I confronted her, she said she “forgot” that I had told her not to let that happen.  
That was the **second incident**.

Now, this one isn’t a big deal but it still says something: in our entire relationship, she’s only bought me one gift. I’ve given her plenty, even though she earns and I’m still studying.

Then I started learning more about her past — and honestly, it was hard to digest.  
She’s had a pattern of starting flings at work, saying it excites her to keep things secret.  
She lies often to get out of tough situations.  
She’s had physical relationships with a few of her childhood male friends — sex with two, made out with one, and still keeps in touch with another as “just a friend.”  
so, I figure she has no boundaries and once she told me when we were working at the same workplace that after being friend with someone for few weeks having fun talking laughing  
she always matching the vibes she felt attracted to that person that her natural yah she told me that  
She even used to send Snap streaks in her bra, showing cleavage, just to get attention.  
She doesn’t have any female friends now.

And to be honest, even our sex life isn’t great. Once she's done, she just lies there — no effort, no affection, nothing.

Then comes the **third incident**.  
She recently got a remote job, and there’s this new guy who’s clearly flirting with her — asking for her Insta, sending Snap requests, etc.  
I later found out that during her free time, instead of calling me, she calls *him*.

Now I’ve also found out she’s into some kind of virtual exhibitionism — like showing her body online (without showing her face).  
I’m really not okay with that.

Recently, she even said she’s okay with a threesome — specifically, two girls and one guy.  
I guess it's just to push so in future I can do same for her by letting her do threesome with me and some dude and her  
I told her straight up that’s never going to happen.

Despite all this, she says she loves me, wants to go for couple’s therapy, and imagines a future with me — kids, marriage, everything.  
But something feels off.

I feel like she doesn’t actually love me for who I am — she just sees me as the “good guy” who’ll always accept her no matter what.  
She calls me smart, responsible, and kind… but it feels like I’m more of a future investment to her, not a real partner she’s emotionally loyal to.

Also, the whole threesome thing? I think of this quite often her ex (the guy she really into but he doesn't give a fuck about her) she never would've asked him for a threesome  
knowing how jealous type she is, it’s weird she’s suddenly okay with “two girls and one guy.”

Anyway, that’s the gist of it.  
There’s more to the story, but I think this gives a pretty clear picture.

There is a low table to my right, and another armchair on the other side. This chair is also facing into the coffee shop. The table is positioned to be shared. My coffee is very much on my side of the table, right on the edge.

  
I came back from the bathroom, and someone has taken the armchair on the right. No problem of course. I stood for a moment to the side as they were taking photos of their coffee and slice of cake and I didn't want to be in the shot. They acknowledged and thanked me for waiting.

  
All good so far, but this is what has annoyed me, and I wonder am I overreacting...

  
I sat down when they were done, and a few seconds later they picked up my coffee mug, not by the handle, but by putting their fingers near the rim of the mug. To be clear, not from on top like a claw machine, from the side, but close to the top, and put my mug next to their plate and coffee cup to take more photos. 

I just watched, somewhat shocked, they looked at me, thanked me and said they liked the funny statement written on my mug, and returned the mug to its original position.

Feel free to use my spreadsheet. I’ll be updating it with new strategies and new websites whenever I find ones that work. I’ll explain below the exact strategy I use to maximize profit.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRN4CcSmhWzRHIMuz75cKpH76ywP8aG5EdFIDPaAF\_2oDg85HnrlssN3VOmyNa4mMfQH1JdzWtvcy5\_/pubhtml](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRN4CcSmhWzRHIMuz75cKpH76ywP8aG5EdFIDPaAF_2oDg85HnrlssN3VOmyNa4mMfQH1JdzWtvcy5_/pubhtml)

**Step 1:** I log into every casino from my spreadsheet each morning while having my coffee, and the first thing I do is check for any sale or deal. These are usually offers like “Get 50 SC coins for $16.99.” When I find one, I buy the deal and take the 50 SC coins, which must be played at least once before they can be redeemed. I then use those SC coins on high “return to player” (RTP) games, usually table games like roulette, where I have a good chance of breaking even while meeting the play-through requirement. I usually just buy every deal I like throughout a week or two to stack as many SC coins as I can. Then I’ll spend one evening every now and then playing through and washing all the coins I bought throughout the week.  
I aim to cash out with a 95% RTP, so if I buy 100 SC, I aim to cash out with $95, which I achieve basically every time. (I’ll add specific game strategies at the bottom.)

**Important:** Make sure to buy the sign-up bonus deals. These deals are usually 100%–300% more SC than you spend. 300% deals are somewhat rare, so make sure to buy these ones so you don’t have to wait a few weeks for the next very high offer. This is something I didn’t do when I first started because I was skeptical and thought there was some catch where the website wouldn’t let me cash out. But once I realized that cashing out is easy and works, I started buying all future sign-up bonuses.

**Step 2:** Next, I collect my daily rewards. Most of these sweepstakes websites offer a reward for consistently logging in every day. You’ll get a daily bonus of $0.50–$1 as long as you keep logging in. $0.50–$1 isn’t very much, but when you have a list of 30 websites, each daily bonus adds up over time.  
**Tip:** Some websites have progressive systems where day one you get $0.20, day two $0.40, and by day seven you get $2. It ensures you log in every day and averages out to $0.50–$1 per day.

**Step 3:** The third thing I do is grind the VIP programs to increase my daily bonus. You’ll also get some free SC coins every time you level up in a VIP program. What I’ll do is, if I’m working remotely for the day, I’ll open a few of these websites and find the highest RTP slot on each one. Then I’ll do auto spins with gold coins. I usually spin less than 1% of the total gold coins amount and just let it run all day. On some of these websites, it can take a while to upgrade your VIP, but it only takes a couple of minutes to set up, and I just minimize the tab and let it run in the background.

**Step 4:** Cashing out. I was skeptical when I started and thought this wouldn’t work, but I was surprised when I easily cashed out all my winnings. Most of these have a minimum amount you can redeem, usually $50, so you can’t cash out your daily bonus every day. You’ll get larger sums of money randomly throughout the month instead. Some websites offer gift cards that you can redeem, and these minimums are usually around $10–$20. Personally, I’ve never redeemed a gift card because I just want the cash so I can use it to pay my monthly expenses. Cashing out usually takes 12 to 72 hours, so don’t worry when it’s not immediately in your bank account like I did the first time.

This is not a get-rich-quick plan or necessarily scalable, but getting a couple of grand a month by spending 15 minutes a day logging in, collecting bonuses, and buying sales is something I’ll take any day.

**Strategies I use:**

**Roulette:** I bet 1 SC coin on all 37 numbers. Sure, I’ll lose 1 SC coin per spin, but when I’m buying deals and collecting my free bonuses, I’m still cashing out 95%+ of the original SC coins I had. This one is fast because you can wash over 100 coins in just a few spins.

**Slots:** Not my favorite because you can have long losing streaks, but I still cash out with a good profit about 95% of the time using slots. I look up the highest RTP slots online and then check the websites to see which of those slots they have. Some websites only offer slots, so you need to use this strategy sometimes, but I generally stay away from it if I can.

**Originals (My go To):** I’m not sure what to call these, but these are games like Mines or Dice. I set up auto-spin on these games, and for Mines, I’ll choose one mine and only pick one square. The same logic applies to Dice: I set the win percentage as high as possible (96%+) and turn auto-spin on. This is my go-to method because you can bet 1 SC and win 1.04 SC, and it still counts toward washing the whole SC you bet.

**Live Table Games:** I prefer Baccarat, but Blackjack works well too. These games have a slightly under 50% chance of winning a hand (around 49.5%), but if you play enough hands, you’ll wash all your SC coins and only lose a few depending on how many you’re playing.

**Disclaimers:**

 You can lose money doing this. The strategy I use minimizes this risk, and personally, I’ve made at least a few hundred dollars profit every month I’ve done this, but you can go on long losing streaks trying to wash your SC coins. I wouldn’t necessarily say this is free money with no risk. Just be careful, stick to your plan, and don’t randomly gamble your SC coins, and it’ll increase your chances of being profitable.

I have also been doing this for Over 8 months, and my VIP daily bonuses will be higher than yours for now so the rewards on the sheet may be higher than what you see right now for some websites",0,1762237273.0,thesidehustle,1,0.5,False
1oo05i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipproblems/comments/1oo05i8/26m_dating_25f_should_i_breakup_need_advice/,26M Dating 25F should i breakup need advice,"So I started dating this girl about a year back.  
When I met her, she already had a boyfriend who, according to her, didn’t care about her and only used her for sex.  
I was that “I can fix her” type of guy — you know, the one who thinks he can treat her right and show her what love really is.

I’m currently studying to get a better job, and she works in HR.

We actually met at a consulting company — she was the HR there, and I had just joined. At that time, she still had that boyfriend, but there was also this other guy at her office who seemed *a little too involved*.  
She told me that he used to buy her gifts and take her out for coffee a few times. She insisted she wasn’t attracted to him, that he was just being persistent and she didn’t want to be rude.

A few months after we started dating, she confessed that she and that guy used to kiss on the cheeks and hug often.  
When I asked her why she never told me this before, she said it’s because she thought I’d judge her and that she was “a little” attracted to him since her boyfriend at that time didn’t give her attention.  
So basically, she admitted she flirted for attention.  
That was the **first incident** — and it created a small crack in my trust.

Now, fast forward to a few months ago — she was working at a different company.  
Her boss (who’s married and has a kid) was kind of flirting with her, though she claimed she didn’t notice. When I checked their team chats, she was also being a little flirty with him, letting him do her part of the work, and accepting chocolates from him during her periods.  
He even used to drop her home sometimes after work.

I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that, and after a small argument, she said she’d tell him not to drop her anymore.  
But one day, I went to surprise her at work… and saw him dropping her off again.  
When I confronted her, she said she “forgot” that I had told her not to let that happen.  
That was the **second incident**.

Now, this one isn’t a big deal but it still says something: in our entire relationship, she’s only bought me one gift. I’ve given her plenty, even though she earns and I’m still studying.

Then I started learning more about her past — and honestly, it was hard to digest.  
She’s had a pattern of starting flings at work, saying it excites her to keep things secret.  
She lies often to get out of tough situations.  
She’s had physical relationships with a few of her childhood male friends — sex with two, made out with one, and still keeps in touch with another as “just a friend.”  
so, I figure she has no boundaries and once she told me when we were working at the same workplace that after being friend with someone for few weeks having fun talking laughing  
she always matching the vibes she felt attracted to that person that her natural yah she told me that  
She even used to send Snap streaks in her bra, showing cleavage, just to get attention.  
She doesn’t have any female friends now.

And to be honest, even our sex life isn’t great. Once she's done, she just lies there — no effort, no affection, nothing.

Then comes the **third incident**.  
She recently got a remote job, and there’s this new guy who’s clearly flirting with her — asking for her Insta, sending Snap requests, etc.  
I later found out that during her free time, instead of calling me, she calls *him*.

Now I’ve also found out she’s into some kind of virtual exhibitionism — like showing her body online (without showing her face).  
I’m really not okay with that.

Recently, she even said she’s okay with a threesome — specifically, two girls and one guy.  
I guess it's just to push so in future I can do same for her by letting her do threesome with me and some dude and her  
I told her straight up that’s never going to happen.

Despite all this, she says she loves me, wants to go for couple’s therapy, and imagines a future with me — kids, marriage, everything.  
But something feels off.

I feel like she doesn’t actually love me for who I am — she just sees me as the “good guy” who’ll always accept her no matter what.  
She calls me smart, responsible, and kind… but it feels like I’m more of a future investment to her, not a real partner she’s emotionally loyal to.

Also, the whole threesome thing? I think of this quite often her ex (the guy she really into but he doesn't give a fuck about her) she never would've asked him for a threesome  
knowing how jealous type she is, it’s weird she’s suddenly okay with “two girls and one guy.”

Anyway, that’s the gist of it.  
There’s more to the story, but I think this gives a pretty clear picture.

What do you guys think?

I’m here because I still believe in something genuine, two people who meet halfway, stay curious, and make space for something real.

I’m 35, from Romania, and work in digital strategy and legal content, a mix of creativity and precision that keeps my mind busy and my coffee intake questionable. When I’m not working, I write fiction, get lost in psychology, mythology, and the strange ways people connect. I invest deeply in friendships and family, but I also guard my time alone, going on long solo walks with music up loud, clearing my head and recharging.

I love deep conversations that drift between laughter and meaning, quiet nights with good music, and moments that feel unfiltered and alive. I value curiosity, integrity, and people who communicate with intention.

Physically, I'm considered conventionally attractive: 

I’m 5'5"", pale-skinned, with dark brown almond eyes, pastel pink hair, a curvy pear-shaped build, full lips, and an expressive face that rarely hides what I feel. I’m drawn to tall white men with strong arms, warmth, confidence, and that grounded, optimistic energy, the kind of person who moves through life with purpose and presence. 

I’m separated and to be divorced so I’m emotionally available and open to connection. I’m not interested in men who are already in relationships, or in heavy drinkers, pot, or drugs. I prefer clarity, not chaos.

I’m especially drawn to men who are driven and passionate, professionally successful, and alive with hobbies and goals that make them feel electric. Someone who communicates openly, enjoys affection, and isn’t afraid to show it. I want someone who matches my energy, my depth, and my curiosity about life. 

I’m not necessarily looking to jump into a relationship straight away, but I’m open to it if it grows naturally. When it comes to children, I’m leaning toward not having them. If kids are something you absolutely want, we’re probably not a fit.

1oo04vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrohnsDisease/comments/1oo04vn/feeling_lost_with_diagnosis_process/,Feeling lost with diagnosis process,"Hey guys!


I am feeling super lost regarding my crohn’s diagnosis and would like some advice from people who have been on this journey for a while.

I am 31, F. I started to have normal / soft stools mixed with diarrhea since march. I also started to have this dull mild stomach ache 24/7 with bloating. Nothing else. I was going through some super stressful stuff at that time, chugging 6-7 coffees a day for a few months so i assumed its that.

I went to get checked, abdominal ultrasound, bloodwork, MRI, stool & pee tests, gyno samples all came perfectly clear.  I got tested for lactose intolerance, turns out I am BADLY intolerant. I got a colonoscopy / endoscopy with multiple biopsies. They found mild gastritis with thinner stomach lining and aphthous ulcers in the last 10 cm of terminal ileum. Biopsies all came back inconclusive as I didn’t reach any markers for crohns. I was put on 9 mg budenofalk and 3 mg salcrozine.

To be honest I feel a lot worse. I have constant migraines, cystic acne all over my body and I started to have bloody vaginal spotting (sorry if TMI). The stomach ache is worse but stools are normal. When I mentioned these to my doctor he said it’s not possible and he changes my suspected crohn diagnosis to moderate crohns. He is pushing for capsule endoscopy and for me to start biologics.

I am not in denial with crohn but I feel very depressed considering I did everything that was asked of me but I just feel gradually worse. I don’t understand why my diagnosis changed suddenly after repeated tests also all came back clear. I know I need the capsule test but my MRI was a week ago and I can’t bring myself to do another colon prep already. When I brought up my new symptoms again & that gyno suspects they are from meds the Gastro doctor only gave me meds for stomach acid and insists I must have chest pains. I never in my life had any, not even now…

Did anyone have a similar journey? Should I look for a second opinion? Honestly I am really scared. The doctor insists crohn can be cured but here I read it’s a lifelong thing that needs constant medication. If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it.",1,1762237171.0,CrohnsDisease,5,1.0,False
