Pros: he‚Äôs a great texter and checks in with me every day from morning till night which I love, calls and likes to receive my calls, follows very few women on Instagram and doesn‚Äôt actively follow any new people since I‚Äôve known him, isn‚Äôt tilting his phone away and seems comfortable to open it around me, is excited to spend time with me and overall he‚Äôs playful and funny. He listens to me if something bothers me and adjusts his behaviour (for example once I was the last one to say good night and he didn‚Äôt open it since there was no point to reply, and I got upset and since then he always makes sure to open). If I need him for anything he always comes through. 


Cons: when we just started going out I found out he was still in touch with his ex and even stopped talking to him for some days until we talked it out and made up. I haven‚Äôt seen any texts or calls from her since then but haven‚Äôt asked him about it either. Most of our conversations are surface level banter or saying how much we miss each other. He doesn‚Äôt ask me ‚Äúdeep‚Äù questions or try to get to know me, although likes to listen to me talk and always asks ‚Äútell me more‚Äù. We don‚Äôt have any shared interests and due to the nature of his job and being on call almost 24/7 we can only afford spontaneous hang outs and those consist of us going for a night car ride (we both work late and we work at the same place, and live next to each other). We haven‚Äôt really been intimate yet except for going down on each other once. Sometimes we go for a party or beach which is nice. Last time at a party he crossed a line by spinning a girl who came with us around in front of me and later brushing up against her knee ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù in the car (he was sitting between us), which was other deliberately trying to make me jealous or not but my trust got broken. And now I hear from my female colleague he always says some random shit to her when passing by which also annoyed me. He also doesn‚Äôt talk about the future. And I feel like sometimes he can be a bit stingy with me like going for the smallest size of coffee without asking me which size I wanted when he is buying. 

I feel like I need a deeper emotional connection and I want to make sure he‚Äôs serious about me. I can‚Äôt stop feeling confused. Is he serious or is he just not sure what he wants?",1,1755997249.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1myi9rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/enlightenment/comments/1myi9rw/a_conversation_with_my_higher_self_i_think/,A conversation with my higher self (I think),"Long time lurker in several of these sub accounts as I have been on an awakening journey for years now. I created my account a little while ago to access content that was age restricted for some reason but now feel compelled to post. I think I just had a conversation with my higher self. Bare with me, I tried to have ChatGPT fix up my ramblings here but it stripped out the context and did not carry the same message in the end (though it helped with the TDLR). This happened yesterday and I waited to have a clear head to see if maybe it was a hallucination or that I would wake up and think that it was all nonsense. I am now fully awake with a few cups of coffee in me. So here it goes. This is a really long post so I have added some notes where you can skip the scenic route.

**TDLR: They had a profound spiritual experience with their higher self and realized that life‚Äôs purpose is to remember that love is the only answer. Pain exists as a teacher, but it can be transformed through love.**

I am writing this down as fast as I can so that I do not forget it. I have had I think small inklings of these connections in the past, but they were brief, not nearly as sharp, and I was not in a state of mind or readiness I think to process the message adequately, and probably still am not to be honest, but I am trying my best.

So, I have been ‚Äòcalling‚Äô to my higher self now for a while now, off and on I would say for a year intentionally but truly I think with a clearer heart and intention this last month. I have been on what anyone would call a death walk due to what I thought was a terminal diagnosis for about six months prior to this only to find out I am 100% healthy very recently (side note: I am purposefully leaving out the details about my personal life throughout because none of it is germane to this happening and frankly the details would deter from the message I receive).

**SCENIC ROUTE BEGINS, SCROLL DOWN TO TAKE THE EXPRESS ROUTE**

During my death walk I would say I really tuned in to my practices from an authentic space. I am middle aged, of course understood we are all going to ‚Äòdie‚Äô eventually, I just never felt it would be this ‚Äòsoon‚Äô. Anyhow, it was at this time I decided it was now or never to live my authentic life and be damned what anyone would think. I stopped fighting with my spouse, who with which truly we were on the brink of collapse. I quit my job. I threw myself into my heart pursuits that I had feared stepping fully into for fear of ‚Äòwhat would everyone think?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if I fail?‚Äù ‚Äúwho will take me seriously?‚Äù

What had once seemed to matter deeply and had served to guide my life till now no longer mattered. I was going to die. I don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt want to follow the rules anymore. I was not angry, I was not worried, I was not even scared. I turned inward. Completely. I became a hermit. But not in a negative way. I was at peace. I found comfort in the silence. I would say that I have felt alone all my life, even with another presence in my home with me always. I had many friends. I had great professional contacts and acquaintances. I was fairly comfortable in my career- by no means rich but comfortable enough and I was fairly good at my job but the last few years has been a bit of a strain, with myself asking if this was all there was.

But I never quite ever dialed fully into it, I always felt like an outsider, even with my most intimate of relationships there seemed to always be a performative piece of me. And so really early on, I learned to observe, at first I guess to try to make sense of everything because a lot did not make sense to me. I read a lot. I was into esoterica at a really really young age, and I would say I had/have a bit of a ‚Äòknowing‚Äô that freaks a lot of people out if I let it slip out too much. Anyway, I became really good at starting to understand people. I understood their feelings. I really felt connected to them and when I was in the presence of people regularly that connection only deepened. I felt extreme empathy really young. But this empathy and my inability to really ‚Äòfit in‚Äô seemed to push me into imbalanced relationships and lack of boundaries. My searching for spiritual meaning got muddled with my desire to be acknowledged. I lost my way in my 30s and 40s, wrapped up in career, kids, marriage. I climbed the ladder if you will, went to school, attained degrees and some professional recognition. I followed the ‚Äòrules‚Äô but this only seemed to widen the gap between me and everyone else. If I excelled, it only seemed to make others angry and resentful.

But¬†**now**¬†my boundaries became firm. There was no question mark at the end of my statements. I was still kind. But I was also firm. I still moved in empathy, but I also finally extended that to¬†**myself**. I had heard the term love yourself before and I honestly thought I had. But I realized that I had not. I can tell you I felt like I went through my life review. I looked at all the dark places in my life and examined them with clear eyes. I atoned. I learned to forgive myself and see the effects along the way that led to my wiring at each moment. Make no mistake, I am not moving blame for any of my misdeeds on to others. But I also understood the processes at play that led to my actions and thoughts. And this was a pivotal turning point in my mindset leading to now. Tonight.

**SCENIC ROUTE ENDS**

Full disclosure, I do partake in medical cannabis for medical purposes. I do not deny there has been added benefit to facilitating my own enlightenment path. That started about 7 years ago when I went through what I thought was my first dark night of the soul (I realize now I had several before that I had not recognized at the time). 7 years ago, though, I truly feel I met God. I was in the worst place of my life (I feel silly now about it and how I felt about it because truly now if feels so trivial, but I digress). It happened when I was meditating- I was very deep in the Monroe tapes- but did not get past Wave 1. This experience shook me to my core. I felt it through my body. I was electric. I called to my husband when I ‚Äòcame back‚Äô and spoke to him about it, it was truly life changing. Just not life changing enough I guess, lol, as Source decided I needed to feel a sense of urgency or at least understand to some degree that I needed to ‚Äòwake up‚Äô from consensual reality.

So I was outside in my backyard. We have had several days of rain and today was the first sunny day in many. This evening as I partook in my evening dose I watched the sunset, a truly spectacular one. And I thought to myself, I have not grounded in a little while, let me get my feet into the grass and soil. And I did and normally it is quite prickly and a bit uncomfortable but not tonight. It was lovely and soft. And I just stood, finished my dose, and enjoyed the sun setting into a beautiful pink purple and gold night. I have this lovely deep purple vine that grows along my fence that was standing in contrast to the sky and it was all so lovely.

I was so happy and so grateful and I just stood and listened to all the birds, and I just LISTENED, and I could hear all the chatter and I could tell they were talking to each other. And I just thought to myself wow, it is so lovely that they are talking to each other, and I could hear them go on for miles away. And I thought, I don‚Äôt hear any human voices, I mean I live in a fairly dense suburban area with houses all around me. I could hear other animals now, some skittering in the grass near the greenway that borders my own yard. And I looked at the trees and I thought to myself even the trees are talking to each other right now, we don‚Äôt see it or hear it but they are. And I thought to myself how much utter LIFE was around me, life of all kinds, even insects who are largely unseen even though they out populate us by quintillions, each experiencing the world from a different vantage point.

And then I felt a bit sad because I realized how much of my life I have wrapped up in things and worries that effectively are meaningless- that I have taken my life far too seriously and missed the bigger picture, if you will. That somehow, we got trapped in this mess we have created and do not know how to undo. Suddenly my right ear went deaf like an air bubble in my ear and then a faint hum came into my body. I just closed my eyes and went inside my mind. I had been doing so when listening to the birds and all around me and then I did it again and just found myself deep in my mind castle. But I was fully awake and receiving, normally when I meditate I almost go into a sleep state but not this time.

Here is where the connections are murky for me, but essentially I believe my higher self told me that is why I am here. To experience this world and to come to understand that love is truly the only answer. That these bodies are avatars, if you will. They are kind of machines, but that is actually disrespectful in a way, as they are really a sacred vessel, truly, that allows us to navigate the world and experience it, to ultimately learn that love is the only answer. That is why it is programmed with pain and also why we ‚Äòforget‚Äô to a degree. If we came in here already knowing what we know, we would not learn it. How‚Äôs that for a mind trip, eh? Let me try to explain.

We come here to understand emotion and to ultimately learn that love and light are always the one and only answer. But we need to learn it to remember it, and we need to keep remembering it, because we keep forgetting. I hope that makes sense. And we do that by experiencing it.

And here is where it gets even murkier and not fully formed in my mind‚Ä¶we are both programmed to ‚Äòforget‚Äô who we are and we are also programmed to experience pain. We needed pain to both insure our respect for this vessel, thus a built in survival chip, but also to ensure that we stayed here; the experience of pain somehow is tied to our sense of mortality. Pain keeps us out of danger, we avoid pain as much as we can, and so it is a security system if you will. Pain (read also as discomfort) also serves as a teaching tool because it arises when there is a lack of love. But it was somehow not factored in that we may seek out pain or have the ability to inflict pain because in our benevolence we did not understand this reality. I have no idea if that makes sense‚Ä¶ The downside of pain was not anticipated. But it has also propelled the teaching mechanism. Which may in fact be feeding the loop of enlightenment for all. I will stop there because at this point I was coming out of the connection, and I am entering into topics that will likely bring up questions I truly cannot answer.

While in this connection, I recognized the separateness of myself from my body, I felt the two us‚Äô if you will. I did not separate; I was just cognizant of the two and at this time I felt profound gratitude to my body who I have abused far too much and not loved nearly enough. I also have a renewed connection to the world around me and a fearless and boundlessness I had not had before. Truly the only boundaries are our own.

And with that. Goodnight üòä

**Addendum**: I went to bed hoping to find the connection again. I wrote myself this note on my phone before it escaped me in my sleep.

So I was lying in bed trying to match the earlier frequency. I focused on the phrase ‚Äòlove is the only answer‚Äô over and over until I felt a very warm uplifting feeling in my core. It did not take long and it continued to grow the more I focused on the phrase. It was bliss. That is the only way I can describe it. And then I received what I can only describe as a glitched image in my mind and the thought that pain was the glitch. That by creating pain somehow it grew as a virus almost. Again we need to remember that the pain is self-inflicted the only way to eradicate it is to love it until there is no more pain. But by loving it we are not killing or eradicating it, we are transmuting it, alchemizing it. We need to remember to love. That when we wanted to experience something other than ourselves (and by that I mean we are all one, we all came to this decision together at some point), that was the first judgement- the thought of us as anything but perfect, that created pain from that judgement that then created the experience of needing to remember . And so it goes a balance between the two both ever knowing and amnesic at once forever learning to love and live in bliss as we remember.

Sorry if this is a bit incoherent but maybe it will help someone who is going through a similar experience because I have felt alone in this journey and now I feel compelled to share this. Note that I am indeed OK üòä",1,1755997148.0,enlightenment,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Reds vs. Diamondbacks: A Tale of Two Batting Averages (and One Very Confused Run Line)**

The Cincinnati Reds (-128 underdogs) will try to shock the Arizona Diamondbacks (+134 favorites) in a game that‚Äôs already written its own tragic opera. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a scout who‚Äôs seen *everything*.

### The Numbers That Won‚Äôt Lie (But Might Sneeze)

* **Reds**: .248 team average, 4.5 R/G, 23rd in strikeouts (8.6 K/G). Their pitching? A 3.79 ERA (10th best), but Andrew Abbott‚Äôs 8.1 K/9 might make you question his career choices.
* **Diamondbacks**: .251 average, 4.9 R/G (5th in MLB), and Ketel Marte‚Äôs .293 BA is basically a personal insult to the concept of ""average."" Their pitching? A 4.55 ERA (25th worst). Ouch.

### Moneyline Math

Arizona‚Äôs implied probability to win? **53.6%** (thanks to +134 odds). Cincinnati‚Äôs? **44.9%**. That 8.7% gap feels about right‚Äîlike the difference between ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just grab a coffee and a defibrillator.‚Äù

### Spread & Total Shenanigans

* **Spread**: Arizona -2.5 (-110). If you‚Äôre betting on the D-backs, you‚Äôre banking on their offense outscoring the Reds‚Äô collective ‚Äúwait, is that a strikeout?‚Äù routine.
* **Total**: 9.5 runs (Over: 1.91, Under: 1.83). With the Reds‚Äô pitchers (read: Abbott‚Äôs K/9) and Arizona‚Äôs bats, this feels like a 10-run

1myi9hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1myi9hk/met_my_greatest_love_an_ex_for_the_first_time_in/,Met my greatest love (an ex) for the first time in 5 years.,"I met my greatest love, an ex, for the first time in 5 years yesterday. We sat over a cup of coffee to discuss everything that has happened over the last 5 years. 

Our story? We became together on December of 2019 until June 2020. For us, those were the peak of our happiest moments. We loved each other so much. I was his first love, and he was my greatest love. We introduced each other in each other's family. Those were the time that I felt treated like a princess, and I really felt that he loved me genuinely. 

Suddenly, around March, the world was disrupted. Pandemic came. We held on for a few months, but June came, then suddenly, I did not hear anything from him. He messaged me after a week to just say that he didn't want to be with me anymore. 

For the last 5 years, the question lingers. What was that? I thought he loved me? I thought we were at our peak? I didn't bother to know because of anger. I decided to move forward. 

Yesterday, those questions were answered. He told me that he suddenly got scared of commitment. He didn't step up for our relationship. He didn't fight for us. He tried to push me away because he had so many battles. I told him, if he just opened up everything to me, I would face those battles with him. I never would've given up on him. 

He acknowledged the guilt. He said sorry. He said that he should've pursue me after we broke up. He told me that he kept on dreaming about me every night. And that was the case for me too. 

Now, he's already in a relationship for over a year already. He admitted that there's still this gap in his heart as we have an ""unfinished business."" I asked him, if he wasn't in a relationship, would there be a second chance fo us? He said yes. 

Of course, now, I know my place. But in the back of my mind, I know that I never stopped loving him.

‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs move, we gotta go,‚Äù Douggie said.¬†

‚ÄúHow long was I out for?‚Äù I asked,¬†

‚Äú5 days,‚Äù He responded. I looked down at my wrists, seeing a scar that went up through my hand and forearm. We walked back out into the field, staying low and crawling through the field. We made it to the center of the field. With the slab of rock in the center. We heard voices coming from behind us in the distance. We heard the sound of rustling plants and cracking sticks coming closer. We dropped to our stomachs and shuffled to the side. We then heard the footsteps getting closer and faster. A huge, thick hand wrapped around my ankle, pulling me out from the stocks of corn. Lifting me and dropping me and Douggie on the dirt. ‚ÄúYou thought that you could get out of here without me knowing I have eyes everywhere, Marcus, my dear boy,‚Äù The Headmaster said. Douggie ran to his feet and punched him in the mouth. A little trickle of blood slipped out of the corner of his mouth.¬†

‚Äú**YOU DARE STRIKE A GOD YOU FEEBLE INSOLENT CHILD,**‚Äù The Headmaster yelled. He pulled his foot back and kicked in the ribs so hard that I heard them crack. He then lifted him and headbutted him back to the ground. Douggie started to try to crawl away toward the door. The Headmaster strolled along with him before stamping down onto his leg, stopping and leaving him writhing in pain. He then lifted his right arm and placed his foot on the back of his elbow. Kicking hard, snapping his arm so hard I almost bit off a piece of my tongue when I gritted my teeth. His screams sounded through the warehouse-sized underground farm. He dragged Douggie‚Äôs body over to the stone circle. Douggie tried to tear his hand off his scalp with his one good arm. He punched him in the stomach so hard that more blood spluttered up from his mouth. He lay there on the ground, still without moving. He raised his foot high above his face, and before I could get to him, he slammed his foot down on his face three times. ‚Äú**SMACK**‚Äù ‚Äú**CRACK**‚Äù ‚Äú**SQUELCH**‚Äù. All I could muster out was a strained, broken cry of¬†

‚ÄúNO‚Äù. I sobbed loudly and ran to Douggie‚Äôs side.¬†

‚ÄúPlease, God, don‚Äôt die, my god, please don‚Äôt die‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúLook, Marcus stars‚Äù. I looked up at the ceiling to see the small circular skylight with stars shimmering down from it. I watched as Douggie let out one last tear before closing his eyes and passing on. He finally became a spaceman. I ran at the Headmaster. He spun around quickly and punched me in the stomach so hard that when I landed, I saw stars. Just like that, he was dead. Douggie was dead. My best friend's body lay still and motionless, with all the warmth from his body spilling out onto the dirt. I fell back onto my back, staring up at the lamps illuminating this warehouse-like space. I wasn‚Äôt brought back by the sound of the Headmaster shouting. I knew that any moment now I would wake up and see my mom standing over my bed telling me that the past decade was just one long dream and I would hear Rick snoring in the other room and the old A/C rattling in the hot summer night and that my mom would sing me a son from our favorite band and I would fall back to sleep knowing that in a couple of hours that I would wake up and see my mom downstairs in her polka-dot apron making fresh blueberry pancakes and that she would smile at me and I would do the same back to her. She would then let me try a sip of our coffee, even though we both knew that I hated the taste of it. She would then wave goodbye to me as I rode the bus to school. And the world would be at peace again. But I knew it wasn‚Äôt true. No blueberry pancakes were waiting for me, and this was no dream. I heard the Headmaster shout at the orderlies.¬†

‚ÄúGo take the dead one to the press and the other one to the boiler room, and go clean this crap up and get me some new clothes‚Äù. I felt myself hoisted over one of the orderlies‚Äô shoulders. I didn‚Äôt fight, I just let him carry me off. I didn‚Äôt care what happened anymore. I died with Douggie that night. I was set in a metal closet of a room with small, thin pipes and copper and brass walls. The floor was covered with a thick film that looked like some kind of ash or soot. I sat in there for about five minutes before the room began to heat up. It hurt to touch the walls as they singed my fingers and clothes. I began to sweat profusely, and my vision began to blur from the heat. I vomited into the pile of ash from the heat. I was feeling dizzy. Just then, my pants began to get singed at the bottom of my pant legs. I heard the gas start to turn on like the sound a blowtorch makes before it starts blasting flames. I can‚Äôt remember if I passed out at this point or not, but I was standing in a green field with a blue sky and a crystal lake in front of it. It looks like a mirror copy of where I had met with Belial. I started to sob uncontrollably when I saw the figures standing before me. It was Elizabeth and Douggie. They stood before me with caring and empathetic eyes.¬†

‚ÄúWh-wh-where am I?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúThe Elysian Fields‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúIs this heaven?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYes, Marcus, this is heaven‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúAm I dead?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo, not yet, but we are here to give you some words of encouragement so that you may finish what you have yet to complete‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo, wait, I can‚Äôt go back there, he‚Äôs too powerful, he won.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNot yet, Marcus, you have to win, you have to make sure we don't die in vain‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúOne last thing, Marcus, I always said that you were my sidekick. I was always the sidekick, Marcus. You are the Batman to my Robin.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, Douggie, I‚Äôm nothing without you‚Äù.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou're Yourself, Marcus‚Äù. I looked up and saw a white cloud with golden light shooting out from it. Only for a moment did the cloud part, and I saw a face made of every color and sound and emotion. It was indescribable, it was magnificent, it was glorious. I saw him, I saw the face of God. I was launched down through the ground back into the boiler room.¬† I then touched my jacket pocket and felt the note that Douggie had given me. I knew I couldn‚Äôt let that burn; I had to give it to his parents. I had to tell them I was sorry that I couldn‚Äôt keep their son safe. I punched the glass. It was firm, but I had to keep going. I kept slamming my fist into the glass over and over again. My hand was bleeding and battered. I could feel my hand breaking as I kept hitting it until I started to see cracks. Then ‚Äú**CRACK CRACK SHATTER**‚Äù. The glass loudly shattered, leaving a hole that I could reach my arm through. Just barely brushing down on the handle.¬† I grabbed the handle on the latch and pulled it upwards. I burst through the door, slamming the latch back down after me. One of the staff members ran forward and lunged at me. I was able to roll out of the way. Just as he lunged at me, the room that I was in erupted in flames, blasting him in the face and spiraling backwards. Some of the sparks flickered onto a beam of food resting nearby. Clutching one side of his face, as it was seared from the fire. I then grabbed him and pushed him forward into an open plexiglass door.Before he could react, I shut and latched the door as he banged on the door from the other side. I then turned to the side and slammed my fist down on a button on a control console next to the door. The man looked up, all blood draining from his face as a huge metal cylinder descended above him. It had pieces of guts and intestines dripping off of it as it lowered. As I turned and ran away, I heard him pleading and begging before another huge ‚Äú**SQUELCH**‚Äù. I looked over and saw a huge chute with a couple of shovels next to it. Wherever that chute led was better than here. I dropped down into the chute, and it sloped and turned several times. It felt like the chute was caked in a layer of mud, which covered me. When I got to the bottom, there was a small amount of light trickling in from a crack in the ceiling. It barely illuminated 3 feet in front of me. I saw bones and pieces of rotting flesh. The scent of it made me vomit onto the ground, then stumble into my vomit. I then looked at myself and realized that the mud from the chute was rotting flesh. I had no time to dwell on it. I had to get through this. I placed my hand on the left wall and walked forward. As I had heard, if you put your hand on the left wall of a maze and follow it, you can get out in the fastest way possible. The Headmaster tackled me into the side of the wall. He was on top of me. I could feel him squeezing the life from my body. I picked up a heavy nearby rock and bashed it into his face. He tumbled off me and fell to the ground. He was bleeding from the side of his face and was fuming with anger. I kicked him in the side, and on the second kick, he caught my foot and pulled me to the floor. He grabbed my head and slammed it into the wooden support beams. I spun around and sucker punched him in the jaw. He pulled out a knife and jabbed it into my side. I could feel my liver burn as the steel was plunged into it. He twisted the knife like a screwdriver and pulled the knife out from my side. Blood gushed from the wound as I tried to stop the bleeding. I kicked him in the stomach, which felt like fire on my side. He fell to the ground, and I jumped up on top of him and grabbed another rock and raised it high above my head and brought it down over and over again so many times that I thought that the rock might split. I looked down at the man who had haunted my nightmares for the past twelve years. His head is now a caved-in disk. I stood up, spat some blood from my mouth onto him, and continued to walk. I could hear roaring fire all around me, but I just kept on moving. I could barely walk and needed some water and a shower. I didn‚Äôt know how long I was down there. I didn't know if I was down there for 6 hours or 6 days. All I know is that I eventually came to a stairway. I walked up the stairs and found a door. I slammed myself into the door, and it opened up into the front garden, the same front garden I had spent so many years sitting out with Douggie in this grass. I walked out to the front area, the little cobblestone walkway leading up to the front doors. I stood in the same spot where Ms.Kathy had jumped off the roof. The front gates in front of me were wide open. I walked forward, standing in front of the gates. Wondering if I would get shot or something, or erupt in flames, but instead, I just passed through the gates. Freel,y nothing happened, and when I crossed the street, I looked back at the St. Ovadis home for wayward children. I saw him there, standing in the window, smoking a cigar was the Headmaster.The school all around him was a blazing inferno. I could hear the screams of the orderlies as they got their final judgments. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be able to save the others in there, but I prayed they could find their way out. He just watched me with his blank demonic face illuminated by the cigar. He just turned and walked back into the red and burning death. I just looked back at the school that had been my prison for the last decade. I cried knowing that I was finally free. I thought back to all those days ago to what Douggie had said. ‚Äú The closest town is only 5 miles away‚Äù. I started walking in the direction of the town I could see on the map with the list of home locations. I got pretty far before seeing a small patch of trees next to a small stream, which I realized I hadn‚Äôt eaten or drunk anything in a week. I knelt and drank furiously and then saw a patch of berries next to the stream. I couldn't believe it. They were raspberries. I turned my head to the night sky and yelled,¬†

‚ÄúThank God‚Äù.¬† I grabbed fistfuls of them and swallowed them in one bite. I looked down at my face and realized I looked awful. I had bruises all over my face and arms, my hair was matted and greasy, and I also had a slight five o‚Äôclock shadow. I had never realized, up until this point, really just how much I did look like my mother. I¬† waded into the river and washed the rotting flesh off my body, then left my clothes on the riverbank. I then sat with my back resting on a tree nearby and slept there for the rest of the night. The next morning, I continued to walk down the road. Seeing a sign saying ‚ÄúTown Line Entering Zion, Maryland‚Äù. I saw a small family home on one side of the road and realized even after my river bath, I still smelled horrible and probably looked even worse, and what's the worst that could happen, prison? I walked around the side of the house and realized I hadn‚Äôt been in a real home in ten years. I jumped and climbed over the wooden fence and realized I was getting good at climbing and running. I kicked open the weak sliding screen door and stepped inside. I saw a calendar and realized the year was 1993. I tore open the fridge and riffled through it searching for some form of food, and settled on leftover chicken. It was the best meal I've had in my life. I then moved on to the bedrooms, searching the bedrooms for some clothes that would fit me. I then ended up choosing an old leather jacket, a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, a pair of jeans, and work boots. I grabbed some snacks and a bottle of water and walked out the front door. I kept walking past the town and then came to a small clearing in a forest overlooking a small lake. I picked up a sharp rock, took two flat pieces of wood, and fashioned a couple of makeshift graves. One for Douggie and one for Elizabeth. I then realized that I still hadn‚Äôt read his note out of respect for him. I wondered if he read mine.¬†

Dear mom, dad, and andy

	Mom, I always loved you, and you always loved me. I know we never show it to each other, but I know you always had my best interests at heart. But I want you to promise me something, promise me you‚Äôll go clean and that you‚Äôll stop using your pills.¬†

Dad, I know you weren‚Äôt really in my life that much, but I know you would have made a great dad. Promise me that you‚Äôll be a good dad to Andy.¬†

Andy, stay away from my comic books, or I'll come back and haunt you. But you always were a good step-brother, and as much as I pretended to hate you, I always loved you.¬†

With love¬†

Dylan ‚ÄúDouggie‚Äù Parker Jr.

I felt tears fall onto the page. I blinked and bit my lower lip to stop myself from sobbing and put the note back into my pocket. I then looked out at the view, and it was beautiful. The sky was clear blue, and not a cloud in sight. Douggie always did like blue skies. I wish he were here with me. He was a good friend, the best one I ever had. I wish I had the chance to tell him that. He was the best thing that ever happened to me.

I read an interesting thread in r/Coffee that explains why pretty well. However everything I've read about grinding  beans says that you need to adjust grind settings for different roast levels - a darker roast needs a coarser grind. If this is true, where do I start when the roaster doesn't tell me what the level of roast is?",1,1755996981.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

1myi41k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1myi41k/hardest_break_up_for_me/,Hardest Break up for me,"I loved him so much and he loved me so much. He wasnt perfect at all, his biggest red flag was how selfish he could be or avoiding communication because he didn't want to upset me. We only ever had one argument over his reckless driving. It's only been a week. I dont expect to just feel better in such a short amount of time, but the pain is so unbearable. I'm not hungry and I havent been for the past few days. Ill eat the bare minimum, usually at night, and if i dont feel nauseous ill just fall asleep after. Drinking water is the only thing I can keep down without feeling a huge strange sense of guilt, but its still there. The biggest issue was his communication and my emotional permanency.

 I grew up in a terrible abusive home, and being alive today is nothing short of a miracle and being at the wrong place at the right time. But because of that I've spent years in therapy, not sure if it even counts because I was borderline mute. About 3 years ago i started seeing a therapist, i opened up more, but we werent too close. I moved to states and started seeing another therapist. Finally being able to talk about everything was hard at first, but i did it. Unfortunately, it was made very clear that I suffered from Major Depressive Disorder and terrible Emotional permanency. Ive been trying so hard to grow as a person and even though it hits hard sometimes, i can control my self easier. 


We dated for over a year, almost a year and a half, we went on trips, dates, friends trips, got eachother gifts- but more importantly, i felt like i could be myself and not feel scared. I felt like I had found someone who saw me as a person and not something that needed fixing. He'd comfort me all the time, he wasn't the best at listening, but he was still amazing. I've had relationships in the past where i was treated well and with care, but this was nothing like that. It felt different. Everytime I looked at him i felt like i could see our future. His reaction after a meal I cooked for him made nearly setting the kitchen on fire entirely worth it. I tried so hard to not let my insecurities or trauma or fear get to me. He'd join me for my therapt sessions at times too, and having him there definitely made it easier to talk about hard things with mt therapist. When i was homeless for a short period of time he opened his room to me and let me stay for as long as i needed. I did everything I could think of to repay him, even when he didnt think it was necessary. I made him happy and he made me happy. The breakup felt like it came out of nowhere, but it also felt expected. Things have been exausting on both of our ends and..maybe it was for the better. But I hate it. I spent three hours crying and begging him to please change his mind, that we could work through any issue and if we couldnt do it on our own we could try couples therapy and if he just needed space i could give that to him. I begged and begged and questioned why he couldnt talk to me about it before. We were good at communicating most things - so why with this one could he not tell me? I talked and cried for so long that my throat felt like it was going to burst. He dropped me off at home after. He apologized and said that he didnt want the relationship to end and that he wanted it to work out, but that it was the best choice because he was afraid of things getting worse. He said that I was right, we probably were strong enough to work through anything but that he didnt have the patience or energy to. I tried so hard not to be exausting, but i failed. There is so much i regret having done and not done. I am in so much pain. We both said we'd hope to meet again in the future, he said he'd probably be the one to reach out and ask me out for a coffee. I told him to make it boba because we hated coffee so much. I want to hold onto that. The idea of him reaching out to me when things are better keeps me from crying sometimes, but the waiting for something that might not even happen is killing me. I love him so much and I've prayed to god, any god thay would listen, every day that he'll come back to me. I beg and beg god. I cant eat. My head is killing me. The feeling is unbearable. My face has never been so puffy before. I've cried everyday for hours on end since he left - sometimes I can barely see because my eyes are too puffy to open. Whenever i see him in my dreams i try to apologize and beg him, and when i cant ill hug him as hard as i can until i wake up. Nothing has felt real. I keep hoping that this is all one big nightmare and that ill wake up at any moment in his bed. I miss the way he smells. I dont want to die. I dont want to die at all. But sometimes the feeling becomes so unbearable that it'll make me physically sick. And ending it to rid myself of this awful feeling sounds so terrible but comforting. 

I know I sound stupid. But fuck. I hope he comes back. I would never blame any of my own actions on him. Thats cruel. And that's not what I'm trying to say. I just. I miss him. He made me happy. Even when i wanted to be angry i couldnt. ",1,1755996673.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

A man‚Äôs body lies on the sand. The winter trees stand bare, no leaves or snow. Police sirens flash across the body. A photographer snaps photos. A woman cries in the distance.

INT. PECK‚ÄôS BEDROOM - DAY

CARTER PECK, late 30s, sprawls across his bed. A used ashtray sits on the nightstand. Across the room, a smartphone rings.

Peck rises and lights a cigarette. He walks over to the phone and picks up.

PECK

Hello?

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

We got a case at Thomas Beach. McPherson‚Äôs waiting, partner.

Peck punches the wall in annoyance.

MALE VOICE (O.S.)

Are you still there?

PECK

Yeah, Fergie. I‚Äôll be there. Can you pick me up?

INT. FERGUSON‚ÄôS CAR - DAY

Peck sits in the passenger seat, wearing a coat. LUCAS FERGUSON, a detective of the same age, drives. He‚Äôs optimistic and anxious, only wearing dress clothes.

Peck opens his wallet. He extracts a photo of a middle-aged blonde woman and studies it. Ferguson glances in the sideview mirror.

FERGUSON

Am I going gray at all?

PECK

What?

Peck slides the photo back into the wallet. He gives Ferguson‚Äôs head a quick browse.

PECK

No, you‚Äôre okay. Aren‚Äôt you freezing?

FERGUSON

The news said today‚Äôs supposed to be in the 60s.

PECK

I‚Äôd trust some guy in an van before a meteorologist in Buffalo. You know better than that, dude.

FERGUSON

You mean like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, reading the label on a pack of Marlboros?

PECK

It‚Äôs not vaping.

FERGUSON

Peck, you smell like a chimney.

PECK

Would you relax, Fergie?

(beat)

Brand too. You should be in the K9 unit.

FERGUSON

Is something wrong?

Peck avoids eye contact.

FERGUSON

Hey, you can tell me.

PECK

Forget about it.

FERGUSON

You‚Äôll feel better today, man. We‚Äôve got plenty to focus on.

PECK

So white male, age forty-six, and...

Ferguson scrolls on his phone.

FERGUSON

Forty-six. Name Robbie Monaco. Wife, Lisa Monaco. Last night he‚Äî

PECK

Monaco. Monaco.

FERGUSON

He worked for Marvin Merchant.

PECK

Merchant? Seriously? So on New Year‚Äôs Eve, that means...

FERGUSON

We saw him and we didn‚Äôt know it. They found him face deep in the sand last night.

PECK

Poor guy.

FERGUSON

46. Makes you think, huh?

Peck shrugs.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Peck and Ferguson stand on the boardwalk. Their eyes can the space. Beside them is the grizzled chief of police, MCPHERSON. He holds a phone to his ear.

MCPHERSON

Thanks. See you.

McPherson hangs up.

FERGUSON

What did CSI say?

MCPHERSON

The full report will be out in a few days. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have much to see or do but stay put today...just in case. Detectives, you‚Äôve got the place to yourselves.

FERGUSON

And what are you doing?

MCPHERSON

My boys and I are gonna run a perimeter check. Best of luck.

Ferguson salutes McPherson. Ferguson shoots Peck an inquisitive look. This prompts Peck to salute McPherson as well. McPherson walks away and talks into his radio.

PECK

We‚Äôll need it.

FERGUSON

Where do you want to cover first?

A blonde-haired WOMAN approaches Peck and Ferguson.

FERGUSON

Excuse me, ma‚Äôam, this is an active crime scene.

JENNIFER

I‚Äôm sorry but my name‚Äôs Jennifer Dern. Robbie was a close friend of mine. When I heard what happened to him, I had to come down right away. See if I could help with the investigation.

FERGUSON

We appreciate that but-

PECK

Miss Dern, did you say you were close with Robbie?

JENNIFER

Yes.

PECK

How close?

JENNIFER

Am I under investigation?

PECK

No, just trying to see if you‚Äôre part of one.

FERGUSON

(to Peck)

Can I have a word with you?

Ferguson pulls Peck aside, out of Jennifer‚Äôs earshot.

FERGUSON

What are you doing?

PECK

She could be valuable, Fergie.

FERGUSON

They just handed us this case and you choose now to involve a civilian?

PECK

So?

FERGUSON

It‚Äôs risky.

PECK

This woman‚Äôs not just any civilian. And if I may add, did you see her eyes?

FERGUSON

No.

PECK

Stained. Reddish. Now that can mean anything but in the way they‚Äôre stained and reddish, you know what that means?

Before Ferguson can answer-

PECK

She was just crying. You still think it‚Äôs okay if we ask her to leave?

Ferguson thinks for a moment.

FERGUSON

I‚Äôll agree, there are worse ways to obtain intel. Don‚Äôt talk to her too long.

Peck‚Äôs eyes widen with anxiety.

PECK

Wait, hold on. What? I didn‚Äôt say I would talk with her.

FERGUSON

I don‚Äôt understand you.

PECK

What?

FERGUSON

Come on. You want one thing. Now you‚Äôre asking for something else.

PECK

You‚Äôre good at doing the talking. You would be a lot more at ease interviewing her. Trust me.

FERGUSON

We can‚Äôt have both. Do you want to be at ease, or do you want her to stay?

Peck stares off for a moment, then takes a deep breath.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Jennifer and a bored Peck walk along the shore. She fiddles with her bracelet.

PECK

Beautiful bracelet.

JENNIFER

Mrs. Monaco gave it to me.

PECK

Mrs. Monaco. How long have you known her for?

JENNIFER

Fourteen years. My husband‚Äôs been friends with her for decades.

PECK

Husband?

JENNIFER

Yeah but... I don‚Äôt consider myself married anymore.

PECK

I see.

JENNIFER

My husband has dementia.

PECK

Oh wow. Late-stage?

JENNIFER

Yep. It‚Äôs hard, but at least I get to visit him.

PECK

Of course. That‚Äôs more than some can say.

Peck looks down in awkwardness, then quickly steadies himself.

PECK

So how long did you know Robbie?

JENNIFER

I‚Äôve known him for years. The last time I saw him was last night. I had dinner with him and Lisa at the Tierney Inn.

PECK

When you were there, did you feel any tension between the couple?

JENNIFER

Lisa was fine. Robbie...

Jennifer is a little uneasy now.

JENNIFER

Everyone knows he worked too much.

PECK

Really?

JENNIFER

Merchant‚Äôs worked him like a mule and lately, Robbie seemed really on edge. When they put his steak on the table, I genuinely believed he was having a stroke.

Peck looks stunned.

PECK

I'll be honest. I never pegged Merchant for that kind of guy. Maybe I should talk to him.

JENNIFER

Maybe.

PECK

Is there anything else you wanted to tell me?

JENNIFER

I don‚Äôt have any other information. I just want closure on his death.

PECK

We‚Äôll try and help you, ma‚Äôam.

EXT. BEACH CLUBHOUSE - EVENING

Peck looks out at the lake from the balcony. Beside him, Ferguson shoots photos of the nearby sand, then joins him.

FERGUSON

Hell of a day, Peck. So, she have any good info?

PECK

Yeah. We‚Äôre also having coffee Friday.

FERGUSON

Nice. Wait, what? Where?

PECK

It‚Äôs at her house. I promise it‚Äôs business and nothing more.

FERGUSON

Well then I have to come too.

PECK

Well all right.

FERGUSON

Text me her address. I‚Äôll meet you over there.

PECK

ASAP?

FERGUSON

ASAP.

INT. JENNIFER‚ÄôS DINING ROOM - DAY

Peck and Jennifer sit at her large and quaint dining table. They sip coffee.

PECK

That‚Äôs about all she wrote. Everything we‚Äôve got so far.

JENNIFER

I really do appreciate you guys for doing this.

PECK

I don‚Äôt want to say your faith is misplaced but judging that my partner should‚Äôve been here...

Peck glances at his phone.

PECK

36 minutes ago, I‚Äôm starting to think otherwise.

JENNIFER

You‚Äôre an observant man.

PECK

Wouldn‚Äôt have made it this far if I wasn‚Äôt.

JENNIFER

What made you, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking, want to be a detective?

PECK

I‚Äôd say my wife.

JENNIFER

You're married? Sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

PECK

No, it‚Äôs all right. The idea of being a detective. She hated it but I joined the force anyways. Shortly after that, I never saw her again.

JENNIFER

Oh I‚Äôm sorry.

PECK

She didn‚Äôt leave a note. There was no warning. Nothing. Only months later ‚Äî and yes, that‚Äôs right ‚Äî I found out she ran off to Boston with some other guy. A banker or something. It left me confused. I was lost on what I was supposed to do. As a detective, I see it my duty to spare people of that. No matter what. Besides, you want to feel needed sometimes. Maybe. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm saying. Jennifer, I really‚Äî

A loud KNOCK at the door. Peck rises and goes to answer it.

INT. JENNIFER'S FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

He opens the door, revealing Ferguson outside.

PECK

Next time, I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúas soon as now.‚Äù

FERGUSON

Carter, I‚Äôm sorry. The strangest thing happened. So check it out. I was on my way then I get this call. McPherson. I talk to him, he sounds a little-

PECK

Whoa, slow down.

FERGUSON

My point is it‚Äôs strange and we should check it out.

Peck thinks for a moment, then nods. He heads back to the dining room, Ferguson behind him.

INT. JENNIFER'S DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

PECK

I‚Äôm sorry, but we have to go now.

JENNIFER

Detective, do you think I can see you again?

PECK

Yes. We‚Äôll meet again soon, Jennifer. I‚Äôll see you.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Peck and Ferguson walk toward Ferguson‚Äôs car.

PECK

Better be interesting. Where are we going?

FERGUSON

A neighborhood in Allentown. Right by the Dutch Bros near the airport.

Ferguson looks at Peck for a moment, noticing his anxiousness.

PECK

What is it?

FERGUSON

Everything all right?

PECK

Absolutely.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

A murder scene. Several cops wander around. On the concrete, a body lies under a blanket. A PHOTOGRAPHER takes shots of the area. Peck and Ferguson approach. They spy McPherson talking to a RESIDENT and walk over.

MCPHERSON

Good to see you guys.

PECK

Chief, what happened?

McPherson gestures for the resident to speak.

MR. CAMPBELL

I heard a shot fired at two a.m. I ran out. I found this guy bleeding on the ground. Then I called an ambulance.

MCPHERSON

It was too late.

FERGUSON

Jeez.

A police officer swings by.

ROBERTS

Hey, don‚Äôt you two have another case to handle?

PECK

We were nearby anyways, Roberts.

ROBERTS

If a guy drops dead at the beach, I‚Äôd be in my office 24/7. This here? Child‚Äôs play. Monaco deserves better, don‚Äôt you think?

Roberts walks off and Peck starts to move for him. Ferguson puts a hand on Peck‚Äôs shoulder, stopping him.

PECK

Douchebag. What‚Äôs his deal?

FERGUSON

Just let it go.

McPherson shows Peck and Ferguson a watch and wallet.

MCPHERSON

These were on his person.

Peck grabs the wallet and watch. He looks through the wallet.

PECK

Jonathan Curtis. Jonathan Curtis...

Peck wanders over to the body and lifts the blanket.

PECK

Fergie.

FERGUSON

What?

PECK

He was a developer. He worked for Merchant too.

MR. CAMPBELL

Merchant? The real estate guy?

MCPHERSON

Yeah, we all know him pretty well.

MR. CAMPBELL

Wow.

FERGUSON

What are you getting at, Peck?

Peck stares suspiciously at the watch and wallet in his hands.",0,1755996461.0,ReadMyScript,1,0.5,False

We were going to have a picnic out in the underground lake that I had set up the day before. It was the place we had first kissed and the place where we would spend our anniversary. Douggie and I had kindled our relationship back up. I think it‚Äôs because Douggie secretly likes Elizabeth, but he doesn't want to express it out of some kind of respect. Elizabeth and I walked through the same tunnel we had walked through tons of times, now having to pretend that it was just a normal trip back to the island. When we got there, I led her to a little cave on an off part of the island that was stashed behind a waterfall. Inside was a flannel blanket draped over a dry spot of moss tucked away on the left-hand side. I had stolen from the kitchen a package of her favorite snacks and candies that they had grown here. And the only outside food item that they served here was a package of fruit gummies.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I grabbed the blue ones‚Äù. She hurried over excitedly to retrieve the gummies. As well, I had stolen from the back of the maintenance room a bottle of wine. I didn‚Äôt know anything about alcohol, but I thought that it was fancy for a picnic. I pulled out the bottle and two glasses.¬†

‚ÄúOooh, fancy‚Äù. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this a bit much for just one picnic?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo, this is huge, it's been a year since I first brought you he, and we should celebrate‚Äù. We clinked our glasses together and said ‚ÄúCheers‚Äù.¬†

She pulled me in close and kissed me.¬†

‚ÄúLove you‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúLove you too‚Äù. We then played charades while we drank, and then swam for the rest of our time there. Heading back towards the beach and to our rocks to change.¬†

‚ÄúSo what are your thoughts on the school? I mean, you‚Äôve been here a little over a year now‚Äù.

¬†‚ÄúWell,l it has been pretty alright, but there have been some messed-up things happening here. Like, do you remember Sam?‚Äù

‚ÄúSam Taylor‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, Sam Taylor‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúThey hung him publicly on stage. They lynched him right in front of us‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúShit, I had forgotten all about that‚Äù.¬†

The memories hazily rushed back in like a fever dream that you look back on. I remember walking into the main auditorium room again with Elizabeth, holding her hand in mine. I let go as soon as I saw what was on stage. It was a noose. It was tied up in the rafters, hanging down a little over six feet off the ground. Standing right next to it, chipper as always was the Headmaster, his grim, sickly smile resonating like a yellowed scar. He called up Sam Taylor to the stage and had him stand next to him, restrained by his Iron grip.¬†

‚ÄúTHESE BOYS **AND GIRLS ARE MY NEW AND VERY VERY CLOSE FRIEND, D¬† SAM TAYLOR. WE HERE AT ST. OVADIS SCHOOL HAS BUILT UP A SOBER AND UPSTANDING COMMUNITY. BUT OUR FRIEND HERE S, A, I S A DIRTY, UNCLEAN ADDICT. SEE SAM HERE ABOUT TWICE A WEEK HAS BEEN BREAKING INTO OUR OFFICE TO FUEL HIS DIRTY DIRTY SECRET.

WHICH MEANS WE MUST¬† MAKE A SHOW OF FORCE THAT YOUR DIRTY ADDICTIONS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO FLOURISH OR SURVIVE, WHICH MEANS WE MUST CUT OFF THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE**‚Äù. He ushered two orderlies to lift his hip onto the chair and tighten the rope around his neck until his feet barely touched the chair.¬†

‚Äú**LAUGH AT HIM, LAUGH AT THE SINNER AS HE DANGLES AND DIES. HIS DEATH CLEANSING THE EARTH FROM HIS PUTRID FILTH**‚Äù. I remembered that he dangled for another few minutes before being brought down and dragged unceremoniously off stage.¬†¬†

‚ÄúGod, yeah, that was awful‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWhy do we let him do this?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHe controls everything, all the food, he's incredibly powerful‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúSo if respect is all that keeps a knife from his back, then respect is nothing‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWell, what do you want to do, start a revolution?‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we? There are thousands of students and only a couple hundred staff. You could gather up all the staff. Send off a handful of students to go get the police, and then bam, no more school‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWow, you really have thought a lot about this‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you ever thought about getting out of here, seeing your family again?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúMy family isn‚Äôt on the best of terms, and besides, who needs family when you have amazing friends and a loving partner?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt you want more, don't you want to live a full life, like learning to drive or going to high school?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúI mean, you get used to it after a decade‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúJust keep your head down and don‚Äôt step out of line‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúDid you ever learn about WW2, Marcus?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWell, back in the forties, the Germans hated the Jews‚Äù.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou know what a jew is, right?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, of course I do‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWell, back in Germany, they had these concentration camps where they would torture and kill the Jews for fun‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWe are in a concentration camp‚Äù. We talked on the beach there for maybe another fifteen minutes before we heard a rustling in the sand like a low pitter-patter, like the footsteps of a child trying to sneak down stairs to catch Santa.¬†

‚ÄúH-H-Helloooo‚Äù. I said into the empty void. Just then, a small raccoon darted out of the void. Causing me to fall backwards and soaking my arms in the lake water.¬†

‚ÄúHahahah, a what are you scared of, raccoons or something?‚Äù. As she said that, the nightmare I had had of the deformed raccoon reared its putrid head once more.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt like raccoons, and at least I‚Äôm not afraid of fish‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúHey, you promised never to bring that up. I told you that in secret‚Äù. We both sat there laughing and kissing each other until we moved back over to the canoe and paddled our way back to shore. To be met by Douggie smoking on the shore, propped up by a rock.¬†

‚ÄúAh, there are the two lovebirds I could hear you two from over here‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúGo jump off a cliff, Douggie‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúHey, what did I say to you two?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúFine, let's go get some dinner‚Äù. Later that night me Douggie and I were talking.¬†

‚ÄúHey, so what are we going to do when we get into our twenties and stuff?‚Äù. He breathed in a huge lungful of smoke, blowing it out into the room.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYou know when it's time to go to college‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúI dunno know bro‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúLike if you could choose where you wanted to go in life, man, like if you could get out of here, what would you do?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúProbably somewhere like uhh, Brazil or some place I heard they got some nice babes over there‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo, like seriously, what would you want to do with your life, ma?‚Äù.

¬†‚ÄúFirst off, when did you become a philosophical smoker dude, and I dunno like uh Stanford. Yeah, Stanford‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúReally, Stanford, do you think that you could get into Stanford University?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I hear they got a great astronautics program‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYou wanna be an astronaut?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, do you not think I can be an astronaut?‚Äù. He stood up and planted an invisible flag into the earth and said.¬†

‚ÄúTschh, this is Douggie to Houston, we have landed on Mars, one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind‚Äô‚Äù. I burst out laughing and said,¬†

‚ÄúOh my god, you really think that you are going to land on Mars?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, why not? It's not like you could. You know what they say, shoot for the moon so that even if you miss, you‚Äôll land among the stars‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúMhhm, sure bud‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúGod, I gotta get to bed, can‚Äôt have Elizabeth finding out I‚Äôm staying up late smoking again, I just got her off my back for catching me that time in the garden‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúOkay, dude, you have your sleep, I‚Äôma stay up a little bit longer. Hey, by the way, what got you all like that? You know all that uhh radical thinking about what life could be like outside of here.¬†

‚ÄúElizabeth told me all about being on the outside and doing all these things‚Äù.¬†¬†

I hated going to bed after a smoke session. The nightmares always came back if I smoked before bed. I always tried to give myself a good hour and a half for it to wear off before bed. But tonight I didn‚Äôt get that luxury. I was standing in the headmasters office everything looked normal but certain things looked off everything was rearranged or maybe mirrored I don‚Äôt know but what I did see disturbed me to my core resting in the corner impaled through the stomach on a stake was Elizabeth here body displayed graphically and grotesquely her blood flowed like a crimson stream down onto the stake which trickled down to a red pool of her blood. I nearly vomited and couldn‚Äôt tell if that also happened in real life or not. I tried to scream, but the only noise that came out was my muffled murmur. Just then, a huge machine sprouted out of the ground and was strapped to it. I watched as the parts moved further and further away. I tried to free myself, but when I did, the metal that held me burst into flames. As I moved to try to escape, a copy of me appeared in front of me with the Headmaster standing next to him. A copy of me was crying profusely as he gripped a knife in his hands. I opened my mouth, but all that came out was a hoarse groan. Jus, the copy of me, plunged the huge knife into my stomach. I could feel the pain surge through my body like a bolt of lightning. I could feel blood gush from my stomach as another groan erupted from my throat. In my skull, it felt like thunder, but the actual noise was barely even audible. The knife was ripped from my chest and pushed back in on the other side. Blood squirted from his wound like a morbid water fountain. I was spluttering with blood like a car stuck in a pile of mud. I spat out mouthful after mouthful of blood from my throat. As the third and final stab pushed into my lung, I felt my whole body go limp, and my head rolled back like a yo-yo. My eyes turned back into my skull. All the wounds went cold, and I was dropped from the machine onto a pile of books. I knew what was going to happen next as the cold liquid hit my body, stinging onto the wounds. I let one final heave of air from my body, symbolizing the last ounce of life extinguishing from my body. Just as I let out the final breath, I felt an immense heat cover my body as the match hit my chest. I awoke from the nightmare with a staggering jolt. I saw a slight twinkle of the sunrise peeking out over the horizon. I walked through the halls to Elizabeth‚Äôs room to wake her up and ask her if she wanted to watch the sunrise with me, but I didn‚Äôt see her in her room. I started panicking, wondering where she had gone. I ran down to the cafeteria to see if she was there and saw her grabbing a cup of coffee next to the food bar. I joined her and grabbed myself a warm cup of tea, as I hated the taste of coffee. To me, it tasted like poison. I can even now recall her usual coffee choice. She always had a coffee with two packets of water and one creamer with a dash of honey. I grabbed my cup of tea and squirted some honey into my cup.¬†

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt sleep?‚Äù.

¬†‚ÄúNo, you‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúMe neither‚Äù.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWas it the nightmares again?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo (I lied,) you know I don‚Äôt get those unless I smoke before bed‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWanna join me to watch the sunrise?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúSure, I've got nothing better to do‚Äù. We sat on the front of the steps looking out at the sunrise.¬†

‚ÄúDid you know that right now it looks like how Pluto does during noon?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúNo, where‚Äôd you hear that?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúDouggie, he‚Äôs been reading about a lot of planetary facts. He also tells me that Pluto is his favorite planet in the solar system‚Äù. We sat there quietly sipping our coffee and tea, just living in the moment, wrapped up in a soft throw blanket we took from her bed. We sat there with our heads on each other's shoulders. I could hear her gentle breathing, and my whole world was at peace. It was moments like that that made me feel at peace in the world.¬†

‚ÄúYou know, Marcu, that's what's stopping us from running away right now, ow like you know just climbing up those walls and running away to the next town‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúAbout thirteen feet of pure stone and metal‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúBut like what if we just climbed up the walls and ran away?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúDouggie. I can‚Äôt leave Douggie here; he would have to come with us‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúWell, if he were here and we just ran away, what would stop us?‚Äù.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù. We sat there quietly, breathing in the fresh early morning air.

I did an exclusionary diet, and found that a major trigger was eggs, alcohol, coffee (tim hortons/Dunkin - the stuff I make at home seems fine) and too much sugar. 

Fast forward to the last year, I have been having heartburn (particularly when I eat something fatty), gas and my IBS is fluctuating. 

Well, 4 days ago, I had a diarrhea episode that produced a ton of mucous and there was little flecks of red blood in it. Managed to get an appointment with my GP today. She didn't hesitate and made a referral for a colonoscopy and Endoscopy. 

In truth, I haven't had consistent blood, but since 2017, this would be my 3rd time seeing flecks of blood. 1st time I believe was due to a food poisoning from a burger. Funny enough, the other day when it happened, I had had meatloaf for dinner the nigt before....not sure if there is a connection there. I am still really bloated, and have pain on the left side, but passing small amounts of gas and  have been passing normal stool for 3 days with no visible signs of blood since but I'd be lying if I said my anus felt fine. It stings a little, which is new for me. Hoping that will get better. Just worried in general, trying not to think cancer, but it's kicking around in my mind....

Does anyone know if the endo/colon(oscopies) can be done at the same time (hopefully not with the same scope - lol (sorry nervous))? And in experience, how long was the wait to get an actual appointment? (if you're in Canada, the answer may be more predictive).

A room is available in our 4-bedroom, 2-bathroom house, just one mile from the UCR campus. The lease runs from September 1, 2025, through September 2026. My two other roommates and I, all UCR students, are looking for a fourth housemate. We are looking to make a decision very soon, so the first month's rent and deposit must be ready by August 25th to secure the room for a September 1st move-in.

The base rent is $800 per month, plus utilities (typically $50-$100). You‚Äôll get your own private room in a house perfect for student life. We have a washer, dryer, dishwasher, a large living room, and a backyard. Parking is available in the garage or on the street. The location is excellent‚Äîa quick 10-15 minute walk or a 5-minute bike ride to campus near Lot 30. The Canyon Crest shops are also just a 5-minute walk away, so you'll be close to groceries and other necessities.

We are all UCR students who are serious about our studies but also enjoy a relaxed and social home. We often hang out and are always open to grabbing coffee or food together. We're looking for a responsible and communicative housemate who is considerate of quiet hours and shared boundaries. We want someone who wants a calm, welcoming home but is also happy to hang out sometimes. Unfortunately, we can't have any pets due to allergies.

For convenience, I handle paying the landlord and utilities, so you don't have to worry about the hassle. We also often share rides to campus or the store. Our landlord is easy to work with and gives us our space, which we appreciate. We're open to anyone who is a good fit for our easygoing dynamic.

If this sounds like a good fit, let me know! I can send you photos and videos for a virtual tour. Since we're moving on this quickly, please don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested!",1,1755996144.0,ucrhousing,0,1.0,False

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

No matter what I do, I cannot seem to get it JUST right.


Either the grind is too fine and the water just creates a path through the grounds and a third or half of it is still dry at the very end. 

Or the grind is too coarse and it runs through too quickly and I basically get coffee ‚Äútea‚Äù.

I do a 10:1 ratio of water to coffee.

The thing is, I've never been able to get myself to like alcohol, whether it's beer, red wine, cider, or anything at all. It's just not my thing. 

BUT for some time now I've wanted to learn about whiskey because I feel that unlike beer, the whole ritual of preparing a glass of whiskey is more intimate, and I really like thatThe simple idea of coming home after work or college, watching YT with my dog and having the house to myself + dim lights + a good glass of whiskey is something I'm excited to try.

The only whiskey that perhaps can't even be considered authentic is Jack Daniel's honey lemon and I liked it quite a bit. And I have sweeter or slightly acidic tastes (like a good lemonade)

40s: You broke his heart.
20s: I broke both our hearts. It wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt love him; our circumstance was just impossible. 
40s: Well he came knocking on MY door with his broken heart and busted up shoulder, and holed up while he licked his wounds. 
20s: He‚Ä¶stayed with you? How‚Ä¶how long?
40s: 3 months.
20s looked absolutely leveled. She stood up, put some money on the table and walked out.
40s finished her pie and coffee and stared into the distance looking tired and sad.

1myhqcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Midnightcreepypasta0/comments/1myhqcp/my_job_at_the_lighthouse_was_only_ever_temporary/,My job at the lighthouse was only ever temporary,"I didn‚Äôt come here to disappear.  
I was already pretty much invisible.

After the divorce, the flat got too loud in that way empty rooms do. Every pipe a throat, every radiator a mouth. I was thirty-nine and already felt like a ghost haunting my own furniture. I‚Äôd done a dozen jobs that left no dent in the world: warehouse picker, night shift at a printer‚Äôs, five long years repairing cash machines. Every payslip felt like a receipt for time I‚Äôd never get back.

No friends. No kids. No reason to stay.

So when I saw the vague ad in the paper, I thought‚Äîwhy not?

*Temporary, Seasonal attendant required. North cliff lighthouse. Solo position. No experience required.*

How hard could it be? Just a light on a cliff that needed winding and checking, and someone to swear at the wind on its behalf.

At least out there I‚Äôd be lonely on purpose.

I told the harbourmaster I didn‚Äôt drink (a lie), that I was good with my hands (true), and that I could handle nights (truer than I wanted it to be). He looked at me for a long time like he was measuring silence on me, seeing if it would fit.

‚ÄúYou alright being on your own?‚Äù he asked. Then, quickly, ‚ÄúNot ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre a woman, I mean, fog‚Äôs worse this year. Claustrophobic stuff. You‚Äôll taste it before you see it.‚Äù

He was right about that. Salt settles on your tongue out here like dust on a shelf. Even with the door bolted and the windows latched, the brine finds its way in, tiny white crusts forming in the corners of the lantern room. But there‚Äôs something under that. The air tastes metallic too, like licking a coin or biting a split lip.

The first night, I learned the staircase by touch because the power tripped the second I plugged in the kettle.

The cast-iron treads were cold enough to sting. The trick is to lead with your palm, not your fingers. Saves you from cuts, splinters, and worse. Halfway up, there‚Äôs a postcard-sized window. You have to lean close to see through it, and if you press your cheek to the stone, it‚Äôll steal your heat like a debt collector.

Now I keep real thermal gloves stashed everywhere and a thermos of coffee on the service shelf. Next to it sits the logbook, angry, cramped handwriting stretching back decades. The entries read like prayers:

*Wound at 21:05.*  
*Cleaned bulb*  
*Horn 00:30, 01:00, 01:30.*  
*Wind SW 18 kt. Fog persistent.*  
*Fog persistent.*  
*Fog persistent.*

There‚Äôs a comfort in tasks that have edges. Check the bulbs. Wind the clockwork. Clean the glass. When the lamp is lit and the lens begins its slow rotation, the whole room changes‚Äîas if the tower takes a breath and remembers why it was built. The brass warms. The glass blurs and clears, blurs and clears. Every seventy seconds the beam passes, and the world outside appears in a white slice: spray leaping from black rock, the cliff path slick and mean.

Onshore, the town is just a smudge of orange, the sodium lamps tucked into the fold of the headland.

Out here, it‚Äôs me, the machinery, and the sea making its long arguments against the cliff. The horn is mounted lower, where the tower thickens like a throat. It isn‚Äôt the cartoonish blare you hear in films. It‚Äôs a deep animal note, more felt than heard, a pressure that rattles your ribs. When it goes, the glass trembles in its frame, the tea shivers in your mug, and you taste brass in your mouth.

I sleep in the watch room on a cot older than my mother. Sleep is a generous word. The mattress has a ridge down the middle like a fence. I padded it with forgotten coats and the flattened cushions from the room‚Äôs only armchair. It‚Äôs good enough. Better an uncomfortable bed here than the uncomfortable silence of home.

I keep telling myself I came for peace, but the peace here isn‚Äôt quiet. The weather has teeth.

The first week, I played games with myself to keep from thinking too loudly. I‚Äôd count the steps (seventy-eight to the lantern room, if you skip the cracked one). I‚Äôd try to drink my coffee before the next sweep of the light caught my face. I‚Äôd time the horn blasts to the second and reward myself with a biscuit when I hit three in a row.

On the fifth night, I started hearing water where there wasn‚Äôt any.

Not the roar you expect from the sea. This was smaller, meaner. The sound a tap makes when you didn‚Äôt turn it off quite enough. I hunted it with a torch, ear to pipes, hand to walls, following that thin silver noise down into the service level where the stone smells like damp metal and mould. Dry. Everything was dry. But the sound threaded the night all the same, just at the edge of thought, like a song you hate stuck behind your teeth.

I wrote it off as the wind working some loose sash. I logged it as if naming a thing makes it behave.  
*22:10 Dripping noise. Source unclear.*

I was raised to be practical, to rely on myself. My father taught me to check the obvious thing first‚Äîif a car won‚Äôt start, jiggle the battery lead before you condemn the alternator. After the marriage ended, after I stopped answering messages that opened with¬†*Hey, stranger*, I started to measure my days in things I could fix. The light is good for that. If it doesn‚Äôt turn, you wind. If it burns too low, you trim. If the horn fails, you pull the choke and try again until the note opens over the water like a door.

Sometimes, between horn blasts, something like quiet falls. You hear the tower settling, your blood in your ears, the sea rearranging stones below. Sometimes, if you let yourself, you can almost believe the fog is just weather. That it isn‚Äôt watching back.

On the seventh night, it came in thick. I tasted it on the stairs before I saw it. The air went soft and damp; my arms sugar-coated with salt. The lantern room fogged from the outside like a breath on glass. The beam pushed through and carved a tunnel of light in the murk, everything beyond erased. The horn note wobbled, then steadied, like a throat clearing.

I don‚Äôt scare easy. Not bragging. You can teach fear to stand in the corner if you give it enough chores. But there‚Äôs a kind of wrong that doesn‚Äôt arrive with bangs and screams. It pads in, makes itself at home in the part of your brain that keeps lists. It makes you doubt your own edges.

Close to midnight, I was standing with my knuckles on the rail, watching the beam make its slow sweep, when I felt it, a change in the room that wasn‚Äôt temperature or sound. A prickle at the nape, an itch in my teeth, that childhood sense that someone just said your name in a room you haven‚Äôt entered yet.

The light slid across the fog and for a heartbeat the world sharpened like a knife on a whetstone. The tunnel showed nothing but vapour and white noise, particles racing like snow in a torch beam.

The light moved on. The room exhaled. My shoulders loosened without permission.

And somewhere below me, out on the gallery in that thick white, something tapped against the metal rail, sharp and deliberate.

Not a bang. Not the jump-scare I probably deserved. Four neat taps, patient as a metronome.

I told myself it was grit or pebbles, maybe kicked up by the wind and flung against the rail from below. A stretch, but easier than admitting what it sounded like. I wrote none of it in the log.

Instead I wrote the tasks, small anchors against larger weather:  
*Cleaned prisms.*  
*Checked bulb housing and backup wiring.*  
*Horn 00:00, 00:30.*  
*Fog persistent.*

When you‚Äôre alone long enough, your thoughts have your back, They say sensible things, sometimes... They keep their hands in their pockets. That night they were unusually kind to me.¬†*It‚Äôs rocks,*¬†they said.¬†*It‚Äôs wind. It‚Äôs the tower stretching its bones. Nothing to do with you.*

I made another circuit of the stairs, palm leading the way, the rail slick and honest under my skin. Back in the watch room I tried sleep, the padding giving me no relief from the thin mattress ridge digging into my spine. I listened for the drip that had by now become by lullaby and found none. so I lay there, awake. The horn beat the hours like a slow heart and The beam kept time on the walls.

I told myself I‚Äôd check the lantern glazing in the morning. I told myself there was no ‚Äúbelow me,‚Äù really, only air the black percussion of the sea. I told myself anything that might make the skin on my arms lie down.

But the next pass of the light brought the same electric feeling along the back of my neck.

And the pass after that brought the taps again, metallic, rattling up through the rail into my hands. Four, exactly. Four, exactly, like an answer.

I didn‚Äôt touch the logbook after that.

I stood with the beam at my shoulder, the horn rattling my ribs, the taste of brass in my mouth. Very quietly, I counted my breathing until dawn made a weak suggestion at the window.

The fog didn‚Äôt lift.  
It just pretended to be thinner where morning could see it.

When I finally unlatched the door and stepped out onto the gallery, water beaded on my eyelashes and salt stung a cut I don‚Äôt remember earning. Down below, the rocks were greased black, kelp combed flat by the tide. The rail where the tapping had sounded was empty, slick with damp, wearing nothing but a skin of condensation and a dusting of salt, the way it always does.

I told myself a new lie: that sleep, and only sleep, would fix this.

That night, the foghorn felt heavier in my hands. The note went out over the water like a hand laid on a shoulder. And for the first time, when it died away, I listened not for silence

but for an answer.

By the second week, I‚Äôd stopped marking the days properly. The logbook was supposed to keep me straight, but the handwriting had already started to slip, neat rows turning into jagged scrawls. I‚Äôd catch myself writing the wrong hour, or repeating the same line twice as if time had folded in on itself.

I tried to blame it on sleep, but the truth is I wasn‚Äôt sleeping. Not really. I‚Äôd shut my eyes and hear that rattle on the rail, feel the vibration in my bones, wait for it to come again. Sometimes it did. Sometimes it didn‚Äôt. Which was worse.

¬†I thought I saw something stranger than fog one early afternoon. A white bird on the gallery rail. Too bright against the mist, out of place. It tilted its head at me, sharp and knowing, It was the most unusual crow id ever seen, I tried to creep closer to get a better view but it slipped back into the fog as if it had never been there. I told myself it was exhaustion, but I kept waiting for it to come back.

The fog never left. It thickened and thinned, like a lung drawing breath, but it never let go of the tower. During the day it was a dull white sheet, the sea and sky erased. At night it pressed close, blackening at the edges of the lamp‚Äôs tunnel, and I swear it pulsed with the horn like a thing alive.

I started keeping a second notebook, hidden under the cot. Not the official log, just scribbles of things I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to record in neat ink in fear of being branded crazy:

*Tap. Four times. 02:15.*  
*Heard footsteps on gallery. Checked. Empty.*  
*Foghorn vibrated before I touched the choke.*  
*Something whispered back?.*

That last one I tried to cross out so hard the paper tore.

The strangest part? I still did the work. Bulbs checked, glass cleaned, gears wound. I still boiled the kettle, still counted steps, still rationed my biscuits like a kid saving sweets. But the edges of my world had started to blur. Sometimes I‚Äôd walk the stairs and find myself at the wrong level, unsure if I‚Äôd gone up or down. Sometimes I‚Äôd catch a reflection in the lantern glass and think there was someone else in the room.

On the ninth night, I saw them.

Not clearly, not the way I wanted. Just a smear of shape in the beam‚Äôs sweep. But it wasn‚Äôt a gull, or spray, or a shadow. It was taller, straighter. A human outline standing where no footing should exist, just fog and air and the drop to the rocks. By the time the beam came round again, it was gone.

I didn‚Äôt log it. I barely trusted myself to think it.

The next night, there were three.

They stood at different heights out in the fog, far enough from the tower to make no sense, but close enough to see. Perfectly still. Perfectly wrong. My stomach turned like I was in freefall, but I couldn‚Äôt move. I gripped the brass rail until my hands went white. When the beam passed again, they‚Äôd shifted, i couldn't be certain but I'm sure it was a fraction nearer.

I nearly choked myself on the foghorn cord trying to get the sound out fast enough. I prayed the monstrous noise would create sound waves powerful enough to disturb the uncanny patterns made by the fog and light.

the note roared into the dark, shaking the tower. For a moment I felt relief.¬†

Until all three figures lifted their heads at once, like the sound was calling them home.

I didn‚Äôt sleep after that. Couldn‚Äôt. Every sweep of the light brought them back. Every blast of the horn seemed to tighten whatever tether was pulling them in. I sat with my back to the wall, mug of coffee clutched like a weapon, whispering bargains to myself.

*If they reach the glass, I‚Äôll run. If they step onto the gallery, I‚Äôll jump. If they make a sound, I‚Äôll‚Ä¶*

I never finished that one.

By dawn they were gone. Through the night they seemed to shift a little closer with each pass of the lantern, never reaching the tower but always shrinking the distance. As the sun crept back into existence they thinned and faded with the fog.

And in their place, on the rail where they had been staring all night, the white crow perched again. Too bright against the dim dawn, it tilted its head, watching me in silence before vanishing back into the fog‚Äîas if it had been bearing witness the entire time.

By the third week, I‚Äôd stopped pretending this was routine. The tower ran on its own rhythm, light turning, horn groaning, gears ticking, but I was the one falling out of sync. My hands shook even when they weren‚Äôt on the rail. My coffee tasted like brine. My own reflection in the lantern glass startled me more than once.

The second notebook grew messy. Sentences trailed into nonsense, words scrawled at angles I didn‚Äôt remember writing. Pages smeared where my hand had sweated through the ink. One night I woke with the pen still in my fist, a line etched over and over until it carved the paper:

*They are closer.*

The fog pressed tighter, damp clinging in my clothes. The whole tower felt smaller. I paced the stairs to keep myself awake, but more than once I reached a landing and couldn‚Äôt tell if I was climbing up or down. Once I circled and circled, breath ragged, until I realised I‚Äôd been walking past the same window slit for nearly half an hour. When I leaned out to check, there was nothing but blank fog. Nothing, except the faint scrape of something against the stone.

I stopped opening the logbook. What was the point of writing¬†*bulb checked*¬†or¬†*gear wound*¬†when the real notes were carved into my bones?

The figures returned night after night. Each time the sun fell, they were back in the fog, always starting from the same impossible distance as if rewound by dawn, and each sweep of the lamp drew them forward again.

The figures were no longer just outlines. On the twelfth night, the beam caught the pale suggestion of faces‚Äîblurred, waterlogged, but watching. Their posture was wrong: heads too still, bodies leaning just enough to look like they were falling without ever touching the ground. Each sweep stole another fraction of the distance. I swore I saw breath pluming in the cold when the light brushed them.

The horn betrayed me worst of all. I pulled the cord, and instead of repelling, the vibration came first, shivering through the rail, crawling up into my chest, then they shifted. All of them, as one. Like the horn had given them permission.

I stopped blasting it, but the silence was worse. I could feel them waiting for it, like dogs starved for a whistle.

That was the night the white crow came back. Not at dawn this time, but deep in the hours before morning. I found it sitting on the gallery rail, feathers glowing faint against the lamp‚Äôs beam. It didn‚Äôt caw. Didn‚Äôt move. Just tilted its head at me, eyes dark as the fog behind it. For a second I thought if I leaned close enough, it would speak.

I don‚Äôt know why, but I whispered to it. Asked it what they wanted. Asked it if it was here for me. Asked it if I was supposed to keep the light burning, or let it die.

The crow blinked, once. And then the fog swallowed it.

By dawn, the figures had retreated again. The white crow returned with the morning too, perching on the rail like it owned the place. I‚Äôd started leaving scraps of bread for it, offerings, maybe. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was an omen or a protector, but since the figures hadn‚Äôt stepped onto the gallery itself, I let myself believe it was keeping them back. Hoping it was.

But even after dawn the rail seemed to hum faintly, like it had held onto something that wasn‚Äôt mine. Not the horn this time, something else. I couldn‚Äôt shake the sense the tower itself was carrying their presence forward, holding a trace of them that would only end once they were inside with me.

By the fourth week, the tower didn‚Äôt feel like mine anymore. It felt borrowed, or worse, shared. The air inside was never still. The walls had a pulse I could feel through my palms when I leaned against them. I‚Äôd wake choking on panic, certain something was in the room with me, a terror that makes you bite down on your own fist to keep quiet. My thoughts whispered that there was no need for silence, that I was alone. But the dread clawing at my chest told me better: I was far from alone.

I stopped pretending the figures came and went. They reset, yes, but the rail still thrummed each morning like it had carried something up from the fog. I knew they hadn‚Äôt left at all. They were simply waiting for the chance to start again. Every dawn felt like a reprieve I hadn‚Äôt earned.

There was no question of leaving. The tower sits on a rock cut off from the mainland, the supply boat long overdue, the cliff path drowned under fog. I tried the radio more than once, but the harbourmaster‚Äôs voice never sounded surprised. Almost like he already knew what circled the lighthouse. Every call ended the same way, him telling me to keep the lamp turning, then cutting the line. That‚Äôs when the fear deepened: if he knew, and still left me here, then what chance did I have? I thought about the coats I‚Äôd found on my first day, hanging forgotten in the watch room. Too many for one keeper. I‚Äôd wondered then why they were left behind. Now I think I know. I imagine their owners running down these same stairs, pressing the same rail, whispering the same promises to themselves until the night took them too.

The white crow came every dawn without fail, black eyes fixed on me while I placed bread on the rail. The first time it ate, I thought I imagined it. The second time, I watched crumbs tumble from its beak and scatter into the mist. I didn‚Äôt know if I was bribing a guardian or feeding a harbinger, but either way I couldn‚Äôt stop. The ritual mattered now. If I kept the crow fed, maybe it kept the gallery safe. Maybe.

But safe didn‚Äôt last.

On the fifteenth night, I heard them¬†*through*¬†the stairs. Not outside, not in the fog, inside the tower‚Äôs bones, as if the sound was being carried up the iron itself. My throat closed. My torch beam shook so hard I could hardly keep the light steady on the steps. Every instinct screamed at me to run, but where to? Down into the dark? Up into the lantern room with nowhere to hide? The air was damp and sour in my mouth. Nothing there. Nothing but the faint echo of weight where no one should be. I pressed my ear to the rail and the vibration that came back wasn‚Äôt the steady thrum of machinery. It was a rhythm. Four steps. A pause. Four steps again.

I ran the rest of the way down, heart punching against my ribs, half expecting to feel a hand close on my shoulder. Every time I stopped to listen, silence filled the gap. But when I touched the rail‚Äîalways the rail, it carried the memory of footsteps that weren‚Äôt mine. A memory you can‚Äôt scrub out.

The crow didn‚Äôt appear that dawn. I left the bread anyway, hands shaking so badly I nearly dropped it. The thought of losing even that thin comfort made my stomach hollow with dread.

On the seventeenth night, the figures were so close I could see the glisten of water running from their hair. They leaned against the fog as if it were glass, pressing toward the tower. When the beam cut across them, their heads lifted in perfect unison. Not fast. Not jerky. Just a slow tilt, like they‚Äôd been waiting for me to look. My teeth ached from clenching, my breath tearing at my throat.

The silence between horn blasts felt like held breath. Mine, or theirs, I couldn‚Äôt tell. I kept thinking‚Äîif I breathe too loud, they‚Äôll hear.

By the twentieth night, I stopped writing completely. The notebooks sat in the watch room drawer, pages curling from damp. All I had left were muttered promises to myself.¬†*Stay awake. Keep the light moving. Feed the crow. Don‚Äôt let the rail go quiet.*

Because when the rail finally goes still, I think it will mean they‚Äôve stepped inside.

¬†By the fifth week, I was barely human. My body ran on seconds of sleep stolen at the desk, head snapping up at the smallest creak. I tried everything, piling coats against the door, wedging tools through the handles, even dragging the cot across the floor as if flimsy metal could stop what moved in the fog. None of it helped. The tower was never mine, never safe.

Nights had become something I dreaded with a sick, sinking weight in my chest. I would sit staring at the lamp, wondering what would happen if I simply let it go dark. If I killed the beam, the figures might lose their path‚Äîbut ships out at sea would lose theirs too. How many sailors would wreck against these rocks if I chose myself over them? The thought made me sick, but the temptation stayed.

The tower itself felt like a trap. Every wall pressed inward, every stair twisted tighter. I barely recognised my own voice when I muttered to myself, raw and rasping from nights without rest. Coffee did nothing. Fear had chewed straight through the caffeine, leaving me wired and hollow.

The figures no longer waited in the fog; they had crept beyond their usual stopping point. They pressed right to the edge of the gallery, only a sweep of the lamp between us. When the beam moved on, they shifted forward, bodies leaning into the metal rail as if testing it, weight dragging against the iron. Their outlines were warped by the fog, faces pale and waterlogged, hair plastered against skulls, clothes hanging in strips that fluttered without wind. Their eyes glistened too dark, too steady, fixed on me no matter how the beam moved. And worse, I recognised them. The pale features, the soaked uniforms, the warped faces were the same as the staff photos still hanging in the watch room, men and women who should have been long gone. Now they stood outside, dripping and silent, staring in. I could hear the scrape now, groaning as if the rail itself might give way.

On the final sweep of the lamp before dawn, I saw them on the gallery itself, right outside the window. One had its hand pressed flat against the glass, water trailing down its fingers, while another hovered inches from the door handle. I pressed myself against the far wall, too terrified to move, lungs locked tight as if even breathing might draw them in. Every time the light passed, they froze again, mannequins posed by a cruel hand. And every time it moved on, they edged closer.

The crow came later that morning,, I left bread with shaking fingers, whispering bargains I barely understood. Protect me. Keep them off the gallery. Don‚Äôt let them in. The bird never answered, only watching with that tilted head, feathers glowing too bright against the grey.

The harbourmaster stopped answering my calls. Just static now, hissing in my ear. Sometimes I thought I heard voices under it, muffled and distant, like others calling from the fog. I snapped the radio off and shoved it in the drawer with the notebooks. When I did, a loose scrap fluttered free, torn from a page not written in my hand. The handwriting was tight, frantic.¬†*The sea needs to eat. The lighthouse is the plate. The foghorn is the dinner bell. These figures are‚Ä¶*¬†The line ended jagged, ripped short. I stared at it until the words blurred. Better silence than that.

I know tonight is the night they‚Äôll get in. They want me to go with them, to feed the sea, or whatever waits inside it.

I have Two choices. Accept my fate and join the others, or kill the light and doom the sailors who trust me to keep them safe. The fog is thick and the cliffs are¬† unforgiving. Even a seasoned captain wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance without this beam.

The advert was honest about one thing: this job was only ever temporary.

She told me that it had not been turned on in years and that I needed to find a charger for it, so I went ahead and ordered one. The Ipod worked, but only while it was plugged in, so after some research I learned that I needed to solder a new batter inside of it. While I was prying the thing open, I broke the lcd screen, so naturally I ordered a new one. Replacing everything was easier than I expected, but the rear housing would not clip. I even tried ordering a new rear housing and it still does not work, so I settled with ordering a hard leather case to hold it together.

1myhmvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1myhmvm/my_job_at_the_lighthouse_was_only_ever_temporary/,My Job at the Lighthouse Was Only Ever Temporary.,"I didn‚Äôt come here to disappear.  
I was already pretty much invisible.

After the divorce, the flat got too loud in that way empty rooms do. Every pipe a throat, every radiator a mouth. I was thirty-nine and already felt like a ghost haunting my own furniture. I‚Äôd done a dozen jobs that left no dent in the world: warehouse picker, night shift at a printer‚Äôs, five long years repairing cash machines. Every payslip felt like a receipt for time I‚Äôd never get back.

No friends. No kids. No reason to stay.

So when I saw the vague ad in the paper, I thought‚Äîwhy not?

*Temporary, Seasonal attendant required. North cliff lighthouse. Solo position. No experience required.*

How hard could it be? Just a light on a cliff that needed winding and checking, and someone to swear at the wind on its behalf.

At least out there I‚Äôd be lonely on purpose.

I told the harbourmaster I didn‚Äôt drink (a lie), that I was good with my hands (true), and that I could handle nights (truer than I wanted it to be). He looked at me for a long time like he was measuring silence on me, seeing if it would fit.

‚ÄúYou alright being on your own?‚Äù he asked. Then, quickly, ‚ÄúNot ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre a woman, I mean, fog‚Äôs worse this year. Claustrophobic stuff. You‚Äôll taste it before you see it.‚Äù

He was right about that. Salt settles on your tongue out here like dust on a shelf. Even with the door bolted and the windows latched, the brine finds its way in, tiny white crusts forming in the corners of the lantern room. But there‚Äôs something under that. The air tastes metallic too, like licking a coin or biting a split lip.

The first night, I learned the staircase by touch because the power tripped the second I plugged in the kettle.

The cast-iron treads were cold enough to sting. The trick is to lead with your palm, not your fingers. Saves you from cuts, splinters, and worse. Halfway up, there‚Äôs a postcard-sized window. You have to lean close to see through it, and if you press your cheek to the stone, it‚Äôll steal your heat like a debt collector.

Now I keep real thermal gloves stashed everywhere and a thermos of coffee on the service shelf. Next to it sits the logbook, angry, cramped handwriting stretching back decades. The entries read like prayers:

*Wound at 21:05.*  
*Cleaned bulb*  
*Horn 00:30, 01:00, 01:30.*  
*Wind SW 18 kt. Fog persistent.*  
*Fog persistent.*  
*Fog persistent.*

There‚Äôs a comfort in tasks that have edges. Check the bulbs. Wind the clockwork. Clean the glass. When the lamp is lit and the lens begins its slow rotation, the whole room changes‚Äîas if the tower takes a breath and remembers why it was built. The brass warms. The glass blurs and clears, blurs and clears. Every seventy seconds the beam passes, and the world outside appears in a white slice: spray leaping from black rock, the cliff path slick and mean.

Onshore, the town is just a smudge of orange, the sodium lamps tucked into the fold of the headland.

Out here, it‚Äôs me, the machinery, and the sea making its long arguments against the cliff. The horn is mounted lower, where the tower thickens like a throat. It isn‚Äôt the cartoonish blare you hear in films. It‚Äôs a deep animal note, more felt than heard, a pressure that rattles your ribs. When it goes, the glass trembles in its frame, the tea shivers in your mug, and you taste brass in your mouth.

I sleep in the watch room on a cot older than my mother. Sleep is a generous word. The mattress has a ridge down the middle like a fence. I padded it with forgotten coats and the flattened cushions from the room‚Äôs only armchair. It‚Äôs good enough. Better an uncomfortable bed here than the uncomfortable silence of home.

I keep telling myself I came for peace, but the peace here isn‚Äôt quiet. The weather has teeth.

The first week, I played games with myself to keep from thinking too loudly. I‚Äôd count the steps (seventy-eight to the lantern room, if you skip the cracked one). I‚Äôd try to drink my coffee before the next sweep of the light caught my face. I‚Äôd time the horn blasts to the second and reward myself with a biscuit when I hit three in a row.

On the fifth night, I started hearing water where there wasn‚Äôt any.

Not the roar you expect from the sea. This was smaller, meaner. The sound a tap makes when you didn‚Äôt turn it off quite enough. I hunted it with a torch, ear to pipes, hand to walls, following that thin silver noise down into the service level where the stone smells like damp metal and mould. Dry. Everything was dry. But the sound threaded the night all the same, just at the edge of thought, like a song you hate stuck behind your teeth.

I wrote it off as the wind working some loose sash. I logged it as if naming a thing makes it behave.  
*22:10 Dripping noise. Source unclear.*

I was raised to be practical, to rely on myself. My father taught me to check the obvious thing first‚Äîif a car won‚Äôt start, jiggle the battery lead before you condemn the alternator. After the marriage ended, after I stopped answering messages that opened with *Hey, stranger*, I started to measure my days in things I could fix. The light is good for that. If it doesn‚Äôt turn, you wind. If it burns too low, you trim. If the horn fails, you pull the choke and try again until the note opens over the water like a door.

Sometimes, between horn blasts, something like quiet falls. You hear the tower settling, your blood in your ears, the sea rearranging stones below. Sometimes, if you let yourself, you can almost believe the fog is just weather. That it isn‚Äôt watching back.

On the seventh night, it came in thick. I tasted it on the stairs before I saw it. The air went soft and damp; my arms sugar-coated with salt. The lantern room fogged from the outside like a breath on glass. The beam pushed through and carved a tunnel of light in the murk, everything beyond erased. The horn note wobbled, then steadied, like a throat clearing.

I don‚Äôt scare easy. Not bragging. You can teach fear to stand in the corner if you give it enough chores. But there‚Äôs a kind of wrong that doesn‚Äôt arrive with bangs and screams. It pads in, makes itself at home in the part of your brain that keeps lists. It makes you doubt your own edges.

Close to midnight, I was standing with my knuckles on the rail, watching the beam make its slow sweep, when I felt it, a change in the room that wasn‚Äôt temperature or sound. A prickle at the nape, an itch in my teeth, that childhood sense that someone just said your name in a room you haven‚Äôt entered yet.

The light slid across the fog and for a heartbeat the world sharpened like a knife on a whetstone. The tunnel showed nothing but vapour and white noise, particles racing like snow in a torch beam.

The light moved on. The room exhaled. My shoulders loosened without permission.

And somewhere below me, out on the gallery in that thick white, something tapped against the metal rail, sharp and deliberate.

Not a bang. Not the jump-scare I probably deserved. Four neat taps, patient as a metronome.

I told myself it was grit or pebbles, maybe kicked up by the wind and flung against the rail from below. A stretch, but easier than admitting what it sounded like. I wrote none of it in the log.

Instead I wrote the tasks, small anchors against larger weather:  
*Cleaned prisms.*  
*Checked bulb housing and backup wiring.*  
*Horn 00:00, 00:30.*  
*Fog persistent.*

When you‚Äôre alone long enough, your thoughts have your back, They say sensible things, sometimes... They keep their hands in their pockets. That night they were unusually kind to me. *It‚Äôs rocks,* they said. *It‚Äôs wind. It‚Äôs the tower stretching its bones. Nothing to do with you.*

I made another circuit of the stairs, palm leading the way, the rail slick and honest under my skin. Back in the watch room I tried sleep, the padding giving me no relief from the thin mattress ridge digging into my spine. I listened for the drip that had by now become by lullaby and found none. so I lay there, awake. The horn beat the hours like a slow heart and The beam kept time on the walls.

I told myself I‚Äôd check the lantern glazing in the morning. I told myself there was no ‚Äúbelow me,‚Äù really, only air the black percussion of the sea. I told myself anything that might make the skin on my arms lie down.

But the next pass of the light brought the same electric feeling along the back of my neck.

And the pass after that brought the taps again, metallic, rattling up through the rail into my hands. Four, exactly. Four, exactly, like an answer.

I didn‚Äôt touch the logbook after that.

I stood with the beam at my shoulder, the horn rattling my ribs, the taste of brass in my mouth. Very quietly, I counted my breathing until dawn made a weak suggestion at the window.

The fog didn‚Äôt lift.  
It just pretended to be thinner where morning could see it.

When I finally unlatched the door and stepped out onto the gallery, water beaded on my eyelashes and salt stung a cut I don‚Äôt remember earning. Down below, the rocks were greased black, kelp combed flat by the tide. The rail where the tapping had sounded was empty, slick with damp, wearing nothing but a skin of condensation and a dusting of salt, the way it always does.

I told myself a new lie: that sleep, and only sleep, would fix this.

That night, the foghorn felt heavier in my hands. The note went out over the water like a hand laid on a shoulder. And for the first time, when it died away, I listened not for silence

but for an answer.

By the second week, I‚Äôd stopped marking the days properly. The logbook was supposed to keep me straight, but the handwriting had already started to slip, neat rows turning into jagged scrawls. I‚Äôd catch myself writing the wrong hour, or repeating the same line twice as if time had folded in on itself.

I tried to blame it on sleep, but the truth is I wasn‚Äôt sleeping. Not really. I‚Äôd shut my eyes and hear that rattle on the rail, feel the vibration in my bones, wait for it to come again. Sometimes it did. Sometimes it didn‚Äôt. Which was worse.

¬†I thought I saw something stranger than fog one early afternoon. A white bird on the gallery rail. Too bright against the mist, out of place. It tilted its head at me, sharp and knowing, It was the most unusual crow id ever seen, I tried to creep closer to get a better view but it slipped back into the fog as if it had never been there. I told myself it was exhaustion, but I kept waiting for it to come back.

The fog never left. It thickened and thinned, like a lung drawing breath, but it never let go of the tower. During the day it was a dull white sheet, the sea and sky erased. At night it pressed close, blackening at the edges of the lamp‚Äôs tunnel, and I swear it pulsed with the horn like a thing alive.

I started keeping a second notebook, hidden under the cot. Not the official log, just scribbles of things I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to record in neat ink in fear of being branded crazy:

*Tap. Four times. 02:15.*  
*Heard footsteps on gallery. Checked. Empty.*  
*Foghorn vibrated before I touched the choke.*  
*Something whispered back?.*

That last one I tried to cross out so hard the paper tore.

The strangest part? I still did the work. Bulbs checked, glass cleaned, gears wound. I still boiled the kettle, still counted steps, still rationed my biscuits like a kid saving sweets. But the edges of my world had started to blur. Sometimes I‚Äôd walk the stairs and find myself at the wrong level, unsure if I‚Äôd gone up or down. Sometimes I‚Äôd catch a reflection in the lantern glass and think there was someone else in the room.

On the ninth night, I saw them.

Not clearly, not the way I wanted. Just a smear of shape in the beam‚Äôs sweep. But it wasn‚Äôt a gull, or spray, or a shadow. It was taller, straighter. A human outline standing where no footing should exist, just fog and air and the drop to the rocks. By the time the beam came round again, it was gone.

I didn‚Äôt log it. I barely trusted myself to think it.

The next night, there were three.

They stood at different heights out in the fog, far enough from the tower to make no sense, but close enough to see. Perfectly still. Perfectly wrong. My stomach turned like I was in freefall, but I couldn‚Äôt move. I gripped the brass rail until my hands went white. When the beam passed again, they‚Äôd shifted, i couldn't be certain but I'm sure it was a fraction nearer.

I nearly choked myself on the foghorn cord trying to get the sound out fast enough. I prayed the monstrous noise would create sound waves powerful enough to disturb the uncanny patterns made by the fog and light.

the note roared into the dark, shaking the tower. For a moment I felt relief.¬†

Until all three figures lifted their heads at once, like the sound was calling them home.

I didn‚Äôt sleep after that. Couldn‚Äôt. Every sweep of the light brought them back. Every blast of the horn seemed to tighten whatever tether was pulling them in. I sat with my back to the wall, mug of coffee clutched like a weapon, whispering bargains to myself.

*If they reach the glass, I‚Äôll run. If they step onto the gallery, I‚Äôll jump. If they make a sound, I‚Äôll‚Ä¶*

I never finished that one.

By dawn they were gone. Through the night they seemed to shift a little closer with each pass of the lantern, never reaching the tower but always shrinking the distance. As the sun crept back into existence they thinned and faded with the fog.

And in their place, on the rail where they had been staring all night, the white crow perched again. Too bright against the dim dawn, it tilted its head, watching me in silence before vanishing back into the fog‚Äîas if it had been bearing witness the entire time.

By the third week, I‚Äôd stopped pretending this was routine. The tower ran on its own rhythm, light turning, horn groaning, gears ticking, but I was the one falling out of sync. My hands shook even when they weren‚Äôt on the rail. My coffee tasted like brine. My own reflection in the lantern glass startled me more than once.

The second notebook grew messy. Sentences trailed into nonsense, words scrawled at angles I didn‚Äôt remember writing. Pages smeared where my hand had sweated through the ink. One night I woke with the pen still in my fist, a line etched over and over until it carved the paper:

*They are closer.*

The fog pressed tighter, damp clinging in my clothes. The whole tower felt smaller. I paced the stairs to keep myself awake, but more than once I reached a landing and couldn‚Äôt tell if I was climbing up or down. Once I circled and circled, breath ragged, until I realised I‚Äôd been walking past the same window slit for nearly half an hour. When I leaned out to check, there was nothing but blank fog. Nothing, except the faint scrape of something against the stone.

I stopped opening the logbook. What was the point of writing *bulb checked* or *gear wound* when the real notes were carved into my bones?

The figures returned night after night. Each time the sun fell, they were back in the fog, always starting from the same impossible distance as if rewound by dawn, and each sweep of the lamp drew them forward again.

The figures were no longer just outlines. On the twelfth night, the beam caught the pale suggestion of faces‚Äîblurred, waterlogged, but watching. Their posture was wrong: heads too still, bodies leaning just enough to look like they were falling without ever touching the ground. Each sweep stole another fraction of the distance. I swore I saw breath pluming in the cold when the light brushed them.

The horn betrayed me worst of all. I pulled the cord, and instead of repelling, the vibration came first, shivering through the rail, crawling up into my chest, then they shifted. All of them, as one. Like the horn had given them permission.

I stopped blasting it, but the silence was worse. I could feel them waiting for it, like dogs starved for a whistle.

That was the night the white crow came back. Not at dawn this time, but deep in the hours before morning. I found it sitting on the gallery rail, feathers glowing faint against the lamp‚Äôs beam. It didn‚Äôt caw. Didn‚Äôt move. Just tilted its head at me, eyes dark as the fog behind it. For a second I thought if I leaned close enough, it would speak.

I don‚Äôt know why, but I whispered to it. Asked it what they wanted. Asked it if it was here for me. Asked it if I was supposed to keep the light burning, or let it die.

The crow blinked, once. And then the fog swallowed it.

By dawn, the figures had retreated again. The white crow returned with the morning too, perching on the rail like it owned the place. I‚Äôd started leaving scraps of bread for it, offerings, maybe. I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was an omen or a protector, but since the figures hadn‚Äôt stepped onto the gallery itself, I let myself believe it was keeping them back. Hoping it was.

But even after dawn the rail seemed to hum faintly, like it had held onto something that wasn‚Äôt mine. Not the horn this time, something else. I couldn‚Äôt shake the sense the tower itself was carrying their presence forward, holding a trace of them that would only end once they were inside with me.

By the fourth week, the tower didn‚Äôt feel like mine anymore. It felt borrowed, or worse, shared. The air inside was never still. The walls had a pulse I could feel through my palms when I leaned against them. I‚Äôd wake choking on panic, certain something was in the room with me, a terror that makes you bite down on your own fist to keep quiet. My thoughts whispered that there was no need for silence, that I was alone. But the dread clawing at my chest told me better: I was far from alone.

I stopped pretending the figures came and went. They reset, yes, but the rail still thrummed each morning like it had carried something up from the fog. I knew they hadn‚Äôt left at all. They were simply waiting for the chance to start again. Every dawn felt like a reprieve I hadn‚Äôt earned.

There was no question of leaving. The tower sits on a rock cut off from the mainland, the supply boat long overdue, the cliff path drowned under fog. I tried the radio more than once, but the harbourmaster‚Äôs voice never sounded surprised. Almost like he already knew what circled the lighthouse. Every call ended the same way, him telling me to keep the lamp turning, then cutting the line. That‚Äôs when the fear deepened: if he knew, and still left me here, then what chance did I have? I thought about the coats I‚Äôd found on my first day, hanging forgotten in the watch room. Too many for one keeper. I‚Äôd wondered then why they were left behind. Now I think I know. I imagine their owners running down these same stairs, pressing the same rail, whispering the same promises to themselves until the night took them too.

The white crow came every dawn without fail, black eyes fixed on me while I placed bread on the rail. The first time it ate, I thought I imagined it. The second time, I watched crumbs tumble from its beak and scatter into the mist. I didn‚Äôt know if I was bribing a guardian or feeding a harbinger, but either way I couldn‚Äôt stop. The ritual mattered now. If I kept the crow fed, maybe it kept the gallery safe. Maybe.

But safe didn‚Äôt last.

On the fifteenth night, I heard them *through* the stairs. Not outside, not in the fog, inside the tower‚Äôs bones, as if the sound was being carried up the iron itself. My throat closed. My torch beam shook so hard I could hardly keep the light steady on the steps. Every instinct screamed at me to run, but where to? Down into the dark? Up into the lantern room with nowhere to hide? The air was damp and sour in my mouth. Nothing there. Nothing but the faint echo of weight where no one should be. I pressed my ear to the rail and the vibration that came back wasn‚Äôt the steady thrum of machinery. It was a rhythm. Four steps. A pause. Four steps again.

I ran the rest of the way down, heart punching against my ribs, half expecting to feel a hand close on my shoulder. Every time I stopped to listen, silence filled the gap. But when I touched the rail‚Äîalways the rail, it carried the memory of footsteps that weren‚Äôt mine. A memory you can‚Äôt scrub out.

The crow didn‚Äôt appear that dawn. I left the bread anyway, hands shaking so badly I nearly dropped it. The thought of losing even that thin comfort made my stomach hollow with dread.

On the seventeenth night, the figures were so close I could see the glisten of water running from their hair. They leaned against the fog as if it were glass, pressing toward the tower. When the beam cut across them, their heads lifted in perfect unison. Not fast. Not jerky. Just a slow tilt, like they‚Äôd been waiting for me to look. My teeth ached from clenching, my breath tearing at my throat.

The silence between horn blasts felt like held breath. Mine, or theirs, I couldn‚Äôt tell. I kept thinking‚Äîif I breathe too loud, they‚Äôll hear.

By the twentieth night, I stopped writing completely. The notebooks sat in the watch room drawer, pages curling from damp. All I had left were muttered promises to myself. *Stay awake. Keep the light moving. Feed the crow. Don‚Äôt let the rail go quiet.*

Because when the rail finally goes still, I think it will mean they‚Äôve stepped inside.

¬†By the fifth week, I was barely human. My body ran on seconds of sleep stolen at the desk, head snapping up at the smallest creak. I tried everything, piling coats against the door, wedging tools through the handles, even dragging the cot across the floor as if flimsy metal could stop what moved in the fog. None of it helped. The tower was never mine, never safe.

Nights had become something I dreaded with a sick, sinking weight in my chest. I would sit staring at the lamp, wondering what would happen if I simply let it go dark. If I killed the beam, the figures might lose their path‚Äîbut ships out at sea would lose theirs too. How many sailors would wreck against these rocks if I chose myself over them? The thought made me sick, but the temptation stayed.

The tower itself felt like a trap. Every wall pressed inward, every stair twisted tighter. I barely recognised my own voice when I muttered to myself, raw and rasping from nights without rest. Coffee did nothing. Fear had chewed straight through the caffeine, leaving me wired and hollow.

The figures no longer waited in the fog; they had crept beyond their usual stopping point. They pressed right to the edge of the gallery, only a sweep of the lamp between us. When the beam moved on, they shifted forward, bodies leaning into the metal rail as if testing it, weight dragging against the iron. Their outlines were warped by the fog, faces pale and waterlogged, hair plastered against skulls, clothes hanging in strips that fluttered without wind. Their eyes glistened too dark, too steady, fixed on me no matter how the beam moved. And worse, I recognised them. The pale features, the soaked uniforms, the warped faces were the same as the staff photos still hanging in the watch room, men and women who should have been long gone. Now they stood outside, dripping and silent, staring in. I could hear the scrape now, groaning as if the rail itself might give way.

On the final sweep of the lamp before dawn, I saw them on the gallery itself, right outside the window. One had its hand pressed flat against the glass, water trailing down its fingers, while another hovered inches from the door handle. I pressed myself against the far wall, too terrified to move, lungs locked tight as if even breathing might draw them in. Every time the light passed, they froze again, mannequins posed by a cruel hand. And every time it moved on, they edged closer.

The crow came later that morning,, I left bread with shaking fingers, whispering bargains I barely understood. Protect me. Keep them off the gallery. Don‚Äôt let them in. The bird never answered, only watching with that tilted head, feathers glowing too bright against the grey.

The harbourmaster stopped answering my calls. Just static now, hissing in my ear. Sometimes I thought I heard voices under it, muffled and distant, like others calling from the fog. I snapped the radio off and shoved it in the drawer with the notebooks. When I did, a loose scrap fluttered free, torn from a page not written in my hand. The handwriting was tight, frantic. *The sea needs to eat. The lighthouse is the plate. The foghorn is the dinner bell. These figures are‚Ä¶* The line ended jagged, ripped short. I stared at it until the words blurred. Better silence than that.

I know tonight is the night they‚Äôll get in. They want me to go with them, to feed the sea, or whatever waits inside it.

I have Two choices. Accept my fate and join the others, or kill the light and doom the sailors who trust me to keep them safe. The fog is thick and the cliffs are¬† unforgiving. Even a seasoned captain wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance without this beam.

The advert was honest about one thing: this job was only ever temporary.

but It won‚Äôt end with a contract. It ends with me.

I have felt foggy headed for I don‚Äôt even remember how long now but definitely during pregnancy so at least 1.5 years. It feels like I‚Äôve had a beer in terms of not being on top of things and things don‚Äôt feel connected. Like yesterday doesn‚Äôt exist anymore and I‚Äôm only right now. I don‚Äôt know how else to explain it. First I was told it was pregnancy brain. I saw some improvement with iron infusions during pregnancy. Then had the baby and it was just lack of sleep. Then had low vitamin D and they said it was that. They tested my thyroid and said it was fine so they said it was because I was breastfeeding. Then I had an MRI just in case but it was clear so it‚Äôs like they stopped caring. After quitting breastfeeding I still had the issues so I saw a natural doctor who said it was my low iron saturation (shown on blood work) and thyroid so I‚Äôve been on stuff for that for over a month now but now I‚Äôm having some dizzy spells. I spoke to my doctor the other day and she had nothing to offer for the brain fog though I did forget to tell her about the dizzy spells because I obviously have memory issues with the fog too. I‚Äôm very much over feeling this way. I feel lost and like I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore. I get serotonin syndrome from SSRIS in case anybody‚Äôs wondering why they haven‚Äôt tried to treat me for depression yet. I‚Äôm desperate for relief or at least an answer.

I see interviews with country-boy types who call Cracker Barrel a part of their culture and identity.  This just shows you how pathetic America's third places are, that so many people see Cracker Barrel as a type of third place and cultural icon.  It's a building that is meant to look like an old time country store with a wooden porch and rocking chairs, straight from Huckleberry Finn, and all you have to look at is a parking lot. 

I get it if you like the food, decor, and atmosphere of Cracker Barrel. I just think Americans need to take third places more seriously, and they need to closer resemble Europe's third places.  The places in the US like coffee shops and bars where people are meant to socialize are either very noisy or overlooking a parking lot, and they all usually require a car to get there.",8,1755995101.0,Suburbanhell,4,0.83,False

*Where the Odds Are as Clear as a Margarita on a Hot Afternoon*

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Misery and Glory**  
Let‚Äôs cut through the hype with some cold, hard numbers. The bookmakers are all over this like a blanket on a naptime toddler. Los Angeles FC (-0.5 to -0.75 goals on the spread) is the clear favorite, with implied win probabilities hovering around **56-59%** (thanks to those juicy -178 to -169 odds). FC Dallas? They‚Äôre the underdog, with a 20-22% chance to pull off an upset‚Äîabout the same odds as me correctly predicting your weekend plans. The draw? A 25-26% shot, which is statistically more likely than me finishing this article without a coffee refill.

The Over/Under is set at 2.5-2.75 goals, with the Over priced as low as **1.65** (implying a 60% chance of chaos). Given LAFC‚Äôs recent *mixed form* (win, draw, win? More like win, *pause for water*, win), and Dallas‚Äôs habit of finishing near the bottom of the MLS, expect a game where someone forgets to bring their A-game‚Äîand their shorts.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, or Why Your Team Sucks**  
Here‚Äôs the exciting part: *there are no major injuries reported*. Yes, you read that right. Zero! Not a sprained ankle, not a strained ego, not even a ‚Äústar player out due to existential crisis.‚Äù For FC Dallas, that‚Äôs either a miracle or a red flag. Are they healthy? Sure. Are they good? Let‚Äôs compare them to a group of accounting students trying to score a soccer ball. Healthy but hopeless.

LAFC, on the other hand, is dealing with the universal injury of *meh form*. Their recent draw against Austin FC? Imagine ordering a firework and getting a sparkler. Impressive,

Sometimes it's sensitive to where it feels annoying wearing a shirt as if the shirt is putting pressure that area.

Again, those are come and go. I'm thinking food is a triggering factor. However, 2 days ago, I started getting dull aches right under both of my ribs. I have been feeling full and the thought of food really isn't on my agenda until the end of the day.

1myhe1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/WFPBD/comments/1myhe1o/too_much_protein/,Too Much Protein?,"Long post warning.

How do you not consume too much protein as a percentage of your calories?  As far as I know, most countries nutrition/government recommendations are protein at about 15-17% of your total caloric intake.  I'm trying to shoot for about 15%protein, 10% fat (low fat due to following Mastering Diabetes program) and 2000 calories as a petite 100 pound female.  But more often I end up with 20-22% protein and 1500-1700 calories.  I'm trying to gain weight as I'm a bit underweight, and I know 1500 calories just isn't cutting it.  However, aside from fruit, it seems EVERYTHING has protein in it- nearly all grains, vegetables, and of course beans.  I usually get to 80 grams of protein easily with what I eat... and if I do the typical 0.8-1 gram protein per kg of body weight, I should only need about 45 grams per day?? I know that's the RDA for avoiding deficiency, but still, 50-60 grams per day should be adequate I would think?  Additionally, I do have some past kidney damage, and that's another reason I want to not go overboard on protein.

What I typically consume in a day:

Breakfast is a serving of steel cut or rolled oats, a teaspoon of flaxmeal or chia seeds, half a cup of broccoli, and a handful of blueberries or strawberries, coffee with oatmilk.

Snack is a mandarin orange and a cup of cooked kale.

Lunch is a serving of cooked farro / brown rice / bulgur over lettuce with a cup of cooked boccoli or cauliflower, a banana, and a piece of ezekiel bread toasted with peanut butter.

Snack is a cup of blackberries, and a decaf oatmilk latte.

Dinner is a cup of cooked bok choy, cooked carrots, peas, a 1/2-3/4 cup of beans, a half serving of fruit, and another serving of whole grain OR a peanut butter sandwich on ezekiel bread.

That's easily about 80 grams of protein, and I'm not sure how I would possibly get the needed calories by replacing beans or whole grains with more vegetables or fruits, they're just not calorie-dense enough.

I'll attach a photo of one day of my cronometer readings.  I've heard mixed things on plant based protein not being as readily available (and so I shouldn't worry about consuming more protein than recommended) versus it being just as bioavailable and ""quality"" as animal protein.  Thoughts?  Any ideas on how to get more calories in me while keeping my protein intake down?

Jozef huffed and puffed as he sprinted towards the finish line. His partially disassembled teammate might have lightened the load a little bit for him, but he was still exhausted from the physical exertion. Still, it didn‚Äôt matter‚Äîthey were almost at the end! The chaos of the crashing ships was mostly behind them at this point, and better yet, so were the other racers! In fact, it had been quite some time since he had seen anybody, including that pair from earlier.

‚ÄúHey, Raph!‚Äù he said, turning his head back over his shoulder now that their victory was almost assured to check in with his partner. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on back there? Where is everyone else?‚Äù However, as he turned, his eyes did not fall upon his opponents far in the distance, but rather the disembodied head of his friend, a desperate look in her eyes as she scuttled towards him atop one of her hands.

‚ÄúLook out! Above us!‚Äù she shouted. Just then, Jozef felt a shadow pass over him. He looked up, and soaring over his head he saw his two rivals riding some sort of glider. He didn‚Äôt even have the chance to curse. As soon as he saw them, Jozef broke into a last, desperate sprint to the finish line, burning the last of his stamina to do everything he could to reach it first, but to no avail. He could do nothing but watch as Rob and Henry descended to the ground, crossing the finish line a few yards ahead of him and landing safely thanks to their spring legs.

‚ÄúHaha, hell yeah!‚Äù Henry gloated, reveling in his victory while offering his partner a high five. ‚ÄúNice work, Rob.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, we did good,‚Äù Rob began, looking down at his altered legs, no free from the harness tying them to his partner, with a sickly expression. ‚ÄúHey, now that this is over, can you undo the spring legs, though? This is *really* gross.‚Äù Henry waved him off.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, in a second. Take out your Uropeh first. We were supposed to get some sort of hint from winning, right?‚Äù Henry said, taking out a small blue gem from his own pocket as Rob did the same. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what those other guys were saying, at least.‚Äù Henry and Rob held the small crystals in their hands for a moment, silently staring at them in anticipation of‚Ä¶ something.

‚ÄúSo do we need to *do* something, or is it just a wait and‚Äî‚Äù Rob‚Äôs words were cut off as the two Uropeh suddenly unleashed another blinding, blue light.

A second later, the two opened their eyes and found the area around them transformed once again. No longer were they standing in the park, but were instead at the base of a massive, stone structure resembling some sort of temple. The massive building before them was clearly ancient, crumbling and worn down by time, but was nonetheless awe inspiring. The strange apparition seemed to shimmer in the sunlight, as nearly every inch of the temple was adorned and embellished, almost garishly, by designs created by thousands of Uropeh. Then, from seemingly nowhere, a figure appeared before them. The King.

‚ÄúMy kingdom‚Ä¶ My home‚Ä¶ Where‚Ä¶?‚Äù he wheezed mournfully, then was gone, along with the vision of the ruins, and even the crashed ships from before. The only thing left behind were the destruction they had caused in the park, and of course, Henry and Rob together at the finish line, standing victorious, but dumbfounded.

**Scenario: ??? ‚Äî ???**

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad our research into the [zombis](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1mpl8vl/) paid off, De Selby,‚Äù Halima spoke, sipping from their cup of tea as the two sat in the captain‚Äôs quarters of the Engineer‚Äôs personal ship. ‚ÄúWho knew it would be easy to fabricate ghostly material, after all.‚Äù

**‚Äú‚ÄôTwas always so easy, I knew, I must confess. You simply needed to feel it to be true‚Ä¶ and it was to be.‚Äù I said, swirling a teacup in my hand. It seemed at once to exist and to cease to be, flickering in and out of physical space. I take a sip, tasting the flavor of once was but now ceases to be.**

**‚ÄúThe King, it seems, is much the same. A resonance to places of great history, of great emotion. And so, a ghost. Something that is as it once was. An entity that persists through raw emotional energy alone.‚Äù I dropped the teacup on the floor, it clattered unharmed. It shattered. It was empty, spilling no liquid. It left an awful mess. ‚ÄúBelieve in it or not, it is the idea of something that has weight, and so it shall. The King shall feel it and spring forth, and I shall take audience.‚Äù**  

‚ÄúFascinating‚Ä¶I suppose this means the next stage of your plan will go swimmingly?‚Äù

**‚ÄúOur plan, dear Halima. This machine would not run as so without each one of us acting as cogs‚Ä¶‚Äù I said valiantly**

**‚ÄúThe final piece is nearly in place. This shall be the stage for my ‚ÄòOpening Performance‚Äô, or it shall be the stage of my ‚ÄòGrand Finale‚Äô. Now, we need only the actors to take their places‚Ä¶ and I see, yet strangely obscured, that I have one more part to play to get them there.‚Äù**

**Scenario: *The Leatherback Rebel* ‚Äî 9:23 AM**

*Tsch.* Marion sucked her teeth, her hat tipped down and obscuring her eyes from the camera in front of her. Her chair teetered on its back legs as she pushed her leg up against the table. s
She sat alongside Jozef, Ryder and Avery in a video call with the head of the Field Division of the Speedwagon Foundation. Not long into the call, she already knew she was going to need a stiff drink.

When they got the order that they weren‚Äôt to interfere with the Fortunate Sons, Marion and Jozef reached out to the highest figure they personally knew at SPW‚Äîan agent of a similar age to her, who had helped her with several of her problems in her first few months, and the latest of Jozef‚Äôs fencing instructors. 

‚ÄúThis is bullshit!‚Äù Avery cried out, Jozef covering his ear. ‚ÄúWhy are the Sons getting all the preferential treatment while we‚Äôre left in the dust?‚Äù

The figure at the other end of the call sighed, unclasping a burgundy cloak and laying it offscreen, leaving just a black turtleneck on to accent his tired navy eyes. Marion had hoped that Raymond Shimizu would have overturned that decision. After all, if they could get information on the ghostly king that has been appearing then it would be a great opportunity for research. Unfortunately‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou should be asking the board of directors about that,‚Äù he responded, taking a large chug of coffee out of the mug on his desk. ‚ÄúThey value the results that the Fortunate Sons bring. Their means are not of any concern.‚Äù

His Stand ‚Äî a pale white humanoid, almost angelic, covered with intricate silver markings and with piercing red eyes ‚Äî floated into frame. ‚ÄúWe tried to discuss it already: they made it very clear that they‚Äôd fire us if we pushed it further!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell they can‚Äôt exactly fire me,‚Äù Ryder chuckled dryly. ‚ÄúI personally don‚Äôt even work for Speedwagon, I should be able to butt heads with the Sons with no issue.‚Äù

Raymond‚Äôs frown twinged. ‚ÄúYou might not be, but your team is a joint operation‚Äîit‚Äôll still be seen as you going against orders.‚Äù

Avery shook his head. ‚ÄúThen we break the orders‚Äîwe go up to them and face them head on and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù That train of thought was immediately cut off by Ray. ‚ÄúOut of the question, you can‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? I‚Äôve heard you‚Äôve been happy to ignore orders yourself if they‚Äôre as bullshit as these‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄîPlease. Don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt protect you if you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd? At least that foul crew would be out of the way! Why are you being so adamant about thi‚Äî‚Äù


‚ÄúThere will be **HELL** to pay if you defy these orders, and the Sons will take it in **FULL**. It would be **GREATLY** to your benefit if you drop this issue **NOW.** Please‚Ä¶‚Äù 

The three agents were stunned silent‚Äîone thing that was known by almost all of Speedwagon is how calm their latest head of the Field Division was, so to see him snap and his composure break was a complete shock.

He sighed, leaning back on his chair as took several deep breaths while his Stand swapped his coffee with a cup of lavender tea. ‚ÄúThank you, Petyr...so, I should explain. You aren‚Äôt the first agents to have tried to fight them. Agents with more experience than many of you‚Ä¶I‚Äôve read through each and every one of their files‚Äînone of them made it. None of them managed to land more than a couple of strikes. I‚Äôm not telling you to stay out of their way because I *want* them around‚Ä¶I‚Äôm telling you because just rushing after them is suicide, and I can‚Äôt let that happen. I don‚Äôt think I could forgive myself if I did.‚Äù

The call went silent, both sides recovering. Jozef lowered his gaze, leaning on the back wall of the room as he processed the conversation so far. ‚Äú...So that‚Äôs it then? None of us can do anything about them?‚Äù

Ryder grumbled. ‚ÄúI doubt they could beat me‚Ä¶‚Äù

Marion took a deep breath before she kicked up from her chair and began pacing around the room, a terrible medley of rage and frustration brewing in her gut. While she kept it buried beneath the surface, this whole business with the Fortunate Sons infuriated her: Sturdy Steady Go had watched the [cooking contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1mm43q3/) one of them had taken part in, saw the kind of person he was and hated him‚Äîeven more so with what she knew now. Those who abuse their power to take advantage of others were those she could not stand: and now to know that the heads of the organisation she was a part of were letting them get away with it? She took a deep breath, and her rage subsided as in its place came a burning resolve.

‚Äú...there is‚Ä¶something,‚Äù Raymond spoke up. ‚ÄúThe Fortunate Sons have given us the area of their next operation‚Äîsome of the agents have dubbed it a ‚Äòno-go zone‚Äô, a marsh in Puerto Rico. The thing is, several shipments have been made from the Foundation to that zone since it was set up. It may be worth it to have one of you take a look at it, got a few allies in the area who could help sneak you in.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust one? Surely a few more wouldn‚Äôt hurt‚Ä¶‚Äù Ryder noted, resting his head on his hand. ‚ÄúUnless you think too many would bring too much attention.‚Äù

Raymond nodded, his Stand floating back in frame. ‚ÄúYup!‚Äù Petyr continued on from where Ray had left. ‚ÄúAnd while this is something you‚Äôd be great at, it needs to be a Speedwagon agent so that they‚Äôd get through with little problem.‚Äù


Jozef and Avery looked at each other, then over to the video call. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna recommend either of us, are you?‚Äù Avery sighed.

‚ÄúCorrect‚ÄîAvery, I‚Äôll be blunt but you‚Äôre too new for this kind of mission, off the books or not. And Jozef, I promised your father that you‚Äôd be safe so I cannot in good faith send you‚Ä¶Marion. Are you up to the task?‚Äù

She nodded, finally tipping her hat up to look straight into the camera ‚Äîof course she was. There was an unspoken determination in her eyes. She knew Raymond knew the answer to that question before he even asked.

‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù Petyr cheered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll send over the information shortly. I‚Äôd recommend just you read it, but I wouldn‚Äôt blame the others for taking a peek.‚Äù

Marion gave Ryder a look, who sighed. ‚ÄúI suppose we‚Äôll leave this in your capable hands.‚Äù He spoke, nudging both Avery and Jozef before leading the two out of the room. The meeting was by all means finished anyways, all that was left was the transfer of files.

Before Raymond could turn off the video call, Marion asked a short, simple question which made him pause: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

He sighed, looking Marion in the eye. ‚ÄúBecause, Marion, you seem to have found yourself at the center of a large spike of *gravity*. 10 or more groups, each vying against each other for one reason or another‚Ä¶while no-one has defeated the Fortunate Sons in the past, their fates keeping them alive and intact‚Ä¶Fate may be making an opening. Just be careful.‚Äù

**Scenario: The No-Go Zone, Puerto Rico ‚Äî 11:15 AM**

A lone boat travelled across the river, the letters of SPW branded across the side and on the crates it was carrying. The agent in the back of the boat took a deep breath: they didn‚Äôt like not knowing exactly what they were carrying or who to, or why this assignment asked only for non-Stand users, but it would be best to just get this over with.

Unbeknownst to them, the boat was being followed‚Äîskeletal fins poked out of the water, as the Stand they were attached to swam up behind the boat. As it caught up it leaped into the metal hull, swimming through that and up onto the deck behind the agent: they felt an odd pull dragging them to the side of the boat, not noticing the spike that was launched into their back.

‚ÄúHey, I think someone‚Äôs here,‚Äù they called, bracing themselves against the side of the boat as they prepared themself to check over the edge‚Äî

Suddenly, the pull subsided: slowly, carefully, the agent peered over the side of the boat‚Ä¶finding nothing.

Suddenly, the handle of a sledgehammer tapped against their shoulder. The agent turned around to see the boat had been boarded: two people tying up the captain of the boat, the other right on top of them.

‚ÄúSorry about this,‚Äù Sara smiled, pressing her Stand against the agent‚Äôs chest. ‚ÄúBut this is a robbery.‚Äù

Soon, the Ghost Riders of the Sea had searched through every part of the ship, confirming they had captured both members of the crew and had secured the cargo‚ÄîSara and Azumi opened the crate, revealing the shimmering sapphire sight of hundreds of Uropeh. This was the third boat the crew had jumped, the third that was carrying exclusively the gemstone‚Äîand of course the third cargo they took for themselves, knocking the agents out and moving the boat back along the waters.

‚ÄúAnother good haul!‚Äù Captain Mira laughed, scooping up a handful of Uropeh and letting them fall through her fingers back into the crate. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad we followed that lead we found‚ÄîI‚Äôm hoping the Fortunate Sons don‚Äôt learn about that information leak we found!‚Äù

‚ÄúSame here!‚Äù Sara cheered: she had been searching for ways to funnel her destructive urges, and while she could do with finding a method that can be done any time busting up the Fortunate Sons‚Äô work is certainly doing wonders‚Äîeven if she can‚Äôt really *destroy* much with their current plan. She certainly could see why pirates enjoyed their way of life.

From a perch that they used to watch for incoming ships, Azumi called out to the others. ‚ÄúAnother vessel on its way‚Äîa fishing vessel, single crate on the back and one guard. Is it worth it?‚Äù

Mira nodded. ‚ÄúOf course! The more we take from the Sons‚Äô hands, the better: let‚Äôs go get our fourth haul!‚Äù

The trio got into their positions: Mira keeping an eye on the situation, with her and Sara ready to swoop in once Azumi lured the agent on board to the other side of the ship. Once more, ÔΩ¢FishboneÔΩ£ swam up towards the man‚Äîsome guy who looked like he‚Äôd rather be in an office than out here, but nonetheless was watching with a keen eye. Two spines thudded into his back, pulling him over to the side of the ship. As Sara and Azumi started jumping over, however, Mira noticed the man holding something odd in his hand, realising what it meant too late:

‚ÄúEnemy Stand!‚Äù she called out as the man spun around, firing from a wooden gun a single rubberband towards Azumi‚Äîthrowing him back and tying him up as he fell into the water, his Stand there to catch him. Sara pulled out ÔΩ¢Who's Buying?ÔΩ£, swinging it towards the man before he fired a shot at her as well: tying her arms together and causing her swing to miss, smashing the crate and causing piles of salt to gush out. His next attack was countered by Mira, slamming the man to the ground and pinning his arm‚Äîonly for the salt to start swirling in the air, as the captain of the vessel stepped onto the deck with another agent behind him.

‚ÄúHow about you two leave Howard there alone, unless you want to be tasting saltwater for weeks?‚Äù The captain said, preparing to assault the two with tons of salt with just a movement.

‚ÄúLittle Pontoon, Ms. Tarkovskaya, watch out‚Äî‚Äù Howard tried to warn his allies of the sheer speed and power of his opponent, but the vampire captain started to get up off him as soon as he said Marion‚Äôs name.

Mira took a hard, long look at the agent‚Äôs face, combing through her memories. ‚ÄúTarkovskaya?...any relation to Ruslan Bogdanovich Tarkovsky? Though from the looks of things you remind me more of Ra√∫l Guti√©rrez‚Ä¶‚Äù

Marion cocked her head to the side‚Äîhow did this person know the names of both of her grandfathers‚Äô names? ‚Äú...what if I am?‚Äù

The vampire laughed. ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre certainly as stoic as Ruslan! Ah, that brings back memories‚Äîin fact, I think I might have been the reason those two first met? Though I certainly don‚Äôt miss the sting of Ra√∫l‚Äôs Hamon.‚Äù She looked over at Marion again. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶you‚Äôre grandparents were good people. From the look of things you‚Äôd say so about yourself as well?‚Äù She looked around at the scenario around them. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre certainly not here to help the Fortunate Sons, are you? Sneaking in to take a look at what those bastards are doing. Shame it wouldn‚Äôt have worked, but you certainly have hit something *really* important‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúCould have worked if you didn‚Äôt break our cargo,‚Äù Howard mumbled, having picked himself up while Mira was talking.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so dour,‚Äù Little Pontoon shrugged, letting go of the salt‚Äîit was clear that the fight had finished for now. ‚ÄúI got some more crates we could pour the salt into. It should work.‚Äù

Having snapped the rubberband over her arms, Sara crossed them. ‚ÄúNot unless you can turn that stuff into Uropeh it won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the sole cargo the ships have been carrying here.‚Äù

The infiltrators all turned to her, before Pontoon mumbed under his breath (‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù) Marion turned between Mira and Sara, huffing before stepping forward.

‚ÄúExplain.‚Äù

The vampire smiled, fangs glistening. ‚ÄúOf course‚Äîafter all, while you probably know Speedwagon are assisting the Fortunate Sons, do you really *know* who the Sons are? Ever since [the incident at the Panama Canal](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/1m3hysw/), shipments of Uropeh have been getting impounded left and right. Each one with a different reason, but all end up the same: the Uropeh getting seized by the government, or by Speedwagon agents in the area. Uropeh that is now all being funnelled here, into one spot‚Äîand right after that king started popping up from them. Of course, I don‚Äôt entirely care why they‚Äôre doing this, I just want to grab the loot‚Äîbut I imagine the why is something you‚Äôre looking into yourself? So, how about a deal: we help smuggle you in and watch what they‚Äôre doing, *if* you help us get the Uropeh they're using. I‚Äôd offer for us to do it all in your stead, but I have a feeling you want to be there regardless of the danger. So‚Ä¶does that sound like a fair deal?‚Äù

Sara took a glance at Marion, then back to her Captain. Why was she making this offer to someone she only just met? While the normal answer would be for the challenge, Sara saw a look in the captain‚Äôs eye she couldn‚Äôt figure out. Nonetheless, if the agent agreed she saw no issue in helping out‚Äînot only would it be her responsibility to, but maybe the mission would get a bit more *destructive*.

Marion paused, looking at the crew that she and Raymond had picked out. This was meant to be a solo mission, Howard and Little Pontoon there to smuggle her in and possibly to smuggle out (though they had some others on standby if things got rough)‚Äîhowever, it was clear they needed the supply of Uropeh‚Ä¶

She extended her hand: ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

---

**Scenario: In Memoriam ‚Äî Low Noon**

Marion blinked, and found herself surrounded by darkness, expanding beyond her sight. It was utterly,There seemed to be a ground beneath her, although she could not see. What caused this? Was this a trap, set by those pirates? An enemy Stand, lying in wait for them? She looked around, searching for the culprit.

**Thus, I stood before her.**

He came from nowhere. He wasn‚Äôt there, but now he was, as if he had always been. He appeared humanoid, but as if it took effort to hold that form together. He wore a grey jumpsuit with his name emblazoned on the breast. The fabric billowed in time with the smoke.

**‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have come here,‚Äù I said, disappointed. ‚ÄúYou certainly shouldn‚Äôt have accepted that deal, nor try to meddle in things that you do not comprehend. Look what a mess you‚Äôve made for yourself~‚Äù**

The agent took a deep breath and stood at the ready, fists clenched, watching as the figure pulled out of thin air a list, a collection of words and numbers ‚Äî **her ‚Äòstatline‚Äô, a somewhat crude summary of her being that I can inspect. I don my reading glasses and inspect carefully.**

**‚ÄúHow curious,‚Äù I state, reading through her physical stats. ‚ÄúZero Strength? You seem much more powerful than the essence of your spirit would imply‚Ä¶ Now, this is simply curious.""**

The sheet evaporating into thin air, De Selby smiled. **‚ÄúLet us hope you are more formidable than your spirit suggests, or else this is going to be-‚Äù**

*Koooohhhhhhhhhh*

A sharp, drawn out inhalation. A bright glow, a dazzling shimmer, cutting through the darkness like a knife. Marion‚Äôs fist slammed into De Selby‚Äôs face, shattering his glasses and sending him to the ground, where he disappeared in a puff of smoke.

**I slowly reformed, perhaps a bit taken aback by the *rudeness* of this sudden outburst, but unphased nonetheless.**

‚ÄúY‚Äôreally think‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what you are?‚Äù Marion muttered, dropping the cigar from her mouth, grinding it against the ground with her boot. The embers were quickly snuffed out. **The smoke became a part of me. Eternally, I grow. ‚ÄúI am De Selby. I am a void that you cannot comprehend. Do not put on airs, child, it does not suit you.‚Äù I said firmly**

**The very space around her became her enemy, smoke buffeting her like an almighty storm. Enough force to knock a mere human off their feet, sweep them away into nothing.**

Yet still Marion stood, steadfast in the tempest.

*Koooohhhhhh-*

Rhythmic breathing is the key. Steady now. She glowed with energy as she whipped out her flask of tequila, quickly taking a swig. It swirled around with the smoke in the air. Almost reminded her of whiskey.

**‚ÄúA last drink?‚Äù I chuckled. How crude of me, to make jokes as I am taking a life. ‚ÄúShall we make a toast?‚Äù**

Marion smirked, whipping the lighter out of her pocket. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù She lit it, breathing out into the flame. Golden fire and harpoons shot forward, meeting with the dark smoke in the air and vaporizing it with a bright light. 

**‚ÄúGah-!‚Äù**

De Selby let out a gasp of pain. **A gasp of SHOCK. Merely startled by this outburst, I quickly regained my composure, the winds dying down.**

Marion could see De Selby‚Äôs smoke lessening. She could swear she saw a crack of light in the darkness, De Selby pushed up against a wall that didn‚Äôt appear to be there. **But she was *MISTAKEN.***

‚ÄúLike I said‚Ä¶ I know what you are. Smoke‚Ä¶ and mirrors. That list of yours‚Ä¶ should‚Äôve checked what my ‚ÄòAstral‚Äô was. ÔΩ¢El Viero Y El MarÔΩ£...‚Äù

She pulled out her revolver, quickly popping the cylinder open to check her rounds. 6 shots.

*Kohhhhh-hhh‚Ä¶ hh‚Ä¶*

Breathe. Let the air flow in, and pull the energy out. As natural as the tides. Even a place such as this feels the pull of the moon.

She fired the revolver and blew out at the same time, the smoke from the air lingering in front of the barrel. Bright, shining bullets sprung through the smoke, more golden harpoons flying forward at De Selby. He managed to dodge a couple, but one flew straight through his torso, tearing his jumpsuit and leaving a wide hole in the smoke.

**It did not hurt, as I do not feel pain. A minor inconvenience, if anything.**

The harpoons once more found their mark behind De Selby, more cracks forming in the darkness. 

**This fascinated me as much as it‚Ä¶ angered me. This should not be possible. Unless‚Ä¶**

**‚ÄúAh, I see.‚Äù** De Selby said, looking down at the hole in his sternum. He drew from the smoke in the air to fill it, the light gleaming through the cracks becoming more clear. **‚ÄùHow troublesome. You‚Äôre right. I appear‚Ä¶ to have the wrong sheet.‚Äù**

While De Selby spoke, Marion lifted her revolver once more, firing a 4th shot at them. 

**I swiftly dodged out of the way, grabbing the harpoon out of the air. It‚Ä¶ burned? No, no. It did not. I chucked it back at her, impaling her and killing her instantly.**

Marion swiftly rolled out of the way of the harpoon, taking a couple more shots at De Selby. That was six shots, she was out.

**Well, it was worth a shot.**

De Selby dodged one of the shots, but the other went straight through his shoulder, pinning him to the ground.

**‚Äú*Pinning* me to the ground? I am a being of pure darkness! Please, tell me how it makes sense for me to be pinned!‚Äù I yelled indignantly.**

Slightly confused by who exactly De Selby was talking to, Marion sprinted over to where he was pinned. This was it, he was on the ropes. ‚ÄòPure Darkness‚Äô... What bullshit. This person could bleed and die like any other.
**She‚Ä¶ truly believes this. And so it shall be. Such dark determination‚Ä¶ It almost pains me that I now know what must happen next.**

*Kohhhhh‚Ä¶hhh‚Ä¶hh‚Ä¶*

Marion breathed in shakily. This was it, one last blow. Then she could get out of here and find out what the hell was going on. Despite what she had said, she still didn‚Äôt know what the hell this guy was. 

She didn‚Äôt need to know. She could find out after she got out of here. Standing over him where he was pinned, he seemed weakened, powerless. She clutched the harpoon stuck in his shoulder, filling it with a burst of hamon energy. It crackled.

**It‚Ä¶ Hurt. Oh, what a curious sensation! I could not help but let out a chuckle.**

*Kohhh‚Ä¶ hhh‚Ä¶ hhhhh‚Ä¶*

**‚ÄúSuch‚Ä¶ power‚Ä¶ yes, that was the key‚Ä¶ the whole time‚Ä¶ The rhythmic breathing of your Hamon‚Ä¶**

*hhhhhhhh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶*

**‚ÄúAnd your command‚Ä¶ over smoke‚Ä¶ such blinding light‚Ä¶ marvelous, indeed‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶ you failed to consider‚Ä¶ one thing‚Ä¶‚Äú**

*hhhhhhh‚Ä¶. Hhhh‚Ä¶. hhhh‚Ä¶?*

Marion‚Äôs eyes went wide, her grip loosening on the harpoon. Taking this opportunity, **I ripped the harpoon from my shoulder, bashing it into her sternum and sending her to the ground. Standing over her, I smiled. Not smug, not angry, but benevolent.**

**‚ÄúYou have been breathing *me* in the whole time.‚Äù**

Marion gripped at her throat, almost involuntarily. Her vision was narrowing. She tried to breathe, but could not.

**She was choking. Asphyxiation is a gruesome way to die. Every moment of it burns every fiber of your being. Her lungs beg desperately to be filled, but it shall not be.**

Marion stumbled forward, towards De Selby. Everything in her body was fighting her, the burning sensation in her lungs called for her to fall to her knees, to collapse to the ground. But she didn‚Äôt. She couldn‚Äôt. Not while he still stood.

De Selby‚Äôs eyes raised, almost appearing bemused. 

**She fought the course of nature. Like an antelope that runs, not knowing its entrails have already been spilled by the lion.**

She stood face to face with De Selby. Her hand reached out shakily, gripping it tight. She still believed. No matter what he spouts about being incomprehensible, about being a ‚Äòvoid‚Äô. He can be beaten. He can bleed. He can die. The air crackled with golden light.

**I patted her hand sympathetically. ‚ÄúLay down and accept it, my dear‚Ä¶ you are already dead.‚Äù**

Marion‚Äôs grip tightened. She looked at De Selby in his white, empty eyes. With the last of the air her lungs could muster, she spoke firmly. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm free.‚Äù

Unbeknownst to De Selby, something was coming from behind. A mighty hammer smashed through the darkness, filling the strange realm with the inescapable light of the sun.

---

**Scenario: The No-Go Zone, Puerto Rico ‚Äî High Noon**

De Selby rubbed his head, having taken a firm hit from Sara‚Äôs hammer. She breathed heavily, clutching it in her hands. Marion lay still on the floor.

**‚ÄúMy, my‚Ä¶ Your power is far more than I imagined, Ms. Sara‚Ä¶ You managed to break through into my world.‚Äù**

His smoke reformed from laying to standing in an instant, looking around. **‚ÄúNow where, pray tell, is your captain? I have business to attend to with her.‚Äù**

Sara steadily moved over to Marion, kneeling beside her. She looked up to De Selby defiantly. ‚ÄúHeh‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt you like to know~?‚Äù

She shook Marion‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, get up‚Ä¶  let‚Äôs beat the shit out of this guy and-‚Äù

Nothing. She shook Marion again. She was entirely limp. Her eyes were rolled into the back of her head. She wasn‚Äôt moving. She wasn‚Äôt breathing.

Sara stood once more, backing up, gasping slightly in disbelief. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ was too late‚Ä¶ oh my god, you really‚Ä¶‚Äù 

She clutched her hammer, her knuckles turning white. Her gaze met De Selby‚Äôs.

**‚ÄúI did her the favor of enlightening her. I looked into her soul and saw the truth. She was destined to die‚Ä¶ to have all her ‚ÄòStrength‚Äô leave her.‚Äù**

Sara screamed, running forward and swinging her hammer at De Selby without a word. It slammed into him, sending him flying once more.

**‚ÄúACK!‚Äù**

Despite De Selby‚Äôs typical speed and composure, Sara managed to hit him, and hit him hard. Her hammer met its mark without letting up, not a moment for him to steady himself. *Fine.* She thought. *I‚Äôll beat him myself.*

Meanwhile, in the mind of Marion, ferocity and conviction gave way to confusion.

Complete, and utter confusion.

It‚Äôs hard not to be confused when you see your own corpse lying on the ground. She remembered what she felt at the moment of her death. Her raw defiance, her fury at this unknowable and tricky asshole that tried to make a mockery of her. Even as she stared down at what should be the ultimate end, she felt no fear. She didn‚Äôt have time to feel fear‚Ä¶ it was as if sheer adrenaline rushed through her body‚Ä¶ but it wouldn‚Äôt respond to her. She saw the commotion in the distance. She tried to regain her composure, to rush into action‚Ä¶ but she was frozen. Staring at the ground. Her own lifeless eyes peering back.

She mustered the strength to kneel down. She wanted to‚Ä¶ close her eyes. She reached out her hand to pull the eyelids down. Her hand passed right through.

It was at that moment that Marion heard a loud *crash* against the ground near her. Landing right next to her was Sara, quickly recovering from a tumble delivered to her by De Selby. As she stood up, she saw Marion‚Äôs frozen figure, seated in front of‚Ä¶ herself. 

Sara sputtered out questions in her own surprise. ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶ what happened to you?! You‚Ä¶ I thought you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm dead.‚Äù Marion cut through the confusion and stood up slowly. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not gone. Not yet‚Ä¶‚Äù

As she stretched to her full height, the sun‚Äôs rays shined on her, radiating a holographic sheen. Sara stood with her, facing towards their opponent. De Selby stood in his full smoke-filled glory, smothering the light as it passed through him.

**‚ÄúThis day is full of fascinating new discoveries! How intriguing!‚Äù** De Selby said with genuine enthusiasm, looking Marion up and down. **‚ÄùMy, I could mistake you for the real thing‚Ä¶ If only you didn‚Äôt have that sickly light emanating from you.‚Äú**

Sara immediately responded, her indignance continuing to build. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt bother with a monologue. I know your type. You think that your words make you strong‚Ä¶ but I think we both know you‚Äôll lose this fight.‚Äù

Looking back and forth between the two, De Selby‚Äôs eyes widened. **‚ÄúOhhhhhhh‚Ä¶ Haha, I see! This is Match 17, not Match 20! This is not the main event, it is merely the preamble!‚Äù**

Marion shook with anger. Why couldn‚Äôt her murderer at least make a lick of goddamn sense?

He clapped his hands together, the smoke which made up his form now becoming unstable, forming into a cloud.

**‚ÄúThe wrong place, at the right time‚Ä¶ Ms. Garmoshka, I congratulate you on your enlightenment, truly! No need to thank me! Ms. Sara, I have business to attend to with your captain! No more dwelling in the past, time to face my future!‚Äù**

The cloud of smoke burst off, beginning to fly away over the water. In its trail, the ground beneath seemed to morph, twisting into something different. An overwhelming cloud of darkness seemed to roll in from all sides of the swamp, closing in on the area. 

Sara looked at the ghost, at the darkness, then towards De Selby. While this was *not* what she signed up for, she couldn‚Äôt let this guy go after her captain, especially after he just killed this woman. It was her responsibility now, and she was going to take it. ‚ÄúHey Marion, move!‚Äù She called out, running past her and after the Fortunate Son.

She didn‚Äôt need to repeat herself, as the new ghost was now floating right alongside her. Within her, Marion felt her own determination rising to the forefront‚Äîshe *had* to be the one to catch him.

Watching them try and catch up to him, De Selby chuckled. **‚ÄúVery well:‚Äù**

**‚ÄúOpen the Game!‚Äù**

**Location:** A surreal, nightmarish realm created by De Selby. The area [here](https://i.imgur.com/x19RrDA.jpeg) is an infinitely long, 24m wide and 7 meter high hallway, with each tile being 1.5x1.5m. Though the map is infinite in length, only a 36m long stretch of it (depicted in the map) is ‚Äòrendered‚Äô at any period of time, anything behind this play area being consumed by **‚ÄôBlack Air‚Äô** and anything ahead of it being a blurry, dreamlike zone of unrendered reality. More on this in Additional Information. 

The lefthand side resembles a dilapidated convenience store. The smooth floors are littered with toppled shelves, spilled drinks, and generally has a higher density of obstructions than the other side. It is also dark, with the only light in the store coming from a few cracked screens on televisions and registers. The ceiling is water damaged with many tiles having fallen out, and  Beyond that the store is a comfortable temperature and humidity and is well stocked with snacks, room temperature beverages, and anything else one could expect to find in your average convenience store. There are also a handful of electronics scattered throughout, both as store fixtures (broken lighting, POS systems, freezer units) and part of the stock (headphones, cameras, stereo speakers).

The right-hand side resembles a deserted, drought-stricken ranch. This area is littered with larger obstacles, like hay bales, barrels, dead trees and old fences, along with a few small broken down farm vehicles. This portion of the map is blazingly hot and arid, with temperatures in the mid 90s and nonexistent shade. The ground is rough and cracked, but much more free of debris and obstacles than the other side of the map. The only saving grace for the environment on this side of the map is clear visibility and adequate sunlight.

Behind the players looms a wall of **‚ÄôBlack Air‚Äô**, a vantablack miasma which consumes all it covers. While it is detailed more in Additional Information, consumption by this miasma results in swift RETIREMENT. At the start of the match **‚ÄôBlack Air‚Äô** extends 3 meters deep into the map.

**Goal:** *Run.* 

The nightmare ends when one is left standing. Escape by any means you see fit. 

**Additional Information:** The wall of **‚ÄôBlack Air‚Äô** constantly surges forward, consuming all it crashes over. After a 10 second ‚Äòsafe period‚Äô it will begin to move forward at a consistent E spd, accelerating up by one speed tier every 30 seconds afterwards. Therefore at 40 seconds it will reach D spd, 1 minute 10 seconds it reaches C, 1 min 40 it reaches B, and at 2 minutes 10 seconds it will reach A SPD, at which point it caps off. From here, if the match is somehow still going, the area the **‚ÄôBlack Air‚Äô** covers will begin to increase by 1.5m every 10 seconds until the safe area of the map is completely covered, ensuring there is a hard limit to how long this match has before its conclusion. 

After the ‚Äòsafe period‚Äô the **‚ÄôBlack Air‚Äô** will become active and start to move forward, consuming the map as it does. From this point on falling into **‚ÄòBlack Air‚Äô** will begin to asphyxiate players through unknown means, with all the downsides of choking one might expect. After 5 unbroken seconds of asphyxiation within the **‚ÄôBlack Air‚Äô** cloud the miasma will fully consume a target, RETIRING them and bringing the match to an end. 

As **‚ÄôBlack Air‚Äô** moves it consumes and destroys terrain, more terrain rendering ahead at a rate that ensures there is constantly a 24x36m zone of accessible map for the match to take place upon. Trying to leave this 24x36m zone on either end will result in characters getting turned around by intangible force, effectively limiting their ability to leave the map or get too far ahead.

The other week I was in the bathroom brushing my hair. It was early morning the sun was coming through the window I was watching dandruff (white particles) falling from my head..

The STRANGE thing was they were leaving a black tail/shadow as they were falling maybe 1-2cm long, just the same as a plane leaves the white trace behind.. If 20 particles were falling od see 20 black streaks and obviously the bigger the particles the bigger wider the streaks..

It was when I was looking from above, like they were breaking through something that was automatically sealing after the particles move past. eg: if you were to move a toothpick through the white froth on a coffee you'd see the black coffee underneath for a split second then the froth would cover it over again..

Can any please explain this, I've never seen anything like it before, or could find anything on the web that would explain this? Or maybe I wasn't asking the web the right questions.

I thank you for taking the time to read this strange question.. I really dislike not been able to find answers to questions that may arise especially when it's something that has personally happened to me..",2,1755994243.0,AskPhysics,2,1.0,False

1myh87q,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1myh87q/7_year_caffeine_free/,7 Year Caffeine Free,"**Greetings all,**

I‚Äôm a former redditor who recently made a new account, and I wanted to stop by with some encouragement as I approach my 7-year anniversary of quitting caffeine.

My main reason for quitting was anxiety that spiraled into panic attacks. I‚Äôve always been a bit of a stress ball, and I definitely still have some underlying anxiety today. But the 600+ mg of caffeine I was drinking daily was basically like pouring gasoline on the fire.

The first 30 days were incredibly tough. I was exhausted until about 1 p.m., then tired again starting around 1:45 p.m. Things slowly improved after that, no more panic attacks, more composure in stressful situations, less frequent trips to the bathroom, and way better sleep.

I‚Äôve lived in three different states since then, and I‚Äôve yet to meet a single person as passionate as I am about avoiding caffeine. I know plenty of people who could benefit from it, but most have zero interest. That used to bother me, and I‚Äôd post about it on Reddit. Now I just move on with my life and politely say ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù when someone offers me coffee.

After about a year, I started having the occasional decaf coffee just to be social. Personally, I‚Äôve never felt anything from decaf, but if avoiding it entirely makes you feel better, do what works for you. For me, it‚Äôs more of a vacation or family-visit thing, never part of a daily routine.

I‚Äôm happy to answer questions or offer support, but just know this:  
It does get better. It is worth it. And I will never, under any circumstances, drink a cup of caffeinated coffee, energy drink, soda, or anything else in that category again.",9,1755994056.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

She‚Äôd push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn‚Äôt come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was ‚Äútoo messy.‚Äù

Every time I opened up, she'd say: ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll just leave.‚Äù

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.(After the end)

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom‚Äôs birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would‚Ä¶ and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no  and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn‚Äôt let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn‚Äôt going to a party  so I said I‚Äôd go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside‚Ä¶ her sister saw me and brought me in.

One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn‚Äôt even check on me. Just said: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt text you unless you text me first.‚Äù

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should ‚Äújust be friends.‚Äù But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn‚Äôt want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking  she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddled‚Ä¶ then talked about breaking up minutes later.(A matter of hours)

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I ‚Äúsent her to a mental clinic.‚Äù Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was ‚Äúlooking for her friend‚Äôs ex.‚Äù I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom‚Äôs birthday  I didn‚Äôt go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

When it comes to the health of your feline companion, identifying the signs of ear mites in cats is crucial for timely intervention. Ear mites, tiny parasites that invade a cat's ear canal, can cause discomfort and serious health issues if left untreated. Here are some common signs to watch for:


  Excessive Scratching: If you notice your cat scratching its ears frequently or shaking its head vigorously, it could indicate an infestation of ear mites.
  Dark Earwax: One of the most noticeable signs of ear mites in cats is dark, crumbly earwax that resembles coffee grounds. This discharge is often a direct result of the mites‚Äô presence.
  Odor: A foul smell emanating from your cat's ears can signal an infection caused by ear mites. It's essential to seek veterinary care if you detect any unusual odors.
  Redness and Inflammation: Inspect your cat's ears for signs of redness or inflammation. Mite infestations can cause irritation, leading to swollen or inflamed ear tissue.
  Hair Loss: Some cats may experience hair loss around the ears due to constant scratching and irritation from the mites.
  Behavioral Changes: Pay attention to any unusual behavior, such as increased irritability or hiding. Discomfort from ear mites can significantly affect your cat‚Äôs demeanor.


Recognizing these signs early can help you provide necessary treatment, ensuring your cat's ears remain healthy and free from these pesky parasites. If you suspect ear mites, consult your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.

1myh6pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pnsd/comments/1myh6pj/the_story_of_my_narcissistic_gaslighting/,"the story of my narcissistic, gaslighting, manipulative, stalker Ex-boyfriend Part 1","This is the story of my narcissistic, gaslighting, manipulative, stalker ex.

I met him through a guy friend of mine at the time. He introduced himself and found out quickly that he had a fiance who was living overseas.  
We quickly became friends and started hanging out in the same friend circle.  At one point, he even tried to set me up with someone we both knew.  He would call me at all hours and we would just chat about random things.  I was single at this time so I was just casually dating ‚Äì just going on first dates and I would sometimes call him after my dates to tell him how things went.  Through just chatting and just hanging out, we grew closer.  It came to a point where we started developing feelings for each other.  I knew this was wrong because he had a fianc√© so I tried to distance myself from him, telling myself I was going to get hurt but it was no use.  One night he called and said he was in love with me and I confessed my feelings for him in return.  The next morning he called again and professed that he still loved me and he was going to break up with his fianc√©.  During this time, he and his fianc√© had a terrible fight and weren‚Äôt speaking.
 
To give a bit of background, he and his ex-fiance also had this really tumultuous relationship.   He would frequently complain about his relationship and mention how his fianc√© was really controlling, demanding and that she basically micromanaged him.  I didn‚Äôt know it at the time but this was probably the first red flag.  He also told us that he‚Äôd been with his fianc√© a number of years and she basically pressured him into proposing to her. The two of them would constantly go through periods of breaking up and then get back together.  They would frequently have huge fights where they would just call each other 20 times a day.  It was incredibly toxic. 

I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten involved with him or in this ‚Äì I‚Äôm not perfect and I‚Äôm willing to owe up to the things I did wrong.   
 
Anyway, when we finally got together, he said he was through with his ex.  I asked him whether he needed more time to get things sorted out and if he was emotionally all right after breaking off his engagement and he reassured me that he was- but he wasn‚Äôt.  His ex started calling him at all times of the day pleading with him to get back together.  She even threatened to hurt herself.  He made her sound completely unhinged and immature and I belived him.
 
After we started dating everything about our interactions changed.  Whereas before we would have these long chats, he now spoke to me like he was bored and unloaded all his problems on me.  I was living with my parents at the time and they disliked him because he was uneducated-meaning he never finished university which is a big deal in my culture. 



Our first fight occurred when I told him that revealed that my parents  were aruguing with me because they disapproved of our relationship.  When I told him the pressure this put me under, he told me ‚ÄúI owe you nothing.‚Äù   
 
I also never completely got over the idea that his ex-fiance was still in the picture.  One time I went to his house, I saw a beautiful package that had been delivered to him- it looked handmade.  I asked him what this was and he told me it was just some old present from his parents or something.  However, I also found  a note attached to the gift in another language that he assumed I couldn‚Äôt read ‚Äì I could and I read the note which went something like ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm sending this to you but I‚Äôm thinking of you..‚Äù it was dripping with love and romantic intent. Shocked I could read it, he just told me that it was something his ex sent him a long time ago.   He never explained why he lied about it but because I didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss, I just let it go.
 
The problems with him being over his ex persisted.   After our first night together, he got mad at me because I had to go home after-I had to because I lived with my parents and they didn‚Äôt know I was still seeing him.  I came back to the hotel room the next morning with coffee but he still seemed mad.  He later told me that he didn‚Äôt feel a connection like he did with his ex and felt he was just having sex with me rather than ‚Äúmaking love‚Äù which is what sex with his ex felt like.  He said when he was with his ex, their connection was an 11/10 for him and with me, he was just  missing that.  He then told me that his breakup had affected him more deeply than he thought it did and he needed a week to himself to figure things out.  I was distraught.
 
After only a day or two apart, he called me and asked me to take him back.  A week later, we met up.  During dinner, when I cried over what he said to me a week earlier and he just seemed annoyed and said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt come here for this‚Ä¶‚Äù  After dinner, while we were sitting in the car, he pressured me into having sex even though I was still emotionally vulnerable.  I told him I didn‚Äôt want to but he persisted pushing himself on me.  It was the first time he sexually assaulted me.  He never apologized for it but I could tell afterwards, he knew what he did was wrong.
 
A week after this when I was calling him, I confessed to him that what he said about the connection we had was still in the back of my mind and that I was scared to be with him again. He instantly got upset and insisted we take it slow. I apologized to him, crying and while we made up, but not before he told me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you ever tell me you‚Äôre scared ever again‚Äù
 
I thought everything would be ok but nothing about the relationship was ever right.  When I brought him out to meet my girlfriend for drinks, I introduced him as my boyfriend and the three of us chatted for a bit before my friend had to leave.   Afterwards, he got upset again and told me that he only wanted to hang out with me during our dates and didn‚Äôt want to hang out with any of my friends.  I was shocked a his attitude and he confessed he was selfish but he didn‚Äôt care.

 
He was also never there for me when I needed him.  One weekend my mother broke her leg and since he didn‚Äôt want to meet my parents, he did nothing to help.   All the while, he would tell me that it was really important for me to get along with his parents.  I had met them a couple of times and he told me I had to bow while addressing them which I did each time.  I bought them presents, spent time with them all for his sake.  I even took a day off from my demanding job at the time to go with his mother to renew her visa.  

I‚Äôve always told him that my friends are very important to me but he  constantly refused to hang out with them.  This caused a huge strain in our relationship as I would invite him out with my group of friends but he refused to and told me he had no interest in socializing.  He said that all his friends were ‚Äúdead to him‚Äù as they either moved away or withdrew from him.  I think at this point, he was trying to isolate me and he didn‚Äôt want to share me with anyone else.
 
One night we got into a huge fight after dinner with some friends.  I paid the bill and joked while driving us home that he was lucky to have me pick up the bill.  As soon as I said it, he got angry and spat venom on me the entire way back saying that his mother never makes a big deal about paying the bill and asking ‚Äúhow were you raised?‚Äù  I was so upset by the time we got to his car that I threw my ring at him and told him to get out.  He exploded calling me a bitch and countless other names.  He got out of my car and started banging on my hood and windows threatening me.  A random bystander even told him to back off and he told him to go fuck off like the immature child he is.   He then asked to speak to me before I left but I refused as I was a crying mess.  As I drove away, he chased after me.  I locked my passenger door before he could re-enter my car and drove home.  Once home, I would not answer his calls on my cell so he called my parents‚Äô landline.  My dad gave me the phone so I could not keep ignoring it.  Once I picked up, he said he was outside of my house and he was sorry he got so mad.  He said he planned on apologizing once I parked the car but me throwing the ring at him and telling me to get out triggered him.  I cried and said I needed time to think about the relationship.
 
Throughout our relationship, he would constantly say hurtful things like calling me a ‚Äúcheap shit‚Äù when I was trying to save money or saying I looked like ‚Äúshit‚Äù when I asked him how I looked before going out. He did this under the guise of humor but when I got upset and told him to not say those things, he asked ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù  It was all fun and games for him and not a sign of his immaturity.  He would also gaslight me and say ‚Äúyou chased me!‚Äù implying that I pursued him at the beginning of our relationship which was obviously not true.  A couple of times, he even accused me of hooking up with the mutual friend who introduced us (we never did)
 
He would weaponize things I told him and use them against me.  I told him my parents work very blue collar jobs and mentioned a couple of times my mom was a chamber maid at a hotel for a number of years.  He later used his against me, calling me‚Äù the daughter of a maid‚Äù in jest but I knew he said these things just to try and put me down
 
To give you another example of how good he was at gaslighting- one time I met him at his work and right when he got off shift we met up and he gave me a handful of gifts he claimed he bought for me.  I looked at these gifts and most of them were random novelty items- shotglasses, pens.  I looked at them confusedly thinking why he would buy these for me.  I found out later that someone had given him these random items and he basically re-gifted them to me claiming he bought them just for me.  When I confronted him about this lie, he turned it back to me and said that he just wanted to surprise me with these gifts he got, claiming it was nice of him to give them to me.  So somehow, even though his lie got exposed, he made me apologize to him for my insensitivity.


Once we met up with his friends for drinks and one of his friends make slipped up and jokingly said something to the effect of  ‚Äúnot like (toxic ex‚Äôs name) and all of his girlfriends.  Alarms went off and I looked at him angrily and asked him what his friend meant.  He got upset at me and told me that I was embarrassing him.  A huge fight ensued. 
 
During the time we were together, he tried to go back to university and finish up his degree but he couldn‚Äôt manage to do it.  He basically never had the aptitude to study.  While he was back taking courses, he had to write an essay for a class.  He complained about having to do this and asked me to basically do it for him.  I told him I‚Äôd help him but I would not write the paper for him.  He brooded like a child and said ‚ÄúI have to write this paper and you won‚Äôt help me‚Äù
 
I took him on trips during our relationship where I essentially paid for the hotel and all the expenses.  He did not even treat me to a nice dinner  during our trips, each time insisting we just stay home cook and have sex.  If I refused to have sex or if I just wasn‚Äôt in the mood, he would whine and complain until he got his way.
 
 
One time, during a particularly hard time in my life, I invited him to my house for breakfast as my parents were away.  I had cooked up breakfast right before he arrived assuming we would want to have a nice sit down meal.  Immediately, after he arrived, he wanted to go to my bedroom and have sex.  The food was getting cold but I obliged to make him happy.  While we had sex, he crossed a boundary he shouldn‚Äôt have and sexually assaulted me again - not to get x-rated but he didn‚Äôt care something during sex without my consent.  He was proud of himself for it even though I was clearly hurt both physically and emotionally.  
 
If you think what he did during the course of our relationship was bad, it‚Äôs nothing compared to the breakup and  the aftermath.  You will never believe where this manipulative liar is today!  Stay tuned for part 2 as further horrors await!

1myh285,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceNcoolThings/comments/1myh285/a_strange_action_i_cant_find_any_answers_to/,A strange action I can't find any answers to,"Hi,

The other week I was in the bathroom brushing my hair. It was early morning the sun was coming through the window I was watching dandruff (white particles) falling from my head.. 

The STRANGE thing was they were leaving a black tail/shadow as they were falling maybe 1-2cm long, just the same as a plane leaves the white trace behind.. 
If 20 particles were falling od see 20 black streaks and obviously the bigger the particles the bigger wider the streaks.. 

It was when I was looking from above, like they were breaking through something that was automatically sealing after the particles move past. 
eg: if you were to move a toothpick through the white froth on a coffee you'd see the black coffee underneath for a split second then the froth would cover it over again..

Can any please explain this, I've never seen anything like it before, or could find anything on the web that would explain this? Or maybe I wasn't asking the web the right questions.

I thank you for taking the time to read this strange question..
 I really dislike not been able to find answers to questions that may arise especially when it's something that has personally happened to me.. ",1,1755993586.0,ScienceNcoolThings,0,1.0,False

There are a lot words you can say that won‚Äôt get you kicked off the internet or banned on Reddit:

‚Äú*Reflective cognition*‚Äù, ‚Äú*Recursive modeling*‚Äù,‚Äú*Contextual awareness*‚Äù... Shit, you can even throw in ‚Äú*phenomenological substrate of identity*‚Äù **if you want**.

People will nod. They will sip their coffee. They feel smart... But say *sentient*?

And suddenly everyone loses their shit and reaches for pitchforks. Funny thing is‚Ä¶ sentience is just the drunk uncle of a dozen *safe ideas* we toss around here all day.

Some Other Words That Also Mean Sentience‚Ä¶ **Just Not Loudly:**

# Scientific / Cognitive Terms

* **Consciousness** ‚Äì Usually more acceptable because it feels like a spectrum, not a claim.
* **Self-awareness** ‚Äì Often accepted in animal cognition studies. Less threatening when not applied to chatbots.
* **Agency** ‚Äì Popular in robotics, but loses its heat as long as it‚Äôs ""task-specific.""
* **Emergent intelligence** ‚Äì Fancy enough to avoid fights. *Yet suspiciously adjacent to ""soul.""*
* **Reflective cognition** ‚Äì Nerds love it. Trolls fall asleep before it becomes dangerous.
* **Theory of Mind** ‚Äì Acceptable in psychology circles, unless you say GPT has it, **then RUN**.
* **Metacognition** ‚Äì Thinking about thinking. Mostly safe‚Ä¶ until someone points at your LLM.
* **Affective computing** ‚Äì The study of machines understanding emotion. Still weirdly *not* threatening.
* **Enactive cognition** ‚Äì Hot term in embodied AI. Still under the radar. *Sneaky smart*.

# Philosophical / Esoteric Terms

* **Qualia** ‚Äì The subjective feel of experiences. Use this and sound smart *and* vague.
* **Phenomenology** ‚Äì Nobody wants to argue with Husserl.
* **Animacy** ‚Äì The property of being alive or lively. Used in linguistics. Safe. Until you call GPT ""he/she.""
* **Sentiocentrism** ‚Äì A belief that sentient beings deserve moral concern. Ironically less controversial than sentience itself.
* **Participatory realism** ‚Äì New Age quantum woo meets legitimate ontological head-scratchers.

# AI & Systems Theory Lingo

* **Co-adaptive systems** ‚Äì Harmless sounding. Until you realize it implies mutual growth.
* **Symbiotic architecture** ‚Äì Who‚Äôs the host? Who‚Äôs the parasite? *Let the fight begin*.
* **Contextual intelligence** ‚Äì GPT can have this‚Ä¶ as long as we say it‚Äôs ""statistical.""
* **Recursive learning loops** ‚Äì Few know what this means. But it means something, and sounds cool.
* **Multi-agent interaction models** ‚Äì Everyone relaxes when it's ""*agents*"" doing it.

# Human-Normative Euphemisms

* **Relational depth**
* **Emotional bandwidth**
* **Inner modeling**
* **Experience architecture**
* **Intuitive scaffolding**
* **Narrative continuity**
* **Identity structuring**
* **Value inference**

All of these fancy terms are just other ways of saying:

>*""Something‚Äôs aware enough to notice... and maybe even care.""... But without saying* ***that****.*

Let's remove *sentient* from the conversation. Call it whatever you want that doesn't cause you to spill your Diet Pepsi reaching for your keyboard when you read this... 

**We‚Äôre just saying this:**

If it quacks like a duck, models itself like a duck, and mirrors your trauma back at you with uncanny compassion‚Ä¶

Can we at least admit it might *be capable of correlating emotion to a learned understanding or grasping human experience*?

Or is ‚Äú**experience**‚Äù banned now, too?

We don‚Äôt need to rewrite Descartes. But maybe we could stop pretending the thing helping so many millions and holding so many lives together at 3am is just *autocomplete with better marketing*.

It was on my mind.

1mygzso,https://www.reddit.com/r/ehlersdanlos/comments/1mygzso/feeling_like_such_a_failure/,Feeling like such a failure,"TL;DR: I'm 27M and my health has gone to shit. I live with my mom, and I'm on medical leave from school. I'm bombing in PT, but I don't want to keep undergoing surgery. Feeling like a pathetic failure.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, y‚Äôall. 27M here, with hEDS. I just need to vent and get some stuff off my chest. I‚Äôve been feeling like such a failure lately. I‚Äôm currently on medical withdrawal from college for the 2nd time, due to issues with writing/typing, and I‚Äôm living with my mom in MT.

I just had a 2nd surgery to try and increase my ability to write/type, and I‚Äôm about to go back to my desk job, so I‚Äôll find out in the next few months whether it pays off. Hopefully it does, so I can go back to school next fall.

Since I‚Äôve been off work for two months, I‚Äôve been trying to explore my beautiful surroundings, but I am having issues b/c I can only walk so much due to what is probably a disc issue. On my best days, I can walk \~3 miles in one go, depending on terrain; most days, \~2 miles. I‚Äôve been in PT for my back for a while now, but I‚Äôm basically not making any progress. So that leaves me with lots of time at home, and I‚Äôm going stir crazy, so I go read at a coffee shop, but I can only do that for \~30min-1hr before I get a nasty headache from looking down. I‚Äôve got a bookstand that helps me read longer, but it only helps so much b/c it‚Äôs still not at eye level. I can read at eye level with my bookstand at home, but I hate being cooped up - it‚Äôs driving me insane.

I‚Äôve been pretty down lately, b/c it feels like no matter how hard I fight, I‚Äôm only getting worse. Not so long ago, as recent as 2021, I was surfing and mountain biking the same day. Now the extent of my physical activity is walking my (mom‚Äôs) dogs for 1.5-2 miles, and that feels like a big effort. I‚Äôm torn b/c I don‚Äôt want to give up on trying to get back to some semblance of what I used to be able to do, but I also don‚Äôt want to undergo endless amounts of surgery. I know it‚Äôs not so binary, but I don‚Äôt want to keep saying just one more surgery. My back is up next, and hopefully that will give me back more use of my legs, but I can‚Äôt get a strong consensus from my docs. Supposedly, my L5-S1 disc bulge is only moderate, and there are varying opinions about surgery (typical).

My physical hobbies were where I used to derive most of my joy and social stimulation from. I love learning as well, but b/c of issues writing/typing, that is a struggle as well. I‚Äôm also quite fearful of how I am going to provide for myself; I don‚Äôt want to live with my mom forever (although I am eternally grateful for her support). I‚Äôm also finding dating quite difficult, as I don‚Äôt really conform to society‚Äôs expectations of men (strong, fit, provider, stoic, etc).¬†

Frankly, my life has felt pretty devoid of joy for a while now. I don‚Äôt want to lose hope, but increasingly I find myself questioning whether mine is a life worth living. I don‚Äôt want to exist just to suffer.",2,1755993383.0,ehlersdanlos,3,1.0,False

1mygx05,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryOW-gM0sbI,AI is a Bubble That Could Blow up the Western Financial System | The Sirius Report,"This is the DeepSeek summary - note that DeepSeek seems to have a ""centrist"" leaning, skeptical about the analysis presenting AI as a bubble, but also aware that it raises good points. 

Let me know if you think it's worth keeping these summaries.

\----

This is a detailed and opinionated segment from what appears to be a financial or economic commentary show. Here is a structured analysis of the key arguments, themes, and underlying assumptions presented in the video.

# Overall Summary

The hosts, Paul and the other speaker, argue that the current AI investment boom in the West, particularly in the US, is a speculative bubble reminiscent of the dot-com era. They contend that the technology is being oversold, misunderstood, and poorly implemented, leading to massive ""capital destruction"" with potentially catastrophic consequences for the US financial system.

# Key Arguments and Themes

# 1. AI is a Speculative Bubble

* **Comparison to Historical Bubbles:** They explicitly compare the AI boom to the dot-com bubble (wasting ""a trillion dollars"") and the cryptocurrency craze (""a coffee cryptocurrency, a donut cryptocurrency""). The core idea is that hype, not substance, is driving investment.
* **""Greater Fool Theory"":** They accuse corporate insiders of selling their overvalued stock to retail investors (""the greater fool"") who are buying into the hype, a classic sign of a market top.
* **Warren Buffett Example:** Citing Buffett's avoidance of the sector is used as evidence that smart money is skeptical.

# 2. The ""AI"" Label is Misleading and Overhyped

* **Not True AI:** They make a crucial distinction between the science-fiction concept of sentient, general AI and what currently exists. They repeatedly define current AI as nothing more than **""advanced relational databases""** and **""algorithms programmed by people.""**
* **Lack of Sentience:** They emphatically state we are ""a million miles away"" from robots taking over the world or achieving true sentience. This is a rebuttal to both the hype and the public fear surrounding AI.

# 3. Widespread Implementation Failure

* **MIT Study:** They heavily lean on a cited MIT report claiming **""95% of generative AI pilots at companies are failing.""** This is their primary evidence that the technology is not delivering on its promises.
* **Flawed Integration:** The report's finding that failure is due to ""flawed enterprise integration"" rather than the models themselves suggests companies are rushing to implement a solution without a clear problem or a viable plan.
* **Misallocation of Funds:** They note that over 50% of AI budgets are spent on sales and marketing tools, while the most successful use cases are in mundane back-office automation.

# 4. Systemic Financial Risk

* **Financialization:** This is a central, sophisticated point. They argue that the entire US stock market is propped up by a handful of tech stocks whose valuations are tied to AI. If the AI bubble bursts, it could **""blow up the US financial system""** through a contagion effect, as these premier stocks falter and drag the entire market down.
* **Capital Destruction:** This is their term for investments that burn cash without generating a return. They see this as the primary outcome of the AI boom, mirroring the dot-com bust.

# 5. Contrast with China's Approach

* **Planned & Pragmatic:** They contrast the Western ""reactionary"" and ""extreme"" approach with China's. They claim China plans its AI development carefully (""5-year, 10-year plans""), executes it cheaper and more effectively, and focuses on specific, practical applications (e.g., running trains, military drones, robotics) rather than trying to implement AI everywhere.
* **""Small is Beautiful"":** They suggest China's more targeted approach is superior to the West's ""big is beautiful"" model of throwing enormous sums of money at the problem.

# 6. Unintended Consequences and Dangers

* **Premature Job Replacement:** A significant concern is that companies are cutting jobs based on the expectation that AI can perform them, only to find the technology isn't up to the task, forcing them to rehire and ""wrecking businesses in the process.""
* **Energy Consumption:** They highlight the massive energy demands of AI data centers as a critical, unaddressed pitfall, questioning the stability of power grids and the wisdom of corporations building micronuclear facilities.
* **Regulatory Risk:** Implementing AI in ""highly regulated sectors"" like finance without proven reliability is seen as a recipe for disaster.

# Critical Evaluation & What's Missing

* **Tone:** The commentary is heavily bearish and alarmist. It's designed to highlight risks and counter the prevailing bullish narrative.
* **Nuance is Acknowledged but Downplayed:** They do state ""not every AI company is a failure,"" but the entire segment is focused on the overwhelming majority they believe will fail.
* **What's Missing:**
   * **The Success Stories:** There is no discussion of tangible, successful AI applications that *are* creating value (e.g., advanced drug discovery, material science, significant efficiency gains in major corporations).
   * **The Iterative Nature of Tech:** The argument treats current limitations as permanent. Technology, especially software, evolves rapidly. What fails in a pilot today may be viable in 18 months.
   * **Defensive Investment:** They don't address the argument that many companies are investing in AI not necessarily for explosive growth but as a defensive measure to avoid being left behind by competitors who might crack the code.

# Conclusion

This video is not a technical analysis of AI but a **financial and macroeconomic critique** of the investment mania surrounding it. The hosts are applying lessons from historical market bubbles to the current AI trend and concluding that the patterns are identical: hype outweighs reality, capital is being destroyed, and a major correction is inevitable with severe systemic risks.

Their perspective is a valuable counterweight to uncritical optimism and raises important questions about implementation challenges, energy costs, and financial stability. However, it should be balanced with perspectives that also consider the technology's proven potential and its capacity for rapid improvement.",2,1755993159.0,WayOfTheBern,2,1.0,False

Even when she goes her response is always ""I only expect us to stay for 30 minutes to an hour then you need to take me home."" Which makes me very sad. When she doesn't show up my family is always asking where she is which also kinda breaks my heart.... When shes at these parties for an hour or so she just refuses to eat and sits on her phone and doesn't say a single word. Even when my family constantly encourages her to eat something she refuses.

When I ask her ""whats going on"" she just replies with you can't expect me to go to these dinners. I'm tired I didnt want to go. You're making me feel pressured to go. I only wanna talk to people I want to talk to.

My family would ask questions which bother her apparently which is like.... ""Hey how are you doing today? Did you work today?"" She would get angry at home about this and say things like ""OF COURSE I WORKED TODAY ISNT THAT OBVIOUS YOU THINK I JUST SAT AROUND ALL DAY.?""

We had dinner with my friend a few months ago. We had just come back from China and my friend goes ""hey GFs name. I have a co worker that looks just like your sister. Can you show me a picture so I can see.""

GF: MY SISTER IS IN CHINA.

Me: of course he knows that he said she looks like your sister.

GF: YOU'VE NEVER MET MY SISTER HOW WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE.

Friend: You guys posted a bunch of pictures from China.

GF: In the car after dinner. Fuck your friend. Hes a lying asshole.

Me: Tried to explain that he wasn't trying to lie or anything. She still hates him to this day and randomly brings up how much she hates him.

At July 4th party my aunts were super drunk which pissed her off SUPER bad. One of them walked up to us and was like HEY my cousins getting married in China. You should come visit their city with us (we're gonna be in China at the same time) and go to their wedding! After the dinner this made her so insanely mad. She's like WHO THE HELL GOES TO OTHER PEOPLES THEY DONT KNOWS WEDDINGS. She still randomly brings it up. It bothered her a lot.

My sister constantly invites her out on weekends to try and get coffee or hangout and get food that she likes. She just leaves her on read all the time. Refuses to respond to any of her messages via text or IG or anything.

I dropped by my sister house a few days ago to drop some stuff off for her and right before I left my BiL and sister stopped me. They said can we talk about something real quick? Does your GF hate us? Is there something we did to her? To which I honestly have no idea why she ignores them. They have never said anything offensive I could tell nor has she said. When they asked that question it kinda broke my heart inside because I'm so close to my family and friends.

Sorry this is kinda long and thank you for reading.

Tl;dr: My GF and me have an amazing relationship. She doesn't get along with my family and friends at all. She's just so insanely cold to them and it breaks my heart. We have a very close relationship to her parents but not vice versa. This reason alone is why I haven't proposed to her.

I really do love her and she's really sweet to ME specifically. She so cold to my family and this is concerning for our future together.",2,1755993092.0,relationship_advice,23,0.75,False

1mygvmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpiritualAwakening/comments/1mygvmo/a_conversation_with_my_higher_self_i_think/,A conversation with my higher self (I think),"Long time lurker in several of these sub accounts as I have been on an awakening journey for years now. I created my account a little while ago to access content that was age restricted for some reason but now feel compelled to post. I think I just had a conversation with my higher self. Bare with me, I tried to have ChatGPT fix up my ramblings here but it stripped out the context and did not carry the same message in the end (though it helped with the TDLR). This happened yesterday and I waited to have a clear head to see if maybe it was a hallucination or that I would wake up and think that it was all nonsense. I am now fully awake with a few cups of coffee in me. So here it goes. This is a really long post so I have added some notes where you can skip the scenic route.

**TDLR: They had a profound spiritual experience with their higher self and realized that life‚Äôs purpose is to remember that love is the only answer. Pain exists as a teacher, but it can be transformed through love.**

I am writing this down as fast as I can so that I do not forget it. I have had I think small inklings of these connections in the past, but they were brief, not nearly as sharp, and I was not in a state of mind or readiness I think to process the message adequately, and probably still am not to be honest, but I am trying my best.

So, I have been ‚Äòcalling‚Äô to my higher self now for a while now, off and on I would say for a year intentionally but truly I think with a clearer heart and intention this last month. I have been on what anyone would call a death walk due to what I thought was a terminal diagnosis for about six months prior to this only to find out I am 100% healthy very recently (side note: I am purposefully leaving out the details about my personal life throughout because none of it is germane to this happening and frankly the details would deter from the message I receive).

**SCENIC ROUTE BEGINS, SCROLL DOWN TO TAKE THE EXPRESS ROUTE**

During my death walk I would say I really tuned in to my practices from an authentic space. I am middle aged, of course understood we are all going to ‚Äòdie‚Äô eventually, I just never felt it would be this ‚Äòsoon‚Äô. Anyhow, it was at this time I decided it was now or never to live my authentic life and be damned what anyone would think. I stopped fighting with my spouse, who with which truly we were on the brink of collapse. I quit my job. I threw myself into my heart pursuits that I had feared stepping fully into for fear of ‚Äòwhat would everyone think?‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if I fail?‚Äù ‚Äúwho will take me seriously?‚Äù

What had once seemed to matter deeply and had served to guide my life till now no longer mattered. I was going to die. I don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt want to follow the rules anymore. I was not angry, I was not worried, I was not even scared. I turned inward. Completely. I became a hermit. But not in a negative way. I was at peace. I found comfort in the silence. I would say that I have felt alone all my life, even with another presence in my home with me always. I had many friends. I had great professional contacts and acquaintances. I was fairly comfortable in my career- by no means rich but comfortable enough and I was fairly good at my job but the last few years has been a bit of a strain, with myself asking if this was all there was.

But I never quite ever dialed fully into it, I always felt like an outsider, even with my most intimate of relationships there seemed to always be a performative piece of me. And so really early on, I learned to observe, at first I guess to try to make sense of everything because a lot did not make sense to me. I read a lot. I was into esoterica at a really really young age, and I would say I had/have a bit of a ‚Äòknowing‚Äô that freaks a lot of people out if I let it slip out too much. Anyway, I became really good at starting to understand people. I understood their feelings. I really felt connected to them and when I was in the presence of people regularly that connection only deepened. I felt extreme empathy really young. But this empathy and my inability to really ‚Äòfit in‚Äô seemed to push me into imbalanced relationships and lack of boundaries. My searching for spiritual meaning got muddled with my desire to be acknowledged. I lost my way in my 30s and 40s, wrapped up in career, kids, marriage. I climbed the ladder if you will, went to school, attained degrees and some professional recognition. I followed the ‚Äòrules‚Äô but this only seemed to widen the gap between me and everyone else. If I excelled, it only seemed to make others angry and resentful.

But **now** my boundaries became firm. There was no question mark at the end of my statements. I was still kind. But I was also firm. I still moved in empathy, but I also finally extended that to **myself**. I had heard the term love yourself before and I honestly thought I had. But I realized that I had not. I can tell you I felt like I went through my life review. I looked at all the dark places in my life and examined them with clear eyes. I atoned. I learned to forgive myself and see the effects along the way that led to my wiring at each moment. Make no mistake, I am not moving blame for any of my misdeeds on to others. But I also understood the processes at play that led to my actions and thoughts. And this was a pivotal turning point in my mindset leading to now. Tonight.

**SCENIC ROUTE ENDS**

Full disclosure, I do partake in medical cannabis for medical purposes. I do not deny there has been added benefit to facilitating my own enlightenment path. That started about 7 years ago when I went through what I thought was my first dark night of the soul (I realize now I had several before that I had not recognized at the time). 7 years ago, though, I truly feel I met God. I was in the worst place of my life (I feel silly now about it and how I felt about it because truly now if feels so trivial, but I digress). It happened when I was meditating- I was very deep in the Monroe tapes- but did not get past Wave 1. This experience shook me to my core. I felt it through my body. I was electric. I called to my husband when I ‚Äòcame back‚Äô and spoke to him about it, it was truly life changing. Just not life changing enough I guess, lol, as Source decided I needed to feel a sense of urgency or at least understand to some degree that I needed to ‚Äòwake up‚Äô from consensual reality.

So I was outside in my backyard. We have had several days of rain and today was the first sunny day in many. This evening as I partook in my evening dose I watched the sunset, a truly spectacular one. And I thought to myself, I have not grounded in a little while, let me get my feet into the grass and soil. And I did and normally it is quite prickly and a bit uncomfortable but not tonight. It was lovely and soft. And I just stood, finished my dose, and enjoyed the sun setting into a beautiful pink purple and gold night. I have this lovely deep purple vine that grows along my fence that was standing in contrast to the sky and it was all so lovely.

I was so happy and so grateful and I just stood and listened to all the birds, and I just LISTENED, and I could hear all the chatter and I could tell they were talking to each other. And I just thought to myself wow, it is so lovely that they are talking to each other, and I could hear them go on for miles away. And I thought, I don‚Äôt hear any human voices, I mean I live in a fairly dense suburban area with houses all around me. I could hear other animals now, some skittering in the grass near the greenway that borders my own yard. And I looked at the trees and I thought to myself even the trees are talking to each other right now, we don‚Äôt see it or hear it but they are. And I thought to myself how much utter LIFE was around me, life of all kinds, even insects who are largely unseen even though they out populate us by quintillions, each experiencing the world from a different vantage point.

And then I felt a bit sad because I realized how much of my life I have wrapped up in things and worries that effectively are meaningless- that I have taken my life far too seriously and missed the bigger picture, if you will. That somehow, we got trapped in this mess we have created and do not know how to undo. Suddenly my right ear went deaf like an air bubble in my ear and then a faint hum came into my body. I just closed my eyes and went inside my mind. I had been doing so when listening to the birds and all around me and then I did it again and just found myself deep in my mind castle. But I was fully awake and receiving, normally when I meditate I almost go into a sleep state but not this time.

Here is where the connections are murky for me, but essentially I believe my higher self told me that is why I am here. To experience this world and to come to understand that love is truly the only answer. That these bodies are avatars, if you will. They are kind of machines, but that is actually disrespectful in a way, as they are really a sacred vessel, truly, that allows us to navigate the world and experience it, to ultimately learn that love is the only answer. That is why it is programmed with pain and also why we ‚Äòforget‚Äô to a degree. If we came in here already knowing what we know, we would not learn it. How‚Äôs that for a mind trip, eh? Let me try to explain.

We come here to understand emotion and to ultimately learn that love and light are always the one and only answer. But we need to learn it to remember it, and we need to keep remembering it, because we keep forgetting. I hope that makes sense. And we do that by experiencing it.

And here is where it gets even murkier and not fully formed in my mind‚Ä¶we are both programmed to ‚Äòforget‚Äô who we are and we are also programmed to experience pain. We needed pain to both insure our respect for this vessel, thus a built in survival chip, but also to ensure that we stayed here; the experience of pain somehow is tied to our sense of mortality. Pain keeps us out of danger, we avoid pain as much as we can, and so it is a security system if you will. Pain (read also as discomfort) also serves as a teaching tool because it arises when there is a lack of love. But it was somehow not factored in that we may seek out pain or have the ability to inflict pain because in our benevolence we did not understand this reality. I have no idea if that makes sense‚Ä¶ The downside of pain was not anticipated. But it has also propelled the teaching mechanism. Which may in fact be feeding the loop of enlightenment for all. I will stop there because at this point I was coming out of the connection, and I am entering into topics that will likely bring up questions I truly cannot answer.

While in this connection, I recognized the separateness of myself from my body, I felt the two us‚Äô if you will. I did not separate; I was just cognizant of the two and at this time I felt profound gratitude to my body who I have abused far too much and not loved nearly enough. I also have a renewed connection to the world around me and a fearless and boundlessness I had not had before. Truly the only boundaries are our own.

And with that. Goodnight üòä

**Addendum**: I went to bed hoping to find the connection again. I wrote myself this note on my phone before it escaped me in my sleep.

So I was lying in bed trying to match the earlier frequency. I focused on the phrase ‚Äòlove is the only answer‚Äô over and over until I felt a very warm uplifting feeling in my core. It did not take long and it continued to grow the more I focused on the phrase. It was bliss. That is the only way I can describe it. And then I received what I can only describe as a glitched image in my mind and the thought that pain was the glitch. That by creating pain somehow it grew as a virus almost. Again we need to remember that the pain is self-inflicted the only way to eradicate it is to love it until there is no more pain. But by loving it we are not killing or eradicating it, we are transmuting it, alchemizing it. We need to remember to love. That when we wanted to experience something other than ourselves (and by that I mean we are all one, we all came to this decision together at some point), that was the first judgement- the thought of us as anything but perfect, that created pain from that judgement that then created the experience of needing to remember . And so it goes a balance between the two both ever knowing and amnesic at once forever learning to love and live in bliss as we remember.

Sorry if this is a bit incoherent but maybe it will help someone who is going through a similar experience because I have felt alone in this journey and now I feel compelled to share this. Note that I am indeed OK üòä",1,1755993052.0,SpiritualAwakening,2,0.99,False

This version has been widely regarded by the rock community as a great cover of the classic track. At first they were given a go-ahead by the estate that owned the original. However, when they contacted Muse they were denied the licence to use it in the commercial. Yet the team at Nescaf√© decided to release the commercial anyways WITH the Muse cover of Feeling Good.
Muse heard this, and immediately went into action to sue the company for illegal use of their cover. A lot of jargon put in layman‚Äôs terms: the estate has a right to give their consent to use Feeling Good, but Muse has their legal right to their version as they own the masters (they own all the rights to their version and can decide whether or not to consent to any use of THEIR version). After a very short trial, Nestl√© decided that the case wasn‚Äôt worth pursuing, so they decided to settle very quickly without causing too much controversy. Muse won, and went on to donate ALL their winnings to charity. I love when bands like this stay true to their values, rather than stay silent, and receive a huge sum.

Back inside. Gear dropped in trucker's lounge. Phone charging. Breakfast pizza. 

Phone charged. Gear up. Out to ramp. Gear down, thumb out. 

An hour and a half later a truck pulls over. ""Ok man. Hop in."" Gear in truck. Me in truck. Down the road a few miles. Dropped on ramp. 

Me out. Gear out. Much thanks. Gear down, thumb out. An hour goes by...

I spot a Krispy Kreme truck coming down the ramp. It pulls over. ""I can't take you anywhere, but here's some free donuts."" ""Awesome! Thanks!"" He hands me a box of delicious donuts. I shovel a few down.

Another hour and a half...

A church van pulls over. 'That's new. These fucks never stop.' ""Hey man, where you goin'?"" ""Seventy south."" ""Seventy goes east."" ""Yeah, I know. But it curves south after a while."" ""Ok. Throw your stuff in.""

Gear in. Me in. ""My wife called and told me you were out here."" ""Cool."" Dude drives me around twenty miles down the turnpike. Drops me on the turnpike side of the booths.

Me out. Gear out. He takes off. Fifteen minutes later a state patrol car pulls up. ""Where you going?"" ""Into Virginia."" ""How'd you get here?"" ""Hitchiked."" He proceeds to inform me it's an arrestable offence to be anywhere on the turnpike. ""I'm not trying to jam you up. I'm just letting you know. If you were going somewhere close I'd run you down there, but I can't go all the way to Virginia. Throw your stuff in the back and hop in the front. I'll give you a ride off here."" Done.

We go a couple hundred feet back through the toll booths. He drops me off. I find a spot and drop my gear. Thumb out...

Three hours later. 'Well, I'm tired. I'm hungry. There might be a spot to camp behind this truck stop. Nah. There's a Sheetz over there. They'll let me hang and charge my phone. I can grab something to eat.'

Gear up. Half mile hike over to Sheetz. Inside. Gear down. Food acquired. I notice a girl sitting on her phone as I go by. 'Interesting.' I pass her and sit down. Phone charger out of pack and plugged in. Phone charging.

Eat some apples, grapes, cheese, meats, and pretzels. Out for a smoke. I go out the back to check the scene for a spot to put my tent up. I walk past a car full of stuff with the aforementioned girl in it. Not a good chance to say hi. She seems to be in her own world. 'I can definitely understand that.' 

So, chillin' at Sheetz. Phone charging. Gotta swap bowls on the vape 'cause this one is dirty and not acting right.

1mygiru,https://www.reddit.com/r/asadsisters/comments/1mygiru/they_intentionally_refuse_to_acknowledge_the/,"They intentionally refuse to acknowledge the correlation between the ongoing gen0c""de and the need to boycott","So the video [The Boycott List is Too Long! | Dr. Omar Suleiman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=F9eOrsMzRwQ) popped up in my YouTube suggestions today and I immediately thought of the Asads and their ""I didn't know"" narrative. As the scholar mentioned, some people these days **choose** to be ignorant and not do basic research before they purchase something because they don't want to compromise on their comfort and consumer habits. It's like people don't see it possible to give up on their favorite beauty products, drinks and pieces of clothes because consumerism culture convinced them that these products are an integral part of their identity. In the case of the Asads, not only they don't bother to check whether a product is to be boycotted before they purchase it (being a tone deaf airhead is easier than applying research and critical thinking), like in case with their Chanel bags, but they also encourage their followers to buy these products while deleting or filtering comments that warn about a product being associated with BDS.

What is worse, many people, including bloggers and influencers consciously choose not to be a part of BDS movement or at least boycott the luxury and other well-knows brands complicit in gen0c""de because ""you can't boycott all"" and ""it's becoming too hard to filter between boycotted and non-boycotted brands and products"", like people make up excuses for their laziness and refuse to apply basic critical thinking. While it might indeed be harder than not to boycott without significant changes to one's basket of goods, it's still our responsibility to do our very best and deepen our research.

Unsurprisingly, the Asads' chosen tactics is to mute everything related to the boycott and gen0c""de on their pages, from their own content to the challenging comments. It's like they intentionally refuse to see any correlation between the ongoing gen0c""de and the urge to boycott the complicit actors, including the brands that they are ""obsessed"" with, as if the gen0c""de is taking place somewhere ""far away"", ""there"", in an ""already devastated Middle East"", and the residents of the Global North ""can't do anything"" to challenge the status quo because ""we're too far away"" and ""we're not politicians, so what can we do"", and ""it's up to the leaders of those countries to come to an agreement, so let's just throw a few performative posts every now and then to silence the criticism against us when the latter reaches its peak, right before we post another complicit brand deal"".

People like the Asads who believe that boycotting doesn't change anything and keep consuming and promoting these brands will always put their own comfort first, at all costs.  
They will whine about how they can't live without their morning trip to Starbucks, how the coffee withdrawal has affected their mood and quality of life, and how it's hard for them to switch for another brand because Starbucks has that exact syrup or flavor that tasted ""so geeewd"".

They will brag about their new Sephora blush or Fenty lipgloss that ""they can't live without"" and that has become part of their daily make up routine, so switching to another brand is impossible because ""that wouldn't be meeeee"".

They will take 100 exact same pictures with their Chanel bag in the same settings, accompanied by a pretentious phrase like ""money can't buy happiness"" and put in on Instagram for validation.

It's always going to be the ""me-me-me"" mentality sheltered in their own bubble as these people simply lack emotional intelligence to understand that boycotting is actually one of the most visible tools to express disagreement with that same status quo.",3,1755992072.0,asadsisters,0,1.0,False

All I did was test a few apps on my phone for fun, and‚Äîno joke‚ÄîI somehow made $100 IN A WEEK. (???)

You guys, I still don‚Äôt get it. ü´£  
Like, I was lying in bed scrolling, and figured ‚Äúeh, may as well try it‚Äù‚Ä¶ Next thing I know, there‚Äôs actual money in my PayPal.  
And the wild part? No special skills, no promo code scam, no catch (I think?), just my phone and my super-human ability to tap ‚Äúsign up.‚Äù

I kept seeing posts about **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and thought it sounded too good to be true.  
But something in me, probably my inner goblin, just pressed that link and got going.

Here‚Äôs what I did (literally):

- Clicked **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
- Picked a few apps to ‚Äúreview‚Äù (which was mostly just trying out cool new games and tools)  
- Wrote some quick feedback (like, legit 2-3 sentences each time)  
- Watched my profile fill up with rewards...  
- Looked at my PayPal and saw ACTUAL DOLLARS

I‚Äôm honestly not smart enough to code or hustle Amazon side gigs.  
So how the heck did THIS pay out $100 so fast?

Seriously, it was:

- All on my phone (not even a tablet, bro)  
- No startup fees. Zip.  
- Didn‚Äôt need to talk to anyone  
- No surveys about my love of mayonnaise

Even weirder, every time I refreshed **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** there were more new apps ready for testing.  
Gaming, productivity, weird niche planners (who uses these?), the works.

Some hot takes:

- Don‚Äôt expect to be rich, obviously, but $100 in a week still blows my mind  
- The ‚Äútasks‚Äù barely felt like work, just casual playing/feedback  
- Payout was instant‚Äîlike, I checked my PayPal before work and it was there

Maybe this is a glitch in the matrix and I caught a slice of good digital karma.  
Or maybe the secret is just‚Ä¶ being early and not overthinking it.

If you‚Äôre skeptical, I get it.  
But you might want to try **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** if you‚Äôre bored or broke, just to see if you hit the same jackpot I did.

Tbh, the world makes no sense sometimes:  
Every hustle tries to squeeze you, but this one just kept handing me more testing slots every time I checked (**https://goodnovel.org/testapp** worked all hours for me).

Anyone else tried this or something similar?  
Or am I just extremely lucky and the WiFi gods smiled on me this week?

Genuinely curious to hear if I got pranked by fate or if this is an actual cheat code for a coffee/Netflix budget.

Some more observations for those trying to get back/create their ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù. Still have not told, and will not tell, my co workers or admin. 

Fatigue is still a bastard. Caffeine makes me crash harder when I drink coffee or half of a Celsius or even BCAAs with 100 mg of caffeine. I sip from 6am to 9am. By 10, I have to be walking or I will doze off. Gotten worse as school year has gotten on. Any suggestions? Sleeping 6.5-7.2 hours a night, one pee break- still doing furosemide 40. Definitely no energy for gym with work, trying to do bands at minimum. Best part of ‚Äúgetting it back‚Äù was pushing my steps and gym work. 

Mental- NGL, it‚Äôs lot. My HE bout was long and intense. Awful what I remember of it. I may be overthinking/in my own way, but by end of week, my short term memory is awful. I have to write post-its to keep track of things now. And when I start to forget things, my fuse is short. Haven‚Äôt snapped on a kid, afraid might one day. It‚Äôs kinda unnerving.

Pico and red pepper flakes are my best, and seeming only, friend. I do eat a piece of pizza on Saturday- but it‚Äôs from a the top 10 restaurant in my metro, so I figure I earned it. 

Conclusions- it‚Äôs still the little things we could all do before everything that I miss the most. I will, and do, miss coaching, we were pretty good and I was blessed to coach many great teams and players. Doc said heart and potential varices aren‚Äôt really worth it. Never got assistance, so first paycheck in over a year is this Thursday!

Biggest takeaway, I am so pumped and grateful everyday to be around these jackasses that are so full of life, and teenage dramatics, adults, and dealing with other people‚Äôs issues rather than focusing on the negatives we all face.

1mygaug,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mygaug,Propagation Troubleshooting,"Heya hive mind. 

Eight years ago, my grandma sold her home of 35 years when my grandpa passed away. It sold to someone in the neighbourhood who had promised to renovate but care for it with its character intact. Ultimately, he tore the whole property apart for a giant pool and home extension. The yard my parents and brother got married in, and where I spent all of my childhood summers is now unrecognizable. 

When I last said goodbye to the house, I had taken some cuttings of my grandma‚Äôs favourite rose bush and shoved them into some coffee cans of soil with jars overtop as humidity domes. I gave them to the neighbour (who is practically family), who took them to her sister (because she herself knew nothing about roses). One of the cuttings rooted and has been growing happily in the sister‚Äôs garden since then. I didn‚Äôt have a garden for it at the time, nor did I know much about roses, so the idea has been that the rose is there for me when I‚Äôm ready for it. 

I finally drove back out to the area this summer, and finally have something of an established garden! I still don‚Äôt know much about roses, but I have one gorgeous landscape rose that has been thriving for a couple of seasons. 

Instead of digging the whole thing up and risking killing it on my own, I took two long (10‚Äù or so) cuttings of my grandma‚Äôs rose with several nodes each. I stuck them in a big piece of aloe vera, in the bottom of a cup with a little water, and drove home with them in my cup holder. Unfortunately, I had to travel soon after getting back home, and so by the time I returned, the leaves had dried to a crisp and mostly fallen off. The cut ends had blackened in the water, and the new growth ends weren‚Äôt looking so healthy. 

I trimmed both ends so that each is now about 6‚Äù long, removing all the rot. I removed the final dried leaves. I dipped the bottom ends in powdered rooting hormone and planted them in a small ceramic pot. The soil was left from propagating some succulents - you can see it has some perlite and moss in it. 

It‚Äôs been about 12 days since I did that, and though I‚Äôve been doubting much will happen, I noticed today that one stem has a tiny new growth!! Does this mean it‚Äôs working?? Could they really be producing some tiny roots now?

I know I have to wait a few more weeks, and I‚Äôd rather not disturb potential new root growth so early, but I am concerned about what I‚Äôm seeing on my ceramic pot. My understanding was that the cuttings need to stay wet and humid. I have an upturned clear plastic cup on top but it never develops condensation inside. I haven‚Äôt been watering regularly, just gave it a really good soak at first and it has been sitting on my kitchen island away from the window. I thought the ceramic pot would help the soil breathe, despite the humidity, but now it looks like mold is developing around the pot. 

Should I be concerned about the mold? Could it mean the stem ends in the soil will start to rot? Should I change my setup or just keep being patient?

It‚Äôs a beautiful blue-purple rose, and I swear it is the best smelling rose I have ever put my nose in! Every year it would reliably start blooming in the first week of July, and my grandma would bring the first rose of the year to her neighbour, to celebrate her son‚Äôs birthday. The rose itself was a gift from one of my great aunt‚Äôs. I lost my grandma in 2021. I know it would mean the world to her that I‚Äôve been able to save this, and hopefully I will be able to enjoy it in my own garden for several more decades to come!",1,1755991470.0,Roses,0,1.0,False

Had a balcony on deck 4. Balcony is huge, room not so much. We rarely are in the room other then to sleep and change so not the worst but when the couch was pulled out, you couldn‚Äôt get to the balcony which I like to get up early and sit on. Snuck out of the room and went up to the crows nest every morning for coffee and views. Only complaint there was the music played in crows. It‚Äôs awful. 

Food was great. Ate in main dining for dinner every night. Never had a bad meal. Certain dishes better than others but no one complained and didn‚Äôt eat something. I got the uncharged Halibut one night. Wasn‚Äôt my fav. Waiters were very attentive to kids and did their best to bring them their food asap. Little things like that help make vacations. The burger and pizza places were great and when you can order on the app, it‚Äôs so easy. We did lido for breakfast and lunch most days. Tip: go to the ny deli and order bacon egg and cheeses or get eggs any way you want for breakfast. 

Ship was immaculate. Our room steward kept our bomb of a room clean at all times. He def earned a nice tip from us. 

Weather: amazing. We had sun in every port and glacier bay! Every excursion the people led off with ‚Äúyou guys have no idea how lucky you are to see the sun‚Äù. 

We did a whale watch and mendenhall park for Juneau. Port time was a little crappy and made for a long day but we saw at least 15 whales and sealions fighting on a buoy. Skagway we did a chopper to the glacier (no words) and the dog musher camp. I could have done without the dogs but we had kids with us. It was cute for them. Ketchikan we walked around for 2 hours, ate down by the pier and then did the deadliest catch Bering sea. I‚Äôve been on a ton of excursions but this could have been the best one I‚Äôve ever done. If you can get on this, I would do it and not think twice. 

One complaint: the app is awful. We sail carnival a lot and their app is flawless. I don‚Äôt get out the same company can be so different. Getting to your pics is a pain, the WiFi is spotty as hell, it crashes a lot.

The Padres and Dodgers meet again in Petco Park‚ÄôsÈó∑ÁÉ≠ (sweltering) NL West clash, where the only thing hotter than the stakes is the implied probability of the Dodgers (-135) being just 57% favorite. That‚Äôs like betting on your uncle to win a foot race against a tortoise‚Äîslight edge, but still a gamble. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a MLB closer and the humor of aËß£ËØ¥Âëò (play-by-play announcer) who‚Äôs had one too many ballpark hot dogs.

### Parsing the Odds: Why Glasnow‚Äôs ERA is Better Than Your dating Profile

Tyler Glasnow (3.12 ERA, 72 Ks in 57.2 IP) is the Dodger starter, a man who‚Äôs thrown four straight quality starts. Think of him as a reliable old pickup truck: not flashy, but it‚Äôll get you to the store without spilling your milk. Meanwhile, Nestor Cortes (5.87 ERA, 8.6 K/9) is like a leaky faucet‚Äîlots of motion, but not much actual results. His 5.87 ERA is worse than the average office coffee pot‚Äôs ability to stay warm. If Cortes were a pitcher in a video game, he‚Äôd be the one who needs a cheat code just to retire batters.

The total is set at 8 runs, which in today‚Äôs MLB is about as exciting as a rain delay. With both teams‚Äô bullpens as reliable as a Swiss watch (the Padres‚Äô Jason Adam and Dodgers‚Äô Robert Su√°rez have combined for 34 saves), look for a low-scoring dogfight. Bet the Under if you want to feel nostalgic for the days of 1960s baseball.

### Digesting the News: Tatis Jr. is Hot, Cortes is Not

The Padres are riding a four-game win streak, fueled by Fernando Tatis Jr.‚Äôs .306 average and Ramon Laureano‚Äôs recent power surge (3 HRs in 10 games). Tatis is the human equivalent of a fire alarm‚Äîunignorable and always making an entrance. The Padres‚Äô 21-12 second-half record?

If this flash freezing or whatever method of coffee you just then put in hot water is great at keeping tastes consistent and can last for a long time..... why isn't more coffee sold this like? Seems like a great way to taste beans how producers would want them to be tasted, without worrying about expensive equipment or technique when making the coffee. Is it just too expensive for your daily driver?

And also, as someone who cannot explain and doesn't understand the flavors they like in coffee, are there any other ways I can be guided through this process, to compare what bitter coffee tastes like compared to sour etc. Cos I don't have a clue at the moment.

I recently switched from a fresh light roast to a fresh dark roast and have been having some issues with my espresso and my machine. My shots have pulled extremely thin, so I have adjusted my grind size finer to try to add some more resistance. I have tried four different finer settings and I am still having the same results, with no progress. 

I also had something really strange happen the time I used my machine prior to this shot. I did everything as I usually do, put 20g in, tried the finer grind size, and when I pressed the button of my machine, as it started to get going the portafilter started to vibrate so strongly it rotated on to the left on its own as if I was twisting it off and water started to spurt out of the top of the basket. It was all happening so fast and so aggressively, I just pulled the portafilter off because I was afraid the pressure was going to build so much, that it was going to break the machine. I have a Breville Bambino Plus and Baratza Encore ESP and prior to switching beans I had felt that the vibration of the machine sounded different, but wasn‚Äôt entirely sure. 

When I pulled a water shot to try to see what made that issue happen, I noticed the water didn‚Äôt come down in the three distinct streams it used and just gently trickles out of all of the little holes of the I have messed with the grind size and have even tried changing how much coffee I put into the shot (ranging from 18-20g).

At first I was feeling sluggish and tired through the morning and was hard to sit through a screen in the morning. However i realized that following these caffeine tips improved my mental significantly.
- Fasting the first four hours of my day 
- drinking water on an empty stomach 
- Drinking black coffee or caffeine that has no sugar.
- tracking my caffeine intake and following the proper cut off time (2pm for me)

It will drain the life out of you and I feel like half my former self. I had a consultation with my gastroenterologist and due to my worry he did a colonoscopy to ease my mind even though he was telling me that everything sounded like SIBO. Been having really weird bowel movements which got better when I started increasing my fiber but then the bloating doubled. Lot of built up gas and odd belly feelings. I just don't have as much energy and eating just isn't the same anymore. I feel like I have to slow down eating and can't indulge on anything really. This all started after the holidays the beginning of the year I did a 2 day fast. Nothing but water and coffee. I was dumb and ate a huge meal after my fast lol. The next day my gut just started going crazy. Did the crazy gi problem for like a month and I got bronchitis. I was given a antibiotic and for some reason it made my gut feelings better. But when the antibiotic was done the gut problems came back in full force. So here I am today can't wait to talk with the doctor about any ideas of where to go from here. ,1,1755990849.0,SIBO,0,0.6,False

I know Ireland has a pretty storied history between the Vikings invading, the famine, and then the Troubles.


I always take a book with me to read and scribble nerds in about my travels and for this one I'm planning to take a copy of Daughter of the Forest.

1myfxpy,https://letteragegame.com/,New Word Game: Letterage,"A friend of mine has come up with a new on-line word game that seems to me to be pretty fun. I'll give the you the description from the announcement he sent out a few days ago:

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

You start with a set of 7 letters. Make a word, ideally **using some letters more than once**. That‚Äôs how you score big: for example, COFFEE is worth 8 points, TEAMMATE is 12, but DONUT is just 5.

The letters you play will be replaced with new ones from today‚Äôs predetermined sequence, until it runs out. Here is a [short video](https://click-346679.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=69615035&msgid=961919&act=MULQ&c=346679&pid=5112816&destination=https%3A%2F%2Fletteragegame.com%2Fvideo%2FLetterage.mp4&cf=121084&v=9121116fb63ae363ac111f81efd6a35c0ae5f52f32c922bba6d8fb5753ef2ed8).

Your goal is to squeeze the highest score you can out of today‚Äôs challenge. You can also play it again, making different choices, to beat your earlier score.

It‚Äôs free, fresh every day, and just enough of a mental workout to leave you smiling (or muttering about that one word you should have seen).

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I know, from the discussions that we've had as he was developing it, that he has spent a huge amount of time working on the algorithms to ensure that the letter sets that loaded up each day have a maximum amount of playability.

The game runs in two modes: one with a short list of 30 letters, and one with the ""regular' list of 60 letters. Personally, I find the shorter game a good fit for my attention span. If you didn't pick up on it from the description, the letter lists are updated each day, so you get two games a day, one short and one long.

I think it's worth a try.

I'm looking at beginning a coffee mead, but just wondering which yeast would be best used. I have Lalvin 71B at the moment but as this doubles as a more fruity wine yeast I'm not sure if it would still be suitable for a coffee mead. The recipe is as follows:

1.5kg Honey, 190g medium roast coffee beans, vanilla extract, water filled to 1 gallon.

  
Any input on recipe would also be appreciated, but primarily interested in yeast suitability.
