1n8b7wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1n8b7wl/moving_past_being_walked_out_on_in_nashville/,moving past being walked out on in Nashville,"I (22 Male) was walked out on by a girl in Nashville that I was friends with for over two years. For background context, I took a friend of mine to Nashville a few weeks ago for a weekend getaway for free. She didn't have to pay for her flight or hotel. The reasoning for this trip was to do something nice for a person who was going through a difficult time in life, and I experienced something similar that she was going through earlier in my life.

I was friends with this girl for two years and I did a lot of nice things for including taking her to concerts, flying down to see her, and sending her flowers. Given recent events happening in her life, I decided to include her in this trip. I flew into Nashville Thursday afternoon and was having fun until she arrived Friday morning. She got to the hotel Friday morning, and I got her a coffee. Everything was fine during the day on Friday, we saw many of the tourist sites, grabbed food, and drinks. Later, we got to the hotel to get ready to go out for the night, and everything was going great still. We got onto a Broadway rooftop bar, and shortly we left. That's when I noticed something was off with her vibe and energy. I first thought she was tired from an early morning flight and lots of walking... but it didn't get better. She was fun, smiling, and flirty all day. We took a lot of pictures and we laughed together, so the 180 in the mood has left me questioning what could have happened.

We woke up on Saturday morning, and I thought things would get better after getting sleep, but I was wrong. We spent part of Saturday at more local shops and tourist attractions. Early in the day, I walked her to a spot to talk and asked her Did I do or say something to upset you... She replied no, this is why I was hesitant about coming. I didn't wanna ruin your trip. I replied, ""You're not. I wanted you to come"". I gave her three ideas of something to do, and I said, Let's do the party bus since last time I was here, I didn't get to do it, and it would be fun. She was on board with the idea, and when I went to buy tickets, she said You go, I don't wanna ruin this for you. We will meet up later. I was hurt but decided to respect her wishes. I went on the party bus and had fun. When the bus wrapped up, I texted her that I was on my way back to the hotel, and when I got back to the room, all her stuff was gone, and she didn't text or leave a note telling me she was leaving. After sending her multiple texts, I finally got a reply saying, ""I'm fine and safe, I just need space, please respect that, and I don't reach out anymore.""

The next day, I ran into her at the airport and felt blindsided, and she didn't really tell me anything.

When I said this trip meant a lot to me, and you kinda ruined it, she said, ""Give it time and you'll get over it,"" and then I said all those nice things over the years, she just said, ""Well, I appreciate it""

I'm searching for closure and trying to move past this. She recently went on to block me on Instagram and unadd me on Snapchat. Do I send a text to her basically saying the feeling is mutual and don't reach back out? I was there for her in difficult times and did a lot of nice things for her, like previously stated. How do I move past this?",1,1756994993.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

Each department has only one employee, but when there's a lot of work, our boss brings in part-time employees to help out. On regular days, we usually switch between departments and help each other out when needed.

Also‚Äîthis will be important later‚Äîour boss likes to play with the law when it comes to paying us. He always manages to find some loophole so that government programs cover part of our wages. Of course, that comes with certain obligations on his part, but he usually just ignores them. He also thinks he's way smarter than the rest of us and assumes we don‚Äôt know that he‚Äôs violating our rights.

A few former employees decided not to hassle with him and not to press charges even though they had every right. That also gave him ""wings"" to feel more untouchable, big boss vibes. 

Everything was going as ‚Äúfine‚Äù as it could until the boss hired his pet employee. TBH, I genuinely think she might have some kind of learning disability because this woman cannot multiply 2 and 2‚Äîlet alone figure out the job.
But as it usually goes, she hangs out with the boss and his close friends on weekends and so on.

That wouldn‚Äôt even be a problem if she helped at all‚Äîbut she doesn‚Äôt. She mostly drinks coffee and talks on the phone. Every time she‚Äôs given a task (which she never finishes), we have to pick up the slack. And if we don‚Äôt, we get the boss‚Äôs rage.
It‚Äôs frustrating.

But here comes the fun part.

Since my colleagues and I are on good terms with the part-time employees and a few former ones, we decided to have a little fun. Every time the boss‚Äôs pet is in the room with us, we casually talk about how we all hung out last night, get a call from former employee during the shift and put it on speaker, mention something from our (non-existent) WhatsApp group, throw around a few laws that are being broken‚Äîjust whatever pops into our heads.

Every time, the pet runs to the boss and tells him everything we said‚Äîeven the stuff that‚Äôs so dumb my 10-year-old wouldn‚Äôt believe it.

Turns out the boss has been reaching out to his friends trying to figure out what‚Äôs in our imaginary WhatsApp chat and who is involved.
Also, since he‚Äôs scared we‚Äôre planning a collective lawsuit, he‚Äôs been quietly improving our working conditions.

Two of us are currently job-hunting, but it‚Äôs honestly hilarious watching them panic and not being able to say anything directly to us.

Well, I guess the pet shouldn't be eavesdropping on other people‚Äôs conversations. üòå",3,1756994860.0,coworkerstories,0,1.0,False

Normally this would be like a good thing and it'd be a chance for us to reunite since we haven't spoken in YEARS,  but there's a reason for that. We went to different middleschools and I heard from other friends at the time that he became kind of...weird. Apparently he was super homophobic and ""came out"" as transphobic (kinda funny but not rlly), but I don't know what his views are now. I'm really curious and considering going, there's a chance he doesn't recognize me (I'm delusional I know) but I also just don't want to cause a scene? I don't know my mind is jumbled and I feel like there's an opportunity here but I don't know what. Anyways I had to write this somewhere and think about it a bit.

1n8b32t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1n8b32t/dont_be_afraid_to_go_techfree/,Don't be afraid to go tech-free,"I made a post over the summer questioning whether I should make my classroom a tech-free space. There was a lot of debate (when don't we like to hear ourselves talk?) and the biggest issue people kept circling around was that I would be ""outing"" students who have an accommodation. I landed in the brain space that while I am certainly not going to announce one students accommodations to other students, I am also not obligated to build my course in a way that makes their accommodations invisible either. After all, every time an exam rolls around, 3-5 people are missing from a room of 20-30 students. They've outed themselves by going to the testing center, and no one has ever suggested I should make a fake test for them so they can sit in class with everyone else too. I decided that I should make pedagogical decisions based on what is best for the student body as a whole. If a student needs an accommodation to level that playing field, what's what accommodations are for - they can have tech. 

The syllabus policy reads like this: No technology may be used in class without explicit permission. This includes cell phones, ear buds, tablets, and laptop computers. Devices need to be fully put away under your desk. Use of technology during class will first result in you being asked to put away your device. Continued use of technology will result in you being asked to leave class. Your work for the day will not be counted. If you have an accommodation requiring technology, please let me know. If you do not have an accommodation but have a need for tech on a regular basis (e.g., notetaking, caregiver needs), visit office hours to discuss it further and receive permission. If you have an unexpected issue requiring you to monitor your technology on a given day (e.g., a family crisis), please let me know before class starts.

Here's how the roll-out went:  The semester started in late August. The accommodation letters started appearing in my inbox in mid August. I took the time to reply to each student with a generic, ""Hi, I wanted to reach out before the semester to tell you how your accommodations might fit with this class. Feel free to email back or stop by in the first week of classes to discuss more!"" and then I went through each accommodation point-by-point.  For example, two of my classes (seminars) have no exams, so if the student had the ""Extended time"" or the ""Testing in a distraction-free environment"" accommodations, I noted under that line that there are no exams for this class, so they wouldn't use that accommodation. I do in-class five minute quizzes, so for classes with that I explained that they could go to the testing center for 7.5 minutes and a quiet space, but that it would likely interfere with their learning, then I told them what I've done to ensure that the quizzes aren't an extra challenge for those with accommodations (5 questions only, short question text, MC or fill-in-one-word only). No one chose to go to the testing center. As expected, many had ""Tech for notetaking"" accommodations.  Under that I noted that this was a Tech-free classroom, and I copied the syllabus policy for them. To that, I added that since this is in their letter, of course they have permission to use a laptop or tablet for note-taking purposes only (no phones) and that at any point in the semester I could ask to see their notes to ensure that their tech use is appropriate. 

It was amazing. Multiple students emailed back thanking me for caring/reaching out. No one complained or raised an issue. One student emailed back saying she would need tech for a quiz if the class quiz involved writing than a sentence (my one class with more vague pre-quizzes). I said no worries, how about you sit where I can see your screen for proctoring purposes, and if we have more free-write style quizzes, you type your response, and you email it to me when I'm collecting the others papers. She said that sounded great.

I announced the policy in all my classes. One student tried to raise their hand immediately and I was like hang on, let me explain this. You're adults - if you feel you need a laptop or tablet to take notes, you just have to come to office hours and talk to me to get it pre-approved, and I'll ask to see your notes periodically to ensure they match up with your typing activity. If you need a phone regularly for things like insulin monitoring, please just let me know so that it's pre-approved and I don't call you out. If you need a phone for a one-time emergency, like a family member in the hospital, let me know you're going to leave it on your desk that day.  If you need a phone because you're a primary caregiver, let me know in advance and put it on vibrate. Someone calls, you can step out into the hall to answer it. I added that I would have my phone with me, and I'd check my watch if someone called. I told them I would typically continue to lecture, but if it was my kids school or my elderly parents, I might need to pause and step into the hall, because I am a caregiver in both directions.  The one hand went down and all students looked fine (general nodding, no frustrated or confused faces). The students with accommodations didn't ask questions, maybe because of my advance email. 

It's been a couple weeks and my guys, zero students have approached me to ask for tech use. **Zero**! I have over 100 students this semester across my classes. I had multiple students with accommodations, but only one is choosing to use a laptop. The other students in the room do not seem at all disturbed to see her with her laptop out. Since I know who the others with accommodations are, I'll probably reach out via email in another week or two to the others and reaffirm that they can use tech if they need it, as long as I can check their notes, and see how they're feeling about their note-taking. That will give them an opportunity to talk to me privately without having to approach, and make them feel like I care about them (which I do, of course). In my experience, most of classroom management at this level is just making them think we care and explaining the reasons for our pedagogical choice. Once they see it's all to enhance their learning experience, they usually buy-in.

I'm teaching a broad range of courses this semester, but I walked into an upper-level seminar on day 2 of the semester and the students were already discussing the reading. I was floored. Like, don't let me interrupt you. I walked into a first-year seminar yesterday and it was party-level loud - they'd moved the wheelie desks around and were having a good time. I walked through a critical thinking exercise for the next 50 minutes and many of them participated - no hands, just speaking up and contributing. That material can totally bomb, but they were bought in and having a good time with it. One student at the end was like, ""I read this cool thing online; well, I haven't critically evaluated it, so I don't know if it's true, but ..."" - I wanted to cry. Feeding into this particular class: it's a welcome-to-college/the major class, so I had also assigned them to go out in person with 1 or more people the prior week to a public, on-campus place, have a coffee or a meal, have a nice chat and then write it up into an informal essay, and I gave them a series of questions designed to build relationships (RCIT; Sedikides et al., 1999) to guide their chat. I also asked for a selfie of the pair/group to prove attendance and also to help me match names to faces. Certainly that built community (reading their essays many didn't want to do it, but all thought it was a valuable experience after doing it). I'm also guessing coming into class the following week and not being able to get on their tech helped them though. In the past when I've taught this class I've done this assignment and still walked in the next day to silent classes staring at their phones. This is such a refreshing change. 

Tech-free FTW! I'm never going back :-)   To help put this in context: I'm tenured at a liberal-arts institution with smaller class sizes and strong academic freedom (unions baby). Mileage may vary in other settings.",3,1756994723.0,Professors,1,1.0,False

The small fishing villages with colorful houses clinging to the cliffs attract visitors from every corner of the world. The popularity of this destination often makes accommodation scarce and expensive, especially during warmer months. For travelers who want a calmer base with reasonable rates, **Albergo La Spezia** offers an appealing option.

This countryside hotel is around thirty minutes by car from Cinque Terre National Park. It offers the comfort of modern rooms, a quiet location, and easy connections to the coast, while avoiding the stress and high prices that come with staying inside the villages themselves.

# A Location Between Tuscany and Liguria

Albergo La Spezia has a setting that blends two regions. It sits between Liguria and Tuscany, making it possible to explore far more than just the Cinque Terre.

* **Cinque Terre:** The villages of Monterosso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola, and Riomaggiore are within half an hour by car or by train. Guests can enjoy the coastal walks and return later to a quiet countryside setting.
* **La Spezia:** The town is only ten minutes away by car. Here visitors will find a lively port, shopping streets, fresh seafood restaurants, and the train station with direct routes to the Cinque Terre, Pisa, and Genoa.
* **Tuscany:** Driving south opens the door to Tuscany‚Äôs northern treasures. Within an hour, you can visit Carrara with its marble quarries, the sandy beaches near Viareggio, or the historic town of Lucca.

This position gives travelers more flexibility than staying directly inside the Cinque Terre, where access to wider attractions is limited.

# Country Surroundings and Everyday Comfort

The hotel is surrounded by hills, offering a refreshing change of pace from the crowded coast. Guests can relax on the **Jasmin Terrace**, which looks out towards the mountains. It is a place where you can take a pause, enjoy the views, or share a quiet drink after a long day.

Inside, the focus is on comfort without unnecessary extras.

* Rooms are simple, clean, and set up to suit both budget travelers and guests who prefer more privacy.
* Options are available with either private or shared bathrooms.
* Every room has a flat-screen television for relaxing in the evening.
* Wi-Fi is available throughout the property for planning trips or keeping in touch with family.

The balance between rural surroundings and practical services makes the stay comfortable and relaxed.

# Access to Shops, Transport, and Roads

Although Albergo La Spezia sits outside the city, guests do not lose access to everyday needs.

* **Shops and Restaurants:** Within walking distance are supermarkets and local eateries where visitors can taste Ligurian dishes at local prices.
* **Public Transport:** A bus stop just 100 meters away provides direct service to **La Spezia train station**, the main link for reaching the Cinque Terre.
* **By Car:** The hotel is located only three kilometers from the **A12/A15 motorway exit**, making regional travel simple. Free private parking on site removes the worry of finding a space.

This combination makes the hotel practical both for those with a car and those depending on public transport.

# Breakfast Before the Day Begins

A simple breakfast is part of the stay. Coffee, fresh bread, and other morning items are ready before guests set out for their day. Many travelers appreciate this, as exploring Cinque Terre involves plenty of walking and climbing. Starting the day with a good meal helps prepare for the trails and steps that lie ahead.

# Reasons to Stay Outside the Crowded Zone

Many people first imagine staying inside one of the Cinque Terre villages. However, Albergo La Spezia offers several clear advantages.

1. **Lower Costs:** Rooms in the villages are often priced very high. Staying outside means more reasonable rates.
2. **Quieter Nights:** After long days in crowded streets, returning to a calm countryside setting feels restful.
3. **Local Flavor:** Shops and restaurants around La Spezia‚Äôs outskirts are frequented by residents rather than tourists, offering a more genuine taste of the region.
4. **Broader Travel Options:** With both Tuscany and Liguria within reach, guests can extend their trip beyond the Cinque Terre.

For many travelers, these points create a more balanced experience.

# Things to Do Nearby

The hotel‚Äôs location provides a base for more than just the famous five villages.

* **Walking Trails:** The Ligurian hills around the hotel are filled with paths that are less crowded than the Cinque Terre trails.
* **Coastal Spots:** Beaches near Lerici and Fiascherino offer swimming and relaxation away from the busiest areas.
* **Cultural Visits:** La Spezia itself has museums, art galleries, and seasonal events that highlight local life.
* **Wine and Food:** Both Liguria and Tuscany are home to vineyards. Visitors can enjoy wine tastings or try traditional dishes prepared with regional products.

The mix of coast, countryside, and culture makes it easy to fill a trip with variety.

# Guest Impressions

Travelers often describe Albergo La Spezia as simple but welcoming. Guests appreciate the friendly atmosphere, the cleanliness of the rooms, and the straightforward comfort that the hotel provides. The convenience of transport links and free parking also stand out as benefits.

This type of experience suits visitors who prefer a genuine stay rather than a tourist-heavy environment.

# A Practical Base Near Cinque Terre

Visiting the Cinque Terre is a special experience, but accommodation plays a major role in how enjoyable the trip feels. **Albergo La Spezia** gives travelers an alternative to the busy and costly seaside villages.

The countryside location with mountain views, the Jasmin Terrace, the proximity to both Liguria and Tuscany, and the ease of access to roads and trains all make it a practical choice. Shops and restaurants nearby keep daily needs simple, while breakfast and free parking add comfort.

Whether the plan is to walk the coastal trails, explore Tuscan towns, or spend quiet evenings in the hills, Albergo La Spezia provides a calm and convenient base for exploring northern Italy.",1,1756994694.0,ALBERGOLASPEZIA,0,1.0,False

1n8b0r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1n8b0r9/saw_this_cbc_canada_news_reporting_about_a_17/,Saw this CBC (Canada) news reporting about a 17 years old Ahmed (celiac disease) struggling to survive hunger in Gaza.,"First let me say this phrase ""struggling to survive hunger in Gaza"" was in the CBC youtube description. I am just copying and pasting the phrase used by CBC.  

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu2qqlHT-zA (youtube)

Cutting through all the ""noise"", I find this news reporting surprisingly balanced. 

1. Unlike previous New York Times reporting, CBC fully disclosed Ahmed aged 17 had celiac disease (i.e. It is an autoimmune condition. He cant eat gluten). CBC did not hide his underlying autoimmune condition. As it should be expected of journalists.

2. You can see they have access to some food, one meal a day, but insufficient (calories). He has two other brothers, unlike Ahmed they dont have celiac disease, they are a stark contrast from Ahmed who appears significantly weaker. It appears that the insufficient food is mostly affecting people with underlying medical conditions and most vulnerable first. People with pre-existing health issues, people requiring specific diets, specialized food, specialized milk formulae, etc... it is not affecting everyone equally. 

3. Notice in the video, the video is trying to tell a story,  when Ahmed mum showed pictures of him before the war... Meet Mohamed El Saife, https://www.instagram.com/mohamed_elsaife/?hl=en the freelance videographer doing the interview in Gaz for CBC. As a Gazan journalists he is probably biased. You will see he guided Ahmed, hey take off your shirt so we can see how skinny you are... it will be good for the video etc...(nothing particularly wrong with that, after all the story is about starvation in Gaza), just know not everything is organic and natural. This is important, CBC narrator override the Gaza journalist and included information of his celiac disease. CBC did not allow the Gaza videographer to push the story, CBC retained editorial.

4. Idk why Ahmed's body could ""not absorb"" anything.  That's what he said. I checked that lentils and rice are gluten free food. I am no medical expert. We meet his doctor from Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City (they have electricity, his PC is working, it has lights) His doctor says he needs nutritious food (presumably food he used to have, chicken, eggs, fresh vegetables etc... a healthy diet, not just rice and lentils). The GHF food package (dry food) will be insufficient, it has to be supplemented with fresh food for a healthy diet.

5. Now que in the Doctor from London. He thinks there is famine (not in the entire Gaza city or in entire Gaza strip). He says famine is in pockets of neighborhood in Gaza City. Now you wont hear this from doctors in Gaza or Gaza journalists. There are big inequities in Gaza, they are people who have money and have food while others dont have money and dont have food. There is a distribution problem, the most vulnerable, the poor are finding it hard to survive and find food, the rich, well connected are eating pizza. 

6. Ahmed, 17 passed away, suffering from malnutrition. The video ended with his mother cursing anyone who was able to help and didnt. I heard of his curse before, it is usually directed at Arab nations. Many Gazans felt betrayed by Arab countries (Arab brothers and sisters), the Muslim ummah, etc.  they felt Arab nations are not doing enough to help Gaza. Usually in interviews with Gazans in Arabic, they just direct that curse at Arab nations.  

7. The journalist in Gaza only provided half of the story. The other half of the story came from Israel, London and Canada. Together, you get a fuller, more complete better picture. Sometimes both can be true at the same time. Rich Gazans eating Pizza, drinking coffee at beach front cafes, etc... and poor and vulnerable Gazans are starving. Pro-Palestinian will push one narrative everyone 2m is starving. Pro-Israrl/ Netanyahu will push another extreme, there are no hunger, they are eating pizzas. The truth lies somewhere between these two extremes.

Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm Minjung from Seoul, and I‚Äôve been working on a small project to connect locals and travelers through cultural walks and casual conversations.‚ò∫Ô∏è

It‚Äôs small (3‚Äì5 people), friendly, and open to anyone curious about Korean culture, art, or simply meeting new people. Our next gathering is on this Sunday, September 7th (11 AM ‚Äì 1 PM or 3 ‚Äì 5 PM). 

‚ú® Brief Plan for this gathering:

- Meet at Gwanghwamun Gate

- Walk down Gallery Street, chatting about art and culture in a relaxed way.

- Look around the exhibition at National Museum of Art 

- Wrap up in Samcheong-dong Cultural Street, with deeper conversations over coffee!

I‚Äôve been hosting these small meetups privately since last year, but now I‚Äôd love to open them up, meet more people, and hopefully grow it into a business someday üëÄ If you‚Äôd like to give it a try, you‚Äôre more than welcome!

In this world, in my life, now, I can with a couple of clicks buy a plane ticket and go to almost anywhere. I also have the money to it. 
In the difficult parts of the world, just for the price of that ticket some people would be really really happy, as that money would be enough to feed them for a year. 
I won't take that plane. And I won't give my money, I'm saving to try to get a house in the not so bad part of the world. But not only that, I'm also buying coffee, going on vacations, buying entertainment. 
What percentage of my money goes to help others? Not so much, houses are really expensive. And to be honest, even if I had a house, I probably wouldn't give much, most people don't give much either. 

We like to complain about rich people but we are rich people compared to many. I'd say the majority of the population evades this truth: you could be saving life's, but you are choosing other things, just like you choose to see a kitten in a meme instead of focusing in seeing Gaza genocide, or things like that... Not like seeing if would change anything anyway right? 

We were told and educated in this world as a world where people care about each other and are generally good. In reality, even in the good part of the world, you can see it clearly: nobody gives a fuck about those around them. And not you either, this world is fucking really cold, and you have enough with  your shit, you know that you either take care of you or nobody will come to save you, and you better compete well, because being nice won't take you anything but people taking advantage of it, and, at best, a smile. 

So, how do you cope with it? And why do we educate our children teaching them so enormous big lies? Getting to be an adult an seeing how fake it was is difficult now. ",3,1756994204.0,Ethics,1,0.8,False

Just want to restate I've already watched this and this is a rewatch and yes I know in [this post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/boyslove/comments/1luxteh/a_show_you_loved_but_will_never_watch_again/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)I said I wouldn't watch it again but....I had to lol I was trying to see something. With that being said we'll jump into it! 

**HIStory 3: Make Our Days Count:**

Let's start at the beginning. I feel like this was a good example of opposites attract. XHT and YXG could not be more different. Honestly both couples had that dynamic and it ultimately worked. 

Also I love to see a locked in character. Once XHT realized he loved YXG he was NOT LETTING UP. ALL THE WAY LOCKED IN. He did not play about his baby at ALL. We love to see it....but this also made the conclusion hurt even more....especially because YXG really suffered. 

In terms of the second couple, won't lie, I had some trouble with it on first watch. Taiwan likes to test me with their moral greyness lol. But that's why I like them. They tiptoe on that line and ultimately I loved them. Their story was REAL complicated but interesting. Sun was an idiot lol but an idiot in LOVE and once he was finally grounded it was all good.

**2nd watch noticings:**

\- the dynamics of XHT's family cracked me up. The dad was running around trying to hit him with his shoes and his mom and sister were chilling on the couch eating fruit like it was a regular Tuesday lol

\- I feel like everybody moved and acted like their ages.  From the conversations to the actions to the beef it all felt very grounded in reality. 

\- We found out episode 1 that LC thought that for Sun's age he was quick to be interested in something and then quick to change his mind. This was really the main hurdle for this couple because of Lu Chigang's baggage. He never thought to take him seriously. 

Also COMPLETELY forgot that Sun kissed him in the second episode lol. Dude would have moments of being mature and then would throw caution to the wind. Teenager shit. He did NOT know how to deal with his building emotions throughout the show. Luckily LC could meet him where he was especially because we found out with him that nobody has truly chosen him. 

\- On first watch I really saw XHT as a straight up bully but on second watch I realized it wasn't so much that. He was a selfish, goofball, slacker. He did not think his pranks would be that big of a deal and I don't think he did anything with malicious intentions. 

At that age kids do dumb shit to entertain and get ""street cred"" from their friends and that was him to a T. He didn't care about being hit with shoes, getting low grades or kneeling. To him he was just playing around and it wasn't that serious. But once he saw the effect it had on YXG it was a wrap for that. He immediately realized that life is NOT a game for everybody and can have real consequences. *Sadly ironic.* 

*-* LC (coffee shop manager) was apparently related to the idol from HIStory 1 Stay Away From Me. WHO KNEW! That was a callback I was not expecting! 

In terms of technical elements, I feel like this was the best I've seen so far. Closest would be HIStory 2: Crossing the Line. The acting, dialogue, storyline, even simple things like showing someone poor and someone from a well-to-do household was portrayed perfectly. 

**As for the ending.....**

I was only 8 minutes in and LAWD. The way the signs were ALL there from the beginning. Like they honestly breadcrumbed it throughout the series but I think things were just building so good and most BL fans just aren't used to or fond of sad/tragic endings that no one thought it would go there. Tbh I didn't think it would either. 

A lot of people told me not to watch the final episode (which was never going to happen) and I thought yall were just being dramatic. But I did NOT expect for it to end that way AT ALL. I think I just sat there in shock the entire last episode but then I remembered the title: **MAKE OUR DAYS COUNT.** 

From the beginning of the series to the end we were counting down and every moment was more precious than we or the characters thought. And honestly I'm glad I didn't have any straightforward spoilers because it would not have hit the same. 

On second watch, I was prepared and yet....it still hit like a ton of bricks. They had a rocky start and right when things were getting good there was the issue with XGT's family then we got past that and everything was snatched right from under us. Grief is always a difficult topic. 

All in all. My opinion really hasn't changed. I still haven't watched 4 or 5 yet but I feel like this is the best in this series. For me, stories that really connect me to the characters in a way where I am emotionally affected are the best and always will be. And this is one of them. I gave this series a **9/10.**",9,1756994188.0,boyslove,2,1.0,False

Have I have an opportunity for you to get on the ground floor of this adventure. I‚Äôm a SWM no kids. I‚Äôm looking for someone who wants to build something that can be lasting. I‚Äôm not gonna lie I have a dad bod I‚Äôm pudgy. But am active in blazing the trails of central Iowa on a bike or finding a state park to walk around or some adventure that keeps me active and outside. I spent a large part of my life as a couch potato and chasing a career I forgot to live my life. I want to change that and I want to be something more. 

Outside of being active I brew beer, nitro coffee, I like to write, read, drive a lot so podcast and audio books are a go too. I love conversation and learning from people. I‚Äôm not college educated but I am a deep thinker and in ways a dreamer. 

Who I am looking for I honestly don‚Äôt know. Someone that can stimulate my mind. I don‚Äôt need a perfect person. Because let‚Äôs get serious we all have flaws and imperfections the goal is to find if those imperfections match our imperfections. I am a believer on strong foundations and building upon that. I am a guy and physical attraction is a must as it is for you. We are all adults and we can all agree that if the eye test isn‚Äôt passed you could have the greatest personality but it‚Äôs not gonna hold up. I want someone who takes care of themselves and I‚Äôm all for someone who is on a journey to better health and a better life. 

So if I sound like someone you want to talk to shoot me a message let‚Äôs talk and let‚Äôs see where it goes. Hope I talk to you soon. ",0,1756993360.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

Building positive habits is one of the most important pillars of personal development. Habits shape our routines, influence our decisions, and, in the long run, determine the kind of life we live. While motivation can be temporary, habits create consistency, build discipline, and make change sustainable.

But if habits are so powerful, why do so many people fail to create and maintain them? The answer lies in *how* they are formed. Many people expect immediate results, but lasting habits require strategy, patience, and above all, self-awareness.

In this article, we‚Äôll explore how to form positive habits that stick for life, bringing more productivity, well-being, and balance.

# Why Habits Matter So Much

Habits are automatic behaviors that we repeat without much conscious thought. Imagine if every day you had to stop and decide whether to brush your teeth, take a shower, or lock the door when leaving home. That would be exhausting.

The brain creates habits to save energy. They allow us to focus on more complex matters while routine actions run on autopilot. This means that if you train your mind to build positive habits, they will naturally become part of your life.

The flip side is that negative habits follow the same mechanism. Eating fast food, procrastinating, or spending hours scrolling on social media are also automated behaviors that can be tough to change.

# The Habit Loop: How It Works

Before learning how to create new habits, it‚Äôs important to understand how they are formed. Author Charles Duhigg, in his book *The Power of Habit*, explains the loop in three stages:

1. **Cue (trigger):** the signal that sparks the habit, such as time of day, location, or emotion.
2. **Routine (action):** the behavior itself.
3. **Reward:** the immediate benefit that reinforces the habit and makes the brain want to repeat it.

Example:

* **Cue:** feeling stressed after work.
* **Routine:** ordering fast food.
* **Reward:** sense of relief and convenience.

The secret to building lasting habits is to adjust this cycle strategically, replacing harmful routines with behaviors that provide better outcomes.

# Step 1: Start Small

A common mistake when creating new habits is starting with big, unrealistic goals. For someone who has never exercised, committing to an hour at the gym every day is likely unsustainable.

The key is to **start small**. If your goal is to read more, begin with five minutes a day. If you want to exercise, try a 10-minute walk. These small steps may seem insignificant, but they create consistency ‚Äî and consistency is what transforms small actions into long-term habits.

üí° Practical tip: set goals so small they‚Äôre nearly impossible to fail.

# Step 2: Use Clear Triggers

No habit forms without a trigger. Linking new behaviors to existing ones helps the brain adopt them more naturally.

Examples:

* After brushing your teeth ‚Üí practice 5 minutes of meditation.
* After breakfast ‚Üí write down 3 things you‚Äôre grateful for.
* After shutting down your work computer ‚Üí put on workout clothes.

By creating a clear ‚Äúanchor,‚Äù the habit finds its natural place in your day.

# Step 3: Make the Habit Attractive

No one sticks with a habit that feels like punishment. It must feel enjoyable ‚Äî or at least be tied to a small, immediate reward.

For instance, if your goal is to exercise, choose an activity you actually enjoy, like dancing or cycling. If your goal is to read, start with lighter, engaging books rather than dense, technical ones.

You can also pair the habit with something you enjoy: listen to your favorite music while walking, or sip a good coffee while reading.

# Step 4: Shape Your Environment

Your surroundings heavily influence your behaviors. If you want to eat healthier but your kitchen is full of junk food, the odds of success drop.

On the other hand, keeping fresh fruit visible and organizing healthy snacks makes good choices easier.

The same principle applies elsewhere:

* Want to read more? Leave a book on your nightstand.
* Want less screen time? Turn off notifications or keep your phone in another room.
* Want to write daily? Keep a notebook within reach.

# Step 5: Be Consistent and Patient

Some claim it takes 21 days to form a habit, but studies show the real range is 18 to 254 days, depending on the complexity of the behavior. That means patience is crucial.

Don‚Äôt give up if you miss a day. Perfection isn‚Äôt the goal ‚Äî consistency is. If you skip today, just get back on track tomorrow. Over time, the habit will naturally embed itself into your life.

# Step 6: Try Habit Stacking

‚ÄúHabit stacking‚Äù means attaching a new habit to one you already do automatically.

Examples:

* You already brush your teeth every day ‚Üí add 5 minutes of stretching afterward.
* You already eat breakfast ‚Üí review your to-do list right after.

This method works because the new habit ‚Äúpiggybacks‚Äù on an existing one.

# Step 7: Track Your Progress

Recording your progress builds motivation. Use a calendar, app, or notebook to mark the days you complete your habit.

Seeing progress visually creates a sense of accomplishment and drives you to keep going. Many call this strategy ‚Äúdon‚Äôt break the chain.‚Äù

# Step 8: Replace Negative Habits

Sometimes it‚Äôs not enough to just add good habits; you also need to replace harmful ones. Negative behaviors take up time and energy that could be used for positive growth.

Examples:

* Swap the habit of checking social media first thing in the morning for reading an inspiring quote.
* Replace processed snacks with natural options like fruit or nuts.

# Step 9: Rely on Social Support

Sharing your goals with friends or family increases accountability. You can even find an accountability partner, like someone to work out with or a book club to join.

Being surrounded by supportive people strengthens motivation and lowers the risk of quitting.

# Step 10: Celebrate Your Wins

Rewarding yourself is essential for solidifying habits. Acknowledge your progress at every milestone, no matter how small.

It can be as simple as enjoying a favorite meal, taking a relaxing break, or sharing your achievement with someone close.

Celebration creates positive reinforcement, making you want to continue the behavior.

# How Positive Habits Transform Your Life

Once established, positive habits bring profound change:

* **Better health and energy:** a stronger body and clearer mind.
* **Higher productivity:** focus on tasks that matter.
* **Emotional balance:** practices like meditation and gratitude build resilience.
* **Improved relationships:** habits of listening, empathy, and respect strengthen bonds.
* **Greater self-confidence:** every habit kept reinforces your ability to shape your own life.

# Start Today

Don‚Äôt wait until Monday or the start of a new month. Pick one small habit today and take the first step. Real change begins with simple, consistent actions that eventually lead to extraordinary results.

I felt great despite some skin changes.  I walked everyday for about 30 -45 minutes.  I have arm pain on the radiated side and try to stretch to loosen it up, but some days it is a little debilitating, but I work with it. 

This Tuesday, I hit a wall.  I was exhausted.  I went to bed a work up yesterday with an 87 sleep score (per my Oura ring which I usually find accurate for how I feel) but could barely function.  I worked remotely at a desk but had to keep getting up an sitting/laying on the couch. I could have gone to bed at 4pm I was so tired but I had to feed my family.

It wasn't tired like lack of sleep, just my body was done. 

Today hasn't started out much better despite the large coffee in front of me. 

So, I am wondering, has anyone else experienced late side effects from radiation?  I mean it is a little over 2 months out and I haven't had fatigue at all but can this be from radiation?

something i truly appreciate about today is having a plate full of food for myself and my family. it may feel like a small thing, but when i see people on the streets struggling for a single meal, it really makes me count this blessing.

secondly, my mental health. it might not sound big to many, but for me it took a lot of self-work to reach this place of stability and sanity. and lastly, i went out for coffee alone at a good caf√©‚Äîit felt refreshing in its own simple way.

Y‚Äôall, nobody ever sat me down and explained money to me. I had to bump my head a few times and figure it out the hard way. I‚Äôm sharing this because I want us to win together. We carry so much already.  A little financial literacy should be part of the legacy we leave behind. Here‚Äôs what I wish somebody had told me:

	1.	Pay Yourself First (Automate It) Don‚Äôt wait until the end of the month to save because by then it‚Äôs gone. Have money go straight from your paycheck into savings or investing before it even hits checking. Then live on the rest.

	2.	Build a Peace Fund (HYSA) Start with $1,000, then work up to 3‚Äì6 months of bills. Keep it in a High-Yield Savings Account where it earns more than pennies but is still safe and easy to grab. When life comes at you (and it will), this fund keeps you from swiping credit cards in a panic.

	3.	Invest Early, Even Small (It‚Äôs Simple) 
 DON‚ÄôT BE SCURRED!!!! You don‚Äôt need to be a Wall Street pro to invest in the stock market. Open a free brokerage account at Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. Set up $50 a paycheck on autopilot (increase as you are able), and buy a low-cost index ETF like VOO (S&P 500). If you qualify, open a Roth IRA too, you put in after-tax money now, and later it comes out tax-free. That‚Äôs wealth you keep.

	4.	Grab Free Money at Work (Then Use a Roth) 
If your job matches your retirement contributions (401k, TSP, 403b), take that match first, it‚Äôs free money. After that, put money into a Roth IRA if you‚Äôre eligible. Once that‚Äôs maxed, circle back and add more to your 401k/TSP or the brokerage discussed above.

	5.	Pay Off High-Interest Debt 
Credit cards and payday loans will eat you alive. No other steps will truly matter if all your money is going to 25% interest. Kill the highest-interest debt first while paying minimums on the rest until every card is paid off.  Every payment is like giving yourself a raise.  Also, payday loans are THE DEVIL and a trap.  Please avoid at all costs if you can.  

	6.	Budget and Track Your Spending 
Don‚Äôt fly blind. The big 3 (housing, transportation, food) are what make or break most budgets‚Äînot the Starbucks. So keep those in line. And don‚Äôt stress the little stuff‚Äîif your daily coffee makes you happy, budget for it.

	7.	Protect Your Credit 
Pay on time, keep balances under 30%, and check your credit reports. Good credit makes life cheaper; cars, houses, even insurance. Bad credit makes everything more expensive.

	8.	Protect Yourself with Insurance Health, life, and disability insurance aren‚Äôt optional. One accident or illness can wipe out everything you worked for. Don‚Äôt let one emergency undo years of progress.

	9.	Practice Delayed Gratification Wealth is what you keep, not what you spend. Most people flexing on Instagram are financing the look and their global Jet setting with debt. Stop chasing the Joneses.  The Joneses are broke. Better to BE wealthy than to look wealthy.

	10.	Know Your Net Worth 
Add up what you own, subtract what you owe. That number is your net worth. Track it. Even if you‚Äôre starting negative, seeing it move in the right direction is motivating.

	11.	Grow Your Income 
Sometimes the problem isn‚Äôt your spending, it‚Äôs your paycheck. You can‚Äôt budget your way out of an unlivable salary. Negotiate your pay.  Job hop in a strategic way if you must.  Pick careers with good ROI, get skills that pay, and don‚Äôt go broke chasing degrees that won‚Äôt. And by all means, I‚Äôm pro-degree.  I have 3 of them including a doctorate.  Just make sure you pick the ones that come with a high paying job attached.  And look for low-cost certifications and make smart student loan choices (like PSLF and avoiding private lenders). And don‚Äôt be scared of a side hustle. I make a solid income, and I STILL side gig. More income = more options.

You don‚Äôt have to do all 11 at once. Start with one or two, get consistent, and stack the rest. Wealth is about freedom and choices, not perfection.

And if you‚Äôve got questions, I know I, and others here, would be happy to help. Again, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor. Just an Auntie trying to look out for my nieces and sisters in a way nobody ever did for me.",8,1756992888.0,blackladies,1,1.0,False

I (22) live at home due to the lack of housing and I own a dog. My parent (68F) has her own dog, a puppy.

My small breed dog is obese and has been on a diet for two years now to no success, as my parent doesn't respect the diet and regularly goes against my wishes to feed my dog a lot of dog treats and human food - she even allows this dog to finish her puppy's food when he's had enough. Speaking of the puppy, she has a 5 month old small breed dog and will: try to give him chocolate as a treat (luckily the dog doesn't like it), feeds him onions with meat sometimes and even allows this dog to drink her coffee. She has told me before that she taps his snout to try train him too.

Whenever I remind her that things are toxic she scoffs and tells me all her previous dogs had it so it's fine, when the previous dogs passed under the average lifespan for their breed. The puppy has also started displaying behaviours such as resource guarding. He has not once had a walk in the two months we have had him and she allows him to chew up anything in the house which sometimes includes him bringing in feces from the back garden to eat - she tends not to notice this until it is pointed out to her or until someone else corrects his behaviour.

I don't think this is neglect as such too but with her previous dog, she refused to take her to the vet despite the dog being sickly. The puppy is currently having an issue with his teeth and she refuses to take him to the vet due to the cost.

I'm concerned for the well being of the dogs but fear I can not report her for anything as that would end up with removal of my dog also, we're in the UK if that helps. My only plan of action I am considering is to report her once I finally have a place of my own but I don't know how long that will take.",1,1756992772.0,Advice,2,0.99,False

I shared this project here about two weeks ago ‚Äî and wow, many of you jumped in, tried it, and reported all kinds of interesting bugs. Huge thanks üôå I‚Äôve fixed them all (at least the ones I know of üòÖ) and would love for you to give the app another try.

I've just built a new cycling app that creates great road routes with a single click. The goal? Fun, scenic rides ‚Äî not just the shortest point A to point B.

Link if you are too lazy to read a post! üëâ [https://routecycle.com](https://routecycle.com)

**Here's how it works:**

1. Choose your distance (10‚Äì300 km) and whether it‚Äôs a loop or point-to-point.
2. (Optional) Pick a target elevation gain.
3. (Optional) Add sightseeing stops.
4. (Optional) Include natural springs to refill your bottles.
5. (Optional) Add custom stops along the route ‚Äî for me, that usually means food places.

Hit ""Get Route"" ‚Äî and the magic happens. You get a custom route, ready to ride.

It's free for now. If you like it, you can buy me a coffee, send brutally honest feedback, or even help out.

**Why it‚Äôs different from Komoot/Strava/Garmin/etc**

Most apps still try to give you the *shortest* or *fastest* route from A to B. That works if you know the area really well and can manually spot which roads are actually nice for cycling. But if you don‚Äôt ‚Äî like when you‚Äôre going on a long weekend ride or traveling somewhere new ‚Äî it‚Äôs hard to tell which routes are safe, smooth, and fun.

This app takes the guesswork out. Routes are optimized specifically for road cyclists: less traffic, smoother tarmac, and better scenery. And instead of sending you down the same roads over and over, it also tries to mix things up ‚Äî making your rides more diverse, fun, and full of little discoveries.

**The idea came from two frustrations:**

1. Planning routes is a time sink ‚Äî especially checking traffic, road quality, and sights for a safe, pleasant ride.
2. I love discovering hidden gems while riding. But too often, they're just 100 meters off the path and I miss them. This app helps find them before I do.

If that sounds familiar, you'll probably love it too.

And if you find a critical bug, please report it ‚Äî you'll be my hero.

**Knows issues:**

* Sometimes the route makes unnecessary turns in cities instead of taking the straight road out. It may also leave a main road and then rejoin it ‚Äî this usually happens because the app is trying to avoid traffic.
* The UI on mobile phones isn‚Äôt great yet ‚Äî it works much better on PC. On Android (especially in Firefox), the address field may not work properly.
* Routes and data aren‚Äôt always ideal (it depends a lot on the area). I plan to improve this and add more data sources so routes get better and better with each release.
* Anything else you notice ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to hear about it!

**The future roadmap:**

* Gravel support
* Direct export to Garmin, Strava, and Komoot (GPX download already available)
* Mobile apps
* Your ideas here ‚Äî what would you like to see?

**Try it out and tell me what you think:**

After months of nerve-wracking edits, cover preparation with miblart, and intense bouts of self-doubt, ***She Who Devours the Stars*** (Book 1 of The Astral Mess series) is finally here!

It's a mythpunk space opera following Fern Meldin, a nineteen year old disaster lesbian who goes looking for a one night stand and accidentally bonds with a sentient mythship that's basically a cosmic-level therapy patient with abandonment issues. What follows is sapphic chaos across the galaxy, featuring:

\* Enemies-to-lovers with gravitational force.  
\* A found family of chaotic queers aboard a ship that makes amazing tea and holds grudges.  
\* The Sexretary (yes, it's a real job title in this universe).  
\* Plenty of spice woven into the plot, not just tacked on.  
\* Sharp banter between women who could destroy planets but are too busy flirting.

Perfect for fans of Gideon the Ninth's irreverent tone, The Priory of the Orange Tree's epic scope, or anyone who's ever thought ""you know what space needs? More disaster lesbians making terrible decisions and sexily eating street food.""

Content Notes: Explicit sexual content, some violence, cosmic horror elements, and exploration of identity.

Available now on Kindle Unlimited and paperback:  [https://a.co/d/bCCanHw](https://a.co/d/bCCanHw)

If this sounds like your jam, I'd be over the moon if you checked it out! And if you end up loving Fern's chaotic gay space adventures, reviews help indie debuts like mine find their people.

May your coffee be strong and your space girlfriends emotionally available.

to catch you up on what my post was about: 

I asked for advice on what to do because I had a trip to the UK planned to meet my 2 best friends Amelia and Stacy, whom I planned to go to 2 concerts with. However I was planning to cancel/ call the trip off because of their ongoing fights and arguments between each other, ruining my UK trips that require 2+ hours by plane, and several more hours by train to get to amelia‚Äôs house. after Amelia talked to Stacy behind my back about me thinking about canceling the trip, Stacy flipped out and I was forced to apologize to her when I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.. and now, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be pleased to hear that THE UK TRIP IS OFFICIALLY CANCELLED!! finito! Done! 


so, I did actually end up apologizing to stacy, even though I didn‚Äôt think I had to but I just wanted this to get over with. stacy then blatantly ignored my messages for about 2 weeks before eventually replying to them. I then had a serious talk with her, explaining to her everything in depth and opening up my heart about this situation. How this makes me feel and how they ruin my vacation trip for this and how it wasn‚Äôt fair on my end. I also suggested they‚Äôd take a break from their friendship and not talk to each other for a while or have a sit down together and chat, just like I did with her. Stacy said she understood from where I was coming from and understood what I meant and acknowledged how bad this really is and that these 2 really need to have a chat about it to fix this. She seemed really sympathetic and understanding, which surprised me at first but I was also glad she understood my point of view and why this was important to me. Stacy thanked me for being so upfront and honest and promised me she‚Äôd talk to Amelia while grabbing some coffee the next day. I thanked her as well and we left it at that. I felt good having told Stacy what bothered me and I was hoping it‚Äôd get fixed now and they‚Äôd resolve the issue‚Ä¶ I WAS WRONG! Like really wrong. 

as the days went on, it seemed to go great until Amelia would continue to text me and rant to me about how Stacy is doing x y and z things and how much it annoyed her. How Stacy is having tantrums if things don‚Äôt go her way. How Stacy would sulk and make a scene for whatever reason‚Ä¶ I honestly had no clue what to even say or do anymore. I go numb. I thought I made my point clear. I have the feeling that both don‚Äôt even listen to me when I try to confront them about something, as Amelia also continues to hang out with Stacy almost daily and is asking herself why the arguments continue. I told her that the friendship may be long overdo. This ain‚Äôt a friendship anymore and clearly nothing will never change.

Yesterday while I was eating dinner, Amelia texted me and I quote: ‚ÄúShe arrived in a mood because she wants me to go to her house next week to meet some singer and watch her do some charity fashion show and I said no because I have to work these days sorry and she ain‚Äôt talking to me and just sitting with her headphones and we are having no food Because I said no.‚Äù - I flipped out on Amelia, finally reaching my last straw. I said to her ‚ÄúCan you guys just get your shit together already like this is why I talked to stacy about, not wanting to have any arguments when we spend again time together. I‚Äôm honestly so sick and tired of this bullshit and why can‚Äôt you guys ever behave? üò≠üò≠‚Äù - I honestly had enough and I told Amelia I‚Äôm gonna cancel the uk trip now because I‚Äôm done dealing with this. nothing will ever change between the 2 and Amelia even told me that Stacy NEVER even had a serious conversation about this whole thing. Why tf did I then have a whole ass talk with stacy for? So she just agreed to everything I said without even meaning it? and she doesn‚Äôt give 2 shits? Amelia was sad I was gonna cancel the trip but too bad motherfucker. It‚Äôs your fault. I‚Äôm done playing patient. I‚Äôve done everything I could. At this point I don‚Äôt even want to go anymore. Not because of them constantly fighting but in general. I‚Äôm not that interested anymore and I was hesitating to proceed with the planning of this and as we reached September, I was growing more anxious but that‚Äôs now off the table.


To get a second opinion, I texted my mom, asking her if that was a right decision and even my mom agreed that it‚Äôs best I canceled it because i wouldn‚Äôt have been happy anyway (which is true). My mom also agrees that Amelia and stacy have no friendship anymore but just keep each other around out of habit. They have been friends for 10+ years and it became a habit clearly. I told Amelia what my mom has said and Amelia is fine with me canceling the trip now and understands that she needs new friends but she also keeps telling me, it‚Äôs hard to make friends. She has met one girl but she loves absolutely nothing; according to Amelia, this girl doesn‚Äôt like music, doesn‚Äôt like concerts, doesn‚Äôt like going out, doesn‚Äôt like shopping, doesn‚Äôt like anything really other than her boyfriend and her dog. That‚Äôs the only 2 things she likes. She‚Äôs just strange lol but Amelia should just maybe go out more and meet someone idk. She keeps saying how much she misses me and misses seeing me. Of course I miss her too but I don‚Äôt wanna see stacy right now and I‚Äôm doing myself a favor and call the whole thing off. If they can‚Äôt behave and just shut up for once, i have to take matters into my own hands. The trip is off and i don‚Äôt have to worry about it anymore. My mom said it was the right decision and i say the same. They can go and see that singer alone but im not joining them anymore. I won‚Äôt waste yet again time and money on this. Their actions have consequences and that‚Äôs their consequence now! sorry not sorry 

Anyways, thats all I wanted to update you on. I thank you for listening and giving me a space to vent about this. This will be the last time I ever mention this again. Just thought of giving you an update on the situation. Thank fuck it‚Äôs canceled now lol ",0,1756992221.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

Whether you‚Äôre a student, professional, caregiver, or entrepreneur, a thoughtful morning routine sets the tone for everything that follows.¬†

# Why Morning Routines Matter¬†

A morning routine acts as an anchor. It gives structure to your day and helps you reclaim time before the external world begins to place its demands on you. This routine does not have to be a rigid schedule. Think of your morning routine as an intention, the way you want to launch your day. When you consistently include activities that nourish your mind and body, you build momentum for the rest of the day.¬†

# 7 Simple Morning Habits to Start Your Day Right¬†

**1. Wake Up at a Consistent Time**¬†

This time does not have to be before the sun. Consistency is more important than getting an early start on the day.¬†¬†

No matter the hour, waking up at the same time each day helps regulate your body‚Äôs internal clock (circadian rhythm), making it easier to fall asleep at night and wake up feeling refreshed.¬†¬†

**2. Hydrate**¬†¬†

Your body becomes dehydrated overnight. Consider placing a water bottle by your bed to make it easy to begin your day with water.¬†¬†

Immediately addressing overnight dehydration can stave off fatigue, headaches, and poor concentration and can jumpstart your metabolism even before your morning coffee.¬†

**3. Get Moving**¬†

Morning is a great time to introduce exercise into your daily routine. Fitting in a work out before other priorities can derail it ensures that you meet exercise goals. Morning exercise can improve attention, memory, and decision-making [throughout the day](https://www.technologynetworks.com/neuroscience/news/a-morning-workout-helps-power-your-brain-until-night-394180).¬†¬†

But even if you do not do a full workout in the morning, you‚Äôll benefit from some type of early movement that could include a brief yoga practice, stretching, a walk around the neighborhood (maybe with your dog), or even just some jumping jacks in between sips of water or while you wait for your coffee.¬†¬†

https://preview.redd.it/io9bwxntf5nf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f14d9d80992cbeaa524c9ef7561426f00e8c3fd

**4.  Practice Mindfulness or Meditation**¬†

Starting your day with stillness helps cultivate focus and clarity. Just like with exercise, this does not have to be long, formal practice.¬†¬†

Just a couple minutes of journaling, reading, writing down a positive thought or goals for the day, or using a mindfulness app can have an impact on your mindset heading into the day.¬†¬†

**5. Eat Breakfast**

‚ÄúBreakfast is the most important meal of the day.‚Äù This might be an overused phase, but it‚Äôs true. Your brain and body need fuel to function effectively. After hours of sleep your body is depleted. Eating breakfast stabilizes blood sugar, helping you avoid mood swings and brain fog.¬†¬†

Stock your kitchen with quick and easy breakfast foods that balance protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs‚Äîsuch as eggs with avocado toast, a smoothie with spinach and protein powder, or Greek yogurt with berries and nuts.¬†

¬†**6. Plan Your Day**

Perhaps as part of your mindfulness exercise, take a few minutes to review your goals and schedule. Identify your top three priorities for the day. What‚Äôs one thing you must get done? Creating a plan helps you stay on task and reduces decision fatigue.¬†

**7. Limit Screen Time**

Avoid immediately diving into emails, social media, or news. Consuming external stimuli first thing in the morning can spike cortisol levels and distract you from your morning routine. If you use your phone for music, work out apps, or meditation, put it on airplane mode or use ‚ÄúFocus‚Äù settings to stay distraction-free.¬†

# Make Your Morning Routine Your Own

Building a morning routine will take time as well as trial and error. Start small, introducing one or two activities. Add on additional activities as the routine starts to feel‚Ä¶.well‚Ä¶routine. Be flexible and be willing to change what‚Äôs not working. Don‚Äôt panic if you miss a morning or two due to sickness, travel, or other commitments ‚Äì just restart activities as you are able. Prepare the night before by laying out workout clothes or preparing breakfast in advance.¬†¬†

Your morning routine should reflect your values and needs. Creative individuals may prioritize writing, busy parents may focus on quiet meditation before kids get up. Build your routine around what you need right now. When practiced consistently, a morning routine becomes a form of self-care and self-respect.¬†

So tomorrow morning, before the world has a chance to steer your direction, take a breath, drink some water, move your body, and check in with yourself. You might be surprised by how powerful those first moments of the day can be.¬†

[A man makes tea at a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, on the southern Gaza Strip on February 28, 2024, amid ongoing battles between Israel and terror group Hamas. \(AFP\)](https://preview.redd.it/qvfoc5h3f5nf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ad97c5a57c7db219789beb086df07f964221594)

One of thousands of public servants in Gaza‚Äôs Hamas-run government, Karim, a public works ministry employee, received what seemed like an ordinary message on his phone: an invitation ‚Äúfor a coffee.‚Äù

The text gave a time for a meeting near a school sheltering displaced people amid the wreckage and rubble of nearly two years of war between Hamas and Israel in the Gaza Strip, which was triggered on October 7, 2023, when the Palestinian terror group led a devastating invasion of southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.

Karim, who, like others interviewed by AFP, asked to use a pseudonym, explained how he went to the meeting in July terrified of a possible Israeli attack, but found ‚Äúan employee I knew waiting for me.‚Äù

  
He ‚Äúgave me 1,000 shekels ($298),‚Äù the 39-year-old said, adding that that was only part of his pre-war salary of 2,900 shekels.

The war has destroyed public infrastructure and put most Hamas government employees out of work, but testimonies gathered by AFP from civil servants confirm Hamas is still paying some salaries, at least in part and with delays.

Israel has dealt a series of body blows to Hamas and its institutions over the past two years, decimating the terror group that seized total control of Gaza from the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority in a deadly 2007 coup.

[This picture taken from a position at Israel‚Äôs border with the Gaza Strip shows smoke billowing during an Israeli strike on the Palestinian territory on September 3, 2025. \(Jack GUEZ \/ AFP\)](https://preview.redd.it/wc81on07f5nf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cb6d9e3f55fbc75a68e440506066de277da4354)

Residents in Gaza explained they try to avoid being close to people linked to Hamas or its fighters, for fear of the Israeli military locating and targeting them with strikes that often kill or injure those around them.

According to witnesses, the army has repeatedly targeted people sent by Hamas to deliver salaries.

# ‚ÄòEscaped death‚Äô

Alaa, a teacher at a public school in Gaza City, last received a salary in June.

The mother of five had received a text message asking her to go to a school sheltering displaced people in northern Gaza.

When she arrived, ‚Äúthe school had just been bombed and the employee in charge of distributing salaries had fled. Thank God I was late, I escaped death.‚Äù

She had to return to the area the next day to receive her salary, she said.

The Israeli army regularly carries out strikes on schools, where displaced people shelter, accusing fighters from Hamas and other terror groups of using them as bases and command posts despite the danger such use poses to noncombatants.

The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 63,000 people in the Strip have been killed or are presumed dead in the fighting so far, though the toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. Israel says it has killed over 22,000 combatants in battle as of August and another 1,600 terrorists inside Israel during the October 7 onslaught.

Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza‚Äôs civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.

Before the war, Hamas‚Äôs government employed an estimated 40,000 people, drawing from revenue from customs duties and taxes to run public services.

From 2021 until the start of the war in Gaza in 2023, Qatar pledged $360 million in annual funding to the Palestinian territory, at Israel‚Äôs request, which included salaries of civil servants such as doctors and teachers.¬†Doha has denied providing financial aid to Hamas.

Hamas officials had claimed, before the war in Gaza, to have received financial support from Iran, though the Islamic Republic has never confirmed providing funds.

According to an official familiar with the matter in Gaza who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, Hamas obtained cash mainly through smuggling via tunnels dug near the border or by sea, despite Israel‚Äôs blockade.

In February 2024, the Israeli army released videos of safes and bags containing large sums of money (in shekels, US dollars and Jordanian dinars) that it said it had discovered in tunnels under Gaza, along with documents it claimed proved cash transfers from Iran to Hamas.

Jamil, 43, an accountant at a government institution, told AFP Hamas ‚Äústored hundreds of millions of dollars in tunnels or safe places for difficult times such as war,‚Äù without providing further details.

Israel has also long claimed that significant portions of the humanitarian aid entering Gaza were diverted by the terror group and sold on the black market for inflated prices or handed to loyalists.

The remarks about Hamas payments matched those in a similar previous report by the¬†[BBC](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-using-secret-cash-stockpile-looted-aid-to-pay-employees-and-loyalists-bbc/).

# ‚ÄòMafia‚Äô

The Israeli military has hit Hamas‚Äôs infrastructure and targeted financial leaders like Ismail Barhoum,¬†[who was killed in March](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-says-hamas-lying-about-top-official-being-killed-in-strike-under-medical-care-at-hospital/)¬†in an Israeli strike.

Israel has ‚Äúbombed Hamas-owned banks, places where money was stored, and assassinated financial system officials, but that didn‚Äôt stop the process,‚Äù he said.

According to a Hamas source who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, senior officials receive their salaries in secret, where they live, in displacement camps or schools turned shelters, ‚Äúso as not to be exposed to strikes,‚Äù seemingly confirming Israel‚Äôs claim that Hamas uses the civilian population as human shields.

Jamil explained that the salary payment process is ‚Äúvery complex,‚Äù changing according to the security situation.

Hamas ‚Äúis keen to pay part of the salaries as soon as the funds are available,‚Äù he added.

But officials interviewed by AFP complain their wages are not enough to meet basic needs, in a territory where the UN declared famine last month.

Others complained that only civil servants who are members of Hamas get paid.

Massoud, an officer in the Hamas police force, said he recently received a message on his wife‚Äôs phone inviting him to ‚Äúhave tea.‚Äù

His wife was pleasantly surprised, grateful that his salary had arrived.

But the money ‚Äúis not enough to eat, and we are hungry,‚Äù he told AFP.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre with the resistance,‚Äù he said of Hamas, but added the terror group should have been ‚Äúprepared for such hellish times.‚Äù

Abdallah, 38, a teacher, last received his salary (950 shekels) in July, stretching it, like most Gazans who still manage an income, to feed 20 extended family members after his three brothers were killed near aid distribution sites.

‚ÄúI said goodbye to my wife and children without telling them I was going to get my salary.‚Äù

This way of being paid is ‚Äúpainful, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre working for the mafia.‚Äù

1n89vwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1n89vwr/im_at_a_loss/,I‚Äôm at a loss‚Ä¶,"Some background, we live in the same town, about five minutes for each other but never knew because his parents homeschooled later transitioning to public when they had four kids total. He was the parentified oldest sibling, ‚Äúfirst born,‚Äù they call em. He had to deal with an immature groomer of a mother who acted as though they were her ‚Äúboy toys,‚Äù rather than sons. Even using that wording while slapping their booty or thighs. She‚Äôd buy clothes too small bc they‚Äôd make certain features look as us gen z say, snatched. They weren‚Äôt allowed a door on the little room they were sardined in & were heavily surveilled. Messages, location, search history, etc. She was/is obsessed with the idea of her three boys having s*x for some odd reason. Constantly accusing them throughout life while enforcing woman other than her and the sis are evil and will manipulate you, taking all your money. She put their sister on a pedestal, she could do no wrong, never any consequences, special treatment & privileges. The mother would sock away money from the dad‚Äôs paycheck weekly, later stealing from the boys too. She also had a problem with EVERYONE in their lives that wasn‚Äôt picked out by herself. 
     His father was/is a major pushover. Seems to have wanted a family but got way more than he bargained for. He never stood up for any of his three boys and would make matters worse by siding with the mother and or sister always. Reinforcing the idea of everyone‚Äôs evil except mommy and baby sister. Even stooping to their level by smack talking the people he chose to spend his time with harassing him on the daily. When stuff was bad with the mom or sister he‚Äôd be the one calling nonstop to get in his ear about ‚Äúyou need to grow up! That‚Äôs your mother! She‚Äôs devastated right now you won‚Äôt talk to her, she‚Äôs depressed and doesn‚Äôt want to exist anymore. You need to apologize to your mother,‚Äù blah blah. Instead of siding with his boys on her behavior being atrocious. He‚Äôs nothing more than a pawn and atm to his ‚Äúmother.‚Äù 
     I don‚Äôt know where to even start with the sister‚Ä¶ she takes after the mother for sure but with violence. Homegirl literally cannot resort to anything other than flying off the rail & assaulting someone while screeching at the top of her lungs. Toddler behavior. She‚Äôs obsessive over the three boys, acting as though they‚Äôre her property/possession. She straight up stated ‚ÄúI hate any female in my brother‚Äôs life. They‚Äôre my competition.‚Äù She‚Äôd date and did nothing but harass the boys over how awful they are to her and how they need to be big brothers and step in to defend and fight for her. Yet anytime they did so much as bring up a woman‚Äôs name she‚Äôd flip her lid causing a scene, beat them bloody even. She‚Äôs steal all their clothes down to the pants they wore without undies. Get ready to send them Snapchat pictures, like full face of makeup, posing, like you‚Äôd do for your boyfriend/girlfriend. It was a nightly occurrence for her to lose her shi screaming for no good reason, or just start hitting the bros, throwing a legit adult tantrum. His father never failing to call afterwards to ream him out for being mean to his poor defenseless baby sister who chose to assault him over a bad day. There‚Äôs really nothing Lee to her other than she‚Äôs an extremely violent obsessive stalker weirdo that lets her delusions run her life. 
     His family was always a red flag, he was exceptionally open about it when we were friends. Later going into more depth when some uncomfy situations arised like his sister growling at me like an animal, his mother damn near army crawling behind my car to my window at night. Them panty raiding me‚Ä¶ 
     When we officially started dating they kicked it into high gear. His mom was obsessively texting and getting his father to call about when she gets to meet me when she already had a handful of times. Also good to note their house is disgusting, a biohazard of dog piss, fur, and lack of cleaning for years on end. They aren‚Äôt the type to plan a dinner where we could talk and get to know each other, just a chaotic last minute the whole ahh family who hates each other is all there fighting already type vibe. Not that did subject myself to that but just goes to further show how not in reality they are. 
     His first birthday we spend together as a couple his mom lost her mind.  He claimed they never did anything for his birthday, that it was normally, as always, about his sister not him. so he was hyped to spend with me. I planned a night, cooked lobster bisque Maine style, had tie dyed this nice sweatshirt from the greenhouse I worked with, got him some Mary Jane needs, wrote a nice card, some candy and other sedimental items. It took a week plus to throw everything together in secret and wrap it cutesy. His mom calls the day of flipping her lid about how he‚Äôs not going to calibrate with them. That she went outta her way to plan this extravagant night for all of them because family is the most important thing! He ended up entertaining it cause he unfortunately still had items there he needed. However when he showed up to make an appearance, they stood him up. He came back frustrated they pulled this crap again, and wasted our time. Thankfully he came home to a nice surprise. 
     Thanksgiving, which was my birthday‚Ä¶ they lost their everliving minds again. He hated any holiday with them. Said it was never about fun, only about appearance as a big close happy family for social. Repeats of pictures for hours on end to capture the ‚Äúhappy moment.‚Äù Because they didn‚Äôt look excited enough the first time. Anyways, after 50+ phone calls she sent someone over to my house to pick him up. Claiming they couldn‚Äôt start dinner without him, it was the end of the fkn world dude. Meanwhile it wasn‚Äôt a secret he was spending the holiday and my bday with me. Really sucked too, it was the first thanksgiving without MY family‚Ä¶I also baked them a pie despite their craziness as a kind gesture. 
     They then started calling anytime we were together needing the smallest things. Dogfood even though we had already been to the pet store and asked if they needed anything. Or them needing him to let the dogs he wanted zero responsibility for outside just for him to come home to a house full of people who are able to let them out. Just don‚Äôt feel like it. Once, his sister called demanding a ride home, he told her to go call the parents as we had been on our way to dinner. She raged n broke smashed her phone into smithereens because she viewed that as him choosing me over her. 
     Then came the social stalking. It had def been going on the whole time but now hiss sister was talking screenshots of any post with us together, sending it to the family groupchat to talk about how I‚Äôm a home wrecking junkie. (I‚Äôve never done hard drugs and don‚Äôt plan to‚Ä¶) tho lead to him blocking her on socials, me too however I realized she must‚Äôve done some digging for mine and beat me to it. Which I find a bit bizarre tbh. Like you searched up my shi just to block it outta spite while still stealing the same pics off mans account. His mother called on Christmas Eve as we‚Äôre getting ready to do fireworks about him blocking his sister. She flew off the hinges not caring to accept the reality that her and her daughter‚Äôs behavior is unacceptable. She blamed me instead. 
      Weirdo texts from his mom would come in from time to time after Christmas when he was fully moved in with me. Talking about ‚Äúcome home, take a nice shower and sleep in baby sisters bed for the night I‚Äôm making xyz for dinner,‚Äù their shower/bathroom is disgusting because she wouldn‚Äôt let the boys fix it ever. There‚Äôs a sub pump in the damn shower that drains it out the window. She never cooks dinner and if she does it‚Äôs something no dodgy necessarily likes. Oh and why tf would he wanna sleep in his sisters bed who‚Äôs crazy af and harbors inappropriate feelings for him. It further fueled his and my resentment. 
     His parents ended up having a conversation with mine months later because they were going to pick up his company vehicle off my property without notifying anyone. Which, who does that? You‚Äôre gonna just whip up to someone house you‚Äôve never been to before without their knowledge or permission? Weird. My parents ended up reaching out once made aware of the situation asking to meet up & talk. The conversation was validating, supported my claims of them being uncomfortably not right in the head. They talked bad about me, to my own parents. Calling me toxic, problematic, that we aren‚Äôt a good fit. They know their son and he‚Äôs very special, probably won‚Äôt ever be able to function in his own because he‚Äôs such a weakling mentally and can‚Äôt make rational decisions. Like what? then proceeded to gush about the younger sister who everyone in the damn town and surrounding knows damn well she‚Äôs a violent abuser pos at this point. My parents were flabbergasted. They also had interrogated them about our living arrangements. If we sleep in the same room, share a bed, have a door that‚Äôs allowed to be closed. If we‚Äôre chaperoned. My mom responded, ‚Äúwell, that‚Äôs the beauty of having adult children!! They‚Äôre independent and it‚Äôs a blessing watching them grow!‚Äù But yeah another thing his weirdo ass mom would do is not allow blankets, and would chaperone if not sit in between the sons while they had a girl over. Then would cry about them inviting nobody over. I had my parent‚Äôs support fully after that thankfully. 
     We ended up getting a camper trailer for trade one day, wanting to renovate it into a tiny off grid home for when we developed property. His grandparents having the huge yard they do dedicated to the grandchildren, offered us a spot to work on it. Only problem being it‚Äôs directly across the street from his parent‚Äôs house‚Ä¶ his grandparents, the mother‚Äôs side, are saints. Wouldn‚Äôt believe she came from such sweet people. While not being able to turn down that offer and wanting to get to know his grandparents, I knew it‚Äôd bite us in the ass eventually and it sure did. They saw the trailer the day of and lost their minds harassing the grandmother about who what where when why how. They ended up running over one day when we were demolishing the old stuff inside, it was an absolute construction zone hazard. We had a fire going, burning the old rotten wood. They immediately start screaming about the smoke from the fire while the mother tries to force her way inside. Mans ins tending in the doorway at this point telling them to f*ck off and go home. Sis starts screeching about him not talking to her in over a year before laying rubber out the driveway. The mother returns within 15 minutes standing at the doorway arms crossed giving attitude like a teenage girl. Thankfully at this point his brother who also abandoned their toxic household to live with the grandparents, appeared and caused a scene to get her to go tf home. The grandparents then came over and asked what that was all about, apologizing they couldn‚Äôt stop them from showing up. That they didn‚Äôt even stop to say hi before storming into the backyard n how disrespectful this all is. His other brother who still lives at home was sent over to white knight mommy, reprimanding mans for hurting her feelings telling him we need to get our shi together. I asked him how he‚Äôd feel if his girlfriend‚Äôs dad exhibited the same behavior to the extent his undies were stolen. He had no words.  
     My boyfriend ended up spilling the tea to his grandparents about what went on in his household, gaining their support and knowledge on the matter. The mother and sister continued to prove our point by showing up unwanted, unannounced, causing problems, screaming, crying, throwing adult tantrums with nothing but delusion to back it up. Things really took a turn for the worst when one night, my boyfriend had been having a hard time mentally with everything going on. He had a breakdown over getting the wrong piece of wood later stating it was more than just the wood. It was a combination of all the stress caused by his family, renovation, and the strain his mother and sister have put on our relationship. We‚Äôre outside getting some air when we hear screaming. We turn to see three headlamps coming in our direction. His sisters the first to appear, immediately lunging at me screeching like a banshee ‚ÄúI swear to god if you do so much as touch a hair on his head!!!‚Äù Mother n father catch up and grab both her arms yelling that they‚Äôre calling the police on me. To which I reply ‚Äúyes, please do.‚Äù I would have LOVED to get an officer over there as not only a witness, but to have support on the fact this psychotic ass family has been harassing, stalking, threatening, and now coming at me physically. After I agreed they were stern on no cops involved and that I was not leaving the property. I‚Äôm starting to panic. I lost my phone in the chaos so I couldn‚Äôt call my mom dad or sister. The only response I had for them at that point since they aren‚Äôt gonna listen to facts or reason was, ‚Äúcall my f*cking mom.‚Äù His father dialed a number, showed it to me for a second before saying she didn‚Äôt answer. Y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ my mom always answers. His grandmother had come out due to the commotion, standing in between us and the psychos. She stumbled on my phone on her way out. Thank god. I got my sister on the line to hear everything while using the distraction of her trying to reason with them to leave. His father tried coming after my vehicle. It was absolutely horrific and traumatizing. I felt so trapped and alone without my family there. I almost got assaulted over some delusional assumption in this b*tches head. She claimed to have heard it from allllll the way across the street when grammie will back us up on the fact she never woke up and she lives right there. I think Homegirl was at home, mad nobody was there to put up with her drama, it manifested into some unhealthy feelings that she could t control and acted on. 
     They took only a week break after that before trying to start back up with the bs. Even coming at the grandmother now. Accusing her of choosing me over them. Saying we spend all the time in the world together while I purposely disinclude them. Ran over there one time crying about how she knew for a fact we were having s*x. She knew I was spending the night because she can see the driveway from her house and made an effort to wake up at 4am everyday to make sure my car left with his. Idk if she thought that was going to help her case cause that‚Äôs exposing yourself right there‚Ä¶ then the sister scurried over crying screaming throwing up about how she‚Äôs terrified mans is never going to talk to her again while gram reiterated that she doesn‚Äôt seem to care too much or she wouldn‚Äôt have acted the way she did to lead up to this. She then turned harsh and hasn‚Äôt been over to see her gram since. His father started up with calling him 24/7 again on the daily interrogating him, telling him he needs to apologize to poor mommy. That‚Äôs she‚Äôs deathly depressed her special child first born abandoned her. That she‚Äôs loosing sleep over the fact she might not be able to see her grandbabies. Which, we don‚Äôt plan on having kids in this economy/country tbh. N if we did, she sure as hell would have zero involvement and or entitlement towards them. So I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs loosing sleep over her own actions and delusions. He got on mans case saying I need to grow up, talk to his mom. We need to go out for coffee, it‚Äôll fix everything. As if I‚Äôm gonna go get coffee with the lady who touched her child stole my undies and has been a dumpster fire of human being with nothing nice to say since day one. 
     His sister messaged him a day his brothers were fighting. She used that as an excuse to message him harassment about me. Loosing her mind about how I‚Äôm a homewrecking c*nt who stole him away. She loved him. It was radiating crazy ex. If she truly loved this man appropriately, one, she wouldn‚Äôt beat him bloody with blunt objects. Two, she wouldn‚Äôt be going crazy over him dating a person. Like what. It‚Äôs insane they try so hard to push this agenda of ‚Äúwell she loves you as her big brother. She‚Äôs just concerned. She loves you!!!‚Äù Like no tf she don‚Äôt. She craves control. She tried to tell him we are all gonna have a sit down family meeting at the grandparents. They said hell no you‚Äôre not haha. 
     Things had been quiet for a while after the grandparents got involved retiring to them they need to cut the shi. However recently, year three, they‚Äôre starting back up‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre fixing a bathroom in the house and his family feels entitled to get involved and means that we fix it quicker. There‚Äôs no speeding up cement drying but okay. Also not your house to b*tch about. Anyways‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôre gonna start running back over again. There‚Äôs so much I had to leave out to not make this more of a novel than it already is. The length of this is unreal and I apologize. I‚Äôve rewrote it a couple too many times and need to stick with what I got. I‚Äôm at the point where I wish taking legal action was an option however I‚Äôm not the most educated when it comes to that. With the knowledge I know now about his childhood they could be behind bars for a long time. I just want true zero contact with no issues. Blocking them will only make them get physical. It‚Äôll also make my boyfriend‚Äôs job difficult as him and his father are in the same union, and he loves to talk bad about his child to sway his career in a negative light. I‚Äôm at a loss. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this anymore without stepping in myself since I haven‚Äôt I this whole time. I‚Äôve done nothing but keep my peace and not open my mouth. This vent has dragged on long enough though, thanks if you stuck around until the end. ",1,1756991882.0,motherinlawsfromhell,2,1.0,False

Excited pa naman akong kumain kanina kasi may baon ako na pork steak and fried egg. Sa ref ng 9th floor pantry ko iniwan while working sa production floor sa 8th floor. 11 am ang lunch break ko pero hindi ko makuha ang baon ko sa pantry that time. Closed door! May note sa pinto na reserved for project _! Excuse me, sa pantry talaga nag memeeting? Madami naman training room sa gateway 2 diba? Bakit??? Wala  naman akong nakita sa email na announcement about closing the pantry for the project eme. 

Result is hindi ako nakakain ng matino during my lunch break. Nag coffee na lang ako sa Krispy Kreme. Gutom + inis so pagbalik ko sa production nag rant sa people lead ko about meeting nila sa 9th floor pantry. Bakit daw hindi ako pumasok? Well, naiisip ko un pero while i was about to enter may nakita akong 2 employees. Hindi ko sila kilala. Naghihilahan sila parang agent and TL nagtuturuan kung sino sa kanila ang papasok dun. Sabi nung TL ""hindi ko kayang pumasok jan"". So kung si TL nga hindi nag attempt sino pa ako?  Naiisip ko din  baka may confidential information sila dun mapagkamalan pa ako na nageeavesdrop. To be on the safe side after shift ko na binalikan ung baon ko. Inuwi ko na lang and kinain for dinner today. 

Ginulat ko si people lead ko kanina. Nagmaldita na naman ako, sabi ko talaga ill escalate this sa ""PESH"" sabay open sa pesh sa laptop ko. Hindi kasi tama ung walang announcement basta nalang nagsara ng door ng pantry. Today pa sila nag ganun kung kelan ako may topak. Since morning may attitude na ako. Wag ako!

By the middle of each month, the same question came up:¬†*‚ÄúWhere did all the money go?‚Äù*¬†and somehow it always turned into tension.

I still remember one night, bills scattered on the kitchen table at 11 PM. We were both exhausted from work, yet instead of resting we were arguing about receipts and blaming each other for ‚Äúlittle‚Äù expenses that kept piling up. It wasn‚Äôt really about the money‚Äîit was about the stress, the lack of control, and feeling like we weren‚Äôt on the same team.

We tried a bunch of things. Budgeting apps we forgot to open after a week. A messy Excel file that only one of us understood. Even scribbling notes in a paper notebook. Nothing stuck. Every system felt too complicated, and we‚Äôd fall back into the same cycle.

Out of pure frustration, we sat down one weekend and created something super simple‚Äîa single page to write down what we earn, what we spend, and what‚Äôs left. Nothing fancy, just a place we could both open and update.

That tiny change made a huge difference. For the first time, we saw exactly where the money was actually going‚Äîgroceries, subscriptions we‚Äôd forgotten, coffee runs that added up. It wasn‚Äôt pretty, but at least it was clear.

Now, instead of blaming each other, we sit down once a week, open the page, and talk about what to adjust. We still don‚Äôt have it all figured out, but the arguments have turned into conversations. And honestly, that feels like progress.

**üëâ Has anyone else dealt with money fights in their relationship? How did you handle it?**

**TL;DR;**¬†: We (M24, F23) used to fight every month about money. Tried apps, Excel, notebooks‚Äînothing worked. Made one simple page to track everything together, and now we talk instead of fight. Curious how other couples handled money stress.",0,1756991789.0,MuslimMarriage,2,0.5,False

Because of the ‚ÄòGreywood Gala‚Äô, a robust ceremony where supervillains network, celebrate, and recognize aspiring ne‚Äôer-do-wells. For decades, heroes have failed to find it, that is, until you received an invite. [Part 2/Ending]","‚ÄúIt should be? What, did you win the villain of the year award?‚Äù He joked, only to wonder about that. ‚ÄúDid you actually? Do they have an awards show here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve won that award this year, but there is certainly an awards show later on. I believe it should be in thirty minutes; would you like to grab some food before the show? Or do you plan to get swooped away by another villain? I knew you were popular. I just didn‚Äôt expect you to be this popular.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, some food sounds nice. No one‚Äôs going to spit in it, are they?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot unless you ask them to.‚Äù

Jeremy expected a menu. Instead, as he sat down, two plates of food were brought to their table, with the henchman giving them both a nod before setting each plate down. Jeremy had a Caesar salad and a hotdog. While Linda got a simple cheeseburger. She picked up her burger, taking a small bite, watching Jeremy stare at his plate, confused. ‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect to get a hotdog and salad. That‚Äôs all. Even if I kind of felt like eating it.‚Äù He had been thinking about hotdogs all day, and the salad was a pleasant touch. Still, it didn‚Äôt feel like the type of food a person eats in a place like this. ‚ÄúDid the chef know what I was going to want?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. Temlias has an ability where she can tell exactly what a person wants. Even just by reading their name on a guest-list. If you book a table, they‚Äôll have the meal ready for you when you sit down. The ability only works on material things ‚Äî clothes, food, things like that. They can‚Äôt tell your mental desires. So, things like friendship and love aren‚Äôt visible.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you booked this table expecting us to eat here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI planned every part of this day out. Are you surprised? I‚Äôve always been very organized.‚Äù She said, already having finished her burger. ‚ÄúYou should eat. The shows about to start, and we should get to our seats.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre done? Alright, I‚Äôll chomp this down. In a wink, it‚Äôll be gone.‚Äù He laughed, only for Linda to shake her head.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lame catchphrase. The whole wink thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúKids like it. That‚Äôs all that matters.‚Äù

‚ÄúHm, guess you‚Äôre right.‚Äù She conceded. The pair made small talk before an announcement over the sound system told them they had five minutes until the awards show started. The two travelled down to their seats near the front, and sat, with Jeremy unsure what he should expect.

The lights dimmed as Golden Ruler stepped out, the man a legend among villains and heroes alike, considered a gentleman villain, in the vein of a Robin Hood or a similar character. To see a man like that without his black domino mask was an honour. Even if Golden Ruler was on the other team, Jeremy could respect the work he did to help others. When the man gave a bow, the room clapped, and when the clapping died down, Jeremy‚Äôs hands continued to smack together, as the silver-haired gentleman grinned.

‚ÄúThank you in particular. Whoever you are near the front. Glad to see this silver-haired man still has some fans.‚Äù He said, combing his hair with his fingers, earning a woo from the crowd. ‚ÄúOk, ok. Let‚Äôs all settle down. We have a lot of awards to get through, and I don‚Äôt know if my pacemaker has enough charge in it to last the night. So, let‚Äôs speed things up!‚Äù

Apart from the excitement of seeing Golden Ruler, Jeremy found the whole award show rather boring. Watching people go up onto the stage, while he leaned his head against Linda‚Äôs shoulder, resting against it, unaware that he was even beginning to fall asleep against her arm. When it got near the end of the night, Linda nudged him awake.

‚ÄúHuh? Is it over?‚Äù He whispered.

‚ÄúAnd tonight, we honor someone who has decided to hang up her creepy skeleton mask. The one and only Night Walker.‚Äù The crowd cheered, and Jeremy stared at his date in shock. She was retiring? It was the first he had heard about it. He got up from his seat and clapped for her, proud of her for stepping away from a life of crime. Linda climbed the steps and got onto the stage, shaking Golden Ruler‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúThank you. I‚Äôm not a person who likes monologuing, so I‚Äôll keep this short. Being a villain was all I thought I could be growing up. When people looked at me, they saw an evil blue-skinned person, and that‚Äôs what I started seeing myself as. That‚Äôs why I found comfort in being surrounded by other outcasts. Sure, some of you are horrible, and some of you I wish I had killed while I was still a villain, but to the rest of you. I felt at home. I won‚Äôt ever invite you out for coffee or have you over for a board-game, but I will treasure our time together. Thank you.‚Äù

The speech simple and beautiful. In a way, it mirrored her perfectly in Jeremy‚Äôs mind. Hotside shouted something from the crowd, yet it was lost in the claps and cheers. When the clapping settled down, Jeremy sat down, only to wince as the stage light landed on him this time.

‚ÄúIt is also my honour, as a neutral party, to hand out the next award. An award that is usually never handed to the recipient, and one that is known only to those of us who enter this room. I am referring to the Hero of the Year award. Us villains have been punched, broken, and beaten by many heroes. Some who treat us worse than even the most sadistic of villains would. Which is why people like Wink are so important. People who genuinely try to see us as people who can change. I‚Äôve known Wink since we were both sidekicks to other heroes and villains, and I‚Äôve seen him pull his punches on numerous occasions, even when it could have resulted in his death. There is something about Wink that all of us appreciate, and for everyone in this room, I know it‚Äôs a different thing. I‚Äôm proud to say you‚Äôre the best hero I‚Äôve ever seen, and I know many share that sentiment, so please, for one night only, let us show you we aren‚Äôt all monsters. At least until tomorrow.‚Äù She said with a sly smile.

Jeremy remained seated, frozen not in fear of what they would do to him if he got up, but out of emotion. He hadn‚Äôt even heard his fellow heroes say such nice things about him, so to hear them come from a villain‚Äôs mouth had him sniffling in his seat. A firm hand smacked his back, the pain stopping him from tearing up.

‚ÄúCry in the car on da way home. Get up there.‚Äù Hotside said, having rushed down the aisle to see the hero he voted as his favorite. ‚ÄúGo on, get up there.‚Äù Hotside sniffed, his fiery eyebrows curling as he started crying. ‚ÄúGO WINK.‚Äù

His legs wobbled as he walked up the stage, thinking he had steeled his nerves enough. When the audience of villains cheered, he felt a lump in his throat, stopping mid-step, needing a second to take this all in.

‚ÄúKid, come on. Pacemakers dying here.‚Äù Golden Ruler said, before grabbing his hand, pulling him into a hug. ‚ÄúYou did good. You‚Äôre the type of guy I would have loved back in the day. Since we aren‚Äôt back in the day, I‚Äôll love you now.‚Äù

‚ÄúLove him in your own time.‚Äù Linda said, giving him a hug after Golden Ruler. ‚ÄúCongratulations. It‚Äôs rare that we actually have a hero present when they win this award. First time for everything, isn‚Äôt there?‚Äù She gave him his statue, which depicted a hero getting crushed under the foot of a villain. That made Linda pause. ‚ÄúWe really should change the design of these trophies for the heroes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. We‚Äôve never had to give one to a hero, so we‚Äôve never had to worry about it.‚Äù Golden Ruler agreed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù Jeremy held the trophy up to the crowd, beaming. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù He said, only for Linda to hand him the microphone. ‚ÄúOh, um. Thank you. I don‚Äôt know what to say.‚Äù He wiped his eyes with his sleeve. ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll keep doing what I‚Äôve always done. All I‚Äôve ever wanted was for everyone to be safe and happy. Regardless of whether they're a villain or hero. No one deserves to live in pain.‚Äù

Golden Ruler clapped and took back the microphone, wrapping up the show. ‚ÄúThank you to everyone who attended. We will do this all again next year if I‚Äôm still alive by-‚Äú

The sound drifted into the background as Linda led him to the main hall, the two sitting down to share a drink. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it feel, hero?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Better than good. It feels great.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a bad first date, was it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù Jeremy clinked their glasses together. During their drinks, villains came over to either congratulate him, tell him why they voted for him, or to tell them why they hadn‚Äôt voted for him, and the whole time, Jeremy was enjoying himself. He laughed with some, had conversations with others, and shared heartfelt moments with the rest. When the night finished, Linda got her keys back from Jackie and pointed to her passenger seat.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a lift home.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know where I live?‚Äù he said, getting into the car.

‚ÄúNope. You can tell me now, though. I‚Äôm not a villain anymore. I‚Äôm retired. Good thing you heroes let us retire in peace. Even if it wasn‚Äôt cheap paying off all my damages and fines.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt act like you're broke because of it. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre still rolling in money.‚Äù

‚ÄúDiving in money, actually. Now, put your blindfold back on.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù He went to pick it up, only to hear a rare laugh from Linda.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm kidding. You can see where we are now. The location changes every year. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you tell them now. So, where am I taking you?‚Äù Jeremy gave her his address, and she started driving. ‚ÄúI live a few blocks from there. Small world, isn‚Äôt it? We could go to the same coffee shop and we wouldn‚Äôt have even known about it.‚Äù

When she pulled up outside his house, Jeremy stepped out, leaning against the door. ‚ÄúI had a lot of fun tonight. Thank you for inviting me. I think I needed that. It was a good reminder that the work I do affects people.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you for coming to it. I expected you to weasel out of it. Before you leave, I was wondering something.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúWant to grab coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly if you want to. I need something to do now that I‚Äôm retired, and you‚Äôre the most interesting choice for coffee that I have. If I don‚Äôt go with you, it‚Äôs Hotside, or what‚Äôs her demonic face. I‚Äôll pick you over them any day.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, sure. Would love to. Want me to give you my number?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you. I‚Äôve already got it. Bye, hero.‚Äù She drove off, leaving Jeremy in a great mood, the hero unsure what he would tell the agency when he met with them tomorrow, struggling to imagine they would believe whatever he told them.",3,1756991788.0,Sadnesslaughs,0,1.0,False

I'm 38, male, Central European (CET time zone), and currently in that thrilling/terrifying phase of life where I'm switching jobs and pretending not to panic about it. During the day I juggle responsibilities, but the evenings can feel a bit quiet. So I figured: why not find someone cool to chat with on the regular? Like... you know when we all dialed in into AOL for fun.

A bit about me:

* I'm 6'1 (190cm), tall enough to reach the top shelf but not tall enough to dunk. I'm slowly running my dad bod into extinction (started running again a few weeks ago, send oxygen pls).
* I love hiking and being outdoors. Nature is my reset button.
* I'm a hobby photographer and love black & white: architecture, nature, and occasionally humans (sometimes even au naturel...).

Context, 

Spain, 1998. I was visiting family in Western Europe. On this day, I was in a small Spanish city, more of a hamlet if I‚Äôm being honest. It was picturesque enough, likely the kind of place one might photograph and put on a postcard. You know, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I used a postcard, I may want to find a reason. Now, in this little hamlet, there was nothing particularly eye-catching, but nothing boring either. While avoiding social conversation with relatives I barely knew (as teens tend to do), I found myself in a small caf√©.

Now, my Portuguese is rough and lacks the eloquence of my English, so its ability to assist me with Spanish was, and still is, mostly useless. So, here, in this postcard-worthy city, I found myself trying to order an espresso, then a coffee, then really anything with caffeine. Luck, so I thought, was not on my side. Not yet. 

After what could best be called a lack of translation and, at worst, a butchery of communication, a woman appeared and interrupted my incompetence. She made some comments that, to this day, remain a mystery to me. Luckily enough, an espresso was brought to life, granted, a short one, but a delicious one.

Now, with my unexpected hero present and accounted for, we sat, drank, and talked for what felt equally like a lifetime and yet, only a moment. She was older, and though I‚Äôm not sure by how much, its likely what set me on a half decade journey of older woman and an reckless need to relive the moments I was actively on a collision course with. Her English, like my Portuguese, lacked a gentle touch. Yet her voice, accent, and tone more than made up for any faults in our communication.

From my confused attempt at caffeination to one woman‚Äôs heroic act that saved me, the day was turning out far better than I could have dreamed. Then, with ivory cups empty and caf√© windows beginning to close, she took my hand. Soft, quiet, the smell of caffeine and joy fresh in the air, she whispered, ‚ÄúCome.‚Äù

Now, I am a fool in many ways, so much so that my survival thus far is a testament to mankind‚Äôs resilience, or perhaps our blind luck. But even I know better than to question fate. Those who do rarely get happy endings. And so, I obeyed and for the second time that day she rescued me. This time, however, it was not by granting me warm drinks and good conversation. No. This time, it was to guide up old Roman steps, past loosely hung silk masquerading as a door, and up onto the roof of that same caf√©.

That was when I came crashing headlong into a memory older than my innocence. I still can‚Äôt speak Spanish, nor have I ever returned. Yet I still think of her and the postcard kept in my head.

So tell me. Am I the A**hole for having never bothered to ask her name?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Same-Game Parlay Breakdown: North Texas Mean Green vs. Western Michigan Broncos**  
*Where college football meets a circus of chaos, and the odds are as clear as a coach‚Äôs postgame press conference after a loss.*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

North Texas is the undisputed favorite here, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.26-1.30** (implied probability: **77-79%** to win). Western Michigan, the underdog, sits at **3.72-4.0** (implied probability: **23-27%**). The spread is a tidy **North Texas -10.0**, with most books offering near-even money on the line. Totals are locked at **58.5**, with no clear edge (1.91 for Over/Under).

**Key Takeaway:** North Texas is being priced like a robo-coach with a spreadsheet and a caffeine IV drip. They‚Äôre expected to win *and* do it by double digits. The total‚Äôs middle-ground pricing suggests a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù game‚Äîenough scoring to avoid a snoozer, but not enough to make you forget about the NFL.

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Mountain West Meltdowns

The Mountain West‚Äôs opening week was a dumpster fire for defending champ Boise State, which lost to South Florida. Meanwhile, Nevada and Utah State are showing promise, hinting that this conference might be a free-for-all in 2025. For this matchup:

* **North Texas**: No major injury updates, but their Week 1 performance (if any) isn‚Äôt detailed here. Let‚Äôs assume they‚Äôre the ‚ÄúMean Green‚Äù because they‚Äôre green with envy over their own dominance.
* **Western Michigan**: Also quiet on injuries, but their ‚ÄúBroncos‚Äù moniker feels like a desperate attempt to ride Boise‚Äôs coattails. They‚Äôre 0-2 in spreads this season, per the data, which is about as shocking as a coach yelling ‚ÄúHut!‚Äù in a Zoom meeting.

**Contextual Clue:** The Mountain West‚Äôs power rankings have UNLV at No. 1, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîno one‚Äôs keeping score except the AP writers sipping lukewarm coffee at 3 a.m.

1n89ofb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n89ofb/cannot_cope/,Cannot Cope,"I met my ex-boyfriend online. He was 44, and I was 20. We met on an app and hit it off instantly. It was wonderful and amazing. At the time, I was a junior in college. We went on a few dates, but I was still in a relationship with another man I was emotionally disconnected from. I didn‚Äôt want to be with him anymore and was already taking steps to move on.

When I met the 44-year-old, I felt like I could live life again. On our second date, we went to dinner at a restaurant, and he gave me this speech about how honesty meant everything to him. However, I had already done some digging on Facebook and discovered that he was married‚Äîto a woman who was terminally ill and living in an assisted living facility. He hadn‚Äôt yet told me that, but after our second date, he said he didn‚Äôt think it would work and broke things off. That‚Äôs when I revealed I already knew he was married.

We decided to give it another try and even went away to New Hampshire together in December. We clicked, and I knew I wanted to be with him. In January, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and that‚Äôs when I officially broke things off with the other man. After that, I barely saw my old boyfriend‚ÄîI only saw him once over winter break, and then we ended things.

Not long after, I was slated to do a study-abroad program in Washington, DC. I knew it meant leaving my boyfriend behind in Boston, and I wasn‚Äôt ready for that, but I also couldn‚Äôt put my career on pause. I wasn‚Äôt fully honest with him about the program. I told him it was a last-minute decision when in reality, I had known about it for a while. I also didn‚Äôt tell him it was school-affiliated because I worried he wouldn‚Äôt take it seriously, so I made it seem more important than it was. We decided to do long distance, and we stuck it out.

Halfway through the program, guilt caught up with me. I confessed the truth, and he was very angry and hurt. He almost broke up with me, but I convinced him not to.

While in DC, there was a fellow student I had been friends with for years. His mom was something of a mentor to me, so I wanted to stay in her good graces. My boyfriend, however, didn‚Äôt want me hanging out with him because he suspected the student had feelings for me‚Äîeven though I didn‚Äôt feel the same way. A year earlier, this friend and I had kissed once, but I never told my boyfriend because it didn‚Äôt feel relevant, and I knew I didn‚Äôt want a relationship with him. I preferred older men, like my boyfriend.

For most of the semester, I respected his wishes and declined my friend‚Äôs invitations to hang out. But eventually, I decided I shouldn‚Äôt let my boyfriend control who I was friends with‚Äîespecially since he was still married. So I met up with my friend once. Nothing romantic happened; we just had coffee and salads. I didn‚Äôt tell my boyfriend about it.

After the program ended, I returned to Boston and moved in with my boyfriend. It was blissful. We were so in love. I cooked him dinner every night, cleaned the house, did the dishes, fed the dog, folded his clothes‚Äîeverything. We even planned a big vacation in August.

Then in June, my grandmother passed away, and I had to return home for the funeral. Unexpectedly, the ex I had left for my 44-year-old reached out to me beforehand about arrangements. I was furious that he contacted me, so I told him off and blocked him. I didn‚Äôt tell my boyfriend, because I thought of it as closure for myself. But the guilt of all my lies built up until I had an anxiety attack in bed. Eventually, I confessed everything.

He was furious but tried to forgive me, mostly because he didn‚Äôt want to lose the money he had already spent on our upcoming vacation. We tried to make things work, but fights kept happening. Whenever we fought, he would take back the expensive gifts he gave me and throw all the things he had done for me in my face.

He said my lies were too much. I felt blindsided. After all, he lied too‚Äîhe lied to his family about my age because he was insecure about it, and when he met my parents, he lied about his marital status, claiming he was divorced when he wasn‚Äôt.

While we were together, he even started the divorce process because we talked about marriage and kids. But now it‚Äôs over. He said he couldn‚Äôt be with someone he couldn‚Äôt trust, someone he had to support financially while I was still in school, or someone whose family he couldn‚Äôt fully meet.

I loved him with all my heart, and I feel in denial about what happened. I‚Äôd do anything to make it work‚ÄîI‚Äôd tell all my family about him, post him on Instagram, whatever it took. But he‚Äôs cold toward me now. He‚Äôs blocked me on everything.

I can‚Äôt make sense of this, and I feel like I‚Äôm still holding onto false hope that he might come back.

  
I feel like if I could just show him how much I am willing to do to change all the things he had a problem with, he would come back. 

  
When we broke up, he turned so cold and told me not to reach out to him anymore. I showed up at his house the day after I moved out after the breakup, hoping to reconcile things, but that didn't happen. He let me in to say my piece, then asked me to leave. We agreed to speak one more time about some test results I had to give him, and he agreed.  



I gave him the results, but then after blocked me, and now there's no way to contact him at all. I just want to write him a letter apologizing for everything and showing all the things I would do to change what happened.

By the middle of each month, the same question came up:¬†*‚ÄúWhere did all the money go?‚Äù*¬†and somehow it always turned into tension.

I still remember one night, bills scattered on the kitchen table at 11 PM. We were both exhausted from work, yet instead of resting we were arguing about receipts and blaming each other for ‚Äúlittle‚Äù expenses that kept piling up. It wasn‚Äôt really about the money‚Äîit was about the stress, the lack of control, and feeling like we weren‚Äôt on the same team.

We tried a bunch of things. Budgeting apps we forgot to open after a week. A messy Excel file that only one of us understood. Even scribbling notes in a paper notebook. Nothing stuck. Every system felt too complicated, and we‚Äôd fall back into the same cycle.

Out of pure frustration, we sat down one weekend and created something super simple‚Äîa single page to write down what we earn, what we spend, and what‚Äôs left. Nothing fancy, just a place we could both open and update.

That tiny change made a huge difference. For the first time, we saw exactly where the money was actually going‚Äîgroceries, subscriptions we‚Äôd forgotten, coffee runs that added up. It wasn‚Äôt pretty, but at least it was clear.

Now, instead of blaming each other, we sit down once a week, open the page, and talk about what to adjust. We still don‚Äôt have it all figured out, but the arguments have turned into conversations. And honestly, that feels like progress.

Me and my friend hit it off great and became friends immediately at the start of the semester. We started spending every day together after class, studying and hanging out. One day she even says ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù out of the blue as we‚Äôre saying goodbye. I‚Äôve never had a friend say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù first, ever. We spent almost every single day throughout the school year together, almost inseparable.

Then summer came around and she got an internship in another state, so we stopped seeing each other. Now, I don‚Äôt have any other close friends like she does, and I have no family to talk to either. So I just spent the summer working with no one to talk to. My friend rarely responded to my messages, even if she was the one to text me first. My depression got pretty bad since I had no one to talk to, not even my best friend, and I even told her that. Yet she still didn‚Äôt find time to respond often.

At one point she wasn‚Äôt responding to me at all for almost two weeks, so I texted her asking if I had done something to upset her. She finally called me that night to say no, I hadn‚Äôt, and that she‚Äôs just a ‚Äúbad texter‚Äù and would call me again next week. During that call I told her how no one has really decided to talk to me first and how her not responding to my messages for days or weeks made me feel sad. She said sorry but said she‚Äôs been busy and got kinda defensive, like I‚Äôm not also dealing with a non-paid internship and a part time job. 

She never called me the next week. As a matter of fact, that one call was our last, and it‚Äôs been almost three months now.
But you know what she‚Äôs never too busy for? Posting about God. During times when I‚Äôm texting her asking how her summer is going, she won‚Äôt respond, but an hour later she‚Äôs made her daily post about God on social media. I‚Äôm telling her how lonely my summer has been and how stressful work is. Nothing for two days‚Äîbut she‚Äôll make two posts about random Bible verses and asking Jesus to forgive her sins.

To top it all off, she decided to take a break from school this semester. I didn‚Äôt find out until a week before school started. Even worse, I kinda knew about it for months from things she said in our last phone call, but I was waiting for her to confirm it herself. A week before school I finally asked her, and she confirmed it. She said she was going to tell me but was trying to figure some things out and meant to tell me sooner. 

For the past four weeks I‚Äôve been stressed out about her well-being. I offered to come visit her since I found a cheap train ticket, but she said no and that she‚Äôd come visit me in two weeks. This week was supposed to be that week, but she pretty much confirmed she‚Äôs not visiting. But then I get a notification that she‚Äôs made a new post‚Äîabout praying, reading the Bible, and drinking iced coffee to feel happier. Meanwhile, I texted her about how another person I was trying to be friends with at school dropped out, and she didn‚Äôt text me back, but she did post twice about God and praying.

I just don‚Äôt understand it. I‚Äôm real and I‚Äôm here. You said you love me like a brother and you can actually talk to me. Yet you make more time to post daily about Bible verses and how much you love God. I‚Äôm just done trying to have a conversation with her. If she wants to talk, she can text me first‚Äîwhich she rarely ever does. I just texted her first for the last time before I made this post. Saying I know she‚Äôs not coming down this week or next week but I hope she‚Äôs doing well. She probably won‚Äôt respond to that for a week since right before I sent that she made another post about loving and praying which triggered me to make this post here.

Was all set to question it, but I can see some people going for it--a MOMA\*-like knock-box contender (in matte white or black), with either a wood or sleek plastic-like lid.

https://preview.redd.it/by07m5lh95nf1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b84f7aa3455e7824aeaae89bc54734e579e0c63

Apart from its shape/form, it's a, well, knock-box--as Crema describes it, a (mostly plastic material) trash can on your counter.  At US$48-$55 (but really, is that all that bad, compared to some others?).  I do find it humorous that in the product/website information, not once does Crema actually show the inside of the knock-box in actual use, with pucks and coffee grounds mess in it.

I've wondered if knock-box contenders have left money on the table by not having disposable liners for their knock boxes--although there's the environmental waste factor there as well as, would people actually buy?

(And, no, I'm not affiliated with Crema in any way--I just enjoy new products, especially those with some flair.)

1n89dgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/KuwaitSingles/comments/1n89dgb/why_does_it_feel_like_hookup_culture_runs_kuwait/,Why Does It Feel Like Hookup Culture Runs Kuwait?,"I don‚Äôt know if anyone else feels this way, but sometimes it feels like Kuwait is built around hookups and nothing else. When people say ‚Äúdating,‚Äù they usually don‚Äôt mean going on actual dates, getting to know someone, or building something. They mean quick, secret, short-term meetups that never go anywhere.

I get why it‚Äôs like that. People here don‚Äôt want to be seen in public with someone new because they‚Äôre scared of being judged. Apps barely work‚Äîhalf the time nobody‚Äôs active, and the other half it‚Äôs just spam or people who aren‚Äôt serious. Social circles are small and tight, so you can‚Äôt really ‚Äúdate around‚Äù without everyone knowing your business. All of that makes casual hookups easier, because it requires less effort and less risk.

But at the same time, it feels like it leaves no space for people who do want something real. Not everyone wants to sneak around, not everyone wants temporary connections. Some people just want to grab coffee, go for a walk, and actually talk to someone. Some people want to see if there‚Äôs real compatibility without rushing into marriage, but also without it being treated like a scandal.

I honestly don‚Äôt believe everyone in Kuwait only wants hookups. I think there are plenty of people who are open to dating seriously, but they just don‚Äôt have the means or the space to do it. There‚Äôs nowhere to go, no platform that feels safe, and no culture that makes it easy. And so hookup culture becomes the ‚Äúdefault,‚Äù even for people who might secretly want more.

So I‚Äôm curious‚Äîwhat do you think? Is Kuwait really just a hookup place and nothing else, or are there people out there who actually want serious dating but are stuck in a system that doesn‚Äôt allow it?",1,1756990545.0,KuwaitSingles,3,1.0,False

It wasn‚Äôt really about the money‚Äîit was about the stress, the lack of control, and feeling like we weren‚Äôt on the same team.

We tried a bunch of things. Budgeting apps we forgot to open after a week. A messy Excel file that only one of us understood. Even scribbling notes in a paper notebook. Nothing stuck. Every system felt too complicated, and we‚Äôd fall back into the same cycle.

Out of pure frustration, we sat down one weekend and created something super simple‚Äîa single page to write down what we earn, what we spend, and what‚Äôs left. Nothing fancy, just a place we could both open and update.

1n89d0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1n89d0c/splitting_the_bill_on_the_first_date_is_the_only/,Splitting the bill on the first date is the only fair option.,"I‚Äôll never understand why people think the person who *asks* for the date (or usually the man) is ‚Äúobligated‚Äù to pay the entire bill. That mindset is outdated and kind of entitled.

If you‚Äôre genuinely interested in someone, why should the evening start off with one person essentially ‚Äúsponsoring‚Äù the other? That doesn‚Äôt feel like romance ‚Äî it feels like a transaction.

Also, dating is supposed to be about getting to know each other. If your entire impression of someone changes just because they didn‚Äôt cover your pasta and iced coffee, then maybe you weren‚Äôt looking for a partner‚Ä¶ you were looking for a free meal.

Splitting the bill is:

* Fair (you both ate, you both pay).
* Honest (no weird power dynamics).
* Respectful (treats both people like equals, not like someone owes the other).

And honestly, if someone is insulted by splitting the bill, it kind of shows they‚Äôre not really interested in *you* ‚Äî they‚Äôre interested in what they can *get* out of you.

If you want tradition, fine. But don‚Äôt dress up ‚ÄúI want free dinners‚Äù as ‚Äúromance.‚Äù",116,1756990514.0,unpopularopinion,260,0.72,False

A Cosy Cafe tea/coffee themed box. Cardamom Coffee shower gel, an Earl grey bath bomb and peach tea lotion would be immense. 

I'd love an earthy Forest Floor themed box. We have been waiting for a Tramp bath bomb for too long! Maybe some mushroomy themed goods and maybe a scrub that looks soil but smells amazing, like the experimenter. Maybe Autumn Leaf bath bomb. And of course anything Jungle scented. 

A really fragrant Persian inspired box with lots of fragrant ingredients like cardamom, aromatic rose, and even sweet mint. Maybe some infused dried rose petals to scatter on your bath. Maybe scents like sultana could be used and definitely definitely a return of the Figs & Honey bath bomb.

I'm excited to share our journey with mesquite coffee alternative - a caffeine-free brew made from wild-harvested seedpods in the Karoo region.

Unlike regular coffee, mesquite offers a smooth, nutty-caramel flavour without the jitters or acidity. It's packed with prebiotics, fibre, and minerals that support gut health and provide sustained energy.

What's your biggest coffee challenge? Caffeine sensitivity? Afternoon crashes? Digestive issues? I'd love to hear your experiences!

Last week I started on 5mg. I did two months on 2.5mg first pen lost 18lb, second pen lost 13lb. I really could have done with doing at least another month on 2.5mg but I skipped ahead and ordered a couple of 5mg, before the price hike even broke in the news so not panic buying i just had some spare money and thought id order them. I was sure after two months id be ready for 5mg. 

Anyway, I injected my first dose last Wednesday night and went to bed. Woke up the next day, nothing major, Bit of headache and body stiffness (like when I took my first 2.5mg or when I get flu shot) paracetamol and water - problem solved. I found the food noise was really ramped up, Dreaming of snacks and bad stuff but I still wasnt hungry and satiety was still really good. I expected to feel more hunger by day 5 and 6 like on 2.5mg. But I just didnt feel hungry all week, I wasn't eating lunch at work till like 17:00 cause I just wasn't hungry (despite the insane amount of food noise again) and then because it was so late I didnt want my evening meals. Out of the week, there has been only 2 days where I got close to my 1500cal a day, two days when I didnt even manage 950 cal (I know, I know its extremely bad) then the rest of the time it was more like 1100cals. Tues and yesterday I went to bed without my evening meal cause i simply wasn't hungry (despite food noise 24/7) I've been very active at work. This week as been the worst week for not getting the meals I need, since I started in july 10th. So how come I've put 1lb on? 

On 2.5mg I have always eaten breakfast, lunch (at a reasonable time) and evening meal. Granted i have had to set alarms for breakfast and lunch as a reminder but when I got the food I enjoyed it and managed it. 98% of the time i had consumed all my calories and was still losing weight,  I just can't get my head round the fact I ate even less on 5mg and put 1lb on.

Also on 2.5mg I had a fair bit of constipation but a cup of caffine coffee(im a decaff gal) extra fibre in my meals and gummies sorted it out every time. 5mg, I haven't been to the toilet since the day before I first jabbed 5mg (8 days) no amount of caffine, high fibre foods and gummies plus movicol, would get things moving. So this morning(two days off work) I used a glycerine suppository, hardly got things moving!

Its just so frustrating üò´  it really is!

Anyone else have a tough time on 5mg, and do you think I should have given it another go before chucking the towel in and dropping back to 2.5mg? I feel like a failure and done something wrong. 2.5mg was really a beautiful dose to me.",1,1756989729.0,UKMounjaro,3,0.6,False

Im a 28y female, extremely sedentary (I work from home and have admitted it made me lazy), and my diet was garbage. I was diagnosed on Tuesday after having upper right quadrant pain for about 2 months. I saw my PCP and gastro within those 2 months & was prescribed pantoprazole incase it was just GERD. I also had an endoscopy with biopsies done, all clear. I called the gastro a couple weeks ago and requested an ultrasound because it wasn‚Äôt making sense why it still hurt if it could have potentially been GERD and I was taking the meds as prescribed. Fast forward, ultrasound results show ‚Äúmild fatty infiltration of the liver‚Äù, 14.6 liver, and echogenicity is slightly increased. This was diagnosed Tuesday. Though it‚Äôs only been 3 days i‚Äôve changed my diet completely. Whole foods, no refined sugar, no refined carbs, i‚Äôve cut out coffee (I refuse to drink it black) and switched to green tea in the morning. started atleast 64 ounces of water a day. started going for atleast a 30 minute walk these past few days. I plan to stick with this lifestyle change because I don‚Äôt want my liver to progress, i‚Äôve read that it can be reversed with a lifestyle change but my question is, how quickly can it reverse. I‚Äôm going to work extremely hard to heal my liver and my body in general, but how long could it potentially take??

Old-fashioned,¬†off-key¬†and moving. This lasted for only 7 nights.*¬†

Case 12-0007¬†

Location:¬†Hollow Pines, county line.¬†

Status: Withdrawn¬†

Complainants described an ice-cream truck they¬†didn‚Äôt¬†order and¬†didn‚Äôt¬†want. The music¬†didn‚Äôt¬†play the full loop. It‚Ä¶ circled, like a moth along a light post. Same three bars. A jingle meant for daylight,¬†but when¬†left running after midnight¬†gave the townsfolk a far more sinister feel.¬†

¬†

Calls came from Spruce Bend, Harlan Ridge, and the new cul-de-sac¬†saddled up¬†to the shoulder of Route 7‚Äîwhere the forest¬†shades it like¬†vinyl blinds.¬†After the first visit, the changes in town were palpable. The mountain air¬†wore¬†thin. Yet the atmosphere became¬†heavy and damp. Dogs¬†wouldn‚Äôt¬†drink. The kids woke up humming a tune none of them had heard before.¬†

¬†

One mother‚ÄîLydia‚Äîsaid her son stood at his window, eyes open, but not‚Ä¶ present. She guided him back to bed. When she turned away, he was at the glass again, forehead to pane, like¬†he‚Äôd¬†been magnetized to the night.¬†

¬†

A night-shift mechanic on Harlan Ridge‚ÄîArturo ‚Äîheard the engine idle under a busted streetlight. Swore the light brightened, then dimmed, in time with the melody. When he stepped outside, there was only fog. And a slow drip from the transformer, like something had licked the electricity out of it.¬†

¬†

No plates reported. No driver described. Just that sound.¬†

Tin glockenspiel. Carousel in a fishbowl. Childhood through a cracked¬†kaleidoscope.¬†

¬†

¬†**The Stakeout**¬†¬†

By night four, the sheriff had a full inbox and a short fuse. He assigned rotating pairs to sit quiet in the target neighborhoods. ‚ÄúVisibility,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOptics.‚Äù Calm the town. Show the flag. Catch a bored teen with a Bluetooth speaker and a van that¬†should‚Äôve¬†been sent to the junkyard in ‚Äô98.¬†

¬†

We set double units in three zones. Different nights, different corners. Two-man cars, lights out, engines cold. No sirens unless we had eyes on the vehicle.¬†And ‚ÄúNo hero moves!‚Äù¬†

¬†

My partner that week was Morales. Good eyes, better instincts. We broke the shift with thermos coffee and a rule: no chatter unless it matters. Plenty to look at when you let a street be a street‚Äîpeople underestimate the shape a neighborhood makes at three in the morning. The trash cans lean. The curtains breathe. The cats hold the intersections like priests.¬†

Night one: nothing. The fog sat heavy. The air tasted like cold pennies.¬†

Night two: a couple of porch lights snapped on and off as if trying to blink away a dream.¬†

Night three: I started drawing the routes complainants described. Three loops, all skirts to the¬†tree line. If you put them on a map, they look like‚Ä¶ not circles. More like a clover...¬†

¬†

We moved to Spruce Bend on night four‚Äîedge of the¬†clover, where the road dead-ends into an old logging cut. We parked under a maple that had already given up half its leaves. 02:37, Morales tapped the glass. He¬†didn‚Äôt¬†look at me, he just angled his head like a dog listening down a hall.¬†

¬†¬†

There it was. So soft the ear makes it up. But the hair on my arms¬†didn‚Äôt¬†lie.¬†

‚ÄúSouth,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúTwo blocks.‚Äù¬†

¬†We¬†didn‚Äôt¬†move. Stakeout rules. Let the thing come to you.¬†

¬†It did.¬†

The melody grew, but it¬†didn‚Äôt¬†approach; it appeared, like sound that forgot to travel. The maple leaves trembled. An orange safety cone at the corner breathed, then held.¬†

¬†Then the truck turned onto Spruce Bend.¬†

¬†

**First Contact**¬†

Headlights low. No halogens. The old glass kind‚Äîthe kind that glow instead of cutting. Paint was the sickly white of over-bleached bone. The body looked¬†welded‚Äîcab¬†from one decade, box from another, all¬†logos had been scrubbed off like it had been given a solid once over from a chop shop.¬†

On the passenger door: a rectangle of adhesive ghosting where a decal had¬†once¬†lived. When the truck eased under a streetlight,¬†the light bathed it in such a way that it resembled a sheet ghost. If you stared, you could almost read‚Ä¶ something¬†on the side where the logos once were. I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†stare¬†long enough to know, but I snapped a picture.

¬†The¬†side panel flipped us as if to welcome its customers.¬†¬†

Just then, a¬†porch light came on at 132 Spruce. Then another, two houses down. Then the third. Not random. Sequential, like a path laying itself.¬†

¬†03:01. A boy‚Äîeight,¬†maybe¬†nine‚Äîopened¬†his front door. Bare feet. Pajama shorts. No coat. He¬†didn‚Äôt¬†look left or right. He held his hands close to his chest like he was keeping a moth from escaping. He walked past the lawn, past a forgotten scooter, past the paper like his eyes knew nothing but the horizon.¬†

¬†The truck¬†didn‚Äôt¬†beckon. The music¬†didn‚Äôt¬†change. The door was simply open, the night was simply a hallway, and the boy belonged at the end of it.¬†

The boy went to the window like he was going to place an order. We¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†see anyone¬†in side. It was pitch black aside from the outside lights. He nodded once then made his way to the back of the truck.¬†¬†

The¬†back door unlatched itself. No hands. No shadow. It rolled up like a yawn.¬†¬†

When his toes touched the bumper, the three-note phrase cut mid-loop.¬†

The light¬†outside the order window¬†went out.¬†

He climbed in.¬† There was a soft click.

¬†

No driver shifted gears. No¬†one could be seen moving inside. The truck¬†just¬†rolled forward, silent but for tires negotiating a shallow gutter.¬†It¬†didn‚Äôt¬†turn its lights¬†back on as it rounded the corner. The only light to be seen were the¬†taillights¬†melting into the night, like the¬†darkness¬†swallowed it whole.¬†

¬†""Call it,‚Äù¬†I¬†said.¬†

¬†‚ÄúHold,‚Äù¬†Morales replied.¬†‚ÄúSometimes you learn more letting a thing show you the end of its sentence.‚Äù¬†

¬†I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†like¬†it¬†but we tailed two blocks back, no lights. The truck¬†didn‚Äôt¬†speed. It¬†didn‚Äôt¬†slow. It took a right that¬†should‚Äôve¬†been a dead end and‚Ä¶¬†wasn‚Äôt.¬†¬†

¬†*We checked the¬†road¬†in¬†the¬†daylight.¬†The road abruptly stopped at an old stone fence.¬†Surrounded by blackberry thorns.¬†¬†But that night, it was a street.*¬†One where¬†we¬†lost¬†the truck¬†at the¬†tree¬†line.¬†



‚ÄúUnit Three, visual lost,‚Äù Morales said.¬†

‚ÄúCopy,‚Äù dispatch said. ‚ÄúAny units have eyes?‚Äù¬†

No one did.¬†

I slammed my hand on the dash, a child was possibly just abducted and we had nothing!

We looped the Ridge twice. Nothing. The fog folded back over the hole the truck had made, and the night closed like a book¬†with a cliffhanger ending.¬†

¬†

**The Morning After**¬†¬†

At first light we knocked at 132. The mother answered, squinting into the day like it¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†hers yet.¬†¬†

""Good¬†morning,¬†ma‚Äôam. Do you have a moment to talk?‚Äù¬†

She looked at us puzzled. ‚ÄúWhat on Earth could you¬†possibly want¬†to talk about at dawn? Is everyone okay?‚Äù¬†¬†

¬†‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, it‚Äôs about your so....‚Äù I trailed off as a little boy came padding down the hall.¬†The boy stood behind her knee, humming. 

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mind me asking¬†ma‚Äôam,¬†how many children do you have?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúJust my son, Lucas. Officer what is this about?‚Äù She asked impatiently.¬†¬†

I exchanged¬†looks with Morales, then looked back at the kid. He¬†didn‚Äôt¬†seem troubled.¬†Didn‚Äôt¬†appear cold.¬†No dirt on his feet. He blinked at us and smiled the way kids smile when¬†they‚Äôve¬†been¬†promised a treat and¬†they‚Äôre¬†trying to be¬†patient.¬†¬†

She ushered us into the foyer as we explained about the odd vehicle driving around the neighborhood and what we were doing about.¬†¬†

As the kid listened to us talk to his mother, I noticed something odd. He was humming three notes. Like the ones from last night. Same intervals.¬†Just a different key.¬†¬†

When I asked him what he was humming, he said, ‚ÄúI¬†don‚Äôt¬†know.¬†It‚Äôs¬†older than cartoons.‚Äù¬†His mother smiled and patted his head.¬†

Almost on¬†cue,¬†I smelled freezer burn.¬†I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†smell it behind me or on Morales. I only smelled it when the boy wandered¬†close to me.¬†¬†

I asked the mother if they¬†were having issues with their freezer. She stared at me befuddled‚Äî¬†‚ÄúWhat a question to ask before coffee?‚Äù‚ÄîShe shook her head. ‚ÄúWe¬†aren‚Äôt.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†

Morales nudged my¬†shoulder and¬†looked down at the kid. ‚ÄúWell good, eh slugger? That way the ice cream¬†won‚Äôt¬†melt.‚Äù¬†I could tell this was his way to end the conversation before I asked anymore awkward questions.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lactose¬†intolerant.‚Äù¬†His mother said as we turned to go.¬†¬†

She looked at the boy. He stopped humming. His mouth kept the shape of the note. For a long second.¬†

‚ÄúAlthough I did find evidence in the¬†kitchen sink¬†that tells me someone will have a tummy ache later.‚Äù She said¬†chastising Lucas.¬†

I¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†help myself. ‚ÄúPardon?‚Äù¬†¬†

She looked from Morales to me. ‚ÄúOh, one of his cousins must have given him an¬†ice cream¬†yesterday. I found¬†a single wooden¬†ice¬†cream¬†stick laying¬†on the¬†drying rack.¬†Chocolate ice cream stilled stained on the stick.‚Äù¬†

Now it was Morales‚Äôs turn to get an odd look. ‚ÄúDo you mind if we see that?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúUhhh sure?‚Äù¬†

She disappeared to the kitchen. When she returned, she handed us the stick in¬†question.¬†It was a brand I¬†didn‚Äôt¬†recognize. Language I¬†didn‚Äôt, either.¬†

‚ÄúWhat¬†brand is this?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúNo clue,¬†it was¬†probably¬†from the cousins,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey get a lot of gamer brand products off the internet.‚Äù¬†

We left with nothing to write that¬†wouldn‚Äôt¬†get edited¬†or our sanity questioned.¬†

¬†

**The Contagion**

¬†

Calls spread.¬†The areas in which the truck was heard grew wider. Each¬†new¬†neighborhood on the map, the department scrambled to add more double units.¬†People complained about sleep‚Äîabout waking with the taste of metal under the tongue, about dreams that smelled like antifreeze and sugar.¬†

The local gas company checked¬†15¬†homes¬†who called with complaints of odd smells. No leaks. Power company replaced a transformer at the corner of Spruce and Harlan. The new one hummed when the air was still.¬†But on¬†damp¬†nights, it kept time¬†like a¬†metronome.¬†

We tried¬†more¬†stakeouts¬†with staggered times and overlapping fields. We logged everything‚ÄîLITERALLY EVERYTHING,¬†temperature dips, streetlight behavior, patterns in the jingle. I recorded thirty seconds on a pocket¬†recorder¬†that survived worse than¬†this¬†weather. When I played it back, there was only tape hiss and three thumps like something knocked inside the recorder‚Äôs plastic shell. When Morales held it, the thumps¬†weren‚Äôt¬†there. When I held it again, they were back, and closer.¬†¬†

On night six, at¬†0319¬†hours, the truck returned to Spruce Bend. Same approach. Same lights. The¬†flap flipped open for business. Exterior lights turned on.¬†No driver.¬†

This time, no child walked out.¬†

Perhaps all¬†of our warnings had worked.¬†

A front door did open‚Äîthree houses to the left of 132‚Äîand then closed. A minute passed. Two. No one came down the steps. The truck waited patiently.¬†When the porch light finally went out,¬†the truck¬†pulled away from the curb as if attached to an¬†ethereal¬†tether hidden by the fog.¬†

We followed one turn, then another, then a third that never existed. Tires on gravel that¬†wasn‚Äôt¬†there yesterday.¬†The sound of¬†crunching¬†gravel drowned out by the blood rushing in our ears. Our own breathing¬†became so loud it smothered the sound of the engine. It was a sensory overload.¬†And then a¬†pop¬†as the truck punctured the last bit of fog and was swallowed whole into the night.¬†

¬†

**Aftershock**¬†¬†

Not everything leaves a body behind. Some things leave‚Ä¶¬†edits.¬†¬†

The next morning, many homes awoke¬†to find their freezers¬†open emitting sub- freezing¬†temperatures.¬†¬†Certainly not the manufacturer default¬†and none of them owned¬†a¬†model¬†that could go that low in¬†temperature.¬†

An unfortunate few also found their young children had emptied out these freezers and made a makeshift bed inside. Thankfully, all¬†were¬†immediately¬†seen at¬†the hospital and only one or two suffered any type of frost bite.¬†

However,¬†those are the house that later found their¬†photo frames had shifted by a thumb width, leaving squares of unfaded wall behind their new positions. In those frames, faces angled a degree to the left. Teeth showed where lips ought to have stayed.¬†¬†

At¬†house¬†132,¬†where we swore¬†that¬†we saw the boy enter the truck, he finally stopped¬†humming.¬†On night seven, just around the time the truck vanished into the abyss.¬†¬†

The quiet¬†didn‚Äôt¬†feel like a victory, though. It felt like the end of a game the child¬†didn‚Äôt¬†realize¬†he‚Äôd¬†lost.¬†¬†

We never found tracks¬†for the truck.¬†There¬†were no plates to run. We never saw a driver‚Äôs silhouette.¬†No suspect description.¬†The¬†photo of the¬†adhesive ghost on the door, under streetlight, finally yielded a word¬†the night¬†after it vanished‚ÄîCreamery‚Äîand a partial telephone number that¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†exist anymore. The area code belonged to a town¬†over¬†that died when the plant closed, and the river took the road back a few feet each spring.¬†

¬†

**Follow-Up**¬†

Officially: no suspect¬†identified; no evidence of abduction; no crime verified. ‚ÄúCommunity reassurance patrols conducted.‚Äù That language is good at covering the bones of a story that makes the wrong people nervous.¬†

The sheriff closed the¬†case; the town reopened its eyes; the fog lifted like it always does when the mountain remembers how to breathe.¬†

Unofficially: we put out word on informal channels. Told the night shift to kill music on approach to the Ridge. Asked folks to bring their kids back from the windows when they hear songs that belong to heat and daylight, after dusk. Word was left for a select few on a forum:¬†

But if you stand in the last cul-de-sacs¬†where the houses run out and the woods resume their sentence, and you wait past the hour that turns a night into a mistake, you can hear three notes try to find the fourth.¬†¬†



Stay inside after midnight. Keep your freezers shut.¬†

And if the music finds your street‚Äîdon‚Äôt¬†hum along.¬†

1n88umi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Forward_Spread_5127/comments/1n88umi/best_social_media_management_in_anna_nagar/,"Best Social Media Management in Anna Nagar, Chennai (Expert Social Media Handler in Anna Nagar)","**Why Digital Visibility is the New Competitive Edge in Anna Nagar**

Anna Nagar has grown into one of Chennai‚Äôs most dynamic commercial hubs. Whether it‚Äôs the buzzing eateries along Shanthi Colony, the fashion boutiques on 2nd Avenue, or the fitness studios near Tower Park, every corner is filled with businesses vying for customer attention.

But here‚Äôs the shift: competition is no longer just about **foot traffic**‚Äîit‚Äôs about **screen presence**. Before stepping out, people are already exploring options on Instagram, checking reviews on Facebook, or browsing WhatsApp updates to decide where to eat, shop, or unwind.

This is why **social media management is a necessity, not a luxury.** It‚Äôs about more than just pretty posts‚Äîit‚Äôs about building a system that grabs attention, earns trust, and transforms casual scrollers into paying customers.

**How Professional Social Media Management Transforms Anna Nagar Businesses**

Partnering with a skilled social media expert can create measurable impact for local brands. Instead of just gaining likes, your business can see real growth in reach, reputation, and revenue.

Here‚Äôs what you gain:

* **Expanded Reach** ‚Äì Tap into thousands of potential customers living and working around Anna Nagar.
* **Revenue Growth** ‚Äì Well-designed campaigns drive both walk-ins and online sales.
* **Trustworthy Image** ‚Äì A clean, professional-looking feed gives customers confidence in your brand.
* **Steady Engagement** ‚Äì Consistent posting ensures your business stays visible in crowded digital spaces.
* **Cultural Connection** ‚Äì Posts tied to Chennai festivals, slang, and local trends feel authentic and relatable.
* **Saved Time & Effort** ‚Äì While you manage daily operations, your social media expert ensures your online presence thrives.

With the right strategy, social media becomes more than promotion‚Äîit becomes the **engine that powers your business growth in Anna Nagar.**

**Branding: The Secret Ingredient for Long-Term Success in Anna Nagar**

Discounts may bring customers through the door once, but **branding is what keeps them coming back.** In a place like Anna Nagar, where caf√©s, salons, boutiques, and gyms are everywhere, the businesses that survive aren‚Äôt just the cheapest‚Äîthey‚Äôre the ones that people **connect with emotionally.**

**Why Branding Outshines Discounts**

* **Promotions are temporary** ‚Äì A Deepavali discount or Aadi Sale may boost sales for a week, but the effect fades quickly.
* **Branding builds permanence** ‚Äì A strong, consistent brand identity ensures your business remains top-of-mind all year round.
* **Emotional connection wins** ‚Äì Customers don‚Äôt return because you gave them ‚Çπ100 off‚Äîthey return because your brand feels reliable, relatable, and valuable.

**Key Branding Outcomes from Social Media**

1. **Memorability** ‚Äì A boutique with a cohesive Instagram aesthetic becomes instantly recognizable, even months later.
2. **Authority** ‚Äì A fitness studio that shares daily tips and success stories becomes a trusted name in Anna Nagar‚Äôs wellness space.
3. **Differentiation** ‚Äì Among 20 restaurants in Shanthi Colony, the one with a unique brand voice on social media will stand out.
4. **Customer Loyalty** ‚Äì People choose brands they trust, not just the ones offering the biggest discounts.

**Real-Life Examples in Anna Nagar**

* A **caf√© near Tower Park** that posts cozy interiors and coffee art builds a brand as the go-to hangout spot.
* A **jewelry store in Shanthi Colony** showcasing heritage designs online creates an image of tradition and authenticity.
* A **salon on 2nd Avenue** highlighting real customer makeovers builds credibility and repeat visits.

 Bottom line: **Sales may keep the cash register ringing, but branding builds the foundation for growth.** Social media gives Anna Nagar businesses the stage to tell their story, showcase their values, and earn customer loyalty far beyond a one-time discount.

1. ‚Å†Encore ESP: setting 20 (no shims installed)
2. ‚Å†18 grams of coffee (i measure after grinding)
3. ‚Å†The shot started from the middle, then after widening a bit, I started to see shot coming through the edges.

My issue is, that it took roughly 35 seconds to pull from pressing the button to end. I think that is quite good time to extract. How ever it is not coming out evenly suggesting to me with limited knowledge I should grind it finer.

I tried second pull with grinding setting of 14. Not a drastic change I thought. However, now it took over a minute and coffee never formed a stream, it just dropped all over the filter. I got maybe little less spraying, but it was still messy.

Any suggestions? My thinking is that 20 is quite close to good on grind level, but how to get rid if that spray? I will try levels between 14-20 tomorrow when I will drink my next cups of coffee.",3,1756989078.0,espresso,18,1.0,False

I remember this interaction 

I am not a morning person and typically avoid being up or out of my room in the mornings unless we have something going on. Alarms don't work well in my family so I'm often the night owl that wakes my family. I don't mind. I'll brew coffee and get them at the specified time 

But once my mother had to get up reaaally early to take my brother to work. He hates waking her so I started doing it. I was up anyway so whatever that's fine. Mom prefers how I wake her anyway

I do the nightly chores. Dishes and even wipe the counters. I made coffee right before waking my mom. I go and wake her. I say "" hello mom. Good morning. It is ( time ). The coffee is brewing "" as I normally did. She gets up. I go to the kitchen to get a drink before going off to my goblin dwelling but my mom enters the kitchen and gives me some attitude and a stink face ?- I didn't get why ? There is coffee. I did the dishes. The counters weren't perfect but they were better. She skips her coffee this time around and just goes outside. I get my own drink and go to my room

I don't really see her the rest of the day as I eventually pass out then I go out at like 2 pm nearly 3 ( don't judge me ) and she's happily talking to me brother then she sees me and gives me a very annoyed / mad face again. I walk to the kitchen and hear them continue talking. I go to walk by to get back to my room when she makes that face again. So I ask her what. She acts like she doesn't know what I'm talking about. So I tell her how she's been acting like since this morning 

And it finally comes out "" Well. You did not tell ne good morning this morning. ""

I was...fucking floored. Excuse me ? I absolutely did. I tell her I did. She sighs and says she must not have heard me. I am still completely confused because what ?- I ask her if that's it and it was. So now I practically drown her in good mornings and she asked me why once and I told her this story. She was sorry when I told her. Which it's fine but it's just what I think of every shitty morning because that lasted all day. ALL DAY. I just can't because what ????? I don't know I'm just tired.

1n88pkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1n88pkt/my_experience_and_recovery/,My Experience and Recovery,"First I want to say that I have lurked and read A LOT of posts and stories here.  This community really helped me in my darkest hour.  I never posted while going through this experience but vowed to return and tell my story if and when I made progress / recovery. This will likely be long as I plan to really recount my journey up to now. (3 months from June 4th to now.) 

As of today I have basically recovered. I think alcohol gives me some very mild muscles sensitivity but I am back to all of the sports I love.  I haven't gone ""hard"" at anything other than walking (20,000 steps a day) and will not run or lift weights until the 6 month mark out of an abundance of caution.  I drink coffee.  I won't be taking steroids, FQs or NSAIDs for the forseeable future.

**Background**: 37 year old American living in rural Japan. Highly active before floxing (hiking, badminton, snowboarding, biking).  
I had taken fluoroquinolones here after a pretty severe stomach surgery the year prior (fistula and resection of intestine) as well as after another stomach infection 6 months before that. These were the first and only times I have taken FQs before my floxing.  I don't recall having any problems from them at those times.

  
I realized i was floxed on my 37th birthday, June 4th.  Exactly 3 months ago. In late May I came down with what i thought was an ordinary cold.  The cold went away but I developed an ear infection the likes of I had never experienced before.  I had a history of ear infections in my childhood and have suffered from sinus pressure / sinusitis many times, mainly affecting my nose. This ear infection got weird fast.  I developed mild hyperacusis symptoms and tinnitus that just didn't seem to go away. I had never experienced these before and I ran to the ENT on May 27th. 

My nose was fine and my ears looked they had some inflammation according to him, but i was still feeling clogged and had these ear issues.  So he believed I had a bacterial infection of some kind in the inner ear. He prescribed me:

**a nasal corticosteroid, an expectorant and Geninax,** a FQ that I believe after researching is only used in Japan.  I actually looked up the FQ and saw that it was a ""quinolone"". I had already been familiar with FQs because of my previous medical problems but went ahead with taking it cause, you know, I was prescribed it.  No one said anything about side effects at the doctor's office or pharmacy. 

I was prescribed **5 days of 10 400mg pills each of Geninax (2 a day)** and told to take it along with the nasal spray and expectorant, and then come back a week later. After a week, i was feeling great and basically back to normal. I had even felt good enough to do a bike ride that weekend. A week later, June 3rd (Tuesday), I went back for my followup. I did a hearing test and got checked by the doctor. He thought I still had some inflammation and prescribed me another 4 days of FQs just to make sure everything cleared up. That night I took the two more pills.

The next day, June 4th, was when I realized I was floxed.  At work around noon I was just walking around and noticed my calves were stiff. Like out of nowhere.  Due to my research I realized it had to be the pills or something.  For the next 24 hours I basically had as much of a freakout as one could have. By nightfall I had developed:

**Symptoms**: nerve pain and sensations around my body, depersonalization, tendon pain in my calves, butt and hamstrings, muscle pain all over, terrible dry mouth, severe anxiety and a lack of hunger. (I later developed insomnia, eye floaters, arm and hand weakness (I could barely lift my phone at times), and the inability to sweat. These symptoms were at their worst the first month. Note: my insomnia was mainly the kind where I would sleep normally at first but then wake up around 3 or 4 hours later and not be able to sleep at all. I saw this was common for many folks here.

The first night I couldn't sleep.  I think I stayed up all night and read most of this subreddit.  Just endless researching and trying to figure out what was happening. Luckily by the next night I must have exhausted myself or something because I basically crashed and managed to sleep. When I woke, the de personalization and severe anxiety (I felt like I was going to actually die) were gone.  

I went to the hospital after two days (Friday) I saw an orthopedist who said to take it easy for three days an Id probably be fine... I didn't believe him.

Unfortunately I had scheduled a trip to see my girlfriend in Nagoya that weekend and I could still walk, albeit gingerly at that point. My nerve and muscle pain were intermittent and I thought seeing her would cheer me up and take my mind off the situation.  Walking around was tough and I probably should not have gone but I did it anyway. We still managed to have a good time and she really tried to understand my situation even though it was hard for me to explain just what was happening to me.

Upon my return, I could really only focus on being healthy.  I ordered a ton of supplements thanks to this sub. Unfortunately, every type of magnesium I tried seemed to make me feel worse. Same with calcium and others.  I still took Vitamin C, Fish Oil and a B complex (no b6). I decided to consume as much magnesium as I could through my diet. What helped was daily avocado, nuts and quinoa.  I avoided all sweets, caffeine and alcohol. I also ordered collagen peptides which really seemed to help (I still take them daily).

In the first month I averaged about 4,000 steps a day. I had to walk this many everyday due to work and tried to go on longer walks every night even if it was just a little.

By July 4th I was seeing some progress.  I had incorporated daily baths and tried to go to an onsen (hot spring) and sauna at least twice a week. By 5 weeks I realized I was sweating again and that was a HUGE relief.  Many symptoms were gone including, dry mouth, neuropathy, most muscle pain and butt and hamstring pain. I mainly had calve issues and arm issues only by this point.

The weekend of July 14th I went on a trip to visit a friend with my girlfriend in Sapporo and I was able to walk about 10,000 steps a day. By the end of the night on Saturday my legs were killing me and I had to take it easy for another week after coming home. (5,000 steps a day again).

By the end of July I was feeling much better and really couldn't believe it. In late July I was able to go on a week long road trip with a friend and go camping.  I still had insomnia but that miraculously went away by July 28th. I remember struggling to go back to sleep one night and then the next I just slept normally and haven't had a single issue since then. I did experience extreme arm soreness from driving for many hours on that trip.  This lasted about 2 days and I haven't experienced it since.

In August I successfully went on a 10 day trip abroad with my girlfriend and managed 20,000 steps a day!  Every day!  Since then I have been just living a normal life. 

I'm still overwhelmed at my progress and still try to eat healthy and take care of myself. Looking forward to ramping things up overtime and hopefully returning to snowboarding and snowshoeing in the winter.

I really hope everyone reading this overcomes their FQ issues.  I really do.  I read the three success story posts countless times and it was a big source of inspiration to keep going. I know I'm extremely lucky and that my case was mild compared to others. I'm planning to continue monitoring my situation carefully until the 6 month mark and I might post an update then.

Hello, last night I was waiting for an Uber on the sidewalk out front between Coffee Time and California Sandwiches at the corner of Sheppard and Chesswood, and accidentally left my sunglasses case behind.

It's an Oakley sunglasses case with glasses inside and I will pay $200 to the person who finds them and reaches out.

I appreciate any other ideas people may have to help me find them. I tried calling the business around but they are either not open yet or not answering.",1,1756988519.0,lostandfoundTO,0,1.0,False
1n88lwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n88lwl/my_heart_is_a_total_mess/,My heart is a total mess,"He broke up with me 13 days ago. After 4 ¬Ω years. He was my life, my soulmate, the one with whom I wanted to grow old, my everything, my best friend. The connection was magical. I couldn't believe my luck and thanked God/destiny/whatever to have met a man like this after years of shitty relationships. I know this sounds cheesy. But we were so good together. Same level of intelligence, same humour, same thoughts about life, kids, marriage, same values. Same need for closeness and distance. It was no problem to say ‚Äúhey, I need some time for myself‚Äù. He always understood. And I gave him the same space when he needed it. We are in our 30s, so I thought we are experienced enough to see that relationships also need space. There was no pressure. Because I knew he‚Äôd come back. In this relationship I felt seen, heard, and taken seriously. Something I did not have in previous relationships. He made an effort to answer even my dumbest questions with sincerity and honesty. He checked every box for me. The was the most beautiful man I have ever seen. 

We were long distance (6 hours by car or train), but we made it work. I need a lot of space for myself, which he respected, because he is the same. So this was a good relationship. Apart, but together. My job allowed flexibility, so I could be with him and work remote, or he came to see me when I had time off. He is in the military so he was gone a lot, but I felt that it worked out because we were chatting all the time and stayed in contact. I honestly never felt that this was a problem. It‚Äôs not easy to be with a soldier, but I supported him where I could, understood that there are a lot of uncertainties that come with this job, and I never worried about him cheating on me. Trusted him 100%. I missed him dearly, but I was always looking forward to him coming back. And the distance was easy to endure, because we talked so much and kept close contact, even when he was a continent away. I tried to support him when he was struggling with his job, his colleagues, just listen and be there. Just be a rock for him.

He is on the spectrum, so he had a difficult time sometimes to experience and identify feelings and tell what he felt. I tried to be understanding, to learn, to hear him, ask him what he need, check in with him or leave him alone when he needed it. He was actually the first one to say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. I was the only one allowed to touch and hug him. That was a great honor. When we had our first kiss, he said that he could look me in the eyes (something he really struggles with) and that it feels good. I felt special. 

I lost my job last year and have been job hunting since January, without much success. That took a toll on my self-worth. I am in Germany so we get unemployment benefits for one year. There was a lot of pressure in the last months to find a job again. I worried a lot about having to move, about not finding anything again. I was stressed, and looking back now, I was quite negative very often. But everything was still good, because he was in my life. That gave me safety. And I tried not to let my sorrow show too much. 

Then there was a job I applied for, that was simply perfect for me and my skills, which would have solved all of my problems. The rejection came on August 21, and that was a real punch in the gut. I cried a lot that day, and he tried to comfort me on the phone, but I did not want to hear it.

He broke up with me on August 23. I never saw it coming. That day he was visiting me in my city, we had a normal day, laughed, did some stuff together, went for a walk, to our favorite coffee place, then he cooked dinner and it was an overall nice day. After I had done the dishes and we were cuddling on the couch, I noticed that his heart was beating very fast. What‚Äôs up? I asked. He got up and said, I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this, but I want to break up with you.

My fucking world collapsed. Why? Why?? He felt that he could not give me what I needed. That I needed someone to be there more often, who can support me better. That he felt hemmed in, that I have been so negative lately, and that he is very much in need for harmony, and that when we speak, he feels that he cannot be himself. That he felt different towards me since the beginning of the year, and that he carried the decision to break up around for three weeks or so. That he is sorry for breaking my heart. Then he packed his things and left.

I have been a mess since then. I have never experienced grief like this. Total and utter grief and despair. My heart has been ripped out. I miss him so much. I cry a lot. I barely function. 

In hindsight there were some signs. He did not say it back anymore when I told him I loved him. I asked him to give me a compliment now and then, which he didn‚Äôt. Maybe he couldn‚Äôt? Maybe he was overwhelmed by my need for his support? His silence confirmed my fears of being undesirable, of not being worthy of love. I think I put a lot of pressure on him. I feel terrible that I did not see clearer that he was struggling, too. Why did he not talk to me so we could find a solution? Why did he not trust me enough? What did I do wrong? I know that I have been ‚Äúneedy‚Äù for the past months, *but it is a phase*, and I haven‚Äôt been like this in the other years of our relationship. Doesn't that count for anything? Why throw it all away?

I honestly don‚Äôt know how to get through this. I did pack his things away, we did not have any contact since then. My heart‚Äôs a mess. I miss him so much. Worst thing is that I had a job interview today and it looks like an opportunity to get back in the work force. Which I should be happy about. But I can‚Äôt, because I cannot tell him.",1,1756988458.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1n88ltd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARG/comments/1n88ltd/buckshot_roulette_arg_status/,Buckshot Roulette ARG status?,"Hey all, first time poster to this subreddit! Please go easy on me, this is my first time getting into ARG‚Äôs üòÖ

So I know I‚Äôm a bit late to the party, but I recently saw a Game Theory video on Buckshot Roulette and it really sparked my interest in the overall ARG. I did some preliminary digging, I even did some of the ARG stuff on my own, and I really started getting invested in the mystery! However, I‚Äôve hit a wall, and it seems like no one is talking about this ARG anymore, as of a little less than a year ago, which is quite disheartening. 

I‚Äôve made my way into the Archive folder, and there‚Äôs so much cool lore dumped in these files! Unfortunately, there are passwords locking me from accessing ‚ÄúLegal Cases‚Äù and ‚ÄúCoffee Refill Invoices‚Äù, and I can‚Äôt find any information anywhere online regarding accessing these passwords. I‚Äôm convinced they‚Äôre connected to Liz‚Äôs puzzle letter to John, which I will write here:

ForJohn 
Four numbers lie hidden in sorrow and blood,
Three in booming shots and an essence swept by the flood.
Where does the dancing blazing below entwine?
Only in misery will you see cosmic shine.

We already know that Dante‚Äôs Inferno has a lot of symbolic importance in Buckshot Roulette, so I‚Äôm sure some of the answers I‚Äôm looking for are hidden away in there, somewhere. Perhaps there is more info hidden in other connected games or even Buckshot Roulette itself. And another interesting tidbit is that the corrupted database dump progress bar can be clicked on, which redirects us to the same password log-in that‚Äôs used for the ‚ÄúCoffee Refill Invoices‚Äù file. Not sure if THAT is as important, but it was an interesting detail nonetheless.

If anyone has any more info regarding this ARG, I‚Äôd love to hear about it! But I‚Äôm genuinely worried this ARG is dead, given the complete lack of online information. The latest YouTube video I‚Äôve seen is from 9 months ago, and it doesn‚Äôt explain anything beyond the locked archive files. Anyways, sorry to bother you all with a potentially dead ARG, but I figured it was worth a shot to reach out!

I don‚Äôt even know what to say really, I guess I‚Äôm using this platform to get my thoughts straight. 

Basically, I‚Äôm in a relationship and have been and live with him and we‚Äôve been planning to buy a house together after nine years. 

We are not married, or anything like that. 

I really don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm trying to say here. 

I know that he says and does things that are not kind or empathic. I‚Äôm very aware that there have been situations and moments that can be considered abusive. I also know that i ve wanted to leave him due to this more than a few times. I also feel lonely a lot of the time.

He mostly likes to yell at me, and call me things, tells me to shut the fuck up all the time. And everything is alway my fault or smth I should‚Äôve prevented. I often don‚Äôt feel like he understands me. We are not American or English, but basically he likes to call me pig, and bitch, but also whore or cancerous cunt, calls me useless a lot and unclean. He also says stuff like, if you continue like this you‚Äôll see me angry.. so that I give him what he wants I suppose. It‚Äôs mostly words, but he‚Äôs smacked things my way, and towers over me, and held my arm one time that it bruised. He cried. 

Besides this I feel the need to defend him, to be nice about him. Cause as far as I know, my whole body loves him and cares for him and his wellbeing. He isn‚Äôt always like this and he‚Äôs a lot of good for me. He‚Äôs been here for a very long times, I trust him with my live. And I don‚Äôt like every topic he talks about but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessary also. We have fun, we do things, we laugh, he‚Äôs who I want to see at the end of the day. I can‚Äôt sleep when he‚Äôs not there. 

These two feelings about him live next to each other, like it‚Äôs two different people, two brains but they walk next to each other constantly. I‚Äôve been sad about him since 2018, and still I‚Äôve loved him since before. 

I realized that my family doesn‚Äôt like him, they always say things like oh yeah he likes to talk about cars and we do not or stuff like that. So to me, that is just a preference it‚Äôs not a defect in someone. So I felt like everyone can be cordial, you know. You can be more small talk lvl. 

I also know that I‚Äôve tried to not tell them everything or show everything as they already do not like him and it wouldn‚Äôt solve anything. 

And, I don‚Äôt think your whole family has to like someone. 

Recently we went on a vacation to try and better it, with the whole family. And I‚Äôm so lame, but after it I had a good feeling. Like it was akward but not wrong you know. 

And also, that they didn‚Äôt hear everything he said to me. üòÇ gosh what am I even saying. 

Basically, he was nice and tried to be cordial and I thought everyone did it back and yes sometimes he wanted to get a coffee at a place my family didn‚Äôt. And he made jokes nobody liked, but I can‚Äôt be angry with bad jokes. You know. 

There was one instance, where we had drank, were playing a game outside and were supposed to cook dinner afterwards. And while the two of us were playing. The others, a big chunk, went to play pingpong. So, basically, after our game, I wanted to go over there and look at the match. And he said he felt akward and that we were supposed to make dinner. And I said, a bit drunk, a well do that later let‚Äôs go to the game, and then he was angry with me, told me to listen en to not be stupid, but I went to watch the match anyways. And the he stormed away to the bathroom. 

It‚Äôs very silly, right. After a short bit, I went to the table as it was getting dark and indeed we had to cook dinner. He started to berate me, how I‚Äôm a selfish asshole and a cunt and this and that and that I‚Äôm a terrible person and idk all this kinds of things. And he just kept saying this, again and again while we were cooking. And I told him to stop. He also said that he‚Äôs glad we didn‚Äôt buy the house yet cause he could never with such a bitch like me. My mom was close by but she had earphones in. And I thought maybe a gf of a brother was in a tent close by. But my boyfriend was whispering insults to me.   And honestly I thought nobody heard. 

Everyone ate dinner and I went to bed without talking to him again, 100% planning to break up with him. How dare he speak to me like that in my vacation with my family. 

He said sorry later like a whole day, that he felt like I didn‚Äôt listen to his feelings of being awkward with game sports and that I should‚Äôve waited and listened to him. 

Idk.

I forgot about it again. 

Later on I asked him if he had a key I needed, but he was in the bathroom. So I asked if he was there and if he had the key. And he said yes but to leave him, And appearently my brother‚Äôs gf was in the stall next to him. And she came to me and told me that he had said that I should fuck off and that I didn‚Äôt deserve that. And I hadn‚Äôt even heard him say that. 

Those are the main things. And I still feel like it went okay. And I‚Äôm so aware maybe how dumb that is. Of myself. 

Basically my brother called me last night. That everyone agrees, from what they‚Äôve seen that he‚Äôs borderline abusive, and that I should find someone who‚Äôs always kind to me and shows empathy and that everyone feels this way. And that nobody knows how to say it to me, that all the gfs hate him, even the ones he just met. That they don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm happy. And that they want better for me. I tried to ask what they base it one and he wasn‚Äôt there so he was like it‚Äôs the way he talks to you, presents himself. We can‚Äôt imagine what he says to you when we are not there. 

They think I‚Äôm staying because of rent or money or things like that. And now they want to help me, with a lot of money, so that I can get a mortgage that‚Äôs enough for me or that I can share with my brother. And they‚Äôre not crazy rich parents.  And they‚Äôve always said they can‚Äôt help us all, in that big way. And my brother thinks I should take it, and understand that it‚Äôs not about the money but about my life. 

And I honestly, don‚Äôt know what to do

The only moment I think about breaking up is when he‚Äôs angry and outside of that I don‚Äôt want it. And right now he‚Äôs normal, kind, safe, and I know in the back of my head that he‚Äôll be different again. But not right now. And I‚Äôm just like, if I consider the thought to my parents they know I feel like this and they‚Äôll never accept him.  If I talk to them about this option, they know. And if I break up with him it‚Äôs because of money, or a house and either way. 

They said it should start to be a conscious decision and I don‚Äôt know how.  

It‚Äôs like, lose and lose..

Personally I have done it and I would say it was the most spiritual and mind-blowing experience of my entire life till now. Along the lines of what Steve jobs said about psychedelics as ""one of the few important things he had done In his life"". I have never seen a single trip report or even a person telling me that they want to quit doing it or never liked or enjoyed it. Is it mostly the misconception about it?

Few things you should know about drugs before judging something.

Mainly few categories like
Opioids: painkillers which act on opioid receptors which is highly nd highly addictive.

Cannabis : acts on cannabinoid receptors which is also addictive but not as much as hard drugs

Psychedelic (magic mushrooms/lsd/dmt): alters perception and induce hallucinations in a very beautiful and mind-blowing way if your set and setting is good

Now Comparing mushrooms to opioids is like saying coffee is the same as alcohol - they both change how we feel, but they act on completely different systems in the brain.‚Äù

Shrooms don't cause physical dependence like opiods or hard drugs. They are not in the same recreational/relaxant category as weed either. They have been used in many cultures for spiritual and therapeutic reasons, not as ""party drugs"".

Our body doesn't develop any withdrawal for it ...just pure science ..In fact, science is studying them as treatments for addiction, because they work on a totally different brain system.

Important: I'm neither emphasizing that shrooms can be taken lightly nor it should be taken as an experiment. I'm just saying not every illegal thing is harmful to you or fellow humans. Government or authority doesn't give two flying fucks about you and your health. Shit like tobacco and alcohol are legal but science backed psilocybin (magic mushrooms are illegal). Quite a funny world we live in. If you don't trust me- search about it a bit and see any comment section of magic mushrooms video in YouTube for real nd honest opinions and how it changed their life downside up.
