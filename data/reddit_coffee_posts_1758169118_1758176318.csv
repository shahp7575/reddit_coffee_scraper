**Here u go** [**https://writers.jobsbap.com/the-marriage-1/**](https://writers.jobsbap.com/the-marriage-1/) 

In the third year of her marriage to Reid Merrow, their marriage certificate was accidentally ruined by a spilled cup of coffee. 

Taking the soggy document, Maxine Valemont went to City Hall for a replacement. The clerk spent a long time on the computer before looking up sharply. “Ma’am, our system says you’re single.” 

Maxine froze, thinking she must have misheard. “That’s impossible. My husband and I got our certifi- cate right here three years ago.” 

The clerk checked again, looking hesitant. “The system does say you’re single, but Mr. Merrow is regis- tered as married…” 

She paused. “His spouse is listed as Kelsey Sutter. Do you know her?” 

All at once, Maxine’s mind exploded. And her ears started ringing. 

Everyone knew Maxine and Reid had grown up together. 

She was his first love, the one he guarded with quiet devotion and a tender heart. 

And Kelsey was the stand-in he’d found during the two years Maxine was overseas. He had done that because he missed Maxine too much. 

\*\*\* 

Clutching the coffee-stained, ruined marriage certificate, Maxine drifted home in a daze. 

The phone rang twice, and then Reid’s voice rang out. 

“Babe, I turned down a lucrative deal just so I could be home early. I bought your favorite roses and a strawberry cake. I miss you so much. Do you miss me?” 

She suddenly laughed. 

Then tears streamed down her cheeks. 

For the past three years, he’d asked her that question every day, always telling her how much he loved 

her. 

But he’d already married someone else behind her back.

Sweet memories came flooding back. When they were kids, to fetch her kite, Reid had climbed a very high tree, fallen, and broken his right arm. But as he handed her the kite, he smiled, “Don’t cry, Max. It doesn’t hurt.” 

On her 15th birthday, he stood in the rain outside her building all night, just so he could be the first to wish her happy birthday when she woke up. 

On her 18th birthday, he booked the entire Plaza Hotel, knelt beneath the dazzling fireworks, and said, “Max, marry me when I turn twenty-two, okay?” 

Just before she left for college overseas, he pressed her against the wall, eyes red, voice trembling. “Two years. You only have two years. When time’s up, I’ll come and drag you home.” 

During those two years, he called her almost every day. ",1,1758175867.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Atlanta Falcons vs. Carolina Panthers: A Tale of Two (Injured) Birds**

The Atlanta Falcons (-5.5) and Carolina Panthers square off in a Week 3 clash that’s less “primetime” and more “prime time to nap,” given both teams’ recent struggles. Let’s unpack this like a particularly dramatic Netflix sports docuseries.

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class We Didn’t Sign Up For**  
The Falcons are favored at decimal odds of \~1.4 (implied probability: \~71%), while the Panthers hover around 3.0 (33%). That’s the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Hey, Atlanta’s got a better chance to win than you passing a lie detector test after spilling coffee on your notes.” The spread is -5.5 for Atlanta, meaning they’re expected to win by almost a touchdown. The total is 43.5 points, so if you’re betting Over/Under, imagine a game where either (a) both teams play like they’re in a video game on “Mega Chaos Mode” or (b) someone’s offense gets stuck on neutral.

**Injury Report: A Shakespearean Tragedy**  
The Falcons’ defense, which shut out the Vikings in Week 1, is dealing with corner AJ Terrell’s hamstring injury (week-to-week) and rookie edge rusher James Pearce Jr.’s groin issues. It’s like watching a symphony where the violinist has a sprained wrist and the drummer forgot their sticks. Meanwhile, the Panthers’ offensive line is a Jenga tower: guards Robert Hunt and Austin Corbett are on IR, and center Cade Mays is now manning the middle. Bryce Young, Carolina’s QB, is essentially juggling flaming chainsaws while riding a unicycle.

Historically, the Falcons own the Panthers 37-23 all-time, but the last five seasons have been a 3-2 split—a football version of a “tug-of-war” where neither side wins but everyone gets rope burns. Last year, Michael Penix Jr. torched Carolina for 312 yards, while the Panthers managed 537 total yards in the same game. That’s like a cooking show where both chefs burn the dish but somehow the judges give higher scores to the one who set the kitchen on fire *more creatively*.

• 🍜 Track everything – even the small $2 coffee adds up. Use a free app or just Google Sheets.
• 💸 The 50/30/20 rule works – 50% needs (rent, food), 30% wants (fun, social), 20% savings/debt. Adjust if you’re super broke.
• 📚 Student discounts are everywhere – Spotify, Amazon Prime, even some local restaurants. Always ask “Do you have a student discount?”
• 🛒 Meal prep saves $$$ – cooking once for 3–4 meals beats random takeout.
• 🚲 Cut transportation costs – walk, bike, or use campus shuttles instead of Uber.
• 📖 Rent/borrow textbooks – never buy new unless absolutely required. Try PDF versions if legal.
• 👯 Share costs – split streaming subscriptions, cook in groups, buy bulk groceries with roommates.
• 🎯 Set a weekly cash limit – it’s easier to control overspending if you physically limit what’s in your wallet.

 Once she walked up, put her whole arm around my shoulder while talking, and held it there for a few seconds.
Another time she leaned her side against mine while checking my work on my phone.
She also complimented by drawing calling it cute like three times and I haven't seen her get touchy with the other guys in the group (tbf there's only 5 in total out of 10) 

I can’t tell if this means she’s just comfortable around me, or if it’s something more. I don’t want to overthink, but I’m somewhat interested in her and don’t want to misread things.

What’s the best way to handle this? Should I take it as friendliness and leave it, or would it make sense to try asking her to grab coffee/food sometime to see if she’s interested?

She always tells stories of “oh this employee did blah blah blah and eeek I feel so bad I have to go confront them that we don’t do things that way!! Ugh I feel so bad I hate being the bad guy wish me luck!!!” But it would be something I did last week or something. 

Yesterday we got an email to remind us not to be on our phones… my job is SO slow. Im the only one on shift, I see my manager like once a month when she visits my location. I see maybe 10 customers in a whole 8 hour shift, so yes I’m on my phone. I put it away before the customer ever comes to the door but maybe got caught by surprise like once last week. Then later that day she told me a story of how her boss saw her employees doing stuff they’re not supposed to on a camera and when she went to walk up to talk to her own boss oh no she spilt coffee on her boss!!! And the whole story was then changed to how bad she felt for spilling coffee on her boss. As if that happened, she was just trying to tell me people watch me on the cameras I guess? 

Then like 20 minutes later she says the other manager quit, and I said oh no that’s a lot of extra work on you huh? And she said “it’s not bad except when my employees don’t do their part” and then she saw my confused face and said “oh calling in sick is inevitable I’m just talking about how I wish the ones who didn’t actually care to do their jobs right would just quit and find a job better suited for them” and I was like uhuh okay. Then wondering if she’s talking about me. 

My job is really simple but can include a lot of physical labor, and with a chronic illness I can admit I take short cuts as to not push myself into a flare. Do you think her comment was a warning that they’re thinking of firing me or was she actually talking about other people? It’s hard to read her because she talks so passive aggressively I’m always left confused about what we’re actually talking about. She’s very indirect with feedback because she always acts like she’s talking about someone else. ",1,1758174791.0,jobs,0,1.0,False

1nk05dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nk05dg/rf_maddie_maybel/,[RF] Maddie Maybel,"After work, the prickly place, and the pharmacy, I get home to my palace. Like a responsible adult I put away the groceries I’ll use tomorrow. Pancake mix and syrup in the cupboard, iced coffee and OJ in the fridge. The milk and the cocoa puffs I leave out, because as usual I’m about to watch Maddie Maybel.

Everything is perfect now in the palace except that there’s only a litre of milk. The prickly place usually has 2-litre cartons, which is what I need to finish the whole box of cocoa puffs in one night of Maddie Maybel watching. It’s a sad state of affairs really (something Jesse, Maddie’s best friend would say), but it’s okay for tonight because I have chocolate milk left over from last night, which was of course Wednesday night, the best night of the week.

Nevertheless, as I pour the 1L carton I add ‘random 2L milk shortage’ to my prick list. I started calling it the prickly place due to the cactus logo, but the name has persisted and grown in my mind with everything that seeks to prick me in there. The LED lights for example, an early entry, prick me in the eye, the iris or cornea or wherever firstly, but then it starts to itch under the pupil, and it feels like my eye is dry and chafing against the skin.

So, when it really hurts, I shut my eyes in stretches of aisles with no-one in them for a bit. But whenever I re-open them and the person halfway down is closer now, they’re always watching me. That’s Prick #2, the people. Everyone’s fine with minding their own business until other people’s business is interesting or different or inexplicable. It’s not like I was going to bump into them, after a while you get really good at judging how far you’ve gone blind. You get good enough that whenever you re-open your eyes there’s still a fair amount of distance between yourself and the next shopper, like three categories of shelf items long, enough to make you wonder why they were watching you if it wasn’t out of self-preservation.

It's not just that, that alone I could probably accept. But then there’s the snicker from the cashier, who I want to say, actually today I did say, ‘Laughter is best when shared’ to (Maddie), and the jittery leg of the man in front of you in the queue, and children running around, then stopping, then running around again. The details aren’t important anyway, just that the whole thing is a prickly ordeal and if you were me you would know that and understand.

So now at least I’m in the exotic relief of the palace and I’m darkening it. I already have noise cancelling headphones on and Maddie Maybel is ready to play, so I listen to nothing while I shut the blinds and turn all the lights off, and even though a bit of sunset still persists my DND is already on so no-one will reach me, no subscription emails or government programs or story notifications.

By 6:47 it’s me and Maddie Maybel in the living room, with my school outfit on, and until I’m about 10 episodes in I sit there watching it, pretending my Mom might come home soon and she’ll stare at the screen for half an episode and then go to her room. After, I move to my bed. There’s a brief few minutes between loungeroom TV and laptop where I walk between rooms and I’m not watching it and the palace is covered in blocky layers of darkness.

When all the cocoa puffs are done and I’m in bed, my favourite episode starts. It’s about a sunny day at the fair with face painting. Maddie and Jesse and Jade get their faces painted into animals, Maddie a lion and Jesse a monkey and Jade a zebra. And Maddie starts to chase and make faces at Jade because she’s a lion and Jade’s a zebra. So, Jade gets upset because she doesn’t understand the joke or the animal kingdom. By the end of the episode Maddie learns to not take a joke too far and Jade’s lesson is strangely omitted. They hug and Maddie says she loves Jane which is a cute image with her being a lion and Jade being a zebra. But then the episode ends, and the credits show the episode is called ‘Face Value’ which is the greatest part.

More than that though it reminds me of what my Mom told me after I came home upset on the first day of school. She said that every morning, just before the other children wake up, invisible paint is put on their faces. A colour from their parents, a colour from their favourite shows, a colour from their friends. And even though it's invisible, the child doesn’t know that and acts as if everyone could see their masked, painted face. So, when the other children upset you they’re just playing a character and think you know that. But every child also has a deep, invisible spirit in them that they don’t understand yet, and they might never understand it. This can’t touch you though because when it comes out and they make you feel it, you can just tell yourself it’s the face paint. Tell yourself it’s face paint and they can’t hurt you and they can’t prove the difference.",1,1758174260.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1nk04rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nk04rr/rf_nomansland/,[RF] No-Man’s-Land,"Part 1

&nbsp;

One morning, at his library office.

&nbsp;

The day began with a sip of iced coffee—a daily initiation he had taken up since being relocated to his current division. Monday to Friday. In summer and in winter—the cold, bitter taste serving as a cautionary reminder to adjust his modus operandi at work.

&nbsp;

He was not good with people. Never had been.

&nbsp;

He still remembered the day: his grandmother, worried about her five-year-old recluse of a grandson playing alone with a toy car all day, had dragged him out of the house and sternly ordered him to play with the neighborhood children.

&nbsp;

Even after half a century, he had to admit—with quiet resignation—that he remained fundamentally unchanged.
&nbsp;

A fish out of water.
&nbsp;

A kid out of his comfort zone.
&nbsp;

A man out of his depth.
&nbsp;

Especially when there was no official business to sustain the pretense of sociability. That was where his modus operandi came in.

&nbsp;

There was the “adjustable cognitive perimeter,” for one. Simply put, he tried to notice only those either in close proximity or with legitimate business to deal with.

&nbsp;

And then there was “needs-based sociability.” He could be talkative and forward with his closest colleagues and patrons—but not an inch beyond.

&nbsp;

Glorified rephrasings of willful myopia and cowardly façade, he thought sardonically.
&nbsp;

*Yeah, grandma would have been real proud.*

&nbsp;

He checked his schedule. No shift at the service desk today. What a relief. He could focus on his backyard work: mainly extracting data and creating metadata from an internet archive.

&nbsp;

He thought of the archive—slow, unwieldy, messy. A primordial chaos in perpetual becoming.

&nbsp;

It was not exactly a job to his taste. His brain wasn’t wired for meticulous detail work—like walking a fine line between which parts should go to the title and which to the footnotes.

&nbsp;

Despite the incessant headache, it wasn’t a completely joyless chore either.

&nbsp;

Salvaging something of value from the murky depths.
&nbsp;

Molding chaos into a tangible form.

&nbsp;


Those associations elevated him from a lowly foot soldier of the library, struggling with minute data, to a divine figure of creation myth—battling with primordial chaos for the new world order.

&nbsp;

Or rather, he mused, Vishnu churning the Sea of Milk. That fit better.

&nbsp;

OK, Lord Preserver, he told himself.
&nbsp;

*Let’s go find Amrita.*

&nbsp;

-------------------------------
Part 2

&nbsp;

His train ride home was always a time to unwind—a ritual of unwinding he meticulously upheld.

&nbsp;

Boarding the same car at the same time each evening, he always found a seat. As the slight tremor of departure rippled beneath him, he’d sink into the rhythm: phone in hand, thumb idly scrolling, the burdens of work life dissolving into blissful oblivion.

&nbsp;

Ah—the gaming channel had uploaded a new video. He noticed it at once.

&nbsp;

The game in question was one of his all-time favorites—a sprawling strategy title famous for its moddability. Dozens of DLCs to tinker with, an endless stream of user-made content, and entire worlds waiting to be twisted into new forms.

&nbsp;

He thought of the hours he’d poured into it. Over seven hundred. A number, embarrassingly, displayed on his Steam page, like a badge of obsessive honor.

&nbsp;

The game let him play however he fancied.
&nbsp;

Once, he’d been a minor warlord, locked in a bitter struggle for survival against encroaching neighbors. Another time, he’d ruled as a near-omnipotent god-king, obliterating massive hordes with a few lazy clicks of a well-placed strategic spell.

&nbsp;

It was a kind of fantasy he’d relived tens of thousands of times in his obligatory daydreaming—a habit cultivated over half a century of solitary afternoons and silent commutes.

&nbsp;

His delightful escapism was cut short when his eyes flicked to the thumbnail of another video: a lithe, middle-aged woman, carrying herself with cold, uptight grace.

&nbsp;

She reminded him of someone.

&nbsp;

For the past two years, thoughts of a certain female colleague had intruded with maddening spontaneity. And whenever they did, he found himself drifting toward a different kind of fantasy—not the kind he indulged in at his office desk or on his gaming PC.

&nbsp;

It wasn’t even sexual. He just wanted to bury his face in her bosom and have his head gently patted.
&nbsp;

*Accepted. Comforted. Warmed.*
&nbsp;

*To forget every hollow ache in her quiet embrace...*

&nbsp;

*No.*

&nbsp;

He stopped mid-fantasy, recoiling in shame and revulsion. That was going too far.

&nbsp;

He could envision himself commanding the Carthaginian host at Zama—timing a decisive elephant charge in the brief, perfect window between the center-line engagement and the return of the Numidian cavalry.
&nbsp;

He could picture himself orchestrating the Wehrmacht’s Army Groups, gutting Operation Bagration with a sweeping assault from the south, encircling Soviet armor while the center held firm.

&nbsp;

But the reverie he had of her?

&nbsp;

That was a different kind of fantasy. Too weak. Too pathetic. Too close to home—too close to the real him.
&nbsp;

And then there was the inconvenient little matter of him being married for over thirty years.

&nbsp;

Even a loser could still plumb new depths, it seemed.
&nbsp;

He inwardly chuckled and braced himself.

&nbsp;

Although he had cut the fantasy short, the damage had already been done.
Dull waves of pain began welling up from the dark recesses of his heart. That annoying, insidious sensation—it was a regular occurrence whenever his mind strayed toward her.
&nbsp;

It rarely lasted more than an hour, but it always demanded a considerable outlay of mental effort to endure.

&nbsp;

So, he initiated protocol.

&nbsp;

He detached a part of his consciousness—his self-styled HQ—and relocated it to a safe vantage point, away from the immediate emotional line of fire.
&nbsp;

From there, he could observe, analyze, and lead with cold, clinical precision. 
&nbsp;

Detached. Undisturbed.
&nbsp;

It was a tried and tested tactic, long employed to counter the demonic invasions from his inner abyss.

&nbsp;

First, he must know the enemy.

&nbsp;

The pain. 
&nbsp;

It came from the sense of loss. Or rather, incompleteness and unfulfillment that gnawed at him with every breath—a phantom throb of absence he couldn't name. Incompleteness and unfulfillment she could supposedly remedy.
&nbsp;

The phantom pain of a mutilated soul.

&nbsp;

*Oh, don’t be so dramatic.*

&nbsp;

He scoffed. As if that “completeness and fulfillment” had ever been his in the first place.

&nbsp;

Was it the Ancient Greeks, he pondered, who believed that the gods, fearing human ambition, cleaved a self-complete being in half—man and woman—condemning them forever to wander in search of their missing part?

&nbsp;

An apt parable, he thought. But not quite right.

&nbsp;

The gods, surely, had just hollowed out the human heart for efficiency. A crude shortcut for mass production. That rang truer.

&nbsp;

Thus, all humans were equally hollow inside. But some were more hollow than others, it seemed. He thought with sardonic amusement.

&nbsp;

In any case, the only phantom in this sordid mess was her―his Muse, his Aphrodite, his Athena, fused into one sublime perfection. A holy trinity of goddesses, conjured to save him from the yawning void within. His idealized womanhood made flesh.
&nbsp;

Or rather―a chimera his dopamine had seen fit to cobble together and dump into the hollow recesses of his heart.

&nbsp;

*Very helpful. Thanks a bunch.*

&nbsp;

She wasn’t real.

&nbsp;

Whatever walked past him in the office was merely the shadow cast by the abomination he’d conjured in the privacy of his endocrine feedback loop. Nature abhors a vacuum, of course, he thought wryly.

&nbsp;

He needed a name for it. A name was power. And he refused to dignify this neurochemical construct with anything remotely poetic or evocative.

&nbsp;

*An Entity.*

&nbsp;

He liked that. It had that right flavor—something pulled from a horror game. The kind that makes you hold Shift and W the second you’re spotted.

&nbsp;

As he mused and analyzed, the turmoil of battle seemed to recede—distant now, diminished. So small. So trivial. So... INCONSEQUENTIAL.

&nbsp;

Good, he thought. He was on the right track. The pain, this time, was easier to manage. If he wasn’t mistaken, the surges had been growing weaker lately. Less frequent. Less ferocious.

&nbsp;

But he curbed his optimism. He'd been here before—the dwindling flame, the illusion of closure, the false dawn of emotional distance—only for the supposed dying ember to flare back to life, all from some mundane, casual exchange with her.

&nbsp;

Better safe than sorry.

&nbsp;

Hope was a cruel baiter, dangling healing like a prize, only to drop him into the chasm of acute disappointment the moment he reached for it. He had long since learned to wear pessimism like a chitinous exoskeleton—thick, rigid, and unbecoming. It made him slower. More territorial. Less willing to risk movement.

&nbsp;

Well, he wasn't a Scorpio for nothing, he thought ruefully.

&nbsp;

Feeling the inner turmoil ebb, he sighed in relief.
&nbsp;

He hadn’t had to mobilize the reserves this time.

&nbsp;

The reserves—his last line of defense—were irregulars: undisciplined, uncontrollable, and unsavory.
&nbsp;

Bashi-bazouks he deployed with a pinched nose.

&nbsp;

Namely, his personal resentment against her.

&nbsp;

They had a history of intersectional disputes, with him more often than not on the receiving end of her roundabout sarcasm. He did not lack ammunition to fire whenever the accursed Entity stirred in the depths of his soul.

&nbsp;

He could have escalated. He chose not to.

&nbsp;

Since becoming aware of his embarrassing attachment, he’d imposed a strict regimen of avoidance—“Quarantine,” as he called it—interacting only on a need-to-communicate basis.
While he ardently craved the phantom of her in her absence, he felt only acute discomfort in her presence.
&nbsp;

Small. Exposed. Vulnerable.

&nbsp;

His gaze rolled off her like rain on a tin roof whenever it accidentally landed.
&nbsp;

His cognitive perimeter shriveled like a dried plum whenever she drew near.
&nbsp;

His attention always found a task demanding the utmost focus of a Desert Father whenever she came by his section on official business.

&nbsp;

He avoided looking directly at her, always slightly averting his gaze, even during necessary exchanges. She existed on the periphery of his vision—a ghost to be unseen, lest the slow, delayed pain creep in later like a toxin.

&nbsp;

His clumsy attempts at distancing hadn’t gone unnoticed. Her attitude, which had previously been at least amicable, had grown distinctly frigid in turn.

&nbsp;

He’d be lying if he said it didn’t pain him.
It did. A lot.

&nbsp;

It could have been his *Wunderwaffe*—low effort, self-renewing, and utterly toxic.

&nbsp;

And yet, he couldn’t bring himself to use that pain as fuel for resentment.
Maybe there was some honor left in him, he mused.

&nbsp;

She was reacting to what could only be interpreted as a rude snub. Fair enough. He even felt a pang of guilt at his own behavior.

&nbsp;

But, he reminded himself, this was asymmetrical warfare—overwhelming odds, his mental peace and autonomy at stake, dragged out for two goddamn years.
A paladin, he couldn’t afford to be.

&nbsp;

*All’s fair in love and war—*
&nbsp;

*Love, huh, very cute.*

&nbsp;

He scoffed. It was not love that he felt for her. That, he was convinced.
He was toying with the imaginary version of himself blessed with significant... validation.
&nbsp;

A trophy, perhaps.
&nbsp;

No—an ACHIEVEMENT. Like those on his Steam page.
&nbsp;

He thought of an appropriate title.

&nbsp;

No fool like an old fool—Self-validation at the cost of a coral anniversary.
&nbsp;

Global achievement stat: 0.007%

&nbsp;

There you have it. A trophy to end all trophies.

&nbsp;

Sure, everyone’s the protagonist in their own life story. Perhaps, nearing life’s endgame, there was a forgotten part of him that wanted one last shot at a tragic, epic romance.
Not as tragic, he snickered, as the guy who had come up with the bright idea to audition for this wretched farce.

&nbsp;

And the burning bridge between them in real life? Let it burn down. Let the fire spread. He would see whether the pernicious infestation could still thrive on scorched earth.

&nbsp;

A tide of anxiety began to rise—an uneasy sense that he was missing his last chance to pass through the gate of salvation. 
&nbsp;

Straight, narrow, and closing by the minute.

&nbsp;

They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth...

&nbsp;

Yeah, right. Like hell it works that way, he sneered in quiet defiance.
&nbsp;

And yet, beneath the defiance, the unease still gnawed at him.

&nbsp;

Then, without warning, a piece of music welled up from the depths of memory—Mahler’s Adagietto from the Fifth Symphony. 
&nbsp;

How very original. He thought dryly, but he didn’t stop it.

&nbsp;

The strings entrapped him, carrying him downward, the silken melody threading through his mind, softening the edges of thought—like spider silk wrapping prey before the bite. It worked—more than he cared to admit.

&nbsp;

With the music came an image:

&nbsp;

*Of slow death.*
&nbsp;

*Of moribund energy quietly yielding to entropy.*
&nbsp;

*Of a gentle, inexorable embrace into nothingness and oblivion.*

&nbsp;

He stopped thinking and let himself sink into a state of serene numbness.

&nbsp;

-------------------------------
Part 3

&nbsp;

He did not know when it all started.

&nbsp;

Was it when, seeing her first thing in the morning, he thought her outfit looked… lame?

&nbsp;

Was it when he overheard her chatting with another male colleague and felt only the faintest pinch in his chest—less a wound, more a flicker?

&nbsp;

Or was it when avoiding her no longer triggered that old, twitchy alert? When the thought of permanent alienation began to settle—not as resignation, but as the natural order of things?

&nbsp;

That was when he realized: for the first time in this two-year war, he had seized the strategic initiative.
&nbsp;

Yes—the post-Kursk Red Army kind of initiative. But still, a long, grinding crawl to Berlin. 
&nbsp;

One overreach and he would suffer a stinging backhand blow. He’d been there. Tasted that. Several times.

&nbsp;

There was an undeniable joy. And curiosity, admittedly of a slightly morbid kind.

&nbsp;

He had never been able to remember the moment of falling asleep. Would be even less likely to register the moment of his own death.
But perhaps… perhaps he could record the moment when a part of his heart dies.

&nbsp;

Thus ended the chronicle, he thought. Two years’ worth of pathetic reminiscing.

&nbsp;

He had already traced its beginning. It was his former section boss. The boss hadn’t seen her eye to eye, to put it most charitably.

&nbsp;

“I’ll let you handle the communication with her from now on,” she had said cheerfully. “Oh, don’t worry. She seems to have a soft spot for you!”

&nbsp;

That offhand remark had set in motion his old, lethargic heart… and his emotional freefall into the bottomless abyss.

&nbsp;

Couldn’t blame her, he thought wryly. She had just wanted to dump an unpleasant job onto his lap, coupled with a ridiculously implausible sweetener.
If some dumb fish had swallowed the hook, line, and sinker along with it, well—he had only himself to blame.

&nbsp;

Things went uphill quickly from there, however. Far quicker than he’d anticipated.

&nbsp;

The next day, a brief official interaction presented itself. He saw her.

&nbsp;

A woman in her mid-fifties. Tall. Lithe. Graceful. Flowing clothes. Short, expertly trimmed hair. A sullen expression verging on a scowl. The voice—still low-pitched, still grating.

&nbsp;

Same as ever.

&nbsp;

But the witchfire that had roasted him from within—
&nbsp;

Quenched.

&nbsp;

The enthrallment that had seized his mind, hijacking his imagination and making a mockery of reason—
&nbsp;

Broken.

&nbsp;

The Entity that had ensnared his heart in its spectral grasp, bending his pulse to cold, capricious tyranny—
&nbsp;

Exorcised.

&nbsp;

It took hours to trust the feeling. He’d learned not to hope—hope was a poisoned chalice. But this time, even his thick carapace couldn’t prevent it from seeping in.

&nbsp;

He was free.

&nbsp;

Two years. Tooth and nail. Dirty, asymmetrical warfare.
&nbsp;

And now: silence.

&nbsp;

He stood alone on the scorched ground, blackened by the fire that had once raged within.
&nbsp;

But solitude? Hollowness?
&nbsp;

They were old friends.

&nbsp;

The fire hadn’t created the wasteland. It had only concealed it.

&nbsp;

And now, standing in that bleak, familiar quiet, he found what he'd truly been after:

&nbsp;

*Clarity.*

&nbsp;

*Serenity.*

&nbsp;

*Finality.*

&nbsp;

No fanfare. No parade. Just the clean air of a battlefield finally still.

I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

I'm based in India, in a Tier 1 city, where sugaring is a niche lifestyle limited mostly to the major cities. But one thing I've discovered over the last year is that almost no woman I've met is exclusive, while many pretend they are. My allowance - PPM is on the higher side - as I've discovered through online forums and connecting with others in this lifestyle.

While I understand this lifestyle is basically make believe and based on mutual benefits, I'm a bit old fashioned. I’d be lying if I said the thought didn’t cross my mind, when I’m intimate with someone, that she might have been with someone else just yesterday. Beyond the risk of STIs, it also feels quite shallow, basically like escorting.

I wanted to understand how this works in other countries. I realize this varies person to person - but is it the norm for women to see multiple ""SD""s? In India, very few women are even down for an unpaid coffee meet, which makes this entire thing feel super transactional (which I understand it is).

# ✨ What Are Roof Lanterns?

A roof lantern is a glass structure mounted on a flat or pitched roof. It acts like a raised skylight, often with multiple glass panes and frames, designed to channel natural daylight into the room below. 🌤️

# 🔧 Installation Considerations

Before installing a roof lantern, it’s important to keep certain factors in mind:

1. Roof Structure 🏗️ – Ensure your roof is structurally capable of supporting the lantern.
2. Glazing Options 🪟 – Choose from double or triple glazing for improved insulation.
3. Ventilation 🌬️ – Some roof lanterns can be designed with opening vents to help regulate airflow.
4. Orientation 🧭 – Positioning the lantern towards the sun’s path maximizes daylight intake.

1njzoio,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamifiedlifeos/comments/1njzoio/the_origin_story_of_gamified_life_os/,The Origin Story of Gamified Life OS,"# The Inspiration

Hey there, Gamer!

Gamified Life OS is not just a Notion template. It's a tangible way to improve your life. It is a philosophy turned actionable. I don't think many people know this, but the whole basis of Gamified Life OS actually came from a cartoon show (one of the best, in my opinion).

It was inspired by Avatar: The Last Airbender. Its beautiful story, captivating characters, and riveting themes that reflect real-life struggles.

But most of all, I was inspired by a drawing of the 4 elements by Uncle Iroh when he was teaching Zuko about drawing wisdom from different places.

Instead of drawing wisdom from fire or water alone, Uncle Iroh taught Zuko to learn from all the other elements.

[The 4 elements as explained by Uncle Iroh](https://preview.redd.it/kgkln5aamupf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee464cabf3891b6a037b8e3e913e2c46a7904c55)

>*""It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If we take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale."" - Uncle Iroh*

Something really resonated with me about what Uncle Iroh said. There is something powerful and life-changing about getting knowledge and inspiration from the world around you and using it to grow and be better.

This got me thinking.

We obviously can't bend elements, but we certainly can improve every *aspect* of our lives. What if instead of *fire*, we bent our *bodies* to be as strong as can be? What if instead of *water*, we bent our minds to be smarter and wiser?

From the beginning, I was already thinking of how the teachings in *Avatar: The Last Airbender* could translate into something actionable in real life.

# From Sketch to System, Ascend OS

I didn't have a concrete idea in mind yet, but by October of 2023, I drew up sketches and planned out something I called ""Ascend OS""

It was designed with the core philosophy of ""ascending"" in life. Ergo, to become better, to become something greater. To reach a great point.

[Ascend OS \(Excuse the poor handwriting, haha!\)](https://preview.redd.it/1pbkvnx4pupf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a30f442ab2c474877732e8f0c4c0e55e3dd62e12)

Technically speaking, I designed it as a sort of Second Brain Notion template, using a modified ""PARA"" framework by Tiago Forte.

I didn't really have much gamification in mind until later on, when I realized that Ascend OS would work better as a gamified system.

I got back to work and implemented the idea in Notion, and the outcome was a very simple gamification-style template that could allow you to earn EXP from habits, journaling, reading, cooking, and completing goals.

Have a look at the screenshot below: as you can see, Ascend OS was very simple and *Avatar: The Last Airbender* themed. Gamers would earn EXP directly, and can manage ""Aspects"" which are essentially Life Areas.

[An early version of Ascend OS \(now Gamified Life OS\)](https://preview.redd.it/vhl3rwhxpupf1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=920b031943db94274503e0eb059f7ae44a5004ff)

I was very proud of the 1st prototype. It worked and I enjoyed using it.

Unfortunately, it just wasn't quite yet. I felt like taking inspiration from *Avatar: The Last Airbender* was fine, but using actual images from the show? Perhaps not the route.

Instead, I opted to imitate the vibes of the show: ancient-oriental, with a dash of wisdom and care. I wanted to feel like I entered a dojo when I opened the template.

I renamed it from ""Ascend OS"" to ""Gamified Life OS"" as I wanted something original and could stand on its own. (On second thought, Ascend OS kinda sounds too edgy!)

What if I wanted a minimalist theme, an ""Avatar"" theme, and a cyberpunk theme? I thought it would be a cool idea to have multiple themes.

Once I was confident with my work, I decided to share it on Reddit just for fun. I saw people flexing their dashboards, so I   flexed mine as well!

Surprisingly, it gained significant traction and lots of views. People genuinely liked it and the *Avatar: The Last Airbender* vibes.

I was ecstatic as well, learning that people would pay for such a thing, so I thought, ""*Hey, why not use this as a way to earn a little extra on the side?*""

And so I created the first official version of Gamified Life OS (for people to use).

Thinking about it makes me feel so nostalgic. I named the ""main"" theme ""Balance"" (you can probably guess why by now).

[Gamified Life OS 1.0](https://preview.redd.it/q9kyp4zyrupf1.jpg?width=1005&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0afb836f8e1a0910ecb5def9b31c426cff558f45)

Things were great: for some reason, and I honestly didn't really understand it at the time, **people LOVED Gamified Life OS**.

There was a love and appreciation for it, and I even got a few compliments saying they could tell it was made with love (it was!)

# Gamified Life OS to Stardom

Shortly after, perhaps around December, Gamified Life OS became an official featured template, handpicked by the Notion team themselves.

I was ECSTATIC! I didn't even know until someone on Twitter told me about it. My brain child of a Notion template inspired by *Avatar: The Last Airbender,* handpicked by Notion themselves?

No way.

Even now, despite ""Gamified Life OS"" not being the only one of its name (ugh, unoriginal copycats!) It is the only one that's been featured by Notion themselves. What an achievement!

Shortly after, I even became an official recommended Notion creator. I am forever grateful!

# The Road to Gamified Life OS 2.0

As successful as Gamified Life OS was, I just knew that it could be so much better. It had so much potential to not just be a simple gamification template, but a legit, staple tool that people could rely on for their daily lives.

Not to sound ""woo-woo,"" but I really wanted people to feel like they bought the key to their productivity problems.

I got to work on Gamified Life OS 2.0.

I planned for it to be bigger, better, and the best out there. I worked on some highly requested features, added beautiful themes (minimalist, fantasy, ghibli, and cyberpunk), made the dashboard something that feels like home when you log on, and perhaps the best part: a way to earn REAL rewards with your EXP. The only gamified Notion template offering such a feature.

It took almost 7 months of hard work to create a truly productive system without getting gimmicky (I hate cluttered dashboards with useless widgets!) And out came Gamified Life OS 2.0:

[Gamified Life OS 2.0 \(Ghibli theme\)](https://preview.redd.it/out87upkuupf1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=13a9d759b026f6ac011d1f63c62f3d22a3928d44)

It still maintained the philosophy of *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, focusing on improving aspects of your life holistically and with intention.

I made sure that everyone who used it would feel like it was an extension of themselves, instead of a cluttered, maintenance-heavy chore.

# From Stardom to New Heights

The release of Gamified Life OS 2.0 gave me so much anxiety that I had to cut down on coffee for a bit. 7 months of work, and I didn't know if people would actually like it.

Turns out, **everyone did!**

Gamified Life OS 2.0 (Now just Gamified Life OS) really gained huge traction everywhere. It got x10 more users, it [went viral on TikTok, gaining +100k views](https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSDDhgWsS/), left and right, people genuinely loved and resonated with a simple system that works. It even got its own website: [GamifiedLifeOS.com](http://GamifiedLifeOS.com)

I didn't design it to be the ""most advanced"" or ""coolest"" Notion template.

I designed it to be philosophy-first. Function-first. To serve people instead of being served by people.

Again, not to sound woo-woo, but I can't stand pretending an overcomplicated mess is actually useful.

And that’s the story of how Gamified Life OS came to be. From a sand drawing by Uncle Iroh, to a system thousands of people use to level up their lives every day.

Share your setups, your tweaks, your triumphs. Ask questions. Be inspired. And maybe, just maybe, discover a little wisdom from all the elements of life around you, like I did.

Here’s to bending your life toward balance, growth, and adventure.

I am happy to say that I have had the pleasure of enjoying an affogato every night for the past week thanks to the decision to buy a bag of decaf beans. The beans I chose are close to what I drink daily, lighter roast with a fruit forward profile.

1njzhw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1njzhw5/graveyard_shift_at_the_graveyard_chapter_1/,Graveyard Shift at the Graveyard (Chapter 1: Introduction),"I work the graveyard shift at a graveyard. Yeah. Real original. I get that a lot. Most people think it’s a joke when I tell them, like I’m setting up a bad pun or trying to be edgy, but it’s a real job. I clock in at midnight, clock out at six. In between, I make sure nothing kills bystanders, catches fire, or tries to unionize.

It’s not your average cemetery gig, either. You won’t find any freshly cut grass or mournful violins out here. Well, unless you count the Russian phantoms that show up every other Thursday to perform interpretive ballet to Tchaikovsky. They don’t talk, they don’t blink, and one of them definitely levitates. It’s honestly kind of beautiful, if you can get past the part where they’re the ghosts of  fifty-year old men wearing tutus over three-piece suits.

There are no rows of polished marble headstones, either. No cherubs or pristine mausoleums. Just a bunch of half-sunken markers, names long worn away by time and weather, leaning like they’re trying to get away from something underground. The grass is patchy at best, the moss sings in Latin sometimes, and there’s a red, cranky, bottomless lake at the edge of the property that sometimes tells me to kill myself when I pass by it.

Oh, and there’s a fruit. An actual fruit. It looks like a mango, but insists it’s Ares, the Greek god of war. That’s its own story. All I’ll say for now is that he’s pretty chill. 

Strange things happen here. A lot of strange things. Sometimes the graves whisper. Sometimes they scream. Sometimes they ask for coffee and a bottle of Jack Daniels.

I know that it sounds like I’m making it up. Believe me, I wish I was. But if you’re listening to this, maybe you already know better. Maybe you’ve heard the rumors. The stories. The late-night AM radio callers who talk about “the one graveyard out past the lake, where the dead don’t stay politely buried.” Maybe you've even heard about the incident with the ghost of an Elvis impersonator. Yeah, *that* one.

He escaped from Plot 27 during a full moon, still wearing the rhinestone jumpsuit he was buried in. He had a cape, sideburns, the whole shebang. Except now, he was glowing faintly and had no lower jaw, but that didn’t stop him from trying to sing “The Wonder of You” at full volume.

He floated straight into the town’s local chapel, moaning like a lovesick banshee and wielding a spoon like it was Excalibur. Somehow — and I still don’t know how — he got tangled in a ceiling fan, rewired the sound system to play only his demo tapes, and summoned a rain of glitter every time someone said “hallelujah.” The can of WD-40? Don’t ask. All I’ll say is that the organist still twitches whenever he smells it.

I had to work double shifts that week. First to clean up the ectoplasmic rhinestones, then to fix the roof, then to memory-wipe the congregation. I don't know how, but Reverend Tim still calls me “Mr. Vegas” whenever I pass by.

Regardless, this is where it started. My first night. The night I should’ve turned around and walked straight back to town. But I didn’t. I went through the gate, found the shack, read the note... and I took the job anyway.

Because I’m an idiot. Or maybe just too broke. Probably both.

I found the job listing taped to a telephone pole between a missing cat flyer and an ad for discount dental work. Big, blocky letters read:  
*“NOW HIRING — GROUNDSKEEPER (GRAVEYARD SHIFT). NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY. APPLY IN PERSON.”*

There was no phone number or company name. Just an address scrawled at the bottom in thick black marker that had bled through the paper.

I don’t know what made me drive ten miles to the edge of town to check it out. Boredom, mostly. A desire to not starve, maybe. Curiosity, definitely. When you're jobless, out of Red Bull and hookah tobacco, and three days past the grace period on your rent, you start making decisions based more on vibes than logic.

The graveyard sat at the end of a long dirt road, tucked between a rotting tree line and a lake with water colored like blood. A rusted iron gate creaked open as I approached, because of course it did, and a wooden sign above it read simply:*“Restfield Memorial Park. Established Never.”*

I almost turned around then. But then again, no tobacco, no money. Basically, I had no other options.

The groundskeeper’s cabin was about the size of…well, a cabin, with one flickering porch light and a crooked “office” sign dangling from a rusty nail. I knocked once. The door swung open before my hand even fell back to my side.

The shack wasn’t locked. I took that as an invitation.

The smell hit me first — a humid slap of old paper, damp wood, mildew, and something faintly sweet. Like someone had spilled peach soda decades ago and decided it was easier to build the flooring around it than clean it up.

Inside, it looked like every run-down office I’d ever worked in, except maybe a little worse. The lighting was fluorescent and harsh, but only half-functional; one tube blinked like it was sending distress signals in Morse code. The desk was a hulking metal relic, covered in coffee stains, deep scratches, and what I sincerely hoped was candle wax. Three dented filing cabinets sat crookedly along the far wall, one drawer permanently stuck halfway open like it was gasping for air.

A coat rack stood in the corner holding exactly one item: a moldy trench coat that smelled like wet dog. Next to it was a cracked bulletin board covered in yellowed memos with titles like *“DO NOT FEED THE WEREGATORS”* and *“WHOEVER STOLE THE ZOMBIES SMELLING SALTS: BRING IT BACK.”*

A tiny window above the desk was fogged over from the inside, framing a perfect view of absolutely nothing. And then there was the coffee maker. An ancient, stained contraption sitting on a dusty side table, looking more like a museum artifact than an appliance. It made a low mechanical groan every few seconds, as if it was angry no one had sacrificed beans to it lately.

No sign of a person. No welcome. No “thanks for coming all the way out to the middle of nowhere, please ignore the death fog.”

Just a single folded piece of paper sitting in the middle of the desk, perfectly centered, with my name written on the front in shaky black ink:

*Henry.*

No one knew I was coming, but I opened the note.

“Henry, you're hired.

$19.87/hour. Midnight to 6 a.m., seven days a week. Payday is every other Friday, cash only. For now, you are the sole night-shift employee. Hand over the key to the day-shift crew when morning comes. There is no HR. There are no benefits. Consider that a benefit.

A few suggestions: 

Don't open the fridge. Don't talk to the man in the mirror (he isn't you). If the lake hisses, feed it fruit roll-ups (found in the topmost office desk drawer). Jade will probably show up, let her talk. It’s easier that way. You can, and should, fistfight the vampire in the woods. Death likes Lipton tea specifically (found by the fruit roll-ups). You are allowed one (1) mental breakdown per quarter. Please schedule accordingly. Grave #10 is off-limits. If it’s open, evacuate immediately.

Welcome aboard.”

— Management

There was no pen. No contract to sign. Just a key taped to the bottom of the note labeled *“Groundkeeper.”*

I stood there for a long minute, holding the paper.

Then the fridge behind me *clicked* like it had just kicked on. I didn’t turn around.

Instead, I sat down, and leaned back in the cracked vinyl chair behind the desk.

“I need a drink.”

1njzdfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/loanoriginators/comments/1njzdfd/what_would_you_do/,What would you do?,"Hey everyone, looking for some outside perspective on a little situation I got going on. 

Been an originator for a few years now and I do pretty well for myself. A few years back when I was first starting I linked up with a top producing realtor and have been one of her two go-to lenders ever since. Over the last few years we have also grown a friendship which is nice because we’re both very like-minded and driven ladies and we have always had a really well-set boundary between friendship and business, never any drama and we know when it’s time to put friendship aside and get to work. We’ve handled some really hard transactions together and I truly do believe had we never linked up to work together we’d still be just as close friendship wise. 

About 9 months ago she asked me to do her a solid and sit down with another life long friend of hers who was thinking of getting started as an LO… just got licensed and was looking for advice and a possible job opportunity. After meeting with her I saw a lot of potential.. she connected with others well, had a good social media presence, and could finesse any conversation. However, I had my reservations about bringing her onto my team as an originator and told her I think she’d really benefit from a year or two as an LOA. I firmly believe that the key to being a great LO is to learn HOW to structure a deal and then learn how to sell it. She seemed to be on board so all that was left was to bring her resume to my team manager and let her interview. Well, either this friend completely misunderstood what I meant by LOA or she completely ignored my advice because my team manager left that interview convinced she wasn’t the right fit for us (she was right). I let it go, didn’t pressure either side, and ultimately this new LO/friend ended up taking a job at some other company 2 months later as a Jr LO of some sorts.

Unsurprisingly, she didn’t thrive. She had no idea what she was doing, was not give proper training or support, and wanted to quit 30 days in. I encouraged her to stay the course and learn as much as she could.. watch YT videos breaking down income and guidelines, dive into AllRegs, try to make friends with other top producers and ask if she could shadow.. idk she just didn’t seem motivated or something even with me constantly helping her figure out tricky applications or work through issues she was having. In an ironic twist of fate kind of way, another team at my current company recently found her and recruited her and she now seemingly has all the support and resources to get some business going. Great, super happy for her. Except now that she’s on this new team with everything she needs to finally get going, she has blatantly started poaching business from our mutual realtor friend who initially introduced us knowing full well the time and care I have invested into that referral partnership. Not only that, but this mutual realtor friend who made the initial introduction runs a very successful team of realtors, all of whom I do business with regularly, and this new LO is now poaching THEIR business too. I’m very unsettled by this, and honestly a little hurt that I went out on a limb for this girl and this is the thanks I get. There’s plenty of business to be had, and plenty of agents to try and work with.. but she has to go to the ones she knows that I’ve built a very long standing relationship with? She always seemed so grateful that I would take time to answer her questions or give advice about what her next career move should be. I’m feeling very much like I am being stabbed in the back. I don’t even know how to approach the situation. Do I say something to her? Do I say something to the mutual realtor friend? Or do I let it go and try to go find another top producing agent to supplement the business I am potentially losing? The realtor friend still sends me business. But in the weeks that have passed since LO friend started actively soliciting her I have noticed a sharp decline in both leads and communication. I try to stay top of mind, offering rate flyers for OH, going to closings, trying to set up coffees or lunches..

I know this is all petty and I should probably pull up my bootstraps and move on but I like to think I’m a pretty genuine gal and idk this stings a bit. What would you do?",2,1758171536.0,loanoriginators,3,1.0,False

1njzayd,https://i.redd.it/n2vra47ytupf1.jpeg,A marriage made of lies free link please!!,"After pretending to be her sister and married with Cadoc for three years, Emma Jefferson can finally leave him now.
""Your sister will be back in a month. Until then, you have to keep pretending to be her,"" her mother, Zoey Jefferson, said coldly over the phone. ""Once that's done, I'll transfer five million to you. Then you're free to do whatever you want.""
""Okay,"" Emma replied softly, her voice calm.
After she hung up, she stared at the giant wedding photo on the wall.
Cadoc looked handsome in his suit, and she was in a stunning gown, smiling softly.
""It's been three years,"" she whispered, brushing her finger across the photo frame. ""It's finally over.""
Three years ago, the marriage between the Fitzgerald and the Jefferson families made headlines. Her twin sister, Ella Jefferson, had been chosen as the Fitzgerald family's future daughter-in-law.
But on the eve of the wedding, she left a note and vanished.
""Dad, Mom, I don't want to be tied down by marriage, but I know it's my duty. Just give me three years to live freely. I'll come back after that.""
To keep the deal between the two families alive, Zoey and her husband, Dylan Jefferson, had no choice but to bring Emma back—the twin daughter they'd left behind in the countryside since she was a kid.
Emma had never even been allowed at family events, but she became a substitute bride under Ella's name.
""Cadoc doesn't like your sister,"" Zoey said coldly the night before the wedding. ""He's hung up on a poor scholarship girl. Marrying him won't be easy, but just stay in line and get through these three years pretending to be Ella.""
Emma had only nodded back then.
Of course, she knew who Cadoc was. His face was always in finance magazines. He was the most prestigious nobleman among the elites, with socialites practically throwing themselves at him.
She had also heard the story about Sophie.
Sophie was a struggling student sponsored by the Fitzgerald family. She attended a top university on scholarship. Cadoc loved her deeply and wanted to be with her, even against his family's wishes. But Sophie, proud and distant, couldn't accept a relationship without anyone's approval, so she chose to end things and go overseas.
The Fitzgerald family was overjoyed and rushed to arrange Cadoc's marriage.
Married life turned out to be way harder than Emma thought.
Cadoc's study was covered in photos of Sophie. He flew to Paris every week just to see her secretly. Meanwhile, Emma wasn't even allowed to enter the main bedroom. She had to sleep in the guest room at the far end of the hallway.
She was cautious and tried her best to act like Ella. To make sure the partnership between their families' companies wouldn't fall apart, she did everything she could to stay on Cadoc's good side.
If he worked late, she'd leave the lights on and wait by the door. When his stomach acted up, she'd wake up at five every morning to make oatmeal. He liked a quiet house, so she stayed as silent as possible.
Eventually, people started saying she was crazy in love with him. But slowly, the way he looked at her began to shift.
The photos of Sophie vanished from his study. His Paris trips stopped. He started remembering Emma's birthday, came home early when she was sick, and even began sleeping with her.
Emma almost believed that genuine love had somehow come from that substitute marriage.
Then, three months ago, Sophie returned.
Everything flipped back.
Cadoc's attention was on Sophie again. He stopped coming home, and Sophie's photos were back in his study. People mocked Emma like she was some kind of joke. But she never made a scene. She just smiled.
The truth was—she never loved him.
She only stayed for the money and freedom her parents promised. If Cadoc had fallen for her, great. If not, she wouldn't care.
Nobody knew that Emma and Ella might have shared a face, but their lives were nothing alike.
Zoey nearly died giving birth to Emma. Since then, she looked at Emma with nothing but disgust. Dylan doted on Zoey so much that he treated Emma like a jinx.
At age five, Emma was shipped off to live with a nanny in the countryside.
She still remembered that one freezing winter. The heater broke, and she was shaking in the cold without even a proper coat. Meanwhile, Ella was snug in a fancy villa, wrapped in designer clothes, being showered in love.
After 18 years of being treated like she didn't matter, Emma had stopped expecting family affection.
With just a month left, she'd finally get the five million promised for pretending to be Ella. Then, she could leave this place and live life on her terms.
While she was in a good mood, her phone buzzed with a call.
It was Cadoc.
Emma took a breath and picked up. ""Hello?""
He hung up before she could respond. Emma stared at the phone, already knowing who they were for.
He said coldly, ""Bring sanitary pads to the Nightfall Club. Night ones. You've got 20 minutes.""
Outside, the rain was pouring. The drive from the Fitzgerald's villa to the Nightfall Club usually took at least 40 minutes.
Still, Emma grabbed an umbrella and left.
Traffic was awful. With just 12 minutes left, she checked the time, gritted her teeth, and jumped out of the car, running through the rain.
The rain quickly drenched her clothes, and her high heels kept slipping on the slick pavement. She lost her balance and crashed into a puddle, pain searing through her knees.
But she kept going. She finally made it to the club at the 19th minute.
Before knocking on the private room's door, she overheard people laughing inside.
""Mr. Fitzgerald, are you truly asking Ella to come out in this storm just to drop off pads? It'll take at least 40 minutes from your place.""
""Sophie is hurting,"" Cadoc replied indifferently, ""Ella will figure it out.""
""Well, that's right. Everyone knows how deeply Ella loves you. For the past three years, even though your heart belonged to someone else, she's stayed by your side without a single complaint.""
Someone teased, ""Come on, man. Are you sure you weren't tempted by that beauty who's been by your side all these years?""
There was silence. Emma held her breath.
After a pause, Cadoc said, ""Between Sophie and Ella, I'll always choose Sophie.""
His words didn't hurt. Instead, she felt relieved. She waited until the laughter stopped, then knocked on the door.
When she walked in, everyone looked stunned.
""Wow, right on time!""
""Ella, why are you drenched?""
Cadoc got up, frowning. ""Why are you in a mess?""
Emma handed over the well-protected pads. ""You said 20 minutes. I didn't want you to worry, so I ran the rest of the way.""
She didn't bring up the fall or the pain.
Cadoc's expression shifted slightly. He took off his suit jacket and draped it over her shoulders. ""Wear this.""
Then, he motioned toward the pads. ""Take those to the ladies' room.""
Emma nodded and walked off.
At the restroom, she knocked. A soft voice answered, ""Who is it?""
""I brought the pads.""
There was silence for a few seconds, then the door opened slightly. Emma handed them over without a word and left.
Back home, she took a hot bath. Her scraped knee stung.
Lying in bed, she finally felt at peace. Freedom was so close she could taste it.
But before she could sleep, the door burst open.
Cadoc stormed in, grabbed her wrist. ""Get up!""
Before Emma could react, he yanked her out of bed and dragged her toward the stairs.
""Cadoc? What are you—""
Before she could finish speaking, he shoved her hard, knocking her backward. The back of her head struck the step hard as she tumbled down the stairs.
Severe pain exploded through her whole body.
Lying at the bottom, she struggled to move. Her vision was fuzzy, blood trickling down her face.
""Why... Why are you doing this?!""
Cadoc stood above her, his face shadowed. His voice was chillingly cold.
""Did you push Sophie?""
Emma stared up, confused. ""What?""
""Drop the act!"" He stepped closer. ""You've been acting all generous just waiting for a chance, right? You shoved her out the window. She's broken all over and almost died!""
""I didn't..."" She shook her head weakly. The movement aggravated the wound on her head, making her feel lightheaded and dizzy.
Cadoc squatted down, grabbing her chin. ""Ella, have you started thinking I care about you? We're only married, not in love.""
He leaned in and emphasized, ""I'll never love you!""
Emma felt pain all over. But instead of crying, she almost laughed.
She never wanted his love in the first place.

Chapter 2
Emma was about to say something, but Cadoc yanked her up coldly.
""Cut the act,"" he said coldly. ""Sophie fell from the fifth floor. You only tumbled down from the second.
""Get up. We're going to the hospital—you're going to apologize.""
He dragged her out like he didn't even notice the blood still dripping from her forehead or how her injured knee was bleeding again. Every step she took felt like she was walking on knives.
He shoved her into the car, and neither of them said a word the entire ride.
Emma stared blankly out the window, watching the scenery go by. She told herself to hold on a little longer. Freedom was almost here.
At the hospital, Sophie sat propped up in bed, looking pale, her wrists covered in bandages.
The second she spotted Emma, she shrank back. Her eyes filled with tears.
""Cadoc..."" she whimpered, voice shaking. ""I-I don't want to see her...""
Cadoc rushed to her side, took her hand, and said softly, ""Don't worry. I'm here. No one is going to hurt you.""
Then, he turned to Emma, his expression hard. ""Why are you just standing there? Apologize.""
Emma looked exhausted, but her voice was calm.
She stared at Sophie and asked softly, ""Ms. Powell, are you truly saying I pushed you off that window?""
Sophie's lashes fluttered. Her eyes filled with tears again. ""Ms. Jefferson, if you're not willing to apologize, it's fine. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.""
She sniffled and looked pitiful. ""Cadoc has been staying by my side lately. I get why you hate me. But your marriage wasn't about love. If I came from the right kind of family, you wouldn't even be in the picture...""
Her crying got worse, and Cadoc's face got darker.
He interrupted sharply, ""Ella! I told you to apologize, not pick a fight! Are you gonna do it or not?""
Emma closed her eyes for a second. She knew Sophie was framing her, but she was leaving soon.
She couldn't afford any issues in the partnership between the two families. Otherwise, she'd lose the five million and her chance at freedom.
So, she just said, ""I'm sorry. I was wrong.""
Then, she turned to leave.
But Cadoc stopped her. ""Wait. Since you pushed her, you should stay and take care of her until she's out of the hospital.""
Emma's fingers twitched slightly, but she nodded. ""Alright.""
In the following days, Emma stayed quietly in Sophie's ward.
Cadoc practically moved into the hospital, ignoring work and feeding Sophie oatmeal, helping her wash up, and coaxing her to sleep.
He never did those for Emma.
But she never looked upset. She just took care of Sophie calmly, like it was just another chore.
The nurses whispered about it behind her back.
""Wow, I've never seen a wife this generous!""
""You don't get it. This is love at its most selfless."" Another nurse sighed. ""She's so in love with Mr. Fitzgerald that she's even willing to care for the woman he loves—just to get a little more of his attention. How pitiful.""
Cadoc happened to walk by and overheard.
He stopped in his tracks and glanced toward the ward.
Emma sat with her head down, carefully peeling an apple. Her profile looked calm and tender.
A strange feeling suddenly stirred in Cadoc's heart.
When the day finally came for Sophie to leave the hospital, Cadoc told Emma straight up, ""I'm taking Sophie on a trip. Don't contact me unless it's urgent.""
Emma nodded. ""Got it.""
She watched them walk away hand in hand and felt lighter.
Finally, she didn't have to deal with them anymore.
As soon as she got home, she began packing her luggage, getting ready to leave soon.
A few days later, she came across Sophie's latest Instagram post.
Cadoc had taken her to the Maldives. He'd made an unlimited bid for her at an auction and spent a fortune on her favorite jewelry.
Emma looked at it for a second, then just scrolled past.
She didn't care.
She never did.

Chapter 3
A week later, it was time for the Fitzgerald family's regular monthly dinner.
Since Cadoc wasn't around, Emma had to show up on her own.
When Cadoc's mother, Amanda Fitzgerald, saw Emma walk in, her expression darkened. ""Where's Cadoc?""
Emma kept her head down. ""He's busy with something. He couldn't make it back.""
Amanda sneered and was about to respond when the butler rushed over and handed her an entertainment newspaper.
The headline was a photo of Cadoc and Sophie kissing on a yacht.
Amanda slammed her fork down. ""Ella! Come with me now!""
She stormed off to the study. As soon as the door shut, she yelled, ""Get on your knees!""
Without saying a word, Emma dropped to her knees.
""You trash!"" Amanda was shaking with rage. ""You can't even keep your husband! You've got two choices—call him home now or take your punishment!""
Emma's lashes fluttered.
She knew that no matter how many times she called, Cadoc wouldn't show up.
He was probably wrapped up in a cozy getaway with Sophie. If she bothered him, the deal between their families could fall apart.
""I'll take the punishment,"" she said softly.
Amanda was pis-sed off. ""What did you just say?""
""I choose the punishment."" Emma raised her head calmly. ""Go ahead.""
Flushed with anger, Amanda grabbed the whip hanging on the wall and hit it hard on Emma's back.
""Still not calling him?""
Slap!
""How about now?!""
Slap!
Emma bit her lips tightly, pain searing through her body, but she only shook her head.
Eventually, she passed out.
When she woke up, she was lying in a hospital bed, her back wrapped in thick bandages.
Cadoc was sitting nearby, looking annoyed.
""My mom was giving you a hard time. Why didn't you just call me?"" he asked coldly.
Emma gave him a weak smile. ""I didn't want to ruin your date with Ms. Powell.""
He froze.
Her pale face reminded him of something the nurse had said.
""She's so in love with Mr. Fitzgerald that she's even willing to care for the woman he loves...""
Did she love him so deeply that she'd rather face punishment than bother him?
Cadoc felt an even deeper sense of unease growing in his heart.
For the next few days, he stayed at the hospital to look after her for the first time.
Emma didn't need his help, but he didn't leave.
It wasn't until the day she was being discharged from the hospital. Cadoc got a call about an urgent issue at the company. He had to attend a meeting.
""Go home on your own,"" he said as he turned and left.
Emma just nodded and slowly made her way out.
As she was walking down the stairs, she accidentally bumped into someone.
""Are you blind?!"" the man snapped. ""You know how much this outfit costs? With the way you're dressed, could you even pay for it?""
Before Emma could apologize, a sharp voice came from behind.
""Get lost!""
Cadoc had gotten out of the car. He pulled out a wad of cash and tossed it in that man's face. ""Is this enough?""
That man wanted to argue. But when he saw Cadoc's clothes and aura, he bolted in panic.
Cadoc turned to Emma coldly. ""Ella, don't our families give you money? Why are you dressed like this?""
She stayed quiet.
The Jefferson family never gave her money. Even though the Fitzgerald family gave her a black card, she wasn't the real Ella, so she never touched it.
Cadoc seemed annoyed by her silence and dragged her into the car.
""We're going shopping.""
At the mall, he picked out a bunch of designer outfits for her, each of which was expensive.
Emma didn't protest. She just quietly followed along like an emotionless puppet.
But as they were walking out of the mall, a shaky voice called out.
""Cadoc?""
Emma looked up and saw Sophie not far away, still dressed in a part-time waiter uniform. Her eyes were red and full of disbelief.
""You told me you had an emergency meeting at the office.""
""Sophie..."" Cadoc's expression changed slightly.
""It's fine if you don't love me."" Sophie's tears fell. ""But how could you lie to me? I should've never come back. I'm just in the way.""
She turned and ran.
""Sophie!"" Cadoc shouted and chased after her.
Emma stood still, quietly watching him go. She only felt calm.
But then—
Crash!
Glass from high above in the mall suddenly shattered and struck Sophie's head.
She collapsed into a pool of blood without even making a sound.

Chapter 4
Cadoc's face instantly changed. He sprinted over, scooped Sophie into his arms, and rushed off to the hospital without looking back.
Emma stood there, hands slowly curling into fists, then quietly followed behind.
Beneath the dim glow of the hospital corridor, the lights inside the operating room remained on.
Cadoc waited outside, blood still staining his suit. A trace of worry surfaced on his usually calm and collected face.
Emma sat nearby, not saying anything.
Suddenly, the door burst open, and a doctor stepped out in a rush. ""She's lost a lot of blood and needs a transfusion, but she's RH negative. We don't have any in stock!""
Cadoc frowned. He was about to say something when Emma stood up and said, ""I have Rh-negative blood. I can donate to her.""
He turned sharply toward her, clearly surprised.
Emma met his eyes calmly. ""Helping her matters more.""
She followed the nurse without hesitation. Blood slowly flowed from her arm, and her face turned pale, but she stayed steady.
Cadoc stood there, watching the needle in her arm, feeling a strange twist in his chest.
How much did she care about him?
After the donation, Emma walked out holding cotton to her arm. Cadoc was still planted by the operating room door.
She paused, then went over to him and whispered, ""Don't worry. She'll be fine.""
He looked over, voice a bit hoarse. ""Why don't you leave?""
Emma shook her head. ""Ms. Powell has the wrong idea about us. I want to clear it up when she wakes up.""
He stared at her pale face and suddenly asked, ""Do you like me that much?""
She froze.
Just as she was about to speak, the doctor came out of the operating room. ""She's stable. She'll regain consciousness once the anestthesia wears off.""
Cadoc's body finally relaxed.
Emma didn't say anything else. She just stepped back and stayed quiet.
A few hours passed, and Sophie opened her eyes.
As soon as she saw Emma by the bed, her eyes welled up. ""Cadoc, did you bring her here just so I could give you two my blessing?""
Emma quickly stepped forward. ""No, Ms. Powell. You've got it wrong. Cadoc did have a meeting. He just took me to buy some clothes on the way. It wasn't a date. He wasn't lying.""
Cadoc added, ""We're only married. There's no love between us.""
Sophie sniffled, biting her lip. ""How can you prove you don't have any feelings for her?""
He looked frustrated. ""What kind of proof are you looking for?""
She paused, then suddenly pointed out the window. ""Throw her into the frozen lake.""
His face tightened. ""Sophie...""
""You hesitated."" Her voice shook. ""You do like her.""
He went silent. Then, with a deep sigh, he turned and signaled the bodyguards. ""Throw her into the lake.""
Emma's eyes widened.
She already knew Cadoc would do anything for Sophie, but she didn't expect him to be so cruel.
Still, she couldn't resist. She had to take it.
The bodyguard dragged her away while Cadoc stood still, watching with a blank expression.
The lake was freezing.
The moment Emma was shoved down, she felt like she could barely breathe.
Water rushed into her nose and mouth. Her limbs quickly went numb.
She fought to stay afloat, but her body kept sinking.
The bodyguards on the shore just stared. Not a single one of them stepped in.
Her vision blurred. Everything started to fade. She thought she saw her younger self.
Left behind in the countryside by her parents, she had no warm clothes during the winter and trembled from the cold. Her only refuge was curling up in the woodshed at her nanny's house to stay warm.
No one ever cared about her.
Eventually, someone pulled her out of the lake.
Her body was freezing, her lips had turned pale, and she had slipped into unconsciousness.
In a trance, she felt someone gently wiping her body with a warm towel. The touch was gentle.
She instinctively grabbed the hand and whispered, ""Just a little longer... I can leave soon...""
Suddenly, someone gripped her so tightly that it hurt.
""What do you mean?!"" Cadoc's voice was trembling cold.

Chapter 5
Emma opened her eyes in pain and realized she was back at the Fitzgerald's villa.
Cadoc sat next to her bed, his face clouded. ""What did you mean earlier about leaving?""
Her heart gave a small jolt. She forced a dry laugh and played dumb. ""Huh? I don't even remember what I said. I probably had a fever and was rambling.""
He stared at her for a while before loosening his grip on her hand. ""You were in the lake for a long time. Why didn't you say you were on your period?""
Emma smiled weakly. ""If jumping into the lake made her forgive you, I'd rather not say it.""
His face twisted with a mix of emotions. ""You care that much about me?""
She looked down.
It wasn't about love.
She only wanted to keep the peace between the two families. Once Ella came back, she could leave.
Just then, the door flew open, and Sophie strolled in. ""Cadoc, when are we going fishing?""
Seeing Emma awake, she acted surprised. ""Ms. Jefferson, you're up! Feeling better?""
Before Emma could reply, Sophie kept talking. ""I kinda lost it the other day and told Cadoc to throw you in. I didn't expect that he would do that. I'm so sorry.
""I heard you donated blood to me. That was super generous. Let's go fishing together. My treat.""
Emma was about to decline, but Sophie was already grabbing her hand sweetly. ""Please don't say no. I already told Cadoc.""
Cadoc shot a glance at Emma, subtly signaling her not to ruin the mood.
So, she nodded reluctantly.
Out on the fancy yacht, the salty breeze blew gently.
Sophie clung to Cadoc the entire time, laughing as she got him to feed her fruit, put sunscreen on her back, and even asked him to carry her for a better view of the sea.
Emma stood on the deck, gazing out quietly at the horizon, like none of it involved her.
When Cadoc stepped away to take a phone call, Sophie walked over. ""I don't get you sometimes,"" she said out of nowhere.
Emma glanced over.
Sophie squinted. ""Everyone says you're head over heels for Cadoc and would do anything for him. But isn't loving someone about wanting him for yourself?
""I set you up and made you apologize—you didn't react. He tossed you into a frozen lake—and you still didn't react. Even now, I'm being intimate with him, but you don't even care.""
She stepped closer and lowered her voice. ""Do you even like him?""
Emma twitched her lips. Sophie had hit the nail on the head.
She didn't like Cadoc.
Before she could respond, a giant wave hit them.
""Ah!""
Both of them lost their balance and tumbled into the sea.
Cold seawater slammed over their heads. As they struggled, the metal edge of the yacht scraped deep cuts into their arms, leaving red trails behind in the water.
""Someone fell in! Get help!""
Panic broke out on deck. A rescuer jumped in but came back up quickly. He said seriously, ""Mr. Fitzgerald, their blood will attract sharks! They fell in different directions. We only have time to save one of them first!""
Cadoc's face went pale as his eyes darted across the waves.
Sophie thrashed in one direction, and Emma was drifting farther away the other way.
""Save Sophie first!"" he shouted.
Emma heard him. She coughed up seawater, gasping for air.
Through blurry eyes, she saw the rescue team swimming toward Sophie. She caught sight of the worry on Cadoc's face, gave a bitter smile, and slowly shut her eyes.
She should have known.
In his heart, she was always the extra—easy to throw away.
The seawater filled her lungs, and her consciousness gradually faded.
Before everything went black, she saw something dark swimming straight toward her.
It was a shark!
Then came the sharp, searing pain in her leg. The last thing she saw was the sea turning red.

Chapter 6
When Emma woke up, the first thing she saw was the white hospital ceiling above her.
""You're finally awake!"" the nurse said with relief. ""Your injuries are serious. We need to get in touch with your family right away.""
She paused for a second and sighed. ""Ms. Powell is next door. She also fell into the sea. She didn't get hurt as badly as you did, but Mr. Fitzgerald hasn't left her side. He treats her like she's priceless. Where's your family? It's been two days, and nobody has shown up.""
Emma stayed quiet, her lips pressed together.
Suddenly, the ward door flew open.
Cadoc stood there, his stare cold and sharp like a knife.
The nurse looked surprised to see him. But after a glance at his face, she quickly slipped out.
As soon as the door shut, Cadoc knocked over the medicine tray. Glass shattered loudly, and pills spilled everywhere.
""Did you push Sophie into the sea?"" His voice was cold.
Emma was stunned.
She had no idea why Sophie wanted to frame her. She felt nothing but exhaustion. ""No. I didn't.""
""Still lying?"" Cadoc snapped, gripping her wrist so tightly it hurt. ""Sophie told me everything herself! You used to be so generous—what changed?""
He sneered, like he understood something. ""Don't tell me all that tolerance before was just an act. Were you just trying to get my attention?""
Emma's face went pale from the pain, but she just looked at him without saying a word.
That only made him angrier.
He threw her hand aside violently. ""Fine. Since you won't admit what you did, you'll bear the fallout.""
He walked toward the door, his voice sharp and cold. ""No more nurses. No one is going to help you. Deal with your injuries on your own.""
The next few days were brutal.
No doctor came to check on her, and no nurse changed her bandages. She had to drag her battered body to the medicine cabinet and apply the treatment herself with shaking hands.
She fell to the ground multiple times, scraping and bruising her knees, but she kept pushing through and getting back up.
Cadoc probably thought that the eldest daughter of the Jefferson family couldn't handle such torture.
But he didn't know that she wasn't Ella. She wasn't a socialite who grew up in luxury.
She was Emma, who was raised in the countryside. She was abandoned by her parents at a young age and forced to face her illnesses all on her own.
That pain was nothing to her.
A few days later, Emma had just finished signing her discharge papers and was packing up her things when the door slammed open.
Cadoc barged in and yanked her wrist. ""Come with me.""
She frowned. ""What is it now?""
""Sophie was kidnapped by Levi,"" he said tensely, ""He's demanding you in exchange. He promised to let you go after three days.""
Emma froze.
Levi Ziegler was infamous for being a creep in their circle. Every time he looked at her, his cold stare felt clingy and revolting.
""I'm not going,"" she said firmly.
Cadoc's expression darkened. ""That's not your decision.""
Then, he suddenly softened his voice. ""He's obsessed with you. He won't hurt you. As long as you do what he says, I'll agree to whatever you want afterward.""
Emma stared at him, then gave a small smile. ""Alright. I want a wedding.""
Cadoc was startled. ""What?""
""We only got the marriage certificates. I want a real ceremony,"" she said softly, ""Make up for what I never had.""
That was part of her plan.
When Ella returned, a grand wedding would prove she was Cadoc's legal wife.
Cadoc was silent for a while, then gave a short nod. ""Fine. I promise you.""
When Emma arrived at the Ziegler's villa, Levi was lounging on the couch, grinning at her.
""It's been a while, Mrs. Fitzgerald.""
He ran a finger along her face. Though she felt sick, she kept her cool and didn't move away.
The first two days of torment were relatively mild. Levi simply had people take her blood, one vial after another.
She got used to the feeling of needles. But watching her blood fill those tubes made her stomach turn.
Then came the third day. Half-asleep, she overheard the bodyguards talking outside.
""Has Mr. Ziegler lost it? Is he truly planning to turn her into a specimen?""
""He said she's so beautiful that she should be preserved forever if she dies.""
Emma's blood ran cold.
Cadoc promised she'd be safe. Instead, she was going to die here.
A chill crept through her whole body. She bit her lip until she tasted blood just to stop herself from shaking.
Seizing a moment of the bodyguards' carelessness, she grabbed a crystal ornament from the bedside and hurled it at the window.
Crash!
Glass shards went flying. She picked up a shard, cut herself free, and jumped from the second story. A sharp snap came from her ankle as she hit the ground.
Pain shot through her leg, but she didn't stop.
With a sprained ankle, she limped out of the Ziegler's villa and made her way back to the Fitzgerald's villa.
As she stepped into the living room, she saw Cadoc down on one knee, gently tending to Sophie's ankle with medication.
""Cadoc..."" Sophie's eyes were red. ""Ms. Jefferson has been gone this long. Are you not worried at all?""
Cadoc froze for a second. Then, he spoke softly, ""I only care about you. Why didn't you tell me you were hurt? You know that breaks my heart.""
Emma stood soaking wet in the doorway, her ankle swollen and throbbing, but he didn't even notice.
She walked past them blankly.
""Ella?"" Cadoc finally looked up and jumped to his feet. ""You—""

Chapter 7
Cadoc gave her a once-over, checking if she was hurt. When he saw she was fine, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. ""What happened these last three days?""
Emma smiled bitterly, her lips cracked and bleeding. ""Nothing.""
She didn't waste time and asked, ""When will you hold the wedding you promised me?""
Sophie snapped her head up. ""What wedding?""
Cadoc paused before answering, ""We're having a ceremony.""
Seeing Sophie's eyes go red, he immediately explained, ""It's just a ceremony, Sophie. I only care about you.""
She forced a smile. ""I get it. I'm not upset. You're just trying to save me.""
Then, she turned to Emma and smiled sweetly. ""Ms. Jefferson, how about I help you pick out the perfect wedding dress?""
Over the next few days, Sophie stuck to Emma like glue as she tried on wedding dresses.
At the bridal boutique, Emma stood in front of the mirror wearing a white wedding dress that hugged her waist nicely. Sophie stayed close, inspecting every dress and nitpicking every little thing.
""This one's neckline is way too low,"" Sophie said, tugging at the fabric near Emma's collar. ""Change to something more conservative.""
Then, she grabbed another dress and commented, ""This cut doesn't do your figure any favors. Mrs. Fitzgerald should never look this basic.""
Emma stayed silent, doing whatever she was told like a lifeless puppet.
When they finally settled on a dress, Sophie dropped her fake act in the now-empty fitting room.
""So you're not truly distant—you're just playing hard to get.""
She gripped Emma's wrist hard, her nails digging in. ""Don't think you can just steal Cadoc from me. He's mine!""
Emma didn't react. She pulled her hand away without saying a word.
There was no act of playing hard to get, and she never meant to steal Cadoc away.
She wanted out of this mess more than anyone.
But Sophie was convinced Emma was trying to take Cadoc from her and started stirring up more drama.
On the eve of the wedding, Cadoc kicked Emma's door open.
""You locked Sophie in the fitting room?!"" he said gloomily, ""Do you know she has claustrophobia?!""
Emma shut her eyes tiredly. ""It wasn't me.""
""You're still denying it?"" he shouted, yanking her up. ""Looks like you haven't learned your lesson.""
Ignoring her protests, he told the bodyguards to throw her into a dark, musty basement.
In the pitch black, Emma curled up in the corner. Sometime after midnight, she heard faint noises.
Then, a bag of live rats had been tossed in.
She screamed, bolted upright, and started pounding on the door. Her nails tore, but no one answered her calls of agony.
The next morning, Cadoc opened the door coldly. ""It was just one night. Do you have to cry all night?""
After enduring a night of torment, Emma looked drained and pale. ""Sophie sent the rats in...""
Cadoc scoffed. ""Sophie would never do anything like that.""
He flipped on the light. ""Where are those rats then?""
Emma's eyes widened.
The basement was spotless—not a rat or even a trace left behind.
Sophie had erased all the proof.
Emma wanted to explain, but she gave up.
Cadoc's voice turned cold. ""The wedding is in three days. I'll be spending time with Sophie until then. I'll show up on that day.""
He shot her a warning glare. ""Don't do anything stvpid. Otherwise, the wedding is off.""

Chapter 8
Cadoc threw those words out coldly before turning and walking away.
His footsteps faded into the distance as Emma slowly pushed herself up, using the wall for support.
She shut herself away in her room for the next three days, barely stepping outside.
She barely touched the meals the maids brought her, just picking at a few bites. No matter how sunny it got, she refused to leave her room.
She didn't want to give Sophie another shot at setting her up.
Cadoc, like he promised, stayed with Sophie the entire time and didn't even come home.
Emma saw their outings all over the gossip sites.
Sophie clung to Cadoc's arm, flashing a sweet smile. And Cadoc? He looked down at her gently.
The day before the wedding, Emma sat at her desk, scribbling a list of everything Cadoc liked and couldn't stand.
""He hates cilantro and can't handle spicy food. He only drinks coffee without sugar. His shirts must be perfectly ironed. He needs pitch darkness to sleep...""
After writing, she folded the note neatly and called over the maid, Tiana Rivera.
""Hold on to this for me,"" she said softly. ""Give it back after the wedding.""
Tiana blinked in confusion. ""Mrs. Fitzgerald, what's this for?""
""In case I forget. "" Emma smiled slightly. ""You know how bad my memory has been lately.""
Tiana still looked puzzled, but she nodded and took the note. ""Alright, Mrs. Fitzgerald. I'll keep it safe.""
After Tiana left, Emma pulled out a suitcase she had packed days ago from the back of the closet.
She glanced around the room she'd called home for three years, her eyes pausing on the wedding photo on the wall.
Cadoc looked handsome in his suit, and she was in a stunning gown, smiling softly.
Emma took the photo down, laid it face down on the table, and walked out without looking back.
At the airport lobby, Zoey had been waiting.
She handed Emma a plane ticket and a bank card. ""That's five million. From now on, you have zero ties to the Jefferson family.""
Emma's fingers shook slightly as she accepted them.
When she looked up, Zoey wasn't even looking at her.
""Thanks,"" Emma said softly.
Zoey's tone stayed cold. ""You've done a good job in the past three years. The partnership between the families stayed intact.""
She paused before adding, ""Go live the life you want.""
Emma nodded, turned, and headed toward the security gate.
Before turning the corner, she took one last glance back. Zoey was already gone. Her figure looked so firm, like Emma had never been her daughter at all.
But Emma didn't feel broken. She held the plane ticket tightly, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.
This time, she could finally live for herself.
Without looking back, she walked straight toward the boarding gate.
At the Fitzgerald's villa, a woman who looked almost identical to Emma slipped into a wedding dress and sat quietly, waiting for the ceremony the next day.

1njzafg,https://i.redd.it/qp6i3yvstupf1.jpeg,A marriage made of lies free link please!!,"After pretending to be her sister and married with Cadoc for three years, Emma Jefferson can finally leave him now.
""Your sister will be back in a month. Until then, you have to keep pretending to be her,"" her mother, Zoey Jefferson, said coldly over the phone. ""Once that's done, I'll transfer five million to you. Then you're free to do whatever you want.""
""Okay,"" Emma replied softly, her voice calm.
After she hung up, she stared at the giant wedding photo on the wall.
Cadoc looked handsome in his suit, and she was in a stunning gown, smiling softly.
""It's been three years,"" she whispered, brushing her finger across the photo frame. ""It's finally over.""
Three years ago, the marriage between the Fitzgerald and the Jefferson families made headlines. Her twin sister, Ella Jefferson, had been chosen as the Fitzgerald family's future daughter-in-law.
But on the eve of the wedding, she left a note and vanished.
""Dad, Mom, I don't want to be tied down by marriage, but I know it's my duty. Just give me three years to live freely. I'll come back after that.""
To keep the deal between the two families alive, Zoey and her husband, Dylan Jefferson, had no choice but to bring Emma back—the twin daughter they'd left behind in the countryside since she was a kid.
Emma had never even been allowed at family events, but she became a substitute bride under Ella's name.
""Cadoc doesn't like your sister,"" Zoey said coldly the night before the wedding. ""He's hung up on a poor scholarship girl. Marrying him won't be easy, but just stay in line and get through these three years pretending to be Ella.""
Emma had only nodded back then.
Of course, she knew who Cadoc was. His face was always in finance magazines. He was the most prestigious nobleman among the elites, with socialites practically throwing themselves at him.
She had also heard the story about Sophie.
Sophie was a struggling student sponsored by the Fitzgerald family. She attended a top university on scholarship. Cadoc loved her deeply and wanted to be with her, even against his family's wishes. But Sophie, proud and distant, couldn't accept a relationship without anyone's approval, so she chose to end things and go overseas.
The Fitzgerald family was overjoyed and rushed to arrange Cadoc's marriage.
Married life turned out to be way harder than Emma thought.
Cadoc's study was covered in photos of Sophie. He flew to Paris every week just to see her secretly. Meanwhile, Emma wasn't even allowed to enter the main bedroom. She had to sleep in the guest room at the far end of the hallway.
She was cautious and tried her best to act like Ella. To make sure the partnership between their families' companies wouldn't fall apart, she did everything she could to stay on Cadoc's good side.
If he worked late, she'd leave the lights on and wait by the door. When his stomach acted up, she'd wake up at five every morning to make oatmeal. He liked a quiet house, so she stayed as silent as possible.
Eventually, people started saying she was crazy in love with him. But slowly, the way he looked at her began to shift.
The photos of Sophie vanished from his study. His Paris trips stopped. He started remembering Emma's birthday, came home early when she was sick, and even began sleeping with her.
Emma almost believed that genuine love had somehow come from that substitute marriage.
Then, three months ago, Sophie returned.
Everything flipped back.
Cadoc's attention was on Sophie again. He stopped coming home, and Sophie's photos were back in his study. People mocked Emma like she was some kind of joke. But she never made a scene. She just smiled.
The truth was—she never loved him.
She only stayed for the money and freedom her parents promised. If Cadoc had fallen for her, great. If not, she wouldn't care.
Nobody knew that Emma and Ella might have shared a face, but their lives were nothing alike.
Zoey nearly died giving birth to Emma. Since then, she looked at Emma with nothing but disgust. Dylan doted on Zoey so much that he treated Emma like a jinx.
At age five, Emma was shipped off to live with a nanny in the countryside.
She still remembered that one freezing winter. The heater broke, and she was shaking in the cold without even a proper coat. Meanwhile, Ella was snug in a fancy villa, wrapped in designer clothes, being showered in love.
After 18 years of being treated like she didn't matter, Emma had stopped expecting family affection.
With just a month left, she'd finally get the five million promised for pretending to be Ella. Then, she could leave this place and live life on her terms.
While she was in a good mood, her phone buzzed with a call.
It was Cadoc.
Emma took a breath and picked up. ""Hello?""
He hung up before she could respond. Emma stared at the phone, already knowing who they were for.
He said coldly, ""Bring sanitary pads to the Nightfall Club. Night ones. You've got 20 minutes.""
Outside, the rain was pouring. The drive from the Fitzgerald's villa to the Nightfall Club usually took at least 40 minutes.
Still, Emma grabbed an umbrella and left.
Traffic was awful. With just 12 minutes left, she checked the time, gritted her teeth, and jumped out of the car, running through the rain.
The rain quickly drenched her clothes, and her high heels kept slipping on the slick pavement. She lost her balance and crashed into a puddle, pain searing through her knees.
But she kept going. She finally made it to the club at the 19th minute.
Before knocking on the private room's door, she overheard people laughing inside.
""Mr. Fitzgerald, are you truly asking Ella to come out in this storm just to drop off pads? It'll take at least 40 minutes from your place.""
""Sophie is hurting,"" Cadoc replied indifferently, ""Ella will figure it out.""
""Well, that's right. Everyone knows how deeply Ella loves you. For the past three years, even though your heart belonged to someone else, she's stayed by your side without a single complaint.""
Someone teased, ""Come on, man. Are you sure you weren't tempted by that beauty who's been by your side all these years?""
There was silence. Emma held her breath.
After a pause, Cadoc said, ""Between Sophie and Ella, I'll always choose Sophie.""
His words didn't hurt. Instead, she felt relieved. She waited until the laughter stopped, then knocked on the door.
When she walked in, everyone looked stunned.
""Wow, right on time!""
""Ella, why are you drenched?""
Cadoc got up, frowning. ""Why are you in a mess?""
Emma handed over the well-protected pads. ""You said 20 minutes. I didn't want you to worry, so I ran the rest of the way.""
She didn't bring up the fall or the pain.
Cadoc's expression shifted slightly. He took off his suit jacket and draped it over her shoulders. ""Wear this.""
Then, he motioned toward the pads. ""Take those to the ladies' room.""
Emma nodded and walked off.
At the restroom, she knocked. A soft voice answered, ""Who is it?""
""I brought the pads.""
There was silence for a few seconds, then the door opened slightly. Emma handed them over without a word and left.
Back home, she took a hot bath. Her scraped knee stung.
Lying in bed, she finally felt at peace. Freedom was so close she could taste it.
But before she could sleep, the door burst open.
Cadoc stormed in, grabbed her wrist. ""Get up!""
Before Emma could react, he yanked her out of bed and dragged her toward the stairs.
""Cadoc? What are you—""
Before she could finish speaking, he shoved her hard, knocking her backward. The back of her head struck the step hard as she tumbled down the stairs.
Severe pain exploded through her whole body.
Lying at the bottom, she struggled to move. Her vision was fuzzy, blood trickling down her face.
""Why... Why are you doing this?!""
Cadoc stood above her, his face shadowed. His voice was chillingly cold.
""Did you push Sophie?""
Emma stared up, confused. ""What?""
""Drop the act!"" He stepped closer. ""You've been acting all generous just waiting for a chance, right? You shoved her out the window. She's broken all over and almost died!""
""I didn't..."" She shook her head weakly. The movement aggravated the wound on her head, making her feel lightheaded and dizzy.
Cadoc squatted down, grabbing her chin. ""Ella, have you started thinking I care about you? We're only married, not in love.""
He leaned in and emphasized, ""I'll never love you!""
Emma felt pain all over. But instead of crying, she almost laughed.
She never wanted his love in the first place.

Chapter 2
Emma was about to say something, but Cadoc yanked her up coldly.
""Cut the act,"" he said coldly. ""Sophie fell from the fifth floor. You only tumbled down from the second.
""Get up. We're going to the hospital—you're going to apologize.""
He dragged her out like he didn't even notice the blood still dripping from her forehead or how her injured knee was bleeding again. Every step she took felt like she was walking on knives.
He shoved her into the car, and neither of them said a word the entire ride.
Emma stared blankly out the window, watching the scenery go by. She told herself to hold on a little longer. Freedom was almost here.
At the hospital, Sophie sat propped up in bed, looking pale, her wrists covered in bandages.
The second she spotted Emma, she shrank back. Her eyes filled with tears.
""Cadoc..."" she whimpered, voice shaking. ""I-I don't want to see her...""
Cadoc rushed to her side, took her hand, and said softly, ""Don't worry. I'm here. No one is going to hurt you.""
Then, he turned to Emma, his expression hard. ""Why are you just standing there? Apologize.""
Emma looked exhausted, but her voice was calm.
She stared at Sophie and asked softly, ""Ms. Powell, are you truly saying I pushed you off that window?""
Sophie's lashes fluttered. Her eyes filled with tears again. ""Ms. Jefferson, if you're not willing to apologize, it's fine. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.""
She sniffled and looked pitiful. ""Cadoc has been staying by my side lately. I get why you hate me. But your marriage wasn't about love. If I came from the right kind of family, you wouldn't even be in the picture...""
Her crying got worse, and Cadoc's face got darker.
He interrupted sharply, ""Ella! I told you to apologize, not pick a fight! Are you gonna do it or not?""
Emma closed her eyes for a second. She knew Sophie was framing her, but she was leaving soon.
She couldn't afford any issues in the partnership between the two families. Otherwise, she'd lose the five million and her chance at freedom.
So, she just said, ""I'm sorry. I was wrong.""
Then, she turned to leave.
But Cadoc stopped her. ""Wait. Since you pushed her, you should stay and take care of her until she's out of the hospital.""
Emma's fingers twitched slightly, but she nodded. ""Alright.""
In the following days, Emma stayed quietly in Sophie's ward.
Cadoc practically moved into the hospital, ignoring work and feeding Sophie oatmeal, helping her wash up, and coaxing her to sleep.
He never did those for Emma.
But she never looked upset. She just took care of Sophie calmly, like it was just another chore.
The nurses whispered about it behind her back.
""Wow, I've never seen a wife this generous!""
""You don't get it. This is love at its most selfless."" Another nurse sighed. ""She's so in love with Mr. Fitzgerald that she's even willing to care for the woman he loves—just to get a little more of his attention. How pitiful.""
Cadoc happened to walk by and overheard.
He stopped in his tracks and glanced toward the ward.
Emma sat with her head down, carefully peeling an apple. Her profile looked calm and tender.
A strange feeling suddenly stirred in Cadoc's heart.
When the day finally came for Sophie to leave the hospital, Cadoc told Emma straight up, ""I'm taking Sophie on a trip. Don't contact me unless it's urgent.""
Emma nodded. ""Got it.""
She watched them walk away hand in hand and felt lighter.
Finally, she didn't have to deal with them anymore.
As soon as she got home, she began packing her luggage, getting ready to leave soon.
A few days later, she came across Sophie's latest Instagram post.
Cadoc had taken her to the Maldives. He'd made an unlimited bid for her at an auction and spent a fortune on her favorite jewelry.
Emma looked at it for a second, then just scrolled past.
She didn't care.
She never did.

Chapter 3
A week later, it was time for the Fitzgerald family's regular monthly dinner.
Since Cadoc wasn't around, Emma had to show up on her own.
When Cadoc's mother, Amanda Fitzgerald, saw Emma walk in, her expression darkened. ""Where's Cadoc?""
Emma kept her head down. ""He's busy with something. He couldn't make it back.""
Amanda sneered and was about to respond when the butler rushed over and handed her an entertainment newspaper.
The headline was a photo of Cadoc and Sophie kissing on a yacht.
Amanda slammed her fork down. ""Ella! Come with me now!""
She stormed off to the study. As soon as the door shut, she yelled, ""Get on your knees!""
Without saying a word, Emma dropped to her knees.
""You trash!"" Amanda was shaking with rage. ""You can't even keep your husband! You've got two choices—call him home now or take your punishment!""
Emma's lashes fluttered.
She knew that no matter how many times she called, Cadoc wouldn't show up.
He was probably wrapped up in a cozy getaway with Sophie. If she bothered him, the deal between their families could fall apart.
""I'll take the punishment,"" she said softly.
Amanda was pis-sed off. ""What did you just say?""
""I choose the punishment."" Emma raised her head calmly. ""Go ahead.""
Flushed with anger, Amanda grabbed the whip hanging on the wall and hit it hard on Emma's back.
""Still not calling him?""
Slap!
""How about now?!""
Slap!
Emma bit her lips tightly, pain searing through her body, but she only shook her head.
Eventually, she passed out.
When she woke up, she was lying in a hospital bed, her back wrapped in thick bandages.
Cadoc was sitting nearby, looking annoyed.
""My mom was giving you a hard time. Why didn't you just call me?"" he asked coldly.
Emma gave him a weak smile. ""I didn't want to ruin your date with Ms. Powell.""
He froze.
Her pale face reminded him of something the nurse had said.
""She's so in love with Mr. Fitzgerald that she's even willing to care for the woman he loves...""
Did she love him so deeply that she'd rather face punishment than bother him?
Cadoc felt an even deeper sense of unease growing in his heart.
For the next few days, he stayed at the hospital to look after her for the first time.
Emma didn't need his help, but he didn't leave.
It wasn't until the day she was being discharged from the hospital. Cadoc got a call about an urgent issue at the company. He had to attend a meeting.
""Go home on your own,"" he said as he turned and left.
Emma just nodded and slowly made her way out.
As she was walking down the stairs, she accidentally bumped into someone.
""Are you blind?!"" the man snapped. ""You know how much this outfit costs? With the way you're dressed, could you even pay for it?""
Before Emma could apologize, a sharp voice came from behind.
""Get lost!""
Cadoc had gotten out of the car. He pulled out a wad of cash and tossed it in that man's face. ""Is this enough?""
That man wanted to argue. But when he saw Cadoc's clothes and aura, he bolted in panic.
Cadoc turned to Emma coldly. ""Ella, don't our families give you money? Why are you dressed like this?""
She stayed quiet.
The Jefferson family never gave her money. Even though the Fitzgerald family gave her a black card, she wasn't the real Ella, so she never touched it.
Cadoc seemed annoyed by her silence and dragged her into the car.
""We're going shopping.""
At the mall, he picked out a bunch of designer outfits for her, each of which was expensive.
Emma didn't protest. She just quietly followed along like an emotionless puppet.
But as they were walking out of the mall, a shaky voice called out.
""Cadoc?""
Emma looked up and saw Sophie not far away, still dressed in a part-time waiter uniform. Her eyes were red and full of disbelief.
""You told me you had an emergency meeting at the office.""
""Sophie..."" Cadoc's expression changed slightly.
""It's fine if you don't love me."" Sophie's tears fell. ""But how could you lie to me? I should've never come back. I'm just in the way.""
She turned and ran.
""Sophie!"" Cadoc shouted and chased after her.
Emma stood still, quietly watching him go. She only felt calm.
But then—
Crash!
Glass from high above in the mall suddenly shattered and struck Sophie's head.
She collapsed into a pool of blood without even making a sound.

Chapter 4
Cadoc's face instantly changed. He sprinted over, scooped Sophie into his arms, and rushed off to the hospital without looking back.
Emma stood there, hands slowly curling into fists, then quietly followed behind.
Beneath the dim glow of the hospital corridor, the lights inside the operating room remained on.
Cadoc waited outside, blood still staining his suit. A trace of worry surfaced on his usually calm and collected face.
Emma sat nearby, not saying anything.
Suddenly, the door burst open, and a doctor stepped out in a rush. ""She's lost a lot of blood and needs a transfusion, but she's RH negative. We don't have any in stock!""
Cadoc frowned. He was about to say something when Emma stood up and said, ""I have Rh-negative blood. I can donate to her.""
He turned sharply toward her, clearly surprised.
Emma met his eyes calmly. ""Helping her matters more.""
She followed the nurse without hesitation. Blood slowly flowed from her arm, and her face turned pale, but she stayed steady.
Cadoc stood there, watching the needle in her arm, feeling a strange twist in his chest.
How much did she care about him?
After the donation, Emma walked out holding cotton to her arm. Cadoc was still planted by the operating room door.
She paused, then went over to him and whispered, ""Don't worry. She'll be fine.""
He looked over, voice a bit hoarse. ""Why don't you leave?""
Emma shook her head. ""Ms. Powell has the wrong idea about us. I want to clear it up when she wakes up.""
He stared at her pale face and suddenly asked, ""Do you like me that much?""
She froze.
Just as she was about to speak, the doctor came out of the operating room. ""She's stable. She'll regain consciousness once the anestthesia wears off.""
Cadoc's body finally relaxed.
Emma didn't say anything else. She just stepped back and stayed quiet.
A few hours passed, and Sophie opened her eyes.
As soon as she saw Emma by the bed, her eyes welled up. ""Cadoc, did you bring her here just so I could give you two my blessing?""
Emma quickly stepped forward. ""No, Ms. Powell. You've got it wrong. Cadoc did have a meeting. He just took me to buy some clothes on the way. It wasn't a date. He wasn't lying.""
Cadoc added, ""We're only married. There's no love between us.""
Sophie sniffled, biting her lip. ""How can you prove you don't have any feelings for her?""
He looked frustrated. ""What kind of proof are you looking for?""
She paused, then suddenly pointed out the window. ""Throw her into the frozen lake.""
His face tightened. ""Sophie...""
""You hesitated."" Her voice shook. ""You do like her.""
He went silent. Then, with a deep sigh, he turned and signaled the bodyguards. ""Throw her into the lake.""
Emma's eyes widened.
She already knew Cadoc would do anything for Sophie, but she didn't expect him to be so cruel.
Still, she couldn't resist. She had to take it.
The bodyguard dragged her away while Cadoc stood still, watching with a blank expression.
The lake was freezing.
The moment Emma was shoved down, she felt like she could barely breathe.
Water rushed into her nose and mouth. Her limbs quickly went numb.
She fought to stay afloat, but her body kept sinking.
The bodyguards on the shore just stared. Not a single one of them stepped in.
Her vision blurred. Everything started to fade. She thought she saw her younger self.
Left behind in the countryside by her parents, she had no warm clothes during the winter and trembled from the cold. Her only refuge was curling up in the woodshed at her nanny's house to stay warm.
No one ever cared about her.
Eventually, someone pulled her out of the lake.
Her body was freezing, her lips had turned pale, and she had slipped into unconsciousness.
In a trance, she felt someone gently wiping her body with a warm towel. The touch was gentle.
She instinctively grabbed the hand and whispered, ""Just a little longer... I can leave soon...""
Suddenly, someone gripped her so tightly that it hurt.
""What do you mean?!"" Cadoc's voice was trembling cold.

Chapter 5
Emma opened her eyes in pain and realized she was back at the Fitzgerald's villa.
Cadoc sat next to her bed, his face clouded. ""What did you mean earlier about leaving?""
Her heart gave a small jolt. She forced a dry laugh and played dumb. ""Huh? I don't even remember what I said. I probably had a fever and was rambling.""
He stared at her for a while before loosening his grip on her hand. ""You were in the lake for a long time. Why didn't you say you were on your period?""
Emma smiled weakly. ""If jumping into the lake made her forgive you, I'd rather not say it.""
His face twisted with a mix of emotions. ""You care that much about me?""
She looked down.
It wasn't about love.
She only wanted to keep the peace between the two families. Once Ella came back, she could leave.
Just then, the door flew open, and Sophie strolled in. ""Cadoc, when are we going fishing?""
Seeing Emma awake, she acted surprised. ""Ms. Jefferson, you're up! Feeling better?""
Before Emma could reply, Sophie kept talking. ""I kinda lost it the other day and told Cadoc to throw you in. I didn't expect that he would do that. I'm so sorry.
""I heard you donated blood to me. That was super generous. Let's go fishing together. My treat.""
Emma was about to decline, but Sophie was already grabbing her hand sweetly. ""Please don't say no. I already told Cadoc.""
Cadoc shot a glance at Emma, subtly signaling her not to ruin the mood.
So, she nodded reluctantly.
Out on the fancy yacht, the salty breeze blew gently.
Sophie clung to Cadoc the entire time, laughing as she got him to feed her fruit, put sunscreen on her back, and even asked him to carry her for a better view of the sea.
Emma stood on the deck, gazing out quietly at the horizon, like none of it involved her.
When Cadoc stepped away to take a phone call, Sophie walked over. ""I don't get you sometimes,"" she said out of nowhere.
Emma glanced over.
Sophie squinted. ""Everyone says you're head over heels for Cadoc and would do anything for him. But isn't loving someone about wanting him for yourself?
""I set you up and made you apologize—you didn't react. He tossed you into a frozen lake—and you still didn't react. Even now, I'm being intimate with him, but you don't even care.""
She stepped closer and lowered her voice. ""Do you even like him?""
Emma twitched her lips. Sophie had hit the nail on the head.
She didn't like Cadoc.
Before she could respond, a giant wave hit them.
""Ah!""
Both of them lost their balance and tumbled into the sea.
Cold seawater slammed over their heads. As they struggled, the metal edge of the yacht scraped deep cuts into their arms, leaving red trails behind in the water.
""Someone fell in! Get help!""
Panic broke out on deck. A rescuer jumped in but came back up quickly. He said seriously, ""Mr. Fitzgerald, their blood will attract sharks! They fell in different directions. We only have time to save one of them first!""
Cadoc's face went pale as his eyes darted across the waves.
Sophie thrashed in one direction, and Emma was drifting farther away the other way.
""Save Sophie first!"" he shouted.
Emma heard him. She coughed up seawater, gasping for air.
Through blurry eyes, she saw the rescue team swimming toward Sophie. She caught sight of the worry on Cadoc's face, gave a bitter smile, and slowly shut her eyes.
She should have known.
In his heart, she was always the extra—easy to throw away.
The seawater filled her lungs, and her consciousness gradually faded.
Before everything went black, she saw something dark swimming straight toward her.
It was a shark!
Then came the sharp, searing pain in her leg. The last thing she saw was the sea turning red.

Chapter 6
When Emma woke up, the first thing she saw was the white hospital ceiling above her.
""You're finally awake!"" the nurse said with relief. ""Your injuries are serious. We need to get in touch with your family right away.""
She paused for a second and sighed. ""Ms. Powell is next door. She also fell into the sea. She didn't get hurt as badly as you did, but Mr. Fitzgerald hasn't left her side. He treats her like she's priceless. Where's your family? It's been two days, and nobody has shown up.""
Emma stayed quiet, her lips pressed together.
Suddenly, the ward door flew open.
Cadoc stood there, his stare cold and sharp like a knife.
The nurse looked surprised to see him. But after a glance at his face, she quickly slipped out.
As soon as the door shut, Cadoc knocked over the medicine tray. Glass shattered loudly, and pills spilled everywhere.
""Did you push Sophie into the sea?"" His voice was cold.
Emma was stunned.
She had no idea why Sophie wanted to frame her. She felt nothing but exhaustion. ""No. I didn't.""
""Still lying?"" Cadoc snapped, gripping her wrist so tightly it hurt. ""Sophie told me everything herself! You used to be so generous—what changed?""
He sneered, like he understood something. ""Don't tell me all that tolerance before was just an act. Were you just trying to get my attention?""
Emma's face went pale from the pain, but she just looked at him without saying a word.
That only made him angrier.
He threw her hand aside violently. ""Fine. Since you won't admit what you did, you'll bear the fallout.""
He walked toward the door, his voice sharp and cold. ""No more nurses. No one is going to help you. Deal with your injuries on your own.""
The next few days were brutal.
No doctor came to check on her, and no nurse changed her bandages. She had to drag her battered body to the medicine cabinet and apply the treatment herself with shaking hands.
She fell to the ground multiple times, scraping and bruising her knees, but she kept pushing through and getting back up.
Cadoc probably thought that the eldest daughter of the Jefferson family couldn't handle such torture.
But he didn't know that she wasn't Ella. She wasn't a socialite who grew up in luxury.
She was Emma, who was raised in the countryside. She was abandoned by her parents at a young age and forced to face her illnesses all on her own.
That pain was nothing to her.
A few days later, Emma had just finished signing her discharge papers and was packing up her things when the door slammed open.
Cadoc barged in and yanked her wrist. ""Come with me.""
She frowned. ""What is it now?""
""Sophie was kidnapped by Levi,"" he said tensely, ""He's demanding you in exchange. He promised to let you go after three days.""
Emma froze.
Levi Ziegler was infamous for being a creep in their circle. Every time he looked at her, his cold stare felt clingy and revolting.
""I'm not going,"" she said firmly.
Cadoc's expression darkened. ""That's not your decision.""
Then, he suddenly softened his voice. ""He's obsessed with you. He won't hurt you. As long as you do what he says, I'll agree to whatever you want afterward.""
Emma stared at him, then gave a small smile. ""Alright. I want a wedding.""
Cadoc was startled. ""What?""
""We only got the marriage certificates. I want a real ceremony,"" she said softly, ""Make up for what I never had.""
That was part of her plan.
When Ella returned, a grand wedding would prove she was Cadoc's legal wife.
Cadoc was silent for a while, then gave a short nod. ""Fine. I promise you.""
When Emma arrived at the Ziegler's villa, Levi was lounging on the couch, grinning at her.
""It's been a while, Mrs. Fitzgerald.""
He ran a finger along her face. Though she felt sick, she kept her cool and didn't move away.
The first two days of torment were relatively mild. Levi simply had people take her blood, one vial after another.
She got used to the feeling of needles. But watching her blood fill those tubes made her stomach turn.
Then came the third day. Half-asleep, she overheard the bodyguards talking outside.
""Has Mr. Ziegler lost it? Is he truly planning to turn her into a specimen?""
""He said she's so beautiful that she should be preserved forever if she dies.""
Emma's blood ran cold.
Cadoc promised she'd be safe. Instead, she was going to die here.
A chill crept through her whole body. She bit her lip until she tasted blood just to stop herself from shaking.
Seizing a moment of the bodyguards' carelessness, she grabbed a crystal ornament from the bedside and hurled it at the window.
Crash!
Glass shards went flying. She picked up a shard, cut herself free, and jumped from the second story. A sharp snap came from her ankle as she hit the ground.
Pain shot through her leg, but she didn't stop.
With a sprained ankle, she limped out of the Ziegler's villa and made her way back to the Fitzgerald's villa.
As she stepped into the living room, she saw Cadoc down on one knee, gently tending to Sophie's ankle with medication.
""Cadoc..."" Sophie's eyes were red. ""Ms. Jefferson has been gone this long. Are you not worried at all?""
Cadoc froze for a second. Then, he spoke softly, ""I only care about you. Why didn't you tell me you were hurt? You know that breaks my heart.""
Emma stood soaking wet in the doorway, her ankle swollen and throbbing, but he didn't even notice.
She walked past them blankly.
""Ella?"" Cadoc finally looked up and jumped to his feet. ""You—""

Chapter 7
Cadoc gave her a once-over, checking if she was hurt. When he saw she was fine, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. ""What happened these last three days?""
Emma smiled bitterly, her lips cracked and bleeding. ""Nothing.""
She didn't waste time and asked, ""When will you hold the wedding you promised me?""
Sophie snapped her head up. ""What wedding?""
Cadoc paused before answering, ""We're having a ceremony.""
Seeing Sophie's eyes go red, he immediately explained, ""It's just a ceremony, Sophie. I only care about you.""
She forced a smile. ""I get it. I'm not upset. You're just trying to save me.""
Then, she turned to Emma and smiled sweetly. ""Ms. Jefferson, how about I help you pick out the perfect wedding dress?""
Over the next few days, Sophie stuck to Emma like glue as she tried on wedding dresses.
At the bridal boutique, Emma stood in front of the mirror wearing a white wedding dress that hugged her waist nicely. Sophie stayed close, inspecting every dress and nitpicking every little thing.
""This one's neckline is way too low,"" Sophie said, tugging at the fabric near Emma's collar. ""Change to something more conservative.""
Then, she grabbed another dress and commented, ""This cut doesn't do your figure any favors. Mrs. Fitzgerald should never look this basic.""
Emma stayed silent, doing whatever she was told like a lifeless puppet.
When they finally settled on a dress, Sophie dropped her fake act in the now-empty fitting room.
""So you're not truly distant—you're just playing hard to get.""
She gripped Emma's wrist hard, her nails digging in. ""Don't think you can just steal Cadoc from me. He's mine!""
Emma didn't react. She pulled her hand away without saying a word.
There was no act of playing hard to get, and she never meant to steal Cadoc away.
She wanted out of this mess more than anyone.
But Sophie was convinced Emma was trying to take Cadoc from her and started stirring up more drama.
On the eve of the wedding, Cadoc kicked Emma's door open.
""You locked Sophie in the fitting room?!"" he said gloomily, ""Do you know she has claustrophobia?!""
Emma shut her eyes tiredly. ""It wasn't me.""
""You're still denying it?"" he shouted, yanking her up. ""Looks like you haven't learned your lesson.""
Ignoring her protests, he told the bodyguards to throw her into a dark, musty basement.
In the pitch black, Emma curled up in the corner. Sometime after midnight, she heard faint noises.
Then, a bag of live rats had been tossed in.
She screamed, bolted upright, and started pounding on the door. Her nails tore, but no one answered her calls of agony.
The next morning, Cadoc opened the door coldly. ""It was just one night. Do you have to cry all night?""
After enduring a night of torment, Emma looked drained and pale. ""Sophie sent the rats in...""
Cadoc scoffed. ""Sophie would never do anything like that.""
He flipped on the light. ""Where are those rats then?""
Emma's eyes widened.
The basement was spotless—not a rat or even a trace left behind.
Sophie had erased all the proof.
Emma wanted to explain, but she gave up.
Cadoc's voice turned cold. ""The wedding is in three days. I'll be spending time with Sophie until then. I'll show up on that day.""
He shot her a warning glare. ""Don't do anything stvpid. Otherwise, the wedding is off.""

Chapter 8
Cadoc threw those words out coldly before turning and walking away.
His footsteps faded into the distance as Emma slowly pushed herself up, using the wall for support.
She shut herself away in her room for the next three days, barely stepping outside.
She barely touched the meals the maids brought her, just picking at a few bites. No matter how sunny it got, she refused to leave her room.
She didn't want to give Sophie another shot at setting her up.
Cadoc, like he promised, stayed with Sophie the entire time and didn't even come home.
Emma saw their outings all over the gossip sites.
Sophie clung to Cadoc's arm, flashing a sweet smile. And Cadoc? He looked down at her gently.
The day before the wedding, Emma sat at her desk, scribbling a list of everything Cadoc liked and couldn't stand.
""He hates cilantro and can't handle spicy food. He only drinks coffee without sugar. His shirts must be perfectly ironed. He needs pitch darkness to sleep...""
After writing, she folded the note neatly and called over the maid, Tiana Rivera.
""Hold on to this for me,"" she said softly. ""Give it back after the wedding.""
Tiana blinked in confusion. ""Mrs. Fitzgerald, what's this for?""
""In case I forget. "" Emma smiled slightly. ""You know how bad my memory has been lately.""
Tiana still looked puzzled, but she nodded and took the note. ""Alright, Mrs. Fitzgerald. I'll keep it safe.""
After Tiana left, Emma pulled out a suitcase she had packed days ago from the back of the closet.
She glanced around the room she'd called home for three years, her eyes pausing on the wedding photo on the wall.
Cadoc looked handsome in his suit, and she was in a stunning gown, smiling softly.
Emma took the photo down, laid it face down on the table, and walked out without looking back.
At the airport lobby, Zoey had been waiting.
She handed Emma a plane ticket and a bank card. ""That's five million. From now on, you have zero ties to the Jefferson family.""
Emma's fingers shook slightly as she accepted them.
When she looked up, Zoey wasn't even looking at her.
""Thanks,"" Emma said softly.
Zoey's tone stayed cold. ""You've done a good job in the past three years. The partnership between the families stayed intact.""
She paused before adding, ""Go live the life you want.""
Emma nodded, turned, and headed toward the security gate.
Before turning the corner, she took one last glance back. Zoey was already gone. Her figure looked so firm, like Emma had never been her daughter at all.
But Emma didn't feel broken. She held the plane ticket tightly, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.
This time, she could finally live for herself.
Without looking back, she walked straight toward the boarding gate.
At the Fitzgerald's villa, a woman who looked almost identical to Emma slipped into a wedding dress and sat quietly, waiting for the ceremony the next day.

1njza2e,https://i.redd.it/httxu56ptupf1.jpeg,A marriage made of lies free link please!!,"After pretending to be her sister and married with Cadoc for three years, Emma Jefferson can finally leave him now.
""Your sister will be back in a month. Until then, you have to keep pretending to be her,"" her mother, Zoey Jefferson, said coldly over the phone. ""Once that's done, I'll transfer five million to you. Then you're free to do whatever you want.""
""Okay,"" Emma replied softly, her voice calm.
After she hung up, she stared at the giant wedding photo on the wall.
Cadoc looked handsome in his suit, and she was in a stunning gown, smiling softly.
""It's been three years,"" she whispered, brushing her finger across the photo frame. ""It's finally over.""
Three years ago, the marriage between the Fitzgerald and the Jefferson families made headlines. Her twin sister, Ella Jefferson, had been chosen as the Fitzgerald family's future daughter-in-law.
But on the eve of the wedding, she left a note and vanished.
""Dad, Mom, I don't want to be tied down by marriage, but I know it's my duty. Just give me three years to live freely. I'll come back after that.""
To keep the deal between the two families alive, Zoey and her husband, Dylan Jefferson, had no choice but to bring Emma back—the twin daughter they'd left behind in the countryside since she was a kid.
Emma had never even been allowed at family events, but she became a substitute bride under Ella's name.
""Cadoc doesn't like your sister,"" Zoey said coldly the night before the wedding. ""He's hung up on a poor scholarship girl. Marrying him won't be easy, but just stay in line and get through these three years pretending to be Ella.""
Emma had only nodded back then.
Of course, she knew who Cadoc was. His face was always in finance magazines. He was the most prestigious nobleman among the elites, with socialites practically throwing themselves at him.
She had also heard the story about Sophie.
Sophie was a struggling student sponsored by the Fitzgerald family. She attended a top university on scholarship. Cadoc loved her deeply and wanted to be with her, even against his family's wishes. But Sophie, proud and distant, couldn't accept a relationship without anyone's approval, so she chose to end things and go overseas.
The Fitzgerald family was overjoyed and rushed to arrange Cadoc's marriage.
Married life turned out to be way harder than Emma thought.
Cadoc's study was covered in photos of Sophie. He flew to Paris every week just to see her secretly. Meanwhile, Emma wasn't even allowed to enter the main bedroom. She had to sleep in the guest room at the far end of the hallway.
She was cautious and tried her best to act like Ella. To make sure the partnership between their families' companies wouldn't fall apart, she did everything she could to stay on Cadoc's good side.
If he worked late, she'd leave the lights on and wait by the door. When his stomach acted up, she'd wake up at five every morning to make oatmeal. He liked a quiet house, so she stayed as silent as possible.
Eventually, people started saying she was crazy in love with him. But slowly, the way he looked at her began to shift.
The photos of Sophie vanished from his study. His Paris trips stopped. He started remembering Emma's birthday, came home early when she was sick, and even began sleeping with her.
Emma almost believed that genuine love had somehow come from that substitute marriage.
Then, three months ago, Sophie returned.
Everything flipped back.
Cadoc's attention was on Sophie again. He stopped coming home, and Sophie's photos were back in his study. People mocked Emma like she was some kind of joke. But she never made a scene. She just smiled.
The truth was—she never loved him.
She only stayed for the money and freedom her parents promised. If Cadoc had fallen for her, great. If not, she wouldn't care.
Nobody knew that Emma and Ella might have shared a face, but their lives were nothing alike.
Zoey nearly died giving birth to Emma. Since then, she looked at Emma with nothing but disgust. Dylan doted on Zoey so much that he treated Emma like a jinx.
At age five, Emma was shipped off to live with a nanny in the countryside.
She still remembered that one freezing winter. The heater broke, and she was shaking in the cold without even a proper coat. Meanwhile, Ella was snug in a fancy villa, wrapped in designer clothes, being showered in love.
After 18 years of being treated like she didn't matter, Emma had stopped expecting family affection.
With just a month left, she'd finally get the five million promised for pretending to be Ella. Then, she could leave this place and live life on her terms.
While she was in a good mood, her phone buzzed with a call.
It was Cadoc.
Emma took a breath and picked up. ""Hello?""
He hung up before she could respond. Emma stared at the phone, already knowing who they were for.
He said coldly, ""Bring sanitary pads to the Nightfall Club. Night ones. You've got 20 minutes.""
Outside, the rain was pouring. The drive from the Fitzgerald's villa to the Nightfall Club usually took at least 40 minutes.
Still, Emma grabbed an umbrella and left.
Traffic was awful. With just 12 minutes left, she checked the time, gritted her teeth, and jumped out of the car, running through the rain.
The rain quickly drenched her clothes, and her high heels kept slipping on the slick pavement. She lost her balance and crashed into a puddle, pain searing through her knees.
But she kept going. She finally made it to the club at the 19th minute.
Before knocking on the private room's door, she overheard people laughing inside.
""Mr. Fitzgerald, are you truly asking Ella to come out in this storm just to drop off pads? It'll take at least 40 minutes from your place.""
""Sophie is hurting,"" Cadoc replied indifferently, ""Ella will figure it out.""
""Well, that's right. Everyone knows how deeply Ella loves you. For the past three years, even though your heart belonged to someone else, she's stayed by your side without a single complaint.""
Someone teased, ""Come on, man. Are you sure you weren't tempted by that beauty who's been by your side all these years?""
There was silence. Emma held her breath.
After a pause, Cadoc said, ""Between Sophie and Ella, I'll always choose Sophie.""
His words didn't hurt. Instead, she felt relieved. She waited until the laughter stopped, then knocked on the door.
When she walked in, everyone looked stunned.
""Wow, right on time!""
""Ella, why are you drenched?""
Cadoc got up, frowning. ""Why are you in a mess?""
Emma handed over the well-protected pads. ""You said 20 minutes. I didn't want you to worry, so I ran the rest of the way.""
She didn't bring up the fall or the pain.
Cadoc's expression shifted slightly. He took off his suit jacket and draped it over her shoulders. ""Wear this.""
Then, he motioned toward the pads. ""Take those to the ladies' room.""
Emma nodded and walked off.
At the restroom, she knocked. A soft voice answered, ""Who is it?""
""I brought the pads.""
There was silence for a few seconds, then the door opened slightly. Emma handed them over without a word and left.
Back home, she took a hot bath. Her scraped knee stung.
Lying in bed, she finally felt at peace. Freedom was so close she could taste it.
But before she could sleep, the door burst open.
Cadoc stormed in, grabbed her wrist. ""Get up!""
Before Emma could react, he yanked her out of bed and dragged her toward the stairs.
""Cadoc? What are you—""
Before she could finish speaking, he shoved her hard, knocking her backward. The back of her head struck the step hard as she tumbled down the stairs.
Severe pain exploded through her whole body.
Lying at the bottom, she struggled to move. Her vision was fuzzy, blood trickling down her face.
""Why... Why are you doing this?!""
Cadoc stood above her, his face shadowed. His voice was chillingly cold.
""Did you push Sophie?""
Emma stared up, confused. ""What?""
""Drop the act!"" He stepped closer. ""You've been acting all generous just waiting for a chance, right? You shoved her out the window. She's broken all over and almost died!""
""I didn't..."" She shook her head weakly. The movement aggravated the wound on her head, making her feel lightheaded and dizzy.
Cadoc squatted down, grabbing her chin. ""Ella, have you started thinking I care about you? We're only married, not in love.""
He leaned in and emphasized, ""I'll never love you!""
Emma felt pain all over. But instead of crying, she almost laughed.
She never wanted his love in the first place.

Chapter 2
Emma was about to say something, but Cadoc yanked her up coldly.
""Cut the act,"" he said coldly. ""Sophie fell from the fifth floor. You only tumbled down from the second.
""Get up. We're going to the hospital—you're going to apologize.""
He dragged her out like he didn't even notice the blood still dripping from her forehead or how her injured knee was bleeding again. Every step she took felt like she was walking on knives.
He shoved her into the car, and neither of them said a word the entire ride.
Emma stared blankly out the window, watching the scenery go by. She told herself to hold on a little longer. Freedom was almost here.
At the hospital, Sophie sat propped up in bed, looking pale, her wrists covered in bandages.
The second she spotted Emma, she shrank back. Her eyes filled with tears.
""Cadoc..."" she whimpered, voice shaking. ""I-I don't want to see her...""
Cadoc rushed to her side, took her hand, and said softly, ""Don't worry. I'm here. No one is going to hurt you.""
Then, he turned to Emma, his expression hard. ""Why are you just standing there? Apologize.""
Emma looked exhausted, but her voice was calm.
She stared at Sophie and asked softly, ""Ms. Powell, are you truly saying I pushed you off that window?""
Sophie's lashes fluttered. Her eyes filled with tears again. ""Ms. Jefferson, if you're not willing to apologize, it's fine. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.""
She sniffled and looked pitiful. ""Cadoc has been staying by my side lately. I get why you hate me. But your marriage wasn't about love. If I came from the right kind of family, you wouldn't even be in the picture...""
Her crying got worse, and Cadoc's face got darker.
He interrupted sharply, ""Ella! I told you to apologize, not pick a fight! Are you gonna do it or not?""
Emma closed her eyes for a second. She knew Sophie was framing her, but she was leaving soon.
She couldn't afford any issues in the partnership between the two families. Otherwise, she'd lose the five million and her chance at freedom.
So, she just said, ""I'm sorry. I was wrong.""
Then, she turned to leave.
But Cadoc stopped her. ""Wait. Since you pushed her, you should stay and take care of her until she's out of the hospital.""
Emma's fingers twitched slightly, but she nodded. ""Alright.""
In the following days, Emma stayed quietly in Sophie's ward.
Cadoc practically moved into the hospital, ignoring work and feeding Sophie oatmeal, helping her wash up, and coaxing her to sleep.
He never did those for Emma.
But she never looked upset. She just took care of Sophie calmly, like it was just another chore.
The nurses whispered about it behind her back.
""Wow, I've never seen a wife this generous!""
""You don't get it. This is love at its most selfless."" Another nurse sighed. ""She's so in love with Mr. Fitzgerald that she's even willing to care for the woman he loves—just to get a little more of his attention. How pitiful.""
Cadoc happened to walk by and overheard.
He stopped in his tracks and glanced toward the ward.
Emma sat with her head down, carefully peeling an apple. Her profile looked calm and tender.
A strange feeling suddenly stirred in Cadoc's heart.
When the day finally came for Sophie to leave the hospital, Cadoc told Emma straight up, ""I'm taking Sophie on a trip. Don't contact me unless it's urgent.""
Emma nodded. ""Got it.""
She watched them walk away hand in hand and felt lighter.
Finally, she didn't have to deal with them anymore.
As soon as she got home, she began packing her luggage, getting ready to leave soon.
A few days later, she came across Sophie's latest Instagram post.
Cadoc had taken her to the Maldives. He'd made an unlimited bid for her at an auction and spent a fortune on her favorite jewelry.
Emma looked at it for a second, then just scrolled past.
She didn't care.
She never did.

Chapter 3
A week later, it was time for the Fitzgerald family's regular monthly dinner.
Since Cadoc wasn't around, Emma had to show up on her own.
When Cadoc's mother, Amanda Fitzgerald, saw Emma walk in, her expression darkened. ""Where's Cadoc?""
Emma kept her head down. ""He's busy with something. He couldn't make it back.""
Amanda sneered and was about to respond when the butler rushed over and handed her an entertainment newspaper.
The headline was a photo of Cadoc and Sophie kissing on a yacht.
Amanda slammed her fork down. ""Ella! Come with me now!""
She stormed off to the study. As soon as the door shut, she yelled, ""Get on your knees!""
Without saying a word, Emma dropped to her knees.
""You trash!"" Amanda was shaking with rage. ""You can't even keep your husband! You've got two choices—call him home now or take your punishment!""
Emma's lashes fluttered.
She knew that no matter how many times she called, Cadoc wouldn't show up.
He was probably wrapped up in a cozy getaway with Sophie. If she bothered him, the deal between their families could fall apart.
""I'll take the punishment,"" she said softly.
Amanda was pis-sed off. ""What did you just say?""
""I choose the punishment."" Emma raised her head calmly. ""Go ahead.""
Flushed with anger, Amanda grabbed the whip hanging on the wall and hit it hard on Emma's back.
""Still not calling him?""
Slap!
""How about now?!""
Slap!
Emma bit her lips tightly, pain searing through her body, but she only shook her head.
Eventually, she passed out.
When she woke up, she was lying in a hospital bed, her back wrapped in thick bandages.
Cadoc was sitting nearby, looking annoyed.
""My mom was giving you a hard time. Why didn't you just call me?"" he asked coldly.
Emma gave him a weak smile. ""I didn't want to ruin your date with Ms. Powell.""
He froze.
Her pale face reminded him of something the nurse had said.
""She's so in love with Mr. Fitzgerald that she's even willing to care for the woman he loves...""
Did she love him so deeply that she'd rather face punishment than bother him?
Cadoc felt an even deeper sense of unease growing in his heart.
For the next few days, he stayed at the hospital to look after her for the first time.
Emma didn't need his help, but he didn't leave.
It wasn't until the day she was being discharged from the hospital. Cadoc got a call about an urgent issue at the company. He had to attend a meeting.
""Go home on your own,"" he said as he turned and left.
Emma just nodded and slowly made her way out.
As she was walking down the stairs, she accidentally bumped into someone.
""Are you blind?!"" the man snapped. ""You know how much this outfit costs? With the way you're dressed, could you even pay for it?""
Before Emma could apologize, a sharp voice came from behind.
""Get lost!""
Cadoc had gotten out of the car. He pulled out a wad of cash and tossed it in that man's face. ""Is this enough?""
That man wanted to argue. But when he saw Cadoc's clothes and aura, he bolted in panic.
Cadoc turned to Emma coldly. ""Ella, don't our families give you money? Why are you dressed like this?""
She stayed quiet.
The Jefferson family never gave her money. Even though the Fitzgerald family gave her a black card, she wasn't the real Ella, so she never touched it.
Cadoc seemed annoyed by her silence and dragged her into the car.
""We're going shopping.""
At the mall, he picked out a bunch of designer outfits for her, each of which was expensive.
Emma didn't protest. She just quietly followed along like an emotionless puppet.
But as they were walking out of the mall, a shaky voice called out.
""Cadoc?""
Emma looked up and saw Sophie not far away, still dressed in a part-time waiter uniform. Her eyes were red and full of disbelief.
""You told me you had an emergency meeting at the office.""
""Sophie..."" Cadoc's expression changed slightly.
""It's fine if you don't love me."" Sophie's tears fell. ""But how could you lie to me? I should've never come back. I'm just in the way.""
She turned and ran.
""Sophie!"" Cadoc shouted and chased after her.
Emma stood still, quietly watching him go. She only felt calm.
But then—
Crash!
Glass from high above in the mall suddenly shattered and struck Sophie's head.
She collapsed into a pool of blood without even making a sound.

Chapter 4
Cadoc's face instantly changed. He sprinted over, scooped Sophie into his arms, and rushed off to the hospital without looking back.
Emma stood there, hands slowly curling into fists, then quietly followed behind.
Beneath the dim glow of the hospital corridor, the lights inside the operating room remained on.
Cadoc waited outside, blood still staining his suit. A trace of worry surfaced on his usually calm and collected face.
Emma sat nearby, not saying anything.
Suddenly, the door burst open, and a doctor stepped out in a rush. ""She's lost a lot of blood and needs a transfusion, but she's RH negative. We don't have any in stock!""
Cadoc frowned. He was about to say something when Emma stood up and said, ""I have Rh-negative blood. I can donate to her.""
He turned sharply toward her, clearly surprised.
Emma met his eyes calmly. ""Helping her matters more.""
She followed the nurse without hesitation. Blood slowly flowed from her arm, and her face turned pale, but she stayed steady.
Cadoc stood there, watching the needle in her arm, feeling a strange twist in his chest.
How much did she care about him?
After the donation, Emma walked out holding cotton to her arm. Cadoc was still planted by the operating room door.
She paused, then went over to him and whispered, ""Don't worry. She'll be fine.""
He looked over, voice a bit hoarse. ""Why don't you leave?""
Emma shook her head. ""Ms. Powell has the wrong idea about us. I want to clear it up when she wakes up.""
He stared at her pale face and suddenly asked, ""Do you like me that much?""
She froze.
Just as she was about to speak, the doctor came out of the operating room. ""She's stable. She'll regain consciousness once the anestthesia wears off.""
Cadoc's body finally relaxed.
Emma didn't say anything else. She just stepped back and stayed quiet.
A few hours passed, and Sophie opened her eyes.
As soon as she saw Emma by the bed, her eyes welled up. ""Cadoc, did you bring her here just so I could give you two my blessing?""
Emma quickly stepped forward. ""No, Ms. Powell. You've got it wrong. Cadoc did have a meeting. He just took me to buy some clothes on the way. It wasn't a date. He wasn't lying.""
Cadoc added, ""We're only married. There's no love between us.""
Sophie sniffled, biting her lip. ""How can you prove you don't have any feelings for her?""
He looked frustrated. ""What kind of proof are you looking for?""
She paused, then suddenly pointed out the window. ""Throw her into the frozen lake.""
His face tightened. ""Sophie...""
""You hesitated."" Her voice shook. ""You do like her.""
He went silent. Then, with a deep sigh, he turned and signaled the bodyguards. ""Throw her into the lake.""
Emma's eyes widened.
She already knew Cadoc would do anything for Sophie, but she didn't expect him to be so cruel.
Still, she couldn't resist. She had to take it.
The bodyguard dragged her away while Cadoc stood still, watching with a blank expression.
The lake was freezing.
The moment Emma was shoved down, she felt like she could barely breathe.
Water rushed into her nose and mouth. Her limbs quickly went numb.
She fought to stay afloat, but her body kept sinking.
The bodyguards on the shore just stared. Not a single one of them stepped in.
Her vision blurred. Everything started to fade. She thought she saw her younger self.
Left behind in the countryside by her parents, she had no warm clothes during the winter and trembled from the cold. Her only refuge was curling up in the woodshed at her nanny's house to stay warm.
No one ever cared about her.
Eventually, someone pulled her out of the lake.
Her body was freezing, her lips had turned pale, and she had slipped into unconsciousness.
In a trance, she felt someone gently wiping her body with a warm towel. The touch was gentle.
She instinctively grabbed the hand and whispered, ""Just a little longer... I can leave soon...""
Suddenly, someone gripped her so tightly that it hurt.
""What do you mean?!"" Cadoc's voice was trembling cold.

Chapter 5
Emma opened her eyes in pain and realized she was back at the Fitzgerald's villa.
Cadoc sat next to her bed, his face clouded. ""What did you mean earlier about leaving?""
Her heart gave a small jolt. She forced a dry laugh and played dumb. ""Huh? I don't even remember what I said. I probably had a fever and was rambling.""
He stared at her for a while before loosening his grip on her hand. ""You were in the lake for a long time. Why didn't you say you were on your period?""
Emma smiled weakly. ""If jumping into the lake made her forgive you, I'd rather not say it.""
His face twisted with a mix of emotions. ""You care that much about me?""
She looked down.
It wasn't about love.
She only wanted to keep the peace between the two families. Once Ella came back, she could leave.
Just then, the door flew open, and Sophie strolled in. ""Cadoc, when are we going fishing?""
Seeing Emma awake, she acted surprised. ""Ms. Jefferson, you're up! Feeling better?""
Before Emma could reply, Sophie kept talking. ""I kinda lost it the other day and told Cadoc to throw you in. I didn't expect that he would do that. I'm so sorry.
""I heard you donated blood to me. That was super generous. Let's go fishing together. My treat.""
Emma was about to decline, but Sophie was already grabbing her hand sweetly. ""Please don't say no. I already told Cadoc.""
Cadoc shot a glance at Emma, subtly signaling her not to ruin the mood.
So, she nodded reluctantly.
Out on the fancy yacht, the salty breeze blew gently.
Sophie clung to Cadoc the entire time, laughing as she got him to feed her fruit, put sunscreen on her back, and even asked him to carry her for a better view of the sea.
Emma stood on the deck, gazing out quietly at the horizon, like none of it involved her.
When Cadoc stepped away to take a phone call, Sophie walked over. ""I don't get you sometimes,"" she said out of nowhere.
Emma glanced over.
Sophie squinted. ""Everyone says you're head over heels for Cadoc and would do anything for him. But isn't loving someone about wanting him for yourself?
""I set you up and made you apologize—you didn't react. He tossed you into a frozen lake—and you still didn't react. Even now, I'm being intimate with him, but you don't even care.""
She stepped closer and lowered her voice. ""Do you even like him?""
Emma twitched her lips. Sophie had hit the nail on the head.
She didn't like Cadoc.
Before she could respond, a giant wave hit them.
""Ah!""
Both of them lost their balance and tumbled into the sea.
Cold seawater slammed over their heads. As they struggled, the metal edge of the yacht scraped deep cuts into their arms, leaving red trails behind in the water.
""Someone fell in! Get help!""
Panic broke out on deck. A rescuer jumped in but came back up quickly. He said seriously, ""Mr. Fitzgerald, their blood will attract sharks! They fell in different directions. We only have time to save one of them first!""
Cadoc's face went pale as his eyes darted across the waves.
Sophie thrashed in one direction, and Emma was drifting farther away the other way.
""Save Sophie first!"" he shouted.
Emma heard him. She coughed up seawater, gasping for air.
Through blurry eyes, she saw the rescue team swimming toward Sophie. She caught sight of the worry on Cadoc's face, gave a bitter smile, and slowly shut her eyes.
She should have known.
In his heart, she was always the extra—easy to throw away.
The seawater filled her lungs, and her consciousness gradually faded.
Before everything went black, she saw something dark swimming straight toward her.
It was a shark!
Then came the sharp, searing pain in her leg. The last thing she saw was the sea turning red.

Chapter 6
When Emma woke up, the first thing she saw was the white hospital ceiling above her.
""You're finally awake!"" the nurse said with relief. ""Your injuries are serious. We need to get in touch with your family right away.""
She paused for a second and sighed. ""Ms. Powell is next door. She also fell into the sea. She didn't get hurt as badly as you did, but Mr. Fitzgerald hasn't left her side. He treats her like she's priceless. Where's your family? It's been two days, and nobody has shown up.""
Emma stayed quiet, her lips pressed together.
Suddenly, the ward door flew open.
Cadoc stood there, his stare cold and sharp like a knife.
The nurse looked surprised to see him. But after a glance at his face, she quickly slipped out.
As soon as the door shut, Cadoc knocked over the medicine tray. Glass shattered loudly, and pills spilled everywhere.
""Did you push Sophie into the sea?"" His voice was cold.
Emma was stunned.
She had no idea why Sophie wanted to frame her. She felt nothing but exhaustion. ""No. I didn't.""
""Still lying?"" Cadoc snapped, gripping her wrist so tightly it hurt. ""Sophie told me everything herself! You used to be so generous—what changed?""
He sneered, like he understood something. ""Don't tell me all that tolerance before was just an act. Were you just trying to get my attention?""
Emma's face went pale from the pain, but she just looked at him without saying a word.
That only made him angrier.
He threw her hand aside violently. ""Fine. Since you won't admit what you did, you'll bear the fallout.""
He walked toward the door, his voice sharp and cold. ""No more nurses. No one is going to help you. Deal with your injuries on your own.""
The next few days were brutal.
No doctor came to check on her, and no nurse changed her bandages. She had to drag her battered body to the medicine cabinet and apply the treatment herself with shaking hands.
She fell to the ground multiple times, scraping and bruising her knees, but she kept pushing through and getting back up.
Cadoc probably thought that the eldest daughter of the Jefferson family couldn't handle such torture.
But he didn't know that she wasn't Ella. She wasn't a socialite who grew up in luxury.
She was Emma, who was raised in the countryside. She was abandoned by her parents at a young age and forced to face her illnesses all on her own.
That pain was nothing to her.
A few days later, Emma had just finished signing her discharge papers and was packing up her things when the door slammed open.
Cadoc barged in and yanked her wrist. ""Come with me.""
She frowned. ""What is it now?""
""Sophie was kidnapped by Levi,"" he said tensely, ""He's demanding you in exchange. He promised to let you go after three days.""
Emma froze.
Levi Ziegler was infamous for being a creep in their circle. Every time he looked at her, his cold stare felt clingy and revolting.
""I'm not going,"" she said firmly.
Cadoc's expression darkened. ""That's not your decision.""
Then, he suddenly softened his voice. ""He's obsessed with you. He won't hurt you. As long as you do what he says, I'll agree to whatever you want afterward.""
Emma stared at him, then gave a small smile. ""Alright. I want a wedding.""
Cadoc was startled. ""What?""
""We only got the marriage certificates. I want a real ceremony,"" she said softly, ""Make up for what I never had.""
That was part of her plan.
When Ella returned, a grand wedding would prove she was Cadoc's legal wife.
Cadoc was silent for a while, then gave a short nod. ""Fine. I promise you.""
When Emma arrived at the Ziegler's villa, Levi was lounging on the couch, grinning at her.
""It's been a while, Mrs. Fitzgerald.""
He ran a finger along her face. Though she felt sick, she kept her cool and didn't move away.
The first two days of torment were relatively mild. Levi simply had people take her blood, one vial after another.
She got used to the feeling of needles. But watching her blood fill those tubes made her stomach turn.
Then came the third day. Half-asleep, she overheard the bodyguards talking outside.
""Has Mr. Ziegler lost it? Is he truly planning to turn her into a specimen?""
""He said she's so beautiful that she should be preserved forever if she dies.""
Emma's blood ran cold.
Cadoc promised she'd be safe. Instead, she was going to die here.
A chill crept through her whole body. She bit her lip until she tasted blood just to stop herself from shaking.
Seizing a moment of the bodyguards' carelessness, she grabbed a crystal ornament from the bedside and hurled it at the window.
Crash!
Glass shards went flying. She picked up a shard, cut herself free, and jumped from the second story. A sharp snap came from her ankle as she hit the ground.
Pain shot through her leg, but she didn't stop.
With a sprained ankle, she limped out of the Ziegler's villa and made her way back to the Fitzgerald's villa.
As she stepped into the living room, she saw Cadoc down on one knee, gently tending to Sophie's ankle with medication.
""Cadoc..."" Sophie's eyes were red. ""Ms. Jefferson has been gone this long. Are you not worried at all?""
Cadoc froze for a second. Then, he spoke softly, ""I only care about you. Why didn't you tell me you were hurt? You know that breaks my heart.""
Emma stood soaking wet in the doorway, her ankle swollen and throbbing, but he didn't even notice.
She walked past them blankly.
""Ella?"" Cadoc finally looked up and jumped to his feet. ""You—""

Chapter 7
Cadoc gave her a once-over, checking if she was hurt. When he saw she was fine, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. ""What happened these last three days?""
Emma smiled bitterly, her lips cracked and bleeding. ""Nothing.""
She didn't waste time and asked, ""When will you hold the wedding you promised me?""
Sophie snapped her head up. ""What wedding?""
Cadoc paused before answering, ""We're having a ceremony.""
Seeing Sophie's eyes go red, he immediately explained, ""It's just a ceremony, Sophie. I only care about you.""
She forced a smile. ""I get it. I'm not upset. You're just trying to save me.""
Then, she turned to Emma and smiled sweetly. ""Ms. Jefferson, how about I help you pick out the perfect wedding dress?""
Over the next few days, Sophie stuck to Emma like glue as she tried on wedding dresses.
At the bridal boutique, Emma stood in front of the mirror wearing a white wedding dress that hugged her waist nicely. Sophie stayed close, inspecting every dress and nitpicking every little thing.
""This one's neckline is way too low,"" Sophie said, tugging at the fabric near Emma's collar. ""Change to something more conservative.""
Then, she grabbed another dress and commented, ""This cut doesn't do your figure any favors. Mrs. Fitzgerald should never look this basic.""
Emma stayed silent, doing whatever she was told like a lifeless puppet.
When they finally settled on a dress, Sophie dropped her fake act in the now-empty fitting room.
""So you're not truly distant—you're just playing hard to get.""
She gripped Emma's wrist hard, her nails digging in. ""Don't think you can just steal Cadoc from me. He's mine!""
Emma didn't react. She pulled her hand away without saying a word.
There was no act of playing hard to get, and she never meant to steal Cadoc away.
She wanted out of this mess more than anyone.
But Sophie was convinced Emma was trying to take Cadoc from her and started stirring up more drama.
On the eve of the wedding, Cadoc kicked Emma's door open.
""You locked Sophie in the fitting room?!"" he said gloomily, ""Do you know she has claustrophobia?!""
Emma shut her eyes tiredly. ""It wasn't me.""
""You're still denying it?"" he shouted, yanking her up. ""Looks like you haven't learned your lesson.""
Ignoring her protests, he told the bodyguards to throw her into a dark, musty basement.
In the pitch black, Emma curled up in the corner. Sometime after midnight, she heard faint noises.
Then, a bag of live rats had been tossed in.
She screamed, bolted upright, and started pounding on the door. Her nails tore, but no one answered her calls of agony.
The next morning, Cadoc opened the door coldly. ""It was just one night. Do you have to cry all night?""
After enduring a night of torment, Emma looked drained and pale. ""Sophie sent the rats in...""
Cadoc scoffed. ""Sophie would never do anything like that.""
He flipped on the light. ""Where are those rats then?""
Emma's eyes widened.
The basement was spotless—not a rat or even a trace left behind.
Sophie had erased all the proof.
Emma wanted to explain, but she gave up.
Cadoc's voice turned cold. ""The wedding is in three days. I'll be spending time with Sophie until then. I'll show up on that day.""
He shot her a warning glare. ""Don't do anything stvpid. Otherwise, the wedding is off.""

Chapter 8
Cadoc threw those words out coldly before turning and walking away.
His footsteps faded into the distance as Emma slowly pushed herself up, using the wall for support.
She shut herself away in her room for the next three days, barely stepping outside.
She barely touched the meals the maids brought her, just picking at a few bites. No matter how sunny it got, she refused to leave her room.
She didn't want to give Sophie another shot at setting her up.
Cadoc, like he promised, stayed with Sophie the entire time and didn't even come home.
Emma saw their outings all over the gossip sites.
Sophie clung to Cadoc's arm, flashing a sweet smile. And Cadoc? He looked down at her gently.
The day before the wedding, Emma sat at her desk, scribbling a list of everything Cadoc liked and couldn't stand.
""He hates cilantro and can't handle spicy food. He only drinks coffee without sugar. His shirts must be perfectly ironed. He needs pitch darkness to sleep...""
After writing, she folded the note neatly and called over the maid, Tiana Rivera.
""Hold on to this for me,"" she said softly. ""Give it back after the wedding.""
Tiana blinked in confusion. ""Mrs. Fitzgerald, what's this for?""
""In case I forget. "" Emma smiled slightly. ""You know how bad my memory has been lately.""
Tiana still looked puzzled, but she nodded and took the note. ""Alright, Mrs. Fitzgerald. I'll keep it safe.""
After Tiana left, Emma pulled out a suitcase she had packed days ago from the back of the closet.
She glanced around the room she'd called home for three years, her eyes pausing on the wedding photo on the wall.
Cadoc looked handsome in his suit, and she was in a stunning gown, smiling softly.
Emma took the photo down, laid it face down on the table, and walked out without looking back.
At the airport lobby, Zoey had been waiting.
She handed Emma a plane ticket and a bank card. ""That's five million. From now on, you have zero ties to the Jefferson family.""
Emma's fingers shook slightly as she accepted them.
When she looked up, Zoey wasn't even looking at her.
""Thanks,"" Emma said softly.
Zoey's tone stayed cold. ""You've done a good job in the past three years. The partnership between the families stayed intact.""
She paused before adding, ""Go live the life you want.""
Emma nodded, turned, and headed toward the security gate.
Before turning the corner, she took one last glance back. Zoey was already gone. Her figure looked so firm, like Emma had never been her daughter at all.
But Emma didn't feel broken. She held the plane ticket tightly, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.
This time, she could finally live for herself.
Without looking back, she walked straight toward the boarding gate.
At the Fitzgerald's villa, a woman who looked almost identical to Emma slipped into a wedding dress and sat quietly, waiting for the ceremony the next day.
Ella had returned.",3,1758171218.0,romancenovels,3,1.0,False
1njz9kp,https://i.redd.it/pmdaii6ktupf1.jpeg,A marriage made of lies free link please,"After pretending to be her sister and married with Cadoc for three years, Emma Jefferson can finally leave him now.
""Your sister will be back in a month. Until then, you have to keep pretending to be her,"" her mother, Zoey Jefferson, said coldly over the phone. ""Once that's done, I'll transfer five million to you. Then you're free to do whatever you want.""
""Okay,"" Emma replied softly, her voice calm.
After she hung up, she stared at the giant wedding photo on the wall.
Cadoc looked handsome in his suit, and she was in a stunning gown, smiling softly.
""It's been three years,"" she whispered, brushing her finger across the photo frame. ""It's finally over.""
Three years ago, the marriage between the Fitzgerald and the Jefferson families made headlines. Her twin sister, Ella Jefferson, had been chosen as the Fitzgerald family's future daughter-in-law.
But on the eve of the wedding, she left a note and vanished.
""Dad, Mom, I don't want to be tied down by marriage, but I know it's my duty. Just give me three years to live freely. I'll come back after that.""
To keep the deal between the two families alive, Zoey and her husband, Dylan Jefferson, had no choice but to bring Emma back—the twin daughter they'd left behind in the countryside since she was a kid.
Emma had never even been allowed at family events, but she became a substitute bride under Ella's name.
""Cadoc doesn't like your sister,"" Zoey said coldly the night before the wedding. ""He's hung up on a poor scholarship girl. Marrying him won't be easy, but just stay in line and get through these three years pretending to be Ella.""
Emma had only nodded back then.
Of course, she knew who Cadoc was. His face was always in finance magazines. He was the most prestigious nobleman among the elites, with socialites practically throwing themselves at him.
She had also heard the story about Sophie.
Sophie was a struggling student sponsored by the Fitzgerald family. She attended a top university on scholarship. Cadoc loved her deeply and wanted to be with her, even against his family's wishes. But Sophie, proud and distant, couldn't accept a relationship without anyone's approval, so she chose to end things and go overseas.
The Fitzgerald family was overjoyed and rushed to arrange Cadoc's marriage.
Married life turned out to be way harder than Emma thought.
Cadoc's study was covered in photos of Sophie. He flew to Paris every week just to see her secretly. Meanwhile, Emma wasn't even allowed to enter the main bedroom. She had to sleep in the guest room at the far end of the hallway.
She was cautious and tried her best to act like Ella. To make sure the partnership between their families' companies wouldn't fall apart, she did everything she could to stay on Cadoc's good side.
If he worked late, she'd leave the lights on and wait by the door. When his stomach acted up, she'd wake up at five every morning to make oatmeal. He liked a quiet house, so she stayed as silent as possible.
Eventually, people started saying she was crazy in love with him. But slowly, the way he looked at her began to shift.
The photos of Sophie vanished from his study. His Paris trips stopped. He started remembering Emma's birthday, came home early when she was sick, and even began sleeping with her.
Emma almost believed that genuine love had somehow come from that substitute marriage.
Then, three months ago, Sophie returned.
Everything flipped back.
Cadoc's attention was on Sophie again. He stopped coming home, and Sophie's photos were back in his study. People mocked Emma like she was some kind of joke. But she never made a scene. She just smiled.
The truth was—she never loved him.
She only stayed for the money and freedom her parents promised. If Cadoc had fallen for her, great. If not, she wouldn't care.
Nobody knew that Emma and Ella might have shared a face, but their lives were nothing alike.
Zoey nearly died giving birth to Emma. Since then, she looked at Emma with nothing but disgust. Dylan doted on Zoey so much that he treated Emma like a jinx.
At age five, Emma was shipped off to live with a nanny in the countryside.
She still remembered that one freezing winter. The heater broke, and she was shaking in the cold without even a proper coat. Meanwhile, Ella was snug in a fancy villa, wrapped in designer clothes, being showered in love.
After 18 years of being treated like she didn't matter, Emma had stopped expecting family affection.
With just a month left, she'd finally get the five million promised for pretending to be Ella. Then, she could leave this place and live life on her terms.
While she was in a good mood, her phone buzzed with a call.
It was Cadoc.
Emma took a breath and picked up. ""Hello?""
He hung up before she could respond. Emma stared at the phone, already knowing who they were for.
He said coldly, ""Bring sanitary pads to the Nightfall Club. Night ones. You've got 20 minutes.""
Outside, the rain was pouring. The drive from the Fitzgerald's villa to the Nightfall Club usually took at least 40 minutes.
Still, Emma grabbed an umbrella and left.
Traffic was awful. With just 12 minutes left, she checked the time, gritted her teeth, and jumped out of the car, running through the rain.
The rain quickly drenched her clothes, and her high heels kept slipping on the slick pavement. She lost her balance and crashed into a puddle, pain searing through her knees.
But she kept going. She finally made it to the club at the 19th minute.
Before knocking on the private room's door, she overheard people laughing inside.
""Mr. Fitzgerald, are you truly asking Ella to come out in this storm just to drop off pads? It'll take at least 40 minutes from your place.""
""Sophie is hurting,"" Cadoc replied indifferently, ""Ella will figure it out.""
""Well, that's right. Everyone knows how deeply Ella loves you. For the past three years, even though your heart belonged to someone else, she's stayed by your side without a single complaint.""
Someone teased, ""Come on, man. Are you sure you weren't tempted by that beauty who's been by your side all these years?""
There was silence. Emma held her breath.
After a pause, Cadoc said, ""Between Sophie and Ella, I'll always choose Sophie.""
His words didn't hurt. Instead, she felt relieved. She waited until the laughter stopped, then knocked on the door.
When she walked in, everyone looked stunned.
""Wow, right on time!""
""Ella, why are you drenched?""
Cadoc got up, frowning. ""Why are you in a mess?""
Emma handed over the well-protected pads. ""You said 20 minutes. I didn't want you to worry, so I ran the rest of the way.""
She didn't bring up the fall or the pain.
Cadoc's expression shifted slightly. He took off his suit jacket and draped it over her shoulders. ""Wear this.""
Then, he motioned toward the pads. ""Take those to the ladies' room.""
Emma nodded and walked off.
At the restroom, she knocked. A soft voice answered, ""Who is it?""
""I brought the pads.""
There was silence for a few seconds, then the door opened slightly. Emma handed them over without a word and left.
Back home, she took a hot bath. Her scraped knee stung.
Lying in bed, she finally felt at peace. Freedom was so close she could taste it.
But before she could sleep, the door burst open.
Cadoc stormed in, grabbed her wrist. ""Get up!""
Before Emma could react, he yanked her out of bed and dragged her toward the stairs.
""Cadoc? What are you—""
Before she could finish speaking, he shoved her hard, knocking her backward. The back of her head struck the step hard as she tumbled down the stairs.
Severe pain exploded through her whole body.
Lying at the bottom, she struggled to move. Her vision was fuzzy, blood trickling down her face.
""Why... Why are you doing this?!""
Cadoc stood above her, his face shadowed. His voice was chillingly cold.
""Did you push Sophie?""
Emma stared up, confused. ""What?""
""Drop the act!"" He stepped closer. ""You've been acting all generous just waiting for a chance, right? You shoved her out the window. She's broken all over and almost died!""
""I didn't..."" She shook her head weakly. The movement aggravated the wound on her head, making her feel lightheaded and dizzy.
Cadoc squatted down, grabbing her chin. ""Ella, have you started thinking I care about you? We're only married, not in love.""
He leaned in and emphasized, ""I'll never love you!""
Emma felt pain all over. But instead of crying, she almost laughed.
She never wanted his love in the first place.

Chapter 2
Emma was about to say something, but Cadoc yanked her up coldly.
""Cut the act,"" he said coldly. ""Sophie fell from the fifth floor. You only tumbled down from the second.
""Get up. We're going to the hospital—you're going to apologize.""
He dragged her out like he didn't even notice the blood still dripping from her forehead or how her injured knee was bleeding again. Every step she took felt like she was walking on knives.
He shoved her into the car, and neither of them said a word the entire ride.
Emma stared blankly out the window, watching the scenery go by. She told herself to hold on a little longer. Freedom was almost here.
At the hospital, Sophie sat propped up in bed, looking pale, her wrists covered in bandages.
The second she spotted Emma, she shrank back. Her eyes filled with tears.
""Cadoc..."" she whimpered, voice shaking. ""I-I don't want to see her...""
Cadoc rushed to her side, took her hand, and said softly, ""Don't worry. I'm here. No one is going to hurt you.""
Then, he turned to Emma, his expression hard. ""Why are you just standing there? Apologize.""
Emma looked exhausted, but her voice was calm.
She stared at Sophie and asked softly, ""Ms. Powell, are you truly saying I pushed you off that window?""
Sophie's lashes fluttered. Her eyes filled with tears again. ""Ms. Jefferson, if you're not willing to apologize, it's fine. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it.""
She sniffled and looked pitiful. ""Cadoc has been staying by my side lately. I get why you hate me. But your marriage wasn't about love. If I came from the right kind of family, you wouldn't even be in the picture...""
Her crying got worse, and Cadoc's face got darker.
He interrupted sharply, ""Ella! I told you to apologize, not pick a fight! Are you gonna do it or not?""
Emma closed her eyes for a second. She knew Sophie was framing her, but she was leaving soon.
She couldn't afford any issues in the partnership between the two families. Otherwise, she'd lose the five million and her chance at freedom.
So, she just said, ""I'm sorry. I was wrong.""
Then, she turned to leave.
But Cadoc stopped her. ""Wait. Since you pushed her, you should stay and take care of her until she's out of the hospital.""
Emma's fingers twitched slightly, but she nodded. ""Alright.""
In the following days, Emma stayed quietly in Sophie's ward.
Cadoc practically moved into the hospital, ignoring work and feeding Sophie oatmeal, helping her wash up, and coaxing her to sleep.
He never did those for Emma.
But she never looked upset. She just took care of Sophie calmly, like it was just another chore.
The nurses whispered about it behind her back.
""Wow, I've never seen a wife this generous!""
""You don't get it. This is love at its most selfless."" Another nurse sighed. ""She's so in love with Mr. Fitzgerald that she's even willing to care for the woman he loves—just to get a little more of his attention. How pitiful.""
Cadoc happened to walk by and overheard.
He stopped in his tracks and glanced toward the ward.
Emma sat with her head down, carefully peeling an apple. Her profile looked calm and tender.
A strange feeling suddenly stirred in Cadoc's heart.
When the day finally came for Sophie to leave the hospital, Cadoc told Emma straight up, ""I'm taking Sophie on a trip. Don't contact me unless it's urgent.""
Emma nodded. ""Got it.""
She watched them walk away hand in hand and felt lighter.
Finally, she didn't have to deal with them anymore.
As soon as she got home, she began packing her luggage, getting ready to leave soon.
A few days later, she came across Sophie's latest Instagram post.
Cadoc had taken her to the Maldives. He'd made an unlimited bid for her at an auction and spent a fortune on her favorite jewelry.
Emma looked at it for a second, then just scrolled past.
She didn't care.
She never did.

Chapter 3
A week later, it was time for the Fitzgerald family's regular monthly dinner.
Since Cadoc wasn't around, Emma had to show up on her own.
When Cadoc's mother, Amanda Fitzgerald, saw Emma walk in, her expression darkened. ""Where's Cadoc?""
Emma kept her head down. ""He's busy with something. He couldn't make it back.""
Amanda sneered and was about to respond when the butler rushed over and handed her an entertainment newspaper.
The headline was a photo of Cadoc and Sophie kissing on a yacht.
Amanda slammed her fork down. ""Ella! Come with me now!""
She stormed off to the study. As soon as the door shut, she yelled, ""Get on your knees!""
Without saying a word, Emma dropped to her knees.
""You trash!"" Amanda was shaking with rage. ""You can't even keep your husband! You've got two choices—call him home now or take your punishment!""
Emma's lashes fluttered.
She knew that no matter how many times she called, Cadoc wouldn't show up.
He was probably wrapped up in a cozy getaway with Sophie. If she bothered him, the deal between their families could fall apart.
""I'll take the punishment,"" she said softly.
Amanda was pis-sed off. ""What did you just say?""
""I choose the punishment."" Emma raised her head calmly. ""Go ahead.""
Flushed with anger, Amanda grabbed the whip hanging on the wall and hit it hard on Emma's back.
""Still not calling him?""
Slap!
""How about now?!""
Slap!
Emma bit her lips tightly, pain searing through her body, but she only shook her head.
Eventually, she passed out.
When she woke up, she was lying in a hospital bed, her back wrapped in thick bandages.
Cadoc was sitting nearby, looking annoyed.
""My mom was giving you a hard time. Why didn't you just call me?"" he asked coldly.
Emma gave him a weak smile. ""I didn't want to ruin your date with Ms. Powell.""
He froze.
Her pale face reminded him of something the nurse had said.
""She's so in love with Mr. Fitzgerald that she's even willing to care for the woman he loves...""
Did she love him so deeply that she'd rather face punishment than bother him?
Cadoc felt an even deeper sense of unease growing in his heart.
For the next few days, he stayed at the hospital to look after her for the first time.
Emma didn't need his help, but he didn't leave.
It wasn't until the day she was being discharged from the hospital. Cadoc got a call about an urgent issue at the company. He had to attend a meeting.
""Go home on your own,"" he said as he turned and left.
Emma just nodded and slowly made her way out.
As she was walking down the stairs, she accidentally bumped into someone.
""Are you blind?!"" the man snapped. ""You know how much this outfit costs? With the way you're dressed, could you even pay for it?""
Before Emma could apologize, a sharp voice came from behind.
""Get lost!""
Cadoc had gotten out of the car. He pulled out a wad of cash and tossed it in that man's face. ""Is this enough?""
That man wanted to argue. But when he saw Cadoc's clothes and aura, he bolted in panic.
Cadoc turned to Emma coldly. ""Ella, don't our families give you money? Why are you dressed like this?""
She stayed quiet.
The Jefferson family never gave her money. Even though the Fitzgerald family gave her a black card, she wasn't the real Ella, so she never touched it.
Cadoc seemed annoyed by her silence and dragged her into the car.
""We're going shopping.""
At the mall, he picked out a bunch of designer outfits for her, each of which was expensive.
Emma didn't protest. She just quietly followed along like an emotionless puppet.
But as they were walking out of the mall, a shaky voice called out.
""Cadoc?""
Emma looked up and saw Sophie not far away, still dressed in a part-time waiter uniform. Her eyes were red and full of disbelief.
""You told me you had an emergency meeting at the office.""
""Sophie..."" Cadoc's expression changed slightly.
""It's fine if you don't love me."" Sophie's tears fell. ""But how could you lie to me? I should've never come back. I'm just in the way.""
She turned and ran.
""Sophie!"" Cadoc shouted and chased after her.
Emma stood still, quietly watching him go. She only felt calm.
But then—
Crash!
Glass from high above in the mall suddenly shattered and struck Sophie's head.
She collapsed into a pool of blood without even making a sound.

Chapter 4
Cadoc's face instantly changed. He sprinted over, scooped Sophie into his arms, and rushed off to the hospital without looking back.
Emma stood there, hands slowly curling into fists, then quietly followed behind.
Beneath the dim glow of the hospital corridor, the lights inside the operating room remained on.
Cadoc waited outside, blood still staining his suit. A trace of worry surfaced on his usually calm and collected face.
Emma sat nearby, not saying anything.
Suddenly, the door burst open, and a doctor stepped out in a rush. ""She's lost a lot of blood and needs a transfusion, but she's RH negative. We don't have any in stock!""
Cadoc frowned. He was about to say something when Emma stood up and said, ""I have Rh-negative blood. I can donate to her.""
He turned sharply toward her, clearly surprised.
Emma met his eyes calmly. ""Helping her matters more.""
She followed the nurse without hesitation. Blood slowly flowed from her arm, and her face turned pale, but she stayed steady.
Cadoc stood there, watching the needle in her arm, feeling a strange twist in his chest.
How much did she care about him?
After the donation, Emma walked out holding cotton to her arm. Cadoc was still planted by the operating room door.
She paused, then went over to him and whispered, ""Don't worry. She'll be fine.""
He looked over, voice a bit hoarse. ""Why don't you leave?""
Emma shook her head. ""Ms. Powell has the wrong idea about us. I want to clear it up when she wakes up.""
He stared at her pale face and suddenly asked, ""Do you like me that much?""
She froze.
Just as she was about to speak, the doctor came out of the operating room. ""She's stable. She'll regain consciousness once the anestthesia wears off.""
Cadoc's body finally relaxed.
Emma didn't say anything else. She just stepped back and stayed quiet.
A few hours passed, and Sophie opened her eyes.
As soon as she saw Emma by the bed, her eyes welled up. ""Cadoc, did you bring her here just so I could give you two my blessing?""
Emma quickly stepped forward. ""No, Ms. Powell. You've got it wrong. Cadoc did have a meeting. He just took me to buy some clothes on the way. It wasn't a date. He wasn't lying.""
Cadoc added, ""We're only married. There's no love between us.""
Sophie sniffled, biting her lip. ""How can you prove you don't have any feelings for her?""
He looked frustrated. ""What kind of proof are you looking for?""
She paused, then suddenly pointed out the window. ""Throw her into the frozen lake.""
His face tightened. ""Sophie...""
""You hesitated."" Her voice shook. ""You do like her.""
He went silent. Then, with a deep sigh, he turned and signaled the bodyguards. ""Throw her into the lake.""
Emma's eyes widened.
She already knew Cadoc would do anything for Sophie, but she didn't expect him to be so cruel.
Still, she couldn't resist. She had to take it.
The bodyguard dragged her away while Cadoc stood still, watching with a blank expression.
The lake was freezing.
The moment Emma was shoved down, she felt like she could barely breathe.
Water rushed into her nose and mouth. Her limbs quickly went numb.
She fought to stay afloat, but her body kept sinking.
The bodyguards on the shore just stared. Not a single one of them stepped in.
Her vision blurred. Everything started to fade. She thought she saw her younger self.
Left behind in the countryside by her parents, she had no warm clothes during the winter and trembled from the cold. Her only refuge was curling up in the woodshed at her nanny's house to stay warm.
No one ever cared about her.
Eventually, someone pulled her out of the lake.
Her body was freezing, her lips had turned pale, and she had slipped into unconsciousness.
In a trance, she felt someone gently wiping her body with a warm towel. The touch was gentle.
She instinctively grabbed the hand and whispered, ""Just a little longer... I can leave soon...""
Suddenly, someone gripped her so tightly that it hurt.
""What do you mean?!"" Cadoc's voice was trembling cold.

Chapter 5
Emma opened her eyes in pain and realized she was back at the Fitzgerald's villa.
Cadoc sat next to her bed, his face clouded. ""What did you mean earlier about leaving?""
Her heart gave a small jolt. She forced a dry laugh and played dumb. ""Huh? I don't even remember what I said. I probably had a fever and was rambling.""
He stared at her for a while before loosening his grip on her hand. ""You were in the lake for a long time. Why didn't you say you were on your period?""
Emma smiled weakly. ""If jumping into the lake made her forgive you, I'd rather not say it.""
His face twisted with a mix of emotions. ""You care that much about me?""
She looked down.
It wasn't about love.
She only wanted to keep the peace between the two families. Once Ella came back, she could leave.
Just then, the door flew open, and Sophie strolled in. ""Cadoc, when are we going fishing?""
Seeing Emma awake, she acted surprised. ""Ms. Jefferson, you're up! Feeling better?""
Before Emma could reply, Sophie kept talking. ""I kinda lost it the other day and told Cadoc to throw you in. I didn't expect that he would do that. I'm so sorry.
""I heard you donated blood to me. That was super generous. Let's go fishing together. My treat.""
Emma was about to decline, but Sophie was already grabbing her hand sweetly. ""Please don't say no. I already told Cadoc.""
Cadoc shot a glance at Emma, subtly signaling her not to ruin the mood.
So, she nodded reluctantly.
Out on the fancy yacht, the salty breeze blew gently.
Sophie clung to Cadoc the entire time, laughing as she got him to feed her fruit, put sunscreen on her back, and even asked him to carry her for a better view of the sea.
Emma stood on the deck, gazing out quietly at the horizon, like none of it involved her.
When Cadoc stepped away to take a phone call, Sophie walked over. ""I don't get you sometimes,"" she said out of nowhere.
Emma glanced over.
Sophie squinted. ""Everyone says you're head over heels for Cadoc and would do anything for him. But isn't loving someone about wanting him for yourself?
""I set you up and made you apologize—you didn't react. He tossed you into a frozen lake—and you still didn't react. Even now, I'm being intimate with him, but you don't even care.""
She stepped closer and lowered her voice. ""Do you even like him?""
Emma twitched her lips. Sophie had hit the nail on the head.
She didn't like Cadoc.
Before she could respond, a giant wave hit them.
""Ah!""
Both of them lost their balance and tumbled into the sea.
Cold seawater slammed over their heads. As they struggled, the metal edge of the yacht scraped deep cuts into their arms, leaving red trails behind in the water.
""Someone fell in! Get help!""
Panic broke out on deck. A rescuer jumped in but came back up quickly. He said seriously, ""Mr. Fitzgerald, their blood will attract sharks! They fell in different directions. We only have time to save one of them first!""
Cadoc's face went pale as his eyes darted across the waves.
Sophie thrashed in one direction, and Emma was drifting farther away the other way.
""Save Sophie first!"" he shouted.
Emma heard him. She coughed up seawater, gasping for air.
Through blurry eyes, she saw the rescue team swimming toward Sophie. She caught sight of the worry on Cadoc's face, gave a bitter smile, and slowly shut her eyes.
She should have known.
In his heart, she was always the extra—easy to throw away.
The seawater filled her lungs, and her consciousness gradually faded.
Before everything went black, she saw something dark swimming straight toward her.
It was a shark!
Then came the sharp, searing pain in her leg. The last thing she saw was the sea turning red.

Chapter 6
When Emma woke up, the first thing she saw was the white hospital ceiling above her.
""You're finally awake!"" the nurse said with relief. ""Your injuries are serious. We need to get in touch with your family right away.""
She paused for a second and sighed. ""Ms. Powell is next door. She also fell into the sea. She didn't get hurt as badly as you did, but Mr. Fitzgerald hasn't left her side. He treats her like she's priceless. Where's your family? It's been two days, and nobody has shown up.""
Emma stayed quiet, her lips pressed together.
Suddenly, the ward door flew open.
Cadoc stood there, his stare cold and sharp like a knife.
The nurse looked surprised to see him. But after a glance at his face, she quickly slipped out.
As soon as the door shut, Cadoc knocked over the medicine tray. Glass shattered loudly, and pills spilled everywhere.
""Did you push Sophie into the sea?"" His voice was cold.
Emma was stunned.
She had no idea why Sophie wanted to frame her. She felt nothing but exhaustion. ""No. I didn't.""
""Still lying?"" Cadoc snapped, gripping her wrist so tightly it hurt. ""Sophie told me everything herself! You used to be so generous—what changed?""
He sneered, like he understood something. ""Don't tell me all that tolerance before was just an act. Were you just trying to get my attention?""
Emma's face went pale from the pain, but she just looked at him without saying a word.
That only made him angrier.
He threw her hand aside violently. ""Fine. Since you won't admit what you did, you'll bear the fallout.""
He walked toward the door, his voice sharp and cold. ""No more nurses. No one is going to help you. Deal with your injuries on your own.""
The next few days were brutal.
No doctor came to check on her, and no nurse changed her bandages. She had to drag her battered body to the medicine cabinet and apply the treatment herself with shaking hands.
She fell to the ground multiple times, scraping and bruising her knees, but she kept pushing through and getting back up.
Cadoc probably thought that the eldest daughter of the Jefferson family couldn't handle such torture.
But he didn't know that she wasn't Ella. She wasn't a socialite who grew up in luxury.
She was Emma, who was raised in the countryside. She was abandoned by her parents at a young age and forced to face her illnesses all on her own.
That pain was nothing to her.
A few days later, Emma had just finished signing her discharge papers and was packing up her things when the door slammed open.
Cadoc barged in and yanked her wrist. ""Come with me.""
She frowned. ""What is it now?""
""Sophie was kidnapped by Levi,"" he said tensely, ""He's demanding you in exchange. He promised to let you go after three days.""
Emma froze.
Levi Ziegler was infamous for being a creep in their circle. Every time he looked at her, his cold stare felt clingy and revolting.
""I'm not going,"" she said firmly.
Cadoc's expression darkened. ""That's not your decision.""
Then, he suddenly softened his voice. ""He's obsessed with you. He won't hurt you. As long as you do what he says, I'll agree to whatever you want afterward.""
Emma stared at him, then gave a small smile. ""Alright. I want a wedding.""
Cadoc was startled. ""What?""
""We only got the marriage certificates. I want a real ceremony,"" she said softly, ""Make up for what I never had.""
That was part of her plan.
When Ella returned, a grand wedding would prove she was Cadoc's legal wife.
Cadoc was silent for a while, then gave a short nod. ""Fine. I promise you.""
When Emma arrived at the Ziegler's villa, Levi was lounging on the couch, grinning at her.
""It's been a while, Mrs. Fitzgerald.""
He ran a finger along her face. Though she felt sick, she kept her cool and didn't move away.
The first two days of torment were relatively mild. Levi simply had people take her blood, one vial after another.
She got used to the feeling of needles. But watching her blood fill those tubes made her stomach turn.
Then came the third day. Half-asleep, she overheard the bodyguards talking outside.
""Has Mr. Ziegler lost it? Is he truly planning to turn her into a specimen?""
""He said she's so beautiful that she should be preserved forever if she dies.""
Emma's blood ran cold.
Cadoc promised she'd be safe. Instead, she was going to die here.
A chill crept through her whole body. She bit her lip until she tasted blood just to stop herself from shaking.
Seizing a moment of the bodyguards' carelessness, she grabbed a crystal ornament from the bedside and hurled it at the window.
Crash!
Glass shards went flying. She picked up a shard, cut herself free, and jumped from the second story. A sharp snap came from her ankle as she hit the ground.
Pain shot through her leg, but she didn't stop.
With a sprained ankle, she limped out of the Ziegler's villa and made her way back to the Fitzgerald's villa.
As she stepped into the living room, she saw Cadoc down on one knee, gently tending to Sophie's ankle with medication.
""Cadoc..."" Sophie's eyes were red. ""Ms. Jefferson has been gone this long. Are you not worried at all?""
Cadoc froze for a second. Then, he spoke softly, ""I only care about you. Why didn't you tell me you were hurt? You know that breaks my heart.""
Emma stood soaking wet in the doorway, her ankle swollen and throbbing, but he didn't even notice.
She walked past them blankly.
""Ella?"" Cadoc finally looked up and jumped to his feet. ""You—""

Chapter 7
Cadoc gave her a once-over, checking if she was hurt. When he saw she was fine, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. ""What happened these last three days?""
Emma smiled bitterly, her lips cracked and bleeding. ""Nothing.""
She didn't waste time and asked, ""When will you hold the wedding you promised me?""
Sophie snapped her head up. ""What wedding?""
Cadoc paused before answering, ""We're having a ceremony.""
Seeing Sophie's eyes go red, he immediately explained, ""It's just a ceremony, Sophie. I only care about you.""
She forced a smile. ""I get it. I'm not upset. You're just trying to save me.""
Then, she turned to Emma and smiled sweetly. ""Ms. Jefferson, how about I help you pick out the perfect wedding dress?""
Over the next few days, Sophie stuck to Emma like glue as she tried on wedding dresses.
At the bridal boutique, Emma stood in front of the mirror wearing a white wedding dress that hugged her waist nicely. Sophie stayed close, inspecting every dress and nitpicking every little thing.
""This one's neckline is way too low,"" Sophie said, tugging at the fabric near Emma's collar. ""Change to something more conservative.""
Then, she grabbed another dress and commented, ""This cut doesn't do your figure any favors. Mrs. Fitzgerald should never look this basic.""
Emma stayed silent, doing whatever she was told like a lifeless puppet.
When they finally settled on a dress, Sophie dropped her fake act in the now-empty fitting room.
""So you're not truly distant—you're just playing hard to get.""
She gripped Emma's wrist hard, her nails digging in. ""Don't think you can just steal Cadoc from me. He's mine!""
Emma didn't react. She pulled her hand away without saying a word.
There was no act of playing hard to get, and she never meant to steal Cadoc away.
She wanted out of this mess more than anyone.
But Sophie was convinced Emma was trying to take Cadoc from her and started stirring up more drama.
On the eve of the wedding, Cadoc kicked Emma's door open.
""You locked Sophie in the fitting room?!"" he said gloomily, ""Do you know she has claustrophobia?!""
Emma shut her eyes tiredly. ""It wasn't me.""
""You're still denying it?"" he shouted, yanking her up. ""Looks like you haven't learned your lesson.""
Ignoring her protests, he told the bodyguards to throw her into a dark, musty basement.
In the pitch black, Emma curled up in the corner. Sometime after midnight, she heard faint noises.
Then, a bag of live rats had been tossed in.
She screamed, bolted upright, and started pounding on the door. Her nails tore, but no one answered her calls of agony.
The next morning, Cadoc opened the door coldly. ""It was just one night. Do you have to cry all night?""
After enduring a night of torment, Emma looked drained and pale. ""Sophie sent the rats in...""
Cadoc scoffed. ""Sophie would never do anything like that.""
He flipped on the light. ""Where are those rats then?""
Emma's eyes widened.
The basement was spotless—not a rat or even a trace left behind.
Sophie had erased all the proof.
Emma wanted to explain, but she gave up.
Cadoc's voice turned cold. ""The wedding is in three days. I'll be spending time with Sophie until then. I'll show up on that day.""
He shot her a warning glare. ""Don't do anything stvpid. Otherwise, the wedding is off.""

Chapter 8
Cadoc threw those words out coldly before turning and walking away.
His footsteps faded into the distance as Emma slowly pushed herself up, using the wall for support.
She shut herself away in her room for the next three days, barely stepping outside.
She barely touched the meals the maids brought her, just picking at a few bites. No matter how sunny it got, she refused to leave her room.
She didn't want to give Sophie another shot at setting her up.
Cadoc, like he promised, stayed with Sophie the entire time and didn't even come home.
Emma saw their outings all over the gossip sites.
Sophie clung to Cadoc's arm, flashing a sweet smile. And Cadoc? He looked down at her gently.
The day before the wedding, Emma sat at her desk, scribbling a list of everything Cadoc liked and couldn't stand.
""He hates cilantro and can't handle spicy food. He only drinks coffee without sugar. His shirts must be perfectly ironed. He needs pitch darkness to sleep...""
After writing, she folded the note neatly and called over the maid, Tiana Rivera.
""Hold on to this for me,"" she said softly. ""Give it back after the wedding.""
Tiana blinked in confusion. ""Mrs. Fitzgerald, what's this for?""
""In case I forget. "" Emma smiled slightly. ""You know how bad my memory has been lately.""
Tiana still looked puzzled, but she nodded and took the note. ""Alright, Mrs. Fitzgerald. I'll keep it safe.""
After Tiana left, Emma pulled out a suitcase she had packed days ago from the back of the closet.
She glanced around the room she'd called home for three years, her eyes pausing on the wedding photo on the wall.
Cadoc looked handsome in his suit, and she was in a stunning gown, smiling softly.
Emma took the photo down, laid it face down on the table, and walked out without looking back.
At the airport lobby, Zoey had been waiting.
She handed Emma a plane ticket and a bank card. ""That's five million. From now on, you have zero ties to the Jefferson family.""
Emma's fingers shook slightly as she accepted them.
When she looked up, Zoey wasn't even looking at her.
""Thanks,"" Emma said softly.
Zoey's tone stayed cold. ""You've done a good job in the past three years. The partnership between the families stayed intact.""
She paused before adding, ""Go live the life you want.""
Emma nodded, turned, and headed toward the security gate.
Before turning the corner, she took one last glance back. Zoey was already gone. Her figure looked so firm, like Emma had never been her daughter at all.
But Emma didn't feel broken. She held the plane ticket tightly, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.
This time, she could finally live for herself.
Without looking back, she walked straight toward the boarding gate.
At the Fitzgerald's villa, a woman who looked almost identical to Emma slipped into a wedding dress and sat quietly, waiting for the ceremony the next day.

1njz8ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1njz8ar/any_middle_ground_or_rethink_the_relationship/,"Any middle ground or rethink the relationship, stay or leave (35F, 48M)?","I, 35F am in a long-term relationship with my
SO, 48M for 8 years. Shortly after we began dating, I learned that he is friends with most of his exes as according to him, this is normal in their culture and that they parted ways amicably so he does not see a reason to completely cut them out of his life. Meanwhile, I believe and do not see the point in
maintaining friendships with previous partners.
This POV has even been strengthened after I got into an abusive relationship where I tried to be ""cool"" with my then-partner's exes. Long story short, it didn't end well, partner cheated with the ex. So, I vowed to myself never to let someone cross my boundary again or bend back to accomodate any friendship with exes.

Fast forward, I met my current SO who is friends with his exes. He talks positively about them and I am okay with discussions about them. But we got into a huge fight months after dating almost 8 years ago after I learned that he had coffee with ""an old friend"" which I literally took as an old friend (no previous romantic relationship whatsoever) as in my culture, we do not call old flames as old friends. We state clearly who they are/were in relation to us so it was a shock to me when I learned that he actually went to see an ex.
Right there and then, I questioned the ambiguity of the whole situation, why not describe her who she was to him previously? I told him that I was not okay with the whole coffee thing and in general, I am not okay with a partner being friends with exes and that I am willing to step back from the relationship for him to continue accomodating these friendships.

He took this personally and accused me of being unfair and that it should not be a basis for us to break up then. He decided then to stay no contact with most of his exes to accomodate our relationship and because he wants this relationship with me. And so, we pursued a relationship with each other.

Recently, one of his exes texted him and he told me about it and asked whether he should reply? I did not know what to say as I felt it was his decision to make and I thought I was clear with my boundaries? Anyway, he didn't reply to her and voilà! we, unexpectedly ran into her.
She was happy to see him, they talked and of course, I felt uncomfortable but was still civil towards her. After that, me and my partner got into a huge fight as he said that he felt bad for her and felt embarrassed himself that she had to ask why he was not responding to her texts and that she might be wondering why he may be acting standoffish. At the same time, he also feels bad for me because he noticed my silence during the interaction and that it was an uncomfortable situation. He added that he thought me and his ex have a lot in common that we may actually warm up to each other but I blatantly said no, I do not do friendships with a partner's ex.

I asked him then how does he want to move forward/deal with this? His answer was nothing much to do as I am not okay with it but he maintains that in his culture, it is normal to be friends with exes. I also maintained my stance that I would walk away if my partner maintained such connections especially that I have expressed my discomfort already in the beginning. No hard feelings, it is just that we see things differently to which he replied, I am threatening him. My statements are threats.

So... I feel bad about this - that somehow I control my partner's actions but at the same time, I feel that I am just being true to myself and upholding my boundaries. Him feeling bad about his behavior towards her makes me look and feel like I should be guilty. At the back of my head, I thought that I should just have broken off the budding relationship back then to not have to deal with this but part of me wants to concede and tell him that I will try to be okay with this but I am also free to walk away when I cannot stand it anymore.

P.S. I am currently into therapy for the abusive relationship I got out of and re-learning how to establish my boundaries.

Edit: Partner thinks that my boundary is unfair given that it is based from my past experiences to which I argued, boundaries are in place to protect oneself to eventual danger or harm. We do not set boundaries when something has already happened. He also argues that upholding such boundary when he did not do something wrong is unreasonable.",1,1758171045.0,relationship_advice,6,0.99,False

1njz69v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1njz69v/is_it_worth_purchasing_an_electric_kettle_for/,Is it worth purchasing an electric kettle for home use?,"Hey everyone! I've been wanting to share my experience with electric kettles since I made the switch from my old stovetop kettle a few months ago. Let me tell you - it's been a total game-changer for my daily routine.

I was skeptical at first, wondering if an electric kettle was really worth the investment. Like many of you, I thought, ""Why fix something that isn't broken?"" But after my ancient stovetop kettle finally gave up on me, I decided to give an electric one a try. I found some great options at https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle and honestly, I haven't looked back since.

The convenience factor alone is worth it. You know how it goes - you're rushing in the morning, trying to make coffee or tea, and waiting for water to boil feels like watching paint dry. With my electric kettle, I just hit a button and go about my morning routine. By the time I'm done feeding my cat or checking my phone, the water's ready. No more hovering around the stove!

What really surprised me was the energy efficiency. These modern electric kettles actually use less electricity than boiling water on the stove. Plus, they have automatic shut-off features, so you don't have to worry about leaving them on (something I was guilty of doing with my stovetop kettle more times than I'd like to admit).

Temperature control is another huge plus. If you're into different types of tea or pour-over coffee, you'll appreciate being able to get the exact temperature you need. Green tea at 175°F? No problem. French press coffee at 200°F? Easy peasy.

The prices vary quite a bit, but you can find really good options for any budget. I browsed through several models at https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle before making my choice, and there's something for everyone - from basic models to fancy ones with all the bells and whistles.

Some extra perks I've discovered:
- They're great for instant noodles (college students, take note!)
- Perfect for hot chocolate on cold nights
- Super helpful for cooking when you need boiling water quickly
- Most have water level indicators, so you only boil what you need

Bottom line? If you're on the fence about getting an electric kettle, I'd say go for it. It's one of those purchases that you don't realize how much you needed until you have one. The time and energy savings alone make it worth the investment, and the convenience factor is just the cherry on top.

1njz590,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_90DayKoreanOfficial/comments/1njz590/how_to_avoid_plateaus_in_korean_learning/,How to Avoid Plateaus in Korean Learning,"Almost everyone hits a plateau at some point. Progress slows down, and it feels like nothing is improving. Here are some practical ways to break through, with examples you can try right away.

# 1. Change Your Input

If you only use one type of resource, your brain adapts too quickly. Switch it up.

* If you only study textbooks → watch one K-drama with Korean subtitles.
* If you only watch dramas → listen to a 10-minute Korean podcast every morning.
* If you like webtoons → add short news articles for formal vocabulary.

# 2. Practice Speaking

Passive learning creates plateaus. Speaking forces you to reorganize what you know.

* Narrate what you are doing: ""물을 마셔요. 책을 읽어요.""
* Join a free online language exchange and talk once a week.
* Record yourself summarizing a drama episode in Korean.

# 3. Set Small Challenges

Micro-goals keep things fresh and motivating.

* Write three diary sentences every night.
* Order coffee in Korean at a cafe.
* Memorize 10 slang phrases from a drama and use them in a chat with a friend.

# 4. Review Old Material

Looking back shows how much progress you’ve made.

* Re-read your old vocab lists and notice which words are now easy.
* Redo a beginner grammar workbook exercise—it will feel faster and clearer.
* Rewatch the first drama you tried with subtitles off.

# 5. Balance Grammar and Vocabulary

One without the other leads to limits. Pair them together.

* Learn the grammar pattern **-지만 (but)** and practice it with new vocab: ""맛있지만 비싸요."" (It’s delicious, but expensive.)
* Learn the verb **놀다 (to hang out)** and combine it with a past tense structure: ""친구랑 놀았어요."" (I hung out with a friend.)

# 6. Keep Learning Fun

Motivation often disappears before skills do. Fun brings it back.

* Make a Korean music playlist and learn one chorus by heart.
* Watch a variety show like *Running Man* for natural conversation.
* Follow Korean meme accounts on Instagram or X for casual expressions.

Plateaus are normal, but they don’t last forever. Small challenges, active speaking, varied input, and fun activities will help restart progress.

1njz579,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1njz579/any_middle_ground_or_rethink_the_relationship/,"Any middle ground or rethink the relationship, stay or leave (35F, 48M)?","I, 35F am in a long-term relationship with my
SO 48M for 8 years. Shortly after we began dating, I learned that he is friends with most of his exes as according to him, this is normal in their culture and that they parted ways amicably so he does not see a reason to completely cut them out of his life. Meanwhile, I believe and do not see the point in maintaining friendships with previous partners. This POV has even been strengthened after I got into an abusive relationship where I tried to be ""cool"" with my then-partner's exes. Long story short, it didn't end well, partner cheated with the ex. So, I vowed to myself never to let someone cross my boundary again or bend back to accomodate any friendship with exes.

Fast forward, I met my current SO who is friends with his exes. He talks positively about them and I am okay with discussions about them. But we got into a huge fight months after dating almost 8 years ago after I learned that he had coffee with ""an old friend"" which I literally took as an old friend (no previous romantic relationship whatsoever) as in my culture, we do not call old flames as old friends. We state clearly who they are/were in relation to us so it was a shock to me when I learned that he actually went to see an ex.
Right there and then, I questioned the ambiguity of the whole situation, why not describe her who she was to him previously? He said that it is normal in his culture to address exes as old friends and that he really does see her as an old friend. I told him that I was not okay with the whole coffee thing and in general, I am not okay with a partner being friends with exes and that I am willing to step back from the relationship for him to continue accomodating these friendships.

He took this personally and accused me of being unfair and that it should not be a basis for us to break up then. He decided then to stay no contact with most of his exes because he wants this relationship with me. And so, we pursued a relationship with each other.

Recently, one of his exes texted him and he told me about it and asked whether he should reply? I did not know what to say as I felt it was his decision to make and I thought I was clear with my boundaries? Anyway, he didn't reply to her and voilà! we, unexpectedly ran into her.
She was happy to see him, they talked and of course, I felt uncomfortable but was still civil towards her. After that, me and my partner got into a huge fight as he said that he felt bad for her and felt embarrassed himself that she had to ask why he was not responding to her texts and that she might be wondering why he may be acting standoffish. At the same time, he also feels bad for me because he noticed my silence during the interaction and that it was an uncomfortable situation. He added that he thought me and his ex have a lot in common that we may actually warm up to each other but I blatantly said no, I do not do friendships with a partner's ex.

I asked him then how does he want to move forward/deal with this? His answer was nothing much to do as I am not okay with it but he maintains that in his culture, it is normal to be friends with exes. I also maintained my stance that I would walk away if my partner maintained such connections especially that I have expressed my discomfort already in the beginning. No hard feelings, it is just that we see things differently to which he replied, I am threatening him. My statements are threats.

So... I feel bad about this - that somehow I control my partner's actions but at the same time, I feel that I am just being true to myself and upholding my boundaries. Him feeling bad about his behavior towards her makes me look and feel like I should be guilty. At the back of my head, I thought that I should just have broken off the budding relationship back then to not have to deal with this but part of me wants to concede and tell him that I will try to be okay with this but I am also free to walk away when I cannot stand it anymore.

P.S. I am currently into therapy for the abusive relationship I got out of and re-learning how to establish my boundaries.

Edit: Partner thinks that my boundary is unfair given that it is based from my past experiences to which I argued, boundaries are in place to protect oneself to eventual danger or harm. We do not set boundaries when something has already happened. He also argues that upholding such boundary when he did not do something wrong is unreasonable.",2,1758170753.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

“…brand-new activity called Reclaim, a three-player mission where resources are limited and playing as a team is a requirement for success.”

From Edge of Fate reveal stream (around 42 minute mark)

“Inspiration for major updates is Into the Light”
“With it came onslaught a new type of activity”
“Ash and Iron bringing a new activity, Reclaim”

I couldn’t find the exact quote but somewhere along the line the fact that “reclaim is a new thing we haven’t done before” came up, and I have reason to believe I didn’t dream that up because Liv mentioned the same thing on Aztecross’s podcast



Reclaim is hardly any of what was described. It is technically a new activity in name. There is no limited resources (on the contrary there are heavy ammo crates wherever you need them). 

It’s not a new type of activity, essentially a nether downgrade, which was itself a twist on overthrow from the pale heart. 

I think something happed to this activity. Maybe someone spilled coffee on their computer or it wasn’t ready. Either way, it seems like devs panicked and duct taped together a bunch of generic D2 mechanics into a hollow activity. 

It reeks of it. The encounter and hidden chests don’t give loot. The three versions of the activity are actually the same 7-8 areas in different orders. The vehicles they showed off in the trailer (ironically being the most unique aspect of the activity) aren’t nearly as big a part of the gameplay as advertised.

Overall healthy (I hope, I feel good to this start but currently lost my Medicaid as I just turned 27 AND the whole government thing ooffff

Eitherway not to make anything political, this is my 3rd time doing keto. But my first time since getting with my fiancee which she is a big help! 

We are doing this together but differently as she likes some legumes and some rice: my last non-keto meal was her stir fry which was wonderful! (May have been under 50 grams actually)I finished it off without the rice tonight with some chicken sausage scramble I made with 4 eggs (fresh from my area in VA, and also some eggs from NC to enjoy too:

we went to OBX and bought out the last two dozen from a lovely self serve stand (by “the kind cup” coffee shop in old town Corolla, cup is on your right if you make that last left as you turn off NC 12 keep going straight to the next intersection (the original Corolla school house from late 1800s is to your left, look straight ahead then slight to your left and you’ll see the stand signage)

Back to my weight loss: 

I’ve lost 40 pounds twice before  in two months each time, my lowest weight was 292 which was lower than I was when i graduated high school ha ha ha 

Intend to get to 250, then maybe just maybe I’ll set 216 as my LOWEST I remember when I was 11 for now in case I may look like a bean pole but I’m prob a endomorph (possibly meso)  so I may be ok at 200 who knows…

Sorry to be long winded but this helps keep my mind off cravings ha ha but overall they are minimal!

I tend to stick to keto bread as I still love me a nice bologna sammich with some nice cheddar (yea, I know it’s sandwich lol)

Lots of beef jerky (the past two times, trying to avoid sodium more for health sake)

Cauliflower rice or mashed cauliflower for possible meatloaf (I just came up with that, gotta change the binder ingredient though and possible sauce recipe)

Nothing really too exciting currently but the fiancee helps me with ideas as do I for her

I’m thinking this is gonna be THE TIME it’ll happen finally!! Here’s to 250!!!

1njyzx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1njyzx5/ever_since_my_son_was_born_something_has_been/,"Ever Since my Son was Born, Something has been watching him (Final Part)","o pre-phrase this part, I am currently writing this first section before I meet up with the man who sent the letter. I appreciate the little help I got and the words of caution. The situation from my last post hasn't changed much. Iris, Luke, Archie, and I are still at my mother's place. Those things haven't come back. I was prompted to try Google to search for any information about the coins I was given. After a moment of poorly scouring the internet, I eventually found what I was looking for. The Coins are Greek Drachma. I almost glossed past them, however, as the one that was sent to me in the mail seems to be a less common version. I remembered the one that was tossed into my car, resembling the Owl imagery that also appears on a lot of the images I could find online. I also later found the Coin underneath my car seat. I hadn't removed it since it was tossed in there months back. 

This may seem a little scatterbrained; Im just nervous about meeting with this thing… or at least the thing feels right to say. Assuming it's the same guy from the gas station. I've got Archie staying here while im out. He has his gun, and we know that, for whatever reason, the police at least work to scare these things away. I also just spoke with Iris. I finally told her. She was in the kitchen, still noticeably shaken after what had happened. She's a strong woman, though; it's what caught my attention when we first met, though over the years I've been able to pick up on her tells. It's small things, like little glances or uncomfortable smiles, that give her away. I approached her, asked her how she was doing, and once we had started talking. I told her. I told her about the bird stalking our son, about the split-faced creature that came into our home and threw me to the wall… how I think those things that attacked us not too long ago were connected to it. 

I even told her how it all seems to be happening because they are after Luke. 

“Why are they after our son?” She asked with a great sense of dread.

“I dont know”

“Do you think it's some sort of punishment?”

“Punishment for what?” 

“I dont know... he wasn't exactly born in the best of circumstances”

“I dont think we're being punished for our baby surviving that night. Also, we weren't the only ones.”

“But the cops said-” she said before I cut her off.

“I know what the cops said… but those things clearly aren't normal.”

Iris paused for a moment, taking a deep, shaky breath. In the silence, I had realised i raised my voice, not in any way that would warrant worry, but it brought me back to before she got pregnant, the fights we had. I wasn't proud of how I was, but before the thought could linger any further, she asked. 

“So what are we gonna do?” 

“I dont know. I did get a letter, though. Remember that weird guy at the gas station I mentioned?”

“The one with the cut-up face, yeah?”

“I think he wants to meet with me. I dont know if it's safe, but I feel he might have some answers.”

She didn't like the idea as much as I did, but we decided it'd be better to try and get some answers than to keep being in the dark. So Im about to drive over there. The rest of this post will be from me once I get back.

\-break-

So I drove out to the place that was listed, a small cafe just a few blocks away from my mom's apartment. It wasn't any brand I recognised, so I assumed it was a family-owned business since it didn't give off the vibe of some smaller privately owned shop. I stepped inside, the place being a bit on the empty side, with only 2 other people in there besides me and the staff. Just some old man sat at the counter reading a newspaper, and a scruffy-looking man was about college age. 

After ordering a plain coffee at the counter, I went over and sat down at one of the empty tables. I was sitting alone for probably a few seconds before a man sat down across from me. I hadn't seen him come in, though, with everything that's happened in the last few months, and that didn't surprise me. He didn't look like anyone I had met; he had olive skin, dark brown curly hair and youthful features. Despite the difference in appearance, one thing remained from the man i knew him to be. His cheeks, sunken in as if slit or cut, stretched out his mouth despite not connecting to the corners of his soft smile. “Alex… it is good to see you again.” He said, his voice soft and calming, just like last time. This time, I was a lot more to the point. 

“Who are you… and no cryptic shit or changing the subject, weird shit has been happening to me ever since I met you at that gas station, now talk”

“I will, though I'd keep your voice down. I chose this place because it was close, and barely anyone comes here, though that does not mean no one will hear you speak.”

I was stressed, but he was right. After taking a second to focus on what I wanted to ask next, I quieted down and asked.

“A name would be a good start. Who are you?”

“Your people have many names for me”

“I said no cryptic shit”

“I do not mean to be cryptic; it is simply a difficult question to answer for someone in my position… I believe Gabriel is what the Christians called me, though that was because I snuck myself into their beliefs when the Romans were shifting over. The oldest name I remember is Piled Stones. Hermes and Mercury are the ones I've known the longest, though. Some Romans also called me Odin when encountering the North Folk. Though I dont remember ever travelling to your northern lands at that period”

“So you're a God?”

“No… yes… Its complicated.""

“So you're not a god?”

“God is a difficult term to use. We aren't immortal, we aren't all-powerful. We live a long time and can do a lot, but our forms and existences are bound by rules, areas, and domains.”

“So not a god, but you're like a god?”

“If that sufficiently answers your question, then yes”

His answer had me sit there for a moment before I decided to accept it and move on, as I realised a straight answer wasn't what I was going to get from that line of questioning. 

“Ok… So if you, Hermes… What's with the Bird?” 

“That would be my mother. Well, my mother, in the sense that she's married to my father, my mother was a human woman.”

“So, who's that… Aphrodite?”

“That is my Great Aunt…Also, my former sister in law” 

“That's weird, dude.” He just shrugged at that comment, seeming to understand how I found it odd, but not caring, I followed on by asking. 

“So, your mother, who is that?”

“Hera is her Oldest Name.”

“And what does she want with my Son?”

“...well, that is your first mistake”

“What is?” He went quiet for a moment, sliding another coin across the table. He then looked me in the eye, as the calming feeling his voice put over me began to fade, and I felt my anxiety creep back in.

“The coins are items that allow for our world to be fully understood by you mortals… but they also hide you from us, and hide our twisting of reality and perception from you when nearby.”

“That doesn't answer my question”

“It doesn't, but it is necessary”

“Then go on.”

“Your posts… you've only made a couple, but you're sharing the story? Tell me. Have you ever described Luke? Yourself? Your wife?”

It took me a second to think… other than his weight and a few small details from what I remember, I hadn't. Though at the time, I rationalised it. “I dont want to post that on the internet. I've already got Bird Monsters and Mutant Baby people coming after me, I dont need creepers on the internet, too” He looked at me with a sorrowful face afterwards, shaking his head as he moved on.

“Describe yourself to me”

“What?”

“Humour me”

“Ok, uhm. Long Blond hair, short beard, white, blue eyes, Kind of a thin face?”

“Now Iris”

“...Also white. She's a redhead, green eyes, pale with freckles… where are you going with this?”

“Now… Luke”

“Hes a baby… they kinda look the same…”

“That's not a description”

“What are you even trying to get at?”

“Describe your son”

“Hes…” I then tried to focus on it, thinking about every time I've lain beside him, played with him, held him in my arms, and every time I've thought about him while all of this shit was going on. My son, to whom I have devoted the last 3 months of my life. I couldn't think of a single detail. I tried to think, pushed and pushed, feeling a singular tear run down my face as I couldn't even provide 1 detail about my son. 

Then he took the coin from the table and placed it in my palm, telling me.

“Close your eyes, your mind can not handle what you'll witness before you” I follow his instructions as I feel the rusted metal in my palm. Like a freight train, a moment of clarity hits me… My son looked nothing like me or his mother. Not because he was a baby, he had no features from either of his parents, his hair was dark black, his skin tanned, his eyes an unnatural yellow. How had no one pointed this out? How did no one say anything? My family and friends had seen him. In a panic, I open my eyes and see the true form of the being ahead of me. His outline shifting, his form changing, the only part of his body that seemed solid was the rough, serpentine body that made up his torso and head, with a long tail that i couldn't find an end off; his body was a shifting frame, some parts merging with flesh, some parts piercing in through spiraling and painful looking protrusions of metal. Coiling around the mechanical appendages that made up his arms were 2 smaller serpents that rested upon his shoulders. 

He had no eyes. That was the thing that stuck with me, no sockets or indents, no sign they were ever there, just 4 slits that ride up from just above the nose that bulge into growths that sprouted up like coral… With a moment that left a blister on my hand from the friction, he snatched the coin from my grasp, his form shifting back to the almost humanoid one I had seen him in. 

“What… Why… What?” I stammered out. For some reason, despite knowing what i saw, I felt like i couldn't trust my thoughts on the matter, feeling a tight grip of confusion strangle my brain. Like, the description i gave would have been wrong if i looked again, or if the thing i saw sat across from me had nothing to do with anything I just said, and that's all I could figure out to call the pieces that make up that monstrous form.

He reassures me to the best of his ability, telling me. 

“Take deep breaths. Try to think of other things, your mind will rationalise what you've seen soon enough.”

“What… You're no god” 

“I never said i was” 

“What, what are you…” 

“The only one who will tell you the truth… that your son is not your own.” 

I reached over the table and gripped his shirt, though he barely moved as i felt my fingers grip past something other than fabric. The woman at the counter yelled over, hastily telling me to get off him and not to fight. 

“What do you mean he's not mine…” 

“Your wife doesn't know it either… But that child is my father's… my brother” 

I'd give anything to believe it's not true. Believe that all this was some sick dream that I'd wake up from in a moment. Yet I stayed awake, my attention dragged over as he continued. 

“My Mother has a habit of punishing those with whom my father commits adultery, as she is not powerful enough to punish him herself” 

“So what, because some lightning god couldn't keep it in his pants and fucked my wife, we have to suffer.”

“Not We… you are simply caught in the crossfire. She just wants your wife and child.” I was just about ready to hit him again after that, but I knew it wouldn't do anything. 

“So is that why you gave me these?” 

I'd say taking out the envelope and carefully pouring the other 2 coins onto the table, being careful not to touch them after what happened previously. As the metal clanked against the table, and I looked up at his face, a chill ran down my spine. His face the whole time had been this calm, uncaring smile, very little reaction even when i have been aggressive, but now, his face had dropped. 

“Go home… Now” 

“What?”

“Now, get in your car, and go to your wife and son. If you're fast enough, you may get there in time” 

“Are they in danger?” 

He finally snapped back at me, aggression in his voice, “I told you, the coins hide you from themIt'sts why they saw you when you were at the mall, and you brought both the coins i gave you here!” 

His words sink in like a knife to my gut, and i dont even hesitate. I run to my car outside and drive off, leaving in such a hurry that i clip one of the cars parked in front of me as I shoot off down the street. My knuckles were turning white as i gripped the wheel with intense focus. Hermes was right, the cafe was closed and almost as if i blacked out on the drive, I was at my mother's apartment, bursting out of the car and through the building's door.

Step after step, i charged up the stairs, until i got to our floor and saw the door wide open, hearing the blood-curdling scream from down the hall. I made a charge into the room. I wish there were a monster, some horrific god or beast i could at least pretend I'd be able to fight to save Iris, save my son.

But i couldn't. Luke was nowhere to be found. I couldn't see him anywhere, couldn't hear him cry, didn't know where he was. Iris, on the other hand. She was lying across the ground as i came into the room. Her screams continued as i heard her loud, shrill cries slowly turn into squeals, her bones snapping and contorting as I rushed over to her. I try to comfort her for a moment before her body begins to swell. A vile, disgusting transformation, slow and painful. That thing didn't kill her; it wouldn't do that, that's too easy. Instead, it decided a fitting punishment for the simple act of unknowingly birthing the son of a god was to turn her into a beast. 

She couldn't even get words out by the time I had gotten there, the pain of her transformation too much to bear. Eventually, her pain was over, but by that point, she was no longer human. Just a large mass of pink flesh, a squealing boar in the centre of the living room. There was nothing i could do, i made a mistake and it cost me my wife, cost me my… His son. 

He appeared once more, stood behind me, once again in his trench coat and hat, covering his shifting form. No longer human. 

“It was a mistake, a foolish one, but you couldn't have known. I apologise for snapping at you mortal… this is a story i have witnessed time and time again”

I didn't reply, just sat there with a whole pig in my arms, one that used to be the woman i loved. 

“I couldn't help her either… but if you wish, i may bargain with Mother. I may return your son to you if you wish it so; however, it comes at a cost”

I sat there, tears streaming down my face as the beast lay its head on my lap, heaving.

“If we can't undo this… then Luke would be all i have left here… what will it take?” 

He took a moment, his silence being louder than any word he could have spoken as he raised an arm, handing me a knife. 

I stared up with a moment of confusion, followed by hesitation, then sheer defeat. Finally hearing him speak.

“It is cruel what things of our kind do to your mortals… However, appeasement to what you call gods is the only way. Your bones are like twigs, your flesh like paper, your view of the world a small pond in a world surrounded by vast oceans. However, even the smallest of creatures serve their role… appeasement is one mortal kind that has taken on for themselves.”

He'd drop the knife to the floor, “If you want your son back”, he'd add before kicking over the knife and finishing “Appese her” 

There was no way to undo what had happened, no way to fix her, my love. The one who always made me smile on a bad day, the one who knew me better than i knew myself, the one who made me laugh and smile… we weren't perfect, but nothing is beautiful because it's perfect. 

I grasped the knife and raised it high, feeling my hand tremble as i did so. Even though all that stared back at me were the unfeeling eyes of an animal, all i could think about was what i was ending. It wasn't just her life; it was ours. It'd be casting out any chance of saving her and forcing her into a mental slideshow of memories. 

Even though it was lightweight weight something as simple as a knife made me feel as if i was holding up the world. There was no sound, nothing else in that moment but the hardest choice i could make… until that silence was broken. 

Crying. 

The familiar cry of my son, even though he wasn't mine. I've been with him since day one, i looked after him, and made sure he was safe. He was mine, and i could hear him crying. 

I turned around and plunged the knife into the chest of the figure, feeling soft flesh give way, as hollow bones snapped, the trenchcoated form behind me no longer the man i met, the one who claimed himself hermes, instead it was that head splitting form i had witnessed all those nights ago, that horrific feathered monstrosity and i had just stabbed it. Though indoing so, from what was previously covered by a trenchcoat, i saw my son slipping from the creature's grasp.

I fell to the floor as he fell, catching him in my arms, the creature screeching as it plucked the knife from its chest. It howled at me, crying out in words to hold for me to know, and that i should never have heard. I gripped Luke tightly in my arms, and stood between him and the beast, looking it dead in its eyes, peering from hanging flesh upon the dies of its torn open face. 

My mind was attacking itself, blood dripped from my nose, but i watched and gritted my teeth. Thinking of all the nights it watched him, those things it sent after us, how it threw me into a wall and how it nearly had me kill my own wife. 

I looked and scoured.

She lunged at me, Long bony arms coated in features reaching me long before her body did, talons sinking into my flesh, but i held Luke tight. The cold, sharp feeling piercing my gut, the strange sensation of blood gushing from my body. Though the shock was the worst part. Not feeling pain would be a godsend for most, but in this instance, it was a strange agony. 

She attempted to pry me away from him, the adrenaline being the only thing keeping me conscious as they tore my flesh. 

Their loud screeching was only being overshadowed by the Strike of thunder from outside. We were no longer hidden, and he knew where we were. 

Her body crumpled, almost as if a hand i could not see grasped her entire form. I felt her claws be pulled from my body, her shifting mass stable for a mere moment before a flash of light filled the room. Before i knew it… she was gone. The sound of bones cracking as Iris returned to her normal state, and i dropped to the floor. 

Im writing this part now as im in the hospital. My doctors told me it's a miracle i survived, though my look of disgust at the term miracle seemed odd to them. I had been out for a while, a few months, from what i was told. Iris had been staying at a friend's place not too far from the hospital. Apparently, nothing else had happened while I had been unconscious. 

Hopefully, that's the last we see of that so-called god… it wasn't the last i saw of the one calling itself Hermes, however.  He visited the hospital briefly, and I was lying there, staring at the ceiling while the doctors were off filing some of my paperwork. He walked in, his form human once more, though he was wearing a helmet with a wide brim, wings on either side. That got a weak chuckle out of me, which seemed to amuse him. We said no words to each other. I simply gave a concerned expression, and he raised a hand almost as if to let me know it was over… he then placed a coin next to my bed, and took his leave. 

Luke, Iris and I are now just trying to go back to normal. Luke's appearance has gradually changed over time; he now has my nose and his mother's eyes. He came out a redhead just like her, too. It does keep me up at night, however, knowing that out there, there are beings way more powerful than we could ever hope. That's all, though… if anything else happens, I'll update you all, but for now. I want to live my life, and hope you all take care. ",3,1758170246.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1njyyr5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1njyyr5,Dupixent Experience - First Week - Any thoughts?,"I've had eczema for most of my life now. As a baby I had eczema around my lips due to contact with my pacifier. I always had eczema around the lips, dry ear insertions, and eczema on the inner joint connectors of the arms and legs.   


When I was in high-school most of that went away and it began appearing on my face, everything below the eyes. After trial and error with several typical treatments, topical steroids and creams, you name it, Tacrolimus 0.03 and 0.1 were game changers. To this day, I use Tacrolimus regularly and it is the only thing that can keep my face flare-free.

I have tried many things to curb eczema and not use Tacrolimus but it has all failed. I've been vegan for three months, stopped drinking coffee for 8 months, have only taken cold showers for maybe around 10 years straight (can't do warm to hot showers at all), etc.

Fast forward to adulthood, I'm currently 28 years of age. At 27 I started having eczema patches appear on my thighs, what I assume to be triggered by cold weather. It carried on into the warmer season to the point a good portion of my trunk, shoulders, and back were sprinkled with patches similar to those you'll see in the photos. Ignore these photos until you reach the part about Dupixent. And yes, always scratching at my sides and arms. 

At 28 years of age, it became much more out of control. Now it was getting very annoying and affecting my daily quality of life. I was waking up to scratch my legs and scalp for about a month and a half straight at 4 am. I was getting weeping eczema around the groin area. I would constantly pick and scratch at eczema until bleeding at home, work, etc. 

I have also tried new habits. I have HEPA filter vacuumed my carpet every day, deep cleaned it, used a dust-mite killing vacuum on my sheets, mattress, and other upholstery. I watch the sheets in warm water very frequently. I have changed the shower head, changed my detergent, stopped using a watch, cologne, etc. I shower in under 5 minutes, not using my eczema approved shower gel every single day. Also I have gotten a light therapy machine. I think I've done it all. 

Topical steroids like Triamcinolone have provided success on my back for a time period, but it is absolutely resistant and a failure on forearms and shins.   
  
Something to note is that every time I get out of the shower, the eczema flares up, turning bright red. Happens with any kind of water, just leaving that out there as a note. To my knowledge the area in which I live does not have hard water. 

Fast forward to roughly last week. Tuesday, September 9th, the hugest of flare ups. I felt that my bicep was a bout to peel off, itching was intolerable, it was just plain terrible. Luckily my dupixent was approved that afternoon for pickup, and I took the two loading dosage shots at around 5:00pm. It's as if my eczema was aware that it was soon going to be challenged. I took a nap until 7:00pm and when I woke up I felt barely any itching. 

Fast forward the next couple of days, I felt that more eczema patches began to break out, but they are all extremely dry. Now's the time for you to pay attention to the photos. It is a strange feeling really, they're not bright red, they don't itch (95% of the time), and they're super dry. Even with heavy duty moisturizers, they remain dry. The only time they flare up for 5 minutes at most is when I hop out of the shower. I have a weird contact situation with water I guess.

At the moment I'm not sure how to rate Dupixent. Let's say 5/10? I believe it added a hefty amount of patches to my skin, but none of them itch. Therefore the days are much more manageable and less annoying to get through. But, it seems my eczema has grown. Therefore, my concern is when these patches would go away. I assume that would be with the next dose in about 7 days from now. Let's hope.

The photos are from day 6 and day 7. Any thoughts?",1,1758170136.0,dupixent,2,1.0,False

Here’s a little about me: I don’t have a lot of time for social stuff; I work all the time. I have friends, I do stuff, but I’m always working when my friends are free. They are married and have kids—thrilled for them, but so vastly different from my own life; hence why I am here.

I enjoy reading—fiction, autobiographies, but mainly fiction; sleeping in on weekends; watching Netflix; exploring cafes; drinking iced coffee; and singing loudly to my music.

I am a night owl, and that probably won’t change. It's normal for me to drink Coca-Cola with lots of ice and listen to audiobooks or watch a series or a movie.

1njyuea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1njyuea/my_parents_found_out_i_was_using_snapchat_to_talk/,My parents found out I was using snapchat to talk to a guy i like,"i need some advice:  
context:

I 16f was caught the other day using snapchat on my phone. I've been talking to this guy I like \[17m\] recently on there. My parents have never liked snapchat and i wasn't meant to have it and i have been caught with it before once when i had a secret phone. As you can assume my parents were suspicious because I was talking to a boy on an app which deletes snaps and chats. My parents were saying after that I should have told them i was talking to someone, and asking why i was talking to him on snapchat if not for sending nudes. I feel like they don't understand that it was nothing like that and they don't understand the concept of a talking stage and snapping in gen z which is what this was. This incident turned into my mum saying i shouldn't be dating until im 18. She thinks the guy i was talking to just wants sex but i know i made my boundaries clear with him and i do have morals and i would stay true to them in the event he tried to push it which i believe he wouldn't. i understand their concerns and now have deleted snapchat. My dad is fifo and isn't home at the moment, he gets back monday. My mum made me call him and he seems to think the same as my mum but he said when he gets back the three of us are going to go get coffee and discuss this. For reference the last time they found my secret phone this situation was a hell of a lot worse at 14.

that was a bit of a brain dump but i need to know how to approach this situation.

my mum is suspecting ive met this guy again when i went to a sleepover at my best friends house which is true we went to a party and thats how i formally met him though i can never tell my parents about that party. i told them i met him at a previous party which he was actually at.

hes genuinely such a sweet guy and we share the same values and morals from what i've seen. i understand their concern but i do really like him and he asked me to go out with him somewhere after his exams are done. its hard now because my mum wants my phone kept outside my room and put on charge in the kitchen overnight. i am still in contact with him on instagram but i dont think my mum knows. she knows i have instagram and shes okay with that but i dont think she knows i talk to him on it still, but definitley not as much as i used to on snap which is sad since we both like eachother and have been talking for over a month.

its really annoying because my dad only gets back monday so this issue is kind of sitting and althoigh my mum is acting mostly normal shes asking whether ive been keeping my phone in the designated drawer and charging outside of my room and sometimes she'll brush me off and ignore me a bit so i know shes not 'over it'

im scared that they'll put parental controls on my phone like when i was 12/13 or not let me hang out with my bsf since she knew about this guy and also deleted everything and everyone on my snap after i told her what happened \[my mum doesn't know its all deleted but she does know i told my bsf to do it\] its also bad because i mentioned this morning another event which i want to go to \[summer camp reunion\] and she said 'we'll have to think about it' so that means that she definitely has lost all trust and i also overheard her saying that she has lost all trust in me. 

here is where i need advice

\- i want to convince my parents to let me go out with him/date him or atleast talk to him 

\- i need to build trust again somehow so they wont be suspicious of sleepovers with my bsf and so i can be trusted to go out in summer in a month or two

i just need some emotional support too, i know i shouldn't have had snap and i said that and im happy to not use it but i also do really like this guy and i know he'd ask me to be his gf at some point but now this is going to be so hard. before i was caught i was even thinking like when we're actually offically together i'll tell them about him. 

also i think my dad is more open than my mum but he will also go along with whatever she says. im hoping this 'coffee discussion' or whatever is a chance for me to convince them/earn the trust back.

let me know your advice and opinions please i need some insight

1njyu2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOdysseyHadAPurpose/comments/1njyu2b/significant_otherness_gebinah_yuri/,Significant Otherness (Gebinah Yuri),"*Gebura sat down on the sofa in front of her coffee table. She lit a cigarette, savoring its flavor for but a moment, before blowing out the smoke. The Patron of Language leaned back into the couch, her mind lost in thought. Something, or rather someone was troubling her heart.*

  
*Anytime she stumbled into Binah, things got embarrassing. Her heart would inexplicably flutter in the presence of that otherworldly woman, clad in black and feather. She was like a raven to her; a thing she cherished, but only deep down. In reality, she knew the answer, but she was too inexperienced and too scared to puzzle it out.*

  
*Her mind wandered, and she quickly discarded the thought. She could only think of her in increasingly awkward scenarios, so she decided to shelve it... she wanted to approach Binah regarding this, but Gebura was unsure how. Maybe.... maybe Roland knew something? She had to ask him, and she departed to do so, albeit begrudgingly.*

  
*Little did Gebura know that she was not alone.*

  
*Binah poured herself a glass of earl grey tea, sipping it for a moment and studying its flavor. Her mind wandered as well.. the way her heart races, her body heated up, all at the sight of Gebura. Binah had never felt this way before; Sure, she knew what that thrill she got from violence was, but... this was different. It was alien, unknown, and scary... but she liked it as well. She couldn't describe it, but she only knew that Gebura made her feel this way. She needed to confront her about it, but... she was scared. Scared she'd embarrass herself again, scared she'd give Gebura the wrong idea.. but she needed advice. She heard Malkuth had a book on this stuff, so she departed for the floor of history on short notice.*

  
*The two unknowingly had been pointed to the same place. They found the bookshelf, completely unaware of each other's presence, and began to scan the shelves for that fated book that would give them the advice they needed.*

  
*They only realized it too late. Upon locating the book, their hands touched at the spine of that lovey-dovey tome. Turning to face who had so gingerly grasped their hand, they saw that it was each other. Gebura was dumbfounded. She nearly gasped as her face grew red with embarrassment, and Binah turned around, chewing on her thumb as the temperature in the room rose. Both of them refused to look one another in the eye, too caught up in their own thoughts. Things like ""Oh god, what is she going to think of me now?"" or ""What do I do? She's right there."" ran through their heads like clockwork. Malkuth spotted Gebura burying her face into her hands, and she peered around, noticing Binah was beside herself, swaying side to side, trying to shake something off.*

  
""What seems to be the problem?"" *Malkuth inquired, practically skipping over. She noticed the section of the bookshelf the were at. One of the books was loose. She looked at the title, studying the faded lettering on the book's spine, before chuckling.*

  
""'How to approach your crush?' You can't be serious..."" *Malkuth giggled, finding great amusement in their jest.. only for her to realize that the duo were blushing. Occasionally shooting longing glances over each other's shoulders, refusing to even breathe in each other's presence.*

  
""Oh my god... you're serious."" *Malkuth was finally reading the room, and a big grin formed on her face.* ""Who knew you two would become a thing?""

  
""**WE'RE NOT A THING!!**"" *Both of the wheeled around, missing the humor in Malkuth suggestion, only to realize that they were looking at each other again, before sulking to themselves once more.*

""Look, just... don't get the wrong idea, ya hear?"" *Gebura stammered, before stamping her foot into the wooden floorboards and storming off in a huff. You could practically see the words ""doki-doki"" following her as her poor little heart tied itself into knots. Meanwhile, Binah stood frozen, lost to her own ruminations, before getting dizzy.*

  
*She collapsed to the floor, a trickle of a nosebleed dripping down her face. This was too much for her to process. This bizarre feeling was overtaking the two of them. Malkuth simply left her there, and the former arbiter departed shortly after.*

  
*Later in the week, the two decided to confide in someone. Someone who would take their thoughts and prayers with a lot of weight, and someone they knew they could trust: Hokma.*

  
*Unfortunately, they had the same idea, and they arrived at the same time. Hokma wandered out from his study, and saw something.. peculiar unfolding before him.*

  
""Can I help you?"" *He inquired with a bewildered expression. Hokma raised his eyebrow, seeing the tension between the two. It was palpable enough to be cut with a knife. He could glean what was going on between The Red Mist and her rival. He shut the book he was carrying, setting it down on an empty shelf, and simply sighed.* ""I see what's going on here."" *He stated simply, adjusting his monocle and gesturing for them to have a seat. However, he had not intention of sharing the table with them, much to their dismay.* ""I think it'd be best if you talk this out with each other. Would you like anything to drink?"" *Hokma proposed. Gebura ended up speaking first.* ""Uhm... t-tea... black tea would be... fine... I think.."" *Gebura's hardened demeanor had completely melted, and Binah's own oppressiveness held a new hue, stained by emotional tension.* ""What... she's getting... yes.. that.. that would be... nice..."" *Binah stammered.*

  
*Hokma went to prepare tea, and after around ten minutes, he returned, but he could tell they were about to open up to one another. Placing their cups onto the table would cut into this moment, so he decided to wait until they were more comfortable conversing with each other.*

  
""H-hey... Binah, I-"" *Gebura paused, waiting for the words to reach her lips.* ""Do you... have you been getting this weird... uhm... fleeting feeling around me? It's like... its kinda what I felt when Xiao was here, but more... personal.""

  
*Binah was processing those words, before building a response. She wanted to lie, she really did. Maybe this would be over with if she lied, but... Gebura would see through that. She decided to try anyway.*

  
""W-what do you mean? No... I... I'd never felt- I mean... I don't understand what you're... trying to say."" *Binah stammered, with little bullets of sweat rolling down her temples. She was now refusing to make eye contact, practically hiding within her own cloak.*

  
""Y-you're... such a bad liar... you know that?"" *Gebura spoke shakily.* ""Y-yeah.."" *Binah agreed. She couldn't help but enjoy this new feeling, as scary as it was. Then, Hokma placed the tea onto the table, and poured it into their cups from the kettle. Gebura took a sip.. it tasted better than.. well, when she normally drank tea. Something inexplicable enriched its flavor, and Binah also noticed. She shared that sentiment. Somehow... being with one another seemed to brighten up all the colors in their world. It made food taste better... but they shook away those thoughts. They simply savored the tea.*

  
""So... do... do you.."" *Gebura began, unable to finish.* ""I... I get the feeling that... we're more than just... friends.."" *Gebura spoke, pressing her fingers into one another.* ""Do you want to be... more than friends?""

  
*Binah slowly nodded.* ""Y-yes, I... I wouldn't mind that...""

  
""That's.... great to.. hear."" *Gebura slowly began to process what she proposed, and Binah did as well, and soon, the air grew hot, snuffing out their words. They just sat there, red in the face, enjoying the tea. After they finished, they thanked Hokma for the drinks, stood still for a very awkward five seconds, and hurriedly left. When they returned to their respective floors, they clutched at their heart; It ached... but... they didn't mind it. Gebura slouched down on the sofa, exasperated with herself, while Binah curled up in her bed, trying to get some shuteye.*

  
*Both of them failed to get proper sleep... for this new light; it kept their minds racing. Binah was like a dark angel for Gebura, and Gebura was like a maiden of war for Binah. They couldn't sleep... not.. not without each other. As Binah tossed and turned under the covers, a knock was heard at her door. Binah crept out of bed, and slowly opened the door. Gebura stood before her. She was wearing her pajamas. Night was falling over the Library, and she couldn't sleep.*

  
""Do... do ya mind if I doze off here with ya?"" *Gebura asked bluntly, apparently allergic to eye-contact. Binah invited her inside, and the two nuzzled up into bed with each other. Their eyes met as the weight of the comforters bore down on them... and they began to relax... and shortly afterwards, they drifted off into the realm of the dreaming... together.*

When I tell you, I don’t know the last time I felt my heart sank as much as it did near the end of the taping. We were at the end of the taping when it got announced that Jimmy Kimmel Live was suspended indefinitely. Stephen was the one to drop the news to us. I left the theatre thinking about how tragic it was to see the taping end that way. Stephen truly is as nice as a boss can get. He was messing around with everyone and his staff members between takes and smiling and getting into the music like any person would be nice to go out for a coffee with would. I am never going to forget the moment that I watched him react to the headline about Kimmel. He was handed a phone by one of the staff members and paused for a second, propped his legs up on his desk like he was about to tell a joke. Then, he lifted his hand to his mouth like he couldn’t believe something, and I knew that something was wrong. Nothing could have prepared me for the announcement about Kimmel. We all were shocked and frightened. It was like all Stephen’s happiness during that taping disappeared. We even had to pause the taping for like five minutes so Stephen could figure out what was going on and call Kimmel. Even the band looked worried. He came back and said he couldn’t figure out what was happening, did the closing goodbye clip, and left the stage IMMEDIATELY and didn’t come back. It was so fun before then, and I just left the theatre sad. It truly was terrifying being in the room when that happened. Free speech is going away and I watched a man react to one of his best friend’s lose almost everything he worked for. It was heartbreaking. Best wishes to Kimmel, Guillermo and his team.

Surviving the Apocalypse as a Zombie


Chapter 1 Warning Message


Three minutes from now, the people around you will turn into zombies.

Upon receiving the text message, Maura Moore's initial reaction was one of disbelief. It was a recent popular internet joke, a script played out by many bloggers who wrote about the apocalypse. Without missing a beat, she replied: Is that you, Jana? Or is it Yvett? Are you messing with me? It's not April Fool's Day today.

No sooner had she sent the message than the lights overhead flickered, causing her heart to leap in her chest.

Rita Lupton, a colleague sitting nearby, couldn't help but look up. “Hmm, that's odd. When was the last time we had a power outage in Kheawood? What's going on?”

Maura was a twenty-two-year-old intern at an internet company, where working overtime was the norm. It was six in the evening, and, being early winter, darkness had already fully descended. It seemed as though rain was on the horizon, with the branches outside the window swaying faintly in the gloom.

Like the shadowy beasts of the dark fairy tales, baring their fangs and claws, ready to drag people into the abyss.

Maura had always considered herself brave, but when Rita from the neighboring workstation turned to look at her, Maura couldn't help but feel a jolt of fear. Rita's face was pale, and her eyes were rigid, a sight that was truly unnerving. Maura's gaze drifted downward, only to find that the edges of Rita's nails were also turning a ghastly shade of blue.

Rita seemed to find Maura's daydreaming rather odd, moving closer with a hint of concern. “Maura, what's got you so distracted? Be careful, or the director might scold you again.”

The overpowering stench of decay nearly made Maura retch, causing her to abruptly stand up.

The other colleagues in the office also looked up. Everyone was unsure of what was wrong with her.

Maura was noticeably nervous as she swallowed hard, starting to gather her things in preparation to leave. “I'm not feeling well, so I'll head home first. Rita, could you please inform the director about my absence for me?”

After she finished speaking, she quickly grabbed her bag and headed toward the door. She indeed looked a bit off-color.

Rita, who was behind her, seemed utterly confused, wondering aloud, “Why did you suddenly feel unwell out of nowhere? Young people these days are just too pampered. I got bitten by a dog yesterday, got a rabies shot, and yet here I am, still at work. You better watch out. The director might get angry and fire you!”

Upon hearing the final sentence, Maura had already reached the office door. “So be it! I quit!”

Her heart was pounding heavily.

After leaving the office, she glanced at her phone messages. Two minutes had already passed since she received the text. Thankfully, the company wasn't located on a high floor; it was situated on the third floor. After a moment of contemplation, she quickly descended the stairs.

One should never take the elevator when the electrical circuit was unstable. If one ended up trapped inside, it would be disastrous.

She would be a sitting duck.

Maura practically sprinted down the stairs. Just as she reached the bottom of the company building, a piercing scream echoed from above. The passersby around her couldn't help but gasp in shock, their gazes collectively drawn upward.

“Damn, that scared the crap out of me!”

“What's going on? Don't tell me the work stress is getting too much, and someone is thinking of jumping off a building again?”

“Yikes, that was terrifying. Let's get out of here, quick!”

...

Upon hearing the scream, Maura's hands started shaking. She glanced at her phone. Precisely three minutes had passed. She didn't dare to lift her head as she quickly swiped her card and left the technology park.

Once she left the office area, she immediately scanned the code to rent a bike and hurried home, not daring to linger any longer.

She no longer dared to take public transportation.

She hadn't received any new messages, and the cellphone tower signal was sporadically disappearing.

She wanted to send messages to her friends, warning them of the impending danger. But when not a single one could be sent, she knew the world was truly in trouble.

At this point, a storm was brewing.

She rode her bike at a high speed. Thankfully, everyone she passed by behaved normally.

Twenty minutes later, she successfully arrived at the residential area, which somewhat put Maura at ease. She didn't waste any time, and before heading up to her apartment, she stepped into the largest supermarket at the entrance of the residential area. Casually pulling a shopping cart, she began her major shopping spree.

Milk, bread, instant pasta, chocolate, along with a variety of beverages that were high in sweetness and calories.

At that moment, she was largely disoriented, her nerves taut with tension. Her actions were entirely driven by subconscious decisions, guided by her instinct to survive.

After she filled up an entire cart, the stock clerk, Hazel, suddenly expressed her concern, “Young lady, what happened? You don't seem to be in a good state! Are you upset? Why didn't you work overtime today?”

Maura often came to shop after work in the evenings, so the supermarket staff were quite familiar with her.

“Ah, well, I was feeling down, so I decided to have a big meal,” she said.

It seemed as though Maura had just awoken from a daze. She managed a strained smile as she asked Hazel, “By the way, don't you offer delivery service here? Could you help me deliver ten boxes of mineral water? Just drop them off at the eighth floor of Building A. Leaving them in the elevator would be fine.”

Upon hearing the request, Hazel readily agreed, but couldn't help expressing her curiosity, “Why would a young woman like you buy so much bottled water? It would probably take you ages to finish them!”

Maura was stuffing all sorts of canned food into her shopping cart. As she did so, she replied, “I can't be bothered to shop all the time. I got fired from my job today, so starting from tomorrow, I'll be busy looking for work. I won't have time to come back for groceries.”

Upon hearing this, Hazel immediately sighed. “Young people these days are under such tremendous pressure. All right, I'll prepare your bill in a bit, then you can come over to pay. How can a young lady like you constantly consume such junk food? Even if you're in a bad mood, you can't just binge eat and drink like this. It's really harmful to your stomach, you know?”

Upon hearing these caring words, Maura's heart ached. She had been adopted and brought home by an elderly couple. After they passed away and their house was demolished, she had moved here less than a year ago. To be cared for so deeply by a stranger all of a sudden was truly heart-wrenching.

She opened her mouth again and again, but still couldn't bring herself to tell Hazel about the zombie incident.

After all, she didn't have enough evidence to prove that the end of the world and zombies were actually coming.

So, she silently followed Hazel to pay for her items. The kind lady even helped her carefully pack her purchases and accompanied her all the way to the elevator.

Maura hauled up the emergency supplies and ten boxes of bottled water that she had purchased. As the elevator doors closed, she could still hear the security guard casually chatting with Hazel.

“Oh, Hazel. Here delivering goods again? How come this young lady bought so much?”

“The poor woman is in a bad mood after being fired from her job. Says she needs to start job hunting from tomorrow and can't be bothered to keep purchasing bottled water all the time. Young people these days tend to cope with stress by shopping excessively, unlike us older folks who've lived through tougher times, right?”

“Hahaha, that's true.”

After that, Maura couldn't hear anything else. Having reached the eighth floor, she quickly moved her stuff out, then shut the elevator doors before moving everything back to her house. It was only upon returning to this familiar place that she felt somewhat at ease.

She collapsed onto the couch. The overhead light was glaring down at her, so all she could do was close her eyes and attempt to regain her composure, catching her breath in the process. She intended to sort through the pile of supplies by the door later, but something felt off as soon as she closed her eyes.

It was as if she were suddenly experiencing an illusion. With her eyes closed, she could see a Rubik's Cube. However, this was no ordinary cube; it was multifaceted, with countless sides densely packed together.

It was whirling at high speed.

Maura abruptly started retching, completely disoriented by the rapid spinning.


Chapter 2 The Multifaceted Space


She was no stranger to the internet, often interacting with it, and was familiar with online novels. The term “apocalypse” was often associated with the concept of storage space. Thus, through her experimentation, she discovered that this cube was indeed a dimensional storage! This discovery left her with mixed feelings of joy and sorrow.

The joy was in gaining a massive storage space, but the sorrow lay in the realization that the world was truly out of sorts.

Once she regained her senses, the Rubik's Cube ceased to spin, as if its initial spinning was merely a startup ritual.

The dimensional storage cube was now still in the sea of her consciousness, all peaceful and quiet.

After a while, Maura finally managed to regain her composure.

No longer feeling dizzy, she rose and moved toward the window, her gaze falling on the people strolling below. Unaware of what the future held, they carried on as they would on any ordinary day.

Some people were in a rush just after finishing work, while others were out for a stroll with their families after dinner.

Every now and then, delivery drivers would bustle back and forth.

The streetlights bathed everything in a soft halo, casting an aura of extreme bliss. It was an utterly ordinary evening, leaving her to wonder if such moments could ever be witnessed again in the future.

She had been on edge for quite some time. Subsequently, she drew the curtains and swiftly stowed away all the supplies at the door into the storage space. Indeed, it was very convenient.

Turning around, she opened the door on the right side of the entrance. It was a storage room. Inside were three massive shelves and a large freezer.

Thanks to the outbreak of the epidemic, during the lockdown in the neighborhood, there was a scarcity of food and drink.

Maura was quite the survival enthusiast, and as such, she had a penchant for stockpiling food. After the epidemic ended, her desire to hoard only grew stronger.

That was why she had such a well-stocked pantry, filled with canned goods that had a shelf life of up to ten years. There were a total of twenty boxes, each filled with various types of canned food.

There was a mix of both meat and vegetables.

In addition to ten boxes of assorted flavored compressed biscuits and ten boxes of high-calorie energy bars, there were also five huge bags of pasta. A variety of instant foods and self-heating meals were also available. Even mineral water was well-stocked, with ten boxes at the ready.

As for perishable items like milk and vegetables, she would occasionally replenish them in her usual routine.

There was still quite a lot left in the large kitchen refrigerator.

The storage room held a variety of condiments as well. Among them, there were three boxes of salt, with the rest divided into several portions for each type, such as ketchup, mustard, vinegar, and so on.

Besides that, she also had survival supplies such as a backpack filled with everything a hardcore survivalist could dream of. It contained numerous handy tools, as well as enough food for one person.

Outside the backpack, there was a chainsaw, a hatchet, and a dagger.

She even had three containers of gasoline.

Primarily, they would be used for generating electricity. In case of a power outage, she also had a domestic generator at her disposal.

Of course, there were also several large boxes of medical supplies. These included items for stopping bleeding, reducing inflammation, relieving pain, and bandaging wounds. There were both oral and topical medications, as well as vitamins.

These were all things Maura typically kept around for her own amusement. However, looking at this storage room now, she couldn't help but feel a mixture of emotions. She truly never thought they would come in handy.

She swiftly stashed all these items into the dimensional storage cube, feeling the connection between her and this space. The reason she could confidently store all her supplies in this space was largely due to this sensation.

There was a sensation of a blood-tied connection. At least when she was still alive, everything would be there, and only she alone could take or put things in.

It gave a strong sense of security.

After emptying the entire storage room, she moved on to the bathroom. There was a large tub in the bathroom that was kept filled with water year-round. After some experimentation, she found that she could store the water directly into one of the spaces on another facet of the cube without needing a container. So she turned on the faucet, planning to transfer the water from the tub into the space periodically.

She planned to fill one of the compartments with water. She estimated that each compartment was roughly 200 cubic meters. This multi-faceted space, reminiscent of a Rubik's Cube, seemed to have countless sides.

She couldn't even keep count!

Maura suddenly felt a lot more at ease. After that, she chose not to venture downstairs to gather more supplies, as the night was always more perilous than the day.

She decided to first observe the changes quietly.

Hence, she decided to have dinner and headed to the kitchen. Despite working at an internet company, she was fortunate enough to have alternating weekends off. Therefore, she would prepare some ready-made meals for herself on weekends and store them in the freezer. When it was time to eat, like now, all she had to do was heat it up in the microwave for three minutes.

And so, a steaming hot plate of pasta bolognese was ready. Maura had also washed a small bowl of fruit, filled with large, eye-protecting blueberries.

In the end, she carried her meal to the coffee table in the living room to enjoy, casually switching on the television as she did. Despite the popularity of projectors among the younger crowd, she maintained a preference for the television. It held a nostalgic charm for her, evoking memories of watching shows with her elderly adoptive parents, a sentiment that brought her comfort.

Upon turning on the television, it was the local news channel that the three of them used to frequently watch.

“Welcome to the latest daily news. This is your reporter, Wendy, bringing you the updates. According to submissions from local residents, a harrowing incident occurred at Hypernet Corporation, located on the third floor of Building B in the technology park's Phase Two. The individual involved was a young woman who was bitten by her colleague, a certain Ms. Lupton. Unfortunately, despite Ms. Lupton having received a rabies vaccination just the previous night, the onset of the disease was alarmingly swift.”

After switching on the television, Maura took a bite of her meal, only to be taken aback by what she heard. She abruptly looked up to see the female reporter in the video, her face filled with regret as she announced the news. Following that, she brought up the issue of having dogs on leashes during walks.

The highlight of this news program was always the latest daily scoop. It provided updates on all the recent happenings within the city each day.

Hence, an event that occurred just after six in the evening could still be promptly reported in the news.

As the reporter provided commentary, a clip from an incident in the office was shown in the top left corner. From the perspective of the person filming, when Rita initially went berserk and bit Alice, the filming colleague, Brynn, was still joking around, saying, “Oh no, Rita's gone mad from working overtime! Hahaha!”

However, Alice then screamed out loud because Rita had bitten her hard enough to draw blood, even tearing a chunk of flesh from her. This horrifying scene caused Brynn, who was filming, to shriek in fear as well. The video that followed was nothing but shaky footage of a frantic escape, filled with blurry images. The mood among the spectators shifted from curiosity to panic.

“Many netizens claim this was a case of a zombie biting someone, but that's actually a rumor. The truth was, Ms. Lupton simply had unusually sharp teeth, which resulted in the person being bitten to the point of severe injury. In order to prevent public panic, everyone is urged not to heedlessly believe in rumors.”

After the reporter finished their final statement, the host took over with a smile and started delivering the closing remarks.

Maura couldn't even eat her meal, her appetite lost after what she had heard. She cast her phone screen onto the television and tried to open the trending page on Twitter. As expected, the incident at her company was indeed the hot topic.

#KheawoodZombie

#EndOfTheWorld

She connected to her home's internet, attempting to refresh the signal several times before it improved slightly.

Meanwhile, as if there was a delay, she suddenly received a barrage of messages.

There were some from Carrie, another of her colleagues.

Carrie: Damn, you sure are blessed with good luck, Maura! The moment you left, Rita went ballistic!

Carrie: Wait, no, it's not that. She just had a rabies episode.

Carrie: Good thing you left quickly!

Carrie had joined the company around the same time as Maura did, with just a day's difference.

Thus, their relationship was decent.

Maura was in no mood to respond to her. She couldn't eat her meal and was breaking out in a cold sweat. It had been a close call, so very close. Had she not left when she did, she would have been the one bitten, as she was the closest to Rita.


Chapter 3 The Beginning Of The End


Luckily, she had believed the text message.

Ding dong!

Her phone vibrated once more, signaling the arrival of a new message. It was from the one who had sent her that warning.

Maura was practically trembling as she sent a message, persistently asking who exactly they were.

The other party blatantly ignored these inquiries; instead, they sent over a download link.

Had it not been for the fact that Rita's situation truly matched up, Maura would not have dared to proceed. Moreover, she had three backup phones, so she wasn't afraid of any viruses. Her bank cards, where she kept her savings, weren't linked to any online banking, so she had no fear of them being fraudulently used.

As a result, she didn't hesitate to tap on the link and download it onto her phone.

Shortly, a post-apocalyptic survival manual popped up. She read through it meticulously, almost word by word. This brief guide, less than three thousand words long, mentioned climate changes, various disasters, and even the chaos that would overtake the world in the later stages.

In addition, there was mention of “mutations.”

That word, written in bold and enlarged red font, was described as a universal upgrade.

Upon reflection, it did make sense.

Without adapting by evolving, no one could possibly survive in such a chaotic world.

Concerned about the possibility of electronic devices becoming unusable in the future, Maura immediately went to her room's desk. She downloaded and printed out numerous copies of this survival manual, then stored them away in the storage space.

By the time she had finished all this, her meal had already cooled. She ate without really tasting the food, not wasting a single drop of sauce. ",1,1758169541.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

1njyr9h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1njyr9h,Why your desk setup might be silently killing your focus,"Most of us underestimate how much our desk affects energy levels. If your desk is too low, you slouch. Too high, your shoulders tense up. Stay seated too long, and your brain fogs.

A standing desk solves this, but not all standing desks are equal. Look for:

* Smooth motorized lift (so you actually use it, not just “set and forget”)  
* Collision + overload protection (nobody wants spilled coffee disasters)  
* Preset height settings (saves you from fiddling 10x a day)  
* Strong build (cheap ones wobble after a few months)  

One desk that checks these boxes is the **OdinLake S450**. Dual motors, **275 lbs** load capacity, crash + heat protection, and a sleek LED keypad with silent mode. It’s designed for people who actually work long hours, not just for aesthetics.

Has anyone else here noticed their **energy spike** when switching between sitting and standing during the day?

We were classmates for 2 years and got separate classrooms after we changed school. I'm an introvert, and she's an extrovert. Because she's been the only one I've been closest to in our new school, I have a lot of trouble finding new friends. I told her about it and she said not to worry, cause will definitely have one. I sorted it out and finally got friends for the past year but, this new school year I got separated with them, but we're still in contact with each other. My new classmates already have their circles when school started, so I felt anxious. But I didn't really worry about it too much cause I thought it will be the same as back then. Now, I finally found new friends, everything was going smoothly for me. One day, my long time friend texted me that she felt left out in their room, she said her friends didn't really made her feel belonged. I was worried, cause she has always been a friend to everyone, a cheerful social butterfly. Then I replied to her the same thing she said to me months ago, ""It'll be fine, you will definitely have friends that you will feel seen being with."" we talked for hours, cause I knew the feeling of longing to have someone who will understand you in times of loneliness. Tomorrow that day, we talked and she told me that her friends noticed her being down, they checked on her and cheered her up. They were now bonded stronger than before. I was relieved. Months passed, but I felt like my friends(they were my friends in my current classroom) and I were starting to grow apart. Since we were seated far apart, and schoolworks kept flooding us, along with the pressure of being an honor student, I was constantly anxious. Then one day, I noticed that they now each had their best friends. But because I am the type of person who doesn't wanna fit/push/insert myself in to a friend group(this was probably my toxic trait, cause I would rather be alone than to become the last/second option), I was left alone. My loneliness was covered up by my introvertedness. I was burntout. I dont have the energy to do anything at all. We were returning home from school. (I haven't mentioned this, but my long time friend and I have been going home together for almost 3 months now) along with my long time friend and her friends. I had initially planned to tell my long time friend about my current situation inside my classroom. But I don't wanna ruin their happy time together since they still wanna have coffee and chill, at the same time, I was kind of annoyed on how energetic they were(I know this isn't a good thing). Tbh, I was also kind of disappointed in my long time friend that she didn't really asked me on how I was feeling since I've been down that time(but I try not to really show it so that they can still enjoy). All those feelings have been pent up and I just felt like I was about to burst out, I was so uncomfortable. So I told her that I need to go home, but she insisted that she will go home with me if I leave. But we just arrived at the coffee shop, and her friends were having a good time with her, so I told her to stay and left(I didn't realize that I have been rude in the way I left in that moment cause I just didn't understand everything I've been feeling that time). I walked out but she followed me moments later, we went home together and didn't really chat. Later that evening, I have calmed down and jokingly told her that her friends might've had been frightened/offended on how I acted(the way we talk to each other has always been goofy) she said yeah, they asked ""is this how she sulk?"" and I asked for apology after. Tomorrow that day, I got out of school and texted her if she still wanna go home together but she replied that they were still busy with their girlscouts event(yet my classmates who also joined the girlscouts already left home. But I didn't really mind) so I once again, jokingly told her that they might've had been avoiding me for what I did yesterday, she just laughed and said that wasn't the case, but I still apologized about in once more, and told her that it wasn't their fault. She didn't reply up until now, I was not really worried about it till now since we've already talked about what could end our friendship and something like this isn't really enough for a quarell cause we've been through worse. But knowing that she didn't reply till now made me think about everything. I only wanted someone to listen to me, and this situation is what I got. What should I do in this situation?(I was also kind of traumatized by this same thing before cause I had also broke my friendship with my bestfriend when I was in junior high for a really stupid reason and I don't know what to do this time).

1njyq2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1njyq2u/frozen_milk/,Frozen milk?,"So just as a premise, I cook for two ngo charities, one for the homeless, one for suicide prevention.  

Our main food supplier is a regional NGO that receives all the unsold products, dinged cans, “on special” special meats from across the local groceries and farmers - I usually manage just fine and make really good meals out of everything I get.

One thing I can’t get used to just yet is how to handle frozen milk, and milk products.   

When we give a carton of frozen 2% to a homeless person, I know they’ll just toss it out after they realize how it clumps down at the bottom after the main chunk of ice separates from the fats.

A few weeks ago we received 15 full cases of frozen milk.  (Cardboard banana cases full) - we had to toss the whole thing because A) Nobody likes frozen milk.  Nobody.  B) we have neither space nor use for any of it.? 
C) When I try to thaw it out to use for desserts, or for our users’ coffee, it always takes forever in the sink with lukewarm water, with still pretty shitty results.  D) The company we receive it from promises they freeze the milk within 2 days of the expiry date.

I’m ranting, but also trying to find solutions for this.

My artist said the tattoo would be about a two hour job for a medium piece on my inner forearm, mostly line work.

Go in feeling confident, artist is nice and accommodating to a newbie, shows me the stencil, looks great then we get to the job.

The actual needle didn't hurt as much as I thought, more of an annoying feeling but still a little painful, about 5-10 mins in I start feeling drowsy, I passed out and the artist tells me to lay down and breath for a minute; we start back again and this time focus on my breathing, another 5-ish mins pass and it happens again only this time I wake up to find I had puked.

Understandably, the session ended there with only maybe 5% of the tattoo done, he was being super nice about it making sure im fine, he told me to message him next week to set up a new session but wants to wait a month for what was already done to heal and to assess future work.

Is this normal for these kinds of situations? I guess I'm just feeling bad about because I have to wait another month just to hopefully finish it and that nerves gave me a really bad first session.

I had been told by friends afterwards that I should have eaten more and had more water, plus had some snacks/sugary things, which I agree, I didn't have much food outside of some pizza pops, a doughnut and some coffee.

Am I over thinking things? I could use some advice.",1,1758169312.0,tattooadvice,4,1.0,False
