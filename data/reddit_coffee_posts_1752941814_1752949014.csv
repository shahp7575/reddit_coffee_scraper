I have tried dating multiple people at the same time (with their knowledge, of course) but I truly believe it's not for me. All respect to those who swear by it - I'm just not built for it, I guess. Give me a slow, steady, but sure path to choosing each other every day. Give me mindful building of mutual trust and respect. 

 About Me:
- 5'5
- Glasses, dyed hair, bi 
- Working professional for way too long
- My friends say I'm charming, cheerful, and good company :) 
- A lot of geeky interests that we can talk about, from video games to comic books, movies, pop culture and TV 
- Pretty dark sense of humor, my meme algo can be a bit out there haha 
- Enjoys going on road trips, traveling, or even keeping it local and  discovering new coffee shops nearby
- Loves love and is looking for the other half of my soul

About You:

1m42zdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/askaplumber/comments/1m42zdz/running_water_to_detached_garage/,Running water to detached garage,"Hey folks, I am in south Michigan and I'm building a detached garage. It's a 32x48 pole barn with 6"" posts, 5/8"" OSB sheeting, and vinyl siding. The inside will be insulated. The dirt floor is being prepped and will have 2"" foam board with 1/2 PEX for radiant floor heat, and a 6"" slab. There will also be insulation around the sides of the slab, so around the poles and against the skirt board. I would like to have water in there so I can have a sink and a coffee maker. I have a well and the pump is in the basement of the house so I have easy access to all the plumbing. The run from the outside wall of the basement to where it enters the garage is ~45 feet. I'll have to look it up to confirm but I believe I need to be 12"" below the frost line so 54"" total.   Is there a certain distance from the inside of the OSB I need to come up? Like right against it or at half the post thickness? Should I run PEX? I would run it in conduit to protect it. I also need to run electrical and will have an extra conduit for possible future upgrades. I think I can run those in the same trench but at 18"" deep, or deeper as long as it's far enough away from the water line. The well pressure is only a little over 40 psi. It seems to be enough for the house, although the outside spigot is barely 40. Maybe I need someone check that out. 
I initially thought of running skirt board on the inside of the posts so I have that space between the two to run conduit and have easy access, but I was told I should run concrete against the outside skirt instead so he poles are locked in. Hence I need to make sure I have conduit in place before the pour. 
So questions: 
-PEX or something else from basement to garage? 
-Anything specific to look for before burying it? Obviously I'll make sure there's no rocks touching it.
-I get that the waterline is protected from frost when it's this deep, but how is it protected when it runs up and through the floor? 
- What else should I do while I'm digging? Anything?

1m42yyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1m42yyd/he_keeps_using_my_desk_chair_because_it_has/,He keeps using my desk chair because it has ‚Äòbetter vibes',"This has been going on for weeks and I genuinely cannot tell if I‚Äôm being messed with or if this man is just that deep into delusion. I‚Äôm 25F and work in a fairly casual office with assigned desks. Everyone has their own chair, their own setup, nothing fancy. Mine happens to be one of the slightly newer ones, but nothing wild. Just a standard ergonomic office chair with a mesh back.

Enter Mark. Mark is a mid-thirties guy on a different team who sits two rows over. A month ago, I walked into work and found him sitting in my chair. At my desk. No explanation. I asked what was up and he said, ‚ÄúOh, I just needed a second to reset. Your chair has better vibes.‚Äù

I laughed, assuming he was joking. He wasn‚Äôt.

Since then, he‚Äôs made a habit of wandering over every morning before I arrive and settling into my chair. Sometimes with coffee. Sometimes scrolling on his phone. One time he had already opened his laptop on my desk. When I confront him, he stands up and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done channeling. Thanks.‚Äù I swear he means it.

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôve started coming in earlier just to beat him to it. That worked exactly two days. Then he started showing up even earlier. I asked why he doesn‚Äôt just switch chairs permanently if he loves it so much and he said, ‚ÄúIt only works in that spot. I tried. The energy‚Äôs off.‚Äù

I told our office manager and she kind of laughed it off like, ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs just Mark being Mark.‚Äù But it‚Äôs genuinely messing with my space. I feel like I‚Äôm in some weird chair custody battle. Do I escalate or just start bringing in my own camping chair like a weirdo?

And said, ""Wow. My domestic king.‚Äù

  
Then she plopped down beside me, fed me snacks, and put on my favorite show like I just won the Super Bowl.

I may never move again.

1m42yhx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m42yhx,Q Air ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Started brewing 3 months back, and never knew this would grow on me, 

Yes i agree because of cultural integration, i am still on lattes and what not, but maybe because I am yet to try a fruity, funky coffee at range of 1:16 17 and maybe, that will make me change, for now moka pot  is not the correct way of trying and appreciating that...

Since Past 3 weeks i was thinking of owning a grinder, and then i thought maybe its too early? And i used to contradict myself everyday if I should get one or not ....

Fast forward to almost like 10 days back, i placed an initial order for c2 at 3.8k, I panicked and cancelled my order. Thats when over thought and thought about grinder every single day atleast ones.  

Now there was only one way of finding if grinder was my thing or if i will turn back to pre ground from grinder. Turning back from C2 or anything expensive wouldn't have made as much sense as turning back from a cheap grinder would have.

So after thinking a lot, after 3 days .. i ordered Agaro elite manual grinder for i guess 1018 from BigBasket. I was happy, now only one issue, i didn't want experiment expensive beans or blend that i might have messed hence I bought fraction9 everyday Gold. 

Then another 5 days later my coffee came...
Brewed my first cup, failed ... Second cup failed ... 
Third cup was when i got something close to how i have been getting from pre ground.

Now don't get me wrong... Who is this agaro elite manual grinder for?
For someone who isn't sure if he will continue beans or move back to pre ground for any xyz reason. Or someone on Extremely tight budget on a soft launch check if grinder is what he was missing. Would definitely work best with a French Press but Moka pot, being medium fine grind was definitely a little hard for this baby Agaro grinder...

3 days back, i remember how few weeeks back i cancelled my order for c2 at 3.8k and look how i spent a little less than double on this 1zpresso Q air,  and for the most initial impression bitterness has certainly reduced a bit.

Pic 2: fines from Q air after grinder

Feels normal here. But something odd happened recently in NYC that made me think.

Saw a guy who looked Indian at a coffee shop, so I smiled and said hi. Instead of being chill, he gave me this ‚Äúwho the hell are you‚Äù look and responded pretty arrogantly, talking about his startup and how much he‚Äôs raised. Honestly, he acted like I was below him.

Here‚Äôs the best part turned out his last funding came from a VC firm where I‚Äôm actually an LP/angel investor, and the partner is a good friend. When he realized, his energy immediately changed. Awkward doesn‚Äôt even cover it.

Why is it that a lot of Indians abroad act like this with each other? Like, would it kill us to just be nice or at least not look down on someone? But put the same guy in front of a white person and he‚Äôd probably be all smiles and manners.

Not sure what it is ego, insecurity, or just a bad habit. But honestly, it sucks.

Anyone else experience this? Is it just me?

But, I personally use coffee scoops for my (whole) beans when measuring them out rather than pouring them out of the bag because it is less messy to me. I hate seeing useful accessories slowly removed from products overtime (RIP Aeropress filter holder and funnels). I also appreciate the included scoop being plastic because they're way less scratchy and easier on my equipment when I use them/bang them against stuff compared to metal spoons. I've used an Aeropress scoop for a long time, but I recently found myself needing an entirely new filter coffee set for making coffee at another place. So, a new scoop was needed and honestly a reason that helped motivate me to get this set rather than a V60 and carafe separately. On Amazon, it said the scoop was included when I bought it. When I got my package, I noticed that the scoop wasn't included. It also wasn't listed on the box as included. I checked the Hario USA website and noticed that it's no longer listed in the set. Obviously, I can source my own plastic spoon (and I have). But, what gives?

It's finally time to upgrade! Nowadays I make my coffee by filling up a reusable Nespresso cup with proper quality beans which I grinded with my comandante c40.

I usually drink lungo's made with light roasted beans (fruity), my wife however is more of a cappuccino/ latte macchiato drinker.

I went to a few stores within the neighbourhood (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and they all told me basically the same thing ""don't buy a machine you can buy at a non coffee store."" Refering to Delongi, sage, Solis. They all make good coffee, but not splendid coffee. 

And so I ended up with two brands in mind, quickmill (either the 820 or a second hand 3000/3035) and lelit (the Anna)

Is there a better choice between these machines? Or is there maybe a complete different better choice?

Platoon Commander of 24th Battalion ""Aidar"" Stanislav Bunyatov wrote:

*I want to remind those who applaud such populist statements that the absence of clear service terms is one of the main reasons for the demotivation of personnel and the general unwillingness to join the Armed Forces.*

*Thank you, Mr. President, for supporting the military.*

Military community Rozvidka Noem:

*I'm pissed off by their dumb\*\*\* slogan: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll defeat Putin ‚Äî and then go home.‚Äù*

*Sure, guys, it‚Äôs all good for you ‚Äî home in the evening, arms around your wife, watching a movie, brushing your teeth in the morning, grabbing a coffee, maybe going to the seaside or taking a vacation somewhere ‚Äî life‚Äôs easy for you.*

*AND WHY THE F\*\*\* SHOULD I OR MY BROTHERS BE PLAYED AWAY IN A CARD GAME FOR LIFE?*

*Are you still living in the 2019 war? The war has long since changed. The conditions we have now are 500 times worse, and no pathetic 30 days a year will fix them.*

*You wouldn‚Äôt survive a single day in the conditions that the average Mykola handles for months on end.*

*Your elephant-sized excuses show a complete disregard for the Ukrainian soldier. None of you has even thought about alternatives: longer leaves, rehabilitation, decompression. If you‚Äôve served half a year non-stop ‚Äî you should get 3 months at home to rest.*

*Why the f\*\*\* should we be played away in a card game since February 2022? Not enough people? That‚Äôs not our problem! Why should we carry the label of ‚Äú1 for 5‚Äù when it‚Äôs your fault there aren‚Äôt enough people, not ours?*

*We have carried, and are carrying, our burden honestly and faithfully, and you bastards aren‚Äôt even trying to think how to make our lives better.*

*One more time: The current ‚Äúrest‚Äù conditions in the Armed Forces are standards that were appropriate in 2021. Today, offering such pathetic leave in exchange for superhuman work is an outright crime against your own defenders.*

*We wish that every one of you who doesn‚Äôt give a f\*\*\* about the Ukrainian soldier would feel the burden that the Ukrainian infantryman carries every single day.*

1m42oi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m42oi5/and_so_i_watch_you_from_afar/,And so I watch you from afar,"It started, as these things often do, with a simple noticing. A new tenant in the apartment across the courtyard. 4C. The one with the large window facing mine, framed by those slightly-too-short, gauzy curtains that never quite closed properly. You moved in on a Tuesday, hauling boxes that seemed too heavy for your frame. I remember how you looked on that Tuesday. Delicate bones beneath the effort, dark hair escaping the style you had been aiming for that hasteful morning, a few strands stuck to your temple with sweat. I was busy watering the small houseplant on my balcony. You glanced up, caught my eye, offered a quick, breathless smile. I smiled back.

That was all it took.

It wasn‚Äôt love at first sight. That‚Äôs just a lie people tell themselves to justify the inconvenient. No, it was curiosity. A spark that caught dry tinder in my soul I hadn‚Äôt even know was there. Who were you? Where did you come from? What made your eyes widen slightly when you looked at the city skyline from your balcony, like you were both thrilled and terrified? I had to know.

At first, it was casual. Glances while washing dishes. Noting your schedule. You left for work early, always rushing, coffee mug steaming in your hand. You came home late, shoulders slumped, sometimes carrying grocery bags that looked like they might split. You rarely drew your curtains fully at night. A slice of your life was perpetually on display: the warm glow of your lamp as you read on the faded blue couch, the flicker of your television as it painted shifting colours on the wall, the silhouette of you moving through the rooms ‚Äì brushing your hair, putting things away, standing still for moments at the window, looking out at the world beyond your little kingdom.

*Looking out.* But never, I noted with a strange mixture of disappointment and satisfaction, never really *seeing*.

I learned your routines. Mondays and Thursdays, yoga at 7 PM. You‚Äôd unroll a purple mat in the living room space visible from my vantage point. Sunday was laundry day. You hung things carefully on the small drying rack on your balcony. Practical cotton underwear, soft-looking t-shirts, one particular oversized grey sweater you seemed fond of. I was fond of it too. I noticed the brand of your detergent. Fresh linen. Clean.

I learned your loneliness. The way you‚Äôd sometimes sit on the sofa, phone in hand, staring at it for long minutes before putting it down without making a call. The way you always cooked single portions. The way you‚Äôd sometimes cry, shoulders shaking silently in the lamplight, face buried in your hands. I wanted to‚Ä¶ not comfort you, exactly. To acknowledge it, I think. To let you know someone saw the weight you carried. But distance was my ally. Distance was my shield.

I learned your small joys, too. The way you danced badly, wonderfully, when a particular song came on while you cooked. The way you‚Äôd curl up with a book and a mug of something steaming, completely absorbed. The way sunlight caught the gold flecks in your brown eyes when you stepped onto the balcony in the morning ‚Äì a detail visible only through my binoculars. Yes, binoculars. Birdwatching, I told myself. Urban birdwatching. And you were the most fascinating specimen of them all.

The more I watched, the more I knew you. Better than anyone else ever could. I knew you hated the shrill alarm on your phone; you‚Äôd smack it like it offended you personally. I knew you bit your lower lip when concentrating. I knew you favoured your left ankle slightly, an old injury perhaps. I knew the exact shade of pink that flushed your cheeks in the cold.

I knew you were vulnerable.

The courtyard between us became a sacred space, a theatre where your life unfolded just for me. The other apartments blurred into the background noise of the building. Only you mattered. Only your light in the darkness across from me. My own apartment felt like it receded, became merely a viewing platform, a nest. My life outside you ceased to hold meaning. Work became a tedious interruption between observations. Friends‚Äô voices became a drone I tuned out, impatient to get back to my window, to my vigil.

Do you understand? I wasn‚Äôt a monster. I wasn‚Äôt lurking in bushes or breathing down your neck. I was present. A constant, unseen guardian. I watched out for you. That man who lingered near the mailboxes a little too long a month ago? I noted his face, his build. I timed how long he stayed. Ready. Always ready. Because I knew your patterns. I knew when you were due home. If he‚Äôd made a move towards you as you rounded the corner, weighed down with shopping bags, I‚Äôd have tracked him down to the ends of the earth if I had to. I‚Äôd have taken a pair of pliers and pulled every tooth in his sick skull. I‚Äôd have cut out his tongue. I‚Äôd get a hammer and shatter every single finger on his hands. I‚Äôd have gotten my hands on a gun, and shot him in the kneecaps. No vital organs. Just pure pain. Then I‚Äôd have ripped out his fingernails and stabbed his eyes and then I‚Äôd have put a bullet in his brain.

He left before you arrived back home. But I was *watching*. Keeping you safe.

My presence was a gift. A silent devotion. I curated your privacy by observing it so minutely. I saw the *real* you, the unguarded moments no one else was privileged to witness. Didn‚Äôt that intimacy, however one-sided, create a bond? A deeper connection than the superficial chats you might have with someone in the elevator?

Of course, there were escalations. Necessary ones. To understand you fully. Your Wi-Fi password was easy to guess ‚Äì your cat‚Äôs name followed by your birth year, gleaned from a discarded envelope in the recycling dumpster I checked one collection day. All of a sudden, your digital life opened like a flower in bloom. Your Amazon orders. Your tentative messages to an old friend that always seemed to fizzle out. Your hesitant searches for therapists in the area. Your playlists, full of melancholic indie and folk that perfectly soundtracked my observations.

It wasn‚Äôt spying. It was‚Ä¶ context. Filling in the beautiful, intricate details of the painting I was gazing upon.

Then came the day you brought *him* home.

A Friday night. You were dressed differently. Brighter. Nervous energy crackled around you even from across the courtyard. He was tall, with loud laughter that carried faintly across the space, hands that lingered too familiarly on your arm as you unlocked your door. My blood turned to ice. Who was he? What right did he have?

I watched, rigid at my post, binoculars forgotten on the table beside me, my naked eyes straining through the dusk. I saw the bottle of wine opened. I saw you sitting close on the couch, his arm draped around you. I saw you lean in for a kiss.

I turned away. The betrayal was physical, a punch to the gut. How could you? After the silent communion we shared? This, this interloper. This *stranger*. He didn‚Äôt know you. Not like I did. He didn‚Äôt see the way your fingers trembled slightly when you were anxious. He didn‚Äôt know about the scar just below your left collarbone, visible when you wore that loose tank top. He hadn‚Äôt witnessed your silent tears or your terrible, wonderful dancing.

He stayed the night.

I didn‚Äôt sleep. I sat in the dark, the only light in the dim, mocking glow coming from your window. I listened to the muffled sounds of the city, straining to hear anything from your apartment. Silence. Then, finally, the soft click of your door closing as he left early the next morning. You stood in the doorway, wrapped in a robe, watching him go. You looked satisfied.

That was the day the distance became unbearable. Watching wasn‚Äôt enough. I needed proximity. I needed you to feel the weight of my observation, to understand the depth of my commitment.

It was surprisingly straightforward. Your building‚Äôs main door lock was faulty. A simple credit slipped in just right, and I was in. The stairwell smelled of dust and mould. Your door, 4C, felt warm under my fingertips. I didn‚Äôt go in. Not then. That would be crude. A violation. Instead, I pressed my ear against the wood. I heard the soft clatter of dishes from within. The murmur of your radio. The sound of your breath, just on the other side of the thin barrier. You never said anything, but that was fine. I would take your silence over anyone else‚Äôs voice.

Later, I found something better. A loose floorboard in the poorly lit hallway alcove near the fire escape. A perfect hiding spot. I could be closer. I could listen. I could wait.

I started leaving things. Small things. Innocuous. A single, perfect white pebble outside your door. A sprig of lavender tucked into the frame of your mailbox out in the courtyard. A postcard of a place I thought you‚Äôd like ‚Äì a quiet seaside town. It was left blank. No message needed. You‚Äôd understand it was from someone who *knew*. Someone who cared.

But you didn‚Äôt understand. I saw the confusion on your face when you found the pebble. The slight frown at the lavender. The way you glanced around the hallway after finding the postcard, a flicker of unease in your eyes before you shrugged it off. You were missing the point. The *intimacy*.

The frustration grew. The distance mocked me. I needed a gesture you couldn‚Äôt ignore. Something that spoke of my profound connection to your essence.

I waited for you to go to bed. I knew you‚Äôd be asleep fast. I chose your yoga night; I knew you were always so tired those nights. The faulty main door yielded again and I went up the stairs. Then I picked your lock.

Stepping into your apartment was like stepping into a sacred chapel. It smelled like you ‚Äì that clean linen detergent, faint perfume, the ghost of coffee. Your presence was thick in the air. I‚Äôd journeyed far and wide to this domain. Voyaged across stairwells that formed mountains and marshes of trash and knocked down doors and climbed in windows and listened, listened, listened, and now here I was in your apartment. There was a universe in that room, and in contrast it made me feel like a scrounger of toilets, a pillage of tombs. I moved silently, a shadow among your shadows. I saw the book you were reading on the arm of the couch. The half-empty mug on the coffee table. The grey sweater draped over a chair.

My heart hammered, a frantic percussion against my ribs. Not with fear, but with reverence. And possession.

I didn‚Äôt touch much. Just one thing. From the small, carved box on your dresser where I knew you kept your jewellery. A single strand of your dark hair, caught in a tangle. I slipped it into the tiny glass vial I‚Äôd brought in my back pocket, just in case.

A relic.

A tangible piece of you.

As I retreated, I saw it. Your hairbrush on the bathroom counter. Filled with strands of dark hair. I knew what I was supposed to do. My offering. My proof. I carefully removed all the hair from the brush, leaving it starkly clean. In its place, I left the glass vial containing the single strand. Centred perfectly on the cool porcelain.

*‚ÄúSee?‚Äù* I thought, melting back into the hallway, the faulty door clicking shut softly behind me. *‚ÄúSee how close I can get? See how well I know your space, your solitude?‚Äù*

I returned to my window across the courtyard. Minutes later, you woke up. I saw the lights come on and saw you groggily drift to the bathroom. Saw you stop dead in the doorway. Saw you pick up the vial. Saw the colour drain from your face as you stared at it. Saw you spin around, looking wildly around your apartment, then rushing to your window, peering out into the darkness, your eyes wide with dawning, terrified comprehension.

You looked right towards my building. Right towards my dark window.

You couldn‚Äôt see me, of course. I am very good at being unseen. But you *felt* it now, didn‚Äôt you? The weight. The constant, patient presence. The utter lack of distance that truly mattered.

A slow, overjoyed smile touched my lips. There it was. That connection, finally acknowledged. The fear was regrettable, but necessary. It was the first real emotion you‚Äôd ever truly directed towards me. Raw. Unfiltered. Beautiful in its own patchwork way.

You clutched the vial like a talisman against the evil eye, backing away from your window, quickly drawing those inadequate curtains tight. But it was too late. The veil was torn.

You‚Äôll call the police, probably. They‚Äôll come. They‚Äôll ask questions. They might even patrol for a night or two. But they won‚Äôt find anything. I am careful. I am the man who blends in. The quiet neighbour. The one who keeps to himself. They‚Äôll tell you to get better locks, maybe an alarm. They‚Äôll say it was probably just kids, just a prank. They‚Äôll leave.

And you‚Äôll sit in your apartment, heart pounding, jumping at every creak, constantly checking the locks, peering fearfully out through gaps in the curtains. You‚Äôll feel it. That prickle on the back of your neck. The certainty that somewhere in the darkness, unseen, unblinking eyes are fixed upon you.

You‚Äôll know, deep in your bones, that you are not alone. That you never really were.

Because I am here. Observing. Understanding. Existing. Closer than you can possibly imagine.

And so, I watch you from afar.",1,1752948071.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

For as long as Christina Ricci‚Äô a forty five year old brown eyed, dark haired girl! Having the attitude to match! Her gothic charm, that was about her! For as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. As she then in her mind, saw from deep within the fog and shadows! A man lurking! As he just stood there all dressed up long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee! Just standing there looking over to her. As he then said to Christina‚Äô 

‚ÄúWhy go ahead my dear, and you just say the words! And we shall go from there.‚Äù

As he then just vanished back into the foggy night! Leaving Christina‚Äô even more curious more than ever now. Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair! Knowing that she had always been surrounded by their presence alone. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them.

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person, while at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex! Or just finding herself hanging out with them. Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her, that fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say. Or at least one can try to say, But, Legend has it that on that day in 1849‚Äô when after five days that when they first found him! Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe‚Äô

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown, But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one, Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

‚ÄúWho Killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äô‚Äù

That they just might find out!

But as Christina‚Äô stood there hearing the sounds of darkness all around her, along with the sounds of the Raven‚Äô

Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her! With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer, The same figure was now standing there! Up underneath the street light. 

Standing there as the sounds of a Raven‚Äô Could be heard as it flew by her, as if it was beckoning for her to come. To be and be with him, as Christina‚Äô just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat! Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him! 

As he just stood there directly in front of her! Hearing the sounds of the Raven‚Äô calling out her name. As the darkness grew even around her, But as quickly as he had come,  He was now once more hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina‚Äô now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone, But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe‚Äô

As Christina‚Äô could hear the Raven‚Äô crowing into the nights air. With her just standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night! Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her. One more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her, Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for. As her heart was pounding for more, knowing that once with him! Just wasn‚Äôt enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself, If she really even cared! For they had made their own choice in doing this. But regardless it was Five days, that she will never forget, 

For they will be Never More for her to know.

Never more to know him, And that just wasn‚Äôt good enough for Christina‚Äô as she stood there thinking to herself, Should she say it! Should she say the words, For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! His he could make her feel that way one more time! Then death! Bring your ass on! 

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! She wanted more than just dreams of him! She wanted to feel him again! Even if it was to be

NeverMore!

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe?‚Äù

But Christina‚Äô being a dark haired girl! Having that gothic charm! Knew that she was going to get what she wanted! With her even knowing what happened five nights ago! Even though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone! But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled! By the one! Who could have her being 

NeverMore!

But for now! Shall we go back to five nights prior! Five nights ago when it all started! But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina‚Äô was looking forward to! But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied! 

As she lay there thinking to herself! Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her! After a good night of fucking for him! Just wasn‚Äôt enough for her! Guessing that‚Äôs why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could! 

Always finding them gone by morning! Gone before waking up! As she lay there looking up to the ceiling as she said! 

‚ÄúI swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!‚Äù

Always just to leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it‚Äôs like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It‚Äôs like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I‚Äôm just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass! They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn‚Äôt be God that answered her! But someone much darker! To match her gothic style, Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled. And occasional holding would be nice, But I guess that would be asking too much, For in a way Christina‚Äô would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn‚Äôt much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again! maybe another week or two! Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in!

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina‚Äô stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself! Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl! Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy! Needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I‚Äôm going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn‚Äôt so bad! It gives her the freedom to be free! 

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans! Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes! A pair a converses! And with that! To venture into whatever finds her! And find her something would! Something that she could have never imagined that would be! But imagined is beyond belief! This was beyond death itself!

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn‚Äôt get her feel either! Not even making it off of her floor. When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead! 

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy‚Äôs apartment. Jimmy‚Äô was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends! But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy‚Äô was into some serious, dark shit! Some Very dark shit! That often had Christina‚Äô questioning at times! As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened! But as usual the dicks just didn‚Äôt know what ass to look or go up! 

Only knowing the hookers around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn‚Äôt know dick! As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead! As Christina‚Äô then thought to herself 

‚ÄúWell no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!‚Äù

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy‚Äô sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn‚Äôt going to find out, who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch. But as Christina‚Äô then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy‚Äôs body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor.

But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall was the words written 

NeverMore! 

Just then as a Raven‚Äô flew into an open window landing on it‚Äôs bottom frame as it the crowed 

‚ÄúNeverMore!! NeverMore!

Like she said, Jimmy‚Äô was into some serious, dark shit! Walking on past making her way outside, where she would run into another guy. Someone that Christina‚Äô didn‚Äôt mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny‚Äô a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket! Sunny outside or not, With his eyes and hair to match! Someone that Christina‚Äô would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. 

But he already had someone, as Christina‚Äô then thought to her herself, at least Johnny‚Äô knew how to please someone. But as Christina‚Äô then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy‚Äô With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

‚ÄúLook! I don‚Äôt know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!‚Äù 

With Christina‚Äô then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

‚ÄúLook. I know! Well sorts knew Jimmy‚Äô much more she should have known about him! and he wasn‚Äôt into drugs Johnny‚Äô he was into some serious dark shit! But drugs! You don‚Äôt have to be so snarky you know‚Äù

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

‚ÄúLook! The other night me and Jimmy and a couple of other people, who I didn‚Äôt know who they were! went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn‚Äôt kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô then replying 

‚ÄúSomething else! What do you mean something else!‚Äù

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

As Christina‚Äô then looked back at him curious like then saying 

‚ÄúWhat! What do you mean? Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina‚Äô saying to her 

‚ÄúYeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!‚Äù

But as Christina‚Äô then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. Followed by the sounds of the Raven‚Äô

As Christina‚Äô stood there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. As a guy off in the distance was just a shredding away on his guitar! Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

NeverMore 

But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang‚Äô wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. 

Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang‚Äô then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

‚ÄúFor insane I have became! Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

With Chang‚Äô now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang‚Äô

‚ÄúSo a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be!‚Äù 

As Chang‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúWho are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?‚Äù

As the figure then said to Chang‚Äô 

‚ÄúIs it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then replied back saying to him

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!‚Äù

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang‚Äô saying to him

‚ÄúOh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúTell me what!‚Äù

As the figure then replied back to Chang‚Äô saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang‚Äô letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang‚Äô was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina‚Äô not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did! For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would suddenly came into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall behind them were the words 

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed! Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown with being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina‚Äô being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird! 

Just as a Raven‚Äô then flew by them saying to them

NeverMore

But to the scene Christina‚Äô made her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head for it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As Christina‚Äô stood there looking at the words, just as a Raven‚Äô Then Flew by her landing on a railing, crowning

‚ÄúNeverMore! NeverMore!‚Äù

Standing there now looking at the Raven‚Äô just as it then flew off into the day! Leaving the dead person to be, And Leaving her now with more questions than answers, As Christina‚Äô then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city‚Äôs landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders, But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come. So would two more murders, Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny‚Äô! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him.  

‚ÄúThe four other people that was with you and Jimmy‚Äô were they the ones murdered the last three nights‚Äù

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

‚ÄúLook! I was only along the ride! Those other five were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots‚Äù! 

With Christina‚Äô just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

‚Äú Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!‚Äù

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina‚Äô would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city‚Äôs night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style, More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Raven‚Äô then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

‚ÄúI have became insane! to a world that wants to know!‚Äù More than they should know!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut For those who chose not to know, never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed by knowing me‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to know? My love!

As Christina‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúDo I want to know what‚Äù?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40‚Äô with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina‚Äô more enticed than ever, Her eyes and heart were now set into place, with her now wanting more. More than she even dared herself to ask, But resist she could not! For there was just something mesmerizing about him that she wanted more off. A feeling of she needed him, a desire that she just could not hide anymore. Finding herself now wanting to know more of him that night. 

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don‚Äôt want to know?

With her again asking him

‚Äúknow what?‚Äù

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

‚ÄúTo know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know‚Äù

And desired to know more Christina‚Äô did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina‚Äô was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina‚Äôs body was now ready for his touch. A touch that she had been yearning for. To show her what she had been looking for, With him now looking at her as he then said 

‚ÄúTo know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if you need is to feel? Then my desire is to know you.‚Äù

The desire was here, Christina‚Äô thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

‚Äú I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina‚Äô was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina‚Äô heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina‚Äô could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be, But for one night, She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her. For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! As Her body was pulsating, To his very touch. A touch like no other to her. As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

‚ÄúTonight my love I will know you as you desire!‚Äù

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. As Christina‚Äô body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her, slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina‚Äôs cheek, As Christina‚Äô lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding me against her, going in and out her. Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her.

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants! Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

feeling his sweat as he then placed her hands around his back moving them up behind his head. 

Christina‚Äô could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci‚Äô saying

‚ÄúDam! I would give up hell just to be in her!‚Äù 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina‚Äô had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go! 

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina‚Äô asking her

‚ÄúDo you want to know?‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô now looking at him saying 

‚ÄúKnow what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô then asking 

‚ÄúWho!‚Äù

As he then just laughed as he said

‚ÄúI did!

‚ÄúI killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Raven behind her once again crowed

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù 

Just before it flew off into the night!

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina‚Äô even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning, But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore!

Leaving Christina Ricci‚Äô then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

A new tenant in the apartment across the courtyard. 4C. The one with the large window facing mine, framed by those slightly-too-short, gauzy curtains that never quite closed properly. You moved in on a Tuesday, hauling boxes that seemed too heavy for your frame. I remember how you looked on that Tuesday. Delicate bones beneath the effort, dark hair escaping the style you had been aiming for that hasteful morning, a few strands stuck to your temple with sweat. I was busy watering the small houseplant on my balcony. You glanced up, caught my eye, offered a quick, breathless smile. I smiled back.

That was all it took.

It wasn‚Äôt love at first sight. That‚Äôs just a lie people tell themselves to justify the inconvenient. No, it was curiosity. A spark that caught dry tinder in my soul I hadn‚Äôt even know was there. Who were you? Where did you come from? What made your eyes widen slightly when you looked at the city skyline from your balcony, like you were both thrilled and terrified? I had to know.

At first, it was casual. Glances while washing dishes. Noting your schedule. You left for work early, always rushing, coffee mug steaming in your hand. You came home late, shoulders slumped, sometimes carrying grocery bags that looked like they might split. You rarely drew your curtains fully at night. A slice of your life was perpetually on display: the warm glow of your lamp as you read on the faded blue couch, the flicker of your television as it painted shifting colours on the wall, the silhouette of you moving through the rooms ‚Äì brushing your hair, putting things away, standing still for moments at the window, looking out at the world beyond your little kingdom.

*Looking out.* But never, I noted with a strange mixture of disappointment and satisfaction, never really *seeing*.

I learned your routines. Mondays and Thursdays, yoga at 7 PM. You‚Äôd unroll a purple mat in the living room space visible from my vantage point. Sunday was laundry day. You hung things carefully on the small drying rack on your balcony. Practical cotton underwear, soft-looking t-shirts, one particular oversized grey sweater you seemed fond of. I was fond of it too. I noticed the brand of your detergent. Fresh linen. Clean.

I learned your loneliness. The way you‚Äôd sometimes sit on the sofa, phone in hand, staring at it for long minutes before putting it down without making a call. The way you always cooked single portions. The way you‚Äôd sometimes cry, shoulders shaking silently in the lamplight, face buried in your hands. I wanted to‚Ä¶ not comfort you, exactly. To acknowledge it, I think. To let you know someone saw the weight you carried. But distance was my ally. Distance was my shield.

I learned your small joys, too. The way you danced badly, wonderfully, when a particular song came on while you cooked. The way you‚Äôd curl up with a book and a mug of something steaming, completely absorbed. The way sunlight caught the gold flecks in your brown eyes when you stepped onto the balcony in the morning ‚Äì a detail visible only through my binoculars. Yes, binoculars. Birdwatching, I told myself. Urban birdwatching. And you were the most fascinating specimen of them all.

The more I watched, the more I knew you. Better than anyone else ever could. I knew you hated the shrill alarm on your phone; you‚Äôd smack it like it offended you personally. I knew you bit your lower lip when concentrating. I knew you favoured your left ankle slightly, an old injury perhaps. I knew the exact shade of pink that flushed your cheeks in the cold.

I knew you were vulnerable.

The courtyard between us became a sacred space, a theatre where your life unfolded just for me. The other apartments blurred into the background noise of the building. Only you mattered. Only your light in the darkness across from me. My own apartment felt like it receded, became merely a viewing platform, a nest. My life outside you ceased to hold meaning. Work became a tedious interruption between observations. Friends‚Äô voices became a drone I tuned out, impatient to get back to my window, to my vigil.

Do you understand? I wasn‚Äôt a monster. I wasn‚Äôt lurking in bushes or breathing down your neck. I was present. A constant, unseen guardian. I watched out for you. That man who lingered near the mailboxes a little too long a month ago? I noted his face, his build. I timed how long he stayed. Ready. Always ready. Because I knew your patterns. I knew when you were due home. If he‚Äôd made a move towards you as you rounded the corner, weighed down with shopping bags, I‚Äôd have tracked him down to the ends of the earth if I had to. I‚Äôd have taken a pair of pliers and pulled every tooth in his sick skull. I‚Äôd have cut out his tongue. I‚Äôd get a hammer and shatter every single finger on his hands. I‚Äôd have gotten my hands on a gun, and shot him in the kneecaps. No vital organs. Just pure pain. Then I‚Äôd have ripped out his fingernails and stabbed his eyes and then I‚Äôd have put a bullet in his brain.

He left before you arrived back home. But I was *watching*. Keeping you safe.

My presence was a gift. A silent devotion. I curated your privacy by observing it so minutely. I saw the *real* you, the unguarded moments no one else was privileged to witness. Didn‚Äôt that intimacy, however one-sided, create a bond? A deeper connection than the superficial chats you might have with someone in the elevator?

Of course, there were escalations. Necessary ones. To understand you fully. Your Wi-Fi password was easy to guess ‚Äì your cat‚Äôs name followed by your birth year, gleaned from a discarded envelope in the recycling dumpster I checked one collection day. All of a sudden, your digital life opened like a flower in bloom. Your Amazon orders. Your tentative messages to an old friend that always seemed to fizzle out. Your hesitant searches for therapists in the area. Your playlists, full of melancholic indie and folk that perfectly soundtracked my observations.

It wasn‚Äôt spying. It was‚Ä¶ context. Filling in the beautiful, intricate details of the painting I was gazing upon.

Then came the day you brought *him* home.

A Friday night. You were dressed differently. Brighter. Nervous energy crackled around you even from across the courtyard. He was tall, with loud laughter that carried faintly across the space, hands that lingered too familiarly on your arm as you unlocked your door. My blood turned to ice. Who was he? What right did he have?

I watched, rigid at my post, binoculars forgotten on the table beside me, my naked eyes straining through the dusk. I saw the bottle of wine opened. I saw you sitting close on the couch, his arm draped around you. I saw you lean in for a kiss.

I turned away. The betrayal was physical, a punch to the gut. How could you? After the silent communion we shared? This, this interloper. This *stranger*. He didn‚Äôt know you. Not like I did. He didn‚Äôt see the way your fingers trembled slightly when you were anxious. He didn‚Äôt know about the scar just below your left collarbone, visible when you wore that loose tank top. He hadn‚Äôt witnessed your silent tears or your terrible, wonderful dancing.

He stayed the night.

I didn‚Äôt sleep. I sat in the dark, the only light in the dim, mocking glow coming from your window. I listened to the muffled sounds of the city, straining to hear anything from your apartment. Silence. Then, finally, the soft click of your door closing as he left early the next morning. You stood in the doorway, wrapped in a robe, watching him go. You looked satisfied.

That was the day the distance became unbearable. Watching wasn‚Äôt enough. I needed proximity. I needed you to feel the weight of my observation, to understand the depth of my commitment.

It was surprisingly straightforward. Your building‚Äôs main door lock was faulty. A simple credit slipped in just right, and I was in. The stairwell smelled of dust and mould. Your door, 4C, felt warm under my fingertips. I didn‚Äôt go in. Not then. That would be crude. A violation. Instead, I pressed my ear against the wood. I heard the soft clatter of dishes from within. The murmur of your radio. The sound of your breath, just on the other side of the thin barrier. You never said anything, but that was fine. I would take your silence over anyone else‚Äôs voice.

Later, I found something better. A loose floorboard in the poorly lit hallway alcove near the fire escape. A perfect hiding spot. I could be closer. I could listen. I could wait.

I started leaving things. Small things. Innocuous. A single, perfect white pebble outside your door. A sprig of lavender tucked into the frame of your mailbox out in the courtyard. A postcard of a place I thought you‚Äôd like ‚Äì a quiet seaside town. It was left blank. No message needed. You‚Äôd understand it was from someone who *knew*. Someone who cared.

But you didn‚Äôt understand. I saw the confusion on your face when you found the pebble. The slight frown at the lavender. The way you glanced around the hallway after finding the postcard, a flicker of unease in your eyes before you shrugged it off. You were missing the point. The *intimacy*.

The frustration grew. The distance mocked me. I needed a gesture you couldn‚Äôt ignore. Something that spoke of my profound connection to your essence.

I waited for you to go to bed. I knew you‚Äôd be asleep fast. I chose your yoga night; I knew you were always so tired those nights. The faulty main door yielded again and I went up the stairs. Then I picked your lock.

Stepping into your apartment was like stepping into a sacred chapel. It smelled like you ‚Äì that clean linen detergent, faint perfume, the ghost of coffee. Your presence was thick in the air. I‚Äôd journeyed far and wide to this domain. Voyaged across stairwells that formed mountains and marshes of trash and knocked down doors and climbed in windows and listened, listened, listened, and now here I was in your apartment. There was a universe in that room, and in contrast it made me feel like a scrounger of toilets, a pillage of tombs. I moved silently, a shadow among your shadows. I saw the book you were reading on the arm of the couch. The half-empty mug on the coffee table. The grey sweater draped over a chair.

My heart hammered, a frantic percussion against my ribs. Not with fear, but with reverence. And possession.

I didn‚Äôt touch much. Just one thing. From the small, carved box on your dresser where I knew you kept your jewellery. A single strand of your dark hair, caught in a tangle. I slipped it into the tiny glass vial I‚Äôd brought in my back pocket, just in case.

A relic.

A tangible piece of you.

As I retreated, I saw it. Your hairbrush on the bathroom counter. Filled with strands of dark hair. I knew what I was supposed to do. My offering. My proof. I carefully removed all the hair from the brush, leaving it starkly clean. In its place, I left the glass vial containing the single strand. Centred perfectly on the cool porcelain.

*‚ÄúSee?‚Äù* I thought, melting back into the hallway, the faulty door clicking shut softly behind me. *‚ÄúSee how close I can get? See how well I know your space, your solitude?‚Äù*

I returned to my window across the courtyard. Minutes later, you woke up. I saw the lights come on and saw you groggily drift to the bathroom. Saw you stop dead in the doorway. Saw you pick up the vial. Saw the colour drain from your face as you stared at it. Saw you spin around, looking wildly around your apartment, then rushing to your window, peering out into the darkness, your eyes wide with dawning, terrified comprehension.

You looked right towards my building. Right towards my dark window.

You couldn‚Äôt see me, of course. I am very good at being unseen. But you *felt* it now, didn‚Äôt you? The weight. The constant, patient presence. The utter lack of distance that truly mattered.

A slow, overjoyed smile touched my lips. There it was. That connection, finally acknowledged. The fear was regrettable, but necessary. It was the first real emotion you‚Äôd ever truly directed towards me. Raw. Unfiltered. Beautiful in its own patchwork way.

You clutched the vial like a talisman against the evil eye, backing away from your window, quickly drawing those inadequate curtains tight. But it was too late. The veil was torn.

You‚Äôll call the police, probably. They‚Äôll come. They‚Äôll ask questions. They might even patrol for a night or two. But they won‚Äôt find anything. I am careful. I am the man who blends in. The quiet neighbour. The one who keeps to himself. They‚Äôll tell you to get better locks, maybe an alarm. They‚Äôll say it was probably just kids, just a prank. They‚Äôll leave.

And you‚Äôll sit in your apartment, heart pounding, jumping at every creak, constantly checking the locks, peering fearfully out through gaps in the curtains. You‚Äôll feel it. That prickle on the back of your neck. The certainty that somewhere in the darkness, unseen, unblinking eyes are fixed upon you.

You‚Äôll know, deep in your bones, that you are not alone. That you never really were.

Because I am here. Observing. Understanding. Existing. Closer than you can possibly imagine.

And so, I watch you from afar.",1,1752948037.0,Odd_directions,0,1.0,False

The murmur of your radio. The sound of your breath, just on the other side of the thin barrier. You never said anything, but that was fine. I would take your silence over anyone else‚Äôs voice.

Later, I found something better. A loose floorboard in the poorly lit hallway alcove near the fire escape. A perfect hiding spot. I could be closer. I could listen. I could wait.

I started leaving things. Small things. Innocuous. A single, perfect white pebble outside your door. A sprig of lavender tucked into the frame of your mailbox out in the courtyard. A postcard of a place I thought you‚Äôd like ‚Äì a quiet seaside town. It was left blank. No message needed. You‚Äôd understand it was from someone who *knew*. Someone who cared.

But you didn‚Äôt understand. I saw the confusion on your face when you found the pebble. The slight frown at the lavender. The way you glanced around the hallway after finding the postcard, a flicker of unease in your eyes before you shrugged it off. You were missing the point. The *intimacy*.

The frustration grew. The distance mocked me. I needed a gesture you couldn‚Äôt ignore. Something that spoke of my profound connection to your essence.

I waited for you to go to bed. I knew you‚Äôd be asleep fast. I chose your yoga night; I knew you were always so tired those nights. The faulty main door yielded again and I went up the stairs. Then I picked your lock.

Stepping into your apartment was like stepping into a sacred chapel. It smelled like you ‚Äì that clean linen detergent, faint perfume, the ghost of coffee. Your presence was thick in the air. I‚Äôd journeyed far and wide to this domain. Voyaged across stairwells that formed mountains and marshes of trash and knocked down doors and climbed in windows and listened, listened, listened, and now here I was in your apartment. There was a universe in that room, and in contrast it made me feel like a scrounger of toilets, a pillage of tombs. I moved silently, a shadow among your shadows. I saw the book you were reading on the arm of the couch. The half-empty mug on the coffee table. The grey sweater draped over a chair.

My heart hammered, a frantic percussion against my ribs. Not with fear, but with reverence. And possession.

I didn‚Äôt touch much. Just one thing. From the small, carved box on your dresser where I knew you kept your jewellery. A single strand of your dark hair, caught in a tangle. I slipped it into the tiny glass vial I‚Äôd brought in my back pocket, just in case.

A relic.

A tangible piece of you.

As I retreated, I saw it. Your hairbrush on the bathroom counter. Filled with strands of dark hair. I knew what I was supposed to do. My offering. My proof. I carefully removed all the hair from the brush, leaving it starkly clean. In its place, I left the glass vial containing the single strand. Centred perfectly on the cool porcelain.

*‚ÄúSee?‚Äù* I thought, melting back into the hallway, the faulty door clicking shut softly behind me. *‚ÄúSee how close I can get? See how well I know your space, your solitude?‚Äù*

I returned to my window across the courtyard. Minutes later, you woke up. I saw the lights come on and saw you groggily drift to the bathroom. Saw you stop dead in the doorway. Saw you pick up the vial. Saw the colour drain from your face as you stared at it. Saw you spin around, looking wildly around your apartment, then rushing to your window, peering out into the darkness, your eyes wide with dawning, terrified comprehension.

You looked right towards my building. Right towards my dark window.

You couldn‚Äôt see me, of course. I am very good at being unseen. But you *felt* it now, didn‚Äôt you? The weight. The constant, patient presence. The utter lack of distance that truly mattered.

A slow, overjoyed smile touched my lips. There it was. That connection, finally acknowledged. The fear was regrettable, but necessary. It was the first real emotion you‚Äôd ever truly directed towards me. Raw. Unfiltered. Beautiful in its own patchwork way.

You clutched the vial like a talisman against the evil eye, backing away from your window, quickly drawing those inadequate curtains tight. But it was too late. The veil was torn.

You‚Äôll call the police, probably. They‚Äôll come. They‚Äôll ask questions. They might even patrol for a night or two. But they won‚Äôt find anything. I am careful. I am the man who blends in. The quiet neighbour. The one who keeps to himself. They‚Äôll tell you to get better locks, maybe an alarm. They‚Äôll say it was probably just kids, just a prank. They‚Äôll leave.

And you‚Äôll sit in your apartment, heart pounding, jumping at every creak, constantly checking the locks, peering fearfully out through gaps in the curtains. You‚Äôll feel it. That prickle on the back of your neck. The certainty that somewhere in the darkness, unseen, unblinking eyes are fixed upon you.

You‚Äôll know, deep in your bones, that you are not alone. That you never really were.

Because I am here. Observing. Understanding. Existing. Closer than you can possibly imagine.

And so, I watch you from afar.",1,1752948010.0,deepnightsociety,0,1.0,False

**About Me**

I grew up poor to a mechanic dad and a trucker mom, so I never had a ton of exposure to white collar work or what job opportunities there were. Rather than taking on debt, picking something blind, and risking it not panning out, I decided to get work experience and maybe go back to school once I had a plan of what I wanted to do. Now that I've gotten this far, it's become an ego thing to keep going without one just to see when I'll finally hit a wall where my lack of degree truly stops me. When I'm between jobs, I've never been out of work longer than 3 months at a time.

My career path was customer support > advanced support > writing the guides support uses > managing the content projects for a line of business > managing the team that writes the content > managing the software that manages content for a sales team > implementing new software that manages content for a sales team and defining the full content strategy.

**How to be a good employee - in a way that benefits you**

Corporate work is a team sport in most cases, not an individual one. It doesn't matter if you're the smartest person in the room if nobody wants to work with you because you're a pain in the ass. Learn to say your piece, build your argument, and move on - the work you're doing reflects more on the owning manager than yourself, so don't bog yourself down taking everything personally or trying to be the star. It's more important the work gets done on time and in budget than it is to deliver something perfect.

Rarely give an opinion without asking why things are the way they are today. I used to be super guilty of this when I felt like there was an obvious solution, but I wasn't thinking big picture. Sometimes a dumb process exists because someone dumb made it, yes, but most of the time, the issue is that fixing the issue is going to cause new problems for other teams, or there are data limitations in what can be shared with a third party software, or there's some sort of legacy problem that popped up that resulted in the current outcome. Always ask before deciding you know everything and can fix everything.

When you're making business proposals for stuff you want to do, have the big picture in mind. Most teams go through planning processes towards the beginning of the year where they determine this years goals - know them, and when you make business proposals for improvement, connect what you want to do to those key goals. You'll have an easier time getting those accepted when you're making suggestions around your first couple entry level roles.

If I'm going to complain about something, it's coming with a short-term, bandaid fix, and a medium-term good enough solution, and a long-term perfect world solution, unless it's completely out of my wheelhouse to solve. If you're regularly making more work for your manager or complaining without solving anything, you're going to struggle to get ahead. Not to mention, you're losing valuable opportunities to demonstrate skills you otherwise don't have the opportunity to get experience on.

Your social skills only become more important the higher up you go, unless you're in an IC role. You need to be able to convince people to do things for you to progress your projects, you need to learn how to get people on your side to argue against dumbass decisions, and you need people to listen when you have something you need to say. I've gotten promotions in some cases over people who were more technically sound than I was, solely because I had already demonstrated my ability to work with and convince the stakeholders who work with our team to do what we need them to do.

**Appearance**

It matters, but not in the way you think. How you present yourself creates assumptions around your professionalism, capabilities, and attention to detail. That doesn't mean you need to run out and buy a suit or wear designer clothes, but having frizz-free hair done in a style that suits you, taking notes on the formality level of what people at the level you're trying to go to wear, and making sure your clothes fit and are unwrinkled, does a lot for your first impression.

For dudes, don't go to the discount barber to get your first styled haircut, go to one that cares about your end product and making sure you look your best. Have seen those [barber transformation videos?](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3lOnwsjcwF8) A lot of folks are walking around with the number 2, leave it long on the top not realizing what they could actually look like with a little more thought.

Unless you're lucky with a chronically honest manager like I was, people aren't going to tell you that you look disheveled because that's rude, they're just going to let you get passed up on. I wasn't raised to care about appearances, it was your heart and capabilities that count, so this was a huge wakeup call for me after my first promotion passover (I wore jeans, tshirts, and dirty sneakers like everyone else at my level at my job), but I got the next thanks to those small changes.

**Upskilling**

I'm constantly upskilling as soon as I'm comfortable in my job - I look up at the positions I want and use coffee chats with folks about what makes them successful in those roles and posted job descriptions as a task list of skills I need to work on and demonstrate so I'm prepared for the time when the position is open.

If I can't receive an opportunity to utilize a skill in my normal work, I make them for myself by building business cases around stuff I want to do that will materially help our team and present it to my managers. Not every suggestion will be taken, but with practice and refining your skills, eventually an opportunity will pop up where the time or money savings are too good to pass up.

I also say yes to out-of-scope work for the same reason, and regularly ask what I can deprioritize on my normal tasks so I maintain my work-life balance to take it on. They're going to hire someone with those skills regardless, you're only shooting yourself in the foot experience-wise at this job and your next if you don't grab those opportunities yourself.

I self-advocate. My managers either know exactly where I want to go or if they're touchy about keeping people on their team, what skills I want more work on so that I can build my resume experience.

I also track all of my big successes and achievements across my career in a google doc and in my 1:1 before promotion time, because human memories are short and prone to recency bias, I remind my manager about all the great work I've done for that time period. I learned to keep my mouth shut as well - if you say you don't want to do more than what you currently do/you don't want to manage people, folks will automatically take you out of the running when opportunities come up.

Dear god, take feedback, there's a lesson to be learned in everything you receive whether it's valid or someone's a sensitive little bitch. If you work with a difficult person, look at what the folks they successfully work with do to connect with them or how they get them to do things. If someone's telling you you're longwinded, take that as a note to be more direct in your approach when you message that person. Don't be egotistical and insist it's your way or the highway, sometimes you have to adapt to the situation to get through it. Even the most toxic places I've ever worked have had lessons I took away and still use to this day, like following up verbally received instruction with written confirmation of assigned tasks.

Ask questions to other teams you work with, and pick up some of their skills through youtube and other courses, it gives you a common language to better phrase and reframe your asks of them. Even though managing content systems is largely project management/process related, knowing basics around UX helps me communicate with our visual designers, having basic SQL and excel skills means I can analyze my own data and brainstorm with our tech team on how to deliver something I want to build, etc. Don't feel like you're limited in scope just to your job, knowing how other teams impact you and being able to speak to it makes everything easier.

**Networking**

Traditional cold networking events only work for rich people and small industries, for the rest of us, it's way more important that you have a good working relationship with your coworkers. Your old coworkers who know you're a hard worker, are easy to work with, and don't cause problems are going to be your best advocates and resource for referrals over Joe you met twice at a networking event.

Developing coworker relationships is easy - I shout out members of my team who helped me on projects, which leads to an environment when they shout me out for helping them, increasing my advocates come promotion time. I teach people how to do things, I build or share resources that help them, etc - I don't view my coworkers as my competition, they're my network, and when they talk me up to their managers, their managers don't argue with my manager when I'm up for promotion.

**Applying to jobs**

Applying to jobs is basically a sales pitch for 'why you' - you need to paint the story of what it'll be like working with you through your resume and interview answers. If you're not getting interviews, your resume is the problem, if you're not making it past the interview stage, you're either overshooting or undershooting on roles that you're interested in, or your interview skills are weak.

ALSO learn your transferrable skills, don't limit yourself just to whatever your degree or past career has been. I work with folks with archaeology, history, comms, and communications degrees. If you wanted a degree to do my job, you'd get a master's in information architecture, yet I've met exactly one person who specialized in school. The rest of us just learned on the job. Teachers, as another example, are always surprised to find out they're highly prized in learning and development, project management, and supportive sales roles like customer success.

*Resumes*

Yes, having keywords is important, but don't pack your resume with keywords to the point that you lose the sauce about matching your skills to what they're actually looking for. I do hiring now, and there are so many people just plagiarizing the job description and not properly selling that they actually have experience doing what we're looking for help with and not just running their resume through AI to try and be the perfect match.

Be careful about using AI to do this when you don't know how to write a good resume, because you're not going to catch the errors if you don't bother to learn - I've had folks download their AI resume, assume it's good to go because a computer did it for them, only for the final product to look like a middle school project. You also have to keep in mind that you're not unique using AI - if you and 10 other people with your same experience and skill level make an AI resume, it's going to read the same across all of your resumes and it's going to be harder to stand out to get picked for the interview.

You'll list all your jobs in the past 10 years in your background check, your resume should be the top relevant highlights of experience for the position you're going for. Your job at tacobell in the 10th grade is irrelevant to being a project manager, leave it off.

Lead your bullet points with success. Rather than framing it like 'Launched program and developed team doing xyz reducing metrics by', try 'reduced metrics by XYZ by launching program and developing team'. You increase your chances of the line actually being read in full by creating curiosity.

*Interviews*

Develop your elevator pitch to answer 'tell me about yourself' and practice it so your delivery is smooth. It's basically a cover letter but delivered verbally that gives you a chance to tell your story and address gaps in your career or experience. I typically deliver why I don't have a degree here so we can get it out of the way, as people are always curious.

Pre-select experience you have that matches the skills they're looking for in the job description, and practice responding to interview questions with those stories in mind. I recommend the STAR method (framing the story in situation, task, action, and result)

Make sure that 'I don't know' is never a complete answer. You can explain what you would do in that situation, or what steps you'd take to figure out how to solve the problem even if you don't have an answer right in front of you. I can train you on a new process or tool, I can't train you to think for yourself or to recognize where your social skills need to kick in.

There are 4 key skills you need to focus on presenting in your interview, whether they're listed in the job description or not - being a team player, knowing when to ask for help, being adaptable, and owning solutions. If you have all four of those, your chances of the closing the interview are incredibly high, as long as you have the experience/skills they need to back it up.

**Mentorship**

Don't listen to just anyone about how to grow your career, look for people who came from a similar starting point as you, they'll understand how much detail or background info you'll need to progress in the same way. Folks who just walked into a manager job straight out of college don't get the level of scrappiness you need to climb through the early parts of your career because it was handed to them right out of college, and once you're in your first managerial role out of entry level, you get a lot more guidance from your managers on how to progress compared to the overworked ones managing entry level.

If you're truly stuck on how to get started, look up job training programs like Pursuit or YearUp, apprenticeships run by companies like Accenture or Deloitte for no-degree adults or other local non-profits focused on skilling up driven low-income students. They're really annoying to find, they don't seem to believe in SEO on their websites, but I volunteer for these types of programs as a career coach and my matched mentees have gone on to get positions they never dreamed of being capable of landing.

**Conclusion**

I don't believe in pulling the ladder up behind me, so I hope you can take away at least something from my pointers. I'm sure there are others I'm not thinking of right now, so please ask and maybe it'll jog my memory to continue to add to the list.",7,1752947971.0,careeradvice,1,0.89,False

1m42m82,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m42m82/and_so_i_watch_you_from_afar/,And so I watch you from afar,"It started, as these things often do, with a simple noticing. A new tenant in the apartment across the courtyard. 4C. The one with the large window facing mine, framed by those slightly-too-short, gauzy curtains that never quite closed properly. You moved in on a Tuesday, hauling boxes that seemed too heavy for your frame. I remember how you looked on that Tuesday. Delicate bones beneath the effort, dark hair escaping the style you had been aiming for that hasteful morning, a few strands stuck to your temple with sweat. I was busy watering the small houseplant on my balcony. You glanced up, caught my eye, offered a quick, breathless smile. I smiled back.

That was all it took.

It wasn‚Äôt love at first sight. That‚Äôs just a lie people tell themselves to justify the inconvenient. No, it was curiosity. A spark that caught dry tinder in my soul I hadn‚Äôt even know was there. Who were you? Where did you come from? What made your eyes widen slightly when you looked at the city skyline from your balcony, like you were both thrilled and terrified? I had to know.

At first, it was casual. Glances while washing dishes. Noting your schedule. You left for work early, always rushing, coffee mug steaming in your hand. You came home late, shoulders slumped, sometimes carrying grocery bags that looked like they might split. You rarely drew your curtains fully at night. A slice of your life was perpetually on display: the warm glow of your lamp as you read on the faded blue couch, the flicker of your television as it painted shifting colours on the wall, the silhouette of you moving through the rooms ‚Äì brushing your hair, putting things away, standing still for moments at the window, looking out at the world beyond your little kingdom.

*Looking out.* But never, I noted with a strange mixture of disappointment and satisfaction, never really *seeing*.

I learned your routines. Mondays and Thursdays, yoga at 7 PM. You‚Äôd unroll a purple mat in the living room space visible from my vantage point. Sunday was laundry day. You hung things carefully on the small drying rack on your balcony. Practical cotton underwear, soft-looking t-shirts, one particular oversized grey sweater you seemed fond of. I was fond of it too. I noticed the brand of your detergent. Fresh linen. Clean.

I learned your loneliness. The way you‚Äôd sometimes sit on the sofa, phone in hand, staring at it for long minutes before putting it down without making a call. The way you always cooked single portions. The way you‚Äôd sometimes cry, shoulders shaking silently in the lamplight, face buried in your hands. I wanted to‚Ä¶ not comfort you, exactly. To acknowledge it, I think. To let you know someone saw the weight you carried. But distance was my ally. Distance was my shield.

I learned your small joys, too. The way you danced badly, wonderfully, when a particular song came on while you cooked. The way you‚Äôd curl up with a book and a mug of something steaming, completely absorbed. The way sunlight caught the gold flecks in your brown eyes when you stepped onto the balcony in the morning ‚Äì a detail visible only through my binoculars. Yes, binoculars. Birdwatching, I told myself. Urban birdwatching. And you were the most fascinating specimen of them all.

The more I watched, the more I knew you. Better than anyone else ever could. I knew you hated the shrill alarm on your phone; you‚Äôd smack it like it offended you personally. I knew you bit your lower lip when concentrating. I knew you favoured your left ankle slightly, an old injury perhaps. I knew the exact shade of pink that flushed your cheeks in the cold.

I knew you were vulnerable.

The courtyard between us became a sacred space, a theatre where your life unfolded just for me. The other apartments blurred into the background noise of the building. Only you mattered. Only your light in the darkness across from me. My own apartment felt like it receded, became merely a viewing platform, a nest. My life outside you ceased to hold meaning. Work became a tedious interruption between observations. Friends‚Äô voices became a drone I tuned out, impatient to get back to my window, to my vigil.

Do you understand? I wasn‚Äôt a monster. I wasn‚Äôt lurking in bushes or breathing down your neck. I was present. A constant, unseen guardian. I watched out for you. That man who lingered near the mailboxes a little too long a month ago? I noted his face, his build. I timed how long he stayed. Ready. Always ready. Because I knew your patterns. I knew when you were due home. If he‚Äôd made a move towards you as you rounded the corner, weighed down with shopping bags, I‚Äôd have tracked him down to the ends of the earth if I had to. I‚Äôd have taken a pair of pliers and pulled every tooth in his sick skull. I‚Äôd have cut out his tongue. I‚Äôd get a hammer and shatter every single finger on his hands. I‚Äôd have gotten my hands on a gun, and shot him in the kneecaps. No vital organs. Just pure pain. Then I‚Äôd have ripped out his fingernails and stabbed his eyes and then I‚Äôd have put a bullet in his brain.

He left before you arrived back home. But I was *watching*. Keeping you safe.

My presence was a gift. A silent devotion. I curated your privacy by observing it so minutely. I saw the *real* you, the unguarded moments no one else was privileged to witness. Didn‚Äôt that intimacy, however one-sided, create a bond? A deeper connection than the superficial chats you might have with someone in the elevator?

Of course, there were escalations. Necessary ones. To understand you fully. Your Wi-Fi password was easy to guess ‚Äì your cat‚Äôs name followed by your birth year, gleaned from a discarded envelope in the recycling dumpster I checked one collection day. All of a sudden, your digital life opened like a flower in bloom. Your Amazon orders. Your tentative messages to an old friend that always seemed to fizzle out. Your hesitant searches for therapists in the area. Your playlists, full of melancholic indie and folk that perfectly soundtracked my observations.

It wasn‚Äôt spying. It was‚Ä¶ context. Filling in the beautiful, intricate details of the painting I was gazing upon.

Then came the day you brought *him* home.

A Friday night. You were dressed differently. Brighter. Nervous energy crackled around you even from across the courtyard. He was tall, with loud laughter that carried faintly across the space, hands that lingered too familiarly on your arm as you unlocked your door. My blood turned to ice. Who was he? What right did he have?

I watched, rigid at my post, binoculars forgotten on the table beside me, my naked eyes straining through the dusk. I saw the bottle of wine opened. I saw you sitting close on the couch, his arm draped around you. I saw you lean in for a kiss.

I turned away. The betrayal was physical, a punch to the gut. How could you? After the silent communion we shared? This, this interloper. This *stranger*. He didn‚Äôt know you. Not like I did. He didn‚Äôt see the way your fingers trembled slightly when you were anxious. He didn‚Äôt know about the scar just below your left collarbone, visible when you wore that loose tank top. He hadn‚Äôt witnessed your silent tears or your terrible, wonderful dancing.

He stayed the night.

I didn‚Äôt sleep. I sat in the dark, the only light in the dim, mocking glow coming from your window. I listened to the muffled sounds of the city, straining to hear anything from your apartment. Silence. Then, finally, the soft click of your door closing as he left early the next morning. You stood in the doorway, wrapped in a robe, watching him go. You looked satisfied.

That was the day the distance became unbearable. Watching wasn‚Äôt enough. I needed proximity. I needed you to feel the weight of my observation, to understand the depth of my commitment.

It was surprisingly straightforward. Your building‚Äôs main door lock was faulty. A simple credit slipped in just right, and I was in. The stairwell smelled of dust and mould. Your door, 4C, felt warm under my fingertips. I didn‚Äôt go in. Not then. That would be crude. A violation. Instead, I pressed my ear against the wood. I heard the soft clatter of dishes from within. The murmur of your radio. The sound of your breath, just on the other side of the thin barrier. You never said anything, but that was fine. I would take your silence over anyone else‚Äôs voice.

Later, I found something better. A loose floorboard in the poorly lit hallway alcove near the fire escape. A perfect hiding spot. I could be closer. I could listen. I could wait.

I started leaving things. Small things. Innocuous. A single, perfect white pebble outside your door. A sprig of lavender tucked into the frame of your mailbox out in the courtyard. A postcard of a place I thought you‚Äôd like ‚Äì a quiet seaside town. It was left blank. No message needed. You‚Äôd understand it was from someone who *knew*. Someone who cared.

But you didn‚Äôt understand. I saw the confusion on your face when you found the pebble. The slight frown at the lavender. The way you glanced around the hallway after finding the postcard, a flicker of unease in your eyes before you shrugged it off. You were missing the point. The *intimacy*.

The frustration grew. The distance mocked me. I needed a gesture you couldn‚Äôt ignore. Something that spoke of my profound connection to your essence.

I waited for you to go to bed. I knew you‚Äôd be asleep fast. I chose your yoga night; I knew you were always so tired those nights. The faulty main door yielded again and I went up the stairs. Then I picked your lock.

Stepping into your apartment was like stepping into a sacred chapel. It smelled like you ‚Äì that clean linen detergent, faint perfume, the ghost of coffee. Your presence was thick in the air. I‚Äôd journeyed far and wide to this domain. Voyaged across stairwells that formed mountains and marshes of trash and knocked down doors and climbed in windows and listened, listened, listened, and now here I was in your apartment. There was a universe in that room, and in contrast it made me feel like a scrounger of toilets, a pillage of tombs. I moved silently, a shadow among your shadows. I saw the book you were reading on the arm of the couch. The half-empty mug on the coffee table. The grey sweater draped over a chair.

My heart hammered, a frantic percussion against my ribs. Not with fear, but with reverence. And possession.

I didn‚Äôt touch much. Just one thing. From the small, carved box on your dresser where I knew you kept your jewellery. A single strand of your dark hair, caught in a tangle. I slipped it into the tiny glass vial I‚Äôd brought in my back pocket, just in case.

A relic.

A tangible piece of you.

As I retreated, I saw it. Your hairbrush on the bathroom counter. Filled with strands of dark hair. I knew what I was supposed to do. My offering. My proof. I carefully removed all the hair from the brush, leaving it starkly clean. In its place, I left the glass vial containing the single strand. Centred perfectly on the cool porcelain.

*‚ÄúSee?‚Äù* I thought, melting back into the hallway, the faulty door clicking shut softly behind me. *‚ÄúSee how close I can get? See how well I know your space, your solitude?‚Äù*

I returned to my window across the courtyard. Minutes later, you woke up. I saw the lights come on and saw you groggily drift to the bathroom. Saw you stop dead in the doorway. Saw you pick up the vial. Saw the colour drain from your face as you stared at it. Saw you spin around, looking wildly around your apartment, then rushing to your window, peering out into the darkness, your eyes wide with dawning, terrified comprehension.

You looked right towards my building. Right towards my dark window.

You couldn‚Äôt see me, of course. I am very good at being unseen. But you *felt* it now, didn‚Äôt you? The weight. The constant, patient presence. The utter lack of distance that truly mattered.

A slow, overjoyed smile touched my lips. There it was. That connection, finally acknowledged. The fear was regrettable, but necessary. It was the first real emotion you‚Äôd ever truly directed towards me. Raw. Unfiltered. Beautiful in its own patchwork way.

You clutched the vial like a talisman against the evil eye, backing away from your window, quickly drawing those inadequate curtains tight. But it was too late. The veil was torn.

You‚Äôll call the police, probably. They‚Äôll come. They‚Äôll ask questions. They might even patrol for a night or two. But they won‚Äôt find anything. I am careful. I am the man who blends in. The quiet neighbour. The one who keeps to himself. They‚Äôll tell you to get better locks, maybe an alarm. They‚Äôll say it was probably just kids, just a prank. They‚Äôll leave.

And you‚Äôll sit in your apartment, heart pounding, jumping at every creak, constantly checking the locks, peering fearfully out through gaps in the curtains. You‚Äôll feel it. That prickle on the back of your neck. The certainty that somewhere in the darkness, unseen, unblinking eyes are fixed upon you.

You‚Äôll know, deep in your bones, that you are not alone. That you never really were.

Because I am here. Observing. Understanding. Existing. Closer than you can possibly imagine.

And so, I watch you from afar.",3,1752947919.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1m42lus,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1m42lus/the_quiet_tenant_a_horror_story/,The Quiet Tenant (A Horror Story),"Part I: The Hall That Listens

The dog was back again.

Paul heard it most nights now, pacing outside the building just past midnight. At first, he thought it might just be a stray, mangy and lost, maybe left behind by some tenant who moved away in a hurry. But this dog never begged. Never barked. Never left messes or paw prints. It simply walked in circles around the building entrance, slow and deliberate, as if it belonged to someone who still lived there.

Its growl wasn‚Äôt natural. It was low, mechanical‚Äîlike something broken and breathing through rust.

The first time Paul heard it, he didn‚Äôt sleep.

The second time, he thought about recording it, but when he pressed his phone to the window, the sound vanished.

Mrs. Kim from 4C caught him in the stairwell one afternoon. She was usually chatty, a kind of informal bulletin board for building gossip, but that day her voice trembled. She said she‚Äôd seen the dog from her balcony‚Äîjust for a second, in the lightning.

""It had the wrong eyes,"" she whispered. ""Like paper after it's burned.""

Paul chuckled nervously, but she didn't smile.

Ever since Lara moved out, the apartment had felt too quiet. They‚Äôd broken up over things that seemed small at the time‚Äîwho bought groceries, whose turn it was to clean. She said the place gave her a weird feeling. Said the hallway lights flickered too much. Said the air never moved right.

He thought she was being dramatic.

Now he wasn‚Äôt so sure.

Lately, the elevator made sounds like breathing when it rose past his floor. The stairwell light by 3B flickered every time he stepped beneath it, and the doorknob to the laundry room felt... warm. Always. Even in winter.

He‚Äôd never seen the tenant in 3A.

Nobody had.

The super said the guy paid six months at a time, in crisp cash. No requests. No complaints. No calls. Just silence behind the door.

Sometimes, late at night, Paul thought he heard movement‚Äîsoft thudding, like someone walking barefoot across carpet. But there was no carpet in 3A. The building used old hardwood floors, scuffed and uneven.

And sometimes... scratching.

Not rats. Not pipes. Not the wind. This was deliberate. Long strokes. Like someone dragging fingernails across the inside of the walls, trying to trace words into the plaster. Trying to say something.

One night, Paul found a note under his door.

Do not speak his name. Do not knock. If he knocks, do not answer.

It was printed in black ink on stiff white paper. No signature. No smudges. The paper smelled faintly of bleach.

That night, the dog did not growl.

It whimpered.

Part II: The Night Door

The next day brought relentless rain. It fell hard and steady, drumming on the fire escape like impatient fingers. The city outside blurred to a smear of wet brick and traffic lights.

Paul stayed in.

He unplugged the phone, turned the deadbolt twice, and made a cup of coffee he didn‚Äôt drink.

At exactly 12:03 a.m., he heard the first knock.

Not at the front door.

At the wall.

Three knocks.

Measured. Deep.

He stood in the middle of the living room, still as a photograph. The glass on the table trembled. The walls held their breath.

Then it came again‚Äîcloser.

Not muffled anymore. Louder, sharper. As if the knock had moved inside the apartment.

Paul stepped back toward the hallway, heart punching against his ribs.

Behind him, something knocked again.

This time, from inside the coat closet.

He turned. The door was closed. Silent.

He approached it like it might explode. Slowly, inch by inch, he opened it.

There was no coat. No umbrella.

Just a hole.

A perfect black circle, carved cleanly into the back wall. Smooth edges, impossibly precise. No sign of dust. It hadn't been there before.

He leaned forward, squinting.

Something moved inside.

A hand.

Long fingers, pale and wrong, with too many knuckles, held out a folded piece of paper. It didn‚Äôt reach forward like a human offering something. It presented it, like a butler unveiling a cursed relic.

Paul couldn‚Äôt move.

The paper dropped from its fingers and fluttered to the floor.

The hand withdrew.

He slammed the closet shut and shoved a chair against it, heart hammering in his throat.

All night, something scratched softly against the inside of the door.

Part III: Something Beneath Us

On Friday, Paul cracked.

He tried to call the super. The line rang until it stopped with a flat mechanical tone.

He walked downstairs. The office door was open, the lights off. Inside, everything was coated in dust and mildew. The calendar on the wall was still turned to April. It was August.

He knocked on Mrs. Kim‚Äôs door. Nothing.

Tried 2B. 4A. Even the guy with the guitar in 5D. No one answered. No footsteps. No sound.

The building was too quiet.

But 3A‚Äôs door was open.

Just a crack.

Paul stared at it for a long time. He should have walked away. But he couldn‚Äôt. Something pulled at him, a pressure behind the eyes, a scent on the air like rust and jasmine.

He pushed it open.

Inside, the air was cold. Wet-cave cold.

The apartment was bare, windowless, and painted the color of old teeth.

In the center of the room stood a door.

It wasn‚Äôt attached to any wall. It just stood upright, tall and narrow, with no hinges and no knob.

It was made of black wood veined with something red, like muscle beneath bark. Strange carvings spiraled over its surface‚Äîglyphs that shimmered and twisted when he tried to read them.

Behind him, the apartment door shut.

The strange door in the center of the room knocked.

Three times.

Then it whispered.

The voice was not loud, but it filled the room. It came from inside his skull. Inside his lungs.

""You let me in,"" it said.

Paul backed away.

""You left the space open. You broke the silence. Now I will fill it.""

The door creaked inward.

Behind it was no room.

There was a hallway of flesh, lined with mirrors that reflected things that never happened. On the ceiling, something pulsed. The air stank of birth and grave soil.

Paul screamed.

But no sound came out.

The floor pulled him in‚Äînot like gravity, but like hunger.

He fell forward.

He fell through.

Down past rooms filled with whispering mouths. Down past stairwells made of bone.

He saw apartments stacked like coffins. In each, a tenant sat perfectly still, eyes wide, lips moving silently.

And he saw himself, multiplied in shadow. One version holding the closet door open. Another staring through the keyhole. A third already inside the black door, but with no eyes left to scream.

He landed in darkness.

And something began to climb into him.

It used his name.

It peeled the silence off his bones and wore it like a robe.

When the new tenant stepped into 3B the next day, he looked like Paul.

But he did not blink.

And he never spoke.

At night, he sat by the window and listened to the dog circle the building.

It no longer growled.

It waited.

‚ÄúI looked it up, he was attached to Ragnar squad that day.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean I was there, there was no mention of him!‚Äù

‚Äú He would have been in the support group only need to know.‚Äù

Now that he said it, the engineers that day were unusually numerous and armed. Sean noticed my change in demeanor and ¬†shifted, crouching near the fire.

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs what made that titan so dangerous,‚Äù he looked around at us ‚ÄúThink about it. He shows up at what was supposed to be a small dispute and you happen to come across the first titans seen in 100 years and abnormal as well.‚Äù

He turned his gaze to me ‚Äú I remember you saying, captain, even for an abnormal, it was unbelievably vicious, like the entirety of Ragnar squad gone in a matter of seconds! You think it‚Äôs normal, just bad luck? The more you look, the more off it feels.‚Äù

My brow tightened, but I didn‚Äôt interrupt.

Sean went on, voice low but hard. ‚ÄúAt the demon site, he was there too. Nothing we did provoked it, but it went off like we‚Äôd burned its nest. Now this giant. Same deal. It saw us. Ignored us. Walked straight into the village and wiped it off the map.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought giants were peaceful,‚Äù Asha murmured, more to herself than anyone.

Sean nodded like that was exactly his point. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre slow. Cautious. Closer to elephants than monsters. But this one? It sprinted through concrete like it owed someone money.‚Äù

That earned a tired huff from Petra, but no one smiled.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been attached to multiple squads before us,‚Äù Sean continued. ‚ÄúAll of them suffered heavy casualties. Quiet reshuffles, sudden promotions ‚Äî like Rex‚Äôs whole team getting bumped up. Like they had to plug holes.‚Äù

Petra looked at me. I said nothing.

Sean let out a breath. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have proof. It‚Äôs all just... smoke. But there‚Äôs fire under it. I know it.‚Äù

There was a moment of quiet. Asha leaned forward, arms on her knees, the firelight dancing across her cheek.

‚ÄúWe should be careful,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf he finds out we‚Äôre digging into this‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe keep it between us. For now, we don‚Äôt know how dangerous this really is. Could be targeted, could be collateral. Either way, we play smart.‚Äù

Sean didn‚Äôt look convinced.

‚ÄúI need your word, Sean.‚Äù

He hesitated. Then nodded. ‚ÄúYou have it.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt convinced‚Ä¶

Marcus, who‚Äôd been perched a few meters away keeping an eye on the path, called over. ‚ÄúBoss. He‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

Just like that, we shut up. I stood, dusting the back of my trousers. The dust of their tires caught the rising sun as a bright red hue in the air almost warning us of their presence. The car stopped about 10m from us as the front left window was rolled down.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre heading out,‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúPack up. The captain‚Äôs expected back at the airstrip.‚Äù The south africans had completely dropped the charade now, barking out orders as extensions of the tourist himself.

I didn‚Äôt have enough energy for any wit, I just nodded without complaint.

We moved in silence, gathering bags and breaking down what little camp we had. It had been more than a day since any of us slept, it was starting to show.

As Petra handed me the last of the gear, she hesitated.

‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶ See anything at the fire yesterday?‚Äù she asked.

I paused. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

She nodded slowly. Pretty sure didn‚Äôt believe me. I‚Äôm a shit liar, much to everyone‚Äôs surprise‚Ä¶

The drive back was long, but no one spoke. Everyone was still coming down from the adrenaline and the grief. Izea and Georgie had barely warmed their boots before they were gone.

As we loaded into the creaking, patchwork excuse of a plane, I caught sight of where they had curled up together the night before. No one sat there.

I don‚Äôt remember falling asleep‚Äîonly the violent jolt of the wheels hitting gravel that waking me up.

I blinked, head heavy, and glanced across the aisle.

Petra was already awake, sitting rigid, arms folded, eyes locked on the corner of the cabin.

Not looking out the window. Not at me. Just‚Ä¶ staring like she‚Äôd seen something familiar.

I followed her gaze to where Izea and Georgie used to sit.

We‚Äôd landed somewhere else. Cooler. Greener. Trees surrounded the strip, and the air smelled like damp pine and fuel. The sun was somehow still rising; we must have flown west.

The runway was barely more than a flattened gravel road. A makeshift camp sat tucked between the trees ‚Äî canvas tents, tired-looking supply crates, a large khaki structure farther off with a few cables running into it.

The Tourist was waiting. His smile looked almost genuine‚Ä¶ made me nauseous.

‚ÄúYou did well, Captain,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you.‚Äù

I nearly threw up.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll remain here for a few days. Rest up. There‚Äôll be another squad joining you soon.‚Äù He gestured lazily toward the tents near the woods ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your area.‚Äù

Then his expression flattened.

‚ÄúI have an important meeting later. Do not disturb me.‚Äù

With that, he turned and walked toward the structure. With the two -I don‚Äôt know, im starting to run out of nicknames for them - he two south African dipshits following like the good little puppy dogs they are. Twats‚Ä¶.

We shuffled off, bags in hand. Every step felt heavier than it should‚Äôve.

We trudged toward the camp. The ground squelched underfoot. Petra kept everyone moving while I observed the amazing facilities we had been given.

AS we approached the tents, I could see something lurking, not 5 m into the thicket. Id been wondering if he was going to show up at some point.

Just nestled in the tree line, maybe twenty feet from me, stood Luke from Hunter Squad. Just like I didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt blink. Just stared. Giving me the silent treatment‚Ä¶

‚ÄúGood of you to pop by,‚Äù I muttered sarcastically.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù Petra asked. ‚ÄúDid you say something?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat, ehm, no, probably I‚Äôm just tired.‚Äù

I knew she wouldn‚Äôt believe me, she‚Äôs too sharp for that, but honestly that‚Äôs fine with me as long as I don‚Äôt have to confront whatever this is.

As I hoped, she didn‚Äôt press. Just gave me a look and turned back to the others.

‚ÄúGet them sorted, would you?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

I was going to have a nap, but found myself helping unload supplies, tossing up tents, and getting a fire going. My hands needed something to do. I think the feeling was shared squad-wide. Eventually, we sat round the fire, mid-morning I know but it was needed‚Ä¶

From the fire pit, I watched Sean on the ridge, staring toward the tourists‚Äô lodging. It did look better than here, wonder if he had showers. Sean, however, wasn‚Äôt thinking about the disparity in comfort between us and the VIPs. He was joining the dots. Whether I wanted to or not, so was I‚Ä¶

We sat together under the trees a little longer, chewing through scraps of rations and silence. Nobody spoke for a while‚Äî not until Petra made a dry comment about Reed trying to eat powdered coffee like it was trail mix.

He grunted something about ‚Äúrugby pre-season‚Äù and Sean laughed ‚Äî more out of obligation than amusement.

Then he went quiet.

And when Sean goes quiet, it‚Äôs usually because he‚Äôs about to monologue.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking,‚Äù he said.

There it was.

Sean leaned forward, his voice low but urgent. ‚ÄúCaptain, we have to find proof. He‚Äôs meeting someone today ‚Äî maybe we could listen in, maybe record it, anything.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt look at him at first. I just watched the trees swaying beyond the camp. ‚ÄúSean, we need to stay calm for now. The new squad‚Äôs nearly here. We have time.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut Captain,‚Äù he pressed, louder this time, ‚Äúit‚Äôs him. I *know* it. Every time he shows up, things go off the rails. The demon, the titan, the giant ‚Äî they all went berserk, and he was always right there in the middle of it. Doesn‚Äôt that bother you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt does,‚Äù I said, and that part was true. ‚ÄúMore than you know, but running into fire because it‚Äôs familiar doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll stop burning.‚Äù

He opened his mouth, probably to argue, but I turned and met his eyes. ‚ÄúSean. We‚Äôre with you. I promise. Just... slow down. Think this through, let us all catch up, we‚Äôll do this together.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt nod. Just lowered his head, biting back whatever was next.

Just then, a low rumble rolled through the air.

Another cargo plane dipped beneath the clouds, circled once, and came in hard on the runway, engines howling as it kicked up dust and gravel across the camp.

The hangar door flopped open.

Standing tall in the belly of the plane, framed by the dull grey of the hold and the glaring near afternoon in front of her was Emilie.

For a moment, I almost forgot how tired I was.

I stood, motioning for the others. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù

They all let out a collective groan like teenagers being told to do anything.

As we approached the ramp, I raised a hand. ‚ÄúEmilie. Honestly? It‚Äôs really good to see you.‚Äù

She looked me up and down like I‚Äôd grown a second head. ‚ÄúDid you hit your head on the way here?‚Äù¬† Glad to see the feeling was mutual‚Ä¶

Without missing a beat, she thumbed over her shoulder toward the cargo. ‚Äú Help us unload the trucks. This plane‚Äôs wheels-up in ten. Get the rest of your squad.‚Äù

I hesitated for just a second. ‚ÄúThis is it.‚Äù

She blinked, confused. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt react and just turned their poor, already exhausted faces.

‚ÄúYou heard her. Shift it.‚Äù

They peeled off wordlessly, walking like people twice their age. Asha moved stiffly. Petra didn‚Äôt even glance at Emilie ‚Äî she just staggered toward the truck bay with eyes hollow and unreadable. Even Reed looked like he'd completely dwindled as he slouched up to the wenches holding the trucks in place.

Emilie watched them go, arms still crossed.

Then it finally hit her.

Her posture shifted, shoulders easing just slightly. Her brow stayed furrowed, but the edge behind her stare dulled. She looked at each member individually as if she was counting and recounting.

Her voice, when she finally spoke again, had softened. Barely.

‚ÄúWe only need help with the trucks,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll handle the rest. Don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

The trucks rumbled off, brakes hissing as they eased into position. Tailgates groaned open on rusted hinges, and the ramps clanged down. Inside, stacked crates waited in dim, dust-lit rows ‚Äî the smell of old metal and fuel thick in the air.

The camp buzzed with movement. Orders barked over the drone of the engines. The dull metallic screech of wheels on tarmac. The sun hung low, casting long orange bars across the lot. Shadows stretched from the tires of the trucks and curled under the plane‚Äôs wings.

We moved in rhythm ‚Äî silent, efficient. Everyone knew the drill. No questions. Just motion.

Asha and Reed shifted crate after crate down from the truck beds to the flatbeds, their faces blank with practiced focus

Emilie was all command, finger-pointing and crisp orders. You wouldn‚Äôt know she‚Äôd just flown in from halfway across the world.

But there was a hitch in her tone, just a small one. Like something had caught in the gears.

She stepped aside, brushing dust from her cargo trousers with the back of her hand, probably wanting a break from all the noise. ¬†I joined her, the worst of the noise had died down and ¬†you could actually hear yourself think.

We watched the team finish tying off the last canvas cover.

‚ÄúCamp‚Äôs better than the last one,‚Äù she said casually. ‚ÄúFood‚Äôs edible. Beds look comfy. Sort of.‚Äù

I gave a faint snort. ‚ÄúA luxury.‚Äù

She nodded once, rubbing her shoulder absently. Then her voice dipped ‚Äî just a little ‚Äî beneath the noise. The kind of quiet reserved for things that mattered.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen the others in a while,‚Äù she said referring to the 4 other surviving members of rex squad.

I nodded.

She didn‚Äôt look at me, just at the gravel. Her voice turned distant. I chimed in.

‚ÄúHunter implied they are all still kicking around, ¬†doing well even. He wouldn‚Äôt tell me more, you know how he is.‚Äù

A silence stretched out between us. Familiar. Not awkward ‚Äî just old. Worn in like a uniform you never fully grew out of.

And then came the pause.

The one that let ghosts into the room.

‚ÄúI looked for him,‚Äù Emilie said. ‚ÄúAfter the fight. Hours. Couldn‚Äôt find him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù I replied

‚Äú You saw it too didn‚Äôt you, his face when they dragged him off ?‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúThere was no panic. Not angry. Just‚Ä¶ relieved.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. Didn‚Äôt need to.

She finally turned toward me.

‚ÄúI used to think you were just a sarcastic asshole. ¬†I mean you still are.‚Äù

I chuckled out of politeness

‚Äú I never understood why he picked you to be his second. Resented you for it. Thought you didn‚Äôt care about anyone but yourself.‚Äù

Her lips twitched, something between a smirk and a grimace.

‚ÄúBut seeing you with your squad ‚Äî I get it now. He was right to pick you‚Ä¶‚Äù

She reached down to her belt and unsnapped a pouch.

From inside, she drew a large, worn blade ‚Äî the kind you'd see in the Australian outback. Too personal. Too close-range.

‚ÄúI found this. Near the smaller titan. It was Rex‚Äôs. I think‚Ä¶ I think he held onto it when the others switched out their gear.‚Äù

She hesitated, like giving it up physically hurt. Then she held it out.

‚ÄúYou should have it.‚Äù

I took it. The weight of it settled into my palm like it remembered me.

I didn‚Äôt say thank you.

She didn‚Äôt expect me to.

For a second, we just stood there ‚Äî not as squad leads, not as survivors ‚Äî just as two people with the same ghost between them.

Then her voice shifted, sharpening like a blade returning to the sheath.

‚ÄúI need to tell you something. We weren‚Äôt sent to support you. We were sent to assess you. The Tourist says you‚Äôre plotting something.‚Äù

My stomach turned.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not doing something stupid, are you?‚Äù

I was still searching for an answer when Petra came sprinting across the tarmac, panic in her voice.

‚ÄúSean‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

We found his bag tucked behind the portable comms hub. Still warm.

The camp was quiet ‚Äî generator hum, distant birds, the occasional creak of canvas in the breeze.

Then‚Äî  
A single rifle crack. Distant. Too close.

We turned‚Äî

Sean came sprinting out from behind the VIP building, blood streaking down his shirt. His hand clutched his side, fingers slick with red. In the other, his tablet recorder ‚Äî the screen cracked, still glowing faintly.

‚ÄúCaptain‚Äî!‚Äù he shouted, stumbling toward us.

He didn‚Äôt make it far.

Halfway across the runway, his knees gave. He hit the ground hard, one palm catching him, the tablet skidding to the dirt.

He looked up, eyes locked on mine, wild and wet with pain as he crawled the remaining meters. I moved to help him as did Emilie.

‚ÄúI was right,‚Äù he wheezed. ‚ÄúHe was behind it. The giant‚Ä¶‚Äù

He coughed. A spray of red hit the dirt.

‚ÄúIntentional‚Ä¶‚Äù

We helped him back to his feet when from the tree line, Eban and the Tourist emerged.

‚ÄúHe tried to kill the VIP! Shoot him!!‚Äù

Then the Tourist, slow and silent, hands clasped behind his back like he was strolling through a museum.

The whole camp shifted. Not in movement ‚Äî in air.

It was like everything held its breath.

My squad froze by the trucks, halfway through unloading.

Emilie was near the plane. Still as a statue.

Sean was half on the ground, blood pooling beneath him. The recorder ¬†in his hand buzzed softly ‚Äî still on, still blinking red.

No one spoke. Even the wind stopped.

I looked across the gap between us and them.

Eban‚Äôs rifle was still pointed. But his stance was off ‚Äî he wasn‚Äôt certain. Not yet.

The Tourist simply stood there. Watching me. Calm. Detached. Like he‚Äôd seen all this before.

Emilie‚Äôs hand hovered at her hip.

She hadn‚Äôt drawn yet. But her fingers twitched near her holster. Thinking. Calculating.

I felt the weight of Rex‚Äôs knife in my grip. I hadn‚Äôt realized I‚Äôd drawn it.

Petra exhaled sharply beside me, just once. A controlled breath. Her right hand already resting lightly against her sidearm.

Reed didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt move. Just leaned slightly onto the crate ‚Äî the GPMG balanced and ready. His finger ghosted the trigger.

A breeze pushed through the camp. Hot and dry. It carried dust between us.

The Tourist blinked, then took a single step forward.

‚ÄúCaptain,‚Äù he said addressing Emilie , his voice low and clinical. ‚ÄúAs we feared ‚Äî they crossed a line. This was premeditated.‚Äù

I stepped forward.

‚ÄúEmilie‚Äî‚Äù

She drew and fired.

A clean shot. One round. Right between Sean‚Äôs eyes.

He collapsed backward ‚Äî arms slack, recorder slipping from his hand.

I didn‚Äôt feel my body do it.

Didn‚Äôt think. Just moved.

A wet *thuck*. Sharp intake of breath.

She staggered back, clutching her neck. Eyes wide, mouth open ‚Äî not in pain, not yet ‚Äî just confusion. Shock. Fingers smeared with red tried to hold it in, but the blood poured through like water through cracked glass.

Her knees buckled. She hit the ground hard.

And suddenly ‚Äî everything was noise.

Gunfire ripped through the camp, loud and close and without warning.

Someone shouted. Petra‚Äôs scream tore the air: ‚ÄúCOVER!‚Äù

I dropped to the gravel, and crawled to ¬†Petra and Reed behind some of the unloaded crates. But my eyes were still locked on Emilie. Her gaze found mine as she lay there choking, blinking furiously like she was still trying to process what happened. Not angry. Not afraid. Just‚Ä¶ sad.

Her hand reached for me, twitching.

Petra was beside me in a flash. She raised her pistol. Her hand shook.

‚ÄúLook away,‚Äù she ordered.

I couldn‚Äôt.

I watched anyway.

*Crack.*

Emilie stilled‚Ä¶

A scream broke through the chaos ‚Äî Reed‚Äôs. He was already braced against the bonnet of the truck, unloading the GPMG in long, punishing bursts. Brass casings scattered across the gravel like thrown coins.

The pepper of small arms fire ¬†as Emilie‚Äôs squad opened fire from the back of the cargo plane. Muzzle flashes lit the dimming air.

Eban was yelling something ‚Äî dragging the Tourist behind the fuselage, shielding him with his body. His partner took the opportunity to rush us, but was spotted by Reed and promptly gunned down. Upon seeing his partner‚Äôs death, Eban rushed for the trees almost abandoning the tourist in the process.

*Coward.*

I looked about and spotted Marcus waving and pointing behind us.

‚ÄúThe trucks!‚Äù I barked. My throat was raw. ‚ÄúGet to the fucking trucks!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Petra‚Äôs voice cracked.

‚ÄúTHE TRUCKS!‚Äù

Marcus and Asha moved first, no hesitation. Sprinting flat-out toward the nearest Land Rover. I saw Asha vault the side rail and roll across the back seat firing through the back window, as Marcus slammed the driver door closed behind him as the hum of the engine blessed my ears.

I made a B-line for Sean‚Äôs device. I snatched it, crammed it into my vest, and turned back just as Marcus and Asha frantically pleaded for us to move.

‚ÄúGo, go!‚Äù I yelled at Petra.

She grabbed my sleeve, frantic. ‚ÄúWhat about Reed?!‚Äù

I‚Äôd assumed he was already on his way there.

I turned, just in time to see Reed drop one of Emilie‚Äôs men with a roar, brass spilling like rain across the bonnet of the truck, poor bastard.

Blood coated his chest, his arm, his neck ‚Äî and yet he was still going, still feeding that GPMG like it was the only thing holding back the end of the world.

‚ÄúREED!‚Äù I shouted.

He glanced back, still reloading. ‚ÄúNah, bru. I‚Äôll follow you, yeah? Go on. I‚Äôm right behind.‚Äù

‚ÄúReed, double time it. That‚Äôs an order!‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt budge. Kept threading the new belt through the feed tray, slow and shaky. ‚ÄúI promise, boss.‚Äù

Something was wrong with the way he said it.

Too calm.

Too quiet.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lie to me, Reed.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when he turned ‚Äî just slightly ‚Äî and I saw it clearly.

His left ear was gone. Just shredded meat and blood. His shoulder was torn open, like someone had dug into it with claws. Half his chest glistened red in the firelight. His face, always so steady, was pale and drawn ‚Äî like the color had drained out in one long exhale.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm spent, boss,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù

His hands were shaking as he fed the belt through. Blood dripped down the grip.

But he smiled anyway. That same big, dumb, *Reed* smile ‚Äî the one that said everything would be okay, even when it wouldn‚Äôt.

His eyes were glassy.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in bit‚Ä¶ ‚Äù I shouted, holding back tears.

‚Ä¶his face lit up.

Pure joy.

‚ÄúFuck yeah you will, bru.‚Äù

Then he turned back to the fight. Braced the GPMG against his bleeding shoulder. And yelled at the top of his lungs:

‚ÄúCOME ON YE MOUTHY C#NTS!‚Äù

I turned and ran.

Petra was still sobbing as I pulled her into the backseat. The Land Rover was already skidding away, tires biting into dirt and blood.

‚ÄúGO!‚Äù

Marcus floored it. The truck jumped forward, weaving past burning tents and shattered crates.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

In the backseat, Petra pressed her face to the glass. Her hands trembled. Her whole body shook. She cried like something had broken inside her ‚Äî and kept crying.

Asha sat next to her, silent. Eyes wide. Staring out the opposite window, jaw clenched so tight it looked like it might crack.

Behind us, Reed‚Äôs gun opened fire again.

Loud. Raging. Furious.

It tore through the forest in long, rattling bursts.

Then another.

Then shorter.

Then, stopped...

No fade. No final burst. No struggle.

Just silence.

Like someone had flicked a switch.

The truck roared through the trees.

No one said a word.

Petra kept crying.

Asha didn‚Äôt blink.

Marcus didn‚Äôt look back.

I held Sean‚Äôs recorder in my lap like it might start bleeding too.

‚ÄúSee you soon, Reed,‚Äù

1m42hhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m42hhn/and_so_i_watch_you_from_afar/,And so I watch you from afar,"It started, as these things often do, with a simple noticing. A new tenant in the apartment across the courtyard. 4C. The one with the large window facing mine, framed by those slightly-too-short, gauzy curtains that never quite closed properly. You moved in on a Tuesday, hauling boxes that seemed too heavy for your frame. I remember how you looked on that Tuesday. Delicate bones beneath the effort, dark hair escaping the style you had been aiming for that hasteful morning, a few strands stuck to your temple with sweat. I was busy watering the small houseplant on my balcony. You glanced up, caught my eye, offered a quick, breathless smile. I smiled back.

That was all it took.

It wasn‚Äôt love at first sight. That‚Äôs just a lie people tell themselves to justify the inconvenient. No, it was curiosity. A spark that caught dry tinder in my soul I hadn‚Äôt even know was there. Who were you? Where did you come from? What made your eyes widen slightly when you looked at the city skyline from your balcony, like you were both thrilled and terrified? I had to know.

At first, it was casual. Glances while washing dishes. Noting your schedule. You left for work early, always rushing, coffee mug steaming in your hand. You came home late, shoulders slumped, sometimes carrying grocery bags that looked like they might split. You rarely drew your curtains fully at night. A slice of your life was perpetually on display: the warm glow of your lamp as you read on the faded blue couch, the flicker of your television as it painted shifting colours on the wall, the silhouette of you moving through the rooms ‚Äì brushing your hair, putting things away, standing still for moments at the window, looking out at the world beyond your little kingdom.

*Looking out.* But never, I noted with a strange mixture of disappointment and satisfaction, never really *seeing*.

I learned your routines. Mondays and Thursdays, yoga at 7 PM. You‚Äôd unroll a purple mat in the living room space visible from my vantage point. Sunday was laundry day. You hung things carefully on the small drying rack on your balcony. Practical cotton underwear, soft-looking t-shirts, one particular oversized grey sweater you seemed fond of. I was fond of it too. I noticed the brand of your detergent. Fresh linen. Clean.

I learned your loneliness. The way you‚Äôd sometimes sit on the sofa, phone in hand, staring at it for long minutes before putting it down without making a call. The way you always cooked single portions. The way you‚Äôd sometimes cry, shoulders shaking silently in the lamplight, face buried in your hands. I wanted to‚Ä¶ not comfort you, exactly. To acknowledge it, I think. To let you know someone saw the weight you carried. But distance was my ally. Distance was my shield.

I learned your small joys, too. The way you danced badly, wonderfully, when a particular song came on while you cooked. The way you‚Äôd curl up with a book and a mug of something steaming, completely absorbed. The way sunlight caught the gold flecks in your brown eyes when you stepped onto the balcony in the morning ‚Äì a detail visible only through my binoculars. Yes, binoculars. Birdwatching, I told myself. Urban birdwatching. And you were the most fascinating specimen of them all.

The more I watched, the more I knew you. Better than anyone else ever could. I knew you hated the shrill alarm on your phone; you‚Äôd smack it like it offended you personally. I knew you bit your lower lip when concentrating. I knew you favoured your left ankle slightly, an old injury perhaps. I knew the exact shade of pink that flushed your cheeks in the cold.

I knew you were vulnerable.

The courtyard between us became a sacred space, a theatre where your life unfolded just for me. The other apartments blurred into the background noise of the building. Only you mattered. Only your light in the darkness across from me. My own apartment felt like it receded, became merely a viewing platform, a nest. My life outside you ceased to hold meaning. Work became a tedious interruption between observations. Friends‚Äô voices became a drone I tuned out, impatient to get back to my window, to my vigil.

Do you understand? I wasn‚Äôt a monster. I wasn‚Äôt lurking in bushes or breathing down your neck. I was present. A constant, unseen guardian. I watched out for you. That man who lingered near the mailboxes a little too long a month ago? I noted his face, his build. I timed how long he stayed. Ready. Always ready. Because I knew your patterns. I knew when you were due home. If he‚Äôd made a move towards you as you rounded the corner, weighed down with shopping bags, I‚Äôd have tracked him down to the ends of the earth if I had to. I‚Äôd have taken a pair of pliers and pulled every tooth in his sick skull. I‚Äôd have cut out his tongue. I‚Äôd get a hammer and shatter every single finger on his hands. I‚Äôd have gotten my hands on a gun, and shot him in the kneecaps. No vital organs. Just pure pain. Then I‚Äôd have ripped out his fingernails and stabbed his eyes and then I‚Äôd have put a bullet in his brain.

He left before you arrived back home. But I was *watching*. Keeping you safe.

My presence was a gift. A silent devotion. I curated your privacy by observing it so minutely. I saw the *real* you, the unguarded moments no one else was privileged to witness. Didn‚Äôt that intimacy, however one-sided, create a bond? A deeper connection than the superficial chats you might have with someone in the elevator?

Of course, there were escalations. Necessary ones. To understand you fully. Your Wi-Fi password was easy to guess ‚Äì your cat‚Äôs name followed by your birth year, gleaned from a discarded envelope in the recycling dumpster I checked one collection day. All of a sudden, your digital life opened like a flower in bloom. Your Amazon orders. Your tentative messages to an old friend that always seemed to fizzle out. Your hesitant searches for therapists in the area. Your playlists, full of melancholic indie and folk that perfectly soundtracked my observations.

It wasn‚Äôt spying. It was‚Ä¶ context. Filling in the beautiful, intricate details of the painting I was gazing upon.

Then came the day you brought *him* home.

A Friday night. You were dressed differently. Brighter. Nervous energy crackled around you even from across the courtyard. He was tall, with loud laughter that carried faintly across the space, hands that lingered too familiarly on your arm as you unlocked your door. My blood turned to ice. Who was he? What right did he have?

I watched, rigid at my post, binoculars forgotten on the table beside me, my naked eyes straining through the dusk. I saw the bottle of wine opened. I saw you sitting close on the couch, his arm draped around you. I saw you lean in for a kiss.

I turned away. The betrayal was physical, a punch to the gut. How could you? After the silent communion we shared? This, this interloper. This *stranger*. He didn‚Äôt know you. Not like I did. He didn‚Äôt see the way your fingers trembled slightly when you were anxious. He didn‚Äôt know about the scar just below your left collarbone, visible when you wore that loose tank top. He hadn‚Äôt witnessed your silent tears or your terrible, wonderful dancing.

He stayed the night.

I didn‚Äôt sleep. I sat in the dark, the only light in the dim, mocking glow coming from your window. I listened to the muffled sounds of the city, straining to hear anything from your apartment. Silence. Then, finally, the soft click of your door closing as he left early the next morning. You stood in the doorway, wrapped in a robe, watching him go. You looked satisfied.

That was the day the distance became unbearable. Watching wasn‚Äôt enough. I needed proximity. I needed you to feel the weight of my observation, to understand the depth of my commitment.

It was surprisingly straightforward. Your building‚Äôs main door lock was faulty. A simple credit slipped in just right, and I was in. The stairwell smelled of dust and mould. Your door, 4C, felt warm under my fingertips. I didn‚Äôt go in. Not then. That would be crude. A violation. Instead, I pressed my ear against the wood. I heard the soft clatter of dishes from within. The murmur of your radio. The sound of your breath, just on the other side of the thin barrier. You never said anything, but that was fine. I would take your silence over anyone else‚Äôs voice.

Later, I found something better. A loose floorboard in the poorly lit hallway alcove near the fire escape. A perfect hiding spot. I could be closer. I could listen. I could wait.

I started leaving things. Small things. Innocuous. A single, perfect white pebble outside your door. A sprig of lavender tucked into the frame of your mailbox out in the courtyard. A postcard of a place I thought you‚Äôd like ‚Äì a quiet seaside town. It was left blank. No message needed. You‚Äôd understand it was from someone who *knew*. Someone who cared.

But you didn‚Äôt understand. I saw the confusion on your face when you found the pebble. The slight frown at the lavender. The way you glanced around the hallway after finding the postcard, a flicker of unease in your eyes before you shrugged it off. You were missing the point. The *intimacy*.

The frustration grew. The distance mocked me. I needed a gesture you couldn‚Äôt ignore. Something that spoke of my profound connection to your essence.

I waited for you to go to bed. I knew you‚Äôd be asleep fast. I chose your yoga night; I knew you were always so tired those nights. The faulty main door yielded again and I went up the stairs. Then I picked your lock.

Stepping into your apartment was like stepping into a sacred chapel. It smelled like you ‚Äì that clean linen detergent, faint perfume, the ghost of coffee. Your presence was thick in the air. I‚Äôd journeyed far and wide to this domain. Voyaged across stairwells that formed mountains and marshes of trash and knocked down doors and climbed in windows and listened, listened, listened, and now here I was in your apartment. There was a universe in that room, and in contrast it made me feel like a scrounger of toilets, a pillage of tombs. I moved silently, a shadow among your shadows. I saw the book you were reading on the arm of the couch. The half-empty mug on the coffee table. The grey sweater draped over a chair.

My heart hammered, a frantic percussion against my ribs. Not with fear, but with reverence. And possession.

I didn‚Äôt touch much. Just one thing. From the small, carved box on your dresser where I knew you kept your jewellery. A single strand of your dark hair, caught in a tangle. I slipped it into the tiny glass vial I‚Äôd brought in my back pocket, just in case.

A relic.

A tangible piece of you.

As I retreated, I saw it. Your hairbrush on the bathroom counter. Filled with strands of dark hair. I knew what I was supposed to do. My offering. My proof. I carefully removed all the hair from the brush, leaving it starkly clean. In its place, I left the glass vial containing the single strand. Centred perfectly on the cool porcelain.

*‚ÄúSee?‚Äù* I thought, melting back into the hallway, the faulty door clicking shut softly behind me. *‚ÄúSee how close I can get? See how well I know your space, your solitude?‚Äù*

I returned to my window across the courtyard. Minutes later, you woke up. I saw the lights come on and saw you groggily drift to the bathroom. Saw you stop dead in the doorway. Saw you pick up the vial. Saw the colour drain from your face as you stared at it. Saw you spin around, looking wildly around your apartment, then rushing to your window, peering out into the darkness, your eyes wide with dawning, terrified comprehension.

You looked right towards my building. Right towards my dark window.

You couldn‚Äôt see me, of course. I am very good at being unseen. But you *felt* it now, didn‚Äôt you? The weight. The constant, patient presence. The utter lack of distance that truly mattered.

A slow, overjoyed smile touched my lips. There it was. That connection, finally acknowledged. The fear was regrettable, but necessary. It was the first real emotion you‚Äôd ever truly directed towards me. Raw. Unfiltered. Beautiful in its own patchwork way.

You clutched the vial like a talisman against the evil eye, backing away from your window, quickly drawing those inadequate curtains tight. But it was too late. The veil was torn.

You‚Äôll call the police, probably. They‚Äôll come. They‚Äôll ask questions. They might even patrol for a night or two. But they won‚Äôt find anything. I am careful. I am the man who blends in. The quiet neighbour. The one who keeps to himself. They‚Äôll tell you to get better locks, maybe an alarm. They‚Äôll say it was probably just kids, just a prank. They‚Äôll leave.

And you‚Äôll sit in your apartment, heart pounding, jumping at every creak, constantly checking the locks, peering fearfully out through gaps in the curtains. You‚Äôll feel it. That prickle on the back of your neck. The certainty that somewhere in the darkness, unseen, unblinking eyes are fixed upon you.

You‚Äôll know, deep in your bones, that you are not alone. That you never really were.

Because I am here. Observing. Understanding. Existing. Closer than you can possibly imagine.

# Best Dental Polishing Kit 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Dental health is paramount for overall well-being, and a luminous, clean smile contributes significantly to confidence and self-esteem. A dental polishing kit allows individuals to maintain their oral hygiene effectively at home, complementing professional dental cleanings.

These kits are designed to remove surface stains, plaque, and debris, leading to healthier gums and a more radiant smile. Selecting the right dental polishing kit can be challenging,with numerous options available in the market. This thorough guide provides in-depth reviews and key considerations to help you choose the best dental polishing kit in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a dental polishing kit hinges on its features and components.A well-designed kit incorporates user-friendly tools and high-quality polishing agents to deliver optimal results without causing damage to the teeth or gums.

**Polishing Handpiece Ergonomics**

A well-designed polishing handpiece is essential for cozy and effective use.The ergonomics of the handpiece determine how easily it can be maneuvered within the mouth and how much control the user has during polishing. Look for handpieces with a lightweight design and a comfortable grip to avoid fatigue during longer polishing sessions. Features such as variable speed settings and a swivel head can also enhance usability.**Polishing Cups and Brush Attachments**

The quality and variety of polishing cups and brush attachments are crucial for achieving thorough and even polishing. Different cup shapes and sizes are designed for various tooth surfaces, ensuring that all areas receive adequate attention. soft rubber cups are gentler on the gums, while firmer cups can be used for more stubborn stains. Brushes are useful for reaching into interdental spaces and removing debris. High-quality materials are important to prevent shedding or damage during use.**Polishing Paste Composition**

The polishing paste used in the kit should be effective in removing stains and plaque but gentle enough to avoid damaging the enamel. Look for pastes that contain mild abrasives such as pumice or perlite. The paste should also be fluoride-infused to provide additional protection against cavities. Avoid pastes with harsh chemicals or excessive abrasiveness, as these can lead to tooth sensitivity and enamel erosion. The ideal paste should have a smooth consistency and a pleasant flavor to enhance the overall experience.

**LED Illumination**

Integrated LED illumination in the handpiece provides enhanced visibility during the polishing process. Good lighting is essential for ensuring that all areas of the teeth are properly cleaned and that no spots are missed. The LED light should be bright and focused to illuminate the treatment area without causing glare or discomfort.Some kits offer adjustable light intensity settings to accommodate different lighting conditions and user preferences.

**Battery Life and Charging**

For cordless dental polishing kits, battery life and charging time are important considerations. A longer battery life allows for extended polishing sessions without the need for frequent recharging. Look for kits that offer at least 60 minutes of continuous use on a single charge. The charging process should be convenient and efficient, with a clear indicator of charging status. Some kits come with a charging dock or stand for easy storage and charging.

**Sterilization and Hygiene**

Maintaining proper hygiene is crucial when using a dental polishing kit. The components of the kit, such as the handpiece and attachments, should be easy to clean and sterilize.Look for kits that include autoclavable components or that can be easily disinfected with alcohol wipes. Proper sterilization procedures help prevent the spread of bacteria and ensure the safety of both the user and the kit.

## Core Benefits

A high-quality dental polishing kit offers several benefits, contributing to improved oral hygiene, enhanced aesthetics, and increased self-confidence. These benefits extend beyond the superficial, promoting long-term dental health and well-being.

**Enhanced Stain Removal:** A dental polishing kit effectively removes surface stains caused by coffee, tea, tobacco, and othre staining agents. This results in a brighter, whiter smile and a more aesthetically pleasing appearance. Regular polishing can also prevent the buildup of stubborn stains that are challenging to remove with regular brushing.

**Improved Plaque Control:** Polishing helps remove plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces, reducing the risk of cavities, gum disease, and bad breath. The polishing action disrupts the formation of plaque biofilms, making it easier to maintain a healthy oral habitat. This is especially beneficial for individuals who are prone to plaque buildup or who have difficulty reaching certain areas of their mouth with a toothbrush.

**Smoother Tooth Surfaces:** Polishing creates a smoother tooth surface,which makes it more difficult for plaque and bacteria to adhere. This helps to reduce the risk of tooth decay and gum inflammation. Smoother teeth also feel cleaner and more comfortable. The polishing process can also help to remove minor surface irregularities, further enhancing the smoothness of the teeth.

**healthier Gums:** By removing plaque and debris from the gumline,dental polishing helps to promote healthier gums and prevent gingivitis. The polishing action stimulates the gums, improving circulation and reducing inflammation. This is particularly important for individuals with sensitive gums or who are prone to gum disease.

**Increased Confidence:** A brighter, cleaner smile can significantly boost self-confidence and improve overall well-being. Knowing that your teeth are healthy and aesthetically pleasing can positively impact social interactions and personal relationships. the confidence that comes with a healthy smile can also translate to improved professional performance and overall life satisfaction.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about dental polishing kits can help consumers make informed decisions and use the kits effectively.Understanding the proper techniques and precautions is essential for achieving optimal results and avoiding potential risks.

**How often should I use a dental polishing kit?**
The frequency of use depends on individual needs and preferences.However, it's generally recommended to use a dental polishing kit no more than once or twice a month. Over-polishing can damage the enamel and cause tooth sensitivity. If you have specific concerns about stain buildup or plaque control, consult with your dentist to determine the best frequency for your individual situation.

**Are dental polishing kits safe for enamel?**

When used correctly,dental polishing kits are generally safe for enamel.Though, it's critically important to use a kit with a mild abrasive paste and to avoid excessive pressure during polishing. Prolonged or aggressive polishing can erode the enamel and lead to tooth sensitivity. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions and use a soft touch to minimize the risk of enamel damage.

**Can dental polishing kits replace professional dental cleanings?**

No, dental polishing kits are not a substitute for professional dental cleanings. While thay can definitely help remove surface stains and plaque, they cannot remove hardened tartar or address underlying dental issues. professional dental cleanings involve scaling, root planing, and a comprehensive examination of your oral health, which cannot be replicated at home. Regular professional cleanings are essential for maintaining long-term dental health.

**What should I do if my teeth become sensitive after polishing?**

If you experience tooth sensitivity after polishing, discontinue use and consult with your dentist. Sensitivity can be caused by enamel erosion or gum recession.Your dentist can evaluate your condition and recommend appropriate treatment options, such as fluoride treatments or desensitizing toothpaste. In some cases, sensitivity may resolve on its own within a few days.

We‚Äôve always used Berkley filters because of the lack of trust in tap water but I had absolutely no idea about the various things city water is exposed to and filling up the Berkley and maintaining the filters was getting old. So caught the Spring Well whole house water filtration system on sale and couldn‚Äôt pass the opportunity up. Installed by professional plumbers in my encapsulated crawlspace with a Home Master RO under the sink. This is the first time in my life I‚Äôve ever experienced soft water and I have to say I wish I would have done it sooner.

The taste of the water from the RO is addicting and has sent my morning coffee experience to the next level. The peace of mind I‚Äôve gained from all of this is priceless. What a game changer!

1m428cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m428cr/what_is_a_cordless_electric_kettle/,What is a cordless electric kettle?,"Have you ever found yourself in need of hot water quickly, whether for tea, coffee, or instant noodles? I used to struggle with this daily until I discovered the magic of cordless electric kettles. These handy devices have become a game-changer in my kitchen, and I'm excited to share why.

A cordless electric kettle is a portable appliance designed to heat water efficiently without being tethered to a power outlet. It consists of two main parts: a heating base that plugs into the wall and a removable kettle that sits on top. This design allows you to lift the kettle off its base and pour hot water wherever you need it, without worrying about cords getting in the way.

One of the biggest advantages of these kettles is their speed. They can bring water to a boil much faster than traditional stovetop methods. This means less waiting around in the morning when you're rushing to make that first cup of coffee. Plus, many models come with automatic shut-off features, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to turn it off.

Another great thing about cordless electric kettles is their energy efficiency. They use less electricity than boiling water on a stove, which can help lower your energy bills over time. Some even have different temperature settings, perfect for brewing various types of tea that require specific water temperatures.

These kettles come in various sizes and styles to fit different needs and kitchen decors. Whether you want a small one for your office desk or a larger one for family gatherings, there's likely a model that's right for you. Many are made with durable materials like stainless steel or heat-resistant glass, making them both stylish and long-lasting.

Safety is another key feature of cordless electric kettles. Unlike stovetop kettles, there's no open flame involved, reducing the risk of accidents. The automatic shut-off function I mentioned earlier also prevents the kettle from boiling dry, which can be dangerous with traditional kettles.

Cleaning these kettles is usually pretty simple too. Most have wide openings that make it easy to reach inside and wipe down. Some even have removable filters to catch any mineral deposits, especially helpful if you live in an area with hard water.

If you're considering getting a cordless electric kettle, there are a few things to keep in mind. Look for one with a comfortable handle and a spout that pours smoothly to avoid spills. Also, check the capacity to make sure it meets your needs ‚Äì whether you're usually making tea for one or boiling water for a family-sized pot of pasta.

After using a cordless electric kettle for a while now, I can't imagine going back to my old stovetop method. It's made my daily routine so much more convenient. If you're interested in trying one out for yourself, I've found a great selection at https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They have options for every budget and need.

In conclusion, a cordless electric kettle is a simple yet powerful tool that can make a big difference in your kitchen. It's fast, efficient, safe, and versatile ‚Äì perfect for anyone who regularly needs hot water without the hassle. Whether you're a tea enthusiast, a busy parent, or just someone who appreciates convenience, it's definitely worth considering adding one to your kitchen arsenal.",1,1752946951.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

Chapter 3,"After that strange situation-which I still can't explain-people began heading to their homes, while Valeria and the others took their bikes along with some other supplies I assume were water, food, and perhaps flashlights.

Some folks, however, stayed outside-perhaps searching for those who went missing. I didnt had much faith that they'll be found. I don't want to sound like a heartless bastard, but if everything that happened to me also happened to them, then...

I uh i think I heard footsteps inside the house just in first floor. I had to stop writing and stay silent. I don't know if it was paranoia or if my mind was playing tricks on me. It could be them... but the light hasn't fully faded yet, so there's no chance they'd be able to get inside during the sunlight.

I don't hear anything anymore-for now. Michael and I headed toward my house. I asked if he could stay the night, and he didn't object; he'd had a similar idea anyway. I guess neither of us wanted to be alone tonight after everything that happened. I just had to make sure he didn't go upstairs and see the dried blood for now. As for the shotgun, I'd explain that I had it taken out... just in case. Along the way, Michael tried to lift the mood with his usual jokes-like ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" or some dark humor he'd always pull out when tension filled the air. But this time, I only managed a fake smile or forced laugh. Even though I used to at least chuckle at them... now, I just couldn't.

As much as I tried to think of something else, my mind kept slipping back to the memories of last night. ""As we arrived home, I let Michael go first. Once we were both inside, I closed the door, and as it shut, Michael turned to me and spoke.""

""Alright, Jackie, we've known each other for a few years now-and I can already tell something's wrong. It's not just this situation, or you claiming you didn't sleep well. Something bad happened to you, man... What is it?"" Michael asked..

I probably should've figured he'd eventually see through my camouflage.'I thought to myself'.

""Ugh, Michael, it's not anything serious, I just......"" I stopped. I probably already knew he wouldn't believe a word if I said something like, ""It's nothing. This whole situation is just messed up,"" or, ""I just had some nightmares.""

""Do you promise you won't see me as someone who escaped from an asylum if I tell you?""

Michael nodded with his arms crossed. ""I think I can handle whatever you throw at me. Go on, I'm listening."" He probably wanted to add a cheeky remark, but stopped himself near the end of the sentence.

I took a deep breath and motioned for him to follow me upstairs. As we walked upstairs, I began explaining what had happened last night. When I mentioned the disappearance of the police officers, his face turned confused. Honestly, I'd probably look just as bewildered if someone told me the cops who'd visited me had suddenly vanished into the void.

Michael....So you're telling me that you saw the police officers who were supposed to show up yesterday-but never did-right in front of your house, and then they just vanished... like my money after payday?"" he said with a hint of dry humor, only to realize this indeed probably wasn't the best time for jokes.

I didn't react to his joke, and I think he probably realized it wasn't the right time for it. His expression shifted instantly when we arrived to my bedroom, i letted the door open so he dosent see that scarch marks... and revealed the dried pool of blood on the floor.

He stood there frozen, staring at the dried blood-probably with no idea what to say.

""Fucking hell..."" That's all he managed to say, his voice trembling with disbelief and unease. To be honest, that was the first time I'd seen him like that-stunned, speechless, and completely at a loss for what to even think.

""J-Jackie... is this...?""he mumbled

""Yeah,"" I nodded slowly. ""It's blood,"" I said with a sigh.

He turned slowly toward me, eyes scanning my face-probably trying to figure out if the blood was mine, if I was hurt or anything. ""Is it yours, Jackie? Are you hurt?"" he asked, now slightly worried.

""No, it's not mine. Don't worry,"" I said quickly. ""It's... uhm..."" I trailed off, struggling to find the right words.

""Michael..."" I said, not really prepared to tell the truth. ""There was something in my house last night... not just police officers outside, but something else too."" Michael's face shifted into unease at my words. I imagined anyone would react the same way-hearing that their friend or family member had someone, or something, inside their house.

""What do you mean, something?"" Michael asked, dread clearly creeping over him with every passing second.

My eyes shut, damp with the weight of what I was about to say. ""I... I think it was Amanda, Michael,"" I whispered, opening them slowly. I didn't know what to expect from him when I said Amanda's name. Given the blood and my shaky nerves, I wouldn't blame him for thinking I'd done something to her... maybe even something worse.

Michael froze, his mouth hanging open. ""Amanda... you mean..."" He paused, swallowing hard, searching for the right words. ""The Amanda who vanished? The one the entire village was out looking for? She was here?""

I nodded slowly, dread curling in my chest. ""Y-yes... but it wasn't Amanda anymore, Michael. She was... something else."" I sucked in a sharp breath. No more holding back. If he thought I was insane or delusional, fine. I had to say it. I needed to say it.

""Yes, it was Amanda. I know it was her."" My voice trembled. ""She broke into my house, and I thought she was trying to hurt me. God, Michael... she was running on all fours. Her pupils were gone, her tongue was fucking gone, and her limbs were twisted-unnaturally twisted.""

I swallowed hard, the memory clawing at me. ""I hid in my room with a shotgun and locked the door, but she got in. And I...""

My voice cracked. I could feel the tears threatening. ""I think I almost started crying... and I shot her.""

""I... I shot her.""

I stepped back, collapsed onto my bed, broken. ""I was just so scared, Michael. I didn't know what to do."" I was just so fucking scared..

In a situation like this, most people would think I'd just had too much to drink, or maybe a horrific, twisted nightmare. Some might even assume I'd taken something. They wouldn't believe a word of it.

But not Michael. Not him.

He looked at the pool of blood one last time, then sighed quietly. Without saying anything, he walked over and sat beside me.

I didn't dare look him in the face.

He just sat there, staring down at the floor, silent.He folded his arms across his chest, silent for a moment longer. Then, without looking at me, he said the last thing I ever thought I'd hear.

""I believe you.""

At those words, my eyes widened in disbelief. I couldn't believe it. After everything I'd told him-everything that would sound like pure nonsense to anyone else-he actually believed me.

""You're serious? You actually believe everything I just told you?"" I looked at him, my expression full of disbelief.

""Well... yeah, I do. I believe you,"" he said, voice low. ""Because I know you'd never lie about something like this. And honestly, considering everything that just happend... it makes it even more believable.""

He hesitated. ""I... I didn't know if I was going crazy, but last night... I think something was in my house too.""

At that moment, I saw him shiver. A flicker of fear passed through him. ""

""Last night, after the whole fiasco surrounding Amanda's disappearance, I had to calm my mind with a bottle of beer. For the next few hours, everything seemed fine-just like any other day, you know? But around 8:00 p.m., I heard some sounds coming from the second floor. At first, I didn't react; I just kept listening, trying to figure out if what I'd heard was real. Still, I was slightly on edge. I thought maybe it was just... I don't know, my imagination. Then, another sound came-but this time, I recognized it: footsteps. Slow, but heavy, coming from the second floor.

""I froze, still sitting on the couch. I hadn't turned around-at least not yet. I just... I was paralyzed by that simple sound. Then came more: heavy footsteps, less human and more like those of a large animal. But they didn't head downstairs where I was. I think I heard doors being opened... and closed. Like... like it was searching for someone-or something.""

""I kept listening to Michael's story, and my heart was beating faster with every word. He genuinely sounded terrified. And honestly, I couldn't blame him. The more I think about it, the more I realize-he was probably lucky to have survived in one piece.""

""He said that, despite the fear, he slowly stood up. Carefully-quietly-he placed the bottle onto the couch, trying to keep the sound to a minimum. At that moment, soaking the cushions was the least of his worries. But instead of heading upstairs to investigate, he moved slowly toward the kitchen, his intentions unmistakable. Even though it wasn't far, the short walk felt like miles. Every step was deliberate, every sound magnified, as he tried to stay as silent as possible.""

""Luckily, he reached the kitchen without making a sound. Carefully, he opened a drawer and took out the biggest knife he could find. But as he pulled it free, the blade scraped across another, producing a faint clink. Michael clenched his teeth and shut his eyes for a moment. Luckily... he heard nothing in response. That's when he realized-he wasn't hearing anything at all. No more footsteps. No more doors opening. Just silence.""

""That confused me,"" Michael said. He had alcohol in his system, sure, but he swore he really heard those footsteps upstairs. He thought about calling the police-but what if he was just drunk and nothing was actually up there? How would he even explain it to them? I doubted the phone would work anyway.""

""He decided to check it out, just to be sure. His sweaty palms gripped the knife firmly as he crept toward the stairs, trying to make as little noise as possible. But the higher he climbed, the more the lights began to flicker. At first, it confused him-just a brief glitch, maybe? But with every step closer to the second floor, the flickering grew more intense. By the time he reached the top, the lights stuttered so violently it was nearly impossible to see.""

""As he finally stepped onto the second floor, the flickering stopped. The hallway looked... normal-well-lit, quiet, and untouched. No sign of an intruder. But Michael felt it. Something was off. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but the air felt heavier. He quickened his pace, gripping the knife tightly, and began opening doors one by one. First, the bathroom: cloaked in darkness but empty. Then, his bedroom: again, nothing. Finally, he approached the guest room-the one he rarely used.""

""He opened the door, tightened his grip on the knife, and flicked on the light. The guest room looked just as he'd left it-cozy, untouched. He stepped inside and started scanning the space. That's when he noticed the window. It was open. He was certain he hadn't left it that way. A slight frown formed as he cautiously approached. Peering outside, he saw... nothing. Just darkness and stillness.""

""After that, Michael fell silent. He looked up slightly, then glanced around the room like he was afraid something-or someone-might overhear. His eyes darted across the walls before finally turning to me. And then, in a voice edged with unease, he said: 'Jackie... when I turned around, I... I saw something. Something I can't... explain.'""

""Was it Amanda?"" I asked, thinking that he'd seen the same thing I had.

""Michael slowly shook his head and said... no.""

""I saw... I saw something else..."" At those words, my eyes widened slightly in fear. ""W... what did you see?""

""Michael said that when he closed the window and looked back, the hallway was shrouded in darkness. But that wasn't the worst part... The worst part was that, when he looked a little closer, he saw something in it.""

""He couldn't see it clearly, but he knew-there was a figure standing in the hallway, right in front of his door. But... something was off. Something strange, something that-even now-fills my body with terror, knowing that it's still out there... somewhere. And I know that the thing... whatever it was... it had also been in my garden that night.""

""The strange thing was that, unlike the way Amanda looked, this figure-according to his description-was on a completely different level of horror. He said it was tall... really tall. So tall, in fact, he couldn't even see its head through the doorway, only part of its neck. He admitted he might've been glad he hadn't seen its face. Still, it didn't move. It just stood there. It looked disturbingly thin, which made the heavy footsteps even more unsettling. Possibly the worst part was its limbs: unnaturally skinny, and far too long for a human. He swore its hands could probably touch the floor even while standing upright. He couldn't tell if it could see him. It was staring directly at the wall above the door-or... maybe it was doing something else entirely.""

In fear, he stepped back slightly, his hands trembling-until the floor beneath him creaked. He froze, eyes wide. If that thing hadn't been aware of him before... it definitely was now. Despite the light still being on in the room, it did nothing to ease the unease. Then, slowly, it began to lean down so it can fit to door. One of its hands gripped the edge of the doorframe, and in the light, he could see it clearly-long, dirty, broken nails... and skin. Skin as black as ash, torn in places, revealing ragged patches of raw flesh.

""His heart was pounding so wildly, he thought it might give out. He even said he nearly forgot to breathe."" 

But before the creature could reveal itself in full, it froze mid-lean. That's when he heard it-a new sound. Scratching. The soft, unmistakable sound of claws or nails scraping against something-coming from the lower floor. And the way the creature stopped... it seemed like it heard it too.

'Scratching?' I asked, and Michael nodded, his expression grim and distant. He said the creature had paused-Its long, disfigured fingers, tipped with jagged, earth-stained nails, digged into the wall. The sound was faint but unmistakable: a slow, deliberate scrape, like bone dragged across plaster. The creature seemed to savor the moment, its hand lingering before withdrawing. Then it straightened, limbs impossibly thin but unnaturally fluid.

Despite its skeletal frame, it moved with shocking force-charging toward the sound below with a burst of speed that made Michael stagger. The scratching ceased instantly. Heavy, thunderous footsteps shook the air. Michael froze, listening as the sound transformed-overlapped-smaller, lighter steps now trailing behind. 

Then the back door exploded open, 

And then-complete silence.

""He said that after that, he quickly ran to the door, slammed it shut, locked it, and stayed there the entire night with the knife in his hand. He barely slept. By morning, the memories were still lingering... though he wasn't sure if any of it had really happened.""

""Once he gathered the courage to head downstairs, the house felt unusually cold. Later, he realized why-the door leading to the garden had been left open. But that wasn't the strangest part. He noticed marks on the wall-marks that looked like scratches made by nails. Only... they weren't just random scratches, he said. They formed a word. A word carved into the surface by something unnatural. It said...""

Leave...i finsihed his sentance.

Michael looked at me, surprised. ""Yes... h-how do you know that?"" he asked.

I gestured for him to follow me and led him toward the door. Once we reached it, I closed it-to reveal the same markings. Michael froze. Before he could say a word, I spoke. ""Michael... I think whatever was in your house was also in my garden. And the scratching... it was Amanda. I think she was trying to warn us... about- it.""

Michael stared at the markings, then looked at me. ""You mean... those same markings in my house-they were made by it? And she... she was trying to warn us?""*

""I'm not completely sure... but it's the only explanation I have. I think the thing inside your house was searching for her-and you were just in its way. But Amanda... she caught its attention. And she left us that message.""

""We have to warn the others,"" I said. But Michael looked skeptical. ""And what exactly should we tell them? That Amanda-who turned into a monster-returned in the middle of the night to warn us about something else out there? I believe it... I really do. But I don't think they'd ever believe us.""

""Even now, I'm not sure if other people would actually believe us-or if they just saw us as crazy. But back then, I thought they might at least consider everything: the dead cars, the broken phones... the missing people.

""We have to at least try, Michael. We might all be in danger-as crazy as it sounds. What are we supposed to do? Just sit on our asses and act like nothing happened?""

Michael shook his head. ""Of course not... but what if they think we're somehow connected to Amanda's disappearance?""

I think he had a point back then. I just had this strange feeling-like something bad was going to happen... And I was right.

Michael placed a hand over his forehead, thinking hard, before finally speaking.

""Well... at least we can try asking if something similar has happened to them. If they've experienced anything like this, then maybe-maybe-it's safe to tell them at least half the truth.""**

""That sounded fair enough. It felt like the more logical choice-rather than running around telling everyone there's a monster stalking houses and hunting for Amanda.""

It was settled then. We headed downstairs, about to leave the house. As I passed the clock, I glanced at it-14:00. But just as Michael opened the front door, he stumbled back in fright. A man was standing right outside. It was Freddy. holding his crooked staff-the same man who had claimed he saw a figure outside Amanda's house the night she disappeared.

Michael clutched his chest and took a deep breath. ""Fucking hell, Freddy-you scared the shit out of me, man.""

**Freddy apologized for the scare-and for showing up unannounced. I stepped closer, eyeing him suspiciously. Could this be another trick? But nothing strange ever seemed to happen during the daytime...

Then he hit us with these words. Something we didn't expect.

""You two have seen something too, haven't you?""**

It completely caught us off guard. We looked at each other, unsure what to say-also wondering how the hell Freddy could've known. I answered cautiously, suspicion lacing my voice. ""H... how do you know that?""

Michael crossed his arms slowly, his eyes narrowing just enough to show he was just as on edge.

""You're not the only ones seeing things, young lads,"" Freddy said. ""For the past few hours, I've seen things I can't quite explain...""

So it was true. This nightmare wasn't just ours.

Michael, however, answered quicker than I did. ""So you've seen weird things too, huh? Well, welcome to the band.""

There was a flicker of dry humor in his voice-an instinctive shield against the tension clawing at all of us. But his expression betrayed no smile. He was serious. Leaning slightly forward, eyes locked onto Freddy's, he continued with low urgency.

""Listen-we think something bad might be coming. Something bigger than all this weirdness. The dead phones, the missing people, even Amanda's disappearance-they aren't just coincidences. There's a pattern forming, and it's not random.""

Freddy's grip on his staff tightened, his knuckles whitening ever so slightly.

He glanced around, scanning the empty street to make sure we were alone. Then he said it-low and serious. ""Follow me.""

I hesitated. ""Why?"" I asked.

Freddy didn't blink.

""I might know something.""

Michael and I exchanged a look. That quiet, wordless kind that spoke volumes. We both nodded.

""Alright,"" I said, stepping back toward the hallway. ""But hold up-let me grab my shotgun.""

Freddy stopped me, raising his voice just enough to catch my attention. ""I don't think that's necessary, my boy,"" he said.

But I didn't stop walking.

""I insist,"" I called over my shoulder. ""It might come in handy.""

Freddy sighed, his grip tightening slightly on his staff.

""Alright,"" he muttered. ""But be quick about it.

I quickly headed to the living room where my shotgun was still lying on the couch. I grabbed it, and before going back, I opened the drawer where I kept the rest of my ammo. There were only four rounds-I never thought I'd need more. I snatched them up, quickly reloaded, and returned to Michael and Freddy after two minutes.

""Finally,"" Freddy said. ""Thought I spent the rest of my pension here.""

Michael looked at me holding the shotgun and gave a firm nod. Freddy grunted, ""Alright, let's not waste any time, follow me.

I closed the door, and with that, the three of us headed toward Freddy's house. The streets, however, were completely empty-not a single soul in sight, and no sounds except the echo of our footsteps. A strange chill hung in the air. It felt like we'd stepped into a ghost town.

Freddy's house was only three minutes away, a short walk that once felt like a stroll through the heart of a living neighborhood. The streets had always been full of life-children darting between parked cars,laughing; neighbors huddled near fences, swapping stories and gossip; someone perched on a worn wooden bench, sipping coffee and soaking in the warmth of the day.

But now, that familiar vibrancy had evaporated. No voices. No movement. The air itself seemed hollow.

Even as I write this, it makes me miss those old times- times of normal life, when the streets were full of joy, and not... well, not this.

I'd give anything to have those days back. But its gone now.

As we finally arrived at Freddy's house-which, really, was more of a big cabin-I was surprised it was still standing. We stepped onto the porch, and Freddy took his sweet, sweet time rummaging for his keys. Then he spent a full thirty seconds trying to remember which key actually opened his door.

He was an old man, so I didn't really mind... But time was running short. This better has to be worth it.

As we finally arrived at Freddy's house-which, really, was more of a big cabin-I was surprised it was still standing. We stepped onto the porch, and Freddy took his sweet, sweet time rummaging for his keys. Then he spent a full thirty seconds trying to remember which key actually opened his door.

He was an old man, so I didn't really mind... But time was running short. This better be worth it.

When Freddy finally found the right key, he slid it into the lock and opened the door, letting us inside. I didn't even notice him locking it behind us once we were both in.

His house was, well... exactly what you'd expect from an old man like him. Worn wooden furniture creaked with age, some of it looking like it might collapse if you sneezed too hard. There were dozens of photos-snapshots of Freddy from his younger days, scattered across shelves and walls.

Right next to me sat a small table, with a single framed photo resting gently on top. It showed a young man and a beautiful young woman, smiling like the world had just opened up for them. I figured it was Freddy and his wife, back when life was still full of happines that no longer exists.

Freddy gave a fake cough, and I quickly apologized, placing the photo back where I found it. He just smiled faintly and said, ""It's okay, kid. Everybody likes to look back at the better parts of ourselves sometimes... don't you think?""

Michael, however, was slowly wandering around like a kid in a museum. I don't think any of us had ever actually been inside Freddy's house before-he never invited anyone over. Back then, it didn't really feel strange. After his wife passed away, I just figured he needed space for himself.

""You've got quite the archive here,"" Michael said, eyeing the wall covered in photos.

""Indeed,"" Freddy replied. ""Our memories stay in our minds forever, but it's nice to have a reminder of the better days... when you walk out of your room in the morning and see this."" He chuckled dryly. ""Or even if you're just walking out of the toilet.""

His laugh was cut short by a soft cough, his hand still resting on his cane. I stepped closer, concerned, but Freddy raised his hand to stop me.

He looked up, nodded slowly, and said with a weak smile, ""Yeah... it's fine. I'm fine.""

""You sure, old man?"" Michael asked, slightly worried.

Freddy let out a dry laugh, coughing once through it. ""For God's sake, Michael,"" he grumbled, leaning a little harder on his cane. ""You think I'm that old?""

Michael raised an eyebrow. ""No offense,"" he said with a smirk, ""but yes.""

""Clever boy,"" Freddy muttered, coughing a little more as he started heading toward the kitchen. ""Make yourselves at home, boys. You want tea? Coffee?""

I told Freddy that this could wait and it would be better if he just told us everything he knew. But he insisted, saying we could talk once our necks weren't dry.

Michael shouted that he'd like some coffee. I shrugged and said I'd take one too.

As I settled in, I glanced at the clock-and my brow furrowed. It showed 15:00. But when we'd left my house, it was only around 14:00.

I figured Freddy's clocks must be an hour fast and let it go.

I set my shotgun down beside me and waited as Freddy made the coffee. He returned after about three minutes, carrying it on a small tray with cups. His hand trembled slightly as he carefully placed the tray on the table.

""Careful... it's hot,"" he said with a soft smile.

Then he eased himself into an old chair, the wood creaking under his weight, and picked up his cup with quiet intention.

Michael raised his voice slightly. ""Do you have Alzheimer's or something? We mean-what did you see last night? And how the hell did you know we saw something too?"" thats the whole reason you invited us over.

""Ah... this,"" Freddy said, sipping slightly from his cup before looking at us. ""I'm sorry. Sometimes my mind forgets even the most important things-especially the day my wife died. My beautiful Mary... still full of life, still full of beauty."" He sighed. ""And then cancer had to take her from me.

You know, we used to always sit like this, sipping hot coffee right here like-""

He was suddenly cut off by Michael, who was getting visibly impatient.

""Freddy,"" he said firmly.

""Yes..."" he said slowly. ""The things I've seen, yeah...""

He took a shallow breath, then looked at us both.

""But tell me, boys-what exactly did you see?""

We both looked at each other... He knew we'd seen something, yet never bothered explaining how.

Still, we began recounting everything that had happened to us. And to our surprise, Freddy didn't look intimidated-not even a little scared. It was as if he heard things like this every single Friday.

But there was one detail I'd missed at first: Freddy kept glancing at the clock. Not just once or twice-he looked at it almost every minute. It was subtle, just a flicker of his eyes each time... but constant.

Michael had probably noticed it too-but he didn't say anything. Once we finished telling our stories, he just sat there. No reaction. Not a single flinch. It was like he'd just listened to a boring political debate or something.

Then, he nodded slightly, eyes lowered. And finally, he spoke.

""You see...""

""She was warning us about them,"" Freddy said quietly.

""What do you mean, them?"" Michael asked.

""The Nonames,"" Freddy replied. ""They're just called Them.""

""They don't have names. They don't have human feelings. And they were here long before any of us- and they'll still be here long after we're all gone.""

Michael and I looked at each other, stunned. How did he know all of this? And why hadn't he said anything sooner?

I asked him directly, ""How do you know all this? And why didn't you tell us earlier?""

Freddy stayed silent for a long moment. Then he finally spoke.

""How's the coffee? You better finish it before it gets cold. 

""You didn't answer the question,"" Michael said, now clearly impatient and suspicious.

Freddy's smile faded. He stood up slowly, leaning on his cane, and walked toward me. He stopped just a few inches away, eyes dim but steady.

""I offered you answers. Hospitality. And you don't even value it..."" he said, his voice faintly wounded.

I glanced at the coffee. Why had he been so insistent we drink it? And then it hit me-maybe it was poisoned.

But I kept my face neutral, forcing a calm breath. An idea began to form in my mind.

""Hey... uh, didn't you hear knocking on the door?"" I said, loud enough to break the silence and shift the mood.

Freddy raised an eyebrow and glanced slightly toward the door. And as if Michael shared the same thought as me, he nodded and said, ""Yeah, I think I heard something too. You should check-see who it is.""

Freddy's expression turned unreadable, and that scared me more than I expected. But after a moment, he simply said, ""Go on... see who it is.""

I nodded and carefully took a sip of the coffee- but didn't swallow.

Then I walked toward the door, quickly spotting a vase with a plant. I leaned over and discreetly spat the coffee into it.

Turning back to the door, I grabbed the handle and tried to open it- but it was locked.

""Fuck..."" I whispered, tugging again. Nothing.

I was so focused on getting out that I hadn't realized something far more unsettling: The sun outside was already setting.

My eyes widened in shock. That... that wasn't possible. Only like an hour should've passed since we arrived.

I spun toward the hallway clock, heart pounding. The minute hand ticked forward, merciless and clear.

19:55. 

I rushed back into the living room- and froze at what I saw.

Both Freddy and Michael were standing. Michael had one hand raised slightly, backed into a corner, his face pale with fear.

Freddy stood without his cane-holding my shotgun. He was pointing it directly at Michael.

Michael noticed me, eyes wide with alarm. Freddy saw me too, and without hesitation, barked in a tone I'd never heard from him before:

""Go to that other corner. Slowly. Or I'll blow his fucking head off.""

For a moment, I stood frozen. Paralyzed.

Then Freddy's voice erupted through the room, sharp and thunderous.

""Didn't you fucking hear me?! Move!!""

I nodded quickly. ""Alright, alright-take it easy. None of this is necessary, Freddy,"" I said, my voice shaky with fear, though I held onto a sliver of hope that I could change his mind.

Slowly, I made my way to the other corner of the living room, hands slightly raised. ""Freddy... y-you don't have to do this,"" I said, my tone trembling.

""It is necessary. I'm sorry,"" Freddy said, his voice low but resolute. ""Just don't make any sudden moves, and everything will be fine.""

Michael, still backed against the wall, shouted with disbelief, ""What got into you, Freddy? What's wrong with you?""

Freddy looked down, avoiding our gaze for a moment before slowly raising his eyes back to meet ours.

""I have to do this..."" he said quietly. ""They promised me.""

Freddy nodded slowly, the barrel of the shotgun dipping ever so slightly as the weight of his confession sank in.

""They said they could bring her back..."" he whispered. ""My Mary. Not in memory. Not in dreams. But real.""

Michael's voice trembled. ""Y-you mean... Them?""

""They said... they'll let me see her again,"" Freddy murmured. ""If I... if I do this.""

""Do what?"" I asked, voice low and tight.

But Freddy didn't answer. He just stared past me-expression unreadable.

That's when it hit me. The broken phones. The cars that wouldn't start.

The silence outside.

My breath caught.

""That was you... wasn't it?""

Then I looked at the clock. 20:00.

My eyes widened in terror. I turned back to Freddy.

""Freddy... what have you done?""

Freddy's gaze didn't flinch.

""It's too late, child,"" he said, voice hollow. ""They're already coming. And there's nothing we can do.""

That was the moment it all clicked. I still can't explain how the time slipped away so fast-how sunset came without warning. But the pieces fit.

The broken phones. The cars that wouldn't start.

Freddy. He'd sabotaged everything.

They had promised him a reunion with his beloved Mary. And the price?

Us.

He'd trapped us here. And now... it was too late.

And they... were coming for us.

1m42578,https://i.redd.it/rv7gz0vmavdf1.jpeg,"Jacking It, and by It I mean In Cider","Made Applejack from cider I laid down 3 years ago from local SW Washington fruit. Its destination is a Jack Rose cocktail (included below)

These days, Applejack is basically Apple Brandy distilled from cider (Lairds Bottled in Bond is the best), but it started back in the olden times being ‚Äújacked‚Äù from cider by leaving the barrels outside in the winter and skimming off the ice. Each freeze would remove water and leave behind alcohol and tailings.

Over the past month, I used the same mug I use for making clear ice to deep freeze, top down, an 8-pack of leftover apple-marionberry cider (thus the color). Each day, I took the frozen slush, dumped it into a shaker, and strained it using a Hawthorne strainer with a tight coil. It took about 4 days per 16 oz to get it down to where it would no longer freeze, about 2 oz remaining each time. A final trip through a coffee strainer removed remaining sediment from the collected product.

That process resulted in 375ml of rocket fuel you see here. A a final test, I tried freezing it one last time. As every child that tried to replace a tipple with water in their parents‚Äô freezer vodka has learned, high enough ABV stops freezing. This one didn‚Äôt even have ice crystals after 48 hours. Tastes like a strong liqueur. Hoping I got it above 35%. Have some leftover cider of your own? Give it a shot.

The destination cocktail is a grenadine-lemon-applejack combo, the *Jack Rose*. Toast the pilgrims as you tip one back!

1. 1 1/2 oz Applejack (Lairds Bottled in Bond or homemade, adjust up or down based on ABV)

2. 1/2 oz Homemade Grenadine (Morgenthaler recipe)

3. 3/4 oz Fresh squeezed lemon juice

1m424id,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1m424id/theyre_still_out_there_chapter_3/,They're still out there.... chapter 3,"After that strange situation-which I still can't explain-people began heading to their homes, while Valeria and the others took their bikes along with some other supplies I assume were water, food, and perhaps flashlights.

Some folks, however, stayed outside-perhaps searching for those who went missing. I didnt had much faith that they'll be found. I don't want to sound like a heartless bastard, but if everything that happened to me also happened to them, then...

I uh i think I heard footsteps inside the house just in first floor. I had to stop writing and stay silent. I don't know if it was paranoia or if my mind was playing tricks on me. It could be them... but the light hasn't fully faded yet, so there's no chance they'd be able to get inside during the sunlight.

I don't hear anything anymore-for now. Michael and I headed toward my house. I asked if he could stay the night, and he didn't object; he'd had a similar idea anyway. I guess neither of us wanted to be alone tonight after everything that happened. I just had to make sure he didn't go upstairs and see the dried blood for now. As for the shotgun, I'd explain that I had it taken out... just in case. Along the way, Michael tried to lift the mood with his usual jokes-like ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" or some dark humor he'd always pull out when tension filled the air. But this time, I only managed a fake smile or forced laugh. Even though I used to at least chuckle at them... now, I just couldn't.

As much as I tried to think of something else, my mind kept slipping back to the memories of last night. ""As we arrived home, I let Michael go first. Once we were both inside, I closed the door, and as it shut, Michael turned to me and spoke.""

""Alright, Jackie, we've known each other for a few years now-and I can already tell something's wrong. It's not just this situation, or you claiming you didn't sleep well. Something bad happened to you, man... What is it?"" Michael asked..

I probably should've figured he'd eventually see through my camouflage.'I thought to myself'.

""Ugh, Michael, it's not anything serious, I just......"" I stopped. I probably already knew he wouldn't believe a word if I said something like, ""It's nothing. This whole situation is just messed up,"" or, ""I just had some nightmares.""

""Do you promise you won't see me as someone who escaped from an asylum if I tell you?""

Michael nodded with his arms crossed. ""I think I can handle whatever you throw at me. Go on, I'm listening."" He probably wanted to add a cheeky remark, but stopped himself near the end of the sentence.

I took a deep breath and motioned for him to follow me upstairs. As we walked upstairs, I began explaining what had happened last night. When I mentioned the disappearance of the police officers, his face turned confused. Honestly, I'd probably look just as bewildered if someone told me the cops who'd visited me had suddenly vanished into the void.

Michael....So you're telling me that you saw the police officers who were supposed to show up yesterday-but never did-right in front of your house, and then they just vanished... like my money after payday?"" he said with a hint of dry humor, only to realize this indeed probably wasn't the best time for jokes.

I didn't react to his joke, and I think he probably realized it wasn't the right time for it. His expression shifted instantly when we arrived to my bedroom, i letted the door open so he dosent see that scarch marks... and revealed the dried pool of blood on the floor.

He stood there frozen, staring at the dried blood-probably with no idea what to say.

""Fucking hell..."" That's all he managed to say, his voice trembling with disbelief and unease. To be honest, that was the first time I'd seen him like that-stunned, speechless, and completely at a loss for what to even think.

""J-Jackie... is this...?""he mumbled

""Yeah,"" I nodded slowly. ""It's blood,"" I said with a sigh.

He turned slowly toward me, eyes scanning my face-probably trying to figure out if the blood was mine, if I was hurt or anything. ""Is it yours, Jackie? Are you hurt?"" he asked, now slightly worried.

""No, it's not mine. Don't worry,"" I said quickly. ""It's... uhm..."" I trailed off, struggling to find the right words.

""Michael..."" I said, not really prepared to tell the truth. ""There was something in my house last night... not just police officers outside, but something else too."" Michael's face shifted into unease at my words. I imagined anyone would react the same way-hearing that their friend or family member had someone, or something, inside their house.

""What do you mean, something?"" Michael asked, dread clearly creeping over him with every passing second.

My eyes shut, damp with the weight of what I was about to say. ""I... I think it was Amanda, Michael,"" I whispered, opening them slowly. I didn't know what to expect from him when I said Amanda's name. Given the blood and my shaky nerves, I wouldn't blame him for thinking I'd done something to her... maybe even something worse.

Michael froze, his mouth hanging open. ""Amanda... you mean..."" He paused, swallowing hard, searching for the right words. ""The Amanda who vanished? The one the entire village was out looking for? She was here?""

I nodded slowly, dread curling in my chest. ""Y-yes... but it wasn't Amanda anymore, Michael. She was... something else."" I sucked in a sharp breath. No more holding back. If he thought I was insane or delusional, fine. I had to say it. I needed to say it.

""Yes, it was Amanda. I know it was her."" My voice trembled. ""She broke into my house, and I thought she was trying to hurt me. God, Michael... she was running on all fours. Her pupils were gone, her tongue was fucking gone, and her limbs were twisted-unnaturally twisted.""

I swallowed hard, the memory clawing at me. ""I hid in my room with a shotgun and locked the door, but she got in. And I...""

My voice cracked. I could feel the tears threatening. ""I think I almost started crying... and I shot her.""

""I... I shot her.""

I stepped back, collapsed onto my bed, broken. ""I was just so scared, Michael. I didn't know what to do."" I was just so fucking scared..

In a situation like this, most people would think I'd just had too much to drink, or maybe a horrific, twisted nightmare. Some might even assume I'd taken something. They wouldn't believe a word of it.

But not Michael. Not him.

He looked at the pool of blood one last time, then sighed quietly. Without saying anything, he walked over and sat beside me.

I didn't dare look him in the face.

He just sat there, staring down at the floor, silent.He folded his arms across his chest, silent for a moment longer. Then, without looking at me, he said the last thing I ever thought I'd hear.

""I believe you.""

At those words, my eyes widened in disbelief. I couldn't believe it. After everything I'd told him-everything that would sound like pure nonsense to anyone else-he actually believed me.

""You're serious? You actually believe everything I just told you?"" I looked at him, my expression full of disbelief.

""Well... yeah, I do. I believe you,"" he said, voice low. ""Because I know you'd never lie about something like this. And honestly, considering everything that just happend... it makes it even more believable.""

He hesitated. ""I... I didn't know if I was going crazy, but last night... I think something was in my house too.""

At that moment, I saw him shiver. A flicker of fear passed through him. ""

""Last night, after the whole fiasco surrounding Amanda's disappearance, I had to calm my mind with a bottle of beer. For the next few hours, everything seemed fine-just like any other day, you know? But around 8:00 p.m., I heard some sounds coming from the second floor. At first, I didn't react; I just kept listening, trying to figure out if what I'd heard was real. Still, I was slightly on edge. I thought maybe it was just... I don't know, my imagination. Then, another sound came-but this time, I recognized it: footsteps. Slow, but heavy, coming from the second floor.

""I froze, still sitting on the couch. I hadn't turned around-at least not yet. I just... I was paralyzed by that simple sound. Then came more: heavy footsteps, less human and more like those of a large animal. But they didn't head downstairs where I was. I think I heard doors being opened... and closed. Like... like it was searching for someone-or something.""

""I kept listening to Michael's story, and my heart was beating faster with every word. He genuinely sounded terrified. And honestly, I couldn't blame him. The more I think about it, the more I realize-he was probably lucky to have survived in one piece.""

""He said that, despite the fear, he slowly stood up. Carefully-quietly-he placed the bottle onto the couch, trying to keep the sound to a minimum. At that moment, soaking the cushions was the least of his worries. But instead of heading upstairs to investigate, he moved slowly toward the kitchen, his intentions unmistakable. Even though it wasn't far, the short walk felt like miles. Every step was deliberate, every sound magnified, as he tried to stay as silent as possible.""

""Luckily, he reached the kitchen without making a sound. Carefully, he opened a drawer and took out the biggest knife he could find. But as he pulled it free, the blade scraped across another, producing a faint clink. Michael clenched his teeth and shut his eyes for a moment. Luckily... he heard nothing in response. That's when he realized-he wasn't hearing anything at all. No more footsteps. No more doors opening. Just silence.""

""That confused me,"" Michael said. He had alcohol in his system, sure, but he swore he really heard those footsteps upstairs. He thought about calling the police-but what if he was just drunk and nothing was actually up there? How would he even explain it to them? I doubted the phone would work anyway.""

""He decided to check it out, just to be sure. His sweaty palms gripped the knife firmly as he crept toward the stairs, trying to make as little noise as possible. But the higher he climbed, the more the lights began to flicker. At first, it confused him-just a brief glitch, maybe? But with every step closer to the second floor, the flickering grew more intense. By the time he reached the top, the lights stuttered so violently it was nearly impossible to see.""

""As he finally stepped onto the second floor, the flickering stopped. The hallway looked... normal-well-lit, quiet, and untouched. No sign of an intruder. But Michael felt it. Something was off. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but the air felt heavier. He quickened his pace, gripping the knife tightly, and began opening doors one by one. First, the bathroom: cloaked in darkness but empty. Then, his bedroom: again, nothing. Finally, he approached the guest room-the one he rarely used.""

""He opened the door, tightened his grip on the knife, and flicked on the light. The guest room looked just as he'd left it-cozy, untouched. He stepped inside and started scanning the space. That's when he noticed the window. It was open. He was certain he hadn't left it that way. A slight frown formed as he cautiously approached. Peering outside, he saw... nothing. Just darkness and stillness.""

""After that, Michael fell silent. He looked up slightly, then glanced around the room like he was afraid something-or someone-might overhear. His eyes darted across the walls before finally turning to me. And then, in a voice edged with unease, he said: 'Jackie... when I turned around, I... I saw something. Something I can't... explain.'""

""Was it Amanda?"" I asked, thinking that he'd seen the same thing I had.

""Michael slowly shook his head and said... no.""

""I saw... I saw something else..."" At those words, my eyes widened slightly in fear. ""W... what did you see?""

""Michael said that when he closed the window and looked back, the hallway was shrouded in darkness. But that wasn't the worst part... The worst part was that, when he looked a little closer, he saw something in it.""

""He couldn't see it clearly, but he knew-there was a figure standing in the hallway, right in front of his door. But... something was off. Something strange, something that-even now-fills my body with terror, knowing that it's still out there... somewhere. And I know that the thing... whatever it was... it had also been in my garden that night.""

""The strange thing was that, unlike the way Amanda looked, this figure-according to his description-was on a completely different level of horror. He said it was tall... really tall. So tall, in fact, he couldn't even see its head through the doorway, only part of its neck. He admitted he might've been glad he hadn't seen its face. Still, it didn't move. It just stood there. It looked disturbingly thin, which made the heavy footsteps even more unsettling. Possibly the worst part was its limbs: unnaturally skinny, and far too long for a human. He swore its hands could probably touch the floor even while standing upright. He couldn't tell if it could see him. It was staring directly at the wall above the door-or... maybe it was doing something else entirely.""

In fear, he stepped back slightly, his hands trembling-until the floor beneath him creaked. He froze, eyes wide. If that thing hadn't been aware of him before... it definitely was now. Despite the light still being on in the room, it did nothing to ease the unease. Then, slowly, it began to lean down so it can fit to door. One of its hands gripped the edge of the doorframe, and in the light, he could see it clearly-long, dirty, broken nails... and skin. Skin as black as ash, torn in places, revealing ragged patches of raw flesh.

""His heart was pounding so wildly, he thought it might give out. He even said he nearly forgot to breathe."" 

But before the creature could reveal itself in full, it froze mid-lean. That's when he heard it-a new sound. Scratching. The soft, unmistakable sound of claws or nails scraping against something-coming from the lower floor. And the way the creature stopped... it seemed like it heard it too.

'Scratching?' I asked, and Michael nodded, his expression grim and distant. He said the creature had paused-Its long, disfigured fingers, tipped with jagged, earth-stained nails, digged into the wall. The sound was faint but unmistakable: a slow, deliberate scrape, like bone dragged across plaster. The creature seemed to savor the moment, its hand lingering before withdrawing. Then it straightened, limbs impossibly thin but unnaturally fluid.

Despite its skeletal frame, it moved with shocking force-charging toward the sound below with a burst of speed that made Michael stagger. The scratching ceased instantly. Heavy, thunderous footsteps shook the air. Michael froze, listening as the sound transformed-overlapped-smaller, lighter steps now trailing behind. 

Then the back door exploded open, 

And then-complete silence.

""He said that after that, he quickly ran to the door, slammed it shut, locked it, and stayed there the entire night with the knife in his hand. He barely slept. By morning, the memories were still lingering... though he wasn't sure if any of it had really happened.""

""Once he gathered the courage to head downstairs, the house felt unusually cold. Later, he realized why-the door leading to the garden had been left open. But that wasn't the strangest part. He noticed marks on the wall-marks that looked like scratches made by nails. Only... they weren't just random scratches, he said. They formed a word. A word carved into the surface by something unnatural. It said...""

Leave...i finsihed his sentance.

Michael looked at me, surprised. ""Yes... h-how do you know that?"" he asked.

I gestured for him to follow me and led him toward the door. Once we reached it, I closed it-to reveal the same markings. Michael froze. Before he could say a word, I spoke. ""Michael... I think whatever was in your house was also in my garden. And the scratching... it was Amanda. I think she was trying to warn us... about- it.""

Michael stared at the markings, then looked at me. ""You mean... those same markings in my house-they were made by it? And she... she was trying to warn us?""*

""I'm not completely sure... but it's the only explanation I have. I think the thing inside your house was searching for her-and you were just in its way. But Amanda... she caught its attention. And she left us that message.""

""We have to warn the others,"" I said. But Michael looked skeptical. ""And what exactly should we tell them? That Amanda-who turned into a monster-returned in the middle of the night to warn us about something else out there? I believe it... I really do. But I don't think they'd ever believe us.""

""Even now, I'm not sure if other people would actually believe us-or if they just saw us as crazy. But back then, I thought they might at least consider everything: the dead cars, the broken phones... the missing people.

""We have to at least try, Michael. We might all be in danger-as crazy as it sounds. What are we supposed to do? Just sit on our asses and act like nothing happened?""

Michael shook his head. ""Of course not... but what if they think we're somehow connected to Amanda's disappearance?""

I think he had a point back then. I just had this strange feeling-like something bad was going to happen... And I was right.

Michael placed a hand over his forehead, thinking hard, before finally speaking.

""Well... at least we can try asking if something similar has happened to them. If they've experienced anything like this, then maybe-maybe-it's safe to tell them at least half the truth.""**

""That sounded fair enough. It felt like the more logical choice-rather than running around telling everyone there's a monster stalking houses and hunting for Amanda.""

It was settled then. We headed downstairs, about to leave the house. As I passed the clock, I glanced at it-14:00. But just as Michael opened the front door, he stumbled back in fright. A man was standing right outside. It was Freddy. holding his crooked staff-the same man who had claimed he saw a figure outside Amanda's house the night she disappeared.

Michael clutched his chest and took a deep breath. ""Fucking hell, Freddy-you scared the shit out of me, man.""

**Freddy apologized for the scare-and for showing up unannounced. I stepped closer, eyeing him suspiciously. Could this be another trick? But nothing strange ever seemed to happen during the daytime...

Then he hit us with these words. Something we didn't expect.

""You two have seen something too, haven't you?""**

It completely caught us off guard. We looked at each other, unsure what to say-also wondering how the hell Freddy could've known. I answered cautiously, suspicion lacing my voice. ""H... how do you know that?""

Michael crossed his arms slowly, his eyes narrowing just enough to show he was just as on edge.

""You're not the only ones seeing things, young lads,"" Freddy said. ""For the past few hours, I've seen things I can't quite explain...""

So it was true. This nightmare wasn't just ours.

Michael, however, answered quicker than I did. ""So you've seen weird things too, huh? Well, welcome to the band.""

There was a flicker of dry humor in his voice-an instinctive shield against the tension clawing at all of us. But his expression betrayed no smile. He was serious. Leaning slightly forward, eyes locked onto Freddy's, he continued with low urgency.

""Listen-we think something bad might be coming. Something bigger than all this weirdness. The dead phones, the missing people, even Amanda's disappearance-they aren't just coincidences. There's a pattern forming, and it's not random.""

Freddy's grip on his staff tightened, his knuckles whitening ever so slightly.

He glanced around, scanning the empty street to make sure we were alone. Then he said it-low and serious. ""Follow me.""

I hesitated. ""Why?"" I asked.

Freddy didn't blink.

""I might know something.""

Michael and I exchanged a look. That quiet, wordless kind that spoke volumes. We both nodded.

""Alright,"" I said, stepping back toward the hallway. ""But hold up-let me grab my shotgun.""

Freddy stopped me, raising his voice just enough to catch my attention. ""I don't think that's necessary, my boy,"" he said.

But I didn't stop walking.

""I insist,"" I called over my shoulder. ""It might come in handy.""

Freddy sighed, his grip tightening slightly on his staff.

""Alright,"" he muttered. ""But be quick about it.

I quickly headed to the living room where my shotgun was still lying on the couch. I grabbed it, and before going back, I opened the drawer where I kept the rest of my ammo. There were only four rounds-I never thought I'd need more. I snatched them up, quickly reloaded, and returned to Michael and Freddy after two minutes.

""Finally,"" Freddy said. ""Thought I spent the rest of my pension here.""

Michael looked at me holding the shotgun and gave a firm nod. Freddy grunted, ""Alright, let's not waste any time, follow me.

I closed the door, and with that, the three of us headed toward Freddy's house. The streets, however, were completely empty-not a single soul in sight, and no sounds except the echo of our footsteps. A strange chill hung in the air. It felt like we'd stepped into a ghost town.

Freddy's house was only three minutes away, a short walk that once felt like a stroll through the heart of a living neighborhood. The streets had always been full of life-children darting between parked cars,laughing; neighbors huddled near fences, swapping stories and gossip; someone perched on a worn wooden bench, sipping coffee and soaking in the warmth of the day.

But now, that familiar vibrancy had evaporated. No voices. No movement. The air itself seemed hollow.

Even as I write this, it makes me miss those old times- times of normal life, when the streets were full of joy, and not... well, not this.

I'd give anything to have those days back. But its gone now.

As we finally arrived at Freddy's house-which, really, was more of a big cabin-I was surprised it was still standing. We stepped onto the porch, and Freddy took his sweet, sweet time rummaging for his keys. Then he spent a full thirty seconds trying to remember which key actually opened his door.

He was an old man, so I didn't really mind... But time was running short. This better has to be worth it.

As we finally arrived at Freddy's house-which, really, was more of a big cabin-I was surprised it was still standing. We stepped onto the porch, and Freddy took his sweet, sweet time rummaging for his keys. Then he spent a full thirty seconds trying to remember which key actually opened his door.

He was an old man, so I didn't really mind... But time was running short. This better be worth it.

When Freddy finally found the right key, he slid it into the lock and opened the door, letting us inside. I didn't even notice him locking it behind us once we were both in.

His house was, well... exactly what you'd expect from an old man like him. Worn wooden furniture creaked with age, some of it looking like it might collapse if you sneezed too hard. There were dozens of photos-snapshots of Freddy from his younger days, scattered across shelves and walls.

Right next to me sat a small table, with a single framed photo resting gently on top. It showed a young man and a beautiful young woman, smiling like the world had just opened up for them. I figured it was Freddy and his wife, back when life was still full of happines that no longer exists.

Freddy gave a fake cough, and I quickly apologized, placing the photo back where I found it. He just smiled faintly and said, ""It's okay, kid. Everybody likes to look back at the better parts of ourselves sometimes... don't you think?""

Michael, however, was slowly wandering around like a kid in a museum. I don't think any of us had ever actually been inside Freddy's house before-he never invited anyone over. Back then, it didn't really feel strange. After his wife passed away, I just figured he needed space for himself.

""You've got quite the archive here,"" Michael said, eyeing the wall covered in photos.

""Indeed,"" Freddy replied. ""Our memories stay in our minds forever, but it's nice to have a reminder of the better days... when you walk out of your room in the morning and see this."" He chuckled dryly. ""Or even if you're just walking out of the toilet.""

His laugh was cut short by a soft cough, his hand still resting on his cane. I stepped closer, concerned, but Freddy raised his hand to stop me.

He looked up, nodded slowly, and said with a weak smile, ""Yeah... it's fine. I'm fine.""

""You sure, old man?"" Michael asked, slightly worried.

Freddy let out a dry laugh, coughing once through it. ""For God's sake, Michael,"" he grumbled, leaning a little harder on his cane. ""You think I'm that old?""

Michael raised an eyebrow. ""No offense,"" he said with a smirk, ""but yes.""

""Clever boy,"" Freddy muttered, coughing a little more as he started heading toward the kitchen. ""Make yourselves at home, boys. You want tea? Coffee?""

I told Freddy that this could wait and it would be better if he just told us everything he knew. But he insisted, saying we could talk once our necks weren't dry.

Michael shouted that he'd like some coffee. I shrugged and said I'd take one too.

As I settled in, I glanced at the clock-and my brow furrowed. It showed 15:00. But when we'd left my house, it was only around 14:00.

I figured Freddy's clocks must be an hour fast and let it go.

I set my shotgun down beside me and waited as Freddy made the coffee. He returned after about three minutes, carrying it on a small tray with cups. His hand trembled slightly as he carefully placed the tray on the table.

""Careful... it's hot,"" he said with a soft smile.

Then he eased himself into an old chair, the wood creaking under his weight, and picked up his cup with quiet intention.

Michael raised his voice slightly. ""Do you have Alzheimer's or something? We mean-what did you see last night? And how the hell did you know we saw something too?"" thats the whole reason you invited us over.

""Ah... this,"" Freddy said, sipping slightly from his cup before looking at us. ""I'm sorry. Sometimes my mind forgets even the most important things-especially the day my wife died. My beautiful Mary... still full of life, still full of beauty."" He sighed. ""And then cancer had to take her from me.

You know, we used to always sit like this, sipping hot coffee right here like-""

He was suddenly cut off by Michael, who was getting visibly impatient.

""Freddy,"" he said firmly.

""Yes..."" he said slowly. ""The things I've seen, yeah...""

He took a shallow breath, then looked at us both.

""But tell me, boys-what exactly did you see?""

We both looked at each other... He knew we'd seen something, yet never bothered explaining how.

Still, we began recounting everything that had happened to us. And to our surprise, Freddy didn't look intimidated-not even a little scared. It was as if he heard things like this every single Friday.

But there was one detail I'd missed at first: Freddy kept glancing at the clock. Not just once or twice-he looked at it almost every minute. It was subtle, just a flicker of his eyes each time... but constant.

Michael had probably noticed it too-but he didn't say anything. Once we finished telling our stories, he just sat there. No reaction. Not a single flinch. It was like he'd just listened to a boring political debate or something.

Then, he nodded slightly, eyes lowered. And finally, he spoke.

""You see...""

""She was warning us about them,"" Freddy said quietly.

""What do you mean, them?"" Michael asked.

""The Nonames,"" Freddy replied. ""They're just called Them.""

""They don't have names. They don't have human feelings. And they were here long before any of us- and they'll still be here long after we're all gone.""

Michael and I looked at each other, stunned. How did he know all of this? And why hadn't he said anything sooner?

I asked him directly, ""How do you know all this? And why didn't you tell us earlier?""

Freddy stayed silent for a long moment. Then he finally spoke.

""How's the coffee? You better finish it before it gets cold. 

""You didn't answer the question,"" Michael said, now clearly impatient and suspicious.

Freddy's smile faded. He stood up slowly, leaning on his cane, and walked toward me. He stopped just a few inches away, eyes dim but steady.

""I offered you answers. Hospitality. And you don't even value it..."" he said, his voice faintly wounded.

I glanced at the coffee. Why had he been so insistent we drink it? And then it hit me-maybe it was poisoned.

But I kept my face neutral, forcing a calm breath. An idea began to form in my mind.

""Hey... uh, didn't you hear knocking on the door?"" I said, loud enough to break the silence and shift the mood.

Freddy raised an eyebrow and glanced slightly toward the door. And as if Michael shared the same thought as me, he nodded and said, ""Yeah, I think I heard something too. You should check-see who it is.""

Freddy's expression turned unreadable, and that scared me more than I expected. But after a moment, he simply said, ""Go on... see who it is.""

I nodded and carefully took a sip of the coffee- but didn't swallow.

Then I walked toward the door, quickly spotting a vase with a plant. I leaned over and discreetly spat the coffee into it.

Turning back to the door, I grabbed the handle and tried to open it- but it was locked.

""Fuck..."" I whispered, tugging again. Nothing.

I was so focused on getting out that I hadn't realized something far more unsettling: The sun outside was already setting.

My eyes widened in shock. That... that wasn't possible. Only like an hour should've passed since we arrived.

I spun toward the hallway clock, heart pounding. The minute hand ticked forward, merciless and clear.

19:55. 

I rushed back into the living room- and froze at what I saw.

Both Freddy and Michael were standing. Michael had one hand raised slightly, backed into a corner, his face pale with fear.

Freddy stood without his cane-holding my shotgun. He was pointing it directly at Michael.

Michael noticed me, eyes wide with alarm. Freddy saw me too, and without hesitation, barked in a tone I'd never heard from him before:

""Go to that other corner. Slowly. Or I'll blow his fucking head off.""

For a moment, I stood frozen. Paralyzed.

Then Freddy's voice erupted through the room, sharp and thunderous.

""Didn't you fucking hear me?! Move!!""

I nodded quickly. ""Alright, alright-take it easy. None of this is necessary, Freddy,"" I said, my voice shaky with fear, though I held onto a sliver of hope that I could change his mind.

Slowly, I made my way to the other corner of the living room, hands slightly raised. ""Freddy... y-you don't have to do this,"" I said, my tone trembling.

""It is necessary. I'm sorry,"" Freddy said, his voice low but resolute. ""Just don't make any sudden moves, and everything will be fine.""

Michael, still backed against the wall, shouted with disbelief, ""What got into you, Freddy? What's wrong with you?""

Freddy looked down, avoiding our gaze for a moment before slowly raising his eyes back to meet ours.

""I have to do this..."" he said quietly. ""They promised me.""

Freddy nodded slowly, the barrel of the shotgun dipping ever so slightly as the weight of his confession sank in.

""They said they could bring her back..."" he whispered. ""My Mary. Not in memory. Not in dreams. But real.""

Michael's voice trembled. ""Y-you mean... Them?""

""They said... they'll let me see her again,"" Freddy murmured. ""If I... if I do this.""

""Do what?"" I asked, voice low and tight.

But Freddy didn't answer. He just stared past me-expression unreadable.

That's when it hit me. The broken phones. The cars that wouldn't start.

The silence outside.

My breath caught.

""That was you... wasn't it?""

Then I looked at the clock. 20:00.

My eyes widened in terror. I turned back to Freddy.

""Freddy... what have you done?""

Freddy's gaze didn't flinch.

""It's too late, child,"" he said, voice hollow. ""They're already coming. And there's nothing we can do.""

That was the moment it all clicked. I still can't explain how the time slipped away so fast-how sunset came without warning. But the pieces fit.

The broken phones. The cars that wouldn't start.

Freddy. He'd sabotaged everything.

They had promised him a reunion with his beloved Mary. And the price?

Us.

He'd trapped us here. And now... it was too late.

And they... were coming for us.

1m420kg,https://v.redd.it/wm466zfa9vdf1,Against Stupidity By: Valentino Grimes,"(the video-clip is just for jokes!)  
  
**Good Morning My Beloved Congregation!**

Today, I woke up, and The Muse chose violence...  
I'm still working my way through ""letters and Papers From Prison"" from¬†Dietrich Bonhoeffer. but this morning with my coffee and smoke, I read the ""The Theory Of Stupidity"":  
  
([https://www.onthewing.org/user/Bonhoeffer%20-%20Theory%20of%20Stupidity.pdf]())  
  
The Muse and I decided¬†to weaponize these works, and aim them at religion and academia... I‚Äôm about to set your brain on fire and watch that sacred cow of religion sizzle, and serve the congregation up some steaks!  
  
Stupidity isn‚Äôt some cute little flaw, it‚Äôs a poisoned dagger plunged into The Temple of Reason by the self‚Äëappointed high priests of Abrahamic faiths. Despite being a devout christian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer knew what was up: once you hand your mind over to dogma, you turn into a drooling drone, chanting hollow mantras while the real world burns around you.

Judaism and Christianity strut around like they own morality, stealing once Greek scriptures and spewing them out into Hebrew & Latin incantations so that no one can question their holy fairy tales. Biblical scholars? They‚Äôre the court jesters of this diabolical circus, juggling footnotes to distract you from the fact that their translations are as reliable as a politician‚Äôs promise. Try bringing up that rogue papyrus that contradicts their entire narrative, and they‚Äôll label you ‚Äúapocryphal‚Äù faster than you can say ‚ÄúYou're a coward.""

But here‚Äôs the twist: the real heroes are the philologists: the mad linguist scientists who dive headfirst into rotting scrolls, flip off centuries of editorial bullshit, and reveal that these ‚Äúdivine‚Äù texts were scribbled by egotistical humans high on power trips and ancient pharmakon. They risk (and often lose) tenure and funding just to prove the Bible is about as infallible as a wet paper towel. That‚Äôs right: the God of the gaps has gaps big enough to drive a mining dump-truck through.

And don‚Äôt get me started on peer review: a once a noble watchdog, now a rabid chihuahua guarding its bone of orthodoxy and agenda. Challenge the sacred narrative, and the pack circles, the teeth come out, and you‚Äôre torn apart in a flurry of rejection letters. Academia‚Äôs glass ceiling isn‚Äôt made of glass; it‚Äôs a reinforced vault that crushes originality and encourages scholars to emulate Pavlov‚Äôs dogs: bark the right buzzwords, wag your citation tail, and maybe, just maybe, you get your damn paycheck.

Carlo Cipolla nailed it: stupid people hurt everyone around them while gaining fuck-all for themselves, and that randomness makes them FAR more lethal than ANY¬†calculated villain. In religious academe, that chaos shows up as blind faith cheering on atrocities, groupthink that buries inconvenient truths, and careerist vultures feeding on the carcass of curiosity. You can argue with malice... but stupidity? It stabs you in the back while you‚Äôre busy fighting the front. (See the academics and YouTubers going after \[but never against\] Ammon for reference...)

So here‚Äôs the bottom line: shatter the stained‚Äëglass windows, burn the fuckin idols, rip the velvet rope off the Ivory Tower, and pop peer-review right between its blinded eyes.. Raise a middle finger to anyone who demands you keep quiet or tow some holy line. Respect the philologists, assist the truth‚Äëseekers who aren‚Äôt afraid to get their hands dirty, and let them expose the scriptures without red ink from terrified editors... oh AND ELEVATE OUR OWN TENACITY AND WORK ETHIC IN THIS IMMENSE ENDEAVOUR! Because only when we crush the machinery of institutional stupidity can we reclaim the freedom to think... and that, my friends, is the most savage revolution of all.

We have booked tickets to come visit in December around the holidays. We are primarily visiting this time to evaluate neighborhoods we could actually see ourselves living in, so we are most interested in doing non-touristy things to get a real feel. 

Things we value:
- Dog friendly (we have 2 pups), so clean and walkable with access to green space
- Good markets and grocery stores
- Close knit neighborhood feel
- Nice night life but nothing crazy loud with clubs etc 
- Access to public transportation 
- Walkable cafes for morning coffees

He paused, silent. I pressed on.

""You're mine this weekend. I can give you the attention you deserve.""

""God, baby girl‚Ä¶ you don't have to say that.""

Feeling bold, I had to try. ""Just this once, I can do this.""

I reached for his manhood, but he stopped me. ""Don't. If your mother finds out‚Äî""

""I'd never tell anyone, Daddy. And you wouldn't either‚Ä¶ right?""

My voice trembled, hopeful and scared all at once.

And when my hand finally touched him, I suddenly knew‚Äîthis was really going to happen.



Chapter 1

Ella

I watched my stepfather Alexander from the doorway, standing on the patio with his back turned to me. I knew he was talking to my mom and I bet it was about work.

His hand waved in the air as he paced in slow circles, the phone pressed tightly to his ear. I leaned against the frame, crossing my arms over my chest as I watched the man I considered more of a parent than the woman on the other end of the call.

My mom, Lilith Hawthrone, met Alexander when I was really young. I don‚Äôt remember much of that time, but not long after they started dating, they decided to get married. I remember walking down the aisle with a little flower basket, too small to understand the significance of what was happening but old enough to remember how happy I felt that day.

My mom was an moderately famous actor. While my step dad was just‚Ä¶ just Alexander. A man with a kind voice and an even softer heart. He never made much money, but that never mattered to her. I‚Äôve heard her say what a kind and loving person Alexander is. I guessed maybe Love did conquer all things, even a workaholic like my mom. At least that‚Äôs what I thought.

After the wedding, Alexander finally moved in with us, it was like I finally understood what it meant to have real parents. My biological father disappeared before I was even born, and my mom‚Ä¶ Well, she did her best to care for me, just not in the traditional sense.

There were no bedtime stories, no hugs after bad dreams, no helping with homework or sitting at school plays. She had her career to focus on, I guess to her, just giving me a comfortable life was enough mothering.

Luckily, Alexendaert came into my life when he did. And it didn‚Äôt take long for him to become a core part of it. He made me breakfast everyday, drove me to school, listened to my ramblings about boys and friends and the books I was reading. He didn‚Äôt just step into the role of a stepfather. He became my dad.

When I got my first period, it wasn‚Äôt my mom who noticed. It was Alexander. He didn‚Äôt panic or make me feel weird about it. He handed me a heating pad and calmly explained what was happening to my body. He even bought me my first pack of pads.

And when my first boyfriend broke my heart, it was Alexander who found me crying in my room. He didn‚Äôt offer solutions or tell me it wasn‚Äôt real love. He just sat beside me, handed me tissues, and promised that he‚Äôd always be there for me no matter what.

He wasn‚Äôt just a stepdad. He was two parents in one. Which is why it hurt so much to see my mom yelling at him.

I stepped out onto the patio and Alexander stopped mid sentence and turned to me. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? Daddy‚Äù I asked him calmly.

He glanced down at the phone in his hand, and I noticed Mom was still on the line. He gave a short laugh ‚ÄúOh, nothing, Ella. Just the usual. Your mother putting her work over her family again. It‚Äôs like she doesn‚Äôt know when to stop.‚Äù

From the speaker, I heard mom sigh ‚ÄúUrgh, I can‚Äôt deal with this right now, Alex,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to you later.‚Äù

And just like that, the line went dead.

Alexander stared at the phone for a moment longer before finally lowering it to his side. I stood there, feeling strangely hollow. She hadn‚Äôt even been speaking to me, but somehow I still felt like the one who got told off.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I said quietly.

He shook his head and waved it off, though his mouth pressed into a tight line. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault. She‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ busy. Always busy.‚Äù He looked out across the yard, the porch light casting a dull glow over the garden. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I still let myself get disappointed.‚Äù

I took a slow step closer. ‚ÄúIs there anything I can do?‚Äù

He gave me a sad smile. ‚ÄúNot unless you can convince the travel agent to refund those tickets I bought for me and your mother. But I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs a lost cause.‚Äù

My eyebrows rose. ‚ÄúWait, she canceled the trip?‚Äù

He nodded, letting out a deep breath through his nose. ‚ÄúJust now. Said something came up with work, I asked her if to reschedule, because we;‚Äôve planned this like forever, but I guess I'm just not high up on her priority list.‚Äù

My chest tightened. I remembered how excited he had been about the trip, he‚Äôd mentioned it almost every day for the past month. ‚ÄúBut you were really looking forward to it,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he admitted, looking away. ‚ÄúI was. I planned everything. Even booked the room with the balcony facing the lake.‚Äù

My throat ached. ‚ÄúHow do you know the tickets are non-refundable?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll call tomorrow to check, but I‚Äôm pretty sure, I read on the website that there were no refunds"" He gave a dry laugh. ‚ÄúGuess that‚Äôs on me for rushing to book premium in advance""

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you sell them to someone else?‚Äù I asked, though even as I said it, I realized it probably wasn‚Äôt realistic.

He shrugged. ‚ÄúI could try. But the retreat‚Äôs next weekend. Not exactly ideal timing for people to make last-minute plans.‚Äù

We stood there for a moment, the silence stretching between us. The night had grown darker, the sky above scattered with stars, and the occasional chirp of crickets was the only sound.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said, trying to sound upbeat, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just go yourself? It can‚Äôt be that bad, right?‚Äù

He turned to look at me, a hint of surprise in his expression. ‚ÄúYou want me to go to a couples retreat‚Ä¶emphasius on ‚Äòcouple‚Äô. Alone?‚Äù

I realized how that looked immediately and I blushed. Alexander laughed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be the only single weirdo there.‚Äù There was a long pause before he added, more quietly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get over it, besides I‚Äôm more worried about next year. When you leave for college‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll just be me in this big old house.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. He was right. I had taken a gap year after high school, but in a few months, I‚Äôd be leaving. A few hours away wasn‚Äôt far, but it would still feel like a world apart. I‚Äôd be starting a new life, meeting new people, while he would be here‚Ä¶ alone.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to be lonely,‚Äù I said softly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine, I'll probably just get like fifty cats to keep me company"" he replied and I laughed at that.

We sat down together on the patio bench. The air had grown colder, and I pulled my cardigan tighter around me. Then, after a while, I turned to him and said, ‚ÄúDaddy, I can go with you.‚Äù

Chapter 2

Ella

Alexander didn‚Äôt respond right away. He just looked at me with a furrowed brow, like he wasn‚Äôt sure whether to laugh or be horrified by what I‚Äôd just said.

Then he exhaled and said, ‚ÄúElla‚Ä¶ this trip, it‚Äôs a couples‚Äô retreat. Everything there is designed for romance. Candlelit dinners, intimacy workshops. You‚Äôd have to pretend we were, well‚Ä¶ together.‚Äù

He said it like it was the biggest deal in the world, but to me, it really wasn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù I replied casually, tilting my head at him.

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù he echoed, like he couldn‚Äôt believe I wasn‚Äôt fazed. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you be embarrassed?‚Äù

I rolled my eyes and shrugged. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a free island vacation. I‚Äôm not gonna pass on that just because we‚Äôll have to play pretend for a weekend. I can be your fake wife. I won‚Äôt break character.‚Äù

He blinked, clearly thrown off. ‚ÄúElla‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean,‚Äù I said with a grin, ‚Äúyou get to show off a hot young wife. Not a bad deal.‚Äù

He groaned and covered his face with one hand. ‚ÄúGod, don‚Äôt say that.‚Äù

I nudged his arm with my elbow. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overthink it daddy.‚Äù

He looked at me then, really looked at me, his mouth pressed into a thin line as if trying to read between the lines of my smile.

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want people getting the wrong idea,‚Äù he said eventually, his voice low.

I shrugged again, brushing it off. ‚ÄúLet them. It‚Äôs just a weekend. Nobody there even knows you.‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù

I poked him in the arm. ‚ÄúYes daddy.‚Äù

He gave a soft chuckle, shaking his head. ‚ÄúFine. You can come. But no more of those jokes, okay? None of that ‚Äòhot young wife‚Äô stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, no promises,‚Äù I replied with a cheeky smile.

He rolled his eyes but didn‚Äôt push further. He knew me well enough to expect I‚Äôd keep teasing. I always did. But he didn‚Äôt know the truth behind my smile. He didn‚Äôt know that deep down, I wanted more than just to joke about it. I wanted him to expect something from this little act we were about to put on. I wanted the pretending to feel real.

It wasn‚Äôt new, this feeling I had for Alexander. I‚Äôd carried it with me for years. An ill-timed, confusing fascination that never fully went away. Maybe it started because he meant so much to me. Maybe it was because he gave me the attention and care I never got from my mother. Or maybe it was because I had always believed selfishly, foolishly, that she didn‚Äôt deserve him.

He was too patient, too loyal, too softhearted to be wasted on someone like her.

I used to imagine a different version of life. One where he saw her for who she really was and walked away. One where he realized he didn‚Äôt have to stay out of obligation. One where I was more than just his stepdaughter. I used to imagine what it would be like if he let himself see me differently.

But I was older now. Smarter. I knew better. I knew those fantasies belonged in my head and nowhere else.

After Alexander agreed to let me come, I didn‚Äôt waste any time getting things in order the next day. I quickly found people to cover my weekend shifts at the restaurant. Most of the summer staff were heading back to college anyway, so a few of them were eager to grab any last-minute opportunities to earn extra cash before classes started. It wasn‚Äôt hard to trade shifts. Everyone understood how rare it was to get a spontaneous vacation like this.

Alexander handed me his credit card without much ceremony. ‚ÄúUse this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch your savings.‚Äù

I blinked at him. ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù

He gave me a look. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing me a favor by coming, remember?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt argue. I spent the afternoon at the mall, picking out two new swimsuits, sunscreen, and a pair of sandals that were way too expensive but way too cute to resist. I even picked up a flowy white dress that I imagined would look nice against the ocean backdrop. I didn‚Äôt tell Alexander about the lingerie I slipped into the shopping bag too. It wasn‚Äôt like I had plans to wear it in front of him‚Ä¶ but something in me could only hope.

Mom didn‚Äôt pay much attention to any of it. She was in the middle of tech rehearsals for some new play she‚Äôd been cast in, and every time I passed her in the house, she was either talking on the phone with her director or rushing out the door. When I mentioned the trip, she just nodded distractedly and said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine. Just text when you land.‚Äù

The only time she showed any emotion was Friday morning as Alexander and I were loading up the car. She stood in the doorway holding a cup of coffee, dressed in a silk robe and barely awake. She pretended to be regretful and said that she couldn't go.

And that was it.

The drive to the airport was quiet. I could tell Alexander was trying not to seem disappointed by her last-minute detachment, but I caught the way his mouth tightened and how his knuckles turned white on the steering wheel. I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just reached for the radio and found a station playing soft jazz, something to fill the passing of time.

The three-hour flight from New York to Miami wasn‚Äôt too bad. We had entertained ourselves as best we could before takeoff. I made a game out of pointing out passengers I thought were going to the same retreat and guessing their backstories. Alexander played along, laughing more than I expected him to.

Once we were in the air, I leaned back in my seat and put on my headphones. The hum of the plane, the white noise of air circulation, and the faint music in my ears should‚Äôve lulled me into a peaceful nap.

But the sleep I got was anything but peaceful.

I dreamed I was lying in a bed that seemed to swallow me. Fingers brushed over my skin, slow and steady. They traced over my arms, my stomach, my thighs, pausing to press deeper each time. Each touch made me breathe faster and lift my hips, craving more.

I could feel them sliding past my body and playing in my moist vaginal opening. My whole body was immersed in ecstasy, and my hands continued to tease my most sensitive parts. At the doorway, a new figure came over. This person's complexion is much fairer than others' and can be recognized at a glance.

Alexander, my stepfather.

Chapter 3

Ella

I have never seen my father naked, but his body enables me to recognize him at a glance. When I was a teenager, I tried many times and saw him take off his clothes in various ways.

I should have told him to stop, but I couldn't control myself anymore. The pleasure that all these hands bring to me is just too intense. Watching him hungrily examine my body, his penis throbbing and standing firm left me with no resistance at all.

He moved over me and spread my thighs wide. He pressed closer until his lips touched mine. I couldn‚Äôt stop him. His hands held my thighs open, and his skin burned against mine.

I felt him hard and ready. He pushed in slowly, filling me inch by inch. It was deep and steady, and every second made me want more. There was no pain, only the weight of his body joining with mine.

I arched my back and tried to cry out, but no sound came. His breath brushed my neck. His lips dragged along my skin. I grabbed the sheets, trembling at the edge of release.

Then it all disappeared.

I jolted awake in my seat, my eyes flying open, the hum of the airplane engines pressing back into my ears like reality rushing in through a crack in the wall. I looked around, dazed and breathless, my skin flushed with heat. The cabin lights were dimmed. Most people were still sleeping. I turned my head.

Alexander was still asleep beside me, slouched comfortably against his seat, his chest rising and falling steadily beneath the soft gray t-shirt he wore. His face was peaceful. Innocent.

The dream had felt so real. My heart was pounding, and worse, my body was still reacting. I crossed my legs tightly. I could feel it, the aftermath of that dream, between my thighs. Wetness.

I bit my lip and looked down at myself, praying nothing showed through my clothes. I tugged the edges of my sweatshirt lower. The fabric of my panties clung to me, soaked through, and I shifted uncomfortably in my seat.

And as if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, my eyes kept drifting again and again, to the gym shorts Alexander was wearing, to the outline of his dick creating a bulge through the fabric as I glanced at his crotch.

I couldn‚Äôt stop my gaze from staring there, and from wondering if he‚Äôd had dreams too. If he‚Äôd wake up and somehow know. If he would see in my eyes how much I have craved him and how much my body ached for him.

Thankfully, he stayed asleep for the rest of the flight. I didn‚Äôt have to talk or pretend to hold a normal conversation. I just stared out the window and tried to get my breathing under control.

When we finally landed and disembarked, I still felt shaky. We made our way out of the airport and boarded a shuttle bus that would take us to the resort. I climbed into the backseat beside him, trying to act normal.

I pressed my forehead lightly to the window and let the scenery pass by in a blur. I stole a glance at him again as the bus curved along the coastal highway, sunlight flickering through the window and casting warm streaks across his arms.

He really was beautiful. And that was the worst part. He was a very attractive man, tall and lanky with a fit body.

I remembered when Alexander first started working out. He had started out subtly at first. An occasional jog around the block, a set of push-ups in the morning. But over time, it became more serious. He had told me once that it helped him clear his head, that it gave him something to focus on that wasn‚Äôt my mother.

I hadn‚Äôt understood back then just how much her obsession with work had worn him down. Maybe I‚Äôd just gotten used to seeing him disappointed, the way his voice always dropped when Mom canceled a dinner or skipped out on a weekend plan. I think the exercise was his way of taking back some part of himself. And the results were obvious.

His body had changed in the past year. He used to be lean, kind of limber and thin, like the college nerd he once was. He told me he spent most of his undergrad school years coding and building model robots, too busy for parties or dating.

But now, there was muscle beneath the softness. Not in an overwhelming way, just‚Ä¶ defined. His shoulders had broadened, his chest filled out under his shirts, and even the casual way he rested his arm on the seat beside me looked different now, stronger, more relaxed, more confident. It was no wonder he turned heads when we walked through the airport. But that didn‚Äôt justify me thinking of him in that way.

He was my stepfather. My dad, in every way that counted. And even though I‚Äôd had more than one confusing moment over the years, I told myself it didn‚Äôt mean anything. It shouldn‚Äôt mean anything.

Yes, there was no reason to think of him in that way.

But when we got to the resort and checked in at the front desk, I began to feel uneasy. We stepped into the suite, and the first thing I saw was the massive bed that took a significant portion of the room.

An enormous, white-sheeted, king-sized bed.

I froze in the doorway, my fingers tightening around the handle of my carry-on.

‚ÄúUh,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs only one bed.‚Äù

Alexander gave a small laugh, like it didn‚Äôt surprise him. ‚ÄúYeah, I figured. This is a couples resort, after all. Pretty sure asking for an extra bed would get us a lecture about ‚Äòtogetherness‚Äô or something.‚Äù

I tried to laugh too, but it came out awkward and stiff.

He walked past me and dropped his bag near the foot of the bed, then turned and gave me a half-smile. ‚ÄúThink they ºd be mad if we just cut it in half?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think that might cause an issue,‚Äù I giggled and said the bold words. ‚ÄúThere ºs enough space that we could probably share it comfortably daddy, just like the past‚Äù

My heart began pounding harder in my chest.

The very idea of lying next to him, breathing in the same air, maybe brushing against his arm in the middle of the night, it lit a fire low in my stomach. He was the very object of my deepest, most secret forbidden desires.

Chapter 4

Ella

I stared at the bed for a moment longer, then looked over at him. My cheeks flushed. ‚ÄúWhat? No,‚Äù He waved it off quickly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve grown up, I‚Äôll take couch.‚Äù

Failed.

I nodded, swallowing the lump in my throat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôll figure it out.‚Äù

Wanting desperately to change the subject and ease the tension, I let my eyes wander around the suite. That‚Äôs when I noticed it, a sleek, bubbling hot tub tucked into the corner near the wide balcony windows, with a chilled bottle of champagne in a silver bucket and two tall glasses sitting beside it. The sight alone looked like something out of a honeymoon ad.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said brightly, ‚ÄúDaddy, that hot tub looks amazing. Maybe we should start our vacation by doing the one thing people actually come here for‚Ä¶ relaxing.‚Äù

He followed my gaze and nodded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a bad idea.‚Äù

Another chance.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go chang in the living room‚Äù I said as I grabbed my bag and headed for the adjoining small living room within the huge suite, gently closing the door behind me. My heart was still thudding hard in my chest, not from nerves this time, but from anticipation. I knew I was playing with fire. I just wasn‚Äôt sure whether I wanted to stop.

Inside the room, I placed the bag on a sofa and dug out one of my new bathing suits, the strappy one I‚Äôd hesitated over at the store but bought anyway. I pulled off my shirt, then my jeans. The moment I did, a rush of scent hit my face and that‚Äôs when I noticed it‚Ä¶ my underwear.

The scent of my own desire was unmistakable, rising faintly into the quiet of the room. I paused, blinking at the realization. I hadn‚Äôt thought the dream on the plane would still be affecting me like this, but it was clear now that it had. More than I wanted to admit.

I quickly peeled off the damp panties, and folded them tightly before stuffing them deep into the pocket of my jeans. Then I slipped into the new bathing suit, adjusting the thin fabric around my chest and hips, silently hoping that I looked confident and effortless, and that Daddy wouldn ºt notice in the short time it took me to get into the hot tub.

When I stepped back into the main room, I paused near the doorway and called out, ‚ÄúCan I come in?‚Äù

His voice came from somewhere near the tub, laced with amusement. ‚ÄúNot unless you want to see the show.‚Äù

I hesitated for a bit.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine now, you can come in.‚Äù he said.

I laughed and pushed the door open. I didn‚Äôt look at him, just walked straight toward the bubbling water and climbed in quickly before he could make another comment. The warmth of the water wrapped around my body like a blanket, easing some of the tension from my muscles.

He looked over at me, his eyebrows raised slightly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ very little fabric.‚Äù

I glanced down at myself, then tilted my head toward him. ‚ÄúDo you like it daddy?‚Äù

He gave a low chuckle, but there was a glint of something unreadable in his eyes. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get used to the fact that you‚Äôve grown up.‚Äù

That made my breath catch for half a second. I looked away, unsure what to say, and that‚Äôs when my gaze unintentionally dropped, just for a moment, toward the bulge in the crotch of his swim trunks.

I looked away quickly, scolding myself silently.

Alexander stepped into the tub a moment later, letting out a moan of comfort as the water hit his skin. The sound sent a flutter through my chest. I reached for the tray beside us, grabbing the champagne and glasses.

‚ÄúWant to pour us some?‚Äù I asked, hoping my voice sounded steady.

Alexander gave me a strange look as I handed him the bottle and one of the glasses. ‚ÄúUs?‚Äù he asked, lifting an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt drink.‚Äù

I gave him a wry little smile. ‚ÄúDaddy, I‚Äòm eighteen. I can drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good idea,‚Äù he muttered, already opening the bottle and carefully pouring a glass‚Ä¶ for himself.

I folded my arms. ‚ÄúSo, I don‚Äôt even get one?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù he said simply, taking a sip. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still my responsibility this weekend.‚Äù

I let out a dramatic sigh and leaned my head on his shoulder. ‚ÄúCome on, daddy. I‚Äôm tired. We flew for hours. I‚Äôve earned at least one glass.‚Äù

He tried to stay firm, but I could feel him relax a little under my weight. I peeked up at him with my most pitiful expression, eyes wide and pleading. ‚ÄúJust one,‚Äù I whispered, drawing it out like a child asking for dessert.

He sighed again, more defeated this time. ‚ÄúFine. One. But that‚Äôs it.‚Äù

I smiled and hugged him, more out of gratitude than playfulness, though I couldn‚Äôt ignore the way his body felt through the thin fabric of my swim suit. Warm, strong. My chest pressed to his arm, and I held on just a second too long before pulling away.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre best,‚Äù I said lightly, pretending I hadn‚Äôt just gotten turned on by something so simple.

He handed me a glass and I took a sip. Bubbles danced on my tongue, crisp and sweet. I tried not to moan at how good it tasted, or how good it felt just to be sitting there with him like this.

After I finished, I glanced at his still half-full glass and held mine out.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said immediately.

I pouted. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were going to ask for more.‚Äù

I smiled innocently. ‚ÄúI was just curious if you were planning to finish the whole bottle alone.‚Äù

He gave me a long, skeptical look, then poured a little more into my glass.

One glass turned into two, then into three. Somehow, between leaning against him and making soft conversation, the bottle slowly emptied. I couldn‚Äôt tell whether it was the warmth of the tub or the champagne, but my body felt loose, like it was floating. I stayed close to him, letting my head rest lightly against his shoulder again.

And that‚Äôs when the ache started creeping back in.

The dream. The plane. The bed.

I tried not to think about it, tried not to notice the heat pooling low in my stomach. But every time his voice rumbled beside me, or his thigh shifted against mine underwater, I felt myself react. My legs tensed. My skin buzzed. And before I realized it, my left hand had slipped between my thighs, as I began to stroke my pussy lightly over my swimsuit.

I let out a quiet breath through my nose, hoping he wouldn‚Äôt notice.

Then I asked, ‚ÄúAre you happy with Mom?‚Äù

The question came out softer than I intended, and he turned his head slightly to look at me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ complicated.‚Äù

I nodded slowly, fingers still barely moving under the surface. ‚ÄúI just wish she paid more attention to you. If you were mine‚Ä¶ I would.‚Äù

There was a pause. His eyes locked on me. I continued, ‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôre mine this weekend, remember? I can give you the attention you deaserve.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod Baby girl, you don‚Äôt have to say that-‚Äù The words were low and husky, and I could tell the alcohol was working its way into him too. His body had relaxed completely in the water.

Feeling bold, I decided to try.

‚ÄúDaddy, you‚Äôre the best man I‚Äôve even seen‚Äù I murmured, sliding my left hand away from myself, ‚ÄúJust for once, I guess I can do this‚Ä¶‚Äù and quickly reached for his dick in the water.

His eyes widened as he grabbed my hand. ‚ÄúElla, don‚Äôt,‚Äù he took a deep breath, ‚ÄúIt ºs not right, if your mother knows...‚Äù

I leaned closer, meeting his gaze, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never tell anyone daddy. And you wouldn‚Äôt either... right?‚Äù

My voice was hopeful, terrified that I would be rejected.

But when my hand moved rapidly across the water and touched his erected manhood, suddenly understanding that this was real, that this was going to happen.",1,1752946247.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1m41xju,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m41xju/how_do_you_keep_a_flirty_coworker_dynamic_fun_and/,How do you keep a flirty coworker dynamic fun and harmless ‚Äî as part of your glow-up era?,"There‚Äôs this guy at work. He‚Äôs French (yes, charming), recently joined in a higher-level position but in a different department. We worked together on a project, and it quickly became clear that we got along really well ‚Äî easy banter, interesting conversations, and that lowkey, mutual flirtation that makes the corporate grind slightly more tolerable.

He‚Äôs not subtle. He‚Äôll ask me to lunch, dinner, drinks. I usually tease him and decline, but occasionally we do go ‚Äî if our schedules match. Nothing wild. Just relaxed drinks or a meal with a lot of smiling, slightly-too-long eye contact, and some light touching. It‚Äôs a vibe.

He‚Äôs also very openly dating other women. He recently went on a trip with one. I‚Äôm not reading into it ‚Äî I know he‚Äôs not interested in me that way, and I‚Äôm not hoping for anything. He once turned down an invite I sent for after-work drinks, saying he had plans with someone else but ‚Äúpreferred my company‚Äù‚Ä¶ so yeah. He enjoys the attention and the flirt tension, but he‚Äôs not that emotionally available.

Texting-wise, he says he‚Äôs overwhelmed by messages and prefers calls or in-person. I‚Äôm a texter, so this has always felt like a mismatch. But when I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôm not in the headspace to talk or hang out, he says I can always call him, that he‚Äôs open to listening. It sounds nice, but feels vague and not something I take seriously. He did tell me he wanted to strike a middle ground for our mismatch in habits and did notify me how he is. Not that I believe him.

I‚Äôm also quite introverted by nature. I can be warm and social when needed, especially in a professional setting, but outside of work, I‚Äôm private, selective, and cautious with my energy. I‚Äôm not trying to get emotionally invested in someone who clearly isn‚Äôt ready for depth.

But I do enjoy the dynamic. It‚Äôs playful, occasionally flattering, and honestly good practice. I‚Äôm working on myself ‚Äî physically, emotionally, socially ‚Äî and part of that includes learning how to be more at ease with flirting, confidence, and self-expression. He‚Äôs not ‚Äúthe one‚Äù (if anything, the opposite), but he‚Äôs a good way to stretch that part of me that‚Äôs been closed off for a while.

He sometimes tries to strike up conversations in the office, but if I‚Äôm already engaged or moving fast between things, he gives up. Still, when I invite him to random things like a coffee run or midday walk, he really seems to enjoy it. I do that sparingly ‚Äî to keep it light.

We‚Äôve also built a bit of a friendship. He asks for my advice on things like which flats to move into, and has actually followed my recommendations. I‚Äôve made comments about his sometimes questionable fashion choices, and now he‚Äôll ask for input on what to wear. I once joked that with the way he keeps asking for advice, he‚Äôd probably make me help pick out furniture when he moves ‚Äî and he laughed, saying that might be too much to ask from me. (He says that, but I‚Äôm half-sure he‚Äôd still ask.)

On the flip side, I once asked him to buy me something small during one of his solo trips. He didn‚Äôt. Not a big deal, but just one of those subtle data points ‚Äî I give him attention, input, a little warmth, but he doesn‚Äôt give much back unless it‚Äôs on his terms. It‚Äôs pretty clear he‚Äôs not actually interested. He just enjoys the vibe.

So here‚Äôs my question:
How do you maintain a fun, harmless flirtation with someone like this without it getting confusing or emotionally messy? I want to keep enjoying the banter and energy ‚Äî not as a lead-up to something, but as a tool for my own glow-up and confidence journey.

Your opinion can stem from your own personal experiences or experiences that you‚Äôve heard from others.

I know the terms ‚Äòbest‚Äô and ‚Äòworst‚Äô can be subjective, and I think many factors can play into that: salary, team/people, managers/partners, toxicity, work-life balance, etc. It just depends on how you would classify it!

Perhaps try to be as specific as possible in terms of the department or group. For example, Deals Advisory has many groups within it (Technology Risk, Global Infrastructure Advisory, Governance, Risk & Compliance, Management Consulting, etc.).

Just for some context, I am personally interested in Management Consulting (even though I‚Äôm in another group) due to the variety of projects I‚Äôve heard about in coffee chats.

I'm pretty sure I know why I wound up on this list-- I received some random walmart junk from in-laws and coworkers over Christmas this year and took it all to Walmart to return it because I needed the money.  It was a bunch of those dumb holiday gift boxes like Reese's coffee mugs, ""fun socks"", hot sauces, and axe body spray.  I was a bit surprised because they are low dollar amount items and it may have been five things this year.  It couldn't have even been $50.  Today I returned an absolutely massive box of diapers that we got as a diaper party gift that the baby grew out of.  I just wanted to exchange it for the same thing but a size larger but apparently they don't do that anymore (stupid) so the only option was to return it, and that apparently put me over this invisible threshold

Does anyone know if there's a period of time that it expires or what I can do from a behavioral standpoint to get back in their good graces? There's definitely going to be a scenario in the future where I need to return something without a receipt.    ",0,1752945979.0,walmart,10,0.3,False

¬† LOCATION: 13th Psalm Safehouse ‚Äî Arizona¬†

TIME: 0340 Hours¬†

WEATHER: Rain lashes the windows.¬†

¬†

Jane sits alone in silence. Her boots are still streaked with mud. The TV glows with static behind her as she listens to the squad‚Äôs comms playing back on loop‚ÄîVega yelling, Martinez barking orders, Lou's voice low, controlled, and detached. Until it wasn‚Äôt. She closes her eyes.

¬†

Then the air shifts. Not with temperature, but with memory. The walls feel farther away, and the sound of the rain is dull. Something steps into her soul as if it were slipping into an old pair of shoes.

¬†

Entity.

¬†

It doesn‚Äôt speak at first; it just exists, watching the same things she sees and feeling what she feels. Then it begins to remember.

ENTITY (softly, slowly):¬†

There was a hill...¬†

A hill outside the city walls...¬†

And a man carrying a tree on his back.¬†

¬†

Jane‚Äôs eyes snap open. Her skin prickles with cold and awe.

¬†

ENTITY:

They beat Him... but He kept walking.¬†

Not for vengeance.¬†

For love. For war.¬†

A war unseen.¬†

¬†

The thunder cracks‚Äîsharp, divine. Jane rises slowly from the chair, drawn to the voice. Her mouth is dry, and her hands are shaking.

¬†

ENTITY (now deeper, older):¬†

He walked among the jackals...¬†

And let them bite.¬†

That was not weakness. That was the strike before the storm.¬†

¬†

A flash of light fills the room‚Äînot lightning, but a vision. For a moment, Jane sees it: a man, bleeding and broken, stumbling under the weight of the cross. He is not just human; he is more. His eyes look straight at her across time.

¬†

ENTITY (voice layered with echoes):¬†

Lou Phillips carries the weight of a bloodline that must be purified.¬†

The knife in his hands is not revenge.¬†

It is scripture.¬†

¬†

Jane falls to her knees, breath caught in her throat.

¬†

JANE:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre... remembering, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù¬†

¬†

ENTITY (whispering):¬†

Yes. I was once a flame.¬†

A sword in His hand.¬†

Until I was cast out with the rest‚Ä¶¬†

¬†

JANE (softly, afraid):¬†

‚ÄúSo what am I to you?‚Äù¬†

¬†

The voice grows gentle‚Äîtoo gentle for something so ancient.

¬†

ENTITY:

You are my redemption, Jane.¬†

And he... Lou...¬†

He is the storm.¬†

Let him be it.¬†

¬†

ENTITY(final, absolute):¬†

It was always going to be him.¬†

Jeff is his cross to carry.¬†

And the Book confirms it:¬†

¬†

\> ‚ÄúHe teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.‚Äù ‚Äî Psalm 18:34¬†

¬†

She breathes deeply. The rain outside becomes rhythmic and calmer. Jane finally stands and looks into the cracked mirror. Her reflection stares back, but something else glows behind her eyes.

¬†

She smiles‚Äînot with peace, but with certainty.

¬†

JANE:

‚ÄúAlright, Lou... I won‚Äôt take this from you.‚Äù¬†

PSALM 13 ‚Äî ACT II: DEBRIEF

LOCATION: Forward Operating Safehouse, Pennsylvania¬†

TIME: 0515 Hours¬†

ATMOSPHERE: Quiet. Dim. Coffee brews. Mud tracks the floor. Everyone‚Äôs bloodied. Everyone‚Äôs tired.¬†

¬†

\[Scene opens with boots hitting tile. Heavy gear clanks against the floor.\]

¬†

Vega drops his blood-caked helmet onto the table, still panting. A cut traces along his jawline, not deep but vivid. Gonzales moves past him, rips open the fridge, and pulls a beer. No one stops him.

¬†

Lou stands in the center, silent, his eyes scanning and thinking‚Äîalways thinking.

¬†

MARTINEZ (breaking the silence):¬†

‚ÄúTwo dead dogs, three shredded trees, one helluva scream, and a full clip dumped into its spine‚Ä¶¬†

‚Ä¶and it still almost got Vega‚Äôs throat.‚Äù¬†

¬†

VEGA (snorting, nursing a bruised shoulder):¬†

‚ÄúAlmost.‚Äù¬†

¬†

MEDINA (tossing bloodied notes onto the table):¬†

‚ÄúI told you all it was fast. Nothing in nature should move like that. It‚Äôs got tunnel systems under the root clusters. That thing was playing with us.‚Äù¬†

¬†

NOLASCO groans, leaning against the wall with a rag pressed to a wound on his ribs.¬†

¬†

NOLASCO:¬†

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt feel like playing. Felt like we walked into its goddamn living room.‚Äù¬†

¬†

GONZALES (gesturing to Vega):¬†

‚ÄúYou put it down like Old Yeller on bath salts, though. Respect.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Vega doesn‚Äôt reply immediately; he looks down‚Äîquiet. He pulls out a crumpled photo of his kids. It has blood on it. He wipes it clean with his thumb.

¬†

VEGA ¬†(low):¬†

‚ÄúThree kids. Same age as mine. I saw the photos. What was left of them.‚Äù¬†

¬†

He grips the picture tighter.¬†

¬†

VEGA:

‚ÄúNo way I was letting that thing breathe another minute. No fucking way.‚Äù¬†

¬†

Silence. Heavy. Palpable. Lou finally speaks.¬†

¬†

LOU (firm, respectful):¬†

‚ÄúYou did good, Vega. That one goes on the wall. You earned it.‚Äù¬†

¬†

MARTINEZ (nodding):¬†

‚ÄúAnd the Rake‚Äôs off the board. But if that‚Äôs the type of escalation we‚Äôre seeing now‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

¬†

He trails off.¬†

¬†

MEDINA:

‚ÄúThen something worse is pushing these things out of hiding.‚Äù¬†

¬†

¬†

Lou (without hesitation): ‚ÄúAgreed.‚Äù Expect more; these things like to evolve. The longer these things are active, the more difficult it‚Äôs going to be to take them down.

¬†

¬†

Nolasco:

‚ÄúYou thinkin‚Äô it‚Äôs tied to Jeff?‚Äù

¬†

¬†

¬†

Lou (quietly): ""I think‚Ä¶ it's all connected. Like chess pieces falling into place. The Rake was just a rook. Something else is moving. There's a greater chance of Jeff stirring due to whatever's going on.""

They all pause. That chill down the spine moment. The idea that this is just the beginning.

¬†

Gonzales (trying to cut tension):

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ tacos or showers first?‚Äù

¬†

¬†

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúTacos. Then showers. Then maybe therapy.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

¬†

The team chuckles‚Äîjust a little. Enough to breathe again.

¬†

Lou (gruff smile):

We prep the next op. Everyone rest. Gear reset. Weapons cleaned. We move fast if something else surfaces.‚Äù

¬†

¬†

¬†

They all nod. It‚Äôs second nature now.

¬†

\[Lou walks out of the room, alone. The rest settle down to eat. Behind their joking and chewing‚Ä¶ their eyes betray it. Everyone knows: the Rake was just a warm-up.\]

CUT TO BLACK

¬†‚ÄúOrders Without Explanation‚Äù

LOCATION: 13th Psalm Safehouse ‚Äì Arizona Desert

TIME: Two Days Before Camp Coral Recon

¬†

Interior. Kitchen table. Harsh mid-morning light leaks through dirty blinds. Medina flips through a dossier on Onry≈ç sightings. Martinez loads mags one by one like rosary beads. Kaede hums a hymn in the hallway ‚Äî something ghostly, old. Jane sits silently.

¬†

Then Lou enters.

Boots coated in red dust. Long sleeves rolled. His presence rewrites the room‚Äôs posture.

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúMartinez. Medina. Gear up. You‚Äôre flying with me.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez (without looking up):

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúNew Jersey. Two-man recon and observation. I‚Äôll brief on the way.‚Äù

¬†

Medina (raising an eyebrow):

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pulling us outta the fort and not telling us why?‚Äù

¬†

Lou (cold, clipped):

‚ÄúI am telling you. Recon. Observation. You just don‚Äôt have the context yet.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez sets his mag down and squints at Lou. There‚Äôs something in Lou‚Äôs tone that sounds less like command and more like warning.

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúThis something we‚Äôve seen before?‚Äù

¬†

Lou (quietly):

‚ÄúNo. But the world‚Äôs seen echoes.‚Äù

¬†

Jane glances up. Doesn‚Äôt speak. She knows she‚Äôs not going. That stings.

¬†

Medina (smirking):

‚ÄúYou get spooked by another ghost movie again, boss?‚Äù

¬†

Lou (deadpan):

‚ÄúYou ever hear of the Camp Coral murders?‚Äù

¬†

A beat. Then Lou drops a small grainy photo on the table.

It‚Äôs a still from a traffic cam ‚Äî something massive, partially submerged in a lake. The timestamp is recent.

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúTwo nights ago. Near Camp Coral. Hikers found slaughtered. Gear untouched. No drag marks. No evidence of animal attack.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúJust violence. Then silence.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez (eyeing the image):

‚ÄúThat ain‚Äôt no bear.‚Äù

¬†

Lou (folding the photo):

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a bear.‚Äù

¬†

Medina:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre thinking it‚Äôs connected to a certain franchise, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

¬†

Lou (finally):

‚ÄúI think the movies were connected to this. Something real. Something old. A long time ago, people started writing down the shadows they couldn‚Äôt explain. Turned ‚Äòem into films. Turned pain into popcorn.‚Äù Like Kayako‚Äôs situation.

¬†

‚ÄúSomething made them write those stories in the first place.‚Äù

Lou (heading to the gear room):

‚ÄúWheels up in six hours. Bring quiet gear. No steel. No loud zippers. This isn‚Äôt a war. Not yet.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez (watching him go):

‚ÄúMan wants us to birdwatch at the set of ¬†a slasher film

¬†

Medina (under his breath):

‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs hope the director doesn‚Äôt kill us off.‚Äù

¬†

¬†‚ÄúSins in the Pines‚Äù

LOCATION: Inbound Military Transport ‚Äì En Route to New Jersey

TIME: Following Morning

The Chinook‚Äôs rotors hum like a giant‚Äôs heartbeat. Inside, Lou, Martinez, and Medina sit in silence. Across from them, a crate marked ‚ÄúSURV. OBS‚Äù rocks slightly in turbulence. Civilian clothes under tactical vests. Lightweight gear. This isn‚Äôt an assault.

¬†

Medina:

‚ÄúYou sure we‚Äôre not walking into a bad remake?‚Äù

¬†

Lou (calm):

‚ÄúThe old films they were based on something. Loosely. Masked figure. Forest. Campfire deaths. But what got sanitized for TV wasn‚Äôt the worst part.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs patterns. Every five to seven years. Reports get buried. Victims rarely identified. And always one common thread‚Ä¶‚Äù

He hands Medina a folded file. Inside: mugshots, redacted IDs, parole records.

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúThe people who die out there‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre never innocent. Petty felons. Domestic cases. Off-grid loners. Sometimes they‚Äôre just bad men who thought the woods wouldn‚Äôt notice.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúSo this thing‚Äôs some kinda‚Ä¶ forest cop?‚Äù

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs a judgment.‚Äù

¬†

Medina:

‚ÄúWhy are we going? We‚Äôre not ghosts. Or criminals.‚Äù

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôve seen things that don‚Äôt follow rules. If this thing does ‚Äî if it has rules ‚Äî that makes it valuable.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúUnderstandable monsters are safer than random ones.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúUnless it decides we‚Äôre not safe.‚Äù

¬†

Lou (without blinking):

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôd rather find out on our terms.‚Äù

¬†

¬†PSALM 13 : ‚ÄúThe Lake of the Dead‚Äù

LOCATION: Camp Coral Wilderness, Pine Barrens

TIME: 01:16 AM

¬†

The forest is still.

So quiet it almost sounds artificial.

Across the lake, a small cabin glows ‚Äî a family of four gathered around a propane fire. Laughter drifts across the water. A memory in motion.

¬†

Lou lies prone, scanning with binocs. Martinez watches through IR. Medina checks for seismic vibrations. Not for tremors ‚Äî for footsteps.

¬†

Martinez (deadpan):

‚ÄúWe staking out summer camp ghost stories now?‚Äù

¬†

Medina:

‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs either this or Kaede making us all tofu stew again.‚Äù

¬†

A soft ripple disturbs the lake. Not a fish. Not the wind. It feels intentional.

¬†

Something massive emerges.

¬†

It isn‚Äôt fast.

It doesn‚Äôt need to be.

¬†

A hulking shape steps from the water ‚Äî barnacle-chained jacket, broken mask, blade dull from use, not age.

The Revenant.

¬†

Medina (guttural):

‚Äú‚Ä¶he‚Äôs real.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez (hushed):

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the guy. The damn mask. That‚Äôs the movie monster.‚Äù

¬†

Lou (flat):

‚ÄúNo. That‚Äôs what the movie tried to be. This is older. Smarter. Worse.‚Äù

¬†

The Revenant stops near the family‚Äôs cabin. He doesn‚Äôt enter. He watches. The children sleep. The dog senses him and goes still. Then‚Ä¶ the Revenant bends down and picks up a discarded beer can.

¬†

He crushes it. Places it in a garbage bag hung on a tree hook. Then‚Ä¶ he turns. Slowly. Deliberately.

Looks straight at them.

¬†

Lou (standing):

‚ÄúHe sees us. Drop the suits. Show respect.‚Äù

¬†

They do.

Three men in tactical black, standing in reverent silence as the Revenant watches‚Ä¶ then turns back to the water.

¬†

He vanishes beneath the surface like a rumor. Like he was never there.

¬†

Medina (softly):

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ cleaning up the forest.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúThe Revenant. Saint of recycling and righteous vengeance.‚Äù

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs judgment. Pure and silent. He doesn‚Äôt rage. He remembers.‚Äù

¬†

Medina:

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt he come at us?‚Äù

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúBecause we haven‚Äôt earned it yet.‚Äù

¬†

¬†‚ÄúThe New Recruit‚Äù

LOCATION: Camp Coral ‚Äì Forest Edge

TIME: 04:02 A.M.

¬†

The plan was simple: show respect, leave no trace, stay out of sight.

¬†

They weren‚Äôt here to fight.

¬†

They were here to prove they understood the rules.

¬†

So the team cleaned.

¬†

Martinez is bagging litter left by careless hikers ‚Äî energy drink cans, broken glowsticks, a mangled iPod still half-playing Creed.

¬†

Lou drags a bundle of rusted fishing line and shattered tackle boxes into a burn pile.

¬†

Medina, meanwhile, is scrubbing graffiti off a half-collapsed dock. His movements are precise. Focused. Like every inch of the wood he wipes clean is earning them points with whatever‚Äôs watching.

¬†

Medina (muttering):

‚ÄúCamp spirit of vengeance likes tidy cabins. Who knew.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust me and the lake demon, chillin‚Äô at 4 A.M‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†

Then it starts.

¬†

The first pinecone lands at his boots.

¬†

Then another.

Then another.

Plunk.

Thunk.

One rolls in with unnatural precision, like it had aim.

¬†

Medina (squinting at the treeline):

‚ÄúAlright. I know that‚Äôs not wind.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wanna play, fine. I got time.‚Äù

¬†

He tosses one back.

¬†

Nothing happens for ten seconds. Then a larger pinecone ‚Äî a fat, spiky one ‚Äî sails through the air and smacks him in the forehead.

¬†

Medina (staggering back):

‚ÄúI swear to God‚Äî!‚Äù

¬†

From the other side of camp, Martinez nearly drops the trash bag laughing.

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúOh no. He made contact.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a confirmed strike on Specialist Medina.‚Äù

¬†

Lou (smirking):

‚ÄúTactical pinecone. I‚Äôd say the Revenant‚Äôs testing him.‚Äù

¬†

More small signs:

¬†

A stick poked into Medina‚Äôs toolbelt when he isn‚Äôt looking.

A smear of mud on his back in the shape of a crooked smile.

His water bottle‚Ä¶ missing. Then reappearing filled with glittering lakewater and a dead bug inside.

¬†

Medina (yelling into the woods):

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not some toy, you decomposing delinquent!‚Äù

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúNow now, let‚Äôs not insult the only thing here that hasn‚Äôt tried to kill us yet.‚Äù

¬†

Medina rips off his shirt, soaked in sweat and mud, and tosses it to the ground like a gauntlet.

¬†

Medina (panting):

‚ÄúYou want a square-up?! Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired, I‚Äôm undercaffeinated, and I‚Äôve been pranked by a cursed muppet for two hours straight!‚Äù

¬†

There‚Äôs a rustle.

Then silence.

¬†

Then‚Äîjust behind Medina‚Äîa thud.

¬†

He spins, fists up‚Äî

Only to find a stack of rocks balanced like a tiny person‚Ä¶

A single, small pinecone. top of it.

Like a peace offering. Or an apology.

¬†

Or‚Ä¶ a joke.

¬†

Lou (stepping beside him):

‚ÄúHe died as a kid, Medina.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre seeing ‚Äî the pinecones, the games ‚Äî it‚Äôs not malice. It‚Äôs boredom.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is how he plays.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúGreat. We came to observe a killing machine and ended up babysitting a haunted Boy Scout.‚Äù

¬†

Lou (nodding):

‚ÄúBetter than the alternative.‚Äù

¬†

Medina breathes deep. Looks into the woods.

¬†

He can feel the Revenant now. Still watching.

But the air doesn‚Äôt feel angry anymore.

¬†

Just‚Ä¶ curious.

¬†

Medina (defeated):

‚ÄúSo what ‚Äî he‚Äôs like our‚Ä¶ unofficial mascot now?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúPsalm 13‚Äôs undead raccoon child?‚Äù

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúUnofficial member. Call sign pending.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúI vote for ‚ÄòCampfire Carl.‚Äô‚Äù

¬†

Lou (grinning):

‚ÄúNope. He gets one when he earns his first patch.‚Äù

¬†

Somewhere in the dark, the Revenant leans against a pine tree, head tilted. A child‚Äôs soul in a giant‚Äôs body. Watching these strange men tidy his woods.

And for once, he doesn‚Äôt raise the machete.

¬†

If he could giggle he would.

Behind them, the lake rested ‚Äî smooth as obsidian. Nothing stirred.

¬†

But he was there.

Still.

Somewhere.

¬†

Watching.

¬†

Martinez slung his pack with a grunt.

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúIf I hear a single pinecone roll behind me, I‚Äôm shooting it.‚Äù

¬†

Medina:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd miss. He‚Äôd probably turn your shoelaces into a snake again.‚Äù

¬†

Lou (quietly):

‚ÄúEyes up. We‚Äôre not done yet.‚Äù

¬†

They passed through the inner perimeter of the forest ‚Äî and that‚Äôs when they saw them.

¬†

Signs of war.

¬†

Not just timeworn damage.

¬†

Wounds.

¬†

Trees sheared at angles no natural force could manage.

Deep gouges through bark that smelled faintly of sulfur.

And bones ‚Äî not human ‚Äî half-buried, gnawed on by time and something worse.

¬†

A clearing opened just ahead.

¬†

Their pace slowed to reverent steps.

¬†

The battlefield.

¬†

They moved like archaeologists at a cursed dig site.

¬†

A wendigo husk, folded backwards, ribs curled in like fingers clawing its own heart.

¬†

A Jersey Devil, impaled through its chest on a branch sharpened by something with very human anger.

¬†

A skinwalker skull, shattered and stuffed with pine needles and smooth stones ‚Äî maybe a ritual, maybe mockery.

¬†

And then the trophy:

A single Mothman wing, nailed to a fallen oak with a railroad spike, twitching once every few minutes like it still had somewhere to fly.

¬†

Martinez (in awe):

‚ÄúHe fought these. Alone.‚Äù

¬†

Lou (low, firm):

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt protect this place. He owns it.‚Äù

¬†

As they moved, they found a pyramid of trash ‚Äî a perfect stack.

¬†

Soda cans. Beer bottles. Snack wrappers. All stuff they had cleaned during their stay.

¬†

At the top of the stack was Medina‚Äôs shirt, freshly folded, pine-scented.

¬†

Medina:

‚Äú‚Ä¶Okay, that‚Äôs just weirdly wholesome.‚Äù

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúWhat, you wanted him to leave you a lunchable?‚Äù

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a message. We left no trace. He noticed.‚Äù

¬†

They neared the extraction ridge.

¬†

That‚Äôs when Martinez slowed. His head tilted toward the trees.

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúLou. Here. Now.‚Äù

¬†

The team gathered around a tree.

¬†

No ordinary tree.

¬†

Its bark was torn through with five deep claw marks ‚Äî thick, jagged, spaced perfectly apart like the strokes of some ancient god‚Äôs hand.

¬†

Ten feet tall.

¬†

Cut at a downward angle.

¬†

It wasn‚Äôt new.

¬†

But it hadn‚Äôt healed, either.

¬†

Sap bled from the marks, sticky and dark. Like old oil mixed with something worse.

¬†

Below it, the forest floor was charred ‚Äî not burned. Melted. Like heat from inside a dream.

¬†

And there, near the roots, a single black feather, curled and cracked, still pulsing faintly with leftover heat.

¬†

Medina (whispers):

‚Äú‚Ä¶No. No way.‚Äù

¬†

Lou (nodding, quietly):

‚ÄúYeah. The Revenant fought him. Right here.‚Äù

¬†

A long pause.

¬†

Medina (swallowing):

‚ÄúDid he win?‚Äù

¬†

Lou (soft):

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still here.

¬†

Beneath the claw marks, crudely carved into the trunk, were six words:

¬†

‚ÄúDREAMS DIE HERE. STAY AWAKE, OUTSIDER.‚Äù

¬†

No one said anything else.

¬†

They reached the chopper.

¬†

The pilot barely made eye contact. He‚Äôd been briefed to not ask questions. Just fly.

¬†

As the rotor blades spun up, Lou looked back one last time toward the trees.

¬†

And he saw him.

¬†

The Revenant.

¬†

Half-shadow. Half-giant.

¬†

Standing silently at the tree line.

¬†

No weapon drawn.

¬†

Just‚Ä¶ watching.

¬†

And then‚Ä¶

¬†

another shape.

¬†

Behind the trees. Just visible

A pale figure with no eyes.

Just dark hollows and long, impossible limbs.

¬†

The Slender One.

Observing.

¬†

Smiling.

¬†

Lou stares back.

¬†

They lifted off.

¬†

Camp Coral shrank beneath them ‚Äî swallowed by trees, mist, and memory.

¬†

The squad didn‚Äôt speak until the lake was gone from view.

¬†

Martinez:

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ we giving him a call sign?‚Äù

¬†

Lou:

‚ÄúGold thread. Black patch. No name.‚Äù

¬†

Medina:

‚ÄúUnofficial 7th member of 13th Psalm?‚Äù

¬†Lou (smirking):

‚ÄúNot a member.‚Äù

""Look, I don‚Äôt know what you heard, but none of this is real, alright? Just a story. Just some burnt-out punk scribblin‚Äô down half-memories and demon rumors. If it sounds like someone you know, well, maybe that‚Äôs your own damn problem. No one‚Äôs naming names. No one‚Äôs confessing anything. It‚Äôs all made up, yeah? Contracts, curses, dead principals grinning like they know something you don‚Äôt‚Äîbullshit fiction. So relax. Unless you're Coyote. In which case, hey, deal‚Äôs a deal.‚Äù

Now back to the story...

Im sitting on the edge of three towns. Victorville, Hesperia, and Apple Valley. Magic has always been wild at this specific spot. 

The old charter school I went to shut down a decade ago. Now it‚Äôs a realtor‚Äôs office, which makes things a little more complicated. I wanted to see if the curses I left behind were still there. I know they shouldn‚Äôt work anymore, probably never did. But it‚Äôd be just another cosmic joke if the place got flipped into something so bland, so harmless.

My mother always said the stalkers were why we had to keep moving. Couldn‚Äôt be her fault. Couldn‚Äôt be the way she turned neighbors into enemies because one of them wore a green shirt with blue shoes. Anything about them would trigger her. A glance, a cough, the color of their shoelaces.

I‚Äôm sitting in a caf√© that‚Äôs been here since high school. Back then, I used to have meetings here every Tuesday with the Zippo Man. It‚Äôs eerie how the place hasn‚Äôt changed. My usual table by the window still looks out toward the school, now an empty office building.

I try to shake the memories loose and take a sip of coffee. Strong. Warm. Like a hug that knows how to hurt just right.

The bell over the door rings. I don‚Äôt look up. But then I hear footsteps I recognize.

‚ÄúHey stranger. Figured I‚Äôd find you here,‚Äù Thomas says, pulling out the chair and giving me that look, can I sit?

I nod, sip again.

‚ÄúIt is Tuesday,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúFigured you stopped by the police station by now. And knowing you, you‚Äôd want to see the school again, from this spot.‚Äù

He takes in the scenery like I did. Same walls, same cracks, same ghosts.

‚ÄúOnly place with decent coffee,‚Äù I say, raising my cup.

‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs the only place you know of,‚Äù he says, grinning. ‚ÄúHoping to run into anyone?‚Äù

I hate how he knows me, how he always has. I sip again, and suddenly it‚Äôs senior year all over again. There‚Äôs Thomas in his denim vest, patches from every metal band that ever mattered. Always watching, always curious about who I met in this place.

‚ÄúCome on, man. Let me meet him just once,‚Äù he‚Äôd say.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt something I want you part of,‚Äù I‚Äôd tell him, and feel that pinch of guilt.

Thomas knew every crime I‚Äôd committed, every backroom deal. He was always the ride away from trouble. But I couldn‚Äôt let him meet him. Not when my crimes stopped being about survival and started being about favors, power, reputation.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give me that shit,‚Äù he‚Äôd plead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you bleeding, helped patch you up more times than Miss Loveheart could count.‚Äù

And every time, I‚Äôd talk him down, get him to walk away.

Until the one day he didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúCome on, Jamie. Don‚Äôt send your friend off before I get a chance to say hello,‚Äù the tall man said, flicking his Zippo open and shut like punctuation.

He extended his hand to Thomas.

Thomas, like a damn idiot, shook it like he was meeting the president.

‚ÄúHello, mister‚Ä¶ I never caught your name. Jamie never told me.‚Äù

With a grin too wide to be real, the man said, ‚ÄúMy name is Coyote, young man. Now if you‚Äôll excuse us, we have business to discuss.‚Äù He clapped Thomas on the back like a proud uncle.

Back in the caf√©, I‚Äôm holding coffee gone lukewarm.

‚ÄúI was just hoping to find a way into that building,‚Äù I tell Thomas.

‚ÄúJamie‚Ä¶ listen, man. Nobody goes into that place. I mean nobody. Bought in 2013, and it‚Äôs been empty ever since.‚Äù

I nod. Figures.

Thomas fills me in on what I missed. I let him. Feels like something out of a story I half-remember.

Miss Loveheart, our principal, got married two years after I left. Not graduated. Just vanished. Left the school, my family, everything.

Coyote followed, though. Said I made a contract.

In 2012, they found Miss Loveheart and her husband dead. Big grins frozen on their faces. School shut down not long after.

I go to the counter and order two more coffees.

‚ÄúThis is all interesting, Tommy,‚Äù I say, handing him his cup, ‚Äúbut I want to know if anyone had ties to the KKK. Or‚Ä¶ maybe that‚Äôs outdated. Anyone turn skinhead? Start carrying hate in their heart?‚Äù

He blinks. Then leans back.

‚ÄúWell, now that you mention it‚Ä¶ you remember Mr. Snake? History teacher?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Used to lose his shit when no one participated. What about him?‚Äù

‚ÄúStarted hanging with some neo-Nazis. Right after the school shut down. Could be nothing. Could be what you‚Äôre looking for.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I say. Then lower my voice. ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been off the grid up here. Destroyed my lighter. You know anyone I can get some work from?‚Äù

‚ÄúWork that matches your‚Ä¶ talents?‚Äù

I nod. ‚ÄúYeah. Nothing involving magic though. That part of my life‚Äôs done. Something semi-legit.‚Äù

Thomas laughs. ‚ÄúI got just the guy.‚Äù

1m41q3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1m41q3s/always_on_the_outside/,Always on the outside,"In my childhood and high school years I always had amazing very solid friendships. Even in my college years it was easy make friends and find groups that I fit into and felt comfortable and accepted in.

When I started dating my now husband we were long distance. Eventually I moved to be with him. Ever since moving I have had a hard time with friendships. I always feel like I‚Äôm on the outside of every group I‚Äôve hung out with. The last one to get an invite, if I get on at all. The person that is just forgotten. 

I normally don‚Äôt let it get to me because I am a bit of an introvert, but things have become harder for me since having my daughter. She is a little over a year now. There are a couple other moms in my husband and my friend group and I started trying to get to know them all and hang out with them more. I tried to be really intentional. Inviting them to go places or hang out with me and my daughter, helping whenever they needed it, always responding to texts. I felt like it was going good for a while, but always did feel like I was putting in more effort. One of the problems may be that I moved here 7 years ago, while most of them grew up in the area and went to school together. There were a couple times that they would post pictures of them doing outings or play dates together and I would feel a bit sad and left out. 

The other day I reached a breaking point I guess. I texted one of the moms that lived closest to me in the morning and told her I was planning to maybe go either to an indoor play place or a coffee shop near us that had a little playroom for kids and said that I‚Äôd love to hang out if they want to join. She told me that sounded fun and to keep her updated. Later that day I told her that I was going to go to the coffee shop in about an hour. She responded that all the other moms were at her house hanging out right now and that she would maybe check with alll of them to see what they wanted to do.

So I went to the coffee shop and sat there waiting for a response. Time passed and I didn‚Äôt receive any texts back. I do not like to cry in public, but I couldn‚Äôt help but cry a little as I sat there watching my daughter play. I have never felt more alone as a mother, than in that moment. I think if they texted back that they couldn‚Äôt come or even didn‚Äôt want to come it would have been less painful. The silence hurt. I decided to stop trying to initiate stuff for a bit and see if maybe they invite me to something. It‚Äôs been over a month now and I haven‚Äôt received a single texts from any of them. 

I tell my husband that it‚Äôs fine and I don‚Äôt need them, but when I think about that day and the way I felt in that moment I still want to cry. 

I just want time friendships where I am seen and valued, but I just feel so lost right now. ",1,1752945706.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

\
(Worthy Satire) - What began as a routine transatlantic flight turned into a bizarre survival scenario when a Delta Airlines plane was forced to make an emergency landing on a remote island in the Azores. The passengers, stuck on the tarmac and later on the island for over 24 hours, faced a surreal twist: the in-flight entertainment system remained frozen on the TV series LOST ‚Äî the irony not lost on anyone.\
\
‚ÄúWe thought it was just a rough patch of turbulence,‚Äù said one passenger. ‚ÄúThen the engine sputtered, the captain said we were diverting to an island, and suddenly every screen on the plane started playing scenes of people crashing and foraging in the jungle. Not exactly reassuring.‚Äù\
\
As hours passed with limited communication from Delta and diminishing snack supplies, survival instincts began to emerge. Passengers started organizing into task groups ‚Äî one for food inventory, one for scouting restroom access, and another for ‚Äúkeeping morale from collapsing into full-blown panic.‚Äù\
\
Flight attendants, who remained calm and professional, attempted to downplay the situation, offering lukewarm coffee and explaining that a relief flight was ""definitely probably on the way."" Meanwhile, one man tried to fashion a fishing rod out of a seatbelt extender and a stir stick. Others debated rationing biscotti.\
\
‚ÄúWatching LOST on repeat while being literally lost is... psychologically complex,‚Äù noted another traveler. ‚ÄúAt one point, I caught myself wondering if the island wanted us here.‚Äù\
\
A Delta spokesperson issued a statement saying they were working quickly to get the passengers home and added that the looped entertainment was ""an unfortunate coincidence,"" though passengers suspected otherwise. By hour 20, some had stopped watching and started taking notes ‚Äî ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù\
\
All passengers are safe, and the relief plane is expected to arrive ‚Äúshortly.‚Äù Until then, they remain stuck between a malfunctioning jet and a psychologically haunting television marathon ‚Äî wondering what‚Äôs real, and whether there‚Äôs any more ginger ale.\

1m41ph3,https://www.reddit.com/r/existential/comments/1m41ph3/existential_crisis_im_drowning_in_pessimism_and/,Existential crisis: I'm drowning in pessimism and nihilism. (hopefully this can bring peace),"
(MODS I HOPE THIS IS NOT TOO LONG ü´Çüå∏ü¶ãüíï)

From my own experience swimming in deep waters: 

There is the potential to drown in pessimism and nihilism because we can't avoid the ugly truth.

so, how do I deal with the fallout of this hopelessness
when I engage with the such negativity? I feel like I'm going to war every time I look for answers and discover nothing but negativity. where is the hope? everything tells me how to stay in it but I want to get out of it!
----
I must set my mind to observe, dissociated (not disassociated :) from the  enemy. if I'm not detached, I can lose that battle and become weary and hopeless. 

however the experience of that loss can be turned around if I know how to take that pain and turn it away from myself and towards the real threat. that pain was a weapon against me, but it's mine now.. I will use it to understand my enemy and use it against it. 

all that pain and confusion I can now leverage it. I need to learn how to become a thief, and a warrior, and a liar and a cheater so that I know how my enemy thinks. Because I'm not going to lie and cheat and steal from people, no, I'm going to do all of these things to my enemy but I have to know what I'm dealing with and I can't be a good person to do this. That's why everybody tells you to lead with love however they lead with murder. Do you see? they want you to be a good person and without tools to defend yourself against them.

We can't go through this life not knowing our enemy, so here's how it operates to consume us..

THERE ARE TWO ENEMIES:
one enemy is our friend, and the other enemy is the collective nihilism of our age. 

it is the collective thoughts of everyone's septic state of mind. every time someone has a ""bad"" thought or a ""bad"" feeling, they say ""I'm a Christian"" I can't think that way, or ""I'm a light being"" I have to feel good, not bad.. instead of dealing with that negativity (that I created), I rip it out and I throw it away, but it has to go somewhere. 

8 billion people rip negativity out of themselves and ""throw it away"" 10x a day or more - the bad thoughts of people in denial (not those of us trying to figure this out) has collected together in a thought form that crushes us and that is why we feel the way we feel all the time, for some reason or for no reason at all.

SORRY, THE TWO ENEMIES: 
:) 
The enemy that threw me into existential crisis after existential crisis/the one that makes me uncomfortable with staying put is my friend. some people called this enemy the dark night of the soul.

The other enemy is this thought form of 8 billion people, which is why it feels crushing. i'm desperate to find answers and it leverages my curiosity to bury me in pessimism and hopelessness in order to stagnate and decay.

I came to understood this to help me stay balanced in existential crisis:

my friend enemy is there to push me out of harms way and back out to the deep, where it is safe. it seems like it's trying to kill me, and it kind of is, but it's doing it for me because - it is me...

when I stop labeling the world as bad evil and dangerous, my friend enemy becomes just my friend. I understand that there isn't anything evil, that there isn't anything bad, that there isn't anything dangerous, so I 
Get rid of that injured thinking, I get rid of all the rules, I get rid of being obedient to everything I've been taught and I wiped the slight clean, and began listening to myself. 

I allow my conscious awareness to merge with my subconscious and become whole. my subconscious is my instinct, it knows what to do if I just listen to it. once we develop a relationship with one another, it will protect me from all of this confusion and fear and lack of direction, because it is my compass.

when I don't trust myself and my instinct, I sabotage myself. so while I think IT is my enemy, I am actually its enemy. 
it is telling me an absurd notion to do, and I want to do it, but I ignore it and listen to what sounds logical instead, because I don't wanna look like an idiot. however my subconscious absurdity is the way out of this logical linear prison that is making me miserable. no one needs to know anything, I need to do everything in private anyway. what everyone told me to think say and do got me into this mess, so I stopped listening.

When I assigned something as wrong, it doesn't make it wrong, it makes it my enemy. 

Red hair is wrong, it is now my enemy. Swearing is wrong, it is now my enemy. 

I like red hair, it is now my friend. I love to swear, it is now my friend. 

When I remove all of the labels and categories and boxes, I turn my gaze off of fighting against my made up enemies and I can now put my energy on the real fight. I was fighting a fight the red hair was wrong this whole time, but I changed it by changing out would think about it. 

I freed myself and realize I've been in the wrong fight this whole time against myself and my perceived red haired enemies, and I spend years deconstructing all of what I constructed. 

when I'm done with that, now I get to see what is true, and what is standing before me that is keeping me from where I wanna go.

my life is like an island hop in the middle of nowhere, and each island holds provisions for a certain amount of time, and if I get scared or hopeless and stay there too long, I'm going to starve and dehydrate and die. so my instinct pushes me back out into the deep to find another island. or to use relatable terminology, it pushes me into another dark night of the soul.

now, the real opponent's goal is to do whatever it takes to get me to stay on that one island - where I starve and dehydrate and die. it is insidious. but I've stopped fighting myself and I've turned towards it and I see it for what it is, it's not really a threat anymore, but I've got to stay vigilant, because the real opponent is simply an idea.

Think about the ideas that pop into your head and keep you from what you really wanna do, this is the real opponent, you just have to get over the idea. 

and it is a stupid nothing idea trying to hold you back. when you allow yourself to face your fears, when you allow yourself to imagine the unimaginable, it's the only way to illuminate everything.

fears... 
-you can't say that
-You can't do that
-You can't think that way
-Your imagination is your enemy, it's maladaptive
-you can't behave that way

actually, I can do anything I want, and I will. 

we keep asking ourselves am I? am I good enough? Am I successful? Am I this, am I that? that's what this world has to offer, doubt, period.

now this world is conditional so you have to use my imagination to do all of this work. This world will not let me, so I created my own world where I can and I will. This is true manifesting, because once I have created my world where I have 378 billion dollars in my account, I CAN and I will. 

it will print out into this world eventually, but I have to learn how to do it properly before it prints out and it evolves. I have to understand that my imagination is where I learn all of lessons and solve all of my problems. not here in the world, they are in my imagination. 

there I'm an assassin, a geneticist, a mom, a friend, a sister, anything I want to be. I have lived over 1000 years in my narrative and I have millions of timelines I jump to when I'm bored with one I go to another one and I start a new one. and then when I'm ready I'll go back to the ones that I created and I'll continue my narrative. and the only thing that is allowed in this world is infinite possibilities and abundance. 

this world is where I go to do the unimaginable (get relief) so that I can decide how I feel about it. I already know how everybody else feels about it they can't shut up about what they think. 

This world that I created is mine and no one else's. this imaginary world is where my choice comes into play in the real world.

how I feel about what exists and if I want to do it or not is how the real world comes into play. To be or not to be, that is the question. but I don't know if I want to be or not to be if I haven't imagined it beforehand.

free will is attached to my subconscious/imagination, not my conscious awareness. my conscious awareness is 5% my subconscious is 95%, so I can end self sabotage once I stop fighting against myself in the real world and move to my imagination where I can figure it out like a puzzle.

Choice.. how I choose is everything (not what). choose btw a candy bar and a steak. 

The candy bar and the steak are the same thing, it's a distraction from the real choice.

my belief that I create in my imagination is the (how) that determines everything. it isn't whether I choose a candy bar or a steak, it's what I believe about the choice that is put before me. If I believe I can only choose a candy bar or a steak then I'm lost. There are infinite choices in front of me, but the candy bar and the steak is the distraction, because I've been programmed to believe that all of that exist is the candy bar in the steak.

organic or not, it's all the same.. if I believe that eating dog shit out of the yards of other people is nourishing my body, then it will. But I have to be 100% on the same page with my belief for this to work, which is why manifesting didn't work at first. I was a divided mind. 

to each his own.. this a fingerprint, bespoke, and I have to be 100% committed to it in order for it to work. I can't let the doubts infect my project, which is why I have to learn to fight the real enemy properly. 

how I arrive at the choices I make is everything. I need to forge my own codes of conduct.

all of this is being said so that I can find my way back to myself and understand what's happening, because any answer I hoped to find in this world (book, web page, even beautiful philosophy) is propaganda.. however philosophy was there to slingshot me into ""the further"" which is my subconscious/imagination/polarity/childhood. my childhood represents what could have been and what can still be.

this life is for the dreamers. If I cannot dream and imagine my own way out, the way out is hidden from me. This world is calling our imagination maladaptive and it's simply not true. not only is it not true it, is the path to death. 

I do everything in private. I don't answer to anyone but myself, but until I could establish that and be strong, I need to do this without outside interference. I was awake out in the open, but my true life (my encrypted inner life which is secret and nobody can touch and fuck with) was being created and nobody could interfere because they didn't know about it. 

it needs to be protected from categories boxes and labels such as a diagnosis of maladaptive daydreaming. i'm not here to conform to the world the world needs to conform to me.

Everything in this world is propaganda and is unencrypted. my true nature is encrypted. my real life is encrypted.

even people like me, when we get this far, we sound bitter and pessimistic because this world is found to be so grotesque. all of us who know what we're talking about have forged warrior and have now become samurai. we shed a lot of blood and have killed ourselves over and over to get where we are. we've had to destroy our own narratives thousands of times and once we did, we saw the world - a giant battlefield covered in the innocence of red. we see all of the unnecessary violence of this world and we hate it.

we are on the same page with ourselves, so we are not under any illusion that we need to be a good person. we are are neither good nor bad, we are necessary. our hearts and imaginations are stunning, tho.

and our hearts and imaginations are encrypted, so others don't really get to see that part of us. they see the unencrypted part which appears to them as being a complete asshole ü§≠, but because of this delusion rainbow coffee world, we will always be seen as the villain.

1m41pgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Venturex/comments/1m41pgk/venture_x_positive_experience_over_2_week_trip/,Venture X Positive Experience over 2 week trip across Europe,"Summary: I took a two week trip across Europe (Paris, Geneva, Lucerne, Lugano/Como) with the Venture X card and booking through the portal. I had with 0 issues with the card during the trip and bookings. Saved $1100 with price matches and cash back.

What was nice and handy was having all my bookings through the portal. Then they're basically guaranteeing me the best price on every booking and at least 5-10% back on every booking. I feel like you can't go wrong using the portal with this approach or the card in general. It's a deal that feels so good, that it could go away, so use it while you can.

First I booked the flights through the portal with United. 5x miles was $120 in cashback. Once I booked the flight the confirmation showed up on the United App, nearly immediately. No issues here; very simple. Their partner KLM did lose our bags on the way home though. Still not sure where they're at, but it's only been 24h.

I booked 4 hotels and one rental car through the portal. I did quite a bit of research finding decently priced hotels online through various websites and google searches, then confirmed capital one had them on the portal, booked on the portal and price matched, which only took a few minutes. I had $734 in price match savings alone. Each time capital one applied the credits, I carried them over to the next booking. Avg. nightly rate in peak season was $169, so I thought I did pretty well here. One hotel in Lugano blew us away with a view and free breakfast (best bfast I've ever had period). Honestly, every stay was super nice and each surprised us.

I was reading horror stories on Reddit about bookings not occurring, but I think that could be negative propaganda. I did my diligence and reached out to each hotel and they all responded promptly confirming the booking. 

I then applied for preferred status with the rental car companies. I ended up finding the cheapest price through Avis via a random site on Kayak, could of been Europcar, but I forget. The Avis status upgrade only took a day or so and I couldn't get it to show up on the Avis website on my booking, but when I showed up to Avis they upgraded me, as research showed they would, if an upgrade was available. Price match through the portal with Avis was $277 and cash back was $51.

Granted I could have found some savings booking direct or booking on hotels dot com, like I usually do. But even then, I could find better prices than Expedia or Hotels dot com on the most random websites I've never heard of. And capital one matched them all, which made me curious how they can do this, unless they go out to these websites and actually book them for you. 

Before I left the country, I also signed up for their checking account and got their debit card, which was a $200 bonus iirc. I did this, just so I could save on ATM fees with their network. However, I didn't even need cash in Europe the entire time, minus one coffee shop in Colmar, France that only accepted cash let me leave saying it's no big deal and I asked for an ATM nearby, which cost $7 to use, but hey it did work. I was quite happy with not having to carry Euros and Francs around.

Overall it was a great trip and Capital One was a great partner throughout it. And I highly recommend Switzerland if you can afford to go. With some due diligence and research, it wasn't awfully expensive. Their infrastructure blew me away. There was not one crack or pothole on any road we drove on. There's basically no advertising anywhere to be found, which allows you to focus on the beauty of your surroundings in the cities or countryside and of course the road. The cities are so clean too. It's clear each person is proud of where they live and everything is well taken care of. Almost everyone has some kind of shrubbery or flowers too, making any city/village or home look beautiful.

# Best Paper Tea Cups 2025: Find Your Perfect Cup!

Paper tea cups have evolved considerably from simple disposable vessels. Today's market offers a wide array of options, catering to diverse needs and preferences. Whether you're hosting a large event, seeking a convenient on-the-go solution, or prioritizing eco-friendliness, finding the right paper tea cup can enhance your tea-drinking experience. This guide explores the best paper tea cups expected to dominate in 2025, considering factors such as durability, insulation, environmental impact, and aesthetic appeal. Choosing the right cup depends on individual requirements and priorities, so we‚Äôll delve into the features and benefits of top contenders to help you make an informed decision.

## Key Features Analysis

The landscape of paper tea cups is diverse, with innovations focusing on enhancing both functionality and sustainability.

**Insulation Technology:** Insulation is a critical feature that determines how well a tea cup maintains the temperature of its contents. Many top-tier paper tea cups now incorporate double-wall or even triple-wall construction, creating an air gap that minimizes heat transfer. Some manufacturers are experimenting with vacuum-insulated paper cups, mirroring the technology used in stainless steel thermoses. These advanced designs offer superior heat retention,keeping your tea hot for extended periods without burning your hands. This feature is measured by the temperature drop per hour, and leading models demonstrate less than a 10-degree Fahrenheit decrease over a two-hour period.

**Material Composition:** The materials used in paper tea cups significantly impact their durability, biodegradability, and taste neutrality. High-quality cups utilize thick, multi-layered paperboard, often coated with plant-based linings like PLA (polylactic acid) instead of conventional plastic. Innovations include cups made from recycled fibers,sugarcane pulp (bagasse),and bamboo,offering sustainable alternatives to virgin paper. The thickness and density of the paper directly correlate with its ability to withstand hot liquids without leaking or becoming soggy, with premium cups typically boasting a paperboard weight of 300gsm (grams per square meter) or higher.

**Leak-Proof Design:** Reliability is paramount, and a leak-proof design is a non-negotiable feature for any reputable paper tea cup. Modern cups employ advanced sealing techniques, such as tightly rolled rims and proprietary coating formulations, to prevent seepage and spills. Rigorous testing ensures that these cups can withstand prolonged exposure to hot liquids without compromising their structural integrity. The best cups undergo pressure tests and tilting trials to guarantee leak-proof performance even under stressful conditions.Certain designs add an inner lining to prevent any potential leaks.

**Eco-Friendliness:** With increasing environmental awareness, eco-friendliness has become a key consideration for consumers. Sustainable paper tea cups utilize recycled content,biodegradable materials,and compostable linings,minimizing their environmental footprint. Manufacturers are also focusing on reducing waste during the production process and optimizing cup designs to minimize material usage. Certifications like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Biodegradable Products Institute (BPI) provide assurance of a cup's environmental credentials. A focus on reducing plastic usage has become paramount for eco-conscious consumers.

**Lid Compatibility and Design:** A well-designed lid is crucial for preventing spills and maintaining the temperature of the tea. High-quality lids are made from the same sustainable materials as the cups,ensuring consistent biodegradability or compostability. They feature a secure fit, preventing accidental detachment, and often incorporate a drinking spout for convenient sipping. Design innovations include lids with built-in filters for loose-leaf tea and resealable openings for added convenience and spill protection.The lids also contribute to temperature consistency.

## Core Benefits

Using high quality paper tea cups brings a number of advantages for both consumers and event organizers.**Enhanced Convenience:** Paper tea cups offer unparalleled convenience compared to traditional ceramic or glass alternatives. Their disposability eliminates the need for washing and storing, making them ideal for large gatherings, outdoor events, and on-the-go consumption. This convenience saves time and effort, allowing hosts and attendees to focus on enjoying the event rather than worrying about cleanup. For busy individuals, having a readily available disposable cup simplifies the tea-drinking routine.

**Improved Hygiene:** In settings where hygiene is a top priority, such as hospitals, schools, and public events, disposable paper tea cups provide a safer and more sanitary option than reusable cups. They eliminate the risk of cross-contamination and reduce the spread of germs, promoting a healthier surroundings. Single-use cups ensure that each user has a clean and uncontaminated vessel, minimizing the potential for illness. This is especially critically important in situations where handwashing facilities are limited.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** For large-scale events and businesses that serve tea regularly, paper tea cups can be a more cost-effective solution than purchasing and maintaining reusable cups.The initial investment in paper cups is significantly lower, and there are no associated costs for washing, drying, or replacing broken or damaged cups. While the per-cup cost may be higher than washing a reusable cup, the overall savings on labor and resources can be substantial. Bulk purchases of paper cups further reduce the cost per unit.**Environmental Duty:** Choosing eco-friendly paper tea cups demonstrates a commitment to environmental responsibility. By selecting cups made from recycled content, biodegradable materials, and compostable linings, consumers can minimize their impact on the planet. These sustainable options help reduce landfill waste, conserve natural resources, and promote a circular economy. Supporting manufacturers that prioritize environmental stewardship encourages further innovation in sustainable packaging solutions. The eco-friendly nature of these cups are a bonus for environmentally conscious people.

**versatility and Customization:** Paper tea cups are remarkably versatile and can be used for a wide range of hot and cold beverages, not just tea. they are also easily customizable with logos, designs, and branding, making them ideal for promotional events and corporate functions. This versatility allows businesses to tailor their beverage service to specific needs and occasions. Customized cups enhance brand visibility and create a professional impression. This opens up new avenues for advertisement as well.

## FAQs section

Addressing some frequently asked questions about paper tea cups can definitely help clarify their suitability for various applications.

**Are paper tea cups really heat-resistant?**
Yes, high-quality paper tea cups are designed to withstand high temperatures without leaking or becoming structurally compromised.They are typically lined with a heat-resistant material, such as PLA or polyethylene, which prevents the liquid from penetrating the paper. The double-wall or triple-wall construction of some cups also provides added insulation and prevents the cup from becoming too hot to hold. These cups can safely hold boiling water without issues.**Can paper tea cups be recycled?**
The recyclability of paper tea cups depends on the coatings and materials used in their construction.Cups lined with polyethylene are generally not recyclable in most facilities due to the difficulty of separating the plastic lining from the paper. However,cups lined with PLA or other compostable materials can be composted in industrial composting facilities.Cups made from recycled paper are also a good option,as they reduce the demand for virgin paper. Individual municipalities also have different recycling rules.

**Are paper tea cups safe to drink from?**
Yes, provided they are made from food-grade materials and do not contain harmful chemicals.Reputable manufacturers adhere to strict quality control standards and use materials that are safe for contact with food and beverages. Look for cups that are certified by organizations like the FDA or the European Food Safety Authority. These certifications ensure that the cups have been tested for lead, phthalates, and other harmful substances. they are safe for consumption.

**How long can a paper tea cup hold hot tea without leaking?**
The duration depends on the quality of the cup and the temperature of the liquid. A well-made, high-quality cup should be able to hold hot tea for at least 30 minutes to an hour without leaking. Cups with double-wall or triple-wall construction will typically provide better insulation and leak resistance. Though, extremely hot liquids may degrade the lining of the cup over time, so it‚Äôs best to consume the tea within a reasonable timeframe. Temperature greatly affects this feature.

Hey there,

I‚Äôm a 33-year-old guy from Southeast Michigan (Thumb area), and I‚Äôm looking to meet a woman who‚Äôs down for an easygoing, fun, and real connection‚Äîno pressure, no drama, just good energy and honest vibes.

A little about me:
By day, I‚Äôm living the hybrid work life‚Äîflexible schedule, weird hours, and plenty of time to sneak away for a coffee, a hike, or an impromptu road trip. Weeknights, I‚Äôm all about keeping it low-key: trash TV, sports, a good book, or zoning out with a drink after a long day.


But weekends? That‚Äôs when I thrive. I‚Äôm big on anything outdoors‚Äîcamping, kayaking, beachcombing, breweries, hiking, biking, getting lost somewhere scenic. I like being active, but I‚Äôm not out here trying to climb Everest. It‚Äôs more about soaking up the good weather and good company.

Vibes & personality:
Think laid-back with a sarcastic edge. I‚Äôm the kind of guy who can have you cracking up one minute and getting deep the next. I‚Äôm loyal, touchy-feely (in a good way), and I genuinely enjoy getting to know people. My love language is physical touch and witty banter‚Äîso if you like to tease, flirt, and dish it right back, we‚Äôll get along just fine.

Physically:
5'10"", green eyes, brown hair, athletic build. No smoking, no drugs, social drinker, and disease-free. I keep myself in good shape and appreciate someone who takes care of themselves, but perfection isn‚Äôt the goal‚Äîauthenticity is.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
A woman who‚Äôs confident, kind, and doesn‚Äôt take life (or herself) too seriously. Curvy? Outdoorsy? A little sarcastic or delightfully weird? Total win. I‚Äôm not looking to collect chats or ghost people‚ÄîI‚Äôd rather have one or two solid, ongoing connections with someone who‚Äôs down for both fun and depth. We can start flirty and playful and just see where things go.

This isn‚Äôt a mass casting call‚Äîjust one real connection that feels good, whether it‚Äôs daily texts, venting after work, sharing memes, or planning to meet up.

If you made it this far, shoot me a message that tells me a little more than ‚Äúhey.‚Äù What‚Äôs your perfect lazy Sunday? What show do you secretly binge when no one‚Äôs watching? Or just throw a sarcastic one-liner at me‚ÄîI‚Äôll throw one back.

Let‚Äôs keep it light, honest, and fun‚Äîand if something more grows from it, even better.

From my own experience swimming in deep waters: 

There is the potential to drown in pessimism and nihilism because we can't avoid the ugly truth.

so, how do I deal with the fallout of this hopelessness
when I engage with the such negativity? I feel like I'm going to war every time I look for answers and discover nothing but negativity. where is the hope? everything tells me how to stay in it but I want to get out of it!
----
I must set my mind to observe, dissociated (not disassociated :) from the  enemy. if I'm not detached, I can lose that battle and become weary and hopeless. 

however the experience of that loss can be turned around if I know how to take that pain and turn it away from myself and towards the real threat. that pain was a weapon against me, but it's mine now.. I will use it to understand my enemy and use it against it. 

all that pain and confusion I can now leverage it. I need to learn how to become a thief, and a warrior, and a liar and a cheater so that I know how my enemy thinks. Because I'm not going to lie and cheat and steal from people, no, I'm going to do all of these things to my enemy but I have to know what I'm dealing with and I can't be a good person to do this. That's why everybody tells you to lead with love however they lead with murder. Do you see? they want you to be a good person and without tools to defend yourself against them.

We can't go through this life not knowing our enemy, so here's how it operates to consume us..

THERE ARE TWO ENEMIES:
one enemy is our friend, and the other enemy is the collective nihilism of our age. 

it is the collective thoughts of everyone's septic state of mind. every time someone has a ""bad"" thought or a ""bad"" feeling, they say ""I'm a Christian"" I can't think that way, or ""I'm a light being"" I have to feel good, not bad.. instead of dealing with that negativity (that I created), I rip it out and I throw it away, but it has to go somewhere. 

8 billion people rip negativity out of themselves and ""throw it away"" 10x a day or more - the bad thoughts of people in denial (not those of us trying to figure this out) has collected together in a thought form that crushes us and that is why we feel the way we feel all the time, for some reason or for no reason at all.

SORRY, THE TWO ENEMIES: 
:) 
The enemy that threw me into existential crisis after existential crisis/the one that makes me uncomfortable with staying put is my friend. some people called this enemy the dark night of the soul.

The other enemy is this thought form of 8 billion people, which is why it feels crushing. i'm desperate to find answers and it leverages my curiosity to bury me in pessimism and hopelessness in order to stagnate and decay.

I came to understood this to help me stay balanced in existential crisis:

my friend enemy is there to push me out of harms way and back out to the deep, where it is safe. it seems like it's trying to kill me, and it kind of is, but it's doing it for me because - it is me...

when I stop labeling the world as bad evil and dangerous, my friend enemy becomes just my friend. I understand that there isn't anything evil, that there isn't anything bad, that there isn't anything dangerous, so I 
Get rid of that injured thinking, I get rid of all the rules, I get rid of being obedient to everything I've been taught and I wiped the slight clean, and began listening to myself. 

I allow my conscious awareness to merge with my subconscious and become whole. my subconscious is my instinct, it knows what to do if I just listen to it. once we develop a relationship with one another, it will protect me from all of this confusion and fear and lack of direction, because it is my compass.

when I don't trust myself and my instinct and I sabotage myself. so while I think IT is my enemy, I am actually its enemy. 
it is telling me an absurd notion to do, and I want to do it, but I ignore it and listen to what sounds logical instead, because I don't wanna look like an idiot. however my subconscious absurdity is the way out of this logical linear prison that is making me miserable. no one needs to know anything, I need to do everything in private anyway. what everyone told us to think say and do got us into this mess, I've gotta stop listening to it.

When I assigned something as wrong, it doesn't make it wrong, it makes it my enemy. 

Red hair is wrong, it is now my enemy. Swearing is wrong, it is now my enemy. 

I like red hair, it is now my friend. I love to swear, it is now my friend. 

When I remove all of the labels and categories and boxes, I turn my gaze off of fighting against my made up enemies and I can now put my energy on the real fight. I was fighting a fight the red hair was wrong this whole time, but I changed it by changing out would think about it. 

I freed myself and realize I've been in the wrong fight this whole time against myself and my perceived red haired enemies, and I spend years deconstructing all of what I constructed. 

when I'm done with that, now I get to see what is true, and what is standing before me that is keeping me from where I wanna go.

my life is like an island hop in the middle of nowhere, and each island holds provisions for a certain amount of time, and if I get scared or hopeless and stay there too long, I'm going to starve and dehydrate and die. so my instinct pushes me back out into the deep to find another island. or to use relatable terminology, it pushes me into another dark night of the soul.

now, the real opponent's goal is to do whatever it takes to get me to stay on that one island - where I starve and dehydrate and die. it is insidious. but I've stopped fighting myself and I've turned towards it and I see it for what it is, it's not really a threat anymore, but I've got to stay vigilant, because the real opponent is simply an idea.

Think about the ideas that pop into your head and keep you from what you really wanna do, this is the real opponent, you just have to get over the idea. 

and it is a stupid nothing idea trying to hold you back. when you allow yourself to face your fears, when you allow yourself to imagine the unimaginable, it's the only way to illuminate everything.

fears... 
-you can't say that
-You can't do that
-You can't think that way
-Your imagination is your enemy, it's maladaptive
-you can't behave that way

actually, I can do anything I want, and I will. 

we keep asking ourselves am I? am I good enough? Am I successful? Am I this, am I that? that's what this world has to offer, doubt, period.

now this world is conditional so you have to use my imagination to do all of this work. This world will not let me, so I created my own world where I can and I will. This is true manifesting, because once I have created my world where I have 378 billion dollars in my account, I CAN and I will. 

it will print out into this world eventually, but I have to learn how to do it properly before it prints out and it evolves. I have to understand that my imagination is where I learn all of lessons and solve all of my problems. not here in the world, they are in my imagination. 

there I'm an assassin, a geneticist, a mom, a friend, a sister, anything I want to be. I have lived over 1000 years in my narrative and I have millions of timelines I jump to when I'm bored with one I go to another one and I start a new one. and then when I'm ready I'll go back to the ones that I created and I'll continue my narrative. and the only thing that is allowed in this world is infinite possibilities and abundance. 

this world is where I go to do the unimaginable (get relief) so that I can decide how I feel about it. I already know how everybody else feels about it they can't shut up about what they think. 

This world that I created is mine and no one else's. this imaginary world is where my choice comes into play in the real world.

how I feel about what exists and if I want to do it or not is how the real world comes into play. To be or not to be, that is the question. but I don't know if I want to be or not to be if I haven't imagined it beforehand.

free will is attached to my subconscious/imagination, not my conscious awareness. my conscious awareness is 5% my subconscious is 95%, so I can end self sabotage once I stop fighting against myself in the real world and move to my imagination where I can figure it out like a puzzle.

Choice.. how I choose is everything (not what). choose btw a candy bar and a steak. 

The candy bar and the steak are the same thing, it's a distraction from the real choice.

my belief that I create in my imagination is the (how) that determines everything. it isn't whether I choose a candy bar or a steak, it's what I believe about the choice that is put before me. If I believe I can only choose a candy bar or a steak then I'm lost. There are infinite choices in front of me, but the candy bar and the steak is the distraction, because I've been programmed to believe that all of that exist is the candy bar in the steak.

organic or not, it's all the same.. if I believe that eating dog shit out of the yards of other people is nourishing my body, then it will. But I have to be 100% on the same page with my belief for this to work, which is why manifesting didn't work at first. I was a divided mind. 

to each his own.. this a fingerprint, bespoke, and I have to be 100% committed to it in order for it to work. I can't let the doubts infect my project, which is why I have to learn to fight the real enemy properly. 

how I arrive at the choices I make is everything. I need to forge my own codes of conduct.

all of this is being said so that I can find my way back to myself and understand what's happening, because any answer I hoped to find in this world (book, web page, even beautiful philosophy) is propaganda.. however philosophy was there to slingshot me into ""the further"" which is my subconscious/imagination/polarity/childhood. my childhood represents what could have been and what can still be.

this life is for the dreamers. If I cannot dream and imagine my own way out, the way out is hidden from me. This world is calling our imagination maladaptive and it's simply not true. not only is it not true it, is the path to death. 

I do everything in private. I don't answer to anyone but myself, but until I could establish that and be strong, I need to do this without outside interference. I was awake out in the open, but my true life (my encrypted inner life which is secret and nobody can touch and fuck with) was being created and nobody could interfere because they didn't know about it. 

it needs to be protected from categories boxes and labels such as a diagnosis of maladaptive daydreaming. i'm not here to conform to the world the world needs to conform to me.

Everything in this world is propaganda and is unencrypted. my true nature is encrypted. my real life is encrypted.

even people like me, when we get this far, we sound bitter and pessimistic because this world is found to be so grotesque. all of us who know what we're talking about have forged warrior and have now become samurai. we shed a lot of blood and have killed ourselves over and over to get where we are. we've had to destroy our own narratives thousands of times and once we did, we saw the world - a giant battlefield covered in the innocence of red. we see all of the unnecessary violence of this world and we hate it.

we are on the same page with ourselves, so we are not under any illusion that we need to be a good person. we are are neither good nor bad, we are necessary. our hearts and imaginations are stunning, tho.

and our hearts and imaginations are encrypted, so others don't really get to see that part of us. they see the unencrypted part which appears to them as being a complete asshole ü§≠, but because of this delusion rainbow coffee world, we will always be seen as the villain.

Hey there,

I‚Äôm a 33-year-old guy from Southeast Michigan (Thumb area), and I‚Äôm looking to meet a woman who‚Äôs down for an easygoing, fun, and real connection‚Äîno pressure, no drama, just good energy and honest vibes.

A little about me:
By day, I‚Äôm living the hybrid work life‚Äîflexible schedule, weird hours, and plenty of time to sneak away for a coffee, a hike, or an impromptu road trip. Weeknights, I‚Äôm all about keeping it low-key: trash TV, sports, a good book, or zoning out with a drink after a long day.


But weekends? That‚Äôs when I thrive. I‚Äôm big on anything outdoors‚Äîcamping, kayaking, beachcombing, breweries, hiking, biking, getting lost somewhere scenic. I like being active, but I‚Äôm not out here trying to climb Everest. It‚Äôs more about soaking up the good weather and good company.

Vibes & personality:
Think laid-back with a sarcastic edge. I‚Äôm the kind of guy who can have you cracking up one minute and getting deep the next. I‚Äôm loyal, touchy-feely (in a good way), and I genuinely enjoy getting to know people. My love language is physical touch and witty banter‚Äîso if you like to tease, flirt, and dish it right back, we‚Äôll get along just fine.

Physically:
5'10"", green eyes, brown hair, athletic build. No smoking, no drugs, social drinker, and disease-free. I keep myself in good shape and appreciate someone who takes care of themselves, but perfection isn‚Äôt the goal‚Äîauthenticity is.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
A woman who‚Äôs confident, kind, and doesn‚Äôt take life (or herself) too seriously. Curvy? Outdoorsy? A little sarcastic or delightfully weird? Total win. I‚Äôm not looking to collect chats or ghost people‚ÄîI‚Äôd rather have one or two solid, ongoing connections with someone who‚Äôs down for both fun and depth. We can start flirty and playful and just see where things go.

This isn‚Äôt a mass casting call‚Äîjust one real connection that feels good, whether it‚Äôs daily texts, venting after work, sharing memes, or planning to meet up.

If you made it this far, shoot me a message that tells me a little more than ‚Äúhey.‚Äù What‚Äôs your perfect lazy Sunday? What show do you secretly binge when no one‚Äôs watching? Or just throw a sarcastic one-liner at me‚ÄîI‚Äôll throw one back.

Let‚Äôs keep it light, honest, and fun‚Äîand if something more grows from it, even better.

I'm (36F) from the Netherlands and I'll be traveling solo through Scotland end of October. I'll be using public transport, staying in private rooms (no dorms/hostels). I'm planning on having a good mixture of nature, local hidden gems, and culture. I'd like to avoid the major tourist crowds where possible. As a (female) solo traveller I'd like to stay safe as much as possible. 

I prefer colder weather and used to rain. I walk quite regularly here in the Netherlands, but since it's all flat here, I wouldn't call myself a real hiker. I'm especially interested in scenic walks that are easily accessible from where I'm staying or reachable by public transport.

I love your suggestions for:
- Budget friendly stays (preferably private rooms)
- Scenic, safe and not too touristy places
- Samhain festivities
- Vegetarian friendly food/coffee spots
- Anything you think is worth mentioning 


This is my rough itinerary:
- Day 1-3: arriving in the morning, Glasgow
- Day 3-4: Oban 
- Day 4-5: Fort Williams
- Day 5-7: Inverness
- Day 7-9: Edinburgh (I've visited before, so just enjoying the city), returning back home in the evening.

Thanks so much in advance!

## Key Features Analysis

The overall quality and performance of an 8-ounce candle depend greatly on its specific features. Here, we break down those core elements.

**Wax Type:** The type of wax used substantially impacts a candle's burn, scent throw, and environmental impact. Soy wax,derived from soybeans,is a popular choice due to its clean burn and renewable nature. Paraffin wax, a petroleum byproduct, offers a strong scent throw and is often more economical. Coconut wax, a relatively newer option, boasts a slow burn and remarkable scent diffusion, though it tends to be pricier.

**Fragrance Load:** Fragrance load refers to the percentage of fragrance oil incorporated into the wax. A higher fragrance load often results in a stronger scent throw, filling a room more effectively. However, too much fragrance can lead to an uneven burn, soot production, or even a headache-inducing aroma. The ideal fragrance load strikes a balance between potency and pleasantness, typically ranging from 6% to 10% for most waxes.

**Wick Material:** The wick plays a crucial role in drawing melted wax up to fuel the flame. Cotton wicks are a standard choice, offering a reliable and consistent burn. Wood wicks, gaining popularity for their crackling sound and aesthetic appeal, can provide a slower burn and wider scent distribution. The size and type of wick must be appropriately matched to the candle's diameter and wax type to ensure even melting and prevent tunneling.

**Vessel Material & Design:** The vessel containing the wax significantly impacts both the durability and the aesthetic appeal of the candle. Glass jars are a classic option, allowing the candle's glow to shine through and offering heat resistance.Ceramic containers provide a more refined look and can often be repurposed after the candle is finished. The design and color of the vessel shoudl complement the candle's fragrance and your personal style.

**Burn Time:** The burn time of an 8-ounce candle is a key indicator of its overall value. Generally, an 8-ounce candle should burn for approximately 40 to 50 hours, depending on the wax type, fragrance load, and wick size. Factors such as drafts and improper trimming can affect burn time.A longer burn time translates to more enjoyment and a lower cost per hour.

**scent Complexity & Longevity:** A well-crafted fragrance should have layers, evolving over time as the candle burns. Top notes are the initial scents you perceive, followed by middle notes that form the heart of the fragrance, and base notes that linger in the air. High-quality fragrance oils should provide a consistent and long-lasting scent experience, without fading or becoming artificial over the candle's lifespan.

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right 8-ounce candle offers several notable benefits that enhance your daily life.

**Enhanced Ambiance:** Lighting an 8-ounce candle can instantly transform the atmosphere of a room, creating a warm and inviting ambiance. The soft glow and pleasing fragrance can help to relax after a long day, set the mood for a romantic evening, or create a cozy atmosphere for reading or socializing. This makes the candle a powerful yet simple decoration.

**Improved mood and Well-being:** Certain scents have the power to positively influence mood and promote a sense of well-being. Lavender, for example, is known for its calming and stress-reducing properties, while citrus scents can be energizing and uplifting. Choosing a candle with a fragrance that resonates with your emotional needs can contribute to a more positive and balanced state of mind.

**Focused Aromatherapy:** The controlled burn of an 8-ounce candle allows for a concentrated release of essential oils, making it ideal for targeted aromatherapy. Whether you're seeking to improve focus, relieve anxiety, or promote restful sleep, selecting a candle with specific essential oil blends can provide noticeable therapeutic benefits. For example, eucalyptus and peppermint can help clear sinuses, while sandalwood can promote relaxation and mental clarity.

**Home Deodorization and Freshness:** Besides their decorative and aromatherapy benefits, 8-ounce candles can also effectively neutralize unpleasant odors and freshen the air in your home. Candles with strong, clean scents, such as lemon or fir, can definitely help to eliminate lingering cooking smells or pet odors, leaving your home smelling clean and inviting. The right scent can also provide a lingering aroma long after the candle is extinguished.

**Gift Giving Versatility:** An 8-ounce candle makes an excellent and versatile gift for a wide range of occasions. They are appropriate for housewarmings, birthdays, holidays, or as a simple gesture of appreciation. The variety of scents and styles available ensures you can find a candle that perfectly suits the recipient's taste and preferences. A thoughtful candle can show that you pay attention to their interests and enjoyments.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of 8-ounce candles can sometimes bring up a few common questions. Here are some of the most frequently asked to help guide your purchasing decisions.

**How do I prevent my candle from tunneling?**
Tunneling occurs when a candle burns only in the center, leaving a ring of un-melted wax around the edges. To prevent this, allow the candle to burn for at least 2-3 hours during its first use, or until the entire surface is melted.This establishes a ""memory ring"" that will encourage the candle to burn evenly throughout its lifespan.

**How often should I trim the wick,and how much should I trim off?**
Trimming the wick is essential for maintaining a clean and consistent burn. Trim the wick to about 1/4 inch before each use. This prevents excessive smoking, soot production, and uneven burning. Using a wick trimmer is ideal, but scissors or nail clippers can also work.

**What should I do with the container after my candle has finished burning?**
Once your candle has reached the end of its lifespan, clean out the remaining wax and repurpose the container. You can melt the wax out using a double boiler or carefully scraping it out with a spoon. Glass jars can be used to store small items, as vases for flowers, or as decorative containers.Ceramic vessels can similarly serve as decorative elements or storage solutions.

**Are soy wax candles better for the habitat than paraffin wax candles?**
Soy wax is generally considered to be a more environmentally kind option than paraffin wax. Soy wax is derived from a renewable resource (soybeans), while paraffin wax is a byproduct of petroleum refining. Soy wax also burns cleaner, producing less soot and fewer harmful chemicals. though, the environmental impact of any candle also depends on factors such as fragrance sourcing and manufacturing practices.

1m41hk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Emminoonaimnida/comments/1m41hk4/existential_crisis_im_drowning_in_pessimism_and/,Existential crisis: I'm drowning in pessimism and nihilism. (hopefully this can bring peace),"
From my own experience swimming in deep waters: 

There is the potential to drown in pessimism and nihilism because we can't avoid the ugly truth.

so, how do I deal with the fallout of this hopelessness
when I engage with the enemy? I feel like I'm going to war every time I look for answers and discover nothing but negativity. where is the hope? everything tells me how to stay in it but I want to get out of it!
----
I must set my mind to observe, dissociated (not disassociated :) from the  enemy. if I'm not detached, I can lose that battle and become weary and hopeless. 

however the experience of that loss can be turned around if I know how to take that pain and turn it away from myself and towards the real threat. that pain was a weapon against me, but it's mine now.. I will use it to understand my enemy and use it against it. 

all that pain and confusion I can now leverage it. I need to learn how to become a thief, and a warrior, and a liar and a cheater so that I know how my enemy thinks. Because I'm not going to lie and cheat and steal from people, no, I'm going to do all of these things to my enemy but I have to know what I'm dealing with and I can't be a good person to do this. That's why everybody tells you to lead with love however they lead with murder. Do you see? they want you to be a good person and without tools to defend yourself against them.

We can't go through this life not knowing our enemy, so here's how it operates to consume us..

THERE ARE TWO ENEMIES:
one enemy is our friend, and the other enemy is the collective nihilism of our age. 

it is the collective thoughts of everyone's septic state of mind. every time someone has a ""bad"" thought or a ""bad"" feeling, they say ""I'm a Christian"" I can't think that way, or ""I'm a light being"" I have to feel good, not bad.. instead of dealing with that negativity (that I created), I rip it out and I throw it away, but it has to go somewhere. 

8 billion people rip negativity out of themselves and ""throw it away"" 10x a day or more - the bad thoughts of people in denial (not those of us trying to figure this out) has collected together in a thought form that crushes us and that is why we feel the way we feel all the time, for some reason or for no reason at all.

SORRY, THE TWO ENEMIES: 
:) 
The enemy that threw me into existential crisis after existential crisis/the one that makes me uncomfortable with staying put is my friend. some people called this enemy the dark night of the soul.

The other enemy is this thought form of 8 billion people, which is why it feels crushing. i'm desperate to find answers and it leverages my curiosity to bury me in pessimism and hopelessness in order to stagnate and decay.

I came to understood this to help me stay balanced in existential crisis:

my friend enemy is there to push me out of harms way and back out to the deep, where it is safe. it seems like it's trying to kill me, and it kind of is, but it's doing it for me because - it is me...

when I stop labeling the world as bad evil and dangerous, my friend enemy becomes just my friend. I understand that there isn't anything evil, that there isn't anything bad, that there isn't anything dangerous, so I 
Get rid of that injured thinking, I get rid of all the rules, I get rid of being obedient to everything I've been taught and I wiped the slight clean, and began listening to myself. 

I allow my conscious awareness to merge with my subconscious and become whole. my subconscious is my instinct, it knows what to do if I just listen to it. once we develop a relationship with one another, it will protect me from all of this confusion and fear and lack of direction, because it is my compass.

when I don't trust myself and my instinct and I sabotage myself. so while I think IT is my enemy, I am actually its enemy. 
it is telling me an absurd notion to do, and I want to do it, but I ignore it and listen to what sounds logical instead, because I don't wanna look like an idiot. however my subconscious absurdity is the way out of this logical linear prison that is making me miserable. no one needs to know anything, I need to do everything in private anyway. what everyone told us to think say and do got us into this mess, I've gotta stop listening to it.

When I assigned something as wrong, it doesn't make it wrong, it makes it my enemy. 

Red hair is wrong, it is now my enemy. Swearing is wrong, it is now my enemy. 

I like red hair, it is now my friend. I love to swear, it is now my friend. 

When I remove all of the labels and categories and boxes, I turn my gaze off of fighting against my made up enemies and I can now put my energy on the real fight. I was fighting a fight the red hair was wrong this whole time, but I changed it by changing out would think about it. 

I freed myself and realize I've been in the wrong fight this whole time against myself and my perceived red haired enemies, and I spend years deconstructing all of what I constructed. 

when I'm done with that, now I get to see what is true, and what is standing before me that is keeping me from where I wanna go.

my life is like an island hop in the middle of nowhere, and each island holds provisions for a certain amount of time, and if I get scared or hopeless and stay there too long, I'm going to starve and dehydrate and die. so my instinct pushes me back out into the deep to find another island. or to use relatable terminology, it pushes me into another dark night of the soul.

now, the real opponent's goal is to do whatever it takes to get me to stay on that one island - where I starve and dehydrate and die. it is insidious. but I've stopped fighting myself and I've turned towards it and I see it for what it is, it's not really a threat anymore, but I've got to stay vigilant, because the real opponent is simply an idea.

Think about the ideas that pop into your head and keep you from what you really wanna do, this is the real opponent, you just have to get over the idea. 

and it is a stupid nothing idea trying to hold you back. when you allow yourself to face your fears, when you allow yourself to imagine the unimaginable, it's the only way to illuminate everything.

fears... 
-you can't say that
-You can't do that
-You can't think that way
-Your imagination is your enemy, it's maladaptive
-you can't behave that way

actually, I can do anything I want, and I will. 

we keep asking ourselves am I? am I good enough? Am I successful? Am I this, am I that? that's what this world has to offer, doubt, period.

now this world is conditional so you have to use my imagination to do all of this work. This world will not let me, so I created my own world where I can and I will. This is true manifesting, because once I have created my world where I have 378 billion dollars in my account, I CAN and I will. 

it will print out into this world eventually, but I have to learn how to do it properly before it prints out and it evolves. I have to understand that my imagination is where I learn all of lessons and solve all of my problems. not here in the world, they are in my imagination. 

there I'm an assassin, a geneticist, a mom, a friend, a sister, anything I want to be. I have lived over 1000 years in my narrative and I have millions of timelines I jump to when I'm bored with one I go to another one and I start a new one. and then when I'm ready I'll go back to the ones that I created and I'll continue my narrative. and the only thing that is allowed in this world is infinite possibilities and abundance. 

this world is where I go to do the unimaginable (get relief) so that I can decide how I feel about it. I already know how everybody else feels about it they can't shut up about what they think. 

This world that I created is mine and no one else's. this imaginary world is where my choice comes into play in the real world.

how I feel about what exists and if I want to do it or not is how the real world comes into play. To be or not to be, that is the question. but I don't know if I want to be or not to be if I haven't imagined it beforehand.

free will is attached to my subconscious/imagination, not my conscious awareness. my conscious awareness is 5% my subconscious is 95%, so I can end self sabotage once I stop fighting against myself in the real world and move to my imagination where I can figure it out like a puzzle.

Choice.. how I choose is everything (not what). choose btw a candy bar and a steak. 

The candy bar and the steak are the same thing, it's a distraction from the real choice.

my belief that I create in my imagination is the (how) that determines everything. it isn't whether I choose a candy bar or a steak, it's what I believe about the choice that is put before me. If I believe I can only choose a candy bar or a steak then I'm lost. There are infinite choices in front of me, but the candy bar and the steak is the distraction, because I've been programmed to believe that all of that exist is the candy bar in the steak.

organic or not, it's all the same.. if I believe that eating dog shit out of the yards of other people is nourishing my body, then it will. But I have to be 100% on the same page with my belief for this to work, which is why manifesting didn't work at first. I was a divided mind. 

to each his own.. this a fingerprint, bespoke, and I have to be 100% committed to it in order for it to work. I can't let the doubts infect my project, which is why I have to learn to fight the real enemy properly. 

how I arrive at the choices I make is everything. I need to forge my own codes of conduct.

all of this is being said so that I can find my way back to myself and understand what's happening, because any answer I hoped to find in this world (book, web page, even beautiful philosophy) is propaganda.. however philosophy was there to slingshot me into ""the further"" which is my subconscious/imagination/polarity/childhood. my childhood represents what could have been and what can still be.

this life is for the dreamers. If I cannot dream and imagine my own way out, the way out is hidden from me. This world is calling our imagination maladaptive and it's simply not true. not only is it not true it, is the path to death. 

I do everything in private. I don't answer to anyone but myself, but until I could establish that and be strong, I need to do this without outside interference. I was awake out in the open, but my true life (my encrypted inner life which is secret and nobody can touch and fuck with) was being created and nobody could interfere because they didn't know about it. 

it needs to be protected from categories boxes and labels such as a diagnosis of maladaptive daydreaming. i'm not here to conform to the world the world needs to conform to me.

Everything in this world is propaganda and is unencrypted. my true nature is encrypted. my real life is encrypted.

even people like me, when we get this far, we sound bitter and pessimistic because this world is found to be so grotesque. all of us who know what we're talking about have forged warrior and have now become samurai. we shed a lot of blood and have killed ourselves over and over to get where we are. we've had to destroy our own narratives thousands of times and once we did, we saw the world - a giant battlefield covered in the innocence of red. we see all of the unnecessary violence of this world and we hate it.

we are on the same page with ourselves, so we are not under any illusion that we need to be a good person. we are are neither good nor bad, we are necessary. our hearts and imaginations are stunning, tho.

and our hearts and imaginations are encrypted, so others don't really get to see that part of us. they see the unencrypted part which appears to them as being a complete asshole ü§≠, but because of this delusion rainbow coffee world, we will always be seen as the villain.

I (40M) am married with kids, and this past week my wife (40F) told me her car's AC wasn't working. I suggested she take it to a local repair shop (we both work full-time in medicine, 40+ hours a week), but she said she already had a dealership appointment scheduled in two weeks and would wait until then.

All week, she‚Äôs been complaining about the AC during her drive home and usually calls me to talk‚Äîexcept now she just texts me that she‚Äôs on her way because I can‚Äôt hear her over the wind noise with the windows down.

This morning (Saturday), she had plans with friends and was taking the kids to a local pool/fun spot while I stayed home to handle chores‚Äîlaundry, mowing the lawn, cleaning the house, etc.

While I was having coffee and switching over the laundry, she started complaining again about the AC. I mentioned that there are local shops open today that could probably take a look at it. She got upset and said she didn‚Äôt want to sit around waiting for it to be fixed‚Äîshe‚Äôd rather spend time with her friends.

I told her I understood, no one wants to deal with car issues, but it‚Äôs summer, and driving around with no AC sucks. I even offered my vehicle, but she declined because she‚Äôs damaged it in the past and hates driving it.

Then she said, *""Well, actually, why don‚Äôt I take your car and you can take mine to the shop?""*

I just stared at her‚ÄîI was already annoyed. I‚Äôve got a full day of chores at home, and now she wants me to deal with her car while she goes out to the pool? I told her I didn‚Äôt have the time today and she should either take it on a weekday when she‚Äôs off or reconsider her plans.

She got irritated and replied, *""Guess I'll just drive around in my hot car.""* I responded, *""Priorities.""*

I knew that pissed her off, but I couldn‚Äôt help it. I‚Äôm struggling with the feeling that her time is always protected, while mine is just expected to be spent working or doing chores. Am I just supposed to keep sacrificing my time while she gets to relax?

I was on my way to a date. Didn‚Äôt want to be that guy who shows up late. If she got there before me, I‚Äôd feel bad for making her wait. So I left early, took the bus, and was texting her on Snapchat.

She had asked for my Snap a few hours earlier, and I shared my handle (this becomes important later). Right after she added me, she started sending snaps of her dress. Nothing explicit, just teasing and playful ü§≠. That continued through the ride, and I almost missed my stop at Church Street in the middle of our chit-chat.

Walked to Third Wave Coffee, went in, and booked a seat, and she kept texting me till she reached outside.

I went out to meet her. She showed up in this cute dress, looks great and really nailed the look üòç. I suddenly felt a bit underwhelming next to her; I was just in my usual casuals (yep, my fashion sense is bad), nothing special.

# Imaginary Authors- Yesterday Haze

*Creamy Fig*

**Notes -**¬†

Whipped Cream, Fig, Woody Notes, Walnut, Iris, Tonka Bean, Fruity Notes

This has a beautiful, creamy opening - the prominent fig note is ripe and fruity rather than green, blended with a gorgeous lactonic whipped cream note. I appreciate the *fuzziness* that a lactonic note adds to a blend - sweet too, but the wood notes keep the sweetness balanced.

The initial sweet fruitiness fades in the drydown, where the woody and nutty facets start to take over, with a floral edge from the iris note.

The walnut and cream combo reminds me of [Zadig & Voltaire This is Her](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Zadig-Voltaire/This-is-Her-39358.html) with added fig - the sillage is sweet and figgy still, but so well-balanced. I *really* like this scent! 

This feels super autumnal - woody and nutty, with the fig lasting through the wear.

This also lasts an incredibly long time - I sprayed at 8am and could still smell this oh my wrist, and still had faint sillage too, when I went for a shower 13 hours later.

An incredible scent imo - Imaginary Authors is often listed as one of the most overrated niche houses and this is the first one I've ever tried. It does make me want to try more - I'm so impressed by the balance of this perfume.

# Le Labo - The Noir 29

*Dark Fig*

**Notes -**¬†

**Top -** Fig, Bay Leaf, Bergamot

**Middle -** Cedar, Vetiver, Musk¬†

**Base -** Tobacco, Hay

This often comes up in fig discussions as a favourite and I really thought I would love this - but I've realised this has a note that I never enjoy and always really bothers my nose - **hay**. 

All I can smell in the opening is hay and tobacco with a touch of fig. I am surprised Fragrantica users have voted this as feminine over masculine cause this smells very masc to my nose. My nose must be very sensitive to whatever is in the hay note because it's all I can pick up - musty and stale.  

A disappointment.

# BDK Parfums- Gris Charnel

*Aromatic Fig*

**Notes -**¬†

**Top -** Cardamom, Fig. Black Tea¬†

**Middle -** Iris, Bourbon Vetiver

**Base -** Sandalwood, Tonka Bean

I got this sample a while ago alongside a sample of [Liam Grey](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Lattafa-Perfumes/Liam-85097.html) to see if it was worth buying a bottle of the dupe and wow, this is one of my favourite scent profiles ever!

The opening is super creamy sandalwood and aromatic cardamon (quickly becoming one of my favourite notes) - a fresh, ripe fig comes in a little later with the tea note wrapping up a perfect blend.

After starting my perfume journey with a lot of sweet and fruity smells, my first sniff of this at a shop last autumn was a revelation to me. While truly unisex, I think this is feminine in a very sophisticated way, it has that 'rich lady with good taste' vibe, suits a corporate office setting (where I find myself when not working from home) and I pick up sillage for around 3 hours.

It has a calming, woody spa effect and definitely works for colder, grey weather (can imagine this being a bit nasty in heat). I'm in the 'believe the hype' camp with this one.

However, a bottle costs ¬£150 and Liam is a good dupe (with added vanilla) so I ended up buying a bottle of Liam. I will miss this sample, but now have access to this amazing profile for 15% of the price. My apologies to the good people at BDK.

# Byredo - Pulp

*Ripe Fig*

**Notes -**¬†

**Top -** Blackcurrant, Bergamot, Cardamon

**Middle -** Fig, Red Apple, Tiare Flower

**Base -** Praline, Peach Blossom, Cedar

This has a very strong opening! An overwhelming fruitiness, super ripe, juicy, sweet but also slightly bitter fig - blackcurrant is also very prominent, adding yet more fruity sweetness. Sillage is super super strong - I can smell this beast all around me, it's almost too much. 

Past the opening, the apple really comes into play- this is a ripe apple ('ripe' is definitely the theme of this perfume - and funny that that word is used a lot to describe both good and bad smells), one of the most realistic apple notes I've smelled. I avoid apple-forward scents as they always smell synthetic to me - this really smells like a good apple tastes - one of those posh Pink Lady apples too!

This is super long lasting - I had sillage at the end of my work day. Considering Byredo's reputation of zero lasting power, Pulp really kicked the trend.

However, I did find the intense fruitiness a little cloying as the day went on. This is a super impressive perfume, unlike anything I've smelled, and probably one the the 'fruitiest' perfumes I've tested - but it's not something, to my personal taste, I would want to smell like all day.

Fruit note lovers should definitely try this!

# Diptyque- Philosykos EDP

*Green Fig*

**Notes -**¬†

**Top -** Fig Leaf, Fig¬†

**Middle -** Green Notes, Coconut¬†

**Base -** Fig Tree, Woody Notes, Cedar

Another super green crushed stems and vegetal opening- it's got a super realistic freshness to it.

I'm surprised this is such a popular scent as I think the green opening feels quite niche! But it's so cooling, and I'm testing this on a hot day - I appreciate it. 

This evolves a lot in the drydown as the bitter, vegetal green starts to fade, other facets start to appear - ripe fig flesh, creaminess, and a touch of coconut that makes this **so** beautiful for the summer.

The concept of 'the entire fig tree' is fully realised once this scent settles. It is still green, with woody, sweet, fruity, figgy, fresh and creamy edges. 

This lasted about four hours on my skin on a hot day with faint sillage throughout. 

**8/10**

# DS&DURGA - Debaser

*Coconut Fig*

**Notes -**¬†

**Top -** Stems Greens, Bergamot, Pear

**Middle -** Fig, Coconut Milk, Iris

**Base -** Precious Woods, Tonka Bean, Moss

The opening of this is very green- crushed stems and leaves, very strong and perfect for the hot sunny day outside, slightly bitter and refreshing- the fig is there, but smells like a very green fig rather than sweet - a fig leaf. More of the fruit comes out in the drydown, but it is far from sweet.

The coconut feels far fainter to me than most reviews suggest - the smell is more the actual flesh of the coconut - I sometimes buy chunks of coconut flesh to snack on in the summer and feel like it has a very faint, but fresh smell - this is what this coconut note smells like to me - not coconut milk.

Lasted about four hours on my skin, but I preferred Philosykos. 

**7/10**

# 19-69 - Invisible Post

*Bitter Fig*

At the start of my perfume journey in 2020 I was on the hunt for a perfume that smelled like cut grass. I settled on [Kate Spade Truly Gracious](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kate-Spade/TRULYgracious-47553.html), but the opening of this is very evocative of that freshly mown lawn smell - amazingly green, cut grass and stems with the fig and tangerine floating in the background. I think this is very particular, not to everyone's tastes but I like a green-forward scent, especially in hotter weather.

The pettigrain note is very dominant in the opening, leafy and a touch bitter - refreshing.

On a second wear, I felt like this is the perfect meeting point between the very green fig of Philosykos and the very fruity fig of Pulp. It's refreshing and well-balanced. Very unisex to me. It's basically Debaser with the coconut removed.

This lasted a good six hours on my skin. I actually got this as a free sample with an order of samples and was pleasantly surprised!

**7/10**

# Jo Malone- Fig & Lotus Flower

*Floral Fig*

**Notes -**¬†

**Top -** Fig Leaf

**Middle -** Lotus

**Base -** Vetiver

The fig opening has both the fresh, fruity and green facets of the fig note, blended with pleasant, slightly aquatic, floral notes. It is light, refreshing, delicate, feminine.

The green really shines in the heart, but it isn't a super grassy green note like in Invisible Post - this is summery, sunshiney, slightly coconutty. The note says fig leaf but I definitely sense the fruit too. It's watery and pretty- so wearable.

I gave this a second wear outside in the heat and can confirm it does shine.

This isn't a hugely long lasting scent bit still better than Jo Malone's reputation suggests - gone from my wrist in three hours and didn't mind topping up after that - beautiful perfume, perfect for spring. One of the more creative 'fruity florals' I've sampled.

**8/10**

# Lancome - Figues & Agumes

*Jasmine Fig*

**Notes -**¬†

**Top -** Petitgrain, Fig, Tangerine

**Middle -** Palm Leaf, Black Currant, Cyclamen

**Base -** Sandalwood, Cedar, Tonka Bean

After realising I love jasmine perfumes earlier this year, I was desperate to try a jasmine fig scent.

Opening is lovely- fresh, fruity and citrusy with that gorgeous lush jasmine note (I am fully addicted to jasmine these days). The fig is fruity and green- not super fruity, a fresher take on fig flesh than Pulp.

The fig definitely goes into the background on drydown, and to my pleasant surprise the jasmine note is very prominent in this! It's a soapy jasmine - and perfect for the hot spring day outside. There are beachy and coconutty nuances too.

The drydown is essentially a fresh, beachy jasmine. Zero complaints from me!

This lasted longer than expected, around 6 hours with faint sillage for around 4. I loved this scent - the fig and jasmine combo is so appealing to me!

**9/10**

# Noyz - Shitty Day

*Woody Fig*

**Notes -**¬†

**Top -** Eucalyptus, Bergamot, Coconut Water

**Middle -** Fig, Clary Sage, Salt, Lavender, Cucumber, Violet¬†

**Base -** Amber, Cedarwood, Tonka Bean

So excited to try this one after Perfumerism recommended the range (alas, I was *influenced*). I think I like every single note and I love salt and cucumber notes.

The opening definitely smells like an expensive spa product- fresh salty notes, a touch of fruitiness from the fig, herbaceous lavender and sage all very noticeable in the opening. When I smell my wrist I pick up the cooling cucumber and a touch of the coconut water - this is a beautiful blend, so calming and soothing.

More cedar and eucalyptus in the drydown, which I don't like as much as the opening- I am not sure about the eucalyptus note - this sounds horrible but it kind of smells like spit??? I get a lot of sillage with this, but sometimes I get a slightly 'spitty' note which I'm not a fan of.

This lasts a good six hours.

**7/10 -** I love the first half of the experience but the drydown was a touch bothersome.

  
& there we go - when I plan these explorations I like to try and find 10 completely different takes, but I have to admit that Philosykos, Invisible Post and Debaser were all quite similar, with Philosykos winning out. Are there any that you feel like I missed out on? Give me your favourite figs!

What I noticed this and last year: the prices for food, daily necessities, clothing are now comparable to or in some cases even higher than in countries like Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark. Yet, average wages in Poland remain significantly lower even after the high increases.

These thing have always been more expensive in Poland:

* Electronics (e.g., Apple products) have always been more expensive than in Germany.
* Clothing from international chains like H&M costs roughly the same as in Western Europe.
* Cosmetics and household items from shops like Rossmann are often more expensive
* Used cars are also priced higher than expected.

What used to be much cheaper, but isn't now:

* Coffee
* Beer
* Kebabs now cost only slightly less
* Vacation rentals in popular destinations like Gda≈Ñsk are priced similarly to those in Germany, Denmark, or Portugal. Renting a small house near lakes is 100-200‚Ç¨ per day what is even more expensive.
* food in the supermarket

The Wage Gap:

Despite the price convergence with Western Europe, wages in Poland have not caught up. Many people still earn only or less than ‚Ç¨10 net per hour. This wage disparity means that, in real terms, a cup of coffee or a tube of toothpaste is twice as expensive for a Pole than for someone earning Western European wages.

Housing Costs:

To make matters worse, rents have skyrocketed. For example, renting an apartment in Gda≈Ñsk now costs nearly as much as renting in mid-tier German cities (B-class cities like Leipzig, Hanover, or Nuremberg).

On the other hand, I see so many expensive new cars like Audi, BMW SUVs, every other person with an iphone? Coffee shops are full. So people seem to have much more money than in the past, but the numbers don't add up.

Maybe you are lucky if you don't need to pay rent as you live with your parents, but moving from rural areas to the big cities for jobs seems like a trap.

First complaint: The ranch fucking reeks (sorry for the rough language ma, but I need it to get my point across).¬† I get that it's a ranch but all that's here is a few wild animals roaming the deep parts of the ranch and corn fields for miles like we‚Äôre in goddamn Iowa.¬† So how does it smell like a giant dog is shitting in the house every day.¬†¬†

Second: Lola refuses to change even a second of her plans, if it's pouring rain it doesn't matter because she planned for us to walk through the ranch, if it's 120 goddamn degrees it doesn't matter because that was our midday picnic.¬† And I‚ÄôM the bad guy for trying to just sit inside for a few minutes.¬†¬†

**Supernatural forum post from Mitchell Harris ‚ÄúI saw a werewolf in Chalcagua Nevada‚Äù**¬†

It was dark out, I was alone out in a stretch of desert covered in small shrubs and weeds in June.¬† Most of the search party for Jesse Higgins, a missing local, had quit, it‚Äôd been almost six months after all.¬† I had a flashlight and slowly walked through the empty dark, calling out his name every so often.¬† Two red beads peered at me from the largest bush of this stretch of desert.¬† I figured it was some sort of animal so I kept moving, calling out Jesse one more time.¬†¬†

It sounded like a groan from the bush and I whipped my head around to see an almost humanlike arm covered in hair and matted fur, with a gargantuan hand and half foot long claws reaching from the bush.¬† I stepped back, my blood running cold.

‚ÄúJesse?‚Äù

Another groan, the full beast left the bush now, I couldn't make out the silhouette, it blended in with the black, starless night.¬† But I saw his face‚Ä¶ god his face. It was so inhuman yet so remarkably human, it was Jesse's face, the face I had my first drink with, the face I skipped class with.¬† Jesse Harris, my childhood best friend, had turned into something so terrifying that I turned and sprinted away.¬† The cops wrote it off as hysteria mixed with a coyote encounter, but I knew it was something more.¬† Has anyone else in Nevada (Humboldt county specifically) encountered something similar? Please tell me I'm not insane.¬†¬†

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That is all the files I could get my hands on before the leak was plugged by the FBI.¬† But this case was swept under the rug, I tried to call the police station to ask questions but all I got was ‚Äúthe situation is resolved, please do not contact us again about this tragedy.‚Äù¬† There‚Äôs no way this isn't connected, something happened in Chalcagua Nevada, people died.¬† And the FBI went to cover it all up.¬† I hope this reaches someone from there, if so, do you have any insights? I tried to contact Mitchell Harris about his sighting but he went off the grid shortly after posting that blog.¬†",1,1752944624.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

""Look, I don‚Äôt know what you heard, but none of this is real, alright? Just a story. Just some burnt-out punk scribblin‚Äô down half-memories and demon rumors. If it sounds like someone you know, well, maybe that‚Äôs your own damn problem. No one‚Äôs naming names. No one‚Äôs confessing anything. It‚Äôs all made up, yeah? Contracts, curses, dead principals grinning like they know something you don‚Äôt‚Äîbullshit fiction. So relax. Unless you're Coyote. In which case, hey, deal‚Äôs a deal.‚Äù

Now back to the story...

Im sitting on the edge of three towns. Victorville, Hesperia, and Apple Valley. Magic has always been wild at this specific spot. 

The old charter school I went to shut down a decade ago. Now it‚Äôs a realtor‚Äôs office, which makes things a little more complicated. I wanted to see if the curses I left behind were still there. I know they shouldn‚Äôt work anymore, probably never did. But it‚Äôd be just another cosmic joke if the place got flipped into something so bland, so harmless.

My mother always said the stalkers were why we had to keep moving. Couldn‚Äôt be her fault. Couldn‚Äôt be the way she turned neighbors into enemies because one of them wore a green shirt with blue shoes. Anything about them would trigger her. A glance, a cough, the color of their shoelaces.

I‚Äôm sitting in a caf√© that‚Äôs been here since high school. Back then, I used to have meetings here every Tuesday with the Zippo Man. It‚Äôs eerie how the place hasn‚Äôt changed. My usual table by the window still looks out toward the school, now an empty office building.

I try to shake the memories loose and take a sip of coffee. Strong. Warm. Like a hug that knows how to hurt just right.

The bell over the door rings. I don‚Äôt look up. But then I hear footsteps I recognize.

‚ÄúHey stranger. Figured I‚Äôd find you here,‚Äù Thomas says, pulling out the chair and giving me that look, can I sit?

I nod, sip again.

‚ÄúIt is Tuesday,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúFigured you stopped by the police station by now. And knowing you, you‚Äôd want to see the school again, from this spot.‚Äù

He takes in the scenery like I did. Same walls, same cracks, same ghosts.

‚ÄúOnly place with decent coffee,‚Äù I say, raising my cup.

‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs the only place you know of,‚Äù he says, grinning. ‚ÄúHoping to run into anyone?‚Äù

I hate how he knows me, how he always has. I sip again, and suddenly it‚Äôs senior year all over again. There‚Äôs Thomas in his denim vest, patches from every metal band that ever mattered. Always watching, always curious about who I met in this place.

‚ÄúCome on, man. Let me meet him just once,‚Äù he‚Äôd say.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt something I want you part of,‚Äù I‚Äôd tell him, and feel that pinch of guilt.

Thomas knew every crime I‚Äôd committed, every backroom deal. He was always the ride away from trouble. But I couldn‚Äôt let him meet him. Not when my crimes stopped being about survival and started being about favors, power, reputation.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give me that shit,‚Äù he‚Äôd plead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you bleeding, helped patch you up more times than Miss Loveheart could count.‚Äù

And every time, I‚Äôd talk him down, get him to walk away.

Until the one day he didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúCome on, Jamie. Don‚Äôt send your friend off before I get a chance to say hello,‚Äù the tall man said, flicking his Zippo open and shut like punctuation.

He extended his hand to Thomas.

Thomas, like a damn idiot, shook it like he was meeting the president.

‚ÄúHello, mister‚Ä¶ I never caught your name. Jamie never told me.‚Äù

With a grin too wide to be real, the man said, ‚ÄúMy name is Coyote, young man. Now if you‚Äôll excuse us, we have business to discuss.‚Äù He clapped Thomas on the back like a proud uncle.

Back in the caf√©, I‚Äôm holding coffee gone lukewarm.

‚ÄúI was just hoping to find a way into that building,‚Äù I tell Thomas.

‚ÄúJamie‚Ä¶ listen, man. Nobody goes into that place. I mean nobody. Bought in 2013, and it‚Äôs been empty ever since.‚Äù

I nod. Figures.

Thomas fills me in on what I missed. I let him. Feels like something out of a story I half-remember.

Miss Loveheart, our principal, got married two years after I left. Not graduated. Just vanished. Left the school, my family, everything.

Coyote followed, though. Said I made a contract.

In 2012, they found Miss Loveheart and her husband dead. Big grins frozen on their faces. School shut down not long after.

I go to the counter and order two more coffees.

‚ÄúThis is all interesting, Tommy,‚Äù I say, handing him his cup, ‚Äúbut I want to know if anyone had ties to the KKK. Or‚Ä¶ maybe that‚Äôs outdated. Anyone turn skinhead? Start carrying hate in their heart?‚Äù

He blinks. Then leans back.

‚ÄúWell, now that you mention it‚Ä¶ you remember Mr. Snake? History teacher?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Used to lose his shit when no one participated. What about him?‚Äù

‚ÄúStarted hanging with some neo-Nazis. Right after the school shut down. Could be nothing. Could be what you‚Äôre looking for.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I say. Then lower my voice. ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been off the grid up here. Destroyed my lighter. You know anyone I can get some work from?‚Äù

‚ÄúWork that matches your‚Ä¶ talents?‚Äù

I nod. ‚ÄúYeah. Nothing involving magic though. That part of my life‚Äôs done. Something semi-legit.‚Äù

Thomas laughs. ‚ÄúI got just the guy.‚Äù

I originally got my Keurig from here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers and it's been my daily companion ever since.

Let me break down my top picks for K-Cups that consistently deliver great taste:

1. Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend
This light roast is perfect for morning coffee drinkers. It's smooth, never bitter, and has just enough caffeine to get you going. The flavor is clean with slight citrus notes.

2. Peet's Coffee Major Dickason's Blend
If you love dark roast, this is your go-to. It's rich, full-bodied, and complex without being overwhelming. Perfect for those who want their coffee to pack a punch.

3. The Original Donut Shop Regular
This medium roast is incredibly balanced. It's what I recommend to friends who are just starting with their Keurig machines. It's neither too bold nor too weak - just right for any time of day.

4. Caribou Coffee Caribou Blend
A medium roast with woodsy, spicy notes. It's smooth enough for morning coffee but complex enough to enjoy throughout the day.

5. Death Wish Coffee
For those days when regular coffee just won't cut it. It's seriously strong but surprisingly smooth. Just be careful with this one - it's not called Death Wish for nothing!

One thing I've learned is that storage matters. Keep your K-Cups in a cool, dry place. Don't stock up too many at once - they're best used within 3-6 months.

Pro tip: If you're new to Keurig brewing, start with the 8oz setting. It gives you the best flavor concentration. You can adjust from there based on your preference.

For those still shopping for a Keurig machine, I got mine here and they have great deals: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Something worth mentioning - don't forget to clean your Keurig regularly. It makes a huge difference in taste. I descale mine every 3-4 months using white vinegar or the Keurig descaling solution.

Also, consider getting a reusable K-Cup filter. It's better for the environment and lets you use your favorite ground coffee when you want to mix things up.

Remember, the best K-Cup for you depends on your personal taste. Start with these recommendations and experiment from there. You might be surprised by what becomes your favorite!

I've found that brewing temperature also affects taste significantly. Most Keurig machines brew at optimal temperature, but if yours has temperature control, try different settings to find your sweet spot.

These recommendations come from my personal experience and countless cups of coffee. What works for me might not be your cup of tea (or coffee), but these are solid starting points for most coffee drinkers.",1,1752944511.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

My mother always said the stalkers were why we had to keep moving. Couldn‚Äôt be her fault. Couldn‚Äôt be the way she turned neighbors into enemies because one of them wore a green shirt with blue shoes. Anything about them would trigger her. A glance, a cough, the color of their shoelaces.

I‚Äôm sitting in a caf√© that‚Äôs been here since high school. Back then, I used to have meetings here every Tuesday with the Zippo Man. It‚Äôs eerie how the place hasn‚Äôt changed. My usual table by the window still looks out toward the school, now an empty office building.

I try to shake the memories loose and take a sip of coffee. Strong. Warm. Like a hug that knows how to hurt just right.

The bell over the door rings. I don‚Äôt look up. But then I hear footsteps I recognize.

‚ÄúHey stranger. Figured I‚Äôd find you here,‚Äù Thomas says, pulling out the chair and giving me that look, can I sit?

I nod, sip again.

‚ÄúIt is Tuesday,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúFigured you stopped by the police station by now. And knowing you, you‚Äôd want to see the school again, from this spot.‚Äù

He takes in the scenery like I did. Same walls, same cracks, same ghosts.

‚ÄúOnly place with decent coffee,‚Äù I say, raising my cup.

‚ÄúNo. It‚Äôs the only place you know of,‚Äù he says, grinning. ‚ÄúHoping to run into anyone?‚Äù

I hate how he knows me, how he always has. I sip again, and suddenly it‚Äôs senior year all over again. There‚Äôs Thomas in his denim vest, patches from every metal band that ever mattered. Always watching, always curious about who I met in this place.

‚ÄúCome on, man. Let me meet him just once,‚Äù he‚Äôd say.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt something I want you part of,‚Äù I‚Äôd tell him, and feel that pinch of guilt.

Thomas knew every crime I‚Äôd committed, every backroom deal. He was always the ride away from trouble. But I couldn‚Äôt let him meet him. Not when my crimes stopped being about survival and started being about favors, power, reputation.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give me that shit,‚Äù he‚Äôd plead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you bleeding, helped patch you up more times than Miss Loveheart could count.‚Äù

And every time, I‚Äôd talk him down, get him to walk away.

Until the one day he didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúCome on, Jamie. Don‚Äôt send your friend off before I get a chance to say hello,‚Äù the tall man said, flicking his Zippo open and shut like punctuation.

He extended his hand to Thomas.

Thomas, like a damn idiot, shook it like he was meeting the president.

‚ÄúHello, mister‚Ä¶ I never caught your name. Jamie never told me.‚Äù

With a grin too wide to be real, the man said, ‚ÄúMy name is Coyote, young man. Now if you‚Äôll excuse us, we have business to discuss.‚Äù He clapped Thomas on the back like a proud uncle.

Back in the caf√©, I‚Äôm holding coffee gone lukewarm.

‚ÄúI was just hoping to find a way into that building,‚Äù I tell Thomas.

‚ÄúJamie‚Ä¶ listen, man. Nobody goes into that place. I mean nobody. Bought in 2013, and it‚Äôs been empty ever since.‚Äù

I nod. Figures.

Thomas fills me in on what I missed. I let him. Feels like something out of a story I half-remember.

Miss Loveheart, our principal, got married two years after I left. Not graduated. Just vanished. Left the school, my family, everything.

Coyote followed, though. Said I made a contract.

In 2012, they found Miss Loveheart and her husband dead. Big grins frozen on their faces. School shut down not long after.

I go to the counter and order two more coffees.

‚ÄúThis is all interesting, Tommy,‚Äù I say, handing him his cup, ‚Äúbut I want to know if anyone had ties to the KKK. Or‚Ä¶ maybe that‚Äôs outdated. Anyone turn skinhead? Start carrying hate in their heart?‚Äù

He blinks. Then leans back.

‚ÄúWell, now that you mention it‚Ä¶ you remember Mr. Snake? History teacher?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Used to lose his shit when no one participated. What about him?‚Äù

‚ÄúStarted hanging with some neo-Nazis. Right after the school shut down. Could be nothing. Could be what you‚Äôre looking for.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I say. Then lower my voice. ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been off the grid up here. Destroyed my lighter. You know anyone I can get some work from?‚Äù

‚ÄúWork that matches your‚Ä¶ talents?‚Äù

My wife and I just moved and we got (for very cheap) this gorgeous coffee table that belonged to an old lady who took the utmost care of her furniture. Unfortunately, the current finish seems to be very sensitive to the sun, you can see the paler sections. I also made a big but not very deep scratch on it during the move (middle picture)

We would like to refinish it, while keeping the general tones of the wood, and if possible have a finish that's bit more resistant as we don't plan to protect it like a museum piece.

Could anyone guide us in the right direction as to which type of finish the table currently has, and how to approach the refinishing process? We're both completely new to refinishing but I always loved working with wood and can't wait to give a new life to this table!

1m40v8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1m40v8i/i_need_your_opinion/,i need your opinion,"for context, my girlfriend and i are pretty big on tiktok and instagram. we arent ""famous"" enough to get brand deals or such but we do get recognised and stopped by a few people from our target demographic. another thing, my girlfriend and i previously worked at this other cafe (which closed down due to low sales) and learnt a lot about being a good barista and making quality coffee. we surely arent the best, but good. my girlfriend also has been baking for a really long time and know the basics and general techniques to baking, i cant comment on quality because i would obviously be biased. 

anyway, we started working at this 1 week old cafe/bakery. the owners are insufficiently experienced, seemingly only learning the bare minimum. they have no SOP and no recipes for their bakes, while the coffee and matcha are overpriced for their quality. they also dont really know how to promote the cafe well enough and during our time there the average was about 2-4 customers per day. they were pretty stingy about their coffee beans, requiring their employees to pay for the drinks. 

so we worked for a while and everything was fine, there are things that they could do better but my girlfriend and i chose not to suggest improvements because after all, we're still new there, and did plan on giving feedback when the time is right. we did what they told us with what we had while internally dying because of the poor quality. 

on our first shift, i calibrated the coffee machine to my best abilities. there definitely was an improvement to the taste in coffee after, but i did ""waste"" quite a lot of beans during the process which is quite natural, since the machine was poorly calibrated in the first place.  i understand why they would be upset about this, but it did give out better coffee. on that shift, the owner pulled me out and told me that she wants to put me as both a barista and a baker instead of letting me focus on being a barista which is what she promised when i went for the interview. i mean im fine with it, baking is fun too but what didnt sit right with me is that this isnt what was agreed on during the interview. 

our second shift was a morning shift, so we had to open up the cafe. i turned the coffee machine on and made a cup of coffee to check the quality, something standard we learnt from our previous job and calibrated accordingly if necessary. after that, my girlfriend and i got to getting started on our bakes. they were pretty keen on the workers expressing their creative talent, so we designed the cake and muffins the way we (and they) thought were cute. however, i did open up the cafe to the public an hour early because i misread the opening hours. the owners came after a while and gently informed me that we open an hour late, to which i apologised and explained my side. she also asked me why i calibrated the machine again when i did it yesterday, and i explained the need for it. they understood and we went along with our shift. 

after that shift, we decided to follow them on tiktok and instagram, hoping that this would be the cafe we ended up working in until we've saved enough for university. i followed with my account, which is where most of our following is at since my girlfriend is more private. we also saw that their platform viewed ours. on my girlfriends shift alone one day, she had to cancel 2 hours prior since she woke up unwell. i understand why they would be upset but its not like they would experience any rush hour whatsoever. since that, they didn't put us on schedule at all, only rotating the same 3 people each week when we gave our schedules for the whole month, and hit more than the minimum requirement for commitment. 

today, we had to go in for a photoshoot where my girlfriend and i posed as their ""guests"", consuming the food and drinks they gave us for props (with their encouragement). this is when they told us that they wouldnt be giving us much shifts as they need people for the morning and thats when we arent available. the other 3 part timers worked full day for most of the week. they also said that, since we arent going to be on rotation much, they would just pay us for our 2 shifts + photoshoot immediately, like theyre getting it out of the way. before we left, they also took our aprons away when its not really a shared apron. after a while on the same day, they removed us from the work groupchat and told us its so that they dont spam us. 

a few add ons: during the scheduling issue talk, they ""allowed"" us to get other part time jobs since they werent going to put us on schedule much anymore,, they always called us ""sooooo cuteee"" if we do anything as much as laugh with each other  ",5,1752943582.0,SGExams,2,1.0,False

had a month-long intense situationship with this Aussie here in italy. he ended things unexpectedly, refused to see me again, then after a month he started watching my stories, two months later he blocked me even though I don't follow him and he has a private account: why do you think that is?

context:

I'll try to keep this short and dense. we met on tinder, this was my first kiss and our first time being intimate with someone. we met a number of times, I slept at his place a number of times, it felt magical and bla bla bla, you already heard this part of the story. he was here for the 6 month Erasmus, so we both knew we had limited time and that this would come to an end. one day I text him to arrange our next date, after an anomalous long wait he just told me he didn't want to keep seeing me, good luck and bye. I agreed on ending things, even though I disagreed on the timing, as we would have had more time to enjoy a few more special moments together, but I respected his decision. I asked him a couple of times to have a 30 min coffee to have a proper in person goodbye. he was vague and suddenly busy so I just got the message and went on with my life. I grieved and listened to sad melancholic music for a month, then started my playboy phase so all great. 

after about a month he started looking at my stories (we don't follow each other and we don't have any mutuals, his is private, mine public) after a while, since in his last text he told me he still considers us friends I thought it was ok to hit follow. I kid you not within 5 minutes my request was rejected. even though I found that a little weird I still respected that and moved on. 

about two months later (after the breakup) I was talking to a friend about my past love stories and adventures, and he asked me to see some pics of my exes, so I looked him up on instagram, only to find out he blocked me. I honestly don't care, but I am genuinely curious to know what you guys think about this. 

story & questions:  some will probably think that he hasn't moved on and to have a new start he needed to not see me again and thus blocked me. this reasoning makes sense, but looking back on his closing behaviour I think I ws more into him than he was into me, so my suspicion was that he had moved on the day he closed the relationship and never thought about it again. but all I am doing (and what you Redditors will do too) is just speculation, so speculate!

Yesterday, we packed up the car for a day trip to an off road camp site for a dear friend‚Äôs birthday. It was about 1.5 hours away and I thought it would be totally fine and easy. I was excited for a nice day out with the family and in nature.
We eventually get about 7km away and a really rough dirt/gravel road was the only way to this ‚Äúcampsite‚Äù. Now we don‚Äôt have the best car, it‚Äôs older but great for the city and carrying all of our baby items. But once we hit this road it started RATTLING and just sounded terrible. My husband who usually said ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine‚Äù when I‚Äôm concerned about something was like ‚Äúthis is not good for the car‚Äù. Then this gravel road goes up the side of a mountain to where the campsite presumably is. I hate heights and I start getting anxious. The car sounds terrible, and all I can think is if we need to leave at a moments notice for my baby, this is a problem. We were talking a very slow time up this hill while other SUVs seemed to be having an ok time. We wanted to go slow so as to minimize the damage to our car. Also our car is not small, it‚Äôs a midsize SUV but again a it‚Äôs older.

Anyway my husband and I made the decision to turn around and leave and go back home. We were so upset because this friend just told us it was a ‚Äúshort gravel road for 5-10 mins‚Äù. It was not that. It felt like serious off-roading. And we were upset because he didn‚Äôt take into consideration that we wanted to bring our baby and that maybe this was more of a serious trip to the campsite than was sold to us. This friend has a history of not properly explaining what to expect and making plans short notice, hence the campsite that was not part of a traditional park, and my husband should know better and ask him more questions (typical men lol) but didn‚Äôt.

Cut to me losing my shit on this friend when he called and told us to turn around. He also said to park the car at the base of this gravel road and he could pick us up. I said that wouldn‚Äôt work because we have to install the car seat in his car. I absolutely lost it. All my patience for this trip and this friend evaporated in the moment. I feel terrible that I yelled at him because it was his birthday weekend and I immediately apologized via text but he again told us to turn around and he would pick us up. I admit I was a bit sleep deprived and anxious from too much coffee too. Throughout this whole thing my baby was fast asleep not making a peep, so she wasn‚Äôt even agitated LOL 
I just feel like I completely lost my shit and I‚Äôm losing it. Anyone ever feel like this?",0,1752943441.0,beyondthebump,2,0.5,False

Posting this again because a bunch of people looked at it and I only got one comment that said you're the asshole and no exclamation for it.

So some months ago i added a friend to my groupchat because i got sick of sending him invites to the party, whenever we played Minecraft. Everyone seemed to like him, because he was quiet so i saw no harm asking.

Little side note, Jordan is his name and we met in this LGBT discord server we are both in. Not important but worth mentioning.

So a few months go by and hes gotten used to the group, he hardly talks to this older member of this group, who i will call Mac. Now Mac had a crush on a friend of ours named Jane. 

She's also in the group and the mother to my best friend who I will call Seer. Now Seer is in college and has been in college for like 2 years now. So me and his mom (Jane) threw up a friendship.

Nothing funny happened, becuase well I'm gay and she's ""sworn off sex."" Not that the latter matters anyway lol. Ok so Mac got over his crush on Jane like 3 years ago, he makes a flirty joke here and there but its over now.

So after a few months of Jordan being in the group he grew attached to Jane and started calling her mommy, every time we played Fallout 76. Everyone hated it, and it made people uncomfortable. Now Mac asked her if she was okay several times in private (Her Ex found out she lives in the UK and he was just checking in to see if she was holding up). 

Now she took this as him being jealous of Jordan and how much time they spend together. They started watching Netflix together, they left the party and started their own to talk more intimately. She even started calling him Cub ü§Æ. Plus she said she would read him my book after I told him he's not allowed to read it. 

Now I take issue with 2 things here. The Netflix thing because I was on her Netflix and since she moved to the UK it hasnt worked properly due to the new household system. Yet she was willing to pay extra for some stranger she met through me less than half a year ago.

Then the book thing because, well its my passion project, she knows this, and I want as little eyes on it as possible.

I would like to state from this point on that I do not hate Trans people. I respect anyone who can find themselves in this crazy world. But this meddler right here can go suck eggs for the events that transpired next.

Im not saying this is all his fault, i know Jane was acting like a dodo bird. Ive known her for 6 plus years and I found how she acted so weird, and not a good weird. 

So eventually someone suggest to Jane that we pkay minecraft since Fallout got ""boring."" Ill give you 3 guesses who suggested it. Moving on were playing minecraft and Jordan is just the worst. He's always complaining he never goes rescource  hunting and he bitches and moans about every minor inconviniunce (I dont think thats how you spell it üò≠) 

Now we've reached the turning point. One Sunday afternoon i wake up and hop on the playstation and ask if anyones getting on. I then got n invite to a seperate party were Darla (Jane's sister) Jordn, Jane, and another friend Jack were in. 

Jack is blind so he doesnt really know how to appear offline but everyone else was. I asked why we were in a seperate party. Jane said she has had enough of Mac and his negativity, and just needed a break from him. Which I understand Mac is a bit aggravating at times but appearing offline and making a seperate party made me feel sick.

Luckily I sas actually sick and faked havinv to go to the hospital and i just stayed off the playstation that day.

So a few days go by and noone other than Jack, Mac,and Grizz (another friend) joined. Jane, Jordan, and Darla, nowhere to be seen.

Then on Thursday she joined and it was just me and her in the party. 

Throughout the week Mac has been messaging the instagram chat and messenger chat asking if everyone is ok? Can we talk about this situation? I feel like we need to. So i talked to Mac and told him that I will see if i can get Darla to talk to Jane and get her to have a conversation with Macand Jordan all together. 

Now me and Jane are in the party and she asks me what do i think of this message Mac sent her. It basically said ""hey i really feel like we should talk, i know your ex is annoying you and i want you to know that as a friend im here if you need to talk. I dont know if Jordan and you are a couple but if you are i hope you know what your doing."" 

(Little thing i forgot to add, she admited to me a week before my birthday, the week this happened, that she has a crush on him and she doesnt know why.)

So she asks me my opinion and i told her several timez. You are not going to like my opinion. She kept sahing its fine, we are friends and we gotta be honest with each other.

So i have a stutering problem which flares up under high anxiety situations(which she knows), and she kept asking me and i kept panicking. But what i got out was i made the point about the Netflix situation and how i really dont care for him anymore. I also pointed out that in some ways its good to see her happier. But she misconstrued what i said.

She left the party shortly after yelling at me while i hd an anxiety attack.

So a day later I called up Darla and she goes off on me, cussing and yelling at me. And i quote ""Why the fuck would you bring up that netflix thing now? Youre on the groupchat netflix?!?! Go apo√±ogize to her right fucking now!!!""

I just agreed with her to get her to stop yelling at me i was beyound annoyed at that point. So seeing as this was first thing in the morning and i was dtill sipping coffee i sent Jane a voice note with a half assed sorry. I admit it was half assed but i was tired and hungover sue me. She hit me with an ""Ok Pietro.""

Now after 6 years of ups and downs, a few of my suicide attempts, my family being shitty, her dealing with her ex's, morning coffe meetups where we would dish and gossip, talk about the newest games and shit, she just gives me ""Ok Pietro.""

I stirred on this for days, within this time Mac said goodbye and left all the groups, i left the insta chat because its Jane's. Jack asked why Mac left and i said some childish shit. Jack asked who was being childish and i said some of the fully grown adults in this group were being childish.

Darla and Jane went off on me, i don't remember what they said and i dont care to anymore. But i got kicked off the group Netflix, Darla and Jane blocked me on all my socials, as if being friends with these people for multiple years meant nothing to them. Oh and Seer no longer joins the group party.

This happened in late April. Last week Jack said Jordan ws no longer in their gc because his ex or baby daddy (he had a kid before transitioning) showed back up in his life. So im assuming Jane got jealous and kicked him from the group. 

Which everyone predicted would happen. 

And ive made the deciscion if she messages me before the year is out im not gonna accept ny apology she may have and i dont wanna be friends with her anymore. But I know im gonna feel like shit for doing it, but its gotta be done, i dont like this side of her and i dont wanna see anymore

So my question is, was i an asshole for how i handeled this situation? Also sorry if this was long üò≠

1m40qjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/fireballdisney/comments/1m40qjq/sharing_things_1/,Sharing things #1,"# Fireball is weird

*Yes*, I'll come right out and say it. Each episode is roughly 1:40 and 2 minutes long, respectively, and they don't even show us what's outside the mansion, nor do they do much to explain the show's story. It's strange because in other normal shows, these questions would be answered in a second or third season, but in the case of Fireball, a fourth season was enough to raise more questions than answers.  
**I'll cut to the chase:** I'll be sharing silly theories I have about Fireball, as *Reisenkrabbe* is literally a series that will be based on these very theories, so it would be helpful for me to share my perspective on certain events that occurred in the series.

***HUMANITY IS DIVIDED*** *^(theory #1)*

I firmly believe, and this is more of an assumption than a theory, that humanity is divided. Their attacks on the Uranus city, *""Tempest City""*, are more than irregular. Humanity attacks frequently, and it's strange how each attack seems unrelated to the next due to the time difference between each attack on the tower. *What do I mean?* That humans have more problems than just the *hyperions*.  
Knowing Disney, and given that Fireball is a comedy with references to it, I wouldn't be surprised if some objected to the decision to attack the hyperions. This is addressed in *Reisenkrabbe*, and it's important because it relates to *Windstille*.

*Although I don't think the division among humanity is the only factor.*

**THERE WERE MORE COUNTRIES THAN URANUS AND YMIR** ^(theory #2)

In the penultimate chapter of Fireball, *Ged√§chtins* mentions that *""Humanity has taken over our international borders.""* This could mean many things.

1. *Humanity has taken over international borders, and therefore, the very countries that separate them.*
2. *Uranus is divided into several walls that separate the city and protect it, and these walls are that ""international border.""*
3. *Uranus had more cities than just Tempest, and humanity destroyed them, leaving only Tempest intact.*

Two of these three options are addressed in *Reisenkrabbe*.  
*~~^(Can you imagine a city on Venus? haha-)~~*

**ST. ELMOS FIRE'S** ^(theory #3)

The title of episode 4 of Fireball (2008) is *""St. Elmo's Fire"".* According to my research *(and all research should be accompanied by a cup of coffee with jazz playing in the background)*, *""*[*St. Elmo's Fire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_fire)*""* refers to a meteorological phenomenon:

>*""When a sharp object passes through a thunderstorm, it creates a corona-shaped electrical discharge.""*

The planet where Fireball is set is very mysterious. It's not Uranus, Saturn, or Mars, and apparently only has one moon. It also seems to have clouds and can even snow.

It's a theory, and the title of this episode could mean more than just this phenomenon, because the first time I looked up the name, it seemed like a **romance drama**. But I wouldn't be surprised if there were sandstorms or thunderstorms on the planet, and if humanity were very wary of this new enemy, the planet they live on.

**THE DEPARTURES FROM WINDSTILLE** ^(Theory #4)

I think the reason Windstille leaves the tower at the same time is closely related to the division of humanity. This is also mentioned in Reisenkrabbe, and one of the few absurd theories I have is that Windstille leaves the tower to talk to humans,not those who are against her, but those who are on her side. Yes, Windstille has spies.

*Although just now, while searching Fireball's Twitter feed, I came across a message from the same creative team explaining why Windstille is leaving the mansion concurrently... for ""the Fl√ºgel family's public works""?*

Well, I guess it was good while it lasted.

BACKGROUND: Me (F20) and my boyfriend (M20) have been together since February after a break. We had been friends or interested in each other since last summer but in November we started seeing each other more since we were both single. We separated in January because of not aligning on some things and just life, and in February we saw each other at a friends wedding and reconnected and said we missed each other and have been together since. 

NOW: Two nights ago I was over at his house talking about how I worry he‚Äôs more friendly with girls than I am with other guys and I had some concerns. I asked to see his phone and he refused which only made my concerns worse and feel like he had something to hide. A couple months ago when I looked at his phone I found text messages with another girl from our break where they were kind of flirting and had hung out but it didn‚Äôt go past that. Because of this he‚Äôs been a little more defensive of his phone and it came to the point that I knew if he didn‚Äôt show me my intuition and fears were correct. I got up to leave and he finally admitted that if I saw his phone I would find texts with a girl that he went to coffee with not even two weeks ago. I blew up. I‚Äôve been cheated on before and lost it. He showed me the texts and promised it was only friendly and he could call her to prove it and she had a bf too but is going to college soon in the UK (we are from USA) and wanted to just say bye. 
Not only that but then when I looked on Instagram I found DMS with his ex from march and that she has been sending him reels up until 9 weeks ago in May. He reached out to her basically because he was having a hard time mentally. The texts weren‚Äôt overly flirty but they were sickening because it was crossing a line and she was the last person he should go to saying things like ‚ÄúIm sorry if you don't want to hear from me but i hope your day is going well. I'm always thinking about you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI know for a fact I probably shouldn't say this but l'm emotionally really beat down right now because of school and I need you. I know how you feel/want me to feel.‚Äù I know these things aren‚Äôt necessarily CHEATING, but they feel the same because it‚Äôs a huge breach of trust and crossing a boundary. 

I thought everything was fine and I can‚Äôt imagine doing this to him. I just feel lost because I don‚Äôt know how he can earn my trust back but this all feels like a bad dream that I haven‚Äôt woken up from. I don‚Äôt want to lose him but I know this isn‚Äôt okay.

ever since I've reached complete safety a few years ago, I've noticed I'm struggling with feeling real, feeling in my body and just realizing how disconnected my mind and body are sometimes.

what are small things that helped you with that?

here's a few things I started doing that improved this issue:

* spending time in front of the mirror! I can't recommend this enough. I really enjoy doing workouts in front of the mirror and watching me move my body, it's so grounding and interesting. or just put on a good song and dance with yourself!
* I also do this when I'm overwhelmed/frustrated/in freeze mode or anything like that. I go to the mirror and talk to myself like ""okay, whats bothering me right now? what can I do to feel better? are my needs met? am I maybe just hungry?"" to defuse the situation. when needed I even do this in a more childish or mother-ly tone, just taking care of me. (I struggle with food so often when I'm spiraling I'm realizing I just haven't ate anything today lol)
* yoga kinda felt good but I still struggle for some reason to do it regularly
* I have some grounding mantras I say to myself sometimes or even put on little notes around my apartment: it's 2025, I'm x years old, I am safe, I am allowed to rest, I am patient with myself, etc.
* I know cold showers can feel great but I also need to work on doing that more regularly üòÖ
* when I'm outside I sometimes put away my headphones and just focus on my senses, what can I smell, hear, see?
* this is just coincidental but someone close to me got a really good phone camera a few months ago and they are taking pictures aaall the time, so every time we meet I have dozens new pictures of me. it's been so interesting to see what I look like while having conversations, laughing, having fun, living life. I try not to judge the way I look because it's all me, I want to love the way I am, so it's just a ""so that's what I look like drinking coffee at a caf√©? thats how the people in my life see me? cool!"". I know this situation isn't easy to replicate but I had to mention that too

He always goes off that I can't clean,as if I have time? I actually watch and play with our child? She doesn't let me wash dishes without screaming, so what do i do.

I am looking for the best machine/grinder combo in the $1000-$1500 range. The goal is to have a reliable set up to replace the >$60 a week currently spent on coffee. I would say 70% of the time the set up would be used for iced lattes, but we do enjoy hot lattes/cappuccinos every now and then (Perhaps even more so if I could make decent ones at home).

Currently I am looking at the Profitech Go and a DF54 (or a Niche if I can land one used at a decent price). Originally was looking at a Gaggi, but was turned off by boilergate (I know they have a new version that apparently resolved it but eh) and prefer the look and extra features of the Go. I also would rather invest in a machine that will last a while (with regular up-keep, of course) rather than something more plastic-y in the 200-500 range.

Also, I know many people argue that spending more on the grinder is important, but I can't seem to find anything cheaper than the Go that seems appealing. Also the fact that we love iced coffee drinks which probably slightly diminishes the importance of the grinder.

Co-ferment, roasted City+. I tried them back then but disliked them so much they ended up buried in the pantry until today.

Lately I‚Äôve been using a Vietnamese Phin filter a lot, and my palate has changed a lot, so I figured I‚Äôd give them a second shot this way.

They‚Äôre three years old now. Grinding them on my K2 took effort - 44 clicks seemed right. 50 flowed too fast.

Straight out of the dripper, it tasted like alcohol-fruit coffee. Fairly acidic, not sour. Not awful, but not my thing. The alcohol taste is quite dominant. Some say it reminds them of a weed ashtray. As someone who doesn‚Äôt smoke but has been around it, I get that.

Then I added 40g of sweetened condensed milk to my 10g:150g brew. Now I'm getting tropical fruit punch iced latte. Surprisingly good. My wife hated it black, and my dad‚Äôs a dark roast guy, but they both liked this sweet iced version.

1m40o5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/neurodiversity/comments/1m40o5z/does_being_neurodivergent_excuse_how_this_man/,Does being neurodivergent excuse how this man treated me? Is this emotional cheating?,"Months ago, I (32f) met a man (35m) I really clicked with at a work event we had both traveled to. We had unusually engaging and deep conversations twice over coffee, during which I also opened up to him about my personal situation ( recently divorced). I did not ask him about his personal circumstances or whether he had someone in his life and he didn‚Äôt volunteer anything either. We just parted ways admitting that we were so happy to have met each other and that we should absolutely not lose touch in the future. 

One thing I noticed when talking to him is that he was a bit different than other people (doesn‚Äôt laugh when others do, can be a bit socially awkward, super intelligent - almost at a genius level, etc.). He later told me he is neurodivergent. I am too (though perhaps not in the same way) and I suspect that this helped us bond in quite a strong and unique way. 

Two weeks later, he sent me a message reminiscing on some past childhood memories from our home country (we both left our country years ago because of the war). I reciprocated with an equally sentimental message, kicking off a 6-months long back and forth letter-writing relationship during which we almost became each other‚Äôs diaries.

The letters (which we would send every three or four days) were emotional, personal, and philosophically/ psychologically dense, but never sexual or romantic. It felt more like we had built a space we both needed to help each other with what we were going through in life. However, he often mentioned how much he ‚Äúadmired me‚Äù, how ‚Äúlucky‚Äù he felt to have met someone like me, how ‚Äúdark‚Äù his life was before I entered it, and how ‚Äúessential‚Äù I had become to him. He said he could not explain our ‚Äúbond‚Äù but that our ‚Äúwriting‚Äù space and my presence in his life was so ‚Äúvital‚Äù to him and his well being.

Naturally, me being a hardcore sapiophile (and a giver/ fixer), I ended up developing feelings for him, although I never thought of asking if he had someone in his life. I did not ask because I was almost embarrassed, because I felt that his answer would certainly be ‚Äúhow can I have a gf/ wife and still write to you the way I do?‚Äù I also felt that if he had someone in his life, he would have put a stop to my writing, which was starting to show a bit more ‚Äúemotion‚Äù and sentimentality over time. So I never asked him. And he never said anything.

Fast forward a few months, as he was telling me again how much he admired me and how rare it was for him to be this impressed by someone for this long, I finally asked him. It wasn‚Äôt a straightforward question, but it was enough for him to get the message: I needed to know.

His answer left me speechless for days. It turned out, not only did he have someone he ‚Äúwas in love with‚Äù in his life. She was also pregnant. He then went on to say that he had told her about me right after meeting me and that she knew about my importance in his life. He said that he would not change a single word or feeling in our correspondence, even if she is to one day read our letters. However, he did admit that he did not show her our conversations because the intimacy in them was as much mine as it was his, and that would ‚Äúnot be right‚Äù.

After I recovered from the initial shock, I wrote back telling him that it was very unfair to keep his gf a secret from the beginning and that even though I never ‚Äúasked‚Äù, he could have at least mentioned her or their future child in his letters at some point. He told me SO many things about his life, his parents, friends, and coworkers‚Ä¶ so how could he have possibly eclipsed the most important person in his life?

I ended my note admitting that I had grown feelings for him along the way and that he had hurt me deeply.  He apologized profusely, saying that hurting me was never the intention, that he never thought I would be interested in knowing about his love life, and that he really only wanted us all (including his gf) to be friends (almost like family) one day, and that he needs me to stay in his life because he has never experienced a bond like ours before and it would be a shame to throw such a beautiful relationship away because of some social norms and ‚Äúshould be‚Äôs‚Äù.

He is even suggesting now introducing me to her. I really do not know what to think of all this and of his reaction (which is making me feel like I am the crazy one here). I don‚Äôt know if he was engaging in a light emotional affair, which he then denied because I told him off, or if he really genuinely only wanted to have a platonic relationship from the beginning.

I know that is he a bit neurodivergent and doesn‚Äôt process and see things the way others do, but I also can‚Äôt help feeling deceived. And I do not know if his neurodivergence is the reason why we both drew two completely different (though both equally intense) impressions from the very same experience.

I really want to be mad at him and walk away but another part of me is wondering if I am overreacting, and if I just allowed myself to fall for something that I imagined, that never really existed. But then again,  I put myself in his gf‚Äôs shoes and think that I would be very upset in her place‚Ä¶ that what he did was hurtful, even if she knew a bit about my existence and importance in his life.

Am I right to feel this way, or AIO? Does his neurodivergence excuse his behavior? Keen to get your views on this!

Detailed Review for Coffee Enthusiasts,"Testing out the NFFTYUUT 1 Cold Brew Coffee Maker was an interesting journey into the magical world of cold brew coffee. As an avid coffee enthusiast, I hold my brewing equipment to a high standard, and this one had some exciting features to explore. It comes with a 64 oz (2 Quart / 1.9 Liter) capacity, durable glass body, a handle, and a stainless steel filter designed specifically for cold brew coffee, iced tea, lemonade, and even homemade fruit drinks. With a sleek design and promises of high functionality, this coffee maker intrigued me right from the packaging.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The durable glass construction of this coffee maker is remarkable. It feels solid, well-made, and not flimsy like some other glass-based containers I‚Äôve used. The handle is ergonomically friendly, making it easy to carry and pour, even when the jar is full to the brim. Its aesthetic appeal also stands out, especially if you want something you wouldn‚Äôt mind having on display in your kitchen. However, the glass is lightweight enough (at 1.11 kilograms) to not be a burden while cleaning, though one may still want to handle it cautiously to avoid cracking or chipping.  

[Check NFFTYUUT 1 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c2btnzz3/)

**Key Functional Features**  
The stainless steel filter lives up to its promise. It‚Äôs fine enough to keep coffee grounds from seeping into the brew, which is crucial for a smooth cold brew experience. I tested it with medium-coarse coffee grounds and was amazed by the clarity of the resulting cold brew ‚Äì no sediment, just a refreshing and flavorful coffee. The lid‚Äôs tight seal ensures no spillages during brewing or when stored in the fridge. The manual setup means you‚Äôre in control, which I personally prefer as it allows for customization based on one‚Äôs taste preferences.

**Merits**  
- The large 64 oz capacity makes it suitable for brewing coffee or other drinks in bulk, which is perfect when hosting guests.  
- Its stainless steel filter works incredibly well, delivering sediment-free coffee.  
- The design is stylish and fits comfortably in most refrigerator spaces.  

**Bad Points**  
- The glass, while durable, may not survive being knocked over onto hard surfaces.  
- The markings for measurements could have been more visible for precise brewing without having to rely on external measuring cups.

**Performance**  
Consistent and reliable results are the main takeaways from my experience. Following a 12-hour steeping process in the refrigerator, the coffee tasted rich, with all the nuanced flavors well-extracted. With lemonade and iced tea, it performed just as impressively, serving as a multipurpose container that goes beyond just coffee. Its versatility really adds to its appeal. However, the recommended 12-hour brew time might be an inconvenience for people looking for quicker coffee fixes.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this product to other popular cold brew coffee makers like the Takeya and the Ovalware RJ3, it holds its own on several fronts. Unlike the Takeya, which relies on plastic bodies, the glass build of the NFFTYUUT cold brew maker feels more premium; however, Takeya offers a slightly more robust lid mechanism. Ovalware RJ3 boasts an even finer filter, but it‚Äôs smaller in capacity, which might not be ideal for big families or heavy coffee drinkers. Each has strengths, but this one fits neatly somewhere between affordability and premium detailing.  

**Value for Money**  
If there‚Äôs one thing that consistently stood out to me during testing, it‚Äôs the cost efficiency of this coffee maker. Compared to higher-end cold brew makers that offer similar capacities and features, this one delivers exceptional performance at a more accessible price point. While no exact numbers can be quoted, I can firmly say that it feels worth every penny, given its functionality and overall design.

Just trying to look to make some genuine friendships preferably with other women around my age! It‚Äôs been hard meeting people now that I‚Äôm out of school, and I‚Äôd really love to have a few people to talk to, hang out with, or even make some Halloween plans with. üéÉ

A bit about me:

I love drawing and chilling on Xbox (mostly Minecraft but open to trying new games if you want to play together!)
I‚Äôm super into anime ‚Äî stuff like Soul Eater, Ouran High School Host Club, Hellsing, etc.
I‚Äôm also obsessed with horror and anything Halloween/spooky-related: scary movies, witchy vibes, haunted houses ‚Äî all of it. (Just don‚Äôt put a spell on me, okay? üòÖ)
I‚Äôm the type who randomly brings up FNaF lore or just yap about anything really:3
I‚Äôm just hoping to find some chill, fun people to vibe with ‚Äî maybe grab coffee, go thrifting, binge some creepy shows, or plan something festive for October üñ§

DM me or comment if you‚Äôre in the area and feel like we might click! I'd love to meet some new faces ‚ò∫Ô∏èüßá

1m40hyk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m40hyk,Living room advice,"Trying to work out how best to furnish the living room. I'm thinking to place the sofa under where the mirror currently is, that table is being chucked out and needs replacing. You can see the light blue I'm redoing the walls in because the yellow lighting on magnolia gave a yellow feeling that honestly gave me headaches.
Current thought is to have the sofa as shown in my low quality markup facing the TV on a stand in some IKEA cabinets that come up flush to the wall of the door. Then cabinets over the top of the TV too, a coffee table in front of the TV, full size table in the corner to the right when facing the kitchen, and a mix of open shelving/closed cupboards for storage under the alcove.
Photos 5 and 6 show the inspiration for what I was thinking in IKEA, 5 for what I might put above/below the TV, and 6 the colour billy I'd use for the storage in the alcove and to the left/right of the TV.",1,1752942660.0,DesignMyRoom,1,0.67,False

Almost through my prednisone pack (someone here noted that won‚Äôt help and that I shouldn‚Äôt stretch?), and been taking muscle relaxers to no avail. Beyond the trip, I‚Äôm absolutely dreading the 7-8 hours flight back home next week.

Got a deep tissue massage yesterday to no relief. Have a chiropractor appt for where I‚Äôm at on Monday.  Do I call my home dr and see if he can send a prescription here? Urgent care or ER for stronger meds?",1,1752942641.0,Sciatica,3,1.0,False
