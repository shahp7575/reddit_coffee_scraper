1lq8sub,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1lq8sub/espresso_addicts_i_built_an_app_to_help_dial_in/,"Espresso addicts, I built an app to help dial in and track your shots","Hey folks,

I’ve been working on a free [iOS app called Dial In](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dial-in-coffee/id6746680844), designed to help you log and improve your espresso shots.

Here’s what **Dial In** offers right now:

    •✅ Quick shot logging (dose, yield, time, grinder setting, notes)
    
    •✅ Instant feedback based on traditional brew ratios or your personal history
    
    •✅ Easy tracking of how your shots evolve across beans, grinders, and days
    
    •✅ A lightweight UI built for speed — no accounts or clunky onboarding

**What makes it different from other apps:**

    •A lot of the current tools either feel dated, require full barista-level knowledge to even get started, or overload you with unnecessary features.
    
    •Dial In is **designed for people in the middle zone** — beyond beginner, not quite home roast god — who want to improve with less friction.
    
    •It’s mobile-first, minimalist, and works out of the box — no integrations or fancy gear required.

**What’s coming soon:**

    •🔜 Preinfusion and pressure profiling support
    
    •🔜 Multi-device syncing + export
    
    •🔜 A **beginner walkthrough** to help folks new to espresso avoid overwhelm
    
    •🔜 **Latte art analysis + guidance** using your camera
    
    •🔜 Community features (sharing shot logs, comparing extractions, etc.)

Would love your feedback — whether that’s “This sucks, just use a notebook” or “This could actually help me dial in faster.” I’m not trying to sell anything (it’s 100% free), just hoping to make it better with input from people who actually care about espresso.

Here’s the [App Store link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dial-in-coffee/id6746680844) if you’re on iOS and want to try it.",2,1751493998.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

1lq8rxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1lq8rxe/years_of_friendship_two_nights_of_passion_and_a/,"Years of friendship, two nights of passion, and a lifetime of affection","Dear M,

The two nights we spent together all those years ago still dance through my memory. In that moment, you were perfect in every way for me. You were everything I needed, even though I didn’t know it. I hope you feel something similar about me. 


I hope you’re doing well. I want you to know that for so many years, I thought about you often. It’s funny how we were in school together for six years and hardly knew each other, but then, for such a brief little moment, we saw each other, probably in ways that few people ever had. It wasn’t just our bodies that lay naked together, but our whole selves were opened up to each other. I added it up, and I think we spent about thirty-six hours together. Thirty-six hours over pieces of four days and two nights over the course of nearly a month in two countries. Thirty-six hours in some sort of cocoon or bubble where the rest of the world was so distant from us, and the whole universe was limited to what fell within our senses.  We were without context. Insulated from everyone we knew and everything we might have thought or assumed about each other for years. Seeing without filters. I still remember how you looked, how you felt, and even how you smelt and tasted and the sound of your voice in my ear. 


All of a sudden, you weren’t that popular girl or the smartest girl in our algebra class. You weren’t C’s little sister or J’s ex-girlfriend; you were just you. And I’m glad I finally saw you. 


It’s easy to think that I only saw you differently because we slept together. Don’t get me wrong, the sex rocked my world, but if I’m being honest, that wasn’t what moved me. It only took about an hour for me to feel drawn to you in a way that was unnerving. When I saw you, I almost didn’t even say anything because I wasn’t sure it was really you. Because what were the odds, really? But I called out your name and watched as you started looking through the crowd for a familiar face. And then the recognition and confusion I’d felt a moment before scrolled across your eyes. And then I saw your smile and felt that same smile on my face. And then a hug. Not a shoulder tap or a friendly side hug, but a full-bodied embrace. A quick subway ride and a walk to your neighborhood cafe and a cup of coffee that took a lot longer to drink than it should have. A real conversation after years of “hey” and “did you finish the homework.” I guess part of it was that, even though we were really still kids in so many ways, I was seeing you as an adult. Independent. We were our own people, figuring out who we really were, not characters that had to fit within a certain set of stereotypes. This wasn’t a tv show. It was just life. One cup of coffee, and it’s like the mist was gone, and I saw you. And honestly, I really got a kick out of sharing a cigarette with you for the first time. That was the true “the guys back home would never believe this” moment. 

I didn't have any clue I was going to kiss you until we were sitting in your bed and our lips were touching. Even walking to your flat, the only thing on my mind was that it was nice to have you as a friend. I just didn’t have a concept of you as a lover. I mean, I’d fantasized about you at some point for sure. All the guys did. But realistically, that version of you didn’t exist in my concept of the universe. And then, as unexpectedly as anything I’ve ever experienced, you became my lover. I didn’t have time to consider what the people back home would think or believe about it. Because those people just didn’t exist in this new world we created for ourselves. 


Being with you was like falling forward into a memory. Everything was so familiar and yet so new at the same time. The person I’d know and even pictured in my imagination was so different from the person I held in my arms. You were both comfortable and nerve-wracking. You brought both clarity and confusion. As Dickens wrote, “It was the epoch of belief; it was the epoch of incredulity.” But you were there, and you were real, and I experienced an eternity of you in a single moment. 


There is no way to describe how good it felt being with you. The warmth and softness of your touch. The wetness of your kiss on my lips and on my body. The feast you provided for all my senses. The beauty in your eyes and the raw eroticism of your body as it moved against mine. The charged connection when we were coupled together, our bodies melding into one another, intertwining, engulfing, absorbing each other. You were, in a word, otherworldly. 


I feel like our little affair, in some ways, may have been the healthiest relationship I’ve ever had. It was so much more than a hookup. We went through so many emotions in such a short period of time. We saw and heard each other. We acknowledged and supported each other. We took each other to the heights of ecstasy and held each other in quiet moments. My admiration and respect for you grew exponentially, as did my affection. And then we said goodbye without hurting each other. There’s something almost sacred about that, and it’s stayed with me all these years later. 


I don’t know what kind of impact our time together had on you overall, but I know it had some. I saw your mother a few years later, and she mentioned that you kept that picture of us at the train station on your dresser until they sold the house a few years later. She also said you were married with two kids, living in Pennsylvania. I hope to everything holy that means that you’ve found the life and love and happiness you deserve. Just like I hope that the time we spent together was what you needed in that moment and that I made you feel the happiness and love that you needed then and that you were able to carry it with you. 


Love is a funny word to use I guess, but it’s definitely possible to love somebody without it being “like that.” And I did grow to love you in those few hours. Not a silly schoolboy crush that was mistaken for love, but an appreciation of who you are and gratefulness that you shared part of your life with me. I knew I’d care for you and feel that affection for you forever, even though I’d never touch your body again. I think that counts as love, because I don’t know what else to call it. It might even be a purer form of love than a lot of longer relationships yield. And it’s still there, unspoiled and unspoken. 


I’m also grateful that you saw me for who I was. I still don’t know what you thought of me before. You said you knew I was smart but quiet. You didn’t say it, but I know I also had a reputation for being a little rough around the edges just because I was from the wrong side of the tracks. Maybe you’d already seen through that, maybe not. But as far as I know, you were the first person from among our peers who discovered that I was sentimental and actually had a romantic streak. That’s something that others have expressed surprise over in later years, but you were the first to pull me out of my shell in that regard. It was easy to want to show you that though. Not just because I wanted to impress you. But because you actively appreciated and validated it. When you came to Rome, it was tempting to just try to take you straight to a hotel and get you back in bed. But there was no way I could reduce you to a sexual conquest. I guess because I was already conquered by you. 


I do wish I could tell you all this without it being awkward. It’s a shame that we lost touch the way we did, but also, in some way, it’s probably for the best because it let us leave our time together undisturbed. As you discovered my sentimental nature, it may come as no surprise to you that I still have your necklace that you gave to me, along with what’s left of the pressed carnation and a lot of lines and a few sketches in my notebook about you. I dug them out this week after thinking about you. Part of me wanted to make sure it was real and not something I’d imagined, I guess. Part of me just wanted to feel the warmth of your touch again, and, strangely, I did. I only feel good emotions when I think about you. Only sweetness, no sadness. That’s not something I can say about very many women. Maybe it’s the most unconventional loves that stand the test of time. 


At any rate, wherever you are now, I hope you are having an amazing life. I’m certain I’m just a distant memory, and that’s the way it should be. But I hope that every now and then you remember me and feel the warmth of my arms around you in that moment. I, for one, am content to know that I once made the world a more beautiful place because I made you smile. 


Affectionately yours,
S

1lq8rh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodLosAngeles/comments/1lq8rh4/101_california_classic_restaurants/,101 California Classic Restaurants,"Hey LA,

So the LA Times put out their 101 “Best” Restaurants in California list last month, and I have MANY thoughts. I think many of us can agree that the 101 Best in LA list has declined in quality since Jonathan Gold passed. What was once a product of a singular vision that balanced cutting edge fine dining with family owned hidden gems has trended more and more toward buzzy chef driven places over the years. I think we need an antidote to what the 101 Lists have become.

You can read more about my thoughts on that [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/dinertheory/p/newsletter-5-why-i-hate-the-la-times?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=2bzxl3). But basically, I decided there should be kind of an “anti-LA Times” list. Something that showcased traditional, regional California cuisine. This isn’t what I think is “the best,” just a guide to places that I think have something unique to say about California, places that can’t be found anywhere else and have been around so long they're part of the fabric of their community. I will be expanding my thoughts and reasoning behind each place on my Substack, but I’m interested to hear thoughts on the basic form of the list. So, without further ado…

Hey everyone!

I'm part of a small instrumental math rock band from Chile called **enlaces**, and we just released our **new single**: *avocado*.

The song blends playful melodies with some unexpected turns, and it was written thinking about those warm, everyday moments you share with the people you love — like cutting an avocado and chatting while the coffee brews (yes, seriously).

i’ve tried discord and online spaces a lot in the past, but they never really worked for me. so many folks are seeking huge webs of mutual support and i'm just… not that person. i can’t juggle dozens of connections, and i don’t expect anyone else to either. i just want a simple, honest, caring circle of adults to share life with. coffee shop hangs. movie nights. occasional dinners. random texts. shopping. small stuff that actually means something.

i’m a good cook—think homemade pasta, grilled steak, baked cookies when i have the energy. i’ll absolutely feed you if you’re kind. i don’t smoke (420-friendly but not for me personally), but i do enjoy a good glass of smoky whiskey or a lovely red wine now and then.

if you're looking for something warm, small, and real—something platonic and rooted in mutual care—i’d love to meet you.

right now i am mostly an internet person since i'm recovering from surgery, so discord's kind of it for me rn. i've been super disconnected for the past few months and family’s shadow of loneliness has been creeping in these first few weeks of recovery. discord, texting, facebook even (yuck), lmk.

1lq8hlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1lq8hlv/years_of_friendship_two_nights_of_passion_and_a/,"Years of friendship, two nights of passion, and a lifetime of affection","Dear M,

The two nights we spent together all those years ago still dance through my memory. In that moment, you were perfect in every way for me. You were everything I needed, even though I didn’t know it. I hope you feel something similar about me. 


I hope you’re doing well. I want you to know that for so many years, I thought about you often. It’s funny how we were in school together for six years and hardly knew each other, but then, for such a brief little moment, we saw each other, probably in ways that few people ever had. It wasn’t just our bodies that lay naked together, but our whole selves were opened up to each other. I added it up, and I think we spent about thirty-six hours together. Thirty-six hours over pieces of four days and two nights over the course of nearly a month in two countries. Thirty-six hours in some sort of cocoon or bubble where the rest of the world was so distant from us, and the whole universe was limited to what fell within our senses.  We were without context. Insulated from everyone we knew and everything we might have thought or assumed about each other for years. Seeing without filters. I still remember how you looked, how you felt, and even how you smelt and tasted and the sound of your voice in my ear. 


All of a sudden, you weren’t that popular girl or the smartest girl in our algebra class. You weren’t C’s little sister or J’s ex-girlfriend; you were just you. And I’m glad I finally saw you. 


It’s easy to think that I only saw you differently because we slept together. Don’t get me wrong, the sex rocked my world, but if I’m being honest, that wasn’t what moved me. It only took about an hour for me to feel drawn to you in a way that was unnerving. When I saw you, I almost didn’t even say anything because I wasn’t sure it was really you. Because what were the odds, really? But I called out your name and watched as you started looking through the crowd for a familiar face. And then the recognition and confusion I’d felt a moment before scrolled across your eyes. And then I saw your smile and felt that same smile on my face. And then a hug. Not a shoulder tap or a friendly side hug, but a full-bodied embrace. A quick subway ride and a walk to your neighborhood cafe and a cup of coffee that took a lot longer to drink than it should have. A real conversation after years of “hey” and “did you finish the homework.” I guess part of it was that, even though we were really still kids in so many ways, I was seeing you as an adult. Independent. We were our own people, figuring out who we really were, not characters that had to fit within a certain set of stereotypes. This wasn’t a tv show. It was just life. One cup of coffee, and it’s like the mist was gone, and I saw you. And honestly, I really got a kick out of sharing a cigarette with you for the first time. That was the true “the guys back home would never believe this” moment. 

I didn't have any clue I was going to kiss you until we were sitting in your bed and our lips were touching. Even walking to your flat, the only thing on my mind was that it was nice to have you as a friend. I just didn’t have a concept of you as a lover. I mean, I’d fantasized about you at some point for sure. All the guys did. But realistically, that version of you didn’t exist in my concept of the universe. And then, as unexpectedly as anything I’ve ever experienced, you became my lover. I didn’t have time to consider what the people back home would think or believe about it. Because those people just didn’t exist in this new world we created for ourselves. 


Being with you was like falling forward into a memory. Everything was so familiar and yet so new at the same time. The person I’d know and even pictured in my imagination was so different from the person I held in my arms. You were both comfortable and nerve-wracking. You brought both clarity and confusion. As Dickens wrote, “It was the epoch of belief; it was the epoch of incredulity.” But you were there, and you were real, and I experienced an eternity of you in a single moment. 


There is no way to describe how good it felt being with you. The warmth and softness of your touch. The wetness of your kiss on my lips and on my body. The feast you provided for all my senses. The beauty in your eyes and the raw eroticism of your body as it moved against mine. The charged connection when we were coupled together, our bodies melding into one another, intertwining, engulfing, absorbing each other. You were, in a word, otherworldly. 


I feel like our little affair, in some ways, may have been the healthiest relationship I’ve ever had. It was so much more than a hookup. We went through so many emotions in such a short period of time. We saw and heard each other. We acknowledged and supported each other. We took each other to the heights of ecstasy and held each other in quiet moments. My admiration and respect for you grew exponentially, as did my affection. And then we said goodbye without hurting each other. There’s something almost sacred about that, and it’s stayed with me all these years later. 


I don’t know what kind of impact our time together had on you overall, but I know it had some. I saw your mother a few years later, and she mentioned that you kept that picture of us at the train station on your dresser until they sold the house a few years later. She also said you were married with two kids, living in Pennsylvania. I hope to everything holy that means that you’ve found the life and love and happiness you deserve. Just like I hope that the time we spent together was what you needed in that moment and that I made you feel the happiness and love that you needed then and that you were able to carry it with you. 


Love is a funny word to use I guess, but it’s definitely possible to love somebody without it being “like that.” And I did grow to love you in those few hours. Not a silly schoolboy crush that was mistaken for love, but an appreciation of who you are and gratefulness that you shared part of your life with me. I knew I’d care for you and feel that affection for you forever, even though I’d never touch your body again. I think that counts as love, because I don’t know what else to call it. It might even be a purer form of love than a lot of longer relationships yield. And it’s still there, unspoiled and unspoken. 


I’m also grateful that you saw me for who I was. I still don’t know what you thought of me before. You said you knew I was smart but quiet. You didn’t say it, but I know I also had a reputation for being a little rough around the edges just because I was from the wrong side of the tracks. Maybe you’d already seen through that, maybe not. But as far as I know, you were the first person from among our peers who discovered that I was sentimental and actually had a romantic streak. That’s something that others have expressed surprise over in later years, but you were the first to pull me out of my shell in that regard. It was easy to want to show you that though. Not just because I wanted to impress you. But because you actively appreciated and validated it. When you came to Rome, it was tempting to just try to take you straight to a hotel and get you back in bed. But there was no way I could reduce you to a sexual conquest. I guess because I was already conquered by you. 


I do wish I could tell you all this without it being awkward. It’s a shame that we lost touch the way we did, but also, in some way, it’s probably for the best because it let us leave our time together undisturbed. As you discovered my sentimental nature, it may come as no surprise to you that I still have your necklace that you gave to me, along with what’s left of the pressed carnation and a lot of lines and a few sketches in my notebook about you. I dug them out this week after thinking about you. Part of me wanted to make sure it was real and not something I’d imagined, I guess. Part of me just wanted to feel the warmth of your touch again, and, strangely, I did. I only feel good emotions when I think about you. Only sweetness, no sadness. That’s not something I can say about very many women. Maybe it’s the most unconventional loves that stand the test of time. 


At any rate, wherever you are now, I hope you are having an amazing life. I’m certain I’m just a distant memory, and that’s the way it should be. But I hope that every now and then you remember me and feel the warmth of my arms around you in that moment. I, for one, am content to know that I once made the world a more beautiful place because I made you smile. 


Affectionately yours,
S

Lily and Rose are basically a due that have been friends since elementary school or further im not entirely sure. Sunny was also friend with Rose from elementary or middle school. I came along in high school. We were good friends but after high school and college things kinda got messy. 

I was talking to this guy my friends didn’t like and when they saw me texting him one time they took my phone from me, grabbed my shoulder and Rose had grabbed my face to make me look at Lily and Lily basically talked down on me like how dare I still talk to him and im a idiot for doing so. I didn’t take this well since I grew up in a mentally abusive home. I tried to explain to them that my feelings were hurt but they kind of made a joke out of it. 

I then confronted them and told them I didn’t like how they spoke to me but I understood they were coming from a place of love. I just didn’t like them talking down on me. Lily was just like “Yeah no.” And Rose was like “Sorry have a good life bye.” And I just walked away. Sunny was off at a different college at this time so I’m not sure if she was aware about it. 

A year later I caught Rose in a class and I grew the courage to speak to her after class. So I said hi and we chatted over coffee and snacks. We did hang out a few times after that and we addressed what happened and she didn’t really apologize but I was just glad to have my friend back. Later Lily asked to hang out and we all did. We talked about the situation and we laughed and hung out and spoke almost everyday after that. 

Then later the texts from the slowed down, they wouldn’t pick up my calls and id basically be talking to myself in the group chat. The only really message I got was a single happy birthday text from each of them in the group chat. I didn’t get any gifts from them or had them come over to see me, which I didn’t think much of until later. When a family member of mine got cancer they were the first to know. Sunny and Lily comforted me a little bit but after that radio silence.

I was able to get them to hang out back in late March or early April and I asked them if they were avoiding me. They basically danced around the question and said that I always had something going on and they needed a break from me. I told them next time please tell me bc I thought I did something wrong. Turns out Rose didn’t even know my family member had cancer bc she admitted she stopped reading the group chat a while ago. I even joked about not getting a birthday gift and said “Hey so where’s my birthday gift?” And Rose just replied “Good question.” And her and Lily just laughed it off. I felt a bit hurt bc I came to Rose’s birthday party, helped plan one for Lily, and came out with Sunny for her birthday but all I got was a single text? I even paid for the lunch we got, they did send me the money for their part but I guess I was kind of hoping to get a surprise meal.

I always kind of felt left out bc Lily and rose would always plan trips of the just the two of them. Once they went to Disney and I didn’t even know they went until a few days before their flight and I asked if I could go and they said it was a last minute thing so they didn’t plan for any extra people, another time I found out they had planned a trip to puerto Rico together and I didn’t know until they were already there. Later I found out they were planning a trip in August and I wasn’t aware of it. I wasn’t sure if Sunny was aware of the trips also but she was busy in college a lot so she rarely texted the group chat or picked up calls because she was always studying. 

I guess they kind of did the whole “I hope she gets the hint.” thing they do in the movies I guess. It just hurt. I stopped reaching out to see if anyone would text or call me first and nobody did. I would see them active on socials or posting videos and I’d like their videos but they would just view mine or never like any of my posts etc. not that it’s a big deal to me but it just feels weird if I posted something the same day Lily did and everyone would praise her in the comments and I’d never get anything. 

I feel like they hate me and I wanted to confront but realized there is no point because they probably made the decision to drop me together and just decided to leave me out of it.

I feel sad but I should just move on right?

I’m a long-time Swatch lover who also enjoys the calm side of tech. I’ve been day-dreaming about a *truly* minimal Swatch smartwatch and wanted to float the idea here to see what you think.

# Why this could be special

* **Screen-free serenity** No buzzing display, no doomscroll temptation, just an oldschool Swatch dial. Notifications stay on your phone so your wrist stays peaceful.
* **Gentle haptic alarm** Think of a soft morning tap instead of a blaring ringtone. Great for early risers who don’t want to wake the whole house (or train carriage).
* **Basic fitness tracking** Steps, distance, heartrate, maybe simple sleep insights. Enough to keep you moving without drowning you in data you’ll never check twice.
* **Swatch Pay built-in** Tap-to-pay has been part of Swatch for a while, so it feels right at home here, no extra wallet, no flashy NFC animations.
* **Swatch DNA** Fun colors, affordable price, quartz reliability, and those delightfully light cases we all know.

# The upside of “less”

I love full-featured smartwatches, but sometimes I just want the *time*, a nudge to stand up, and the option to buy coffee without my phone. This concept keeps everything else out of sight and out of mind—letting your day feel simpler.

# Curious to hear your thoughts!

Would you wear something like this? What key feature would *you* add or drop? I’d love to bounce ideas around, maybe someone at Swatch is listening. 👐",1,1751492844.0,swatch,0,1.0,False

My current job title aligns with the role, but different business sector, so there was a lot of different terminology and questions back and forth for clarification on specific processes. 

At the end, the interviewer said, “I have a question I always ask, it might seem off the wall, there’s no right or wrong answer. How many cups of coffee are drank in the U.S. per day?”

I have won contests by guessing things like this. I amaze my partner on the regular by guessing things like this. I took a few seconds and said, “500 million?”

She raised her eyebrows, then said, “I don’t know the answer” … lmao why ask then?

So I looked it up online and the estimate was 517 million.

I’m a 22-year-old woman living in Duskfield, Montana. Another grueling shift at Kitty’s Café, a tired, run-down little restaurant, finally comes to an end. My feet ache as I gather my things, the weight of the day settling into my shoulders. I’m bone-tired, more than usual, but at least it’s over. I walk toward my car, the dull glow of the streetlights casting long shadows on the pavement. The chill in the air feels more biting now, and I feel like something or someone is watching me.

My old, beat-up car sits under a dim light, its paint chipped, its engine a constant reminder of how little I have. But it’s mine, and I’m grateful for it. Still, as I approach, the sensation that I’m being watched crawls along the back of my neck. I glance around, half expecting to see someone lurking in the shadows, but the street is deserted, as it always is at this hour. I try to shake it off. Maybe it’s just my paranoia—I've always had a tendency to overthink things—but the feeling stays, like a cold hand on my spine, an unsettling presence that won’t let go. I slide into the driver’s seat, my hands gripping the wheel tighter than usual. The car groans to life, and I pull out of the parking lot, but even as the headlights cut through the dark, that nagging feeling lingers, refusing to let go. I look in the rearview mirror, and for a second, I swear I see someone moving in the distance, a shadow darting just out of sight. I tell myself it’s nothing. I’ve just worked a long shift. But as I drive through the empty streets, the night feels suffocating in its silence. The strange feeling I can’t shake is like a weight in my chest, heavy and persistent, tugging at my thoughts. Something’s wrong. I just can’t figure out what.

I arrive at my house where my grandma greets me with my favorite dinner. “Vera, I made spaghetti carbonara! It’s on the table for you.” She says. “It’s amazing!” My aunt exclaims with a mouth full. I smile and thank her and take it up to my room. When I get to my room, I notice the door is open. Weird. I swear I locked it. Didn’t I? Maybe I’m just forgetting things.  I ask my family about it, but they insist it’s always locked. “Are you sure you locked it, honey? Maybe you’re just forgetting.” My grandma says, trying to reassure me. But her words make me doubt myself. Maybe I am losing my mind. I sit at my vanity with my dinner, trying to shake the thought from my head. Then it hits me—tonight’s girls' night! I hurry and eat then I get ready to go out.  I Uber to the bar to meet my friends.

By the time I arrive, it's almost 10 p.m. I’m always the first one here, sitting at the bar waiting. That’s when he sits down next to me. A man named John. He’s a very attractive man with short brown hair, a stocky build, and stands about 5’9.

""I’ve seen you here before, haven’t I? You work long shifts, huh? I can always tell by the look in your eyes. You’re tired. But still, you’ve got this… energy. Something about you is different. I like that."" He says.

“Yeah, I guess I work a lot. It’s kind of exhausting, but you get used to it.” I reply, looking around for my friends. He offers to buy me a drink, I’m unsure about taking drinks from strangers so I shoot him an unsure look.

“I don’t bite, you know. I’m just here to help you relax. I can see how hard you’re working. I’m just here for a little company, too. It’s just a drink… What’s the harm? One drink, and I’ll disappear before your girlfriends get here. We’ll make sure it’s a good night for you. No one will judge you for wanting a little fun, right?”

 As the night wears on, the buzzing excitement of the bar suddenly begins to blur. John’s conversation is starting to feel distant, muffled as if I'm hearing it from underwater. My vision flickers, like I'm watching a scene through frosted glass. At first, I think it’s just the alcohol—the casual buzz creeping in—but something doesn’t feel right. It’s different. My thoughts don’t string together the way they normally do. They slip and slide, like trying to catch water with your bare hands. I blink hard, trying to focus, but the room feels like it’s tilting, and a strange fog starts settling into my mind, thick and unrelenting. I try to steady myself, shifting my weight on the barstool, but it’s as if gravity’s playing tricks on me, pulling me down in a way I can’t fight. My limbs feel heavier than usual, sluggish, like I’m wading through syrup. The dizziness hits hard now, a cold panic spreading through my chest. My heart starts to race, and my palms go clammy.

 

Why am I so dizzy?

 

Then the thought hits me. How did he know that I was waiting for my friends?

 

My stomach churns uneasily, and I place a hand on it, trying to quell the unease. Something’s off. The world feels too big, too loud, too fast. My tongue feels thick in my mouth. I can’t swallow right. I try to push the thought away, but it's like a whisper growing into a scream in the back of my mind.

 

Did he do this? Did he spike my drink?

 

The realization crashes over me with brutal clarity. A wave of icy terror floods my veins. The world is spinning faster now, uncontrollable. The walls start to close in. I fight it, try to stand, but my legs feel like they’re made of rubber. I barely make it a step before they give out, and I grab onto the bar for support. I can’t breathe. My chest feels tight, constricted, as if I’ve been shoved underwater. The realization that I’ve been drugged doesn't settle slowly, but crashes into me all at once, like falling from a great height, the ground beneath me suddenly gone. Panic grips my throat as my mind starts to scatter. Is he still here? What is he planning? How could I have been so stupid? How could I not have noticed? Where are my friends? I want to scream, to shout, to ask for help, but my voice feels lost, swallowed by the fog in my mind. My thoughts are breaking apart, jagged, disjointed, as if someone has scrambled them all up. I can’t even think straight. What’s happening to me? What have I done? Why can’t I move? Why can’t I stop him? Where are my friends?

The panic surges again, but it's like a dull roar in my ears. The adrenaline kicks in, desperate, pushing me to act—to run—but my body doesn’t respond. It’s as though it’s not mine anymore. My fingers tremble uncontrollably as I try to focus, try to remember the steps, the way to move, to escape.

 

But it’s too late.

 

His hand is on my shoulder. My blood runs cold. Then everything shoots to black.

 

 

 

 

When I wake up, I’m in his car, my head foggy, and my mind racing. I see my house in the distance. How does he know where I live?

Panic surges through me. I run inside and scream for help, my voice cracking as I call for my family. The silence that follows is suffocating. They have to be home—they HAVE to hear me. But what if they don’t? What if no one can stop him?

Just as I’m losing hope, my aunt and grandma rush down the stairs. I flash a stare at John while he walks through the front door.  John’s fingers graze the gun at his waist. He doesn’t pull it out, but the movement is chilling—his mind already made up. My family tries to help, but it’s too late. Two shots ring out, and my aunt and grandma fall, blood staining the floor. John wipes the blood off his hands, coldly, as if it’s nothing. I want to vomit, but I can’t look away. If this isn’t the first time, it won’t be the last.

His grip on my arm is iron, unyielding as he drags me out of the house. I can smell the stale cigarettes on his breath as he pulls me toward the car, the gravel crunching beneath my feet. It feels like a dream, the nightmarish kind. John shoves me toward his trunk, but somehow, I break free and run. I don’t look back, just push my legs harder, faster. The street is eerily silent, the dim lights casting long shadows, stretching like fingers reaching for me. I can hear my breath, sharp and ragged in the stillness, each step echoing like it’s the last. I stop to listen. Was he gone? A shadow at the end of the street tells me he’s still there, closing in with slow, deliberate steps.

As the dizziness grows again, my legs go weak and I fall to the ground. I try to get up again. But the moment my feet hit the floor, my legs buckle beneath me. It’s as if the ground itself is pulling me down, dragging me into the abyss. I stagger, trying to steady myself, but everything is spinning—his voice, the lights, the people—everything blurs into one chaotic mess. My heart is pounding in my chest now, each beat an echo of the fear that’s rising in me. My feet are leaden, unresponsive, and before I can catch my balance, my knees give way.

The cold concrete of the sidewalk slams into me. Hard. A sharp sting shoots through my palms as I scrape against the rough surface. I gasp, the air knocked out of my lungs. My legs are still numb, shaking uncontrollably, and my head spins in slow, dizzying circles. For a moment, I can’t even move. The pain in my hands is distant, far away compared to the terror clawing at my insides. I try to push myself up, but it’s like the world is pushing back—pushing me down, holding me in place. My vision wavers, flickering like a broken light, and I know I’m running out of time.

 

I need to get up. I need to run.

 

And then, I hear it…

 

Footsteps. Heavy, deliberate. They're closing in, too close. I try to scream, to call out for help, but my throat feels thick and strangled. My breath is coming in short, shallow gasps. His shadow looms over me.

 

John.

 

He stands over me with a deranged smile that makes me feel sick all over again. “Get up.” He insists. But as I try to stand, my body betrays me again. The world tilts, and before I can even react, I crash back down to the pavement. My hands scrape against the rough concrete again as I try to push myself off, but it feels like I’m moving in slow motion. Every part of me screams to run, but my limbs are uncooperative. Everything feels heavy—my head, my body, my soul. He’s still standing over me. He roughly grabs me by the arm and picks me up off the cold pavement. “Run.” He calmy says. I somehow get the strength back and run for my life.

I cut through someone’s backyard, hoping to lose him. I find a window and slip inside. The house is musty, stale with the scent of damp wood and a faint trace of cigarette smoke. Someone had been here recently—but who? I crouch in the bathroom, heart hammering in my chest. The silence is deafening. I can’t stop shaking. My dry mouth is like dust, the bitter taste of fear on my tongue. My fingers tremble as I brush over the rough surface of the wall. Every creak of the floorboards outside feels like a warning.

Minutes seem to stretch into hours, and I quietly move out of the bathroom. The stillness of the house is unnatural. Something isn’t right. I find a phone on a coffee table, sweat slicking my palms as I fumble to dial 911. My heart pounds in my ears, drowning out everything else. The room spins, but I push through, trying to stay calm.

Then, a noise—soft at first—creaking behind me. I spin around, but there’s nothing. The silence is thick, like it’s pressing in on me. I hear something in the kitchen, the sound of a pan sizzling. The smell reaches me first, like a sharp, metallic stench that cuts through the air.  I can feel it in the back of my throat, coating it with a bitter taste, like burnt oil and something... awful. Something raw, something wrong.

I creep down the hallway, and through the open door, I see an old man on the floor, face down in a pool of blood. This must be the poor homeowner. His calf is missing a chunk of flesh.

I step back into the kitchen, my heart hammering in my chest. The first thing I see is the pan on the stove—hot and crackling with heat. The meat inside is searing, turning brown, the edges curling and crisping. The sound of it—sizzling, bubbling—is like an eerie whisper, a constant reminder of what’s happening. But I can’t pull my eyes away from it. I feel like I should, but something keeps me rooted to the pan. It’s not the meat itself that stops me. It’s the thought of the old man. The way he lay crumpled on the floor. His body twisted and lifeless, the pool of blood spreading beneath him. But there’s something else—something that pulls at the back of my mind.

I look again, eyes shifting from the pan to the old man’s body. The sight of his mutilated leg sends a cold wave of dread straight through me. His calf has been torn. A jagged wound stretches across the exposed muscle. And it’s not just cut. No. There’s a chunk missing. It’s been taken—ripped out—like someone had planned it.

 

My stomach lurches. The connection hits me like a lightning bolt..

 

It’s not beef. It’s not pork. It’s not some butchered cut from an animal.

 

My heart pounds, thudding so loud in my chest that it drowns out the sound of the sizzling meat. The pan. The flesh in the pan. The old man’s leg. The jagged wound. The chunk that’s missing. I don’t want to believe it, but the more I stare at the meat in the pan, the clearer it becomes.

 

It’s human meat.

 

The thought doesn’t come slowly. It doesn’t creep in with soft steps. It crashes down on me, a tidal wave of horror. My mind scrambles, trying to hold onto something stable, something real, but there’s nothing left to hold onto. The sizzling, the smell, the missing flesh—it’s all part of the same twisted, unimaginable truth.

I feel bile rising in my throat, thick and heavy. My stomach churns violently, but I can’t look away. I want to, I need to, but it’s like my body is frozen, my mind trapped in a nightmare that refuses to end. I can feel the blood draining from my face. The reality of what I’m seeing is too much. It’s too raw. Too real. Too horrifying. I can’t believe what’s happening.

My legs nearly give out from beneath me, and I stagger backward, my body shaking uncontrollably. I need to get away. I need to run.

 

But where would I go? What could I do?

 

I back away slowly, but then he’s there—John, suddenly in front of me. He lunges. I grab the hot pan from the stove and smack him across the face, he falls to the floor. I run toward the front door.  I slam into it, but it won’t open. John grabs my ankle, pulling me back. I kick. Hard. My foot connects with his face, a sickening crack reverberating in my ears.

I burst through the front door and sprint down the street, adrenaline surging. The sound of his footsteps behind me are relentless. I can’t stop. I can’t think. I just have to keep moving.

I reach an intersection, then a parking lot with some type of pop-up fair of some sort in the distance. I approach the partying people, desperation drives me through the crowd, begging for help, but no one moves. They just watch, eyes wide, mouths agape. The world goes quiet, and I’m alone in the middle of it all. Then I hear it. My name.

 

“Veraaaaa.”

 

It’s John. The crowd parts, and I see him standing there, a smile twisting his lips. The only exit is behind him.

I keep running, my mind screaming at me to get out of there. He grabs me by my hair, dragging me to the floor. A man from the crowd yells at John, but I beg him to stay away. Johns got a gun, I know he will shoot. But the man doesn’t listen. John lets him grab me with a smile on his awfully handsome face. Two police officers rush toward us. For a moment, I think I’m safe, but the next thing I hear is a gunshot. One officer drops to the ground. I duck, my heart racing. John moves closer, the gun aimed at the other officer, a steady, calculated look on his face. And then my safety shatters. Two more shots. The other officer and the man who tried to help me fall, lifeless.

 

The gunshot cracks through the air like thunder. I flinch. My hands go to my ears. But no one else moves. The crowd… just stands there. Eyes blank. Faces frozen. Like mannequins in a storefront window. One woman blinks slowly, lazily, like nothing just happened. A man sips his drink. Another chuckles at something unheard. No one screams. No one runs. The world around me feels like it’s stuck in the wrong reality.

 

What is this place?

 

He calmly walks up to me touching the base of my neck. John’s grip tightens, his voice cold and venomous. “If you keep making stupid decisions, you’ll keep getting people killed.” His eyes burn into mine then the smile creeps back, slow and sure. “You think you can run? You’ll be running forever, darlin’.”

As we walk towards the exit, a group of three women enter. John looks at them. A plan forms in my mind. I know it’s risky, but I have to try. I tell him I can get him one of those girls if he lets me go. He’s hesitant, but intrigued. He agrees. Somehow, I manage to convince one of the girls to walk around the fair with him. She’s hesitant, but she follows. John smiles at me as they walk away, that same twisted, knowing grin.

I tell the other women that I’ve had far too much to drink and I just want to go home. One of the women offers to take give me a ride. I rush with them to their car. We drive off, relief washing over me—until the driver suddenly stops the car. She gets out to grab water from the trunk, insisting it’ll make me feel better. Panic surges through me. I beg her not to, but she doesn’t listen. When she opens the trunk, she screams.

 I slowly get out of the car to see what she sees. The girl. The one that I insisted on going with John was dead. Red, seemingly painful hand marks around her throat. A note nailed to her chest:

 

“It’s your fault.”

 

I bolt away from the car and the screaming women. But as I run, a car comes speeding toward me. It’s John. He’s not stopping. ""Move those legs!"" he yells. ""Run!"" The car barrels toward me, the headlights blinding. I don’t have time to think. I leap—too late. The bumper hits me, sending me crashing to the ground. I scramble to my feet, ignoring the pain, pushing my body harder. I won’t give up. I spot an alley, a narrow passageway.

I nearly reach the alley, I hear the footsteps behind me, closer than ever. The unmistakable click of a gun. I freeze, but it’s too late. The shot rings out, pain exploding in my shoulder.  I don’t stop. I can’t. I dive towards the alley, my body screaming for rest, but there’s no time. Not now. Not with him so close. Another shot. It somehow misses me. Then the alley’s ahead. Just one more step.

 

Bang.

 

I’ve hit the ground, but I don’t know how. My mind is a blur, my hands slick with blood—my blood, his blood, I can't tell anymore. I push myself up, but the pain is unbearable. My body refuses to obey, every movement sluggish and heavy. I look down, and I see the blood staining the alley around me, dark and pooling. It’s all too much. My chest is heaving, my lungs fighting for air that doesn’t seem to come.

 

But then I hear it. A car. Tires screeching, coming closer.

 

I turn my head, vision doubling and spinning. A figure steps out of the car—John again. The same man, the same cold, dead eyes. He doesn’t even need to speak. I know what’s coming next. The same pattern. The same chase. And suddenly, I realize—there’s no end to this. Not for me. Not for him.

He’s not running toward me. No, he doesn’t have to. He knows I can’t run anymore. His eyes meet mine, and there’s no surprise, no anger. Just an awful, silent understanding between us. He’s been here before. He knows this dance too well. I see the glint in his eyes, the same calculation, the same coldness that’s haunted me from the very start. And that’s when it hits me. The realization, slow and steady, like a sinking weight in my stomach.

This is it. There is no escape. There never was.

 

I was doomed the moment he sat down next to me at the bar. I’ve been running in circles. All this time, running and running, but always coming back to the same place. The same moment. The same ending. No matter what I do, no matter how many times I think I’ve outsmarted him, it’s the same. I am stuck in this cycle with him—caught in a loop that has no end. A game I can’t win. I want to scream. To lash out. But I’m too tired. My body is betraying me. I can barely keep my eyes open now, the weight of my exhaustion and loss of blood pushing me down, dragging me under.

John takes a step closer, his boots crunching against the gravel. I can hear every movement, feel every inch of the distance between us. He knows I’m not going to fight anymore. He’s seen it in my eyes, felt it in my movements. I can’t keep running. I can’t keep pretending. The gun is in his hand. I see it, gleaming under the streetlight, and for a moment, I think maybe I’ll finally feel the relief of the end. Maybe this is it. The end of the road. The moment when it all stops.

 

But then—he doesn’t pull the trigger.

 

He’s toying with me.

 

John kneels down beside me, his cold fingers brushing my hair back from my face, his touch deceptively gentle. His smile is still there, almost kind in its twisted way, but I know better. I know what’s coming. ""You think you’re done? You’re not. I’ll keep you with me, even when you think it’s over. Because there’s no end to this. It’s just you and me."" His voice low, almost a whisper. But I hear it clearly. Like a promise. A curse. I close my eyes, the weight of those words pressing down on me. I’m trapped. The last thought that crosses my mind before everything goes black is this:

 

This is just the beginning.

Hey everyone!

I'm part of a small instrumental math rock band from Chile called **enlaces**, and we just released our **new single**: *avocado*.

The song blends playful melodies with some unexpected turns, and it was written thinking about those warm, everyday moments you share with the people you love — like cutting an avocado and chatting while the coffee brews (yes, seriously).

It even features a short voice sample from **Pedro Pascal** talking about how much he loves avocados 🥑

We’d be super grateful if you gave it a listen. Any feedback, thoughts or just sharing what it made you feel would mean the world to us 💚

1lq84v4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lq84v4,"Alléno Paris / 3*** / Paris, France","This was my favorite in Paris. Creative and delicious from start to finish. They have a discovery menu for €330 (8 course) and complete menu for €410 (10 course). I went with 8 courses. 

Food: One of my favourite meals of all time. The ""salad"" was too pretty to eat, the freshness of all the ingredients really shined and complemented one another. ""Gmochi"" of green rice was really creative, the texture was exactly like tapioca except there was a pea inside. Seabass w/ clams was cooked to perfection and aromatic. Millefeuille of wagyu and portobello was incredible. You could pick it apart slice by slice by fork. Amazing sear on surface and medium rare in the middle, how did they do it? 

Service: They schedule a call with you a couple days before to discuss any specific requirements and requests. Service at the restaurant was warm and attentive. Smiles from everyone, pretty great all around. 

Ambiance: Located at Pavillon Ledoyen, one of the oldest restaurants in Paris. The building holds 3 restaurants all operated by Yannick Alleno. The room is beautiful with a lot of natural light. Every table is well spaced out, I especially liked the dividers that separated each table. 

Summary: Food was exceptional, only minor complaint is I wish portions were smaller so that they could fit in more courses. Great all around and definition of a 3 star. ",11,1751492325.0,finedining,3,1.0,False

I am autistic and well aware of the discourse, so I was apprehensive not just because of the horror stories I've seen on here, but also because of my moral and ethical standards.  But today I hit 1 month at my company, and I really love it and how they treat both the students and employees. I work at a school for developmental disabilities, and my role best translates to a BT

I had a full week of paid training, then more training in the school building. I did a week of observations in different cl@ssrooms (censoring because cl@ssroom includes three whole letters in not allowed to say in this subreddit 

I got @ssigned to a cl@ssroom about two weeks ago and I'm still training on students. When tables are run, the staff training me and I switch out between who runs the table. I love the teamwork there, and how well the staff work together to solve emergency situations throughout the school. I don't feel forced to engage in anything I'm not comfortable in, including intense behavior situations I expect to be signed off on a couple students soon, and the cl@ss lead makes sure that the training and signing off goes from the ""easiest"" to ""hardest"" students. 

I was apprehensive about joining my specific cl@ssroom because some staff in there really baby talk our students (16-20 y/o), but after I brought it up to the cl@ss Lead, he did let me know they had meetings about it and he has requested help from higher ups. I also am not shy about talking about my autism and I think people appreciate the voice I give, and I often make suggestions about things they haven't thought of before and get told I have good ideas

Like our students, the company gives lots of reinforcement to employees. I get praised a lot by the other staff in my cl@ss about how I am doing, and the staff room always has free coffee/seltzer/soda cans. They really put in work to make employees feel welcomed and appreciated because turnover rate in the field is large in general. The insurance they give seems decent, and they give a good amount of days off and holidays. I have some issues with how they do it (everyone is forced to use their earned leave next week for holidays and can't opt to take it unpaid). But overall, I feel like they have a good system.

What I've seen on reddit really scared me about entering the field, but I think it also serves as a good way to acknowledge how privileged I am at my company, especially as a 21 year old right out of college (with a completely unrelated major) and no ABA experience. ",1,1751492153.0,ABA,1,1.0,False

Okay, let's talk about something that's been on my mind lately—timing. Not the kind that involves alarm clocks or calendar notifications, but the art of knowing *exactly* when to sip that perfect **Natural Mounjaro Drink**.

You know that feeling when you bite into homemade granola and it's got that perfect crunch? Well, timing your Natural Mounjaro is kind of like that—get it right, and you're in for a treat. Get it wrong, and... well, you're still drinking something healthy, but you might be missing out on the magic.

*Curious to try this at home?* 👉 [*Click here for the full guide*](https://www.amgroyal.com/when-do-you-drink-natural-mounjaro/)

# The Morning Ritual That Changed Everything

Here's the thing—I used to be one of those people who'd grab whatever was closest to caffeine and call it breakfast. But then I discovered the beauty of starting my day with a **Natural Mounjaro Drink**, and honestly? It's been a game-changer.

The best time? Right when you wake up, about 20-30 minutes before your first meal. Your body's been fasting all night (hence ""break-fast""), and it's primed to absorb all those good nutrients.

Think of it like preparing soil before planting seeds. You wouldn't just throw seeds on hard ground and hope for the best, right? Same principle here.

# Why Quality Ingredients Make All the Difference

Let me share something that took me way too long to figure out: not all ingredients are created equal. When you're making your **Natural Mounjaro Drink**, the quality of what goes in directly affects what you get out.

It's like the difference between store-bought granola (you know, the kind that's more sugar than oats) and the homemade stuff your neighbor makes that actually tastes like food. The secret? She uses high-quality oats, real vanilla, and honey that doesn't come from a plastic bear.

Same principle applies here. When you use premium, natural ingredients, your body notices. You feel the difference in your energy levels, your digestion, and honestly, even your mood.

# The Perfect Timing Breakdown

So when exactly should you be sipping this magical concoction? Let me break it down:

**Early Morning (6-8 AM):** • Best for kickstarting metabolism • Perfect on an empty stomach • Sets you up for steady energy all day

**Pre-Workout (30 minutes before exercise):** • Gives you that natural energy boost • Helps with endurance • Won't leave you feeling heavy

**Mid-Afternoon (2-4 PM):** • Great for beating that afternoon slump • Better than reaching for another coffee • Keeps you satisfied until dinner

# A Little History Lesson (Because Why Not?)

Fun fact: granola has been around since the 1860s, but it wasn't always the crunchy, sweet treat we know today. Dr. James Caleb Jackson (yes, that was his real name) created the first version called ""granula""—basically just dense bran nuggets that had to be soaked overnight just to be chewable.

The granola we love today? That's thanks to Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (yep, the cereal guy) who improved the recipe and called it ""granola."" He served it at his health sanitarium because he believed good nutrition was key to wellness.

Pretty cool how some things never change, right? People were focusing on natural, wholesome ingredients over 150 years ago, and here we are still talking about the same principles with our **Natural Mounjaro Drink**.

# The Secret to Perfect Texture (And Perfect Timing)

Here's where it gets interesting. Just like achieving that perfect granola crunch requires the right balance of ingredients, temperature, and timing, getting the most out of your Natural Mounjaro is all about the details.

The secret isn't just *what* you're drinking—it's *when* and *how* you're drinking it. Room temperature? Cold? Mixed with something else? All of these factors play a role in how your body processes and benefits from it.

I won't give away all the secrets here (because where's the fun in that?), but let's just say consistency is your best friend. When you make your **Natural Mounjaro Drink** part of your daily routine, that's when the real magic happens.

# Listen to Your Body

Here's something nobody talks about enough: your body is pretty smart. It'll tell you when it needs what it needs—you just have to pay attention.

Some days, you might crave your Natural Mounjaro first thing in the morning. Other days, it might be calling your name around 3 PM when you hit that wall. Both are totally fine!

The key is being consistent with the quality while staying flexible with the timing.

# Making It Work for Your Lifestyle

Let's be real—we're all juggling a million things. Between work, family, and trying to remember if we fed the dog (twice), adding another thing to our routine can feel overwhelming.

But here's the beauty of the **Natural Mounjaro Drink**: it's flexible. Busy morning? Take it with you. Long day ahead? Pack it in your bag. Unexpected afternoon meeting? It's right there waiting for you.

The best routine is the one you'll actually stick to. Whether that's first thing in the morning, right before your workout, or as your afternoon pick-me-up—what matters is that you're consistent with it.

# The Bottom Line

So, when do you drink Natural Mounjaro? The honest answer is: whenever it works best for you and your body. But if you want my personal recommendation? Start with the morning routine and see how you feel.

Your body (and your energy levels) will thank you for it. And who knows? You might just find yourself looking forward to that perfect moment when everything clicks—just like biting into that perfectly crunchy, perfectly sweet piece of homemade granola.

I’m exploring the idea of creating a new kind of dating app and am hoping to pilot it right here in Cork. I don’t have a fully fleshed-out concept yet - just a few early ideas I’d like to test and validate - but I think there's a gap in the dating space, especially when it comes to local, genuine connections.

A bit about me: I have a background in IT and some startup experience. This would be a bootstrapped project (meaning no money involved at this stage), so it’s very much an experiment and passion project to begin with. If it gains traction, we can take it further.

I’m looking for someone based in Cork who’s interested in relationships, dating culture, or just wants to be involved in building something from the ground up. You don’t need to have any tech experience - just bring ideas, enthusiasm, and a bit of time to brainstorm and collaborate.

If this sounds interesting to you, drop me a DM or comment below and we can grab a coffee or chat further.

I know egg freezing experience can be different for different people and it can be very tough for some. For me, it’s definitely not easy, but I found it surprisingly **tolerable**—not as difficult as I'd mentally prepared myself for. I'm incredibly grateful and happy with my results (24 retrieved, 21 frozen). I'm aware that I might be considered a ""better responder,"" which likely made parts of my journey smoother than others. However, I truly want to encourage anyone who has been thinking about it to **get tested, get informed, and try not to freak out** before you even start. You might find it more manageable than you expect, especially if you're generally in good health.

**BASELINES**: 34 yr | AMH 4.69 | Follicles 23

**PROTOCOL**

Stim Day 1 (period day 3)

baseline E2 64 pg/mL. Started 225 IU Gonal-F + 75 IU Menopur between 7-9 pm

Stim Day 2 - 5

Continue 225 IU Gonal-F + 75 IU Menopur between 7-9 pm

Stim Day 6

First monitoring appointment, found 12 follicles between 10-15 mm, E2 1778 pg/mL

Start cetrotide 0.25mg right after the appointment (1 day earlier than planned) and reduce Gonal-F from 225 IU to 200 IU.

Stim Day 7-8

0.25 mg cetrotide between 7-9 am

200 IU Gonal-F + 75 IU Menopur between 7-9 pm

Stim Day 9

0.25 mg cetrotide between 7-9 am

Second monitoring appointment, found 16 follicles between 15-22 mm, E2 4588 pg/mL

Instructed to stop all stims, trigger shot 11:30 pm with 4mg lupron

**RETRIEVAL & RECOVERY**

My egg retrieval was on Day 11 at 11:30 am. It’s a smooth experience. I was able to walk right after the retrieval (while the pain medications are still in effect), and even feel less bloated. In the afternoon, I had occasional twinges in my ovaries, but these were relieved by reducing movement and sitting with a hot water bottle. The twinges were mostly gone in the late evening. 

The next day I can move around the house doing light chores. Then day 3 I was able to stride down the street hopping between different coffee shops.

**RESULTS**  
24 retrieved, 21 frozen

**SIDE EFFECTS**

* Bloating: Yes, definitely bloated. For me, it felt like an extended and intensified version of my typical period bloating. I'd read on this subreddit that constipation is common, so I focused on staying hydrated, upping my fiber intake, and doing mild, frequent walking. This helped me maintain close to normal bowel movements, which in turn managed the bloating. For the first 5 stim days, the bloating was manageable as long as I embraced looking a bit ""pregnant"" and wore my loosest clothes. I even worked from the office as usual. By Stim Day 6, my normal walking pace started feeling uncomfortable, and I sometimes needed to lean forward or lie on my stomach for comfort (possibly due to my retroverted uterus). Starting Day 7, I worked from home and moved very slowly. Interestingly, my body seemed to adjust, and the discomfort became much more manageable even as my follicles continued to grow.
* Weight change: negligible. The bloating actually reduced my appetite, and my body naturally gravitated away from greasy foods, feeling full with smaller portions. My peak weight was only about 1 kg over my normal. By day 3 post-retrieval, even with lingering bloat, my weight was back to normal.
* Mood swing:  I didn't experience any obvious mood swings. The biggest mental hurdle was the daily injections—it was hard to fully focus on work while constantly thinking about the upcoming shots and potential outcomes.

**Other things I did (may or may not have helped)**

* 7 months prior to the cycle (4 months before consultation): Got off birth control pills and started daily supplements: a multivitamin, fish oil, and CoQ-10.
* 2 months prior to the cycle: Reduced caffeine to no more than one espresso shot per day, and cut it out completely during the cycle.
* I've consistently exercised at least 4 days a week for at least two years (cardio and weight training). I don't follow a strict diet but generally eat low-carb and high-protein. Overall, I feel quite healthy, and my general lab work is always within range.
* I've never been a smoker and rarely drink alcohol.",1,1751491724.0,eggfreezing,0,1.0,False

TLDR; Mary filed for a restraining order against her ex, Paul, after he punched her current partner Jack while volunteering at the community theater Paul worked for. The restraining order was denied as the PT judge believed Paul isn't a threat to Mary, even though this has been escalating since December. Is there anything Mary or Jack can do to keep Paul away from them?

Context: 
Mary (32f) and Paul (38m) met through a community theater they both volunteered for and dated for 4 months last year before ultimately breaking up in December after Mary realized Paul was an alcoholic with mental/anger issues. Paul threatened to kill himself for Mary leaving him, so Mary asked Paul's sister take away his knife collection and keep him from self harming. 

Mary went on a family vacation and ended up having to block Paul because he would not stop reaching out to her, so Paul decided to start messaging Mary's parents and close friends through Facebook to try to get a hold of her.

Paul was running lights for the current show at the theater and ended up having a meltdown after scrolling through his phone in the booth during a performance, sobbing while punching the wall and desk before storming out.

About 3 days later, the day Mary gets back in town, Paul went to Mary's house and left a Machete on her porch sometime during the night, with a note about how he was going to fix himself for her and they were meant to be together.

In January:
Mary started dating Jack. Mary and Jack were both in a play together at the theater and Paul was since hired on by the theater to be the shop forman. After realizing Mary was in the upcoming play, he began hanging around the theater every single day from 10am until closing, sometimes even sleeping there, just to be around and possibly keep an eye on Mary during the rehearsals. Mary was asked by the theater ED and the show director to keep her relationship hidden from Paul, so that it wouldn't cause any issues; (the theater knew Paul had anger issues as he had been put on a temporary suspension about a decade prior for throwing a coffee table at his sister when she woke him up to go on stage because he was about to miss his cue). Mary and Jack agreed to keep their relationship hidden at the theater.

In April:
Mary's friend, Rita, was running lights for the show and was working with Paul to learn how to operate them (as Paul is the only person at the theater that currently knows how to operate the light board). Paul began asking Rita about Mary and Rita told Paul she didn't feel comfortable talking about that.

Later, Paul texted Rita and asked her to read a letter he had wrote for Mary that ""explained his side of the story"" and ""why he is who he is"" to try to get her to ""see things from his shoes"". Rita told him she didn't want to read the letter because everyone is trying to move on from that situation and that he should try to move on from the situation as well. Paul became enraged and argued how she was ignorant and wrong for not being willing to read about his past to better understand him. Rita told him that she was not interested in knowing someone's past to be able to see how they hold themselves and react in the present and told him that he needed to stop talking about Mary and the letter. Paul continued, so Rita blocked Paul and went no contact. 

Two days later, Rita went to set up the lights for the performance but noticed the settings had been changed, Rita let the director know and the director got Paul to come fix it, Rita immediately left and went downstairs, so she wouldn't be alone in the booth with Paul. Paul quickly switched the settings back before following Rita down but Rita went in the bathroom, so he went back up. Rita decided to stay downstairs with the cast to avoid any confrontation with Paul, about 15 minutes later Paul came downstairs again but stopped at the bottom of the stairs, in the doorway, to look into a mirror on the wall and check if Rita was alone before entering. When he saw Rita talking with Mary and a few other cast mates he went back upstairs.

*The theater has cameras set up that watch the stage, shop, and downstairs with display monitors in the light booth and downstairs.*
When the cast went to get changed and Rita was alone for the first time, Paul came downstairs and told Rita he needed to talk to her, Rita let him know she didn't feel comfortable talking right now and asked to just focus on the show. Paul stood there still and silent for about 20 seconds before smacking his lips and saying ""Okay!"" while hurrying up the stairs. About 5 minutes later, Paul came back down and told Rita he really needed to talk to her and apologize that he came off the wrong way. Rita thanked him for apologizing but then told him again that she did not want to talk about it and just focus on the show. Paul immediately punched a wall, so Rita ran upstairs and locked herself in the booth calling the director, while Paul was slamming multiple doors as he ran out of the theater and sped away in his car.

Rita told the show director what happened and later, the ED told her he was no longer to be around the theater while this show was happening and they took away his building key.

Jack got cast in the upcoming show and Rita is the AD. The director told Rita that Paul would be doing the light design for the show but assured her that Paul would never be left alone with her.

June 29th:
Mary was volunteering to work the theater's outdoor booth at an event. Paul was there for a theater performance and was helping set up and tear down. 

After the event ended, Jack was helping Mary and the other volunteers tear down the booth, when Paul grabbed Jack's arm to turn him around and punched Jack in the leftside of his jaw. Jack stumbled back and Paul lurched towards him again before Mary jumped in the middle of them with her arms up and asked him to stop and calm down. Paul told Mary he wanted to talk and she ushered him away from Jack. 

Paul told Mary that he knew they were meant to be together and that she still cared for him. Mary apologized that it was not true and that she loves Jack and is not interested in getting back together. Paul went back and forth with Mary on it a few times before Mary said that she was going to walk away and that he had to promise he would not follow her, Paul said he would only agree if Mary agreed to talk with him about this again another time. Mary agreed and got away. 

Mary and Jack went to file a report at the police station. The deputy told them that it wasn't physical assault since there was no bodily injury, that it would just be considered harassment and that a restraining order wouldn't be possible for Jack, but maybe for Mary since she used to date Paul and that she'd have to file with the courthouse during the week.

Today:
Mary had her hearing for the restraining order but was denied as the judge didn't think Paul was a threat to her.

Is there anything else Mary can do to keep Paul away from her and Jack? Or a way to reapply for the restraining order? Any and all help would be very appreciated! Thank you!",1,1751491495.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False
1lq7t47,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lq7t47,"Looking for ideas on general layout, couch and rug placements","Our living room in our 1940s cape cod home has a bit of a funky layout. I've attached the floorplan, but basically we have a long but narrowish living room that has about an 8 foot opening into the dining room. Note, the main entrance is the foyer not the entryway near the bedroom. I'm looking for suggestions on our general layout along with couch and rug placement. 

I've been really indecisive with how to decorate this space hence the incomplete look, and have not been feeling inspired. Here are the photo perspectives I've provided along with my current ideas: 

1: Floorplan for context
2 and 3: Perspective from foyer entryway
4 and 5 Perspective from arch into dining room
6: Fireplace area
7: view into dining room 


-Add a rug under the couch and a narrow ottoman/coffee table. Couch dims are 7.5 ' × 4.5' with chaise. and I'm thinking about a 6' x 9' or larger rug. The couch is about 5ft from the TV so I don't wanna go any closer. 

-Add some wall shelves near the TV for game consoles and displayable items.  

-Create a conversation/small seating area in front of the non-functional fireplace and plants. Add a small rug here. I'm thinking two small cozy chairs and maybe a little table. 

-The wall to the left of the plants and above the light wooden storage unit is eventually going be a gallery wall filled with prints and photos but I haven't gotten around to laying it out. 

There are only few constraints I really have, the main being that I don't want the TV over the fireplace if it can be helped. I was considering this and flipping the couch around, but haven't tried it out yet since I don't love the idea of the TV up so high and I'd have to revaluate console/DVD/game storage from the TV stand. I also don't want to take too many plants away from here since this area gets the best sunlight, which further limits the available space. 

My general style is an eclectic and witchy mid-century modern. I love natural textures, rich earthy colors, greenery and trinkets. I definitely think adding some rugs will really help divide up the space and look forward to hearing what y'all have to say! ",1,1751491481.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

We have a great relationship — the healthiest that either of us have ever had. We’re great at communicating, have similar interests and values, both have a good sense of humor, get along well with each other’s families and friends, etc. We’re even moving in together in September. 

Because we’ll be moving in together in a few months, I want to enjoy my “alone time” now while I still can. She’s known from the start of our relationship I value my independence because I’ve been in some controlling relationships in this past. 

We see each other once a week for anywhere between 2-4 days, depending on our work schedules. We also go away together about once a month or every other month (little weekend getaways). So, we spend what I consider a good amount of time together. 

Last week we went away and spent 6 days together. When she was supposed to leave on Monday morning she asked if she could stay an extra day because she was working from home and I had the day off. I told her I was looking forward to spending my day off to myself, as we just spent 6 days together, and I needed to recharge. She said that was fine but then guilted me into staying. I don’t think she meant to make me feel bad, she just hates having to leave and will make me feel bad and let her stay longer or have me stay longer if I’m staying over her place. 

I’ve noticed lately when she’s staying at my place, she’s been leaving more and more of her things, expecting me to make her coffees / breakfasts and lunches when she’s WFH (if I have the day off, because “I’m so good at it” and “not doing anything else”). I’ve been doing her laundry as well. I don’t mind doing these things for her but don’t like when it feels expected. Especially when she’ll make comments about how she buys more (this is something I’ve been uncomfortable with in our relationship but working to get over). She comes from money and has a higher paying job. I have a decent job but she has significantly more money than me and will call herself my “sugar mama” joking sometimes. I tell her I don’t expect her to buy everything, and will often try to myself, but she turns me down and tells me I can pay her back in other ways (where household chores or other things come into the mix). This is something we frequently communicate about though, and she says I don’t have to do what I don’t want to. She was just trying to make me feel better and make things “fair.” Anyway, this is not the main issue at hand. 

My biggest issue is her guilting me into always spending more time together, to the point I’ve had to cancel on friends and family when she’d rather it just be the two of us, or has wanted me to stay longer / her to stay longer at my place. Two day visits will often turn into nearly a week. And then when I finally do get a day or two to myself she’s constantly texting, calling, or FaceTiming me. When I bring it up to her, she tells me she understands, but then I’ll always feel like I’m the bad guy for wanting a little “me time.” AITAH for not wanting to spend every waking second with her despite loving her very much?

Lars is exposed as the landlord in the video but continually denies it in the call. Only when I send him his own whatsapp photo and a still of him from the video does he stop pretending.

  
Once exposed, Sam B. actually expresses his admiration for my work and instantly says he is happy because he can now 'sue' me because I showed him a photo of the video (???). 

I call Bullshit and then promise to send more letters to his properties. 

Then he invites me for a drink ""If you are a real man"". 

He calls me a hippy and brags about being a muslim who is ""gonna take over the world"".

Again threatens to sue me because the photo is ""confidential""

""Founder of RentBuster... founder of my ass buster"" was his followup to my question about what he threatens to sue me for. 

Again invites me out for a drink ""If you are a real man"" and offered to buy me ""Irish coffee"".

Asked if he liked threatening women and calling them ""Kanker whore""

Anyway I have an iPhone, so does my sister. Last month I got a notification that an AirTag was found on me under unknown items. I was a bit spooky because it showed a map of my area and the red dotted line plus dots to show were the tag went? Btw I don’t use a purse when I’m out, I only have myself my clothing and my keys plus phone/ when I was in school or work I did but guys I work from home.

At first it made sense, halfway to the coffee shop… the area I stopped to text a friend… and the grocery store. But it didn’t show all my locations. I was with my sister for part of it but not all. We thought maybe it’s one of our AirPods, but we didn’t take them. No one in my house owns an AirTag and no new electronics have entered our house.

Our neighbors have a dog. I assumed maybe they put an air tag on their dog or their belongings, but at 2am it shows the AirTag moving. I got close enough to play the sound but didn’t hear anything. People say it’s unreliable to listen for a sound. Again it only plays the sound if I step out. But the map showed erratic behavior like the tag was on an animal?

I’d ask them but their dog sometimes cries or howls so we asked them politely about that and the response was ok it won’t happen and it keeps happening because they leave the dog home alone.

“Jaime! Mijo!” Bianca called out as she flung open the door to her home. She pulled off the coat she had over her nurse’s scrubs and hung it on a peg by the kitchen counter. She and Alberto had just come back from an emergency parent teacher conference at Jaime’s school. She did have to call in a favour for someone to take her shift, and even then she had to get there from the hospital itself. Milagro bounced over from where she was watching TV and gave her mom a quick hug and wordlessly pointed to Jaime’s room. Bianca smiled and tousled her hair. Alberto leaned over and kissed his daughter on the forehead before sharing an exhausted glance with his wife. At least their youngest child’s school didn’t have any problems.

&nbsp;

After a moment, he piped up. “You wanna go talk to him? I’ll make us some drinks.”

&nbsp;

Bianca nodded and mouthed ‘four sugars’. Their mutual code word for a coffee after a very, very long day. Alberto leaned down and gently grabbed his daughter’s hand.

&nbsp;

“Milagro, you want to make some hot chocolate?” he asked her, and she nodded excitedly. The two got to work by the fridge as Bianca stalked down the darkened corridor leading to the bedrooms.

&nbsp;

“Jaime?” she called out again. She didn’t dare ask if he was home or not, because of course he would be. For all intents and purposes he was ‘safety’ grounded after a terrorist attack at his school. She bit her lip at feeling guilty about that. Not that he seemed interested in going anywhere except to visit Brenda at the hospital. He and Paco had been going pretty much every day. They always did stuff as a trio so it probably felt hollow with just the two of them.

&nbsp;

She rapped her knuckles on his door and then opened it, not waiting for an answer. There he was, curled up on his bed with his earphones in watching something on his phone. Silent as a mouse and wreathed in a blanket. Whatever he was watching the volume was turned very high up, she could hear the crackling static from here. The room was depressingly dark, the lights were off and he’d closed the blinds to keep out the light of the midnight moon. She flicked the switch on in the way only a mildly perturbed mother could do when she found her son behaving like a gremlin in a cave.

&nbsp;

He blinked and shielded his eyes, only now noticing his mother in the doorframe. “Oh, mom, you’re back.” He said way too loudly then pulled out one of the earphones. “Sorry, didn’t hear you come in.”

&nbsp;

“I can see why. Whatever you’re watching is at full blast, that’ll damage your ears, mijo.”

&nbsp;

[Jaime Reyes, your maternal unit’s concern is unfounded. I can regenerate any damage done to our eardrums again.]

&nbsp;

Jaime ignored the alien in his head. Though, for that matter, he also ignored his mother in the only way a mildly depressed teenage boy could. He shrugged and quietly said “I guess.”

&nbsp;

She wrinkled her nose as she walked in the room. “Mijo it stinks in here, have you been shut in here the whole day?” She threw open the windows and let the cold nighttime air in. “Did you eat anything?”

&nbsp;

[Jaime Reyes, your maternal unit appears to be expressing the same nutritional concerns I was. You are exhibiting an excess of cortisol levels.]

&nbsp;

“Just some water, not hungry.” He mumbled and pulled the cover over himself. Bianca furrowed her brow and pulled the cover down to place a hand against his forehead. Sweaty, but no fever. He pushed her hand away. “I’m fine mom. Just…” he looked away, “bored, I guess.”

&nbsp;

“Well.” She bit her lip, not knowing if this news would make him more or less sad. “Your school will be opening up again Monday.”

&nbsp;

It was his turn to furrow his brow, but more in confusion than concern. He slowly sat up. “What?”

&nbsp;

[Jaime Reyes, this is a correct statement. El Paso High School will have its reopening in two days.]

&nbsp;

*You knew, Blue? Why didn’t you tell me?*

&nbsp;

[There was a sixty-four point five chance this information would have led to an increase in stress levels. Jaime Reyes, I cannot afford to allow further fluctuations in our mental state. It would negatively impact the regeneration process.]

&nbsp;

Jaime was still mad at Blue. Even though they’d been sitting here mostly recovering from the absolute thrashing that they had at the former Red Beetle’s hands and it was kind of fair Blue wanted to. He still didn’t like that information was kept from him.

&nbsp;

[You do not listen to my protests against visiting your school friend Brenda every day, thereby exacerbating existing wounds.]

&nbsp;

*Still? You didn’t think this was important stuff to know? How the heck did they rebuild a whole school in two weeks?!*

&nbsp;

[Jaime Reyes, you did receive an email from your school.]

&nbsp;

Jaime was silent.

&nbsp;

[I believe it was lost underneath the seventeen different emails you receive from your mobile games reminding you to collect daily rewards.]

&nbsp;

*Well you won’t let me play any other games.*

&nbsp;

Bianca had noticed the long silence as Jaime stared intently into nothingness. She decided she had to say something. “What are you watching, Mijo?” she blurted out, pointing at his phone, which was still abuzz with light and colour and some loud obnoxious voice.

&nbsp;

“Oh just someone playing a video game.”

&nbsp;

She raised her eyebrow. “You’re watching someone play a video game? Why not just play it yourself?”

&nbsp;

“Oh my laptop can’t run this game. It’s not really powerful enough.” This was in part a lie. It was true that Jaime’s laptop couldn’t run any of the games he wanted to play. However, Blue had significantly greater processing power. Jaime could, and had, run the games on himself. It was weird, and not quite VR, and to anyone observing it looked like he was more or less catatonic apart from the random tapping of his fingers on his mattress. Though Blue had forbidden it while he was attempting to regenerate their body. All processing power was to be directed to recover core functionalities that were overexerted and spent during their fight against Red. “Plus they’re really expensive so I’d have to buy them,” he added. This was also a lie. Blue had downloaded the entire internet and analysed much of what comprised it. There was not a single game they had played yet that Blue had not been able to pirate. All of this to say, he was relegated to mobile games.

&nbsp;

Bianca felt a bit guilty that her son was still using a crappy hand-me-down laptop when he started middle school. Alberto’s brother did tech work for some company and had given his nephew this laptop when his company got him a new one. He was about to start middle school, he’ll need a computer. This was many years ago and with how fast technology moved, Bianca wasn’t surprised that it had already been outmoded. It was already five years old when he got it.

&nbsp;

“Well, we can talk about school tomorrow. You should get some sleep, mijo.” She stroked his hair. The intrusive voice of Bianca’s own upbringing howled ‘he’s been resting all day what do you mean’, but no, her little boy had been through a lot recently. He can rest. “You don’t have to go, yet. You can take time. It was so sudden.” She choked a little, thinking about the accident again. She pulled him into a hug. “You can take all the time you need.”

&nbsp;

Then she pushed him back and straightened his shoulders and cleared her throat. “But you need to eat dinner before you go to bed, okay?” she glared at him. It was worded as a question, but Jaime knew a demand when he saw one and nodded. “Good, I’ll go ask your father to heat it up.”

&nbsp;

With that, Bianca disappeared back down the hallway. She wondered if maybe she was too soft on him sometimes. Her own mother was a harsh taskmaster, and Bianca had to learn a lot at a young age. And she dreaded being like that, but she did worry that she was pushing the pendulum too far in the other direction. When she gossiped with the other nurses during their shifts, they were always understanding, but she knew behind their glances that some of them thought she was being too much of a pushover. At least that’s what she thought. She shook her head, enough of those thoughts. She had a whole weekend to spend with her family. It had been months since she had two days off on the weekend. And right now, her loving husband was making her the strongest and sweetest coffee their money could buy.

&nbsp;

Jaime waited until his mother was out of earshot.

&nbsp;

[Jaime Reyes, I am eighty-five percent sure your maternal unit cannot read minds.]

&nbsp;

*Yeah I know but, you know, she’s got that mom sense.*

&nbsp;

[This is accurate and frightening. My calculations have not been able to make sense of this phenomenon.]

&nbsp;

*Anyway, tell me everything you know about the school.*

&nbsp;

Jaime braced himself for the information download. It always felt strange, but he supposed being drowned in a sea of knowledge would feel like that. But this time it didn’t come. Blue simply made a loud ping noise in his head.

&nbsp;

“Ow, what the fuck.” he cursed under his breath.

&nbsp;

[I was attempting to do the clearing of the throat that your kind are so fond of doing. This is the closest I can approach without attempting to wrestle control of your neck muscles.]

&nbsp;

*Right.*

&nbsp;

[Information download would be detrimental to the recovery process. Instead, Jame Reyes, I will provide the relevant information directly to you.]

&nbsp;

*You’re going to just tell me?*

&nbsp;

[Exactly, Jaime Reyes.]

&nbsp;

Blue paused as Jaime smiled at the novelty of a shared consciousness having to speak to him directly instead of beam knowledge into his mind.

&nbsp;

[Per regeneration protocol I have diverted much processing power away from regular information downloads. Reducing frequency of updates to our knowledge repository on humanity’s international information network two once every forty-eight hours.]

&nbsp;

*Is that why I keep waking up with a headache every few days?*

&nbsp;

[Correct. Every forty-eight hours, updates are conducted at 0300 hours in what you refer to as Mountain Standard Time designation within the Earth’s solar cycle.]

&nbsp;

*Okay, yeah, whatever, enough with the preamble, Blue, out with it.*

&nbsp;

[Regardless, Jaime Reyes, know that this information is not the most up to date.]

&nbsp;

Jaime swore he felt a zap of static in his head, perhaps Blue’s equivalent of a grumble.

&nbsp;

[The El Paso High School was purchased by a private corporation called Amp Holdings. There were no significant transactions made by this company within the past six months, and prior to that this organisation did not exist. This highly suggests it was what is described on the internet as a shell corporation to obfuscate the involvement of another business’ interest with the school.]

&nbsp;

*Well that’s suspicious. What would they want with a school.*

&nbsp;

[Jaime Reyes, their motivations can only be conjectured at this juncture. Further information would be required to confirm any of the numerous theories regarding their connections to several underworld interests.]

&nbsp;

*Wait, underworld? Like, the mob?*

&nbsp;

[Usage of shell corporations has in the majority of situations lead to a connection with organised criminals, correct. Whatever the ties this corporation had, they seemingly had access to an incredibly large number of funds in order to purchase the school grounds and then immediately rebuild it.]

&nbsp;

*So they suspiciously bought it right after it was reduced to rubble? That’s…really sus, Blue. The mere mention of the underworld had Jaime’s pop culture infected brain thinking of any and every business trick of ill-repute. You don’t think they did it? Like they attacked and destroyed the school to get it for cheap? Would everyone be safe? What the heck, why isn't the police doing anything about this?*

&nbsp;

[Possible but not probable, Jaime Reyes. The amount of United States Dollars spent in reconstructing the school and restaffing it would far exceed the amount spent if they had simply purchased it outright prior to the attack. These information sources are not completely verifiable, suggesting that it could not be used by police investigators, assuming that the municipal forces were aware or interested in the involvement of less than scrupulous parties.]

&nbsp;

*But like the government wouldn’t just sell it, right? Like someone has to know? Like...someone has to do something, right?*

&nbsp;

Blue was silent.

&nbsp;

Jaime's shoulders sagged with a painful realisation about the world. Blue had beamed enough information about corruption in El Paso into his head before. *Yeah, nevermind, they would.*

&nbsp;

[Independent reports on the rate of reconstruction of the school corroborate that it was, and I quote, “unnaturally fast”. Hypotheses suggest some kind of superpowered technology or perhaps individuals or implements of magical nature were utilised.]

&nbsp;

*So whoever these people are, they have some crazy tech. Or, uh, magic, I guess.*

&nbsp;

[This seems to be the most likely recourse, Jaime Reyes. The question that remains, of course, is why would they desire to rebuild your school. I have found no information on their motives. Reach fabrication technology could easily reconstruct buildings within short periods of time.]

&nbsp;

Jaime sort of felt it coming.

&nbsp;

[Suggested course of action is to flee the state, Jaime Reyes.]

&nbsp;

*Yep, there it is. No, I’m not fleeing the state. My family’s here.*

&nbsp;

[Your family would likely be a liability if attempting to escape.]

&nbsp;

*No means no, dumbass. We’ll just not go to school.*

&nbsp;

[This course of action is inadvisable, Jaime Reyes. Your maternal and paternal units would grow concerned at your lack of interest in education.]

&nbsp;

“Jaime, your pasta's ready.” Alberto’s deep baritone voice rumbled up from the kitchen. “Come watch a movie with us, mi hijo!”

&nbsp;

Jaime snapped awake from his conspiratorial conversation with Blue. It had been a while since he spent some time with his family. He did consider what Blue suggested for a moment, of running away, sprinting into the night and never seeing them again. And his heart sank. He couldn’t. It made him angry that Blue even suggested that. He loved his family. And dammit, he was going to spend time with them.

&nbsp;

*Did you plan to annoy me enough to want to spend time with my family?* He growled in his head, leaping out of his bed and grabbing a pair of slippers.

&nbsp;

[Negative.]

&nbsp;

Jaime scowled at the alien in his head, then hollered back to his father. “Coming! Don’t let Milagro choose the movie!”

Out of 7 - SIX (6) are PGTA normal!! I don’t know how this is possible as I’ve had 2 chemicals in less than a year. Just unexplained infertility for over a year and half. All I’ve been doing is giving praise and thanks to God. I know this still doesn’t guarantee a baby but it gives me so much hope. 

Don’t give up. 

Anyone wondering - I’m using Pozitivf Fertility in San Antonio, TX and they recently opened a new clinical in Houston Tx. 

My AMH in April of this year was 2.01 - BMI Normal for height/weight. 

All bloodwork and testing normal except I was vitamin d deficient. Starting taking Nordics 5,000 iu immediately. And I was consistent mostly during the week with prenatal vitamin - I used Root’d prenatal hydration packets because I dont like taking large pills. I also walked alot!! I sit at work so as soon as I got home my husband and I would walk 10,000 steps a day. Also just to throw this out there - I drank a cup of coffee everyday because it brings me joy.

1lq7ax1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lq7ax1/aita_for_breaking_up_with_my_ex_by_getting/,AITA for breaking up with my ex by getting married to the love of my life.,"I am 29(F) and I met my ex at work, we’ll call him Brad. He was my boss’s brother and he was helping me with my project- I was hired to be the project manager for a new vertical of their business.

We spent 2 months literally joined at the hip doing everything together, talking and catching up on coffees between vendor runs. I started falling for him and he for me. Cut to the launch of the project 7 weeks later, he and I are constantly talking and the evening before the launch he tells me that he’s married with a kid and he loves me as he has never met anyone like me.

I reluctantly go with him for a coffee to hear him out where he tells me how he was pressured into marrying her and they had a kid as he was sick on a deathbed and how he never loved her and they barely shared a loved bond.

We started secretly meeting and going on dates as no one at work or around us could know about our affair. We did this for 3 months, and every time we would go out, he would make me buy him gifts and pay for our dates saying he didn’t have money or had a family to support. In the beginning it was not an issue but then it got too much as I don’t come from money and I also needed to save.

Our 3rd month in, just before our big date on Valentine’s Day, his wife found the phone he used to talk to me with and threatened to leave him. She doesn’t know it was me as he didn’t save my name on that phone. Throughout this ordeal he didn’t tell me anything, just to not message him for a while.

A couple weeks later we started to go on dates again and he kept blaming me for all the pain that he had to go through but in a veiled subtle way. How he was defying his family to be with me and anytime I would try to break it off with him he would emotionally blackmail me saying I was the happiest thing that ever happened to him and how he couldn’t thing of living without me.

I started to do then distance myself. Going out like how I used to, getting drunk and partying as usual. He didn’t like that, as he didn’t drink and in hindsight was exceptionally boring. So we did this back and forth for a couple months where I constantly kept trying to breakup but he just knew what to say.

We are now at 9 months since we started seeing each other and I was done. So I told him I can’t see him and that I was leaving town for a couple days to think it through. So my friend & I took a trip where she introduced me to this man who was amazing. The first time I saw him, he was everything. He was , loving, kind and so so fun. We couldn’t stop talking to each other even if we tried.

When we got back from the trip, I knew I would get married to this man. So I went to work and told my coworker( the ex) that I was set to get married and it was over for real. He kept calling me to go out with him one last time for old times sake and I kept saying no. 2 weeks later the new bf came to my city and proposed to me and we decided to get married in 2 months over that weekend. So I went back to work and handed in my 4 week notice as I would be moving cities, and told brad the same. There was a lot of name calling involved from his end and he made me feel horrible that I cried. Even though he was the one who followed me everywhere and convinced me to date him, he made it seem as if I was the only one in the wrong here.

1lq7876,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lq7876/could_the_jura_e6_platinum_be_the_best/,Could the Jura E6 Platinum be the best super-automatic espresso machine? Review,"Using the Jura 15465 E6 Platinum espresso machine has genuinely changed my coffee routine in ways I didn’t expect. Every morning, my kitchen now smells like a specialty café, and there’s that satisfying hum of the machine gearing up to brew a perfect cup. I’ve sampled everything it offers, from a robust espresso to a luxuriously frothy cappuccino. While I’m thrilled with its performance, it’s not without its quirks—some delightful, others mildly exasperating. 

**Build Quality and Design**  
The aesthetic of this espresso machine is undeniably sleek. Its platinum finish gives it a modern yet timeless appeal, and the compact footprint ensures it doesn’t dominate countertop space. I found the build sturdy; it feels premium the moment you interact with it. At 22 pounds, moving it around isn’t practical, so you’ll want to find a permanent spot for it in your kitchen. One touch commands operate its functions beautifully, enabled by the button interface that I surprisingly preferred over the overly flashy touchscreen designs seen in competitor models. 

**Key Benefits**  
- The fully automatic operation ensures consistency without requiring barista-level skills.  
- The Professional Aroma Grinder captures more of the coffee bean’s essence.  
- Programmable settings allow tailored brew strength, temperature, and milk foam preferences.  
- Integrated maintenance programs streamline cleaning and upkeep.  

**Performance and Brewing Technology**  
Testing its brewing capabilities proved to be a delightful experience. The standout Pulse Extraction Process (PEP) delivers an extraction akin to barista-level quality. You can taste the clarity in each shot—it’s rich and aromatic every single time. One feature I couldn’t live without is the eighth-generation 3D brewing technology, which ensures water is evenly distributed through the coffee, producing a strong and flavorful cup. The brewing consistency remains unmatched, whether experimenting with a mild roast or a dark espresso blend.  

[Check Jura 15465 E6 Platinum price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0bvmzrnzl/)

**Usability and User Experience**  
Initially, setting up the machine felt intimidating. Once I followed the instructions, it became effortless to navigate. A lot of its charm lies in how intuitive the operations are for such a sophisticated device. Transitioning between espresso and milk drinks is seamless. However, as much as I love programmable features, cycling through all the menu settings when making adjustments for family members did take some getting used to. My teenagers finally mastered it but not without a few failed attempts. 

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Milk frother lacks rich foam consistency for cappuccino enthusiasts.  
- Uses a considerable amount of water, necessitating frequent refills.  
- Loud grinder motor during operation might wake up the household.  

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
While I appreciate its integrated maintenance programs, cleaning the milk system can be tedious. It’s not something you're likely to want to tackle in a rush before dashing off to work. On the other hand, the reusable filter is super eco-friendly—I’ve noticed a significant reduction in disposable waste. After several weeks of daily usage, I’ve made peace with the occasional hassle. The machine does remind me when cleaning is due, so at least I’m never left guessing.

**Competing Products**  
The Jura E6 offers stiff competition to Breville’s super-automatic machines. The key difference here is that Jura leans into crafting coffee with more aroma while Breville provides greater customization through manual controls. Folks who cherish semi-manual customization may prefer the latter, but I can’t argue with the convenience Jura provides with its pre-programmed options. Comparing it to the E4 from the same brand, the E6 is better suited for households that enjoy milk-based coffee beverages, even with its slightly underwhelming frother.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
This machine sits firmly in the premium range, and for someone with a penchant for exceptional coffee, it feels like a worthy investment. You’d expect it to feel high-priced, and it does until you sip that first cup brewed precisely to your preferences. Is there a cheaper option on the market? Sure, but this one’s combination of technology and user-friendliness left competitors falling short for me. Whether it’s designed to last fifteen years like other Jura users claim, time will tell, but everything thus far promises a long lifespan coupled with consistent brewing.

Planning a getaway for our 5 year wedding anniversary! This will be for February 2027. I know a ways out but I’d like to start researching now and maybe get some early deals. I’ve been to Atelier twice and loved it but get bored easily there. It’s far away from a lot of excursions and not much activity. Adults only would still be a must. 

So my top three criteria is as follows 

1) Food. Our standards are pretty high after Atelier. I know AI food isn’t always the best but anything comparable to atelier would be awesome. Bonus points if they have good room service and coffee. 

2) Location/things to do. Really would like to stay somewhere closer to more excursions. And somewhere that has more activities on resort. We are not night life people and have no interest in sitting around drinking all day. Only really would probably do one beach day. Also would love to check out Cozumel so close to there would be nice. 

3) Price. Xcaret Arte seems to fit what we want perfectly. Having access to all their parks is a huge plus. But almost $1000 a night is out of our price range. So any other resorts similar? Can we still get a good deal on Xcaret parks if we don’t stay at their resort? 

As a side note. We want to possibly do 7 nights at a resort and then maybe a few other nights at a regular hotel or Airbnb to extend our vacation without breaking bank. Anyone ever done this? Any recommendations? 

Our budget for the whole trip would probably be about $6000-$8000. Just my wife and I. Budget would include flights from Boston.

1lq76a2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lq76a2/i_thought_i_found_something_real/,I Thought I Found Something Real,"Hi people,

my name is Janos(31), and i'm from Hungary. After a bit of persuasion, i ended up in Germany as an electrician(a damn good one). My story of today begins here, in a small village near Harzgerode. I worked with the local electrical firm. Long story short, i wasn't made for this ""company"", i was always the overtime man, the anytime available man, the friday going home but received a call from boss:""can you do a favor?"" man. In return i was the too sensible and overfriendly dude in the ""team""(3 person), i was always responsible for everything shitty that happened. Because of my ""hungarian"" mentality, no one wanted to hang out or befriend me. Okay, no problem, i accepted it. But the time passed away, and now the ""team"" complained about my negative view and unfriendlyness or about the proper german knowledge. So i became the ""solo team"", who can repair anything anytime even after the working hours. Without extra pay as you can guess. I accepted to be the installation guy for Schranken barriers. I was from Kiel to Ducherow installing stupid barriers, for a few fucking thank yous. In the last few month my endurance and motivation declined and the bossman noticed it. He wanted to help but the euro signs were too tempting. We ended up with termination by mutual agreement. It was a rock, a boulder, a block of tungsten has fallen of my soul.

To anyone who has read this far, the best is yet to come. :D This is a vent, afterall.

So yes, the life goes on. One interview , one accepted, tomorrow one too. No worries.

But i'm not goint to vent about a fucking job, as my father said: ""There are thousands jobs available within reach, but we wont live for thousands of years.""

It happened on a day in march. My friend, his name is Janos too , informed me about a girl who is about to move next door. And he was positive that she is about to start a new life here, with her kids. After a few months, she was settled. I've seen her a few times before, she looked like a nice person. With two young boys, 4 and 5 years old. At first i didnt thought much of them. Okay new neighbours for my friend, not big deal. One day she needed somebody to install a tv on the wall and a shelf too. As shy as i ever could be, i've always pretended that i dont see her, but talked a little,how's going,it the rent expensive here, she showed me her apartment, the boys room and hers too. She was so sweet, she invite me to drink coffee,i politely declined. After a good few hours, i left. But then the kids started to show up. I'm a frequent guest at janos since we have the same crazy ideas for create something from junk :D The smaller boy, relatively fast ,became my friend. As my mother is a teacher in an elementary, i was always good with kids and i like them. They befriend me so fast, always. Dont know why :D He wants me to start thing, doesn't matter if it has an electric or combustible engine inside, he want to hear them idle. In my sould something awakened when he instinctly reached for my hand. I accepted it glady. I almost cried.

Why you ask? Love , relationship, these things with an other person, a girl or even a small kid. I havent learned them during my life. My head was always stuck in sand. And that is why i started this vent with work. I just cant relax, i dont know how to go with the flow, i'm working myself to the grave because this is my purpose. But that day, i've realised how much time i've wasted because of this. No family, no love, never tasted a kiss, not really felt unconditional love. And after i parted ways with my last company, i had enough time for think and think, and the harder i thought, the worse it became.

One day, received a call from my friend, he said the kids are looking for me: ""Wo ist Janos?"". The next day i was there all day long. It was a relatively cold day with rain and a bit of sunshine. I've talked with Jess -the other girl from upstair- about something when her kids showed up. It was a fun time. I like her kids too. I think we ate freshly picked cherries. Then the boy, ran over to the new girls door. He shouted her name, and she appeared. I was never so close to her. I thought I had to call an ambulance for my heart......sorry :D . The the other neighbour showed up, from next door. An older gentleman with glasses and. He is a friend of Janos and later my too. They talked and talked, bottles of beer started to show up to relieve my tension. It was getting dark, Jess moved inside with her kids. Only me, the girl, the old guy and my friend. In my shyness I said I was nervous to speak. Then he brought more beer. We sat down to drink and have a conversation. It was fun and awesome. The old guy with his calm presence, enouraged the girl to speak. Let us call the girl V., the old guy B..I've heard her story, 11 years of marriage, alcoholic husband, too much alone. They broke up 4 months ago. V. asked a few things from me too, how old are you, when is your birthday, do you have a girlfriend or wife, what is your goal. Unfortunately i cant lie, i said my goal it the provide for my family and then die. She was not amused :D It was getting late, my liver was actively breaking down the beer, hers too. Since it was obvious that i cant drink much, she said: "" I can drink you under the table anytime"". We shaked hands and I said: "" Name the time and place my friend."" . She laughed. I jokingly said that my father didnt asked me where i'm at. She said let us make a photo together. I accepted. I've felt something warm, and it wasn't the booze coursing through my veins. Netherless to say, B. poked my side nonstop to say something, and sometimes said: "" What a girl, she was made for you"". It felt good. We called it a day and when everybody left, me and V. stayed a bit longer, i asked her if she is available next week. She had to work, she is a altenpflege/elderly nurse. Hey ,but at least i've asked. I called it a day too.

If you still with me, thanks, and sorry if i'm wasting your time.

I tought of her every day, and at a steady pace, the chemicals began to work. That i havent felt in almost a decade. I wrote her a letter before this with hands that says: its a shame that we couldn't meet more often, and i have something for her and her kids , Dubai chocolate and a self made sound box for the kids, that plays engine sounds if you push the colour buttons. She answered a few hours after on instagram. It was the best 3 weeks of my life in the last few years . I went to Janos more and more often. Just to see her and play with the kids. We decided with the neighborhood to have a barbecue party every 2 weeks on the weekend, just to have fun, talk and eat good stuff. The first one was magical, i've played with the kids, B. made the BBQ-s, V. made the cocktails. We searched out places at the table. I ended up at the long bench with V. and the kids, Janos and B. on the single ones. We ate and talked, i cant describe how good that day was. As usual, a few beers, and we called it a day, it was already dark outside. The second grilling was a bit unusual. I played with the kids, and B and V started to talk and laugh and have fun without me. It felt strange but thought nothing of it. It was still a fun day, played with the kids, ate, laughed, the older kid made a huge bonfire. This is the point when it starts to feel something off. I've felt that while she is laughing with B. im looking after her kids and i cant say no to nobody so played along. The next week she started to avoid me, at least that is what i've felt. And the 3rd grilling, that was last weekend. It started as usual, starting the coalfire :D, grilling, talking, but now V. is on the other side of the table, next to B. talking about music and the DDR. Since i can read body language, when a girl facing with full body towards somebody, it means something. But it was B.. And i'm still looking after her kids. Later that night, a guest friend whispered to pay attention to both of them, he said he saw B. touching V., and poking her while both laugh. Just to be sure, V is 30, B is over 60. There are som much more that happened, and i was blind, just blind. Something broke inside me, something unmeasurable i've lost that night, my love and happiness. I drank myself blind, altough i hate alcohol and never was really drunk. I remembered the fun time we had, and realised, she is into that old dude. When i was proper drunk, i walked away, the small kid followed me instantly, he asked: ""wat makt du"", he cant say thing with S properly yet. I looked behing at him, he saw the enourmous tears in my eyes, i've reached for him, he took a step back. He felt something, that Janos who i was isn't there anymore. It broke my heart even more. And they had the audacity to ask me what is wrong. V. like the caring person she is, offered me some water to ease the drunkness. They called it a day and left, i was left there blind drunk crying.That night i owe my life to my friend who stole and hide my carkeyes, i wanted to end it all with a big crash, no seatbelt, full gas and my head over the middle console. I cried till 2 AM, if it's not for my sister, i would have ended it all. I could sleep, i was awful, not just my body,but my soul- if there is left any-. I wrote a letter to B. to have a good life with her, if that is what she wants, assgrabbing, side poking and pinching, cheek kissing.And to go fuck yourselfes hard. I threw it away before i could put it under his windshield wiper. I was so mad, i didnt think straight, i've redlined revved my car and left with tires squeling. I cried vigorously in the car to my mom, because she felt that something isn't right. Never ever cried like a child before my mom before. I did something that i wont forget, i wrote her a letter on insta. It says: Please excuse me behavior, i just cant express my feelings properly if i like somebody. And it is now clear that you are not in search of a man, but a sugardaddy. I wish you well and blah blah blah. It was much more than this, but i can share it if you want. She answered that i understood wrong everything, she isnt looking for a sugardaddy and it was rude of me. She is sorry but she is not in search for a better half, 11 years was enough now, maybe one day. And she is sorry that she gave me hopes and was not intentional. She likes me though but in that way. She will be very sorry if I don't come anymore.

Yeah the hell you will. To my best knowledge, they drove away that day almost simultaneous and made something together with the kids.

I'm broken since that day. I know i was the shitty person here, like always the man. Since this shit left my brain, im much better. Thank you if you read it though and could resonate with me. Or just simply judge me, it doesnt hurt me anymore.",1,1751489927.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

He moved to Spain with me from the US for 6 years and to a few different states. he rides around the city with me in a backpack on my moped. He travels all over for work with me, even in helicopters and once in a private plane. He comes everywhere.

• 1 teaspoon of vanilla sugar,
• 1 teaspoon of potato starch,

There's a in-game chat for better coordination, elections for both the president (which proposes wars) and congress (which votes if we do indeed go to war or not). 

You get rewarded for taking part in wars regardless if you pick the loser or the winner, or if you are or not from the country.

1lq6m20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1lq6m20/i_may_have_ruined_something_special_and_i_cant/,I may have ruined something special and I can't stop thinking about it,"Around a year ago, I, currently 19F, was assigned to a biology project with a guy I’ve never spoken to. However I got sick, so we had to complete it through texting, so we never talked in real life. Ever since then every once in a couple of months he would send me something random - an image, a message, without any further context. I would send something back and usually the conversation wouldn’t go that much further. Over our senior year he made a habit of this, and we even gained an inside joke. At school I would always see him glance in my direction; we would cross paths, but never talk; we had mutual friends, but yet we still never interacted. He was always there, near me - in school photos, during dance practice, parties, lunch but we never had the courage to say anything. This made me curious, intrigued, even. He was a typically shy, polite,  kind of quiet guy that doesn’t speak to girls much, however you could still consider him as ‘’popular’’ since a lot of people knew him. I guess this made me confused, whether our interactions were just funny bits, or if something more was lying beneath.

After our last day at school I felt like I missed out on something bigger, maybe better; some sort of light hope. I decided to text him something first, for a change. It was something completely random, but he ignored it, and started talking about how sad he was about school ending, how he realized he can’t change anything, and gave an example of how he never said hi to me. I told him that he still has time to change some things, and he told me not to give him too much hope. This felt a bit ambiguous, I wasn’t sure anymore if he was talking about us or exams, since he quickly made a comment on how ‘’exams aren’t the end of the world’’. 

A week passed since this interaction and he texted me, made some small talk and broke the ice by asking if I ever wanted to hang out with him, and admitted that he didn’t have the courage and ‘’time’’ to come up to me irl. We agreed to go to our local music festival, since music was a shared interest of ours.

We met up. It was quite awkward at first, I will not lie. I was also very tired, and he seemed extremely nervous. I tried to ask him questions, try my best to make him feel comfortable (however it was difficult since I am closed off, an introvert and not much of a yapper) and eventually he eased up a bit. We made a stop at a coffee shop, he held the door for me and I think he might’ve tried to pay for me..And looked embarrassed when I paid for myself. He was staring at me, I joked that he was staring into my soul and he quickly looked away and apologized. When we went to the concert it was quite chill, however we didn’t talk or move much. After hours, and hours of just standing we took a walk, he opened up, we went back and started dancing, laughing, etc. It started to rain and he took out his umbrella and I stood under it he encouraged me to come closer. He walked me back home, I apologized if he felt bored with me, to which he said ‘’of course not’’, and I told him that if he ever has any more spontaneous ideas, that I’m here.

The night wasn’t perfect, of course, but it didn’t seem like a fail. It was sweet and innocent. 

A couple of days later we had exam consultations and he held the door open for me (even when I was still walking up to the building!)tried to lightly converse with me, however after a few exchanged words I walked away…Stupid of me, I know. But his friend was there and I didn’t want to intrude. I guess he also started to make me nervous. Same thing happened after an exam - we walked out at the same time, started talking, but then his friend came and I stepped away. I just hope he doesn’t think that I didn’t want to speak with him, or that I was embarrassed to be seen with him, because that’s not true at all. 

I texted him something random the next day and we made some jokes. He referenced our inside joke, and I think he might’ve made a light, subtle flirtatious comment(in his own, awkward, shy way). However I was too scared that I misinterpreted it, so I asked him to elaborate, and he changed the topic. I don’t know if this is because he thought I didn’t understand his comment/rejected him and then he got embarrassed and backed away, or if he just thinks I’m stupid. 

More than a week passed without any kind of message from him. I started to really overthink. Did he just not like me? Did he like me, but then realized I’m not that interesting? Or did he think I rejected him and he got embarrassed of his efforts? 

I decided to finally message him. I opened with an inside joke, and then asked him to hang out, to which he agreed. I’m not sure if it was because of his own politeness, or because he actually wanted to see me. It almost seemed like he was more dry than usual, but I can't be completely sure, since he has a strange, unique way of texting, so I may be overthinking. 

The day we met I was tired once again, barely had any sleep; also, my cat got really sick, so I was extremely upset. I was quiet most of the time, but I still tried to ask him questions. At one point I didn’t even need to be encouraging him, since he started telling his own stories, asking me things. Even though there were long quiet pauses, he still talked. But it didn’t feel like the first time we met up. The flirty tension wasn’t there, and basically nothing happened. Our conversations were light, distant. This is why I’m not sure if he even likes me anymore, or if he did so to begin with. There’s a huge chance he just agreed out of politeness. Or maybe he now felt distant, because he thought I viewed our relationship in a strictly platonic manner. He asked me how come I decided to ask him to meet, and I said that it was a spontaneous idea and I just wanted to get out of the house (a total lie, which probably made me seem even more uninterested). Idk, I also feel like I appeared shallow and slow. He would say something deeper, more philosophical, and I would just respond with a joke, a hum, or just bluntly agree (which is not like me at all??? I guess I was really that tired.) This could’ve added to his interest cutback (or maybe he is still interested and i'm just insecure - i dont even know anymore). When we split I decided to text him and I told him that maybe my invite wasn’t as spontaneous as I told him that it was. He reacted to it with a heart and now for the past 5 days it’s been quiet. The next day I went out on a walk alone with a full night's sleep and thought of all the things I could have said, could've done, how I should have been nicer, more initiative, how I should hide myself less, let myself express my thoughts and so forth and so on. I also noticed that he has pretty low self confidence, so i felt bad that i didn't tell him anything encouraging. I don't know, I just feel like I failed. 

I’m not even sure what I’m asking here. I guess some sort of confirmation that he did like me? But even then, it doesn't help. Does he seriously think I rejected him? Or did he just lose his interest, realizing I was quite boring and not as fun as I was through text? I just feel sad now, because it feels like i missed out on something genuinely good. School is over, it’s summer and we might never see each other ever again. We actually have quite a lot in common . he’s also nice, funny, caring, smart, doesn’t judge. It feels like I got my hopes up and then ruined something before it even started, or realized how good it is way too late. Damn me and my avoidant tendencies. 
I'm scared of messaging him first again since i don't want to seem too pushy, but what if it just ends like that? What if he decided to back away and won't text me ever again?

I live half time in Europe and half in USA. I promise myself when in each I have a must get done list. My USA list of things to do is so boring but can only be finished here! 
So here is my pattern. First week or so I knock a few things out. Then I get sucked into TV as I don’t have that in Europe in rentals. For instance besides feeding myself & coffee, I’ve done nothing today not even dishes. My house is messy here because it’s small and to much stuff & I think my environment makes me depressed. I promised myself I would pay someone to remove a chair that takes up half my livingroom but haven’t yet! Why, because my luggage lies unpacked on the floor. It’s compounding for sure. I need to just set a timer and push 15 minutes right? I sound so pathetic typing this. 
When I have deadlines I get so much done quickly. Like taxes before leaving the countries. I make deadlines. 
How do you immediately jump out of bed and do a task to get yourself going? I did give up gaming which was a crazy obligation of nothingness. 
Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been very accomplished in life. Both my homes are completely paid off on my own. But I’ve had a lot of medical setbacks.

1lq6lkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1lq6lkv/early_june_2025_trip_report_two_weeks_as_a_family/,Early June 2025 Trip report - two weeks as a family of 4 with two tweens,"Had an incredible two weeks enjoying Italy last month.  It was our first BIG family trip (international, longer than a week, etc.) for our family- two 40s parents, a 12 year-old, and an 11 year-old.  While planning the trip, I asked my family what one thing they would each like to do/see on our trip, and got the following: 

* Husband: eating pizza in Naples
* Me: visiting as many museums as possible
* Daughter: enjoying a beach day
* Son: seeing the Leaning Tower of Pisa

I tried to plan our itinerary so that we wouldn't have two crazy busy days in a row, and we would have a balance of cultural/""boring"" things with some kid-centric items.  I think we had a good schedule overall and wanted to share it in case others might find it useful.

**Rome: Days 1-5**

* Sat 5/30: arrived in the evening, took a cab into the city, and walked over to Trastevere from our rental apartment for dinner and gelato.  Decided to have the kids rank each gelateria on our trip, so this was a nice ongoing theme during our vacation
* Sun 6/1: Woke up super early (jetlagged; flew in from California).  Got a quick breakfast and did a fun semi-private tour of the city with [MariaClaudia Tours](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d23659647-Reviews-Mariaclaudia_Tours-Rome_Lazio.html).  Kids had a lot of fun and kept them engaged.  Saw the Trevi Fountain (the new line system worked great for us- managed to get a ton of pictures without anyone in the background and everyone gave others some distance), outside of the Pantheon (it was Free Sunday so we skipped going inside due to crazy lines), Piazza Navona.  Took an afternoon break and then grabbed a taxi to [Gladiator School](https://www.romegladiatorschool.com/gladiator-school) for the kids. They had a lot of fun, but since we had the last booking of the day, there weren't any other participants.  On one hand, it was fun for them to have a private class, but I think they would have enjoyed competing against other kids.  Got another cab back into the city and asked to get dropped off at the Spanish Steps, climbed up for a great sunset view, then got dinner.
* Mon 6/2: Slept in and missed the Republic Day parade/flyover, but enjoyed a lazy morning and afternoon.  Had a 2pm Holy Door reservation at St. Peter's Basilica, but our app confirmation was ignored by multiple Iubilaeum volunteers/workers, so we got routed through the general line.  Walked over to the Vatican Museum entry afterwards for our 3:30pm tour time.  We got an email about a week before our trip saying that the Sistine Chapel would be closed for our tour date, and we weren't allowed to make any exchanges, so we were a little bummed about that.  Museums were incredible and crowds were a little lighter than I expected, so it was a pleasant experience overall.  We paid for the Happy Hour tickets during check out, which wasn't really worth the cost IMO. Ordering items a la carte from the cafe menu would have worked out better for our family.
* Tue 6/3: Busy day today - had an 8am train from Roma Termini to Napoli Centrale.  Booked 4 months out and got Business Class seats (kids were free!) for all of our Frecciarossa/Trenitalia trains.  Seats were comfortable and high speed trains were great overall. The Circumvesuviana was another story.  Was super packed, there was a pickpocket on board (luckily, we didn't get anything taken), but made it to Pompei just fine.  Had a private tour booked with [Luca Tour Guide](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187785-d13276793-Reviews-Luca_Tour_Guide-Naples_Province_of_Naples_Campania.html) and he was fantastic!  Learned a lot and he kept the kids engaged.  Took the Circumvesuviana back to Naples and got pizza at da Michele on the new side (we really liked it!  I know everyone here says they're not the best, but we enjoyed it).  Joked with my husband that we could've gotten the same pizza 25 miles from home instead of flying 6,000+.  Wandered around the streets of Napoli for a bit (my son got to try a ""Cosce Aparte"" - lemonade with open legs-  then took a tour with [Naples Underground](https://www.napolisotterranea.org/en/).  Decent tour overall, but wish we could've done the [Adventure Tour](https://www.galleriaborbonica.com/en/tours/adventure) with Galleria Borbonica instead.  Took the last train back to Rome.
* Wed 6/4: Slept in a bit and had a late morning semi-private tour of the Colosseum with [MariaClaudia Tours](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187791-d23659647-Reviews-Mariaclaudia_Tours-Rome_Lazio.html).  Went to the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill afterwards, then grabbed a taxi to Galleria Borghese and had a tour booked through the museum.  Loved LOVED seeing all of the Bernini sculptures in person, as well as the Caravaggio and Raphael paintings.  Learned about how shady Scipione Borghese was from our tour guide, so that was interesting.  Finished off the day with a stop to the Pantheon and got tickets easily to go inside right before closing (no lines).

**Florence: Days 6-10**

* Thu 6/5: Grabbed a cab to the train station and took the 10am train to Florence.  Our apartment wasn't ready yet, but we were able to drop off our bags before exploring on our own a bit.  Kids enjoyed the merry-go-round at the Piazza Della Repubblica, walked to the Ponte Vecchio, wandered some more, and stopped by a couple of wine windows (they also sell spritzes).  Had a timed entry to Galleria dell'Accademia to see the David.  Kids got a kick out of seeing a small statue of [Stitch ](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/lilo-and-stitch-galleria-dell-accademia-graceland-2648983)in the museum, too.  Had some Bistecca Alla Fiorentina at an great little restaurant right downstairs from our apartment.
* Fri 6/6: an AMAZING day trip to Tuscany for a [farm lunch & swim experience](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/66243) at an agriturismo.  Would do this again and again.  They had a host meet us at the train station to buy local train tickets, picked us up at the station and drove us to their farm, and were amazing hosts all around.  We walked through their property, picked vegetables for our lunch, cooked together, and swam in their gorgeous infinity pool after our delicious meal.  Our hosts were great with our kids, and they also had an adorable dog on property that everyone loved.  After getting back to town, we took a cab up to Piazzale Michelangelo for sunset.
* Sat 6/7: Early morning tickets to Uffizi Galleries-- kids were honestly museumed-out at this point.  Was great to get there early to avoid the crowds (we had plenty of rooms all to ourselves).  Found an American breakfast spot to eat and the kids were stoked for eggs & bacon, and I was happy to have my first iced coffee in a week.  Took a little break at the apartment during the early afternoon and then walked down to the Duomo for our 4:15pm dome climb.  Not going to lie- the climb wasn't easy, but all of the stairs leading up to our apartments kind of prepared us for it.  My husband did hit his head a few times (he's 6'3""), but the views from the top were worth it.  Rewarded ourselves with an affogato from [Vivoli ](https://vivoli.it/en/)afterwards (tip: you can skip the longer line at the cafe side and order your affogato from the gelato side and save yourself about 30-45 minutes).   Finished off the day with dinner at ZaZa (touristy, yes- but also delicious)-- the clam soup was one of my favorite meals on our trip.
* Sun 6/8: Did a private gelato making class (was just ok, not really worth the cost IMO), and spent more time wandering the city.  My husband and kids climbed Giotto's Bell Tower while I enjoyed the A/C in our apartment.  I picked up a perfume at [Farmaceutica Santa Maria Novella](https://us.smnovella.com/) as my souvenir for the trip.  Some more wandering, the four of us found a [Fotoautomatica ](https://www.theflorentine.net/2022/02/10/4%C2%BD-minutes-the-story-behind-fotoautomatica/)and got a strip as another souvenir.  Another merry-go-round ride to finish off our last evening in the city.

**Cinque Terre: Days 11-12**

* Mon 6/9: booked another mid-morning train and got off at Pisa Centrale, where we stored our bags at a local luggage storage business (booked online ahead of time for cheaper rates, fully automated lockers, no actual people working on site). Walked to the Leaning Tower and took the standard tourist photos before our tower climb reservation.  Got interesting the higher we went up the stairs, as you could really feel the lean.  Grabbed a quick lunch before walking back to retrieve our bags and hop on our next train to Monterosso. Once we got to town, it was about a 10-minute walk to our apartment.  Dropped off our bags and enjoyed the free beach at old town for a couple of hours before meeting Guiliano for our [private boat tour](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187820-d12919510-Reviews-Calipso_Boat_Tour-Monterosso_al_Mare_Cinque_Terre_Italian_Riviera_Liguria.html) of the coast.
* Tue 6/10: I had booked timed entry tickets for 10:30a for [Via Dell'Amore](https://www.viadellamore.info/en) part of the Blue Trail, but the kids were tired so we skipped it (and wasted about 100 Euro with the tickets and train passes).  Husband went down to reserve a couple of umbrellas at Bagno Eden and we lucked out with first row sunbeds.  Spent the day at the beach (I brought floating rings and water shoes from home) and finished off the day with dinner at a lovely restaurant in town.

**Venice: Days 13-15**

* Wed 6/11: This was our longest travel day in Italy - 2 trains and 7 hours.  Took the first train into Milan, then had a quick 15-minute transfer to our 2nd train.  Luckily, all trains were on time and we had reserved seating and our luggage was always stored near our seats.  We didn't have time to grab any food at the Milan station, and the offerings at the cafe car were slim (they ran out of pizza 20 minutes into the 3 hour ride), so I would suggest bringing your own meal if possible.  We were met by our lovely host at the train station in Venice, and he guided us to the apartment (one vaparetto stop away).  Dropped off our bags, walked around the island (Rialto Bridge, Grand Canal, etc.).
* Thu 6/12: Explored the city some more.  Walked over to the[ Libreria Acqua Alta ](https://www.libreriacqualta.it/en/)and saw a couple of the bookstore cats.  Ventured to Piazza San Marco, saw a bunch of anti-Bezos flyers and banners, enjoyed a spritz by the water, and went on a gondola ride.
* Fri 6/13: Took the kids to [Museo di Storia Naturale di Venezia](https://msn.visitmuve.it/en/home/) and saw some interesting exhibits.  Wandered around the city again and enjoyed our last meal in Italy.

Overall, had a great time and made a ton of memories as a family.  Here are the apartments we booked (all of them were great) in case it's helpful to anyone.

She used to be a friend of mine and she used to date a friend of mine as well as my friend Steve’s former best friend let’s call him Gino so during their entire relationship, she’s  cheated on him she’s gaslit him. She’s manipulated him and she’s hurt him over and over and over again yet he still stays. He still loves her not seeing that she is obviously a narcissist and an energetic vampiric sex addict. My friend let’s call him Dave who she dated for five years, likely dated at the same time that they were dating so she two timed them. And boy this gets messy. It’s a long one, but strap in you’re in for a ride.

So I’ve known Julia probably for like seven or eight years maybe she and I and her boyfriend are all in the cosplay community in Los Angeles and this girl has quite the reputation for being a known THOT that can’t keep her legs closed and keeps them open 24/7 like 7-Eleven. She’s cheated on every guy that she’s been with. I lost count of how many times she’s cheated on Stefan and I’ve lost all of my respect for her that I ever had and now I can’t stand her because she continues to hurt my friend and he is even more naïve because he doesn’t wake up and see that she is narcissistically abusing him using him as a source of validation and making false promises to him to change. That’s typically what a narcissist does so last few years one of the break ups they had because let’s just be real. Their relationship is worse than an emotional roller coaster so up and down so off and on they might as well call themselves the light switch couple. Julia reminds me of a human version of a slip and slide. If you know what I mean. One minute he’s done with her the next he wants her back, one minute she cheats on him the next she’s sorry and will never do it again yet she Continues to do it again and again and again it gives Katy Perry‘s hot and cold, and tbh I kind of think she had some sort of childhood trauma that caused her to be addicted to sex and become a narcissist because that’s usually how it starts. In a way I feel bad for her and I pity her and I really feel sorry for him for being her victim. Anyway I’m not trying to judge her, but I can’t help but judge her because this is my friend and she purposely does this to him and she lies to him and manipulate him into thinking that she has changed when she hasn’t and the worst thing is is that my friend is extremely naïve impressionable And has very low self-esteem. He told me that he likes Asian girls because he likes the Asian culture and anime cosplay and things like that and he basically reminds me of my younger self before I met my future husband. Nice story is that I’ve dated three Filipino guys. One was half white half Filipino and all of them treated me like shit. They cheated on me. They lied to me well one of them. It turns out he hasn’t cheated, but he still lied to me about wanting to get married Back in 2009. I was at a family party at my grandma‘s house and keep in mind I am clairvoyant and so is my grandma‘s neighbor. I asked her when and where I would meet my future husband. It was very very vague and it made me assume that I was going to meet my future husband in Japan She only described my now amazing boyfriends looks and our future together she didn’t specify whether or not he was Japanese before a long time. I assumed that he would be Japanese and that I would be going over to Japan to meet him or he would be any Asian guy, right? But I continuously gotten my heartbroken by the Asian guys that I’ve dated or even liked and it’s not to say that Asian guys are bad. They are absolutely not not all of them anyway there’s a bad seed in every race that brings me to my next point he shouldn’t be dating her just for her race. She’s treating him like shit he reminds me of a younger version of myself so dumb, so naïve so willing to believe everything. A very much of people pleaser a recovering people pleaser like you are yourself Charlotte so the reason he is staying with her it’s pretty pathetic to be honest he is only staying with her because she was the only Asian girl to give him the time of day. I said so you’re going to allow yourself to be treated like shit Stefan because she’s Asian and she meets the aesthetic that you like it’s OK to have a type, but it doesn’t mean that that person that matches your physical type is a good person. It’s gonna be your fault if you continue to allow yourself to stay in a situation where you know that she hurts you fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me. I told him he is naïve and being stupid and dumb and blind, and I’m not trying to put him down. I’m trying to get him to wake up and smell the coffee and smell the roses and see the truth take off the rose colored glasses and realize that his love is blind therefore, he can see all the red flags. 🚩 when he said that he’s staying with her because she’s Asian and she was the only Asian girl to give him a chance I asked him. Do you hear yourself right now?  That was the stupidest reason I’ve ever heard!! How are you not embarrassed?? And ask for her constantly cheating on him how are you not embarrassed as well Julia ?! The first break up. I remember them having was because she cheated on him and then him and I and a group of friends we call ourselves the SoCal cosplayers got together, and I posted a profile picture of us on Facebook that day. When I got home that was the day I broke up with my neglectful ex too, February 17th 2024 because he had been in Mexico on Valentine’s Day, and I was waiting for him to make plans with me when he came back and he failed to do so and every time I wanted to go out on a date with him, he would complain about money and he would complain about having to pay for me so Stefan and I both went through breakups and we were kind of vulnerable and we hung out with each other by ourselves after the gathering too. It was sweet we’ve went to ihop and he walked me home and stuff and it was just random, but at IHOP I told him I was proud of him for leaving her in the dust and not to take her back again lo and behold I was disappointed but there were some sparks between us, but then it just didn’t pan out anyway probably because we were both vulnerable so back to my thought when she saw that profile picture, she betrayed me. She turned her back on me and blocked me All because she felt guilty for what she did to him and didn’t wanna see her exes face. So tell me WHY they keep getting back together?! I learned in high school the first time I was cheated on and the second time by the same guy never to take a cheater back ever!! Once a cheater always a cheater unless there’s a drastic change and they have a come to Jesus moment!! Tell me why he’s now been engaged to her twice why she continues blocking him on social media after trying to get with another man, including his former best friend Gino That she also used to date. Last year, my friend Dave was engaged to this woman named Sarah. It turns out she lied to him about everything when they were married, but nobody supported that relationship very much because it was too fast apparently and his parents did not like her at all so when they were engaged, Julia was messaging him on Facebook. I was there. I witnessed this myself. She was threatening him that if he didn’t dump his fiancé and have sex with her and help her CHEAT ON STEFAN that she would take him to court and sue him with an attorney and this had him very worried. His parents had previously called Julia a psycho cause she was when they were dating. She did something really bad at their house to cause them to kick her out. As for the messaging she did that and then she told him that Stefan was worthless to her, and the last guy she would ever want to marry that he’s her last resort not first choice and that she’s only settling for him because she can’t have Dave anymore and I witnessed this with my own two eyes. 👀 

I offered to help he said not to worry about it, and I kept asking him for like three days if I can tell Stefan , because he’s my friend and that’s the right thing to do even if him and Dave are not friends and don’t get along or like each other. I managed to convince him to do the right thing he finally gave in to my wishes on the third day and I told Stefan on video chat when we were all at Target 🎯 with Dave and his now ex-wife! Steve couldn’t believe it and he hung up on me next thing I know I was blocked then the next thing I know after that, Dave gets a message from Julia on Facebook apologizing after lying to Stefan telling him that she didn’t do it. The bitch was trying to cover her tracks. I know a narcissist when I see one. Tell me why when I tell Stefan what she was doing with my friend Dave Gino threatens to beat me up?! First of all I can take him. I am well-versed in karate, tai chi taekwondo wool shoe kickboxing regular boxing wrestling and street fighting I’m stronger and I’m bigger than him just because I’m a woman looking out my friend don’t think I can’t get a leg up on you, Shorty and he’s known to have beaten up his ex-girlfriends before. Gino is a piece of shit human and when I saw this message on TikTok, I reported him after telling his ass off and called him, a woman abuser, and a wife beater and I blocked him and his account got banned. Apparently, he’s been doing this to other people too other than me and his exes. I said you’re a real winner aren’t you and I called him a loser.

So I messaged Stefan on TikTok because he hasn’t blocked me there I told him everything when he unblocked me on Facebook I showed him the screenshot of what Gino was doing to me for telling him the truth and looking out for him because Gino was 100% on his ex-girlfriend Julia‘s side. So he was a yes, man playing favorites. A real best friend would wake up and tell his friend to wise up and leave the bitch. Like I have been. Steve apologized for not listening to me and for blocking me and that he realizes that as a friend, I was looking out for his well-being like I still am but he refuses to listen to me or my advice. He continuously tries to convince me that she won’t do it again and that she’s never lied to him. I’m not buying it. So I haven’t spoken to Gino since last year someone randomly invited me to his birthday party. I declined after telling them what happened. They also confirmed that he did beat up his ex-girlfriend not Julia, but another one, but I wouldn’t be surprised if he did it to her too especially if she cheated on him and I know that she did. Because when she was dating Gino, she was dating my friend Dave and he found out. Which caused the psychotic incident at his house. She was throwing dishes, throwing things yeah his parents kicked her ass out of there. Or so I’ve heard. So as of late, Stefan and Julia were engaged last year in December me and other people told me he was making the biggest mistake of his life. I still think he is he broke up with her after she had blocked him and cheated on him again ON CHRISTMAS Who the hell does that to their partner on Christmas and then they got back together were engaged again the same fucking thing happened and then now they’re back together again and I’m assuming that they’re still engaged. I again how are you not embarrassed?!  I keep trying to convince him that she is all wrong for him that she is all talk and that he has low self-esteem to keep taking a cheater back. I can tell he has low self-esteem based on the reason alone that he is staying with her he likes Asian women and she was the only Asian woman to give him a chance and that he couldn’t find any other Asian woman that would that is incredibly immature and very desperate . He refuses to listen he’s very wishy-washy about his decisions to dump her. He’s blinded by love. He can’t see that she’s a narcissist just using him for validation. I think he’s very confused and doesn’t really know what he wants and that he is settling for less. I’m trying to save him from this bad toxic relationship or he’s just gonna keep getting hurt but he chooses to stay with her because she’s Asian not realizing that this bitch is just going to keep making him feel worse about himself because she’s just going to keep cheating on him if she doesn’t get therapy . I fully firmly 100% believe that she’s just a narcissistic energy vampire that’s using him doesn’t care about his feelings like she told Dave and is treating him like a last resort like she also told Dave, that she doesn’t know what she wants either and that she needs serious help like therapy. I know you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. I told him he’s being blind, foolish and stupid for continuing to stay with somebody he knows is going to hurt him. He claims that she’s never lied to him . I called bullshit on that. I pointed out that her cheating on him was one 1000% lying and her promising to never do it again is 1000% lying and it’s pure manipulation so she could control him into staying in a relationship where she gets the validation that she craves as a narcissist and I reminded him of when she lied to him about the situation with Dave last year and apologized to Dave behind his back. And that she doesn’t care about his feelings and continues on and on and on to emotionally and mentally abuse him. He’s my friend and I’m afraid of him getting hurt for the rest of his life I’m worried about him I don’t want him to go down the same path I did and almost continued on and I just want him to be happy and have self-worth higher self-esteem big-time confidence and to realize that he is a KING 👑 That deserves better.   I am in a soulmate, relationship where I am happy. So in case y’all were going to tell me, I’m jealous. That’s not true at all. I’m just guessing you might’ve thought that. He reminds me of the younger version of myself and I had to learn the hard way. I dumped my last narcissist last year before I met my sweet soulmate William I want the same thing for him, and for him to realize his worth and see it and know that he is a king who deserves a real queen not a pauper who is leaving him for breadcrumbs. She’s breadcrumbing him, gaslighting him and manipulating and lying to him. He won’t listen to me and he refuses to open his eyes and see it because he wants to stay with someone that he thinks he’s beautiful based on her race. What should I do? I am a good friend who just wants to protect my friends from getting hurt unnecessarily.",2,1751488399.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,0.75,False

That’s all he’s hit me up about.

I eventually stopped talking to him, he stopped messaging me so I thought that was that.

Today he messaged me like “sooo are you not Allowed to talk to me anymore or somethin” and when I told him I didn’t want to talk, we were never friends and I was expecting a baby with my bf so he wasn’t my priority he said “maybe we can be friends in another few years and meet up”…

A friend told me about something they’d been adding to their coffee every morning. It’s not a shake or pill, just a tiny scoop of natural stuff. I figured it couldn’t hurt to try.

After a couple weeks, I started noticing I didn’t crash as hard, wasn’t as hungry all the time, and my energy felt... smoother. Not like a buzz, just steady. My clothes started fitting a little better too, which was a nice bonus.

I wasn’t even planning to talk about this, but honestly? It helped more than I thought it would. So I’m putting it out there in case it helps someone else.

YES, some of it is just age. I know this. But lately I've been looking so tired, so bad and a lot of it has to due with chronic puffiness of the eyelids. Not a good look. And under my eyes are now simultaneously hollow in some places, puffy in others. It's hard to explain, but if you know you know.

I already do the following:

\* Tretinoin 4-5 nights a week

\*My CurrentBody2 mask 5 times a week

\*TCA peels a couple of times a year

\*Excellent skincare (I do alternate products, but they are all effective/proven).

\*Just okay sleep, but I'm working on it.

Some of you might remember my earlier posts about a project I was building—an open-source way to create local AI agents. I've been tinkering, coding, and taking in all your amazing feedback for months. Today, I'm incredibly excited (and a little nervous!) to announce that **Observer AI v1.0 is officially launching this Friday!**

For anyone who missed it, **Observer AI 👁️** is a privacy-first platform for building your own micro-agents that run locally on your machine.

The whole idea started because, like many of you, I was blown away by the power of local models but wanted a simple, powerful way to connect them to my own computer—to let them see my screen, react to events, and automate tasks without sending my screen data to cloud providers.

**This Project is a Love Letter to Ollama and This Community**

**Observer AI would not exist without Ollama.** The sheer accessibility and power of what the Ollama team has built was what gave me the vision of this project.

And more importantly, it wouldn't be what it is today without **YOU**. Every comment, suggestion, and bit of encouragement I've received from this community has directly shaped the features and direction of Observer. You told me what you wanted to see in a local agent platform, and I did my best to build it. So, from the bottom of my heart, **thank you.** 

**The Launch This Friday**

The core Observer AI platform is, and will always be, **free and open-source**. That's non-negotiable.

To help support the project's future development (I'm a solo dev, so server costs and coffee are my main fuel!), I'm also introducing an optional **Observer Pro** subscription. This will give users unlimited access to the hosted Ob-Server models for those who might not be running a local instance 24/7. It's my way of trying to make the project sustainable long-term.

I'd be incredibly grateful if you'd take a look. Star the repo if you think it's cool, try building an agent, and let me know what you think. I'm building this for you, and your feedback is what will guide v1.1 and beyond.

1.	The wood is way lighter than the rest of the furniture, which is more of a caramel oak. (My mum says this is okay so it doesn’t look like a full set, but I’m still hesitant.) 
2.	The height is pretty tall, so I was considering cutting the legs to make it more proportionate with everything else (while still being able to sit on the floor and eat on it).

I’m visiting my grandmother soon—she recently had a stroke, and while she’s thankfully doing well, I want to bring her something special for her birthday.

She’s an active, tough, no-nonsense European woman who’s never been into sentimental or “cutesy” things. She’s still able to walk and do light exercise, but she has limited use of her left side now. She also enjoys cooking (though things like opening jars or chopping are harder now), going to the movies, and drinking coffee.



I’m planning to crochet her a gift—but more importantly, I want it to be something useful or comforting that can genuinely help her in some way, whether physically or emotionally. It doesn’t have to be crochet-specific, either—if you have ideas of helpful items in general for someone recovering from a stroke, I’d love to hear those too!



Thank you so much for any ideas!

It all started last year when I broke up with my boyfriend. During the relationship, I had a desire to get to know a guy, and not because I liked him, but because we were in the same council, school, and even gym, where I could hear his opinions on certain situations, which made me interested in him. He seemed like a very interesting person, but I didn't start communicating with him in my relationship with my boyfriend, because at that time he didn't trust me and was very jealous of men. Our relationship was already at such a point that at a certain point in time I really began to realize that I was much more comfortable with that guy. In general, my relationship with my ex ended on a very negative note. So after the end of the relationship, I asked this guy to go for a walk. It was stupid, because I needed to move away from the previous relationship to start communicating with others normally. But I still invited him to a meeting and we had a really good time together. At the second or third meeting, he tried to take my hand, but I was uncomfortable with it, because I was still in love with my ex and not ready for a new relationship. Our communication continued during a very bright period of my life. I tried to get back into a relationship with my ex, I moved, switched from offline to online education because of the situation with my ex and the attitude of my peers. Despite my attempts to peacefully return the relationship (I think I was so attached to him, because it was my first teenage crush and a huge affection, he was the only one I trusted so much, at that time I was already living alone, so he was the closest), he ruined me, he ruined my friendship with my friend, he spread rumors about me, so my peers began to treat me worse. This friend watched all of this and tried to help me forget the guy, told me to let go, told me that he liked me. And I was glad to have him around, but his desire for a relationship was only killing me and aggravating the situation. I needed to end this friendship because I was still in love with my ex, and this friend fell in love with me.  My life started to develop in the same concept, I graduated from school, moved to another city, found a job and new friends. This friend lived with me for some time because he worked in the same company as me, which only further destroyed our relationship. I was constantly on emotions because of the feelings I hadn't experienced yet, my work was a mess, my relationship with my parents and his feelings were strained. Eventually, he went to study in another country and we decided that I could move to him too. I moved to another country, rented a room and everything was fine. But I started a course of systemic retinoids (to treat acne) and because of unemployment and some other difficulties, I started to be very unstable. The pills made me anxious, I was afraid to leave my room, I drank energy drinks and coffee and didn't sleep at night. My nervous system was killed and against this background, my relationship with my parents deteriorated, I had unresolved feelings towards my ex (I started to let go) because of this friend's feelings towards me and my unexplained feelings of guilt towards him, unemployment, etc. At one point, my friend got tired of it and stopped communicating with me. He said that I didn't care about him, that I ignored his words or his emotional state. We stopped communicating, although I tried to communicate several times, but he said he would block me if I continued to write. Then we had only a documentary relationship (he helped me pay for my apartment, because at that time I returned to the country). I stopped the SR course because of the surgery, I felt better. I started to take care of myself and when I met with my ex, I realized that I no longer loved him. My relationship with my parents was still tense, but it was better. When I returned to the country where this ex-friend was a few months later, I felt a huge sadness for him and so I decided to write to him. He said that he had lost his trust, that I had ignored his condition, that I had to learn to live on my own and learn to change if something about me puts people off. I tried to show him my changes, but it was all in vain, he was not interested. Now I'm not trying to get him back, I'm letting it go, realizing that everyone has their own choice and path. I would like to emphasize that all this time he said that he loved me and that he wanted a relationship, because everyone has it and he wants to feel it too. Despite the sympathy that began to arise for him, I did not start a relationship with him, because this thesis was strange and there were a couple of other strange moments that I would not like to have in my relationship. He had negative comments about his ex. We had some misunderstandings in the relationship and we had different views on many things. He started therapy with a psychologist and, as I understand it, is going through a difficult period because of this. I have let it go, but I am always ready to communicate and communicate. 

So am I a bad person for destroying my former friend's morale because of the rejection of the relationship and my emotional state?

Machinery: the Schaerer Ambiente is the espresso machine that the business was instructed to buy. It’s definitely dated, and Google searches will tell you that it’s been discontinued. Fortunately, I do have access to its manual- but my issue is that one of the drainage tubes is pouring out espresso grounds, which then struggle to drain. The shots are also inconsistently sized. I have no knowledge of how this machine was treated in the past, or how to begin to diagnose it. The closest repair technician is over an hour away, and charges $300 for travel + diagnostics (which the business owners are not too jazzed about). 

Coffee brand: Royal Cup is their distributor. I was unfamiliar, so more online searches result in half of the internet saying it’s reliable and good, and the other half saying they wouldn’t serve it to prisoners. I do have the ability to switch roasters, and would prefer to go local. I can’t tell if the machine is the reason for the weak tasting espresso, if it’s just Royal Cup, or a mixture.

I have 7 baristas on staff with zero to minimal coffee experience. I want them to be excited and eager to learn and come to work, but I’m finding it very difficult to do this with a machine that has images on their buttons that don’t even give a consistent shot each time. As more customers learn about our business and stop by, I’m getting worried they’ll try our coffee once and never come back.

What do we think? Is it more cost effective to replace the machine entirely? Should I convince the owners to let a repair tech come take a look-or would the tech probably say to upgrade anyways? Luckily, we are a smaller cafe, so we would only really need a single manual machine. Things are up in the air in terms of budgeting, so I’m trying to make a reasonable but practical decision.

First-time poster here :)

As the title says, I’m looking for ideas on what to crochet for my grandmother, who recently had a stroke. She’s a total badass and thankfully doing well! I haven’t seen her since it happened, but I’ll be visiting her soon—and with her birthday coming up, I’d love to make her something that’s both thoughtful *and* genuinely useful. I'm just kind of at a loss for what that could be.

A little context:  
I’m an intermediate-to-advanced crocheter. I don’t usually follow written patterns: I’m a visual learner with pretty severe ADD, so I work best with general ideas, video tutorials or photo guides.

As for my grandma:

* She’s an active, no-nonsense, European straight-shooter.
* Definitely *not* sentimental or into sappy stuff.
* Since the stroke, she can’t use her left side very well, but she’s still walking, doing light exercise, and cooking (though she struggles with things like chopping or opening jars).
* She loves going to the movies and drinking coffee.
* Before the stroke, she was very into fitness and staying busy.

I’d love any ideas for useful, practical crochet gifts that she might actually want to use—something that could help make her day-to-day life a little easier or more comfortable.

Thanks in advance!

**Description:** Long periods of time in the depths of the Camp Forge have left Edward looking more attune to a creature. He always seems to have some disheveled appearance whether its his hair or soot stains smeared across his face. The dark circles under his eyes are more telling than anything else. Lost in his work for days on end and muttering to himself. The son of the forge has been unapproachable since he appeared at the camp seven years ago. Growing into himself, he has broader frame like his father, and countless hours working in the forge has left him a chiseled frame. That would be the case if not for the fact that his lack of upkeep leaves him outwardly gaunt. If not for his siblings checking in on him, or forcing him out, Edward would be lost to the bowels of the forge for all time.

# History:

The loud clanking of massive machines and whistles of shift changes were a familiar sound to Edward. They echoed through his neighborhood muffling the sounds of the semi-trucks and trains in constant movement from the manufacturing facilities nearby. In a way they were his lullaby. His mother telling him stories of her day working in factory or ideas she had for work. The constant noise was the background music to her bedtime stories. Always fascinating and capturing the undivided attention of the wide-eyed boy who would soon drift to sleep. Dreaming of rivers of molten metal and the untold wonders of his mothers work filled with her experiments and inventions.

Eight years old, he was finally old enough to go to the Steel Mill with his mom. It wasn't so much a take your son to work day. As much as it was a promise that he would stop pestering her if she let him tag along. Fitted with a hard hat to big for head, a neon safety vest that fit like a trash bag and a earplugs, Edward toured the facility in reverence. The gigantic crucibles carrying literal tons of molten steel floating through the air. The heat that seemed to radiate off it was an impregnable fortress. Yet it did not deter the workers from shouting and working to meet their deadline. It was beyond dangerous. The pressure of the job and the work would make any one not fit for this grueling lifestyle to run screaming. For Edward, it was better than Christmas. This life was beautiful. It called to him like a fly to a flame.

His mother got caught up in work through out the day. Taking her eye of the curious Edward for just long enough for him to slip away. Panic and dread pierced her bones. The heat disappeared and was replaced with a chill that still haunts her to this day. Her screams drowned out by the heavy machinery. Searching for her baby boy in this labyrinth with death traps around every corner. It was the works yelling at Edward to get away that drew her back to him. Finally finding him, should have been a sigh of relief, instead it nearly shattered her world. Edward casually walking around, enamored by it all, was deaf the shouts and screams for him. The son of the forge at the mouth of the foundry's furnace. Flames licking out around him like tendrils trying to pull him in. Glowing in pure joy at the monstrous heat and monolith to human ingenuity. It was his mothers cold hand grabbing his neck, hoisting him up and running off away from the entrance of the Steel Mill's furnace that broke his trance. A blur of sirens and puzzled expressions followed Edward all the way to the hospital.

The next couple weeks were spent inside the hospital. His mother stuck in the Intensive Burn Unit. He was looked after by his neighbors. Going to school and then coming straight to the hospital after. It was near the day of Elizabeth's release that he saw his mom talking to old man in a wheelchair. A couple kids littered behind him. Edward didn't think much of it at the time. Thinking maybe it was just another patient in the hospital. However when he entered, all eyes shot to him. The tears in his Mom's eyes told him a different story.

---

# Now:

Edward walked out of the forge for the first time in two months. Not cause he wanted to, but because there was a need. The elusive camper couldn't shirk his responsibility anymore. He couldn't claim he was to young to get involved with the ever revolving door of catastrophe wreaking havoc on the world. It also didn't help that he had ran out of snacks. Edward grabbed the dirty rag off his toolbelt and wiped his face with it. Doing his best to clean the grease off his face but really only smearing it across his chin. He stood under the summer sun soaking into the heat and let out a small sigh. His stomach growling at him breaking the momentary peace he felt outside the forge. Grumbling to himself. Edward b-lined it to the dining pavilion. A quick trip for food before he sought out the job board to actually help the camp for once.",3,1751487496.0,CampHalfBloodRP,5,0.81,False

We would go to coffee shops together often, text weekly, go on double dates, vacations with my cousins 2-3 times a year, and I even asked her to be a bridesmaid in my wedding. Sara would come over to my house  3, sometimes even 4 times a week with her and my Brother's dog so that they could play in the yard together. My brother and Sara have an apartment and my Husband and I own a home, so they enjoyed letting their dog run around freely with my dog. Our dogs were also besties!

However, when I brought this up to my parents- they stated that didn't notice any changes in the way my brother and Sara interacted with us.

Fast forward to March. My Brother is very liberal and constantly sends political text message in our family group chat. I typically don't reply ad my Husband and I are more conservative and disagree with a lot of what he says. He sent some article about how Trump is equivalent to Hitler and I replied with ""I disagree, and I think Trump will do what's best for the Country"" That was ALL I said. He came at me with text messages bashing my intelligence, shitting on my career and stating that I shouldn't be allowed to be a school Principal if I support Trump. The conversation escalated, and I asked if our difference in politics is why Sara doesn't come over anymore, and he said yes. He went on to say how offensive it is that we support Trump, and that if we were really friends with Sarah, we wouldn't support someone who is hurting so many people like \*her\* (Sara's Mom was an illegal immigrant). He also went on to say that our Trump flag is disgusting and I should have my Husband take it down whenever Sara comes over out of respect for her. I ended up telling him to F off and he didn't reply.

He showed up to my parents house the next night, CRYING saying he's so hurt by my Husband and I. WHAT? We weren't the ones who acted differently towards him and Sara. Aside from displaying a flag at our house that WE pay the bills for, we have NEVER once brought up politics in front of Sara. He told my parents he can't believe he's related to someone who supports Trump and that Sara is incredibly hurt by us. What????? 

A few weeks go by an he texts me a BS apology, because my Husband and I were hosting Easter. He also said Sara was going to text me too. It was far from an apology. She started justifying why she's been so shitty to us. She also said her and my Brother have decided they're not going to have kids because it isn't fair that she has access to safe abortions in our state when other women in our country don't have that same right. What???  The conversation ended with her saying that she ""can't in good Faith  come to your home anymore"". I didn't reply. She didn't show up for Easter with him.

Now, at family events- they ignore my Husband and I. I've tried to talk to my parents and it seems like they don't want to get involved. They told us to just ""move on""... so continue to be ignored and be made to feel uncomfortable? Got it. I think cutting someone off due to political differences is insane and to be honest, something an immature, mentally ill, and unhinged person would do. I feel like my Husband and I  have been putting up with their bullshit for way too long, and I think if they ignore us again he might just lose it and flip the fuck out.
