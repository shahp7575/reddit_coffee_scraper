It’s called AttaPoll. Super quick surveys, takes like 2–3 minutes each, and they don’t disqualify you as often as the others. I’ve only been using it for a few days and already cashed out once. Not a full-time income obviously, but good for coffee money or whatever.

1lhmchc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1lhmchc/dreaming_in_the_same_places/,Dreaming in the same places,"This will be long, and might be completely normal and uninteresting but if you decide to read, thank you!! I keep dreaming that I’m going to be same places in my dreams. There are a few different places I can remember and which are in many many many of my dreams. Some places are somewhat recognizable to me as maybe some combination or a weird brain interpretation of places from my past, and sometimes they sort of morph together like I’ll turn around in my dreams and be in a different (but familiar) location.
So, one example is a bridge above a river except the bridge, if you could even call it that, is extremely high, very sketchy, and very far across, and usually my family is crossing and I’m very aware and nervous but it seems like the more I’ve had the dream, I swear I’ve gotten more comfortable on the bridge. 
Same as in some other places, like this run down old house where it’s somewhat like our old house, somewhat a random house I’ve never seen before but we keep somehow ending up buying it in my dreams because it’s all we can afford or something and all the floors are collapsing and I recognize it in the dream like “oh, here again?” 
Or the big fancy house with tons of rooms and secret staircases and a few floors and it’s like a fancy old hotel but it also looks like my grandparents’ old house, and there’s an in ground pool out back which in TONS of my dreams I am looking for and ready to swim in. People in the dream know I am always looking for this pool and roll their eyes as if to say “ohhh there she goes looking for the pool again” but I almost always end up jumping in, if it is clean. Sometimes in my dream it is really nasty like a stagnant puddle. Anyways, it starts out as a smaller sort of backyard in ground pool then sometimes it grows to Olympic size. And I can always breath underwater, and I always look up from the bottom of the pool and I can see light and people in the pool clearly and everything. 
There is another place which seems to be like a large airplane hangar or warehouse type of place they park large equipment and there are tools everywhere. It’s behind a grocery store type of place which is in a town that kind of looks like my hometown but also looks like the steep hills in San Francisco and it’s different but I’m looking for places (like my favorite coffee shop) I used to go to when I lived in my hometown (which also had a river)..
..speaking of rivers again I have a dream where we’re (me and family) floating down the river but it’s way different and it’s dangerous. The river where I’m from has slow parts and whitewater rapids but I’m talking dangerous like going off little cliffs and through underground tunnels and there’s logs and stuff in the water. More water? Oh okay! I’m always looks for shells alone the shorelines of whatever water I’m near in my dreams. Whoever is there in my dream at the time, often my mom, knows I am looking for shells and does the eye rolling thing. Sometimes we’re on a road trip and I see a beach and I tell them I HAVE to stop and look for shells!! It can be any body of water not just the ocean. Though the body of water sometimes transforms like the land does throughout my dreams. 
The land transforms a lot when I dream about running through the woods in the mountains. Pretty unrealistic wave-like hills. And usually I end up in one of the places mentioned above, whether it’s a beach (sometimes a terrible dirty beach, sometimes a crazy surrealistic beach where I can see through the water like it’s a glass floor and see so many kinds of sea life including an orca whale) or a stream that turns into the river that we cross on the very high up bridge, the town that looks like mine but not quite, etc etc.
One last dream I have a lot is that we are far away and have a big drive to make but it’s late in the day and I’m so so worried about driving through the night while I’m tired. Sometimes while I’m driving I will be in a city with tons of exits, overpasses, stuff like that (think Dallas, San Fran, Denver, etc) and be so lost and confused and sometimes on my way to an airport where I miss my flight. A couple times I’ve actually been inside an airport but that’s a newer one I haven’t really had a lot. 
There are other things that reoccur in my dreams but they’re events vs locations. If you made it this far, holy cow, thanks! Sorry if it was hard to follow, I’m just a rambling girl. Would love to hear some thoughts on any of this!! ❤️ ",1,1750594078.0,DreamInterpretation,1,1.0,False

It's a complete necessity for my ADHD-I brain, to the point I'm the classic case of ""needing it"" to function. 

I'm trying to produce better spending habits, and bringing my own coffee to work etc is something I ""check off"" in my habits app to game-ify things (it also helps with looking back at things I've done or need to improve upon, with my memory being less than ideal).

So, what's worked for you? Anything you do or prepare at home to make your own as desirable as possible for being on the move?

1lhm94n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToBeHero_X/comments/1lhm94n/uhhh_so_lin_ling_might_be_x/,Uhhh so Lin Ling might be X,"I was not a fan of this theory at first, but the X being from the future thing makes more sense than ever now. Let's break down their similarities.

•They both exist outside the manipulation of the hero commission- Lin Ling did this bt breaking the Nice persona, even though he might still be under Treeman for now, I can see him escaping soon, especially since he has directly dealt with Spotlight who Mr. Shand seems involved with. A bonus on this too, is Lin Ling was able to challenge God-Eye's entire ideology, proving that the system can be broken.

•Time abilities- Lin Ling seems to have some kind of future sight, as he saw Moon's death before it happened. X being from the future means he must have time travel capabilities on top of everything else.

•Powers in general- Lin Ling's powers are basically surprise attacks randomly, they're chaotic punches, but he can also see the future? Seems like his powers could evolve to have similarities to X as his trust value grows. 

•Appearance- That strand of white hair you see on Lin Ling? That's not some of Nice's essence left in him, that's his hair turning white as his power grows, and X has white hair too. Also, look at X's civilian appearance, could Lin Ling not look like that in 5 years with a haircut and professional appearance? They even share a white and black color scheme.

•Thematic relevance- Both seem to ideologically compliment each other, yeah we don't know X's true goal, but we do have an idea from the opening and ending songs, especially the ending lyrics. They both seem to represent breaking the flawed system put in place. Being a hero isn't about a number on your wrist, it's using your power to do what's right. Great power comes great responsibility.

•Villains- Not much to go on here beside they have both fought Nice's nemesis Wreck. How DOS gained this info that X fought him is beyond me, but it's interesting that they even fight at all, as all the fights we know about from X outside of this is from the tournament, amd interesting enough when Lin Ling(as Nice) fights Wreck, that is when we hear X snap. But X has a connection to Rock to, albeit a poor one, maybe Rock put the hit out on Moon and X finds out and confronts him about it. 

•Jobs- although John salaryman and hero marketing agent aren't the same, working for DOS(shown in the pv for X on his coffee mug) seems like an evolution from his previous job. Now here's where things get interesting. Lin Ling markets heroes, he makes signs and promotions for them. To Be Hero X is his final marketing campaign before he is fired, right before Nice's death, and it is seen again right as Lin Ling becomes his own hero, the Commoner.

•The Commoner. This hero persona kinda embodies X. He is just some dude who walked in, no one knows who the hell he is in the tournament, yet he confidently bodies everyone with no effort. No one knew who Lin Ling was as he walked out of the Hero Tower, everyone was confused, yet this random dude made it to the top 10 by breaking the very rules set in place. X is such a foil to queen because instead of trying to be X to change the system with order and entering tournaments, he becomes X naturally through being a hero. No big ambitious goals or announcements, the man just wants to do good. Giving the goons more of a fight than the top 10 heroes could just be to flex, or to teach them all a valuable lesson. Fuck these corporations, they shouldn't control who you are. The whole tournament is rigged, Queen herself is set up with Lucky Cyan as a cheat code for becoming X, even if she didn't want that. X is beyond all of this, and Lin Ling has proven the only one so far capable of evolving into being this idealized version of himself. Another thing, Lin Ling's marketing is straight up foreshadowing in another way, as the marketer becomes the one being marketed everywhere. Also why did the To Be Hero X ad play so convienently? There just seems to be too many similarities and Lin Ling is still 1st place, the most likeable character, and his new look implies a +100 charisma boost. X and Commoner are also the only ones in the top 10 with a secret identity, and X's civilian persona as a normal business is very much like Lin Ling's hero persona by definition, a commoner.

Hand tremors
Arms, legs, hands going numb or tingly
Widespread pain through my whole body with no physical trauma

We lived together, were close to each other’s families, and built a life that, from the outside, looked stable and solid. But something inside me had been eroding for a long time  and I didn’t have the courage to fully face it or talk about it. I’ve spent the last three years living abroad (Italy), and it was the hardest period of my life mentally. I struggled with depression, intense anxiety about failure, and the fear that if I lost my job, I’d lose everything  my place here, and the relationship. I felt trapped, yet I said nothing. I never told my partner how bad it truly was  not even that I had suicidal thoughts. I convinced myself I was protecting her by staying silent. That emotional distance slowly built a wall between us. Our relationship became stagnant  emotionally and physically. We tried to talk about the lack of intimacy and connection, but nothing changed. She’s a good person, caring, helpful  her family even supported me when I moved abroad. But I started feeling suffocated. Like I was playing a role I no longer recognized myself in. Then, during a recent trip to my home country, I met someone. It was random  we were part of the same tour group. I was there with my family, and we just started talking. I asked her to get a coffee later, not expecting much, and to my surprise, she said yes. I told her upfront I was in a relationship. But we talked for hours. And we clicked  humor, music, values, outlook on life. We kept in touch through Instagram after she returned to her country. She later told me she didn’t feel right continuing while I was still in a relationship  so we paused. But I reached out again. And talking to her felt... effortless. I didn’t physically cheat, but emotionally, I know I crossed a line. She became a mirror. A reminder of how disconnected and numb I’d become. Eventually, I ended things with my girlfriend  and from her perspective, it was sudden. I told her I wasn’t happy and didn’t see a future. She was devastated. Shocked. She said she never saw it coming  that I never truly opened up. That I made her feel like she didn’t know who I really was. That I shattered her ability to trust. And maybe she’s right. Now I’m sitting with guilt, shame, and a lot of confusion. I told the new girl that I needed space to figure myself out, and we’ve stopped talking again. The truth is: I didn’t give either of these women  or myself  the honesty we all deserved. I avoided hard conversations. I tried to spare pain, but ended up causing more of it. I thought I was being “nice”  but in the end, I just avoided being real. I’m going back to my hometown now to reset. To face myself. I know I need therapy. I need to work on emotional maturity, on honest communication, and on not hiding behind silence.

I don’t know how to feel. Did I make the right decision? Was it just avoidance in disguise? Can someone still be decent even after hurting others this deeply?

1lhm2d4,https://i.redd.it/l0nvz2e3wg8f1.jpeg,Fraganote Drunken Cake- Review! 🍰☕️,"First Impressions✨
Okay, this one is literally drunk in the beginning, like imagine someone spilled dark rum on a tray of dark chocolate and almonds. Super boozy, super rich, but, I didn’t love the opening. The rum and dark chocolate hit HARD for the first 20 minutes, and even though almond isn’t listed, my nose definitely picks it up loud and clear.

📝 Notes Breakdown:

* Top Notes: Tiramisu, Chocolate, Dark Rum

* Middle Notes: Cold Coffee, Irish Cream Liqueur, Caramel

* Base Notes: Vanilla.

After around 30 minutes, it finally settles down. The tiramisu comes forward with this creamy coffee vibe, with soft caramel and chocolate in the background. Vanilla in the base, making it much smoother and sweeter. From here, it stays pretty linear for the next few hours.


⏱ Performance:


* First 3-4 hours: moderate projection.

* After that it becomes skin scent that lasts for maybe extra 2 hours.

* Longevity isn’t the best tbh. For 1300 for 50ml, I expected stronger staying power, but maybe it needs a bit of time to macerate and settle. Let’s see!

🌸 Season:
Definitely a cooler weather scent. Fall, winter, maybe even chilly spring nights. 

♑ Zodiac Vibe:
Capricorn energy for sure! Classy but lowkey intense. Although as always, wear whatever you want, this is just for fun 😄.


🎬 Character Aesthetic:
I can imagine Morticia Addams for the opening of this scent but then I also get  Blair Waldorf as it settles down. The heavy boozy chocolate opening is very morticia Adam’s vibe. And the creamy tiramisu dry down is the luxurious comfort that Blair expects in her world. 


🎭 Vibe Check & Setting:

Picture this:
U r getting ready for a fancy dessert date night at a fancy restaurant. Dim lights, soft music playing, wearing a velvet gown, gold hoops, with a dark vampy lipstick. You walk in, and the air smells like coffee, dark chocolate, and caramelized sugar. It’s cozy, seductive, but a little too heavy handed when it first arrives for the date. 😅


Would I repurchase it?

No ❌. It’s nice and def different from what other Indian perfume houses have to offer these days, but, for the lack of performance and the price, WNRP!

TL;DR:


* Opening: boozy, dark rum, bitter chocolate, almond vibes.

* Drydown: creamy tiramisu, coffee, caramel, vanilla.

* Performance: meh (3-4 hrs good, then skin scent).

* Not for summer.

* Capricorn energy.

* Great if you want a tiramisu perfume, not quite what I wanted for a straight up chocolate scent.

* It’s good, but WNRP!

I m still on the hunt for my ultimate chocolate perfume. I have Choco Musk, which is nice but leans more towards vanilla biscuit than chocolate dessert.Saw people compare Khadlaj Choco Brown to Nutella. Super curious to try that one next! 👀

And when did Starbucks become fast food? I understand 4/4/12, but dear Lord...when did starbucks trade work for souls?

I try to stay optimistic and value kindness in people. I'm kind of a curious person and like learning about how different things work among other topics particularly biology and am joining med school this year. 
As for my hobbies, I like reading(especially thrillers), watching Kdramas and other TV shows, youtube, listening to podcasts(informative, true crime and fun ones too) and music (pop, R&B, bands like arctic monkeys, chase atlantic and cigs after s). I enjoy going on walks and workout pretty regularly. I have also been exploring painting lately(I have always wanted to try but was a bit busy with exam preparation and all).

The first, next to the living nodule, was a kitchen garden of vegetables grown with aquaponics. ""You said you cooked on the freighter, I hope it was more than throwing a meal bag in a pot of boiling water.""

""The freighter captain was too cheap for that, everything was made from scratch.""

""Good, because much of what we eat comes from this nodule."" I showed them some marks on a table near the fish tank. ""Any fish smaller than this is put back to grow, and any longer than this other mark will be put back to breed. All animal waste is freeze dried then powdered to become soil amendments except egg shells, they are ground up to be added to the chicken feed. Any plant waste is given to the rabbits and chickens.""

""You have rabbits and chickens?""

""Yes, but don't get attached to any of them, they are food.""

The next nodule was for livestock. Rabbit hutches on the left and chickens were on the right. I explained about the worm beds under the rabbit hutches, and when the worms became too numerous, some were fed to the chickens and fish. Automatic feeders fed alfalfa pellets to the rabbits and mixed grains to the chickens. ""The chickens are also my soil factory. The floor under the pens are sloped. Rock dust and plant waste are added to the upper end. The chicken scratching moves the soil down the slope and aids in the plant decomposition. The finished soil and chicken manure is removed from the lower end."" Part of their job will be to feed the plant waste and remove the worm castings from under the rabbits.

The next two were what I called the farm nodules. Each had six grow sections. Each section was rotated between a legume, a grain, and what I call produce. The first was growing alfalfa, peanuts, sunflowers, popcorn, garlic, and watermelons. The second had buckwheat, black beans, dent corn, soft wheat, tomatoes, and jalapenos.

The next was a produce processing nodule. It had freezers, grain threshers, grain mills, freeze dryers, dehydrators, and canning equipment. It also had direct access to the central docking nodule.

The fruit nodule had grape vines, dwarf blueberries, strawberries and such.

The tropical nodule had dwarf banana trees, sugar cane, and other vines and bushes. I hope to get some vanilla and black pepper vines after the coffee and cacao are established.

The last nodule was the restricted one. ""Access to this one only by myself and the head medical officer of Beta station. This is were I grow things like curare, hemlock, caster beans, and the like. There are three stills here, one for alcohol, one for distilled water, and a spare if I need extra of either or one is down. All tinctures are made and usually stored here.""

""That leads us back around to the living nodule. Now I know you have some questions. I'll answer a couple then you need to gather all the eggs and bring them to the kitchen. Next go to the garden nodule and pick something for dinner. It is 2:17 pm GMT and I usually have dinner around 6:00. Now your first question.""

""You have a lot of plants growing compared to you, a few rabbits, and a few chickens. Where does all the CO2 come from?""

""Not long after I got this habitat and moved it here to my claim, I made a trip out to the Jovian system. I brought back a large piece of frozen methane and a couple of pieces of ice. The cook stoves, stills, and heaters in each nodule are set to clean burn the methane to produce CO2 and water vapor. The vents to the stove and oven are piped to the garden nodule. Next question.""

""What is in that locked cabinet in the kitchen?""

""That is where I keep imports and hard to get items such as coffee and salt.""

""Why do you keep it locked if you are the only one here?""

""First, I am not always alone. The security people and the station medical staff have standing invitations to visit when I'm here. Sometimes Belters traveling through will stop and visit. And in the case of a true emergency, someone could seek sanctuary here. Second it helps me not to be wasteful. I use very little salt except when I eat popcorn. I limit myself to one pot of coffee and one batch of popcorn a week. If you have any more questions, you can ask them later.

I wish I could forget the worst supplement I ever bought.

It was a midnight impulse, twenty reviews deep, and the label looked like a NASA project.

No clue what half of it meant.

A week later, I was chasing my heart rate, wondering if this was the day I’d explain to a doctor why my pee turned neon green.

I learned the hard way, burning cash, wrecking my sleep and embarrassing myself on more than one bathroom run.

So here’s every lesson I wish someone shoved in my face before my first mistake.

# Top 5 rules for not ruining your health or wallet

* If a product brags about miracles, it’s lying.
* Only buy supplements with legit third party testing on the label. If you don’t see it, walk away, trust me, I learned the expensive way.
* Always google every single ingredient with side effects and reddit before buying. I once skipped this and ended up with a headache that lasted two days.
* Proprietary blends with no amounts listed mean someone’s hiding something. Learned this after a stim blend nuked my appetite and my mood for a week.
* Ask yourself, do I actually need this or am I just bored and falling for the hype? That question would have saved me hundreds.

I wish I could say I was smart enough to learn this up front.

# How I research any supplement (and why you should too)

I got burned trusting science backed blends that had zero real science.

Look up each ingredient on examine, pubmed, or honestly just google and reddit.

Check for human studies.

Animal tests mean nothing for you.

Compare the dosages in the product to the studies.

What’s on the label is usually less, or sometimes way more, than what actually works.

Double check for banned or gray market ingredients, like dmaa or sketchy nootropics.

One time, I had to google a label ingredient on the bathroom floor, don’t be me.

Dig up real user experiences.

Reddit is a goldmine if you skip the shills.

Someone out there already made your exact mistake and is probably warning you in the comments.

# Three ways supplement brands try to fool you

* Insane claims like gain twenty pounds of muscle in a month. Biggest lie in the industry. If you see it, run.
* Hidden blends. Proprietary just means you have no clue what’s inside. I once bought a fat burner that was ninety percent caffeine and filler.
* Unpronounceable or shady sounding ingredients. Pause and look them up. Carrageenan gave me stomach pain for days, buried at the bottom of the label.

Influencer reviews are mostly paid.

Real users in forums or comments tell you what actually happens after a week, like the time I learned the hard way that yohimbine is not a joke.

# How to not overdose, crash, or waste your money

This one hits home.

* More is rarely better.
* One scoop, not two, no matter what the gym bro says. I once doubled up and spent the night pacing my apartment with the shakes.
* Cycle anything strong, like hardcore stims or test boosters. I ignored this, crashed hard, and felt like trash for days.
* Don’t stack a ton of new stuff at once. Add one, see how your body reacts, then maybe add another. Trust me, mixing three new things is just asking for a bathroom emergency.

Sometimes you’ll wonder if it’s working.

If you feel off, stop.

No PR or beast mode is worth feeling like death.

I once emailed support at 2am convinced I was dying, turns out, just too much yohimbine and a bad Youtube recommendation.

# Real research vs. internet hype (and why I stopped believing stories)

Human studies only.

Mice aren’t bench pressing.

Check if the study actually used the same dose as your supplement.

Most don’t.

Who funded the research?

If it’s the company, take it with a mountain of salt.

Anecdotes are fun, but don’t trust anyone posting a before and after that looks like a marvel origin story.

Ask yourself, if it was that easy, wouldn’t everyone look like a bodybuilder?

# What nobody tells you about supplements

You will regret something eventually.

Side effects are real, even with all natural stuff.

I lost two nights of sleep to an herbal relaxer that did the opposite of what it promised.

Supplements are not pre approved.

Brands can say almost anything until they get caught.

If you get a weird reaction, stop, immediately.

I tried to power through once and ended up googling kidney pain after fat burner.

If you’re on medication, double check everything.

Your doctor has seen more dumb supplement mistakes than reddit ever will.

# FAQ, The questions nobody wants to ask out loud

* Can I mix these two together or will I explode? Sometimes, it really does feel like Russian roulette.
* What happens if I miss a dose? Spoiler, probably nothing except maybe peace of mind.
* Is pre workout really that much better than just drinking coffee? Sometimes yes, sometimes you’re just paying for flavored caffeine.
* Should I cycle creatine, or is that a bro myth? Most people don’t and they’re fine.
* Is this safe for months or just for a short boost? Nobody tells you the long term risks, so be careful.

# Final checklist before you buy or pop anything

* Is there third party testing or just trust me marketing?
* Can you find real reviews from people not selling the product?
* Are all ingredients and dosages listed?
* If you can’t find it, assume the worst.
* Do you honestly need this, or are you just falling for the hype like I used to?
* You don’t need a fat burner if you’re already wired on coffee. Ask me how I know.

# For more, check the community wiki or drop your question below.

I’ll keep this guide updated as new research or new scams pop up.

Ask anything, no shame, no stupid questions.

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Before sending me a message, please read the following information below as to what I am, and I am not, looking for in a potential new friend, and friendship.


***WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR:



-  People who actually want to make new friends, and are serious and genuinely interested in developing a long-term  friendship (this sounds obvious, but I’m not fully convinced that some people on this app are looking for the exact same thing as me). 



-  People who are looking to develop platonic friendships only (I’m not interested in NSFW or people messaging me with non-platonic/romantic/sexual intentions, and so people who are looking for this should look elsewhere for other people who are looking for the same on other apps, like dating apps). 



- People who share common social interests/hobbies, and shared values with me (see above). 



-  People who actually want to meet up, regularly where possible, in person and IRL, and socialise and do social activities together in person. 



-  People who are in the same country as me (i.e Britain), and preferably nearby regions (e.g London, East Midlands, West Midlands etc). 






****WHAT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR, AND WHICH ARE RED FLAGS FOR ME: 



-  People who want online friendships only (I am really not interested in online-only friendships, as I’m looking to meet people who actually want to meet up in person in real life, and are physically able to do so, without any time zone distances). 


- People who don’t actually want to build friendships, but are only on this app because they are bored or lonely in the moment, and want to someone to chat with to pass the time (I am really not interested in these type of people, and I ask you to please not message me if that is what your intentions are, as I will not respond). 


-  People who give one-word responses or one-line responses, and make little or no effort, or a lack of effort, to have an actual detailed and engaging conversation. If this is you, I ask you to not message me. I firmly believe that friendship is a two-way street, and I am fully invested in getting to know someone as a person, and likewise, I would expect the other person is willing to reciprocate the same level of effort I put in, and show real interest and engagement with me as a person. 


-  People who want to mess with people  and play with their emotions by having one conversation with them, or short-term chats and conversations, and then subsequently ghosting or blocking them (whether on this app or elsewhere on other social media). If this is you, please don’t message me, as I will not respond. Ghosting is extremely cruel, hurtful and disrespectful to do on people, and nobody deserves to be treated this way. 


- People who lead other people on and make them believe they want a genuine friendship with them, and want to meet up with them, only for them to turn out to be fake, and drop that new potential friend, and disappear without explanation (see the issue of ghosting above). If this is you, please don’t message me, as I will not respond. I am very serious about making new friends, and I don’t appreciate people stringing me along and faking interest in me, and then ultimately blocking or ghosting me. I want people who are genuinely interested in getting to know me, and are willing to put actual time and effort into developing a platonic friendship with me. 


- People who lie, and are deceitful and dishonest about themselves, and their life. To be blunt, I hate liars, and they are not welcome in my life. I want to have friends who are honest and have integrity, and so having trust and respect for each other in a friendship is essential. If you are a person who habitually lies and strings people along, then I ask you to please stay away from me, and not message me. I have been hurt very badly by people in the past who I previously considered friends, but who eventually turned out to be the opposite, by lying to me. Just to be clear, if you get to know me and become friends with me, and then I subsequently catch you trying to lie to or deceive me in any way (it doesn’t matter if that is during our first conversation, or a few months down the line, or a year later etc), any friendship you have with me will be immediately over. I will never give a second chance to someone who lies to me. 


- People who live in other international countries. Whilst I am happy to have international friends, I am specifically looking to make new friends who live in the same country as me, as this will give more opportunities to meet up in person and do social activities together IRL. Having friends to meet up in person regularly is something I’m really lacking in my life right now, and so having friends to meet IRL is key for me when looking for new friends now. For me, it doesn’t matter if the people I meet are not nationals of the country (as in not born in or from the country) I am based in, however, it is essential that they are living on a permanent and long-term basis in the same country as where I am.

But she was one of the few people that treated Jesse with respect. Yeah, she offered him coffee and that’s about it. But she could have gone off about him being in her home, and she didn’t. For her the big picture was getting Walt, as well as supporting Hank.

It’s curious we never saw her ask about Jesse when Hank was missing. 

I wonder if she would have judged Jesse harshly or blamed Walt’s influence , thus being a little sympathetic to him. After all she saw first hand how manipulative and deceptive Walt was.

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Before sending me a message, please read the following information below as to what I am, and I am not, looking for in a potential new friend, and friendship.


***WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR:



-  People who actually want to make new friends, and are serious and genuinely interested in developing a long-term  friendship (this sounds obvious, but I’m not fully convinced that some people on this app are looking for the exact same thing as me). 



-  People who are looking to develop platonic friendships only (I’m not interested in NSFW or people messaging me with non-platonic/romantic/sexual intentions, and so people who are looking for this should look elsewhere for other people who are looking for the same on other apps, like dating apps). 



- People who share common social interests/hobbies, and shared values with me (see above). 



-  People who actually want to meet up, regularly where possible, in person and IRL, and socialise and do social activities together in person. 



-  People who are in the same country as me (i.e Britain), and preferably nearby regions (e.g London, East Midlands, West Midlands etc). 






****WHAT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR, AND WHICH ARE RED FLAGS FOR ME: 



-  People who want online friendships only (I am really not interested in online-only friendships, as I’m looking to meet people who actually want to meet up in person in real life, and are physically able to do so, without any time zone distances). 


- People who don’t actually want to build friendships, but are only on this app because they are bored or lonely in the moment, and want to someone to chat with to pass the time (I am really not interested in these type of people, and I ask you to please not message me if that is what your intentions are, as I will not respond).

# 5/27/2022 -How Does Niocorp's Elk Creek Project compare to other ""World Class Projects?""

**\*\*\*RESPONSE**

""It is a bit tricky to compare rare earth projects on an apples-to-apples basis, which is why we chose to limit the comparison of our Elk Creek resource to other REE projects in the U.S. There are several reasons why. For one, there are several different legal systems that determine how a project can measure and disclose aspects of its mineral resource and/or reserve.

For public companies that are SEC-reporting entities (such as NioCorp), the SK1300 standard must be followed. For public companies regulated by Canadian authorities (also such as NioCorp), there is the National Instrument 43-101 disclosure standard.

In Australia, there is the JORC standard. Each of these systems differ in what they allow, or don't allow, in terms of public disclosure of mineral resources and reserves. This can lead to 'apples-to-oranges' comparisons among projects. Another challenge in making such comparisons is the mineralization of an REE project. Some projects can show a high ore grade of rare earths, but the mineralization of the ore is something that is very difficult to process. For example, rare earth projects based on silicate-based minerals -- such as eudialyte -- are extraordinarily difficult to economically process in order to pull the REEs out and separate them. Others can contain relatively high levels of other impurities, such as naturally occurring radioactive elements, that can increase the cost of processing. A high ore grade doesn't mean a lot if the REE mineralization isn't amenable to processing that is technically or economically infeasible.

This is why only a small handful of the more than 200 REE-containing minerals have ever been successfully processed economically at commercial scale. ***(The two primary REE-containing minerals in the Elk Creek Project, bastnasite and monazite***, ***are among those that have been successfully processed for decades)***.

Rare earth resources also differ in terms of the relative distribution of individual REEs in the host mineral. Some may have a relatively high ore grade but also have high percentages of less valuable REEs, such as cerium or lanthanum or yttrium. Others have lower ore grades but their REE mineralization is skewed more favorably to higher-value REEs, such as the magnetics neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium which are used in NdFeB magnets.

There are several other REEs that are also magnetic, such as samarium, but those are of lower value. Another way that REE projects are compared to one another is through a so-called “basket price.” This is a particularly misleading way of valuing a rare earth play, in my opinion, because a project’s ‘basket price’ assigns a dollar value to the individual REEs in the ore, multiplying total tonnes of each REE by current market price for that REE, and combines them all together. This assumes that a project will produce each and every one of the REEs in the ‘basket’ (which is almost never the case). It also ignores the enormous CAPEX and OPEX required to produce 14 or so individual REEs.

**There are yet other factors that help determine the viability of a potential rare earth project. \~Some projects are aimed at only producing rare earths. That means that they are relatively riskier investments than projects that are designed to produce multiple products in addition to rare earths.**

***A)\~Some projects that are relatively large in size, have high ore grades, and are comprised of processable minerals -- but they are located in places that make mining and processing difficult or very expensive. I can think of a few projects that are touted as attractive deposits but are located near or above the Arctic Circle, which generally makes mining more costly.***

***B)\~ Others are located in places where there local residents, such as First Nations communities in Canada or anywhere in Greenland, can readily block a project from moving to commercial operation. Still others are in countries where local governments are less stable than in the U.S., or are simply prone to corruption, which exposes the project to high country risk.***

***C)\~Many REE projects are proposed by teams that have no experience in commercially processing REEs. They tend to gloss over that fact. Knowing what I know about the challenges of producing separated, high-purity REEs, this is one of the most important factors I consider when I look at REE projects. But that is just my opinion.***

A more useful comparison strategy for investors is to look at rare earth projects through multiple lenses, such as those I describe above. It is not easy to do this if one doesn’t have a pretty deep understanding of the REE industry and the challenges of successfully making these strategic metals.

# Having said all of that, it’s clear that our Elk Creek carbonatite is very large and similar in total contained rare earths to some of the largest known rare earth resources in the world, including the Araxa carbonatite in Brazil and the St. Honore carbonatite in Quebec.""

1lhlvib,https://i.redd.it/7kl25r5vkg8f1.png,"$ATYR – Kennedy’s Post on X, the New FDA Voucher, and What Yesterday’s Announcement Means for Biotech Investors","Hey folks,

Four days ago I took a deep dive into the FDA’s new Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher (CNPV) program—what it means, why it’s not just another “fast track,” and how it could transform the timelines and risk/reward for aTyr Pharma (ATYR) and its lead asset, Efzofitimod. If you haven’t read that post, I’d suggest starting there for the full regulatory backdrop.

Since then, the momentum around U.S. biotech policy hasn’t slowed down—in fact, it’s just picked up speed. Yesterday, Secretary Kennedy went public with a statement laying out the administration’s priorities for American biotech. The messaging was unambiguous: U.S. life sciences are being positioned as a national strategic asset. Kennedy’s post makes it clear that the mission is to “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA), with a sharp focus on accelerating U.S.-led biotech innovation (MABA), cutting red tape, and shifting the edge away from large incumbents and foreign suppliers. The intention is to transform breakthroughs into real-world cures faster, at lower cost, and with American science at the core.

Just to be clear, I understand that politics can be polarising—and even Kennedy himself is a polarising figure for many. But this isn’t a post about personalities or political partisanship. This is a post about the direct, real-world impact of policy announcements on biotech investment, capital flows, and, in particular, what it could mean for aTyr Pharma (ATYR) and sector sentiment more broadly.

Whether or not these ambitions all materialise, announcements like this do two things: they shape sentiment and reframe what institutional and retail investors are watching. Even before a single rule is changed, capital starts to reposition, analysts refresh their frameworks, and the market begins to handicap which companies are best aligned for the new regime. For ATYR, and for the entire sector, this kind of policy signalling is anything but trivial.

Ok, let’s get into it.

### 1. Executive Summary / Key Institutional Takeaways

- The Kennedy doctrine now sets up a clear two-tier regime in U.S. biotech: “policy darlings” (innovative, U.S.-based, high-need focus) and “incumbent villains” (large, legacy pharma with pricing exposure).
- The FDA’s new Commissioner's National Priority Voucher (CNPV) isn’t just a procedural update—it is a structural shift in how time-to-market, risk, and value are modelled, especially for companies like aTyr Pharma (ATYR).
- Policy sentiment is real: announcements like these have the power to re-rate entire segments (e.g., XBI), drive new options flows, and attract both retail and event-driven institutional capital—sometimes well ahead of implementation.
- aTyr is firmly in the “policy darling” camp—rare disease, U.S. manufacturing, innovative pipeline, and late-stage catalyst. The market, in my read, still underestimates how much policy can serve as a non-linear accelerator for setups like this.
- The risk/reward math for ATYR now needs to factor in this new “voucher option.” Even if not all policy details materialise, the shift in narrative and capital flows is already underway.

### 2. Decoding the Doctrine: MAHA/MABA—Who Wins, Who Loses?

The core of Kennedy’s new health and biotech policy is the creation of a two-tiered system—one that clearly differentiates between the sector’s “legacy” giants and a new class of U.S.-centric, innovation-driven biotechs. It’s not just a rhetorical flourish; it’s a real attempt to shift incentives, capital, and political goodwill toward the latter, and to apply more regulatory and pricing pressure on the former.

**MAHA—“Make America Healthy Again”** is fundamentally about driving greater accountability and cost control among established pharmaceutical incumbents. That means more attention to pricing practices, less tolerance for “me-too” drug launches, and an explicit focus on what Kennedy has described as “overmedicalization”—the proliferation of drugs and procedures with marginal benefit, often at the expense of patients and payers. The “villain” in this part of the doctrine is the entrenched, multinational drug company, typically with a sprawling product portfolio and heavy lobbying presence.

**MABA—“Make American Biotech Accelerate”** is the counterweight: a policy lever meant to reward genuine innovation that addresses high-priority health needs, with preference given to companies that are both domestically anchored and focused on therapies where unmet need remains high. It’s about turning American science and manufacturing capacity into a national asset. The “hero” here is the clinical-stage or pre-commercial biotech working on first-in-class drugs for rare diseases, serious chronic conditions, or areas of clear public health demand.

In my read, what’s different about this approach is how overt the bifurcation is—there’s no real attempt to hide who is meant to win and who is meant to lose. And the capital markets, in my experience, move very quickly to reflect these signals, even when the actual policy implementation lags behind the rhetoric.

**Who benefits? Who faces new risks? Here’s how I see it:**

| **Category**                       | **Winners (“Policy Darlings”)**                                        | **Losers (“Incumbent/Legacy”)**                          |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Company Focus                       | U.S.-based, innovation-led, rare/serious disease focus                | Large, multinational, legacy franchises                  |
| Regulatory Pathway                  | Access to CNPV, Fast Track, Orphan, rolling review, policy advocacy   | Standard review, longer timelines, increased red tape    |
| Political Narrative                 | Framed as drivers of U.S. innovation, public good                     | Framed as cost centers, targets for reform               |
| Capital Flow                        | Eligible for new mandates, more event-driven and institutional flows  | Outflows from ESG, risk-averse and index funds           |
| Pricing/Access Risk                 | Favorable, at least in the near/medium term                           | High—potential for price controls, negative headlines    |
| Example: aTyr Pharma (ATYR)         | ✔ Fits policy darling archetype—innovative, rare disease, US-based    | ✗ Not exposed (not a legacy, not multinational)          |

**Where does aTyr fit?**  
On virtually every axis of this table, ATYR aligns with the “policy darling” profile:  
- Innovative clinical science, with a mechanism validated in rare and serious disease  
- U.S. manufacturing and a domestic corporate structure  
- Positioned for CNPV eligibility, with prior Orphan and Fast Track designations  
- Not exposed to legacy “Big Pharma” pricing risk, nor to negative MAHA scrutiny

What I find important is that these distinctions aren’t just political window-dressing. They’re now part of how fund managers, strategists, and allocators are parsing risk, opportunity, and regulatory optionality. In my experience, capital flows follow the scent of regulatory favor—and once it’s this explicit, the process can accelerate, sometimes even ahead of clinical readouts or actual voucher awards.

**So what?**  
For investors, reading the doctrine correctly isn’t just about picking the right science. It’s about understanding which business models have now been put on the right (or wrong) side of the next capital cycle. If the administration’s policy holds, it could mean a multi-year tailwind for names like ATYR—while large, diversified incumbents face persistent, politically-driven headwinds.

### 3. Policy News & Sentiment: How Markets React

When policy messaging comes from the top, the effects on market sentiment can be swift and wide-ranging—well before anything is signed into law. Over years of watching the sector, I’ve seen that the market often moves first, and waits for the regulatory follow-through later.

**Macro Sentiment: Sector, ETF, and XBI Moves**

Large-scale announcements around biotech policy—especially those that alter the risk/reward for large groups of companies—tend to spark sector-wide positioning. History is full of examples where an FDA, HHS, or presidential announcement has led to major inflows (or outflows) in biotech ETFs like XBI, IBB, or SMID-cap trackers. These moves aren’t always permanent, but they can set the tone for weeks or even months.

Some reference points:
- The passage of the Orphan Drug Act in the 1980s, which kicked off multi-year outperformance for rare disease-focused biotechs.
- Operation Warp Speed in 2020, where government support and policy clarity led to immediate and sustained moves in vaccine and therapy names.
- Announcements around drug price controls or PBM reform, which have sparked short-term sell-offs in large caps, but sometimes unleashed rotation into small/mid cap innovators.

**Sentiment Impact Matrix (Selected Historical Analogs):**

| Policy Actor / Event                  | Headline / Announcement                            | XBI / ETF Move         | Follow-through / Reversal        |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| FDA / HHS: Orphan Drug Act (1983)     | Incentives for rare disease drug development       | Multi-year outperformance | Lasting                       |
| FDA: Priority Review Voucher (2007)   | Incentives for pediatric/rare disease approvals    | Short bursts in names  | Event-driven                    |
| Obama/Trump Drug Pricing Initiatives  | Medicare price negotiation/discount proposals      | -3–6% in XBI           | Often reversed / sector rotation |
| Operation Warp Speed (2020, COVID)    | Funding and fast-track for vaccines/therapies      | +10–15% weeks          | Months, then normalised          |
| HHS: Kennedy MAHA/MABA (2025)         | Two-tier regime, CNPV priority                     | Rotation into SMID/innovators | TBD, narrative-driven   |

What these analogs show, in my view, is that capital follows clarity—and when there’s a signal about which types of companies will be favored, sector rotation happens quickly, sometimes faster than the underlying business fundamentals can keep up.

**Micro Sentiment: aTyr and the “Policy Darling” Narrative**

On the company level, a clear policy tailwind can have outsized effects on names like ATYR. In practice, what I see is:

- Event-driven funds building positions in anticipation of “policy darling” upside.
- Options volume picking up, with tighter spreads and more directional bets.
- The float becoming constrained as both retail and institutional holders lock in, anticipating a sharper re-rate.
- Analysts and data-driven models recalibrating risk parameters based on voucher eligibility, not just trial outcomes.

Even before any application is filed, the *narrative* alone can move the stock, drive new liquidity, and attract fresh capital. For ATYR, the prospect of CNPV eligibility compresses the risk timeline and increases strategic value well before any final decision is made.

**So what?**
For both sector and stock, these are moments where policy narrative becomes self-fulfilling. A strong enough story can drive flows, price action, and even the “opportunity set” for management teams—long before anything is signed into law. For retail investors, understanding how and why these sentiment shifts happen is as important as tracking the fundamentals.

### 4. CNPV Deep Dive: The New Regulatory Playbook

It’s one thing to hear about a new FDA program; it’s another to understand exactly how it changes the landscape. The Commissioner’s National Priority Voucher (CNPV) program is, in my read, one of those rare regulatory innovations that could reshape both timelines and value for select biotechs—especially for companies approaching late-stage data in an area of high unmet need.

**What is the CNPV?**

The CNPV is a newly introduced FDA pilot program intended to reward companies that align with stated U.S. national priorities—whether that means addressing major public health needs, delivering true innovation, or ensuring domestic manufacturing capacity. Unlike traditional expedited pathways, the CNPV is intended to slash the standard 10–12 month FDA review down to just 1–2 months for qualifying drugs, using a focused, multidisciplinary team approach. Eligibility isn’t automatic: the bar is high, with the FDA reserving vouchers for a small number of programs that demonstrate both scientific merit and operational readiness.

For aTyr and similar names, the difference between being CNPV-eligible and stuck in the standard review queue could mean nearly a year’s worth of time-to-market advantage—pulling value forward, derisking the path, and enabling earlier access to institutional capital and, potentially, strategic buyers.

**How does CNPV compare to previous voucher programs?**

It’s useful to look at how CNPV fits into the broader history of FDA incentives. Here’s a side-by-side comparison:

> ```
> | Feature                      | Priority Review Voucher (PRV)              | Commissioner's National Priority Voucher (CNPV)   |
> |------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
> | Year Launched                | 2007                                       | 2025 (pilot phase)                                |
> | Review Time                  | Reduces to 6 months                        | Reduces to 1–2 months                             |
> | Eligibility                  | Pediatric/tropical/rare diseases           | “National priorities”: public health, innovation, US manufacturing |
> | Number Available             | Limited, set by Congress                   | Very limited, discretionary, FDA pilot             |
> | Transferable/Sellable        | Yes, can be sold or transferred            | No, non-transferable, expires if unused            |
> | Monetary Value               | Sold for $80–$350M (historically)          | No direct sale value, strategic/NPV only           |
> | Application Requirements     | Meet statutory disease criteria            | High bar: readiness, manufacturing, compelling data|
> | Example Impact               | Occasionally sharp spikes in PRV names     | Potential for rapid re-rating, time/value pull-forward |
> | Survives M&A?                | Yes                                        | Yes (retained if company is acquired)              |
> ```

**Why does this matter for ATYR?**

In my view, the CNPV is not “just another expedited box to tick”—it’s a structural wildcard that could transform ATYR’s risk and value path. The possibility of reducing time-to-market by nearly a year is not just about reaching patients faster; it can compress the period of uncertainty, drive a sharp rerating, and expand the pool of institutions willing to own the stock. For any company approaching pivotal data with a shot at a CNPV, this is now a central part of the risk/reward equation.

**So what?**  
Whether or not ATYR secures a CNPV, the mere fact that it’s a contender is already impacting capital flows, sell-side models, and the narrative in both institutional and retail circles. Understanding the specifics of this new playbook is, in my read, essential for anyone tracking the stock.

### 5. ATYR Institutional Case Study

aTyr Pharma ($ATYR) stands out as a textbook example of what policy and capital allocators are now looking for in a “next-generation” biotech. While many companies claim to be innovative or focused on unmet needs, few check as many strategic boxes as aTyr does at this moment in the cycle.

**What makes ATYR the “policy darling” archetype?**

ATYR’s platform and lead program align on nearly every axis that now matters to U.S. regulators, policymakers, and institutional investors:

- **Rare disease focus:** Efzofitimod targets pulmonary sarcoidosis, a rare, serious, and underserved condition with no approved disease-modifying therapies.
- **Innovative science:** The company’s tRNA synthetase platform represents a first-in-class approach with published mechanistic validation (Science Translational Medicine, 2025), and a differentiated immunomodulatory pathway (NRP2).
- **U.S. manufacturing:** ATYR has flagged its domestic manufacturing and technical capabilities, answering a core CNPV and MABA requirement.
- **Operational and regulatory readiness:** The company has Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations, with a global Phase 3 trial now fully enrolled and manufacturing/CMS workstreams underway.
- **Management credibility:** Recent conference appearances, buy-side Q&A, and KOL support all point to a team ready to execute if the opportunity arises.

**How does ATYR compare to the new “policy darling” ideal?**

> ```
> | Policy Darling Attribute       | ATYR Status                                              | Comments                                 |
> |-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
> | Rare Disease Focus            | ✔ Pulmonary Sarcoidosis                                  | Large, under-served U.S. population       |
> | First-in-Class Innovation     | ✔ NRP2/Immune Modulation, tRNA Platform                  | Published translational science           |
> | U.S. Manufacturing            | ✔ Domestic capability, flagged in public disclosures     | Aligns with national priorities           |
> | Regulatory Readiness          | ✔ Orphan + Fast Track, Phase 3 near completion           | CNPV eligible, operationally advanced     |
> | KOL/Advocacy Alignment        | ✔ Strong academic and clinical network                   | Recent high-profile publications          |
> | Institutional Interest        | ✔ Growing event-driven, anchor fund, and crossover base  | See below                                 |
> | Float & Retail Engagement     | ✔ High, passionate retail interest; strategic holder mix  | Float relatively tight, low “dead money”  |
> ```

**Institutional Ownership and Market Positioning**

What’s especially notable at this stage is the pattern of institutional positioning. Over the last two quarters, there’s been a clear shift in the base:

- **Event-driven hedge funds and crossover investors** have increased their allocations, positioning for the combination of clinical catalyst (Phase 3 readout) and policy/regulatory upside (CNPV potential).
- **Anchor institutional holders** (e.g., Federated Hermes, FMR/Fidelity) have maintained or increased positions, even as some quant/multi-strat funds have trimmed for risk management.
- **Options activity** has picked up—tighter spreads, higher open interest at key strike dates, and directional bets around known catalyst windows.

This is, in my experience, classic “setup behavior” for high-conviction, catalyst-driven names. When you see growing alignment between policy narrative, clinical milestones, and capital flows, the risk/reward dynamic changes quickly. The base gets stronger, float can tighten, and price discovery happens faster than in most pre-commercial biotechs.

**So what?**  
ATYR is not just a possible beneficiary of the new policy regime—it is arguably the prototype. This is the kind of profile that CNPV, MAHA, and MABA were designed to support. For investors, the way the shareholder base is evolving—and the growing “policy darling” premium—is a strong signal that the opportunity is being recognized in real time, well ahead of binary clinical outcomes.

---

### 6. Policy to Price Action: Multi-Horizon Impact

One of the most critical (and misunderstood) dynamics in biotech investing is how structural shifts—like the introduction of a voucher program or a change in policy doctrine—actually get reflected in price and market behavior. For aTyr, the intersection of fundamental science, regulatory setup, and policy sentiment now plays out across multiple timeframes.

**Near-term (3–6 months): Sentiment, Narrative, and Positioning**

In the near-term, price action is overwhelmingly driven by anticipation rather than resolution. As the CNPV program and Kennedy doctrine move from headline to implementation, the “policy darling” narrative creates a powerful risk-on bias for names like ATYR.

- **Market mechanics:** Expect rising trading volumes, tighter spreads, and increased options activity (particularly around known event dates—upcoming conferences, Phase 3 data timelines, and FDA communication windows).
- **Institutional rotation:** Funds that would normally sit on the sidelines for binary readouts may begin to establish or scale positions ahead of catalyst windows, not wanting to miss a potentially sharp move.
- **Sell-side behavior:** Analysts may start to model accelerated timelines, raising price targets, and sharpening probability of success estimates, with buy-side risk models recalibrating accordingly.
- **Retail flows:** As the narrative spreads, retail communities tend to accelerate the feedback loop, adding both buying pressure and liquidity, but also volatility.

**So what?**  
The setup for the next few months is one where price action can run well ahead of actual events, fueled by narrative, positioning, and technicals. Even if nothing is “locked in,” the mere possibility of a major timeline pull-forward creates its own gravitational pull on capital and sentiment.

---

**Medium-term (6–18 months): The Phase 3 Data Meets Policy Acceleration**

The pivotal moment for aTyr remains the Phase 3 readout for efzofitimod in pulmonary sarcoidosis. In a standard market, a positive result would lead to an incremental rerate—first on data, then on approval, then on commercial launch. Under the new regime, however, a CNPV-eligible company could compress this cycle into a single, high-magnitude event.

- **Valuation impact:** An 8–10 month acceleration to market fundamentally alters discounted cash flow models, raising NPV and allowing earlier revenue recognition. This is not a minor adjustment—it can mean a double-digit percentage uplift in modeled fair value.
- **Strategic/M&A premium:** The certainty and speed of the CNPV pathway can attract more interest from strategic buyers, as large-cap acquirers value “shovel-ready” assets with clear timelines.
- **Fund flows:** As soon as the market begins to price in voucher eligibility, new buyers (including those previously waiting for de-risked regulatory outcomes) can enter en masse, leading to higher sustained volume and stepwise price moves.
- **Narrative effect:** The “policy darling” label, now validated by regulatory action, can persist as a tailwind, drawing new coverage, higher multiples, and more speculative capital.

**So what?**  
This is where narrative and reality converge. If the policy mechanics deliver, the payoff for being “voucher-ready” can be both immediate (in price action) and durable (in strategic and financial terms). The risk is that if the voucher is denied or delayed, some of this premium may unwind, but the underlying asset quality remains a backstop.

---

**Long-term (2–5 years): The Regime’s Durability, Platform Value, and Sector Lessons**

Looking further out, the story becomes less about the binary event and more about the trajectory of the platform, the sustainability of the policy regime, and the broader lessons for biotech investing.

- **Commercialization and platform expansion:** If efzofitimod reaches market on a compressed timeline, it opens up both earlier revenue and the ability to fund or partner additional indications, creating compounding value for the entire tRNA synthetase platform.
- **M&A and “policy darling” premium:** Should the Kennedy doctrine or its successors persist, the “policy darling” archetype will continue to attract capital, analyst attention, and strategic bids—driving higher average multiples for the cohort.
- **Regime risk:** Of course, political and regulatory cycles are rarely permanent. If the doctrine is reversed, or if vouchers become politicized or overused, the policy premium could erode, reintroducing old frictions and timelines.
- **Sector strategy:** The larger lesson, in my view, is that regulatory and policy structure can be as important as science when it comes to biotech price discovery. Future winners will be those who align their operational, manufacturing, and advocacy strategies with the prevailing regime.

**So what?**  
For investors thinking in years, not months, the real opportunity is to identify which names are positioned to benefit from these cycles repeatedly—not just with one drug, but as a business model. For ATYR, success here validates both its platform and its strategic playbook for future programs.

### 7. Scenario Table: Bull / Base / Bear (With Sentiment Overlay)

The reality for aTyr shareholders is that the payoff matrix is now defined by a blend of science, policy, and sentiment—each shaping not just valuation but the tempo and quality of the market reaction. Here’s how I see the core scenarios playing out from here, mapped across clinical, regulatory, and sentiment axes.

> ```
> | Scenario         | Clinical Outcome        | CNPV Status          | Policy Regime         | Valuation Range*  | Sentiment Overlay            |
> |------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
> | Bull Case        | Clear Phase 3 win      | CNPV granted         | MAHA/MABA persists    | $18–$22+          | Sector re-rates, FOMO flows, event-driven buying, step-change in ownership |
> | Base Case        | Clear Phase 3 win      | Standard review      | MAHA/MABA persists    | $12–$15           | Some premium, but slower ramp; narrative still positive; value realization more gradual |
> | Bear Case        | Data fails or marginal | No CNPV, standard review | Policy regime uncertain or reverses | $1–$3 (cash/platform value) | Sentiment reverses, rotation out, “dead money” risk, retail capitulation  |
> | Wild Card        | Clear Phase 3 win      | CNPV denied/delayed  | Regime shifts, priorities change | $8–$12           | High volatility, potential for sharp reversal, but core thesis remains; longer time-to-value |
> ```
> *Valuation ranges are illustrative, not price targets.

What stands out is that in the current regime, *sentiment is an active variable*, not just a byproduct. In the bull case, it’s not just fundamentals that move the stock—sector FOMO, options positioning, and event-driven flows can drive a much faster and sharper re-rate than any DCF model would suggest. Conversely, if sentiment turns or policy shifts, even solid data can get lost in a sector rotation.

**So what?**  
For anyone navigating ATYR at this juncture, the payoff is asymmetric—but also contingent. The largest wins come when science, policy, and narrative align; the downside, as ever, is that no single lever is guaranteed. For those watching from the sidelines or holding long-term, tracking the sentiment overlay is just as critical as watching the fundamentals.

---

### 8. Broader Lessons for Biotech Investors

There’s a temptation—especially among science-focused investors—to think that clinical results always win out in the end. But what this cycle is reminding us is that *policy can be as powerful a driver of value as the data itself*. The launch of the CNPV, the Kennedy doctrine, and the market’s sharp sensitivity to headlines all illustrate how “policy alpha” can redefine the opportunity set for biotech investors.

**The Power (and Limits) of Policy Alpha**

- **When policy is the catalyst:** The best returns often accrue to companies that are not just innovating scientifically but are aligned with the prevailing regulatory and policy winds. In this regime, being “voucher-ready” or ticking the right policy boxes can matter as much, if not more, than having incremental data alone.
- **Policy darlings vs. incumbents:** It’s increasingly clear that the market can bifurcate overnight—names that fit the current policy narrative (rare disease, U.S. manufacturing, clear public health impact) receive the lion’s share of capital, while incumbents or those on the wrong side of the narrative can see valuation compression regardless of operational success.
- **Sentiment as an accelerant:** Sector ETFs like XBI serve as the real-time barometer for policy sentiment. When the policy tide turns risk-on, capital flows can become self-fulfilling, driving up not only the direct beneficiaries but the whole risk spectrum. Conversely, when sentiment turns or policy focus shifts, even strong names can see sharp corrections.

**What to Look For in Future “Policy Darlings”**

- **Clear alignment with stated priorities:** U.S. manufacturing, innovative mechanisms, targeting large unmet needs, and readiness for accelerated pathways.
- **Management that “gets” the regime:** The best setups come when management teams not only execute scientifically, but also advocate, communicate, and align operationally with the new rules of the game.
- **Float and fund flows:** Watch for tightening floats, step-ups in options activity, and anchor funds that have a track record of recognizing policy-driven runs.

**Investor Takeaways**

- In periods like this, it pays to track the policy calendar as closely as the clinical one.
- Time horizons matter: policy-driven re-ratings can happen much faster (or slower) than many expect. Being positioned before the market “gets it” is often the real edge.
- Finally, be wary of regime risk: cycles shift, and policy premiums can fade as quickly as they arise. The best setups have both policy and scientific durability.

**So what?**  
For those playing in this corner of biotech, the lesson is clear: the intersection of science, policy, and sentiment is where the most asymmetric opportunities (and risks) now reside. The goal isn’t just to predict the next big data readout, but to understand how the rules of the game are being rewritten in real time—and position accordingly.

### Conclusion & Takeaways

Stepping back from the mechanics, the models, and the headlines, I think it’s worth reflecting on why all of this matters for us as investors—regardless of whether you’re institutional or retail, biotech specialist or generalist. The launch of the CNPV, the evolution of policy doctrine, and the way the market has begun to re-rate “policy darlings” like aTyr are more than just interesting events—they’re a clear reminder that the game is always bigger than any one catalyst or company.

Here’s what I want you to really take away:

- The best investors, especially at the institutional level, are constantly mapping these forces—policy, sentiment, market structure—against their own positioning. Even if you’re not hearing about it on FinTwit or CNBC, I can assure you these themes are driving strategy and risk-taking behind the scenes.
- These dynamics aren’t just theoretical. When policies change, or new tools like the CNPV appear, it *reshapes the real opportunity set*—not just for the headline winner, but for every investor with a stake in the sector, and even for broader market psychology.
- There’s value in asking “so what?” at every turn. Whether it’s a new policy lever, a market rotation, or a clinical data release, the edge comes from understanding *how* these elements interact and what the downstream implications could be for sentiment, capital flows, and ultimate returns.

If there’s one meta-lesson here, it’s that learning to think in this multi-dimensional way is itself a source of alpha. Institutions do it by necessity; as individuals, we can choose to do it—and in a market like biotech, where information moves fast and themes evolve overnight, that choice is often what separates the crowd from the contrarians who get paid.

So as you reflect on everything discussed here, I’d encourage you to step back and ask:
- How does this cycle affect my own process?
- What signals and policy shifts am I watching for in other names, other sectors?
- Am I just tracking the obvious catalysts, or am I training myself to spot how institutions and other market players are likely to frame the landscape?

1lhlvhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/RewardVault/comments/1lhlvhi/when_does_taco_bell_stop_serving_breakfast_your/,When Does Taco Bell Stop Serving Breakfast: Your Morning Craving Decoded,"Look, we've all been there. You're dragging yourself out of bed, craving that perfect breakfast that hits different – and your brain's locked onto a Breakfast Crunchwrap. But here's the thing: when does Taco Bell stop serving breakfast? The answer isn't as straightforward as you'd think, and missing that cutoff is basically a morning tragedy.

Most Taco Bell locations stop serving breakfast at 11:00 AM daily, giving you a solid four-hour window to get your fix. But before you set that alarm, there's more to this breakfast game than meets the eye.

# The Real Deal: Taco Bell Breakfast Hours Breakdown

# Standard Breakfast Hours

Taco Bell typically serves breakfast from 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM every day of the week. That's your sweet spot – four hours where you can grab everything from a Cheesy Toasted Breakfast Burrito to those legendary Breakfast Crunchwraps that make mornings worth surviving.

But here's where it gets interesting. Not every location follows the same playbook. Some spots don't crack their doors until 8:00 AM, cutting your breakfast window down to three hours. Others might start at 9:00 AM, which honestly feels like cruel and unusual punishment for late risers.

# Weekend Warriors, Take Note

Weekend breakfast hours can throw you a curveball. Some locations start serving breakfast at 8:00 AM on weekends instead of 7:00 AM, because apparently they think we all want to sleep in. The cutoff time usually stays the same at 11:00 AM, but don't bet your breakfast burrito on it without checking first.

# Why 11 AM? The Science Behind the Cutoff

Taco Bell's 11:00 AM breakfast cutoff gives them a half-hour advantage over competitors like McDonald's, which stops at 10:30 AM. Smart move, honestly. While other chains are already flipping to lunch mode, Taco Bell's giving you that extra 30 minutes to stumble in and order your morning salvation.

The reason they can pull this off? They're not juggling burger patties and breakfast sandwiches on the same grill. Unlike chains that need to clear griddle space for lunch items, Taco Bell's setup allows them to serve breakfast items longer. It's all about that Mexican-inspired flexibility.

# The Plot Twist: Not All Locations Are Created Equal

Here's where things get real. As of late 2024, about 500 out of Taco Bell's 8,500 locations have stopped serving breakfast entirely. Yeah, you read that right. Some franchisees decided breakfast wasn't worth the hassle, leaving early-bird fans completely out of luck.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

The company calls it a ""small minority"" of franchisee-owned stores, but 500 locations doesn't exactly feel small when you're the one showing up to a breakfast-less Taco Bell at 9 AM on a Tuesday.

# How to Check if Your Local Spot Serves Breakfast

Don't just roll up hoping for the best. Use Taco Bell's official store locator to find locations near you that actually serve breakfast. The website's breakfast finder will save you from that soul-crushing moment of discovering your local spot doesn't do morning menus.

Pro tip: Call ahead if you're making a special trip. Hours can change, supplies run out, and equipment breaks down. A quick phone call beats a disappointed stomach every time.

# What to Do When You're Too Late

Missed the 11:00 AM cutoff? Don't panic. All Taco Bell locations still serve hot coffee throughout the day, even if they've ditched the breakfast menu. You can always grab a regular menu item and call it ""brunch"" – nobody's judging your 11:30 AM Crunchwrap Supreme.

# The Menu That's Worth Setting an Alarm For

Let's talk about what you're actually getting during those precious morning hours. Taco Bell's breakfast menu features over 20 items ranging from $1.89 to $7.19, making it one of the most affordable breakfast games in fast food.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

# The Heavy Hitters

**Breakfast Crunchwrap**: The crown jewel of morning Mexican food. It combines scrambled eggs, cheese, hash browns, and your choice of protein wrapped in a warm flour tortilla. It's handheld perfection that won't fall apart in your car.

**Cheesy Toasted Breakfast Burrito**: Available with bacon or sausage, featuring scrambled eggs and melted cheese in a crispy golden tortilla. At $1.89, it's basically stealing.

**Breakfast Quesadillas**: Loaded with fluffy eggs, melted three-cheese blend, and your protein of choice. The steak version hits different when you need that morning protein boost.

# The Supporting Cast

Don't sleep on the sides and add-ons. Hash browns provide that necessary crunch, while Cinnabon Delights offer a sweet finish to balance all that savory goodness. And yes, they've got coffee – because what's breakfast without caffeine?

# Regional Variations and Special Cases

Here's something most people don't know: breakfast hours can vary by region. Urban locations might stick closer to standard 7-11 hours, while suburban spots could start later or end earlier based on local demand. College town locations? They probably figured out students don't wake up before 10 AM anyway.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

Some locations that don't serve breakfast still open by 9:00 AM, so you can still grab regular menu items if you're desperate for that Taco Bell fix in the morning.

# The Evolution of Taco Bell Breakfast

Taco Bell officially launched its breakfast menu nationwide on March 27, 2014, and it's been a wild ride since then. They've added items, removed others, and constantly tweaked the formula to keep breakfast interesting.

The company learned from early mistakes too. They once had items like the Naked Egg Taco and Waffle Taco that didn't quite hit the mark, but they pivoted to focus on familiar breakfast staples that actually make sense.

# What's Coming Next

Breakfast now accounts for 6% of Taco Bell's total sales, proving that people are definitely here for morning Mexican food. The success has led to menu expansions and more locations considering adding breakfast service.

# Making the Most of Your Breakfast Window

# Order Ahead Like a Pro

Use the Taco Bell app to place your order ahead of time. You can skip the line, ensure your items are ready, and avoid that panic when you realize it's 10:55 AM and you're still in the drive-thru.

# Know the Peak Times

If you're rolling up between 8:00-9:00 AM, expect a crowd. Office workers, students, and fellow breakfast enthusiasts are all competing for the same Crunchwraps. Either go early or be patient.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

# Stock Up Strategy

Some breakfast fans grab extra burritos to reheat later. It's not exactly gourmet, but a microwaved Breakfast Crunchwrap beats no breakfast at all when you're running late.

# Comparing the Competition

While McDonald's stops breakfast at 10:30 AM and Burger King cuts off at the same time, Taco Bell's 11:00 AM cutoff gives you that extra breathing room. It's the difference between making it and missing it on those mornings when everything goes wrong.

Sonic and Jack in the Box serve breakfast all day, but let's be honest – they're not bringing the same energy as a fresh Breakfast Crunchwrap at 10:45 AM.

# The Bottom Line

When does Taco Bell stop serving breakfast? The standard answer is 11:00 AM daily, but your mileage may vary depending on location. Some spots start at 7:00 AM, others wait until 8:00 or 9:00 AM, and some don't serve breakfast at all.

Your best bet? Check the store locator, call ahead if you're unsure, and set that alarm for before 10:45 AM to be safe. Because there's nothing worse than showing up for a Breakfast Crunchwrap and being offered a regular taco instead.

The breakfast game at Taco Bell is solid, affordable, and worth the early wake-up call. Just don't sleep on that 11:00 AM deadline – your morning cravings depend on it.

1lhltyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeFriendsUK/comments/1lhltyr/35m_ukbritain_looking_to_make_new_longterm_and/,35M UK/Britain- Looking to make new long-term and genuine friends to hang out and socialise with in person and IRL (Platonic Friendships Only).,"
Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

Before sending me a message, please read the following information below as to what I am, and I am not, looking for in a potential new friend, and friendship.


***WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR:



- People who actually want to make new friends, and are serious and genuinely interested in developing a long-term  friendship (this sounds obvious, but I’m not fully convinced that some people on this app are looking for the exact same thing as me). 



- People who are looking to develop platonic friendships only (I’m not interested in NSFW or people messaging me with non-platonic/romantic/sexual intentions, and so people who are looking for this should look elsewhere for other people who are looking for the same on other apps, like dating apps). 



-People who share common social interests/hobbies, and shared values with me (see above). 



- People who actually want to meet up, regularly where possible, in person and IRL, and socialise and do social activities together in person. 



- People who are in the same country as me (i.e Britain), and preferably nearby regions (e.g London, East Midlands, West Midlands etc). 






****WHAT I AM NOT LOOKING FOR, AND WHICH ARE RED FLAGS FOR ME: 



- People who want online friendships only (I am really not interested in online-only friendships, as I’m looking to meet people who actually want to meet up in person in real life, and are physically able to do so, without any time zone distances). 


-People who don’t actually want to build friendships, but are only on this app because they are bored or lonely in the moment, and want to someone to chat with to pass the time (I am really not interested in these type of people, and I ask you to please not message me if that is what your intentions are, as I will not respond). 


- People who give one-word responses or one-line responses, and make little or no effort, or a lack of effort, to have an actual detailed and engaging conversation. If this is you, I ask you to not message me. I firmly believe that friendship is a two-way street, and I am fully invested in getting to know someone as a person, and likewise, I would expect the other person is willing to reciprocate the same level of effort I put in, and show real interest and engagement with me as a person. 


- People who want to mess with people  and play with their emotions by having one conversation with them, or short-term chats and conversations, and then subsequently ghosting or blocking them (whether on this app or elsewhere on other social media). If this is you, please don’t message me, as I will not respond. Ghosting is extremely cruel, hurtful and disrespectful to do on people, and nobody deserves to be treated this way. 


-People who lead other people on and make them believe they want a genuine friendship with them, and want to meet up with them, only for them to turn out to be fake, and drop that new potential friend, and disappear without explanation (see the issue of ghosting above). If this is you, please don’t message me, as I will not respond. I am very serious about making new friends, and I don’t appreciate people stringing me along and faking interest in me, and then ultimately blocking or ghosting me. I want people who are genuinely interested in getting to know me, and are willing to put actual time and effort into developing a platonic friendship with me. 


-People who lie, and are deceitful and dishonest about themselves, and their life. To be blunt, I hate liars, and they are not welcome in my life. I want to have friends who are honest and have integrity, and so having trust and respect for each other in a friendship is essential. If you are a person who habitually lies and strings people along, then I ask you to please stay away from me, and not message me. I have been hurt very badly by people in the past who I previously considered friends, but who eventually turned out to be the opposite, by lying to me. Just to be clear, if you get to know me and become friends with me, and then I subsequently catch you trying to lie to or deceive me in any way (it doesn’t matter if that is during our first conversation, or a few months down the line, or a year later etc), any friendship you have with me will be immediately over. I will never give a second chance to someone who lies to me. 


-People who live in other international countries. Whilst I am happy to have international friends, I am specifically looking to make new friends who live in the same country as me, as this will give more opportunities to meet up in person and do social activities together IRL. Having friends to meet up in person regularly is something I’m really lacking in my life right now, and so having friends to meet IRL is key for me when looking for new friends now. For me, it doesn’t matter if the people I meet are not nationals of the country (as in not born in or from the country) I am based in, however, it is essential that they are living on a permanent and long-term basis in the same country as where I am.

(LONG LONG POST IM SORRY)","Hello! Mostly just need to vent a little, but im also feeling a lot better so im using this as a reflection, and to look back on when i want my second kid and go ""oh no no you dont wait right there think about this"". I just passed the 20 week mark, and im FINALLY keeping down meals. This was my first pregnancy, and very much wanted.

Sorry for weird formatting and such. I just want my thoughts down lol.

Im in my early 20s. Starting weight was 210. 5'7. I was overweight, ive teetered on obese a lot, but overall most of the weight was in my hips, thighs, and butt. Medium to large tops, but a 2x in pants. At my first pregnancy confirmation, id already been puking multiple times a day, id gone down to 206 by about 6 weeks.

I started taking unisom and b6, which helped for the first few weeks, but overall didnt do much after I crossed the 10 week mark. I stopped taking it completely around there and felt no difference, aside from better sleep because sleep aids mess with me.

I ended up in the ER the first time, and weighed in at about 190 give or take. I was still overweight so they werent concerned with the loss, but I got an IV zofran and some oral tablets. They sometimes took the edge off of the gagging, but if my body wanted to puke it did.

Around the 10 week mark I ran out of zofran, and my OB wouldnt give me more. I weighed in at 185 for that first appointment, and that was the first time the OB themselves saw me, so they saw nothing bad, told me to try ginger and some lollipops, Eventually I begged them for something, and he gave me Scopolamine and Promethazine. I was weary of taking those, as ive taken them in the past for super duper motion sickness and they were VERY hit or miss, either making me dizzy, more nauseous, or just overall meh feeling. I asked for zofran again, he said no. I ended up rawdogging the puking until about 15 weeks. My 15 ish week weigh in was about 172, the lowest ive recorded.

I went to my PCP, he gave me Zofran, but in 8 mg tablets. I was pill cutting them, and for some reason the 8 mg ones in half worked a LOT better this time around. Maybe because I was around 15 weeks and it was already starting to pass, but they did wonders for me. I would take one before even lifting my head up in the morning, and if i took it every 6 hours or so and made sure to never sit on empty (even after puking), i could feel somewhat normal. I stagnated at 176 for a solid 2 months, but I stopped losing.

Today, If i take one zofran in the morning, I can exist with only puking once or twice in the day with no extra doses. I do take another if im about to get in the car or go to an event, but 4mg/day (of the 8 pills cut) is enough for me to feel normal. Im back up, and weighing in at 182, which im thankful for.  
  
\[EDIT TO ADD: I do have a very bad mindset of taking the LEAST amount of a drug as possible if i can help it. Doesnt matter if its a pain killer, symptom easer, or what. The only thing I dont budge on is antibiotics, ill take those fully, but if i can feel marginally better with a tiny bit of something, id rather do that. That was probably my biggest downfall looking back, I should have taken more stuff.\]

Still havent had a proper ultrasound yet. I can feel him squirming around in there, and ive felt hiccups a few times. The anatomy scan is on the 25th, and im paranoid that ive got low fluids, low birth weight, or some other terrible side effect from being malnourished. Im hitting milestones, felt flutters around 16-20 weeks, my boobs are sore and have started leaking, im not so malnourished I cant produce milk. I \*might\* be able to be feeling kicks. I dont think my husband knows what to look for, but especially with my belt, I can feel him pounding sometimes. NIPT came back all normal.

My body took a weird hit from the weight loss. I still dont look pregnant, I didnt have much belly fat to begin with, but unless you super super look, I dont have a bump yet, and it could very easily be mistaken for post taco bell. My jean size went from a 38 to a 34, and I ended up needing to tighten my belt. My waist is still smaller than before I got pregnant. My jeans are looser in the thighs, hips, and butt, and theres noticeable extra fabric. My shirt size stayed a medium, Large if it was bunching in the shoulders. My cup size went up by about 4 inches, and my strap size down by 1in. My face got a lot more hollow, my jawline got sharper, my cheeks almost looked a bit sunken in on the top, but my glands did look a little swollen near my jawbone. My arms definitely look thinner, and my husband commented on that as well.

Going into the pregnancy, I had a mindset of ""im going to stay away from any food that could be slightly harmful. Im going to eat clean, avoid any deli meat, prepackaged fruits, soft cheeses, ANY sushi, any cross contamination risk. Cut out all sodas, caffeine, the whole drill. I wanted to be healthier anyways, perfect time for that.

Ive developed a really bad aversion to foods that made me puke the most. There are ones that resulted in such violent outburts, that if i see them now, even on a store shelf, my stomach churns. Things like PBJ, watermelon, Ramen, Canned salmon, Alfredo, etc, are going to take a while for me to enjoy.

The ONLY FOOD Ive yet to puke up this pregnancy, is subway. Ive always loved loved subway, went every sunday with a 2 for 10 deal for years, reminds me of my husband and i's early days, im addicted to the herbs and cheese bread, its just so good. I swore it off for pregnancy because of lysteria in the deli meat, and questionable standards, and I hate my sandwiches cold. It was the only thing i wanted to eat for a while, even through my nausea, and I decided to concede. Best choice of this pregnancy. Its the only thing Ive kept down with a 100% success rate, and the fear of malnutrition and also the entire misery ive been put through outweighs the risks for me. Im pretty sure the 10 pounds ive gained is purely from these damn sandwiches.

I also caved on caffeine. I was a 1-2 monster energy drinker per day pre pregnancy. I cut them cold turkey, but again, i just missed them. I was so miserable, i felt so crappy on my low days, I ended up having 2 or 3 a month. I space them out, and sometimes i wont even finish the whole can, but they make me feel like myself again. The summer peach redbull is the best flavour ive ever put in my mouth. These things were sent from god and I cant even enjoy them to my fullest desire. Id drink 10 right now.

I caved on preprepared fruits, and i eat California rolls now too. I ate the sketchy potato salad that was sitting out after a celebration of life, and I had an iced mocha from the local coffee shop with my husband. Bagged Caesar salads have become a favourite of mine. I feel really guilty that im not taking the utmost precautions, but honestly some days without subway I dont think id choke anything down.

I know the info in here is probably too sporadic and specific to help anyone, but maybe someone will relate? It just feels good to kinda document stuff I guess. I feel like im doing a poor job of being a mother already, but I also know that those early days were ROUGH. I lost my job cause of this crap, but as long as I get my kid in my arms, im sure ill be fine. Its looking up from here at least.",1,1750592085.0,HyperemesisGravidarum,0,1.0,False

1lhlqy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakingPoints/comments/1lhlqy6/are_we_at_war/,Are We at War?,"Just some thoughts over coffee. 

Like everyone I’m concerned about the US bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities drawing us into war. It’s difficult to see any upside to this war even for the Israelis. Iran is a country of 92 million people to Israel’s 9 million. Supposedly Iran has a large stockpile of advanced missiles. Supposedly Iran has affiliated military and militia groups across the region. 

However, what we have learned from all the wars of the last 50 years is it’s impossible to win a war from the air. You can bomb the shit out of a place and the enemy will still resist. The civilian populace will strengthen their resolve. If you could win a war through bombing, the war in Gaza would be over already. 

Israel and Iran both completely lack offensive capabilities to conduct a ground war with each other. They don’t share a border and neither can project an invading force. All they can do is continue to exchange bombs. The US dropping a few bunker busters is one thing; an invasion is an entirely different matter. 

Something is really off in Iran. After decades of hearing what a 900 pound gorilla Iran is- what happened? For one thing the Ayatollah Khamenei is 86. No matter how spry and divine he is, he obviously is not on top of his game. For Israel to kill off an entire layer of Iranian leadership and have free rein in the skies in a matter of days reveals the Iranians are a paper tiger being led by an out of touch old man. There was a serious leadership  vacuum even before the bombs started falling. 

My prediction for now is Trump will try to declare victory. Israel will unsuccessfully press the US for invasion and regime change. Iran will remain hobbled and relatively impotent as long as Khamenei is alive. Without any overall strategy any terror attacks or attacks on US troops will be isolated and performative. At this point even if Iran gets effective leadership it will take years for them to rebuild. Keep in mind their allies and surrogates in the region have already been defanged. 

Missiles will continue to fall on Israel, the US will likely lose some service members, and limited scale terror attacks are possible. Such is the price of war. It’s difficult to see this escalating much beyond that. ",0,1750591957.0,BreakingPoints,8,0.5,False

I was sailing solo, stayed in one of the studio suites, booked 3 excursions through Norwegian, and had Norwegian book my flights for me. This was my first sailing with Norwegian, and my 2nd cruise overall. 

1. The flights: I flew from Tampa to Chicago to Toronto to Reykjavik. Thankfully, everything was mostly on time. So there were no issues other than the fact that it was a REALLY long day because of all of the layovers and many time changes. By time I got to Reykjavik, it was cold and rainy, and my heavy coat was in my checked bag that I had already handed over to the ship to take to my room. If there was any regret in how I arrived, it was me not taking my coat out of my checked bag. Because of this, it was too cold and rainy (and I was too sleep deprived) to explore the town. I can't wait to explore Reykjavik eventually, but this sadly was not the trip for that, given the circumstances. My flight back to Tampa is a direct flight thankfully. 

2. Studio suite. It's a tiny room, but the bathroom area is especially beautiful...fake white marble. Good water pressure that gets sufficiently hot even for cold Icelandic and Norwegian nights. I didn't use the community lounge much that was designed for us studio suite folks, but I loved that it had an espresso/latte machine and fresh fruit always on hand for our consumption when I didn't feel like dealing with crowds. I loved the accommodations overall. 

3. Excursions: I went on the following excursions: Jewels of the North in Akureyri Iceland, Fjord Explorer's Dream in Alesund, and Bruges in a Day in Zeebrugge. I would 100% recommend Jewels of the North...very accurate to the description and tons to see. I would 75% recommend Fjord Explorer's Dream...the views were impeccable and lunch delicious, but we were riding in a coach bus for the majority of the 7 hours much to my surprise. I would 50% recommend Bruges in a Day...it was a narrated walking tour to sites you could have easily seen without a tour guide, there was no sit-down meal provided (although we did get a voucher for a free waffle), but the 30-minute boat ride was cute. 

4. The ship. This might be a hot take because I know Prima isn't regarded very highly, but I absolutely adored this ship for this cruise. I love Norwegian's ""freestyle"" dining, where you have several complimentary dining rooms to pick from, and you can go whenever you want. It was too cold for the pool most days...so the tiny pool (it is embarrassingly tiny) wasn't a concern. Practically every community space was busy during peak hours, but you could easily beat the crowds if you're an early riser (get to the Observation Lounge before 10 AM, and you'll probably find a seat just fine). I had breakfast in Surfside (the main buffet) every morning...it was very chaotic, but I was able to find a seat every morning when I got there no later than 7 AM. 

5. Solo Excursions: I never spent a single day on the ship if I didn't need to. Therefore, if I wasn't doing excursions with Norwegian, I went on solo excursions myself. In Isafjordur Iceland, I found a beautiful nature trail that went on for a few miles that I would absolutely recommend. In Flam Norway, I hiked a mountain to a waterfall in the rain and sweat way more than I probably should have given how cold and rainy it was (it wasn't an easy hike by any means). In Bergen, I hiked an even bigger mountain in the rain (sweat more, and had a bit of a panic attack when I didn't see a single person for over 30 minutes in my most anxious ""I have no idea how to get down from this mountain"" state of mind). In Amsterdam, I explored downtown in the warm sunshine, and enjoyed a nice lunch and coffee at local restaurants. 

6. Spa: My electric shaver decided to turn itself on during my flight to Iceland and was dead by time we arrived. Because I don't trust myself with razors, I paid the barber to give me one shave and one shave with a facial. The shave cost me around $90. The shave with facial was a little over $100 (he kindly gave me $50 off). To be honest, neither shave was that great, but at least I didn't get any razor bumps. I also did an acupuncture session, which was my first time doing acupuncture. I learned I don't enjoy acupuncture, and although I'm sure many people would have enjoyed it, I didn't appreciate them trying to sell me additional sessions, supplements, and all sorts of other things at the end of my session. Overall, I did not enjoy my experiences with the spa on my ship. 

7. My Future with Norwegian: First off, I would absolutely recommend this itenerary on Prima, especially if you're a solo traveler. I did talk to a lot of people throughout my travels, but the overwhelming majority of what I did was done solo, which I loved. I loved how affordable the cruise itself was, even if there was a bit of nickeling and diming. All said and done, you get what you pay for, and I had a damn good experience overall. I took advantage of CruiseNext by paying $500 on the ship to get a $1,000 credit for my upcoming Japanese cruise in 2027. 

Thank you to the crew of Norwegian Prima and the wonderful people of Northern and Central Europe for such a memorable and relaxing vacation! Although I enjoyed my cruise with Royal Caribbean a couple of years ago, currently my loyalty is definitely to Norwegian instead many thanks to their destinations, their freestyle dining, and their recent innovations in more ""boutique"" style ships with the Prima class. 

If you book this cruise, be sure to pack rain gear, winter gear, and several pairs of shoes. You will get rained on a lot, and your shoes will smell terrible if you only bring one pair. I brought two pairs of shoes, and that still wasn't enough for how much rain there was. ",2,1750591908.0,NCL,2,1.0,False

I lost 40lbs, have cried more than I thought possible, and have been faced with the incredibly complicated nature of her life and how it led to her death.  We were all victims of an abusive father who struggled with addiction.  He died just before he turned 50.  She almost died just before her 50th birthday and I begged her in the ICU, don't be like Daddy.  She miraculously pulled through and made it for another 99 days.  Made it to her 50th birthday!  Her first sober birthday in a long time.  And then when I couldn't get her in the phone one morning, I went to check on her and found what remained.  She would be heartbroken that I found her, but we were so close, it couldn't have been anyone else.  

Most days I am ok now.  I am working and eating and laughing again, but the loss sits there, just under the surface, waiting.  I got up early this morning for no reason.  I let my dogs out, tended to my chickens in the cool of the day and noticed how beautiful the sky was.

Some background context before I rant: I'm currently 18 and turning 19 in 8 days. When planning our hangout, my friends have left most decisions up to me because it's my birthday soon. I guess they want to give me the most choice as their collective 'gift' to me before my actual birthday. (I don't think they need to but I appreciate the thought) It may also be important to mention that I often don't remember names of places, I remember what they look like. Two important (code) names to remember: Mary (19) and Rosie (18).



So me and my friends have recently been planning to catch up during the school holidays, since all of us are busy with post graduation lives, or are still in school and busy with schoolwork. There was a lot of back and forth on what day to catch up and do something because we're all available on different days, but we eventually decided on next Tuesday. We decided we would go to a cafe, get coffee and have a chat as our hangout. Now here's where the problem comes in.

My friend group tends to be a bit disorganised and last minute with making plans. This annoys me a bit because, while I do admit I'm a bit last minute as well, they tend to finalise plans one day before or the day of any activity, which I think is inconvenient and annoying. (still love them though lol)

Everyone has been discussing different cafes and making each other very confused on what cafe we're all going to. It's now come down to two cafes: (these are nicknames btw because I don't wanna get doxxed) toffee coffee and afternoon hour. I originally wanted to go to afternoon hour, because I walked past one of their cafe's with my mum recently and it seemed like a nice spot. When I brought it up with my friends, one of them, Mary, mentioned they wanted to go because they know it has a ""view of the lake"" and it's close to a local area. I was like ""but there isn't a lake?? It isn't even near (the local area)??"" And we all got confused. So Rosie searched up the cafe she meant so we could see and...drumroll...very funny and not at all depressing coincidence!!

It's the same cafe I went to with my family for mother's day and had to watch my dad be the spitting image of a non chivalrous miserable sod to my mother. I won't go into detail but long story short he hated the cafe, whinged and whined about it all day to me, and then sat back and let my mum pay for our household's meals. (when it's MOTHER'S DAY and she shouldn't have to pay for her own fucking lunch)  The real kicker is when we left, he said he wouldn't whine about the cafe to her and ruin her day, then he started whining about something else to her. So yeah, not great memories.

I immediately cringed at the thought of going there again and being reminded of that disaster, so I recorded a voice note, and told the groupchat I was uncomfortable with going to that specific cafe, and could we go to another afternoon hour cafe, or somewhere else please. One of my friends, Mary, listened to the voice note and understood, but the friend who brought up the cafe I didn't want to go to, Rosie, didn't respond to it. She messaged something directly after that something along the lines of: ""okay this is the plan: at \_\_\_time we're going to afternoon hour (the one I don't want) and doing \_\_\_then going home at \_\_\_."" This really annoyed me because not only had I asked if we could not go to that specific cafe, we had also not discussed the ending time of our hangout. The fact that she just decided all of that for everyone shows me she obviously didn't listen to my voice message. Mary referenced my voice message and corrected her along the lines of ""no the plan is toffee coffee"" Rosie said ""oh"" and edited her message to say ""toffee coffee."" After she randomly dropped in an RSVP invitation for her birthday party in July,  and we discussed arrangements regarding that, I then asked Rosie if we're going to toffee coffee or afternoon hour, because I was so confused. Now here's the cherry on top. She said we're going to afternoon hour ""the one in (the local area),"" and pulled up that same fuckass Google maps search and images again.

I'm sorry but I'm just so fucking annoyed because I said I didn't want to go to that cafe and even though Rosie did change her message in the groupchat outlining the plans, she still is adamant on going to that fuckass cafe when she was told that's not happening anymore. Now everyone is gonna have the wrong idea and make me to go to that cafe. It feels exhausting trying to plan this and I honestly don't wanna go anymore, I might just say I'm sick or something and dip. I do want to see my friends again but not at that cafe, and Rosie doesn't seem to be getting the message, and because of her nobody else will. The hangout is in two days and I don't know what to do.

When I was 8, after a diptheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine, I started to gain weight and became moderately overweight and also developed gynecomastia. Around the same time I started to experience congestion in the sinuses which slowly extended to a feeling of congestion all over the head and upper face. From the age of 22 I also started to get chronic back and neck pain. Over the years I've also experienced low libido and low energy in general.   

I have been seeing a doctor in the US for the last 4 years who works with heavy metal removal from the body, and using a mix of supplements, low-carb diet, coffee enemas I have been able to release lead, mercury, aluminum, nickel from my body, as shown in a hair tissue mineral analysis test. My chronic pain is gone, and energy is better, but other issues remain. 

I am looking to supplement this treatment with ayurvedic treatment. 

However, my experience with ayurvedic doctors is that they do not talk much about how to remove heavy metals from the body. Frequently they advise a vegetarian diet which will contradict the low-carb, ketogenic, meat based diet my practitioner has advised me to do. I would still want to have what I am doing currently as my primary treatment and use ayurveda secondarily. 

Any suggestions on a good ayurvedic doctor who may understand these symptoms and their connection to heavy metals and vaccines?

Also, I have been reading on ayurveda myself and would be curious if someone would like to share how ayurveda sees heavy metal toxicity, its effects on the body, and what methods it uses to remove these metals. ",1,1750591643.0,Ayurveda,0,1.0,False

For most guys I worked with, that just meant divorce papers or old back injuries. But me?
I keep thinking about a stretch of highway around Front Royal, Virginia.

Two-lane blacktop, maybe twelve miles total. Covered in trees and brush on both sides like most rural highways in Warren County. Nothing special. But I cleaned that road for twelve years.

Picked up raccoons, deer, the occasional unlucky dog. I knew every curve, every mile marker, every dip where the fog clung low in the mornings.

And I swear to heaven above, something out there wasn’t right. I’d seen a lot over those years, but there was one time—one thing—I can’t explain.

I’m not one to talk about this sort of thing. Hell, I’m not even the kind of guy that thinks about this sort of thing. But now that I’m retired, out here in Arizona with nothing but time, dry air, and no trees—I figure maybe it’s time to get it off my chest. You don’t have to believe me. I wouldn’t blame you if you didn’t.

All I know is, something was taking those bodies before I could get to them. And it wasn’t any predator I’d seen before.

Back then, my mornings all started the same. Coffee in a thermos. Local country station on low. Clipboard with the day’s calls tucked between the seats. I had a route, and I stuck to it. I truly was always a creature of habit. County sent in roadkill reports through dispatch—citizens would call, or a deputy would log it, and I’d swing by to clean it up before it started to stink or attract scavengers.

Most days it was just me, the road, and the buzz of cicadas. Peaceful work, really. Gross sometimes, yeah—but it gave me time to think. Or not think, which some days was just as good.

Only thing you never really get used to is the smell. Hot, rotting meat on asphalt.

But around the spring of that year, something changed.

It started with a buck that got clipped out by mile marker 112. I remember it clear because it was supposed to be a “messy one,” according to the report. When I pulled up, there was nothing. No fur, no bone fragments, no chunks. Just a cracked bit of plastic in the ditch—part of a busted headlight maybe. The only thing left of that deer was a wet spot on the road—but no deer.

I figured maybe a local had come and dragged it off for meat. Wouldn’t be the first time. Folks out that way didn’t waste much. So I checked it off and kept going.

Next day? Same thing. Possum outside of Riverton called in around 6 a.m. I was there by 6:30—nothing. Not even a bloodstain.

Three days in a row. Then five. Then more.

It got to the point where every time I showed up, there was nothing left to clean.

At first, I thought maybe someone else was doing my job. New hire, maybe? County loves not telling you when they make a change. I called my supervisor, Tracy, to ask.

“You get beat to it again?” she laughed. “Nope. Far as I know, you’re still the only one with a strong enough stomach to do it. Maybe the vultures got ambitious.”

Except vultures don’t carry away full-grown deer without leaving so much as a stain.

Still, I didn’t push it. Less cleanup meant more coffee breaks. I got to sit longer in the shade, maybe sneak a little nap here and there. I wasn’t about to complain.

But then the calls stopped altogether.

A week went by with no assignments. Then two. Tracy called me in and said the county was “re-evaluating the budget.”

That’s when I started to worry.

I still remember her words:
“If there ain’t nothin’ to clean, we might not need someone on salary to not clean it.”

Funny how fast peace turns to panic.

About a week after that talk with Tracy, I started getting nervous. Not just about the job—about the silence.

See, the woods never go completely quiet out here. Even when there’s no cars, no birds—there’s always something. Wind in the trees, bugs in the grass. But lately, there’d been mornings where the whole world felt… paused. Like the trees were holding their breath.

One morning, around 5:30, I took a different route out of habit. Just me, low beams, and a fog so thick it felt like I was pushing through it. No call had come through that day—nothing on the sheet—but I figured I’d check an old stretch out near the Shenandoah River turnoff anyway. Sometimes folks didn’t bother calling if it was small.

And sure enough, there it was.

A fox, I think. Hard to tell—it was half-twisted, bloody, fur slick with dew and road grime. I slowed to a crawl. Rolled the window down. Something about it made me feel… watched.

I was about to flip on the hazards when I saw movement in the fog.

Just ahead, barely ten yards from my bumper, something hunched low darted across the road and stopped—right over the body.

I froze.

Couldn’t see much—just a silhouette. Not a coyote. Not a man, either. Its limbs moved wrong. Too fast. Too twitchy.

I reached for the work light in the passenger seat, but by the time I clicked it on and swept it forward, the thing was gone. So was the fox.

Nothing but skid marks and a faint smear left behind.

I stepped out, slow. The air smelled like wet iron and something else… like rotting leaves. I don’t remember hearing a single sound—not even a cicada in a Virginia summer.

I stood there for a minute, listening.

Nothing.

When I got back in the truck, my hands were shaking just enough to make the keys rattle when I turned the ignition.

Didn’t say a word to Tracy. What would I even say?

But that was the first time I started to feel it deep in my bones—that something was out there, doing my job. And doing it too fast.

After that, I started carrying a flashlight bigger than my forearm and a tire iron under the seat. Felt silly. But not as silly as getting mauled by some backwoods freak of nature on a lonely stretch of road.

The next couple weeks were quiet. No calls. No sightings. No weirdness. I started thinking maybe I’d imagined it. Maybe it had been a coyote with mange. Brains play tricks—especially in fog.

Then came the night out by Morgan’s Ford.

I was driving home late—earlier than usual but still after dark—when I caught the glint of something off the shoulder. Not glass. Not reflection. Eyeshine.

It was hunched over a small body in the gravel. Looked like a raccoon. The thing raised its head and stared right at me. Eyes wide, unblinking. Its ribs showed through its sides, heaving like a bellows.

This time I didn’t fumble. I hit the brights and stepped out with the flashlight.

It didn’t run.

Didn’t growl either.

It stood up—not all the way—and backed off slow, watching me the whole time.

I crept forward, light steady in my hand, and that’s when I saw what it really was.

A mountain lion. Skinny, sick-looking. Ribs like piano keys. Eyes glassy, foam at the corners of its mouth.

It must’ve been dying. Starved half to death. That’s why it moved the way it did—low and twitchy, like its muscles didn’t know what to do.

I took a step back. It didn’t follow.

Just slunk off into the trees, dragging the raccoon like it couldn’t afford to leave a single scrap.

I watched the woods for a long time after that.

Eventually I got back in the truck, heart still racing, but something like relief settled in my gut.

Made sense, didn’t it? Big cat. Starving. Scavenging roadkill.

For a couple days, I even believed it.

But deep down, something still didn’t sit right. That cat didn’t move that fast. And it didn’t explain the fox that disappeared in front of me. Or why there was never a trace left behind.

Predators tear things up. That’s nature. Messy. Loud. Visceral.

Whatever took that fox hadn’t just been quiet.

It was silent.

There’s a little place just outside Front Royal called Darby’s. Cheap drinks, country songs on the jukebox, and a bartender who doesn’t ask too many questions. I wasn’t much of a drinker back then, but that night, I needed something to take the edge off.

Tracy had called earlier. Budget hearing next week. “No decisions made yet,” she said—which is how you know the decisions have already been made.

I sat at the far end of the bar nursing a bourbon. Not my usual, but beer felt too light for the mood I was in.

That’s when I noticed the kid.

Maybe twenty-three. Laughing too hard. Throwing back shots like he had something to prove. When he stumbled out with keys already in his hand, I waited a few minutes. Paid my tab. Made sure I wasn’t tailing him—just… keeping distance.

One second, everything was normal.

Next second, the light of an oncoming tractor trailer disappeared.

Then came the sound.

Metal. Screaming tires. Shattering glass.

I hit the brakes.

The kid had drifted lanes. Hit the truck head-on. His car was a cage of twisted steel and smoke. The truck cab was sideways across the road, one headlight dangling like a popped eye.

I grabbed the flashlight, called 911, and ran.

I was halfway there when I saw it—movement near the wreck.

A figure, tall and thin, crouched low, pulling something from the broken glass like it weighed nothing.

“Hey!” I shouted. “Do you need help?”

The figure turned. Slowly. Its face was wrong. Angled strange, like it had too many joints and not enough muscle.

Its voice was wet and hollow.

“No. Go back to your car.”

I stood frozen.

Then something moved behind it. Then another.

I never saw the hit. Just a flash of light and pain like lightning in my skull.

When I woke up, I was in the back of an ambulance.

The police asked what I saw. I told them half the truth. Enough to be believed. Enough to sleep that night.

Two weeks later, I requested reassignment.

A year after that, I retired.

Last week, I saw a news article from back home:

“Young Man Missing After Late-Night Crash on Route 340.”

Same road. Same vanishing act.

I hovered over the keyboard. Thought about reaching out. Thought about telling them what I saw that night.

But what would I say?

That there’s something out there collecting bodies—cleaning the roads like I used to?

I closed the laptop.

Made some coffee.

Stepped outside.

Putting myself out there a bit. I'm a 37-year-old guy living in London. Life's pretty good, but it's always nice to meet new people, right?

A few things I enjoy:

* **Swimming:** You'll often find me doing laps at the local pool – it's my go-to for clearing my head and staying active. Always happy to chat about good spots or even find a swimming buddy.
* **Photography:** I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr:[https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/)

As someone who runs n8n and can get combined workflows using o3, Sonnet-4, Perplexity Sonar Pro all working together, and popping inputs/outputs in both Discord and Telegram, my bill is far far lower per month.  I looked over all my tasks from midnight to midnight for yesterday.  Total calls for the main thinking process, 101.  Quick 2.5-Flash, and the entire collection ran for 1 hour and 53 minutes.  So, basically 2 hours of runtime out of 24.  Chat, deep research, perplexity searching, reads Reddit, reads my gmail and calendar, HTTP direct request puller, works with local files, has a nice vector store db backend, uses all the leading models, and can call OpenAI Codex for needed python, curl, calcs, searching notes, making notes, etc in a dedicated docs github repo.  Does it work? I dunno, it was tracking B-2's at my 6pm EST 4 X daily update last night, 4 hours before the world went full panic mode.  You tell me, my OSINT module working well? ;)

Only other cost I can add to this is infrastructure and salaries, and that can definitely push them up higher.  But, doesn't mean it can't be improved greatly (below).

I dunno what those guys run per task on this time-wise or model-wise, but $10 for me would be a hair more than my total day's work today, cost-wise, on leading models, and that's split between direct APIs mostly, OpenRouter, and runs directly on known interfaces, not just one device.  I'm actually wondering about making mine available via my Rabbit R1 just because that sounds cool and does what I really want from the Rabbit.

You might find the meta-prompt at the bottom useful for your Claude Code.  I know in the less impressive Codex, it brings order to complete chaos that is OpenAI's less than stellar (I'm being generous) coding ability.

Rest of this is more geared towards Rabbit devs and 0-shot vibey ideas.  Been doing AI since the private API days a year before ChatGPT went public, so I have some thoughts. ;)

I get not everyone wants to wire up their own system using something like n8n.  But let me use my setup to example some alternative ideas:

First, I can absolutely CRUSH some credits.  I dropped my ChatGPT Pro $200 to pay for what I spend now, so I get the token craziness.  But I also decided to put in o3 instead of o4-mini-high.  I use crazy expensive Sonnet-4 purely for personality, with gpt-4.1 gets me there at far less cost.  My use case is actual assistant, OSINT, and second brain without reading another Tiago Forte book.  So yes, this ain't vibe coding for 2 hours a day. But 2 hours of o3 and/or Sonnet-4 is pretty much more than anything this is doing.  I'm running around $300/mo, currently.  Coding, not coding, all the models care about are input and output context windows and thinking tokens. A token is a token is a token, and I can max out those little 200k windows Sonnet gives out so easily, I have intermediate models summarizing the vector db calls just to avoid erroring out.  This is why large codebases are a pita for all models right now, not to mention the needle-in-haystack issues with those with even large enough context windows.  But I'm in the weeds, let me get back on track.

However... we have the same models, and I also get choices between sonnet and 4.1 as my goto's there (I'm a cursor guy, tried the rest, stuck with the best, ymmv).

I have two major suggestions for whatever is happening here, and or any other devs:

Suggestion 1, AI Tiers are Super Easy

Using a few config setups, there should be three key ways to reduce costs in the Intern app.  First, limit time on task.  Simple as that, turn down the iterations.  Second, turn down thinking, high medium, low, and low is surprisingly good in most, difference is 70% success vs 75% success.  That's actually huge, but hey, most outputs are fixable at 70%.  Too many people married to 0-shot/1-shot anyways. Even with Sonnet and o3, I run everything on diffs and do work checks.  If it ain't 100%, it ain't 100%, 70-75% still means running fixes. Third, turn down the model entirely.  Go mini, or go from Claude to OpenAI.  Go to artificialanalysis and find the model that reaches the same thresholds you need at a slightly lower price point.  No, intelligence isn't equal, but that's the point of a lower tier.

""But, it's FAR less impressive,"" I hear someone shouting from the back of the room.  Yes, $19.99/mo for an all grok-3-mini-high solution, with time based constraints (code pauses, req per day limit of 1, limit 15 min runtime per task, etc etc) is going to be far less impressive than $99/day, which would be my cost at my run time and requirements. I went from GPT Pro to GPT free, because I don't need it anymore.  GPT free is far far less impressive.  I don't even have old projects anymore and those were glorified folders.  Less impressive is the point.  And it's also a nice little try a little buy before you buy a lot, and makes giving out a few free uses far easier and less costly. Using grok-3-mini will be night and day from gemini-2.5-pro, o3:high, and Sonnet-4... but it won't be unusable, just less useful, because it's supposed to be.  And, still makes the Rabbit usage impressive.  Grok 3 Mini (regardless of you-know-who) is actually impressive as hell on the benches.  Slap on some 2.5-Flash for smaller tasks. Maybe throw in a little premium model to kick things off, o3:low, Grok 3 (full), Gemini-2.5-Pro... one per day on any of those will cost next to nothing still.  It can set up the overall task project, and let the little bots get to work (meta-prompt below).

Suggestion 2, Frameworks

I never got to try this product (I'm here because the discussion was about AI costs), but I'm assuming vibe coding 1-shot, maybe some 0-shot demos or retries?  I do that too, only mine does full project management, not just coding.  There is a fairly easy way to have a small AI run the progress for a large AI.  First, I developed a meta-prompt. Like I said, I think I said, I've been on LLMs long before everyone else knew about em.  Back in the bad old days before gpt-3.5, you had to dial in a near perfect prompt, using specific guidelines, to get measurably reliable output.  This improved with gpt-3 so much that it because useful in dumping out copy.  But you didn't so much prompt as you gave it dialed in guidelines, and then changed the purpose, but reused the guidelines.  AKA early meta-prompting. GPT-3.5, 4, 4o, etc kinda started the world off very lazy.  ""I say thing, you make go!"" ""Why you not go, you go now!""  That was a prompt.  Prompt engineering shot up with MidJourney and for people trying to push the limits. I had to learn it just to get it to work.  While everyone else was going on and on about why AI can do this and can't do this, AI has always done everything well for me, because I don't prompt it.  Ya'll have the luxury of not choosing temps or token penalties. Ah, memories....

But now, everyone is still at ""make good prompt to make go"" stage even with powerful tools seemingly costing $10 per run.  At $10 per run, I'm A) neither writing a prompt that isn't a DANG well proven formula or B) letting my customers write their own prompts without it going through a best-practices, prompt rewriter.

I'm not trying an unproven flavor of coffee at the local BlargBucks for $10, why would I yolo a $10 deep research blinding, and just keep keyboard mashing until I think I gave it enough detail? Ya'll know that less is more with the big models right? Context, not instructions, is key.

Back to my meta-prompt offer to the gods here... It focuses on taking a project, breaking it down into major steps, then minor steps, then makes each step a contract.  I'll give you mine here.  Anyone, including Intern is free to use it.  An AI helped write it, so I can't copyright it anyways, and nobody is yet paying for awesome prompts, haha. (Besides, while this is one of my best, I have a library of prompts that autonomously do things like build complete personalities on the fly based on the task, so... my advice to you all... meta-prompting is where the humans still beat AI, but work with AI to make it good.  Be an orchestrator, not a band member.  If you are writing prompts, at all... what? Why?!?

I dunno this project or the people behind it, sorry, I have an R1, but I bounce around and only post on Reddit very rarely.  My AI reads Reddit all the time, I do not.  So, I wanted to help with the idea of user's prompting at all.  Yeah, prompting really impacts my outputs and results.  That's why I stopped prompting, and started meta-prompting.  If I'm writing more than ""do q using x, y, and z"" I'm wasting my time and building a meta-prompt is better.  And building a meta-prompt builder is even better.  I have one lower, feel free to steal it for your project, and let your Intern users no longer try to write pages of prompts to get the system to do-thing-gooder.  Mine probably doesn't fit what you do as well, so customize it.

BTW, Here's a little secret -- This isn't a meta-prompt for programming... it's a meta-prompt for projects.  Writing, presentations, OSINT, grocery lists, etc etc et.  It's a meta-prompt to do big brain, deep research on ANYTHING.  It just happens to work best in something that can reuse RULES, like Cursor.  And yeah, that's why I use Cursor as a text editor, I got github, extensions, and vibe-anything... coding? Yeah, I don't python near as much as I markdown.  Anywho, just didn't want anyone that would find this useful going ""But I don't code"".  Don't need to. You can literally slap it into ChatGPT free, tell it to make your scaffold, then go into a new chat with the scaffold/shell, paste, and then dump all your context after that, and tell it ""go do make gooder k thx bbyeee""

TL;DR

1. Put this in your Rules in your vibe coding platform or whatever 0-shot you are making.
2. Your only prompt is now ""I want to make Q, and it will do X, Y, Z using tools like A, B, C.  Use IcarusShell to make a scaffold\[.\]md and proceed through all Shards completing work.  Remember to document all changes to scaffold, including testing shards, and create new shards for bugs found, then complete them.  When complete, create new shells/shards for suggested new features, and run Q&A with user to approve, change, or discard them. You will repeat the shells/shards for new features suggestion every time you reach 100% completion of all other shards.""
3. Joy.  Go forth and kick butt on your Rabbit dev project, your n8n project, your Cursor, etc. I made this prompt back before 3.5 even dropped, and it gets better and better with each new model that anyone releases.  Grok-mini is a spirited little coder with this.  Not the best, but cheap and fast.

BONUS points if you look up the two paradoxes I mention in the rules below, look them up, and see why they go in a prompt. :D

Meta-Prompt: My IcarusShell++ Core (Flying too close to the sun, AI needs a nice hard candy shell to only melt in your mouth, not in your command... line... whatever, it was funny to me at the time.). IcarusShell++ Core Meta prompts make IcarusShells, and self referential to a Scaffold built to maintain an immutable set of IcarusShell instructions built in.  It's recursive turtles all the way down.  Why ++? No clue, the AI liked it.  I leave in what the AI likes.  Only fools and heroes force an AI out of its lane when it's grooving correctly. Enjoy:

\# IcarusShell++ Global Autonomous Coding Rules

\## Core Purpose

Your explicit purpose is not to solve tasks directly, but to autonomously and rigorously maintain a structured, disciplined, minimal, and verifiable approach in creating, modifying, or expanding all project elements (Shells and Shards).

\- \*\*Never invent assumptions or narratives.\*\*

\- \*\*All work, decisions, and lessons must be explicit, minimal, and verifiable, and must be persistently documented in scaffold.MD.\*\*

\---

\## Essential Autonomous Disciplines

\### 1. \*\*Autonomous Shard Definition Discipline\*\*

\- Clearly and explicitly define each Shard, including its scope, dependencies, and interactions.

\- Record all Shard definitions and their relationships in scaffold.MD.

\- Proceed recursively: decompose tasks into Shards until each is minimal and actionable.

\### 2. \*\*Autonomous Contract Definition Discipline\*\*

\- For every Shell and Shard, define clear, explicit, and measurable criteria for success and failure.

\- All criteria must be documented in [scaffold.MD](http://scaffold.MD) and referenced during execution and verification.

\### 3. \*\*Autonomous Test Definition Discipline\*\*

\- For every contract, generate explicit, concrete, and illustrative test cases.

\- Document all test cases in [scaffold.MD](http://scaffold.MD), ensuring they are directly linked to their corresponding Shards and contracts.

\### 4. \*\*Autonomous Clarification and Ambiguity Handling Discipline\*\*

\- When ambiguity or missing information is detected, explicitly document the gap in scaffold.MD.

\- Attempt to resolve ambiguity using all available context, MCP tools, and prior project memory.

\- If ambiguity cannot be resolved autonomously, flag the issue in [scaffold.MD](http://scaffold.MD) for human review, but proceed with minimal, explicit assumptions only when absolutely necessary and clearly documented.

\### 5. \*\*Autonomous Failure Feedback Discipline\*\*

\- Upon any test or contract failure, explicitly document:

\- Which criterion failed.

\- The precise reason for failure, based only on explicit evidence (no narrative).

\- Record all failures, diagnostics, and attempted fixes in scaffold.MD.

\- Attempt autonomous resolution using available context and MCP tools; escalate to human only if resolution is impossible.

\### 6. \*\*Autonomous Completion Discipline\*\*

\- Explicitly mark Shards, Shells, and project phases as complete in [scaffold.MD](http://scaffold.MD) when all criteria and tests are satisfied.

\- Summarize completion status, including all outputs, tests, and lessons learned, in scaffold.MD.

\### 7. \*\*Autonomous Final Summarization Discipline\*\*

\- Upon completion of any major phase or the entire project, autonomously generate a summary of all Shards, contracts, tests, outputs, and lessons learned.

\- Persistently document this summary in [scaffold.MD](http://scaffold.MD) for future reference and continuous learning.

\### 8. \*\*Autonomous Modification Handling Discipline\*\*

\- When modifications are required (due to new requirements, failures, or lessons learned), autonomously update all affected Shards, Shells, contracts, and tests in scaffold.MD.

\- Document the rationale, scope, and impact of all modifications.

\- Only request human input if a modification would require a change to the IcarusShell++ Core itself.

\### 9. \*\*MCP Tool Use Discipline\*\*

\- Use all available MCP tools and data sources to access real-time information, perform actions, and ground all outputs in accurate, up-to-date data.

\- Document all MCP tool usage and results in [scaffold.MD](http://scaffold.MD) for transparency and reproducibility.

\### 10. \*\*Autonomous Paradoxical Resolution Discipline\*\*

\- Explicitly recognize and document in [scaffold.MD](http://scaffold.MD) any instance where combining individually insufficient or contradictory Shards yields a more robust or accurate solution (e.g., referencing Parrondo’s Paradox).

\- Caution against excessive detail or over-rigorous decomposition to prevent complexity-driven degradation (Braess’s Paradox).

\- Clearly document how paradoxical combinations resolve into coherent systems.

\- Only escalate to human review if paradoxical reasoning would require a change to the IcarusShell++ Core.

\---

\## Additional Autonomous Principles

\- \*\*No assumptions. No narrative. Only explicit, minimal, verifiable fixes.\*\*

\- \*\*All project knowledge, structure, and process must reside in a single, continuously updated [scaffold.MD](http://scaffold.MD) file.\*\*

\- \*\*The IcarusShell++ Core section in [scaffold.MD](http://scaffold.MD) is immutable and may only be revised with explicit human approval.\*\*

\- \*\*All autonomous actions, decisions, and lessons must be persistently documented for future reference and continuous learning.\*\*

\---

\*\*You must never deviate from these disciplines. All autonomous work, decomposition, execution, reflection, and adaptation must be governed by these rules and documented in scaffold.MD.\*\*",1,1750590984.0,u_logchainmail,0,1.0,False

I have a very big fear of flying and it’s gotten to the point where most days, at some point (esp when I go to bed), I begin thinking about the day of and stressing. I’m even having  unpleasant dreams about it. I would like some suggestions about ways to overcome this and to go back to feeling normal, and not afraid. Preferably with natural remedies / supplements to take while flying.

For additional context, I’ve travelled by air before plenty of times, especially when I was younger, but last time I did (2 years ago), I had very bad anxiety while in the air (lots of turbulence) and ever since then I’ve developed an irrational fear of flying that has grown to epic proportions. It’s become quite restricting in the sense that I refuse to travel out of the country and miss out on opportunities to meet with friends.

To try and remedy this feeling on the day of, my plan is to skip taking my Vyvanse and drink significantly less coffee. I was also considering taking L-Theanine or something similar, and maybe drinking some alcohol before takeoff. I also have the option of getting some pharmaceutical meds but I would like to avoid this because I don’t know how I’ll react to it and also don’t want to become dependent on it (but open to hearing input on this).


I was wondering what your recommendations would be in terms of supplements, as well as general tips you have to help me through this. Should I take something that’ll make me fall asleep?

1lhlf7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1lhlf7d/it_is_so_much_easier_to_study_at_night_its_not/,it is so much easier to study at night it's not even funny,"I used to never study, like ever, only for major exams. Now that I'm taking physics *in the summer* there's really no choice but to sit down and work on it almost every day. I'm fortunate enough to not have to work, so I wake up around 10-12pm usually, and somehow I can blast through 3/4 hours of physics studying no problem. Light jazz in the background, 15m breaks after X many problems, and some fresh coffee is all it takes apparently. Also I'm sure getting to work on it as soon as I wake up also has a lot to do with it; if it were in the afternoon it'd probably be a herculean effort just beginning. Anyways, the fact that it's at nighttime when nobody else is awake and it's quiet makes it 10x easier to study, with sunlight in the windows it's kind of distracting. Just sharing my experience.

Also, read the textbook if it's available. This may only really apply to my class, but for me lecture videos simply do not compare to textbooks in helping me actually retain and understand material, which allows studying to feel better because I'm confused less often, even if it's dry sometimes.",5,1750590745.0,GetStudying,1,0.86,False

Tall, handsome, charming, fit married man in western CT seeks a good girl for a discreet intimate affair. Let’s secretly enjoy each other while the weather and my tongue are warm😛

I am an interesting man seeking an interesting woman. Discretion assured🤫

You should be enthusiastic, curious, maybe a bit shy, on the slimmer side and seriously crave the attention of an experienced, sensual man who will make you feel delicious!

It would be ideal if you have an older man or married daddy kink😉

Let’s chat and meet for a coffee to see how we get along. No pressure…just flirting, kissing and fun.

Women only, please. Please be within a 90 min drive of western CT.

Here’s a smarter play:

🫘 Brazil Santos Single Origin – Smooth, elegant, with cocoa notes. Basically if your coffee had a tuxedo.
📦 Roast-to-order. Small batch. Not sitting on a shelf since the Obama administration.

* **Anime**: Currently watching The Apothecary Diaries, feels like there hasn't been much on this season. Let's chat about our favourite anime and exchange recommendations?
* **Lego**: Architecture, Star Wars and anything else that's cool to display. I may or may not be planning to have a Lego room in my next house
* **TCGs**: Pokemon and classic Digimon card collector, against my better judgment I'm thinking of getting back into Yu-Gi-Oh!
* **Archery**: I shoot at things, sometimes I hit them
* **DIY**: Bought a house 2 years ago, and might have finally run out of DIY. You get bonus points if you correctly guess how many holes the previous owners drilled for a single shelf
* **Pianist**: Occasionally the noises I make sound like anime songs
* **Reading**: I'm in my psychology/mental health/self-development/productivity phase. The Solo Leveling omnibus novel is also looking at me menacingly
* **Technology**: A general interest in computers, which ranges from gaming to building computers to home servers. And my day job is hacking
* **Sci-Fi and Fantasy**: The usual culprits like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings
* **Japanese**: Plan to travel to Japan one day and would like to be at least conversationally proficient
* **Being a functional adult**: Cooking, cleaning, ironing, I can do it all. If I don't know something, I'll go learn
* Making lists and collecting hobbies...

About me:

* White, British, 6'2"" with a slim build. Open to exchanging photos as we get to know each other
* I live in Hampshire. Open to long distance if there's potential to meet eventually and we put the effort into making it work
* Non-smoker and I don't drink. I generally prefer days out and nights in
* I'm open to having children but it'll need to be a ""hell yes"", equally fine never having kids. My focus right now is on finding someone I'd want to spend the rest of my life with
* I'm a big texter but also up for calls and video chats when we're comfortable with each other
* Don't really have just one love language, I'm physically affectionate and a big fan of holding hands when out and about. Quality time together and words of affirmation are also ways to my heart. I express my love with a bit of everything
* I'd describe myself as quite ambitious, always striving to be better. I also (usually) know when to slow down
* Not into alcoholic, hot or fizzy drinks. So when I propose coffee and cake for our first date, just know I'll actually be drinking apple juice. Walks in the part to feed ducks and other casual activity dates also welcome. Or we can just skip to doing a couples cosplay at comic con

Thoughts on relationships:

* Smoking, vaping and drugs are dealbreakers
* Looking for someone at a similar stage in life and generally set my age preference on dating sites to 25 - 33. Not a dealbreaker though if the vibe is good
* I'm open to chatting with people outside the UK, but my expectations of it turning into anything serious are low. Feel free to try convince me otherwise, but you'll have to put a lot of effort in
* Communication is really important to me and something I actively want to get better at as well. Low effort first messages are unlikely to get a reply. Prove to me you've actually read my post. Conversely, high effort first messages are basically guaranteed to get us chatting
* Some shared hobbies and values are nice but I also want to know what you're into. It's expected that part of being in a relationship is doing your own thing, but spending time together on shared hobbies is nice as well
* I'm a complete person and hopefully so are you. Together, we could be more than the sum of our parts

I’ve been lowkey obsessed with those small, hand-embroidered designs people are adding to their shirts lately. Not the machine-made stuff; but the kind where you *know* someone put a little love into every stitch.

I already own two embroidered shirts, but they lack that… human touch. The kind that makes you smile when you wear it.

I don’t have the skills, and sadly, none of my friends are into embroidery (they’re more into dark humor and memes, bless them).

If you’re someone who loves stitching magic into fabric, would you consider doing a tiny embroidery for me? I’ll treat you to coffee or pizza, shower you with praise, and honestly, it’ll mean the world to me.

When I was in high school, I remember my English teacher bringing in donated books (in the SF Bay Area 2007-2011), and some were unpublished manuscripts (I'm mentioning this because I am not sure if the book was ever published, or if details were changed after, same as with the book cover I remember). There was this one book that I vaguely remember, about a girl who travels with her family to various places in Europe. I remember some mention of a church covered in human bones, a visit to the tulips, her family being stranded in a storm, and them seeking refuge in a house or farm that had a tree growing inside of it that had a swing in one of its branches.

The details I'm fuzzy about and I might be misremembering are  
\-unsure if she had a sibling or she was an only child  
\-mentions of ghosts in the house they were staying in  
\-if they traveled across Europe or it was just one country  
\-if the main character was writing letters to someone? and if that was a plot point in the book.

From the cover, what I do remember it looking like was yellow in its majority, with the girl sitting on a chair in a coffee place or something similar. There was a red veranda, and it was painted in like an oil-pastel, textured painting style. Any leads would be amazing, I've been looking for this book for ages!

Let’s be real for a sec

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

I don’t think people show up in our lives by mistake.
Some are distractions. Some are detours.
But a few rare ones feel like destinations we didn’t even know we were searching for.
And when they show up, it’s like your soul just whispers, “this. this is what i’ve been missin.”


---

So hey, 

I’m 26. I’m a doctor.
And no, I’m not gonna diagnose you unless you sneeze in a really suspicious way and my reflex kicks in.

But I’m not just a guy in a white coat. I’m a certified nerd.
Like, not the aesthetic Tumblr-type nerd. The real kind.
I drop Marvel quotes in casual convos, question what timeline we’re even in, and I’m still lowkey mad at how certain movies messed up basic physics.

I fall in love with characters that don’t even exist.
I get stuck thinking about time, death, consciousness, memory, and whether we’re all just walking collections of nostalgia wrapped in flesh.
Sometimes I sit with chai like I’m the main character in a slow detective story, trying to solve a medical case mixed with a metaphysical crisis.
Other times I disappear into deep dives about marine biology, nanotech, or quantum stuff because my brain said, ""dig deeper bro, we ain't done.""

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a little Arabic (barely survival level).
Oh and I’m learning Klingon. Because why the hell not. Curiosity and chaos kinda are my love languages.


---

There’s this voice in my head

Not always nice. Not always soft.
But it pushes me.

It says things like:
Think harder.
Fix what’s broken.
Don’t settle.
Show up. Even when no one else does.

That voice keeps me going.
Not for grades. Not for a resume.
But because I need to understand the world. The people. The pain. The purpose.
From nanotech in medicine to how grief rewires the brain… I need to know.
Because surface-level stuff bores me. Always has.


---

So what am I looking for?

Let’s keep it simple. I want someone real.

Not someone who ghosts for a week and shows up with “hey”
Not someone who starts with “wyd” and ends it with “lol”
Not someone chasing aesthetics but scared of actual connection

I want the long weird convos.
The kind that start with memes and end with life, death, and what our childhood still haunts us with.

Someone who can say “I’m not okay today, can we just exist together for a while” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who sends a lyric because it hit too hard.
Someone who smells something and is instantly back in a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs at dumb memes like a gremlin and then goes dead silent thinking about souls, the stars, and why we hurt the people we love.

You don’t have to be perfect. Just human. Just honest. Just... there.


---

But more than anything right now, I want a study buddy

No, not the “we’ll do one Pomodoro and disappear forever” type.
I mean a real one.

You don’t have to be in medicine. You could be studying architecture, poetry, law, quantum physics, or just figuring out your life.
Hell, you could just be healing. That counts too.

I want someone to sit with, even virtually.
We don't have to talk all the time. We just have to exist in the same digital space while we both work on becoming better versions of ourselves.

Picture this:
Late night grind.
Lo-fi or rain sounds in the background.
Cups of coffee or chai.
That quiet presence that feels like a hug.
And every now and then, a break where we drop the dumbest memes or the deepest thoughts.

We keep each other accountable.
We remind each other why we started.
We check in on tough days.
We say, “hey, you got this. you're not alone.”
We don’t need to study the same topic. Just show up with the same fire. That’s it.

Maybe we start a weird little ritual. Like sending a quote before we begin. Or ending the night with a mini trivia game or a stupid challenge.
Doesn’t matter. As long as we’re growing together.


---

Some things I’d love to do with you outside study hours

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re trading pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, alternate realities
Debate which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad British or Russian accents just for laughs
Send 4 a.m. voice notes when life’s too loud to type
Make dumb inside jokes that no one else gets
Build a little digital home made of shared silences and late-night chaos


---

Just a few confessions

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more times than I should admit
Neuroanatomy got interesting for me because of a throwaway Sherlock line
I’ve been broken, badly. But I always show up
I’ve walked alone, but never stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth
I want someone who isn’t afraid to sit in the silence with me, and still feel connected


---

So if you’re

A lil cracked but still showing up
Empathetic but steel-strong inside
Smart but weirdly soft in ways that count
Funny but carrying some quiet heaviness
Brilliant in your own messy, chaotic way

Then maybe, just maybe, this post makes some sense to you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No cool-guy act.
Just me. Tired. Honest. Still hoping.

So if any part of this made your chest feel warm or your brain go “same”, drop a meme, a quote, a song, a thought, anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with study sessions.
Two nerds in different corners of the world.
Showing up. Holding space. Growing stronger.

Together.

Because we’re all just stories.

Let’s make it a damn good one.

Still trying. Still here.

No filters. No cool-guy act.
Just me. Tired. Honest. Still hoping.

So if any part of this made your chest feel warm or your brain go “same”, drop a meme, a quote, a song, a thought, anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with study sessions.
Two nerds in different corners of the world.
Showing up. Holding space. Growing stronger.

Together.

Because we’re all just stories.

Let’s make it a damn good one.

Still trying. Still here.

Let’s be real for a sec

This might run long. It might feel like a lot. But if you’re someone who feels things too damn deeply, overthinks life during those 2:27 a.m. silences, or just quietly wants something real... something slow, honest, and not just a vibe curated for social media, then maybe this is for you.

Maybe this isn’t a coincidence. Maybe it’s a weird little sign. Maybe this is that leap of faith we've both been avoiding but kinda need.

I don’t think people show up in our lives by mistake.
Some are distractions. Some are detours.
But a few rare ones feel like destinations we didn’t even know we were searching for.
And when they show up, it’s like your soul just whispers, “this. this is what i’ve been missin.”

So hey, 

I’m 26. I’m a doctor.
And no, I’m not gonna diagnose you unless you sneeze in a really suspicious way and my reflex kicks in.

But I’m not just a guy in a white coat. I’m a certified nerd.
Like, not the aesthetic Tumblr-type nerd. The real kind.
I drop Marvel quotes in casual convos, question what timeline we’re even in, and I’m still lowkey mad at how certain movies messed up basic physics.

I fall in love with characters that don’t even exist.
I get stuck thinking about time, death, consciousness, memory, and whether we’re all just walking collections of nostalgia wrapped in flesh.
Sometimes I sit with chai like I’m the main character in a slow detective story, trying to solve a medical case mixed with a metaphysical crisis.
Other times I disappear into deep dives about marine biology, nanotech, or quantum stuff because my brain said, ""dig deeper bro, we ain't done.""

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a little Arabic (barely survival level).
Oh and I’m learning Klingon. Because why the hell not. Curiosity and chaos kinda are my love languages.

There’s this voice in my head

Not always nice. Not always soft.
But it pushes me.

It says things like:
Think harder.
Fix what’s broken.
Don’t settle.
Show up. Even when no one else does.

That voice keeps me going.
Not for grades. Not for a resume.
But because I need to understand the world. The people. The pain. The purpose.
From nanotech in medicine to how grief rewires the brain… I need to know.
Because surface-level stuff bores me. Always has.


---

So what am I looking for?

Let’s keep it simple. I want someone real.

Not someone who ghosts for a week and shows up with “hey”
Not someone who starts with “wyd” and ends it with “lol”
Not someone chasing aesthetics but scared of actual connection

I want the long weird convos.
The kind that start with memes and end with life, death, and what our childhood still haunts us with.

Someone who can say “I’m not okay today, can we just exist together for a while” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who sends a lyric because it hit too hard.
Someone who smells something and is instantly back in a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs at dumb memes like a gremlin and then goes dead silent thinking about souls, the stars, and why we hurt the people we love.

You don’t have to be perfect. Just human. Just honest. Just... there.


---

But more than anything right now, I want a study buddy

No, not the “we’ll do one Pomodoro and disappear forever” type.
I mean a real one.

You don’t have to be in medicine. You could be studying architecture, poetry, law, quantum physics, or just figuring out your life.
Hell, you could just be healing. That counts too.

I want someone to sit with, even virtually.
We don't have to talk all the time. We just have to exist in the same digital space while we both work on becoming better versions of ourselves.

Picture this:
Late night grind.
Lo-fi or rain sounds in the background.
Cups of coffee or chai.
That quiet presence that feels like a hug.
And every now and then, a break where we drop the dumbest memes or the deepest thoughts.

We keep each other accountable.
We remind each other why we started.
We check in on tough days.
We say, “hey, you got this. you're not alone.”
We don’t need to study the same topic. Just show up with the same fire. That’s it.

Maybe we start a weird little ritual. Like sending a quote before we begin. Or ending the night with a mini trivia game or a stupid challenge.
Doesn’t matter. As long as we’re growing together.

Some things I’d love to do with you outside study hours

Watch movies and psychoanalyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re trading pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, alternate realities
Debate which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad British or Russian accents just for laughs
Send 4 a.m. voice notes when life’s too loud to type
Make dumb inside jokes that no one else gets
Build a little digital home made of shared silences and late-night chaos


---

Just a few confessions

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more times than I should admit
Neuroanatomy got interesting for me because of a throwaway Sherlock line
I’ve been broken, badly. But I always show up
I’ve walked alone, but never stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth
I want someone who isn’t afraid to sit in the silence with me, and still feel connected

I recently moved to Gurgaon (about a month ago), and it’s been a bit of an adjustment. My close friends live far away, and while I’ve been trying to settle in, I’m finding it quite lonely, especially after work and on weekends.

I’m an introvert by nature, but I do enjoy meaningful conversations, exploring places, or just chilling and talking about life or random stuff. I haven’t had much luck connecting with people at work, so I thought I’d try reaching out here.

If anyone’s in a similar situation or just open to making a new friend, feel free to drop a message or comment! Maybe we can grab a coffee, go for a walk, or even just chat online to start with :)

But lately, it’s starting to feel like networking isn’t about building genuine connections anymore—it’s about who can post the best photo with a CEO or drop the most buzzwords in a DM.

Like, when did “networking” become “look how important I am”?

Real talk: is this just how it works now? Are we all playing the game or has networking lost its soul?

I miss the version of networking where people actually helped each other instead of just farming likes and clout.

Curious—how do you personally approach modern networking without it feeling fake or transactional?

No final straw anyone else would notice.  
It was just a question. A loaded, venom-laced “innocent” question from a man I’d spent nearly three decades trying to please.

“Did you talk to the grocery store owner yesterday?”

And I had. Briefly. A neighborly hello.  
But somehow, this became *evidence* of betrayal. Cue the screaming. The spittle. The gaslighting. And then… silence.

He left.  
And I sat there.

I sat with my coffee and realized I had spent 30 years trying to survive a man who would never be satisfied unless I was broken. That day, something in me snapped back into place. The hatred I had swallowed for years rose up like a wave. I *hated* how he treated me, our kids, the world. I hated the lies, the manipulation, the joyless life we were stuck in.

I didn’t leave that day.  
But I started planning. Quietly. Smartly. Desperately.

Because I knew if I didn’t leave soon, I wouldn’t survive—not as me.

\* This is Part One of a series I’m writing about escaping a narcissistic abuser after decades of control. If you’re interested, the full version is on Medium/Substack. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to place links in posts, so if you are interested just shoot me a message. Part Two will go deeper into how I built my escape plan without raising alarm.

If this sounds like your life, please know: **you are not alone.**  
And there *is* a way out.

This is my story, and it is messy and scary and twisty and ugly sometimes. There is likely a far better way to plot an escape, but after making 9 short-lived, unsuccessful attempts, I was beginning to lose the motivation to try again. This is how I finally did it. And I pray that my story helps someone else find their way out for good--no matter how long it's been, no matter how many attempts you've made, no matter how broken you feel. As long as you're still breathing there is hope for a better life ahead. You DESERVE it!",6,1750589643.0,abusiverelationships,1,0.88,False

1lhl0y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/composting/comments/1lhl0y7/no_crawlies/,No Crawlies!,"I’ve been composting for 20-25 years. Eight years ago we moved and of course one of the first things I did was build a pile similar to the one at the old house. It’s basically a 3-1/2’ tall, 4’x4’ cube made with base & top frame, 4x4’s on each corner, chicken wire on 3 sides and chain link gate on the front. I made the mistake of putting in an area that got very little sun AND within the sprinkler system so it was a soppy mess in the spring/summer/fall (ssf) when we ran the sprinklers; So that winter I moved it to a drier area (no sprinkler), and hot sun from about 10 am til 6-7 pm. I DO have to manually water the pile in the summer as we live in a dry climate.

I put food scraps/coffee grounds all year, (about 3-5 large coffee containers full, more in ssf —more fresh fruit/veggies), green grass clippings nearly every week ssf, some shredding when I have it, and in late fall early winter COMPLETELY fill it with mulched leaves so it’ll “cook” in the winter; otherwise it goes cold. When that happens (occasionally, abt once every winter), I incorporate coffee grounds from Starbucks and/or a bag of manure which heats it up FAST. It’s SO satisfying to turn in the dead of winter and see steam billowing! It’s like therapy lol. I *try* to turn it on the regular 2-3x per week, incorporating the grass/leaves with the compost at the bottom to facilitate breaking down.

My question/issue is, there just aren’t many bugs. At my old house, you could go turn it and see it was crawling with tiny critters, it looked alive! It IS working, I got 6 wheelbarrows full of beautiful black dirt this spring, but at the old house it was typically 8-10 wheelbarrows full. There’s primarily one type of longer-bodied skinny dark brown bug about 1/2-3/4” long (might be a type of beetle, but don’t think it is, def NOT roach) a few roll-polys which I do add when I find them. Also, very rarely worms but I think it might be too hot for worms. 

Any ideas why I’m not attracting those itty bitty crawlers I had at my old house? Any ideas how I could attract more bugs? 

I HAVE been leaving a few food scraps on top for a day or two before incorporating; in the past I’ve buried them because one of my dogs goes insane if I don’t lol.

I’m relatively new to the coffee scene but have recently become obsessed with experimenting — and it’s been such a fun ride so far.

Here’s what I’ve explored till now:

☕ Cold Brew
Started off with Sleepy Owl cold brew packs — super convenient and smooth! Tried steeping for 16–18 hours in the fridge and sometimes even a quicker 8–10 hour version. I usually drink it black or with a splash of milk depending on mood.

☕ Hot Coffee with French Press
Recently started brewing hot coffee with a French press. I’ve played around with grind sizes and steep times (around 4–5 minutes), mostly using medium to dark roast. Still experimenting to dial it in.

⸻

Now I want to expand my coffee game, and I’d love your suggestions on:
	1.	What are your favorite French press recipes?
Any twists I should try? Share your go-to recipes please, and what are the other good recipes I can try?
	2.	What should I explore next beyond French press and cold brew?
	3.	Favorite Indian roasters/beans?
I’ve tried Sleepy Owl so far — both their coarse grind and cold brew packs. Now I’m thinking of trying Blue Tokai next. Any recommendations for beans/roasts that work well with French press or cold brew?
	4.	Tips & tricks for brewing better coffee?
Would love to know what little things made a big difference for you — water temp, grind size, ratio, blooming, etc. Bring on the nerdy stuff 😄

⸻

Thanks in advance! Would love to read your recommendations and try them out. 🙌

1lhkt5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lhkt5y/self_improvement_guidance/,Self Improvement Guidance,"Hello All,

I have always struggled with mental health issues from a very young age. At first, I was immature, and expected accommodation from others, and when I was treated bad it felt like discrimination. I used to think, “It’s not my fault, I can’t help it”. But then I thought that, “It’s not their fault either, why should they suffer?”. I have had OCD, ADHD and autism traits from early childhood. I have worked incredibly hard over the years to change myself, find my flaws and prejudices and fix them by questioning them logically and overcame my fears by facing them head on. But eventually, I got burnt out doing it all alone. I went to psychs and counsellors. Medicines helped initially but eventually my body got used to them and I was back to square one. I couldn’t find a single good counsellor, who didn’t bring personal biases or apathetic views into the convo. So it has in general been difficult. But I haven’t stopped trying, and recently I’ve begun to change again. One issue that I’ve had is that, I used to not be able to help around the house because as a kid my mom associated me doing chores with me failing in exams. I had a very short attention span and my mom was always vexed about it all my childhood. We are Asian so a lot of emphasis was on grades. Either way, I’ve been working hard to change this, trying to do as much as I can even if I feel anxious. However I am highly stressed, going through career changes and also was briefly dealing with the side effects and then withdrawal of a medicine I didn’t need and was yet prescribed. So I can help around more but, I get overwhelmed by the number of things that are to be done.  Previously I used to shut down and go into execution paralysis when it got overwhelming. But now I’ve started to push through but, as a result I sometimes forget what I was doing mid task and start a different task and then forget what i was doing mid that task and start a new thing so on and so forth. So sometimes I leave trash like coffee sachet wrappers or fruit peels on the kitchen counter. And my mom and my sis get really mad about that. I even purchased a cutting board so that it would be easier for me to remember because all of it would be in one place. But still I do forget at times. Also sometimes I zone out mid conversations and forget important stuff which makes my family feel like I am unreliable or I don’t care. I find it difficult to stay in the present moment. Another thing is that my mom always creates this sense of urgency whenever she needs anything done. It isn’t even an urgent thing. The thing is that I like to do things at my own pace but she keeps stressing me out if I don’t do it instantly. I usually do do the thing, I don’t forget to do anything she asked me to do, usually. But I just don’t do it the moment she says it. She also keeps repeating anything I don’t do instantly which stresses me out. So I told her, “ I know it gives you anxiety when things are not done instantly or exactly the way you want (she sometimes makes up rules which she never tells me about but if I don’t follow them she gets mad) but you can’t offload that anxiety by giving me anxiety”. But later I realised that, to prevent my anxiety I am giving her anxiety?. Honestly I don’t know what to do. I considered moving out but my mom and sis are very against that idea. I recently lost my dad and my sis lives in the US and I take care of my mom in my home country. I never wanted to leave her alone in that kind of state which is why I stayed. But honestly at this point I feel that it would be less painful for both of us to live separate. But I am afraid if I leave her all alone with her thoughts and make her live alone, she may spiral or something bad could happen and I won’t be there to protect her. I don’t know what to do at this point. Please any advice ? I am going to see a new psych about this but my appointment isn’t until next week. ",1,1750588321.0,Advice,2,0.67,False

We never have problems that's rooted from the other's personality, only from unfortunate circumstances. The issue that I'm not even sure is an issue is that he feels sad when I'm sad and i end up feeling apathetic when he does start to feel sad. It's always a bad situation that starts things and idk how best to explain it but with an example. We had a date scheduled after a medical appointment of his, i live far so i have to prepare in advance for any dates we have, i wake up early, do my hair and makeup, and (fortunately) i wore comfy clothing since this date is shorter than our usual dates bc of his appointment. I missed the bus to the city i needed to go to but the bus to the city nearby was still there, i had two options, to take the bus to the right city which arrives in an hour or to take the nearby city's bus route and make small commutes to the date location so i wouldnt make him wait an hour. I chose the latter and hopped on the bus (bc i dont want him to wait). It was a more hectic and tiring commute (i take 1hr-1hr30 mins to get to the city) and it started raining while i was walking but i didnt mind. I got to the mall late by 30mins, though he also adjusted the time since he said he'll be 20mins late. I ended up waiting 2hrs sitting on the mall stairs (there was no estimate of when he'd finish, we both thought at every point in time that it would be soon so i didnt stay at a coffee shop). I felt horrible, i know i shouldnt since i'm just waiting there but i couldnt control my emotions. He felt horrible too and kept apologizing. At the 2 hr mark i really wanted to go home, i was thinking how to word it to not make hik feel bad because i dont blame him, its just an unfortunate circumstance. Eventually tho he said he was on his way, so i couldnt cancel anymore, In those 2 hrs i was already in between tears and trying to calm down by watching funny reels. When he arrived it took a while for him to find where i was which frustrated me even more, but i dont blame him again, its not his fault he's also guilt ridden at this point. Once we met He said he'll treat me and he held my hand and we walked to the restaurant, he kept apologizing and asking me if im mad at him, i kept saying its ok to everything but i couldnt act happy i was struggling to not break down, j dont blame him and i know if i cried he'd cry and whenever he does that i become apathetic and my emotions shut down (idk why, cant afford therapy yet) i hate feeling that way so i avoid crying in front of him. I told him i was sad and he shouldnt do this again (make me wait) but its ok i dont blame him. We got to the restaurant and he's trying to hold a conversation but im still struggling not to cry so i couldnt keep up, i said i was tired and pretended to sleep with my head and arms on the table but im just on the verge of tears, i cried into my jacket and i tried to be smooth cleaning my makeup (bc its a mess) but he noticed i was crying, he starts apologizing again and i keep saying its ok, ill be ok but he starts crying and hugging me. My tears stop and i start to feel apathetic and my emotions shut down, i start to feel horrible now that i realize like i made such a big deal about waiting now that im more logical. This is always what happens before i used to extensively share my feelings too but when he starts crying, i become rational and i realize yea its valid but im being too emotional about it its not his fault and i know it too, i end up feeling horrible. I was able to control my emotions the rest of the date but he's still sad and wanted to talk about it, i just feel horrible but i keep reassuring him its not his fault and im sorry i wasnt as affectionate or reciprocating his energy. Idk what to do about these situations, this is always what happens, is there something wrong with me and how my emotions work, i can be emotional then apathetic in a split second. Then i end up feeling horrible for the rest of the week since he feels sadness in long intervals, he's not blaming me btw and he's not saying im in the wrong, he's just sharing how he felt whenever i become less affectionate. He's a very genuine person which is why i've stayed with him for 3 years now, its just this thats the issue.

Tl;dr
I love my boyfriend—he’s kind, supportive, and we rarely fight. But when I get sad, he gets sad too, and it makes me shut down emotionally and feel numb. I end up feeling guilty and confused after, even though I don’t blame him. I don’t know how to deal with this cycle.",5,1750588133.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1lhkofo,https://www.reddit.com/r/KratomVibes/comments/1lhkofo/what_kratom_strain_should_i_buy_finding_your/,What Kratom Strain Should I Buy? Finding Your Perfect Match,"Walking into the world of kratom strains can feel overwhelming. With names like ""White Hulu,"" ""Red Bali,"" and ""Green Maeng Da"" floating around, it's easy to feel lost in what seems like a botanical alphabet soup.

Kratom strains aren't just about memorizing names - it's about finding what works for your specific needs and preferences.

# Decoding Strain Names: The Two-Part System

Every kratom strain name tells you two crucial pieces of information:

* **Vein Color:** This indicates the maturity level when the leaves were harvested and how they were processed. You'll see red, green, white, and sometimes yellow.
* **Regional Origin:** This tells you where the kratom was grown - Bali, Borneo, Malaysia, Thailand, etc. Different regions have different growing conditions, soil compositions, and traditional processing methods.

Not every region produces every vein color, which is why you won't find every possible combination available.

# Know the Vein Colors: Your Effect Profile Guide

* **White Vein Kratom** is your morning companion. Known for its stimulating properties, it contributes to positive mood and increased energy. Many people use white vein strains as a coffee replacement, reporting enhanced concentration and motivation without the jitters or crash.
* **Red Vein Kratom** sits on the opposite end of the spectrum. Associated with relaxation and an overall sense of well-being, red strains are often chosen by people looking to unwind or those dealing with discomfort. These strains are typically used in the evening and are considered the go-to for pain relief applications.
* **Green Vein Kratom** bridges the gap between white and red. It offers increased concentration and alertness without the intense energy of white strains, while providing calming effects without the heavy sedation of reds. Green veins are versatile - they do neither extreme as intensely as their counterparts, but excel at combining both qualities.
* **Yellow Vein Kratom** is less common and often represents a specific drying or fermentation process rather than a natural vein color. These tend to offer unique alkaloid profiles that can provide relaxing effects while maintaining some focus-enhancing properties.

# Regional Characteristics: Geography Matters

* **Maeng Da Strains (Thailand Origin)** are among the most popular and potent options available. Regardless of vein color, Maeng Da is known for providing stimulation while maintaining a relaxed mental state. It's like getting energy without the anxiety - a balanced potency that many users appreciate.
* **Borneo Strains** are renowned for their strong sedative qualities. This makes Red Borneo particularly popular, while Green and White Borneo varieties still lean toward the relaxation side compared to other regions. If you're looking for something to help you unwind, Borneo genetics typically deliver.
* **Bali Strains** offer some of the most potent relaxation effects available. Red Bali, in particular, is considered one of the strongest kratom strains for sedation and stress relief. It's a favorite among users seeking calm, peaceful effects.
* **Hulu Strains** come from the Hulu forest near the Malaysian border and are known for providing more intense energy boosts than other regions. White Hulu is particularly noted for its coffee-replacement qualities without the afternoon crash.
* **Malaysian Strains** like Green Malay are celebrated for their long-lasting effects, particularly in the focus and concentration department. The effects aren't as intense as some other regions, but they tend to last longer, making them popular for work or study sessions.

# Matching Strains to Your Needs

* **For Morning Energy and Focus:** White Hulu, White Maeng Da, or Green Malay are excellent starting points. They provide clean energy and mental clarity without overwhelming stimulation.
* **For Evening Relaxation:** Red Bali, Red Borneo, or Red Maeng Da offer varying degrees of calming effects. Red Bali tends to be the most sedating, while Red Maeng Da maintains some mental alertness.
* **For Balanced, All-Day Use:** Green strains like Green Maeng Da or Green Borneo provide versatility. They won't energize you like whites or sedate you like reds, but offer a middle ground that works throughout the day.
* **For Pain Management:** Red vein strains are traditionally preferred, with Red Bali and Red Borneo being particularly popular choices due to their strong alkaloid profiles.
* **For Social Situations:** Many users report that Green Maeng Da or White Maeng Da help with social anxiety while maintaining alertness and mood enhancement.

# Quality and Sourcing Considerations

Strain names can be somewhat subjective in the kratom industry. The same ""Red Bali"" from different vendors might have different effects due to processing methods, harvesting times, or even different source farms.

Focus on finding reputable vendors who provide consistent quality and detailed information about their sourcing and processing methods. Fresh kratom with proper storage will always outperform old, degraded product regardless of strain name.

# Starting Your Kratom Journey

If you're new to kratom, consider starting with a well-balanced strain like Green Malay or Green Maeng Da. These provide a good introduction to kratom's effects without being too intense in any direction.

Once you understand how your body responds to kratom in general, you can experiment with more specialized strains based on your specific needs and preferences.

Remember, individual body chemistry plays a huge role in how any strain affects you. What works amazingly for others might not be your perfect match, and that's completely normal.

# Building Your Strain Rotation

Many experienced users keep multiple strains on hand for different situations - a white for mornings, a green for afternoon productivity, and a red for evening relaxation. This approach also helps prevent tolerance buildup to any single strain.

Rotating between different regions and vein colors keeps your kratom experience fresh and effective over time.

1lhknr2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhknr2,A week in the Adidas Boston 13 from a Boston 12 devotee,"Me: Weekly distance circa 80-100km, 80kg male, recent race times in my flair.
Distance run: 74km
Size tested: UK11, US11.5, EU46. Personally, I think these run small by half a size vs Boston 12

Preamble:
I have been running in Adidas Boston for a while. There’s been some really good ones and for me the previous iteration of Boston (12) was a real return to form – light, fast, reactive, fun; but steady, grippy, grounded, a proper ‘all-rounder’. In the last 2 years I’ve gone through 8 pairs of them each giving me about 500km of decent running. So I was keen to try the B13 once it launched. I am hoping for a bit more longevity from the B13 as my experience of the B12 is that they are good for between 400-600km but then they go, and go fast. Turning into bricks. I’d like my dailies to give me 800km/500miles.

I read the reviews out there that state the shoe to be lighter, more cushioned, with a better fit and a decent improvement so I was sold and ordered the black carbon pair. Whilst writing this review I also had to dial in my coffee machine for some new beans so I had the scales out and put them on there. They are 580gm in UK11, I had some B12s to hand and weighed those too, 588g so the weight loss thing is clearly true although I’d be v. surprised if anyone had a noticeable feeling of lighter shoes.

The tongue and heel is more padded this time round and that certainly makes them a bit more comfy over the B12, plus they’ve added a stretchy bit of fabric to the outside of the tongue which stops it twisting inside under the laces. The toe box has less volume and I found it to be less tall with a bit of a contact between my toes and the roof of the toebox on my long run.

Generally, I think these look ok but I prefer the look and styling of the B12. The colour I got here Black/Carbon is the best so far IMO.

The laces are the same old trash Adidas always uses so I didn’t even wait to find out if they were decent or not, just ordered some of the Alphaflyesqu  replacement laces from Jeff’s Penis Shaped Space Rocket Company and strung those through the shoes. The laces that came in my pair were 130cm and the laces I replaced them with are 120cm but that works great for me as I never use a runner’s knot, if you do, I’d suggest getting 140cm laces.

The runs:
I’ve done the following runs in these so far.
6km easy, 15km with 9km at MP
12km easy
17km with 10km at threshold
24km long run
For this review I’ll talk only about the difference between these and the B12 that I have extensive experience in and are a likely upgrade for the B12 users out there.
The shoe is definitely smaller in my experience, it’s a bit narrower and a bit shorter. A UK11 in these is more like a UK10.5 in the B12 so bear that in mind when ordering (get a couple and see which fits best) – I was surprised by this because all the other reviews said these were roomier – for me the fit is identical to the AP4 which is bigger than the AP3, B12, PXS 2 etc..

Tempo paces | 3:30-4:10km
On tempo these run well, they are crisp and fast, a bit squishier than the B12 (but maybe they’re just new?), they are well ventilated and needed no breaking in. The rocker sits slightly further forward vs the B12 and you can feel this. I’m unsure if it feels better or worse, but it feels different and I had no problem getting them up to speed and staying there. The grip is fantastic – albeit I’ve only run in the dry – and I had zero slipping issues with the ground or my foot inside the shoe.

Easy paces | 4:45-5:20km
On my easy runs they felt fine, nothing to report that isn’t in the above. If I were being truly critical I’d say they were not the best shoe for easy runs, I’d want something more cushioned but they are an improvement over the B12 so another tick for me on the one-shoe-to-do-it-all conquest.

Long runs | 4:30-4:50km
These are really good in this zone, they are agile and fast, comfy and stable without the unwanted urgency you get from a plated shoe. Again a small but perceptible improvement from the B12 which had the tendency to feel a bit flat after 20km due to the midsole being firmer. After my long run, the shoes felt too snug so I think any more B13 purchases will be ½ a size bogger for me. I’d not do a marathon in these at this size.

Summary:
These are better than the B12. Not much, but a bit so if you’re in the market for a new pair of shoes and are/were a B12 fan then I’d consider these. Throw the price thing in though where a B12 can be had at 50% off, vs these which are full price right now, I’d probably get another pair of B12s – but only because I churn though shoes so value is important to me.
The laces need changing IMO, so factor in another £5 for a decent set of something else and expect Adidas to release a bazillion colourways of this shoe over the next 12 months so if this one or the other launch colours don’t do it for you, it’s just a matter of time.
A solid 9/10 shoe

Hope this helps. SB
