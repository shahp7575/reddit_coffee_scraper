*December 8, 2025*

I love my husband. We have been together 9 years, married for 6 and have been through a lot together. He has never given me a single reason to think he would stray from our relationship physically or emotionally. He is an amazing father, and very equally shares the household load. We have our ups and downs like most people but generally we are solid and always come back to each other after a disagreement.

Now to the issue. He recently embarked on his Masters degree. He is one of only 2 men in his cohort of approx 80 people, and the only guy of our culture (we are in our home country, the course and university is just incredibly multicultured)

As such, he has made a lot of new female friends, most of whom dont bother me at all. But theres this one (30f I think) that I just dont like his friendship with and I know I'm being unreasonable.

They text all the time, like multiple times a day - mind you he isnt secretive about this. He doesn't hide his phone or anything like that. I can see her name at the top of his screen. He also talks ABOUT her all the time. How nice she is, and all the cool things she's done. He also spends a LOT of time with her - they have just decided to collaborate on a research project together for a conference in 2026 and as such they will likely be spending even more time together.

Frankly I'm sick of hearing about how nice and amazing this other woman is. Shes also annoyed the hell out of him at times, blowing like hot and cold at him when she has perceived he has done something wrong (though its probably cultural differences that trigger this) - and he'll talk about this too. It's like watching someone discuss the beginnings of a relationship, the euphoria of dating someone new, plus all the baggage they come with as they work through it, which is a weird thing to watch your husband go through.

I dont believe its anything more than I have described above. When I said I didn't think it was appropriate for him to be messaging her as frequently as he is (and if the shoe was on the other foot, does he really think he would be okay with me messaging a man as frequently) and he offered to let me read all their messages (which I didn't) So I really dont think he's hiding anything. I obviously dont want him to start being secretive about it so I've said I'll drop it. But I just feel annoyed and jealous like every time I see her name pop up on his phone.

I dont even think he's physically attracted to her, we have a great sex life and this is not something I feel insecure about. I guess she's shiny and new and interesting and they have a lot in common, I think I'm insecure about not being interesting enough for him and maybe sometimes feel like he'd rather talk to her than me.

I'm not used to him having female friends (though he used to have many when he was younger) and I'm finding this new dynamic really difficult.

Any advice as to how I can just get over it and accept this new friendship as it is?

># Notable comments:

It sounds to me like your fear is that she is becoming emotionally stimulating in a way you’re not. So the solution is not to restrict him from being her friend, it’s to reignite the spark in your marriage. You don’t need to go into competition with her but your feelings warrant a deeper discussion with him about your emotional experience and what will help you feel secure. In the end of the day, time spent with a friend (texting, phone calls, in-person) shouldn’t exceed time invested your the relationship.

If you’re not already doing this start dating again, sometimes we get stuck in our daily routines so initiate experiences together like trying a new restaurant, class, trip, hobby. Carve out intentional connection time where you’re not discussing logistics or children. Create rituals like weekly check-ins, Friday night wine and music at home or out, Sunday morning coffee walks together or with the kids. If he ever becomes resistant to this in favor of spending time with her or he’s constantly distracted by her during “your” time, then I’d start to worry.

It doesn’t sound like your marriage is threatened at this point especially if he’s being transparent as there’s still affection between you. But the relationship could benefit from infusing some fresh energy, since he’s getting a ton from school. [gdrom123](https://www.reddit.com/user/gdrom123)
> This is really good advice thank you. We have tried to do a bit more ""dating"" in recent months as we both acknowledge how its easy to just sort of forget one another with how busy we both are and kids etc. Trying to make it more of a regular thing probably is in order though. We do have a going out date booked in in a couple of weeks (babysitter and everything lol) and we actually went out during the day a couple of weeks ago as well. So it is there but could definitely be more frequent. Thanks again! **[OOP]**

You’re already getting some “advice” here from some of the most chronically insecure people on the internet, so let’s take the other view for a second.

If he was trying to replace you emotionally or physically, or be inappropriate in any other way, he simply wouldn’t be so transparent about it.

It sounds like he’s trying to engage you because he’s excited about a new friendship and wants you to be ok with this.

This doesn’t mean you stop looking out for the warning signs, but it means you look at what’s really worrying you about this, and what you can do about it.

It sounds like what you’re worried about is that there’s greener grass out there for him to find.

Whenever this is your worry, the first solution is to water your own grass. Remind yourself of all the reasons you’re his choice. He hasn’t forgotten- don’t let yourself forget.

Be secure in what you bring. [Lambsenglish](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ph6c0v/how_do_i_31f_stop_being_so_jealous_regarding_my/nswpbir/)
> Thank you, this is the most reasonable advice here I think. ""Water your own grass"" is definitely what I needed to hear in this situation. And I agree, I dont think he'd be so transparent if he was doing anything wrong! **[OOP]**

># Comment by OOP:

This is another part to it, neither of us really has many friends either. He had loads of friends growing up but he has his first child quite young and has subsequently grown apart from most of those friends. He also said that all his pre-exiating friends ever ask him about is the kids and he's enjoying having people he can talk about other things with.

That's probably also part of my jealousy to be honest because I am also very much lacking in the friend department! **[OOP]**

*December 31, 2025, 23 days later*

This is not going to be a long update and will probably not be that exciting/interesting but some people wanted an update from my last post.

My husband and I discussed his new friend a few times and he understood where I was coming from but was a bit hurt because he's never done anything in our relationship to suggest he might ever be unfaithful. I believed him when we talked about it but he thought it would be better if I could just meet her to try and understand a bit better and I agreed.

We had a few friends over for his birthday last night and she came. The birthday gift she got him was a picture of my whole family (me, hubs, and the kids and even the dog) that she'd made herself (digital - she's a bit of a graphic designer) on a light box. It's really beautiful and I think its a lovely present because it includes me and the kids. She was incredibly respectful all night, and we actually have a fair amount in common with some shared interests and shared experiences (e.g. we have both been scuba diving and are interested in marine conservation). She just seems genuinely very nice, not fake at all and her being around felt very akin to my husbands other female friend that we had over as well. All that to say, I'm no longer concerned about anything dodgy developing between her and my husband and I certainly dont think anything untoward has happened as yet. Oh also, I caught a glimpse of their messages this morning and she was messaging him about how nice I seemed, and he was talking about how cool I am - that wasn't performative because he didn't tell me about it. It was just part of the conversation they were having. The rest of which was about the Japanese curry my husband made last night 🤷🏼‍♀️ idk I'm sure reddit will tell me im being stupid or naive but it just feels very innocent now I've actually met her.

Aside from this my husband and I have had other arguments about other issues in our relationship and have agreed on one at home date night per week where we do something fun together but also like get a bit dressed up and like make an effort for each other (instead of only making and effort when we go out or go to the office or whatever). We're also working on each of our individul mental health and wellbeing as well (eating better, exercising more, allowing each other ""me time"" away from the kids in a more consistent way). Some of the advice I got on my last post was about making more of an effort in our relationship and ""watering my own garden"" as well so I feel like we are addressing that.

I'm hopeful we can do this well and 2026 will be a better year for us. We love each other very much, and our family so we're going to improve our communication and work on ourselves and our relationship as best we can :)

Thanks for all the people who gave reasonable advice on my last post - there was more than I was expecting!

I am so curious about the amount of posts I see where itineraries list already-chosen places to eat/have coffee etc, presumably places people have seen recommended in guidebooks, social media, on here etc. 

I’m someone who sometimes likes to prebook - to save hassle and to guarantee table time etc especially with a group- but I also like, especially on holiday, to saunter about and stumble on nice looking places that I can discover by myself eg a coffee shop or lunch place that just looks nice, a lucky find. 

So I suppose my question is, do people like to still do this - and when going to a list of pre booked ‘must do’ places, what’s it really like - is there ever a sense of “ok, here we are, seated in this go-to place, but perhaps we feel a bit like we had to go here as it was on a list and actually it’s not what we felt like right now” ie - an anti climax?

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/RvrhhyD00M

Hey guys, it's been about a month since my post where I vented about my wife nagging at me over my Old School RuneScape 'addiction'.

A lot has happened since then and I figured I'd drop an update for anyone who remembers and for those that messaged me. Thanks to everyone who commented back then btw. Some of you were spot on about reevaluating priorities, and reminded me that marriage is a two-way street even if I don't think I'm in the wrong. Others shared OSRS memes that kept me laughing through the tough parts. That was cool too. Anyway, here's the update.

TL;DR: We got divorced and I used the time to grind my way to 99 Sailing while handling all the legal stuff, brushed off attempts from her and her mom to patch things up and now I'm single and not totally loving every minute of doing whatever I feel like but it's hard to beat this peaceful freedom. 

After she texted me that things weren't working out, I sat on it for a day or two, still in denial. But the comments and my isolation hit me pretty hard. I realized that both she and you guys had a point about our compatibility. Our 'chill' relationship without arguments? That was probably just me being oblivious while she bottled things up. 

I love OSRS but I was definitely prioritizing it over my connection with my wife. Instead of begging her to come back, I decided to let it go and focus on myself. Called a divorce attorney dude recommended by a buddy who went through something similar. No kids and our finances were mostly separate so it isn't going to be a nightmare (I hope).

The process is likely to take a while so I dove headfirst into OSRS to keep my mind occupied. That huge content update I mentioned? Perfect timing. I'd log in after work, set up some afk methods for other skills, but my main goal became maxing Sailing as a way to cope with things. I grinded charters, did the quests, farmed for boat upgrades all while avoiding calls and ducking text messages from both her family and my own.

Mornings were for coffee and reviewing docs, afternoons for work, evenings for Sailing runs. Hit 99 about a week ago. Cape looks sick, by the way. It was therapeutic, honestly. Kept me from dwelling on the sadness or anger.

I read the bulk of the messages earlier today. A ton of texts apologizing for overreacting and saying she missed me. I didn't respond. Her mom got involved, calling me up from an number I didn't know while I was mid-voyage. I hung up. 

She texted me about about how my wife was ""devastated"" and that we should try counseling because ""gaming addictions can be worked through."" An addiction huh? Alrighty then. Didn't respond.

No hard feelings but I'm not interested in reconnecting. That chapter's closed and I don't care to give either of them any closure or feed into this weird energy they themselves brought into our lives.

Now? Life's 'awesome'. I'm hitting the gym more because of this newfound free time, reconnecting with old friends, and I even went to the park by myself just to hang out at a bench and watch some YouTube.

Not much more to update on. 

Thanks for listening and I hope young men and women can learn from my experiences.

Currently experiencing my first crash,"So where should I start? In september I was really sick, like I had the flu for a couple of weeks, maybe even the whole month. I’ve had a weak immune system for the whole year, meaning I got sick frequently but recovered within 2 weeks. Naturally in september I thought I will recover quickly. Well unfortunately I never recovered. I am 3 months in.

In october I suddenly developed muscle weakness in my legs and arms, also tingling in my extremeties and headache and also dizzyness. I went to GP and he did not know what was going on. I immediately knew this would take weeks or months to figure out what I was suffering from. Long story short: I had 2 MRIs done. Had several appointments with 4 different neurologists, countless appointments with 2 GPs, 1 ENT-doctor, even 1urologist and I have had bloodwork done twice.

2 Neurologists have diagnosed me with post viral fatigue/Long covid. Unfortunately after 3 months you can’t test for covid anymore. The doctors I am seeing say it’s highly like I had a covid infection in september but we will never know for sure since it’s too late to test for covid.

**Status Quo:** 

I can still go to work everyday, but feel tired after. I am not working a hard job. I sit at my desk most of the time, sometimes I attend meetings and I have several hours a day where mostly nothing happens. So that’s good for me.

I stopped working out completely. All of the doctors I had appointments with strongly adviced me to stop working out. Which I did. Before september I worked out in the gym at least 3 times a week sometimes even 5 days, and I went for a quick run on the other 2 days a week. That’s gone now. I only go out for a walk everyday and rest after. I can still manage all the chores around my appartment like doing the dishes or washing my clothes.

I am really focussing on me and what my body is trying to tell me. I am still trying to figure out the whole pacing thing and of course I am going to make mistakes but I try to be as careful as I can. Which means If I don’t feel well I cancel all of my plans and I mean EVERYTHING until I feel better.

I really liked to read books. A lot of them. I recently realized reading makes my symptoms worse, which means I unfortunately stopped reading.

It’s still really hard for me to accept that my life has changed and will continue to change completely. It feels like that most of my personality has been erased by the disease.

Sometimes I feel really lonely since my social life is almost completely gone. I don’t go out to bars after work, I rarely go to restaurants, stopped going to concerts, or the football stadium. I mostly stay home on the weekends and try to recover.

**Symptoms:**

My main symptoms are muscle weakness (especially in my legs), tingling sensation in my arms and legs, sometimes my stomach, overall feeling of being unwell, sore throat and sleep disorder. Also I have become really photosensitive and sensitive to noise.

I have trouble falling asleep and I always wake up everynight. I was prescribed promethazine to help with that and my problems sleeping have decreased a bit. I fall asleep way faster now and when I wake up in the middle of the night I fall asleep again eventually. When this whole disease started I managed to get maybe 2h of sleep everynight in some nights was awake the whole goddamn night. Which was extremely horrible and fortunately has improved for 2-3 weeks now.

Due to the muscle weakness in my legs I walk very slowly now. My coworkers have asked me why I walk in such a weird way. Well that’s because I have to focus on my legs while walking. My muscles in my arms feel so weak that they are shaking most of the time. When I hold my phone in my hands it feels like I am holding a 5 lbs brick in my hand.

**The Crash:**

Definitely triggered by all the trouble from christmas. I had to travel several hundred miles on 24th, we had dinner, loud conversations and was exposed to other loud noises. On 25th I had to travel the same distance back to where I live and on 26th again 2hours long drive to my gf’s family. And to be completely honest on every single day of christmas I was either having a heated discussion with my family, a big fight with my gf and my gf had a fight with her family. So to summarise this up, christmas was absolutely horrible and I did way too much and rested way too little.

The following 2 days after christmas I just stayed in bed and rested but it was too late. The crash was inevitable. On Saturday I realized I was way more sensitive to bright light and noises than before, my  throat was more sore than ever before, I felt like I had the flu and every move I made just felt wrong. Muscles were weaker than before and just standing up from bed took up more energy than before. Sometimes I felt like I was about to have a panic attack (but that feeling vanished quickly) or a heart attack. I feel like I am in the middle of a crash and I don’t know how long it will go on for.

**Treatment/Game plan:**

Getting better at pacing.

I am taking Vitamin D and Vitamin B12 daily. I have made changes to my diet (whole foods, cut out sugar and processed food), stopped drinking alcohol completely since this makes everything worse. I even quit drinking coffee and limit my screentime to less than 2h a day.

I keep a diary on my symptoms and activities on a daily basis to identify self destructive patterns or realize what might trigger a crash.

I have reduced my working hours to like 60% for the next 2 weeks and after that I took a paid leave for 2 weeks to rest. I am willing to cut down the workload even more. I don’t want to quit my job but if it’s necessary to recover I will eventually do that.

I cut down all my fix costs and subscriptions to being able to save as much money as I can since I know I might not be able to work anymore in the future.

Also I am taking off-label medication to fight the symptoms (which my doctors have recommended). And I am seeing a GP and a neurologist on a monthly basis. Apparently fighting this disease is a trail and error thing.

I know I will be making mistakes. I know this will be the hardest fight of my life. I know I might never fully recover. I know there will be really bad days. There is a chance I will never be the same person again. But still I have to fight and try my best.

Long Covid isn’t over. Covid is there to stay. Unfortunately most doctors, governments, pharmaceutical companies don’t care for it anymore. I know It’s been 5 year since covid hit the planet and when everything seemed getting back to normal I was infected.

This post is to let you know, you are not alone.

Happy new year everyone!

The first one is cliche but it really does help. Take it one day at a time. Just concentrate on staying sober for 24 hours. Don’t sit and plan your year (but I have a vacation in April and a wedding in August etc.) it will become very overwhelming and seem impossible. You only have to stay sober for 24 hours. Then tomorrow you do the same.

The second thing is realising you’re not spoiling anything for anyone else by not drinking. Your friends/family don’t need you to drink to have a good time. You’re not as important to everyone else’s enjoyment as you think. Let go of that pressure, they’ll be fine.

The next thing is I think a lot of us were never really shown how to enjoy life sober. It’s time to start romanticising your life. Make yourself a decent dinner that you look forward to at the end of the day. Run a bubble bath. Wear fresh cozy pyjamas. Clean your bedding. Light a candle. Play computer games. Watch that movie you’ve been putting off. Read a book. Go for walks and really breathe the air. Drink soft drinks from fancy glasses with ice. Have a selection of comforting hot drinks (teas, hot chocolate, coffee). Take multivitamins. Hydrate your body. Start feeling good. 

The last thing is it takes practice. If you slip up it’s ok. I don’t think anyone here manage long term sobriety on the first try but you have to keep trying. 

Have a wonderful 2026 everyone. IWNDWYT🤟🥳",4,1767260626.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

We had a dysfunctional relationship by this time, mainly centered around her penchant for always getting in these fixes and needing a bail-out. The final straw was I suspected she was cheating on me (which proved to be true later).  One day she told me she was going to be gone for a week to visit her relatives in another state. I asked her if she would like me to come (she hadn’t offered), to which she said “No, I will be fine”. 

So yeah, I was not liking this explanation and at the time I was already thinking of just exiting from the relationship due to the drama and trust issues. During her absence, I ended up talking to a woman on a local chat line for a few days and we agreed to meet for coffee snd and a movie date. Unusual for me, I did not ask for her picture prior to meeting (you can see where this is going). 

When we met we changed our plans and went straight to a movie. When I saw her first time she did not look anything like she described herself,for one,  she was carrying more weight than what I liked (my girlfriend at time was thin so I initially thought this was a step down) and was older in the face than what I expected. So yeah, no physical chemistry on my end. I am not saying I am anything great or even good, but  I like what I like. Still, for purposes of being respectful I stayed with the date, watched the movie with her, then she asked if we could go to the beach (this was night) and park the car. I felt obligated or just didn’t know what to do but we ended up at the beach. It was awkward because she got out came over and grabbed my hand we walked a bit down the beach and when we got back to the car she gets in the back seat and again, I have no explanation, but I complied and we just sit and talk, awkward, she is doing most the talking as I am feeling like zoned out being with someone I don’t connect with. I ended up cutting it short by saying it is late and I need to get home due to work next day. I drive her back to her car, give her a hug and thank her for the “date”. 

When I get home I felt literally sick to my stomach, first from guilt stepping out on my gf (even though she was awful to me), then second, realizing that all I have is her. After this experience I just stopped trying to meet someone better. The next couple days the woman I met left messages asking if I was ok, leaving impression she wanted to see me again, but like a jerk I never replied back. She stopped after 2 days. 

Eventually, within a few months my gf ended up dumping me for another guy she met, which later I found out was someone she was already seeing for months behind my back. I took a breather after this and 2 years later I went into a store and was in an aisle and walked past this woman who said my name like she knew me, I turned around and at first didn’t recognize her, it was the same woman I went on the date with and rejected. Only she was thinner and changed her hair color to blonde. When I realized who she was I told her I was so sorry and wished that I realized I made a mistake because she was a nice person to me. She asked why didn’t I return my messages do I told her my situation at the time, but not telling her part of it was simply I wasn’t not feeling attracted to her. 

We ended exchanging phone numbers, so a few days later I called and we talked and she asked if I would like to have dinner at her house. We met at her house, she cooked a nice dinner and we watched a movie, she showed me her house which was in state of being renovated. She knew I worked in construction and asked if I might be interested in helping her do repairs. 

So for next 3 weeks I was working on the house every day, she would fix me dinner after which we would watch a movie or talk on the couch then I’d crash out on her spare bed, rinse and repeat,during this time we never did anything more than converse, I did make an attempt to hug her but she said “good night” as a way to end that gesture of affection. I ended up feeling rejected, just as she must have felt, because this clearly wasn’t going to go anywhere. I ended up coming to her house when she was at work, got my tools, and left her her house key. I called her and got a vm, to which I said I was sorry but this isn’t working out. She called me back and left me vm saying she didn’t understand, the house was coming along well. 

Yeah it was just a weird situation, I felt like she had no intention of picking up where we left off, trying to date each other, instead lot felt like just she was taking revenge out having me work for free on her house.",4,1767260457.0,confession,8,0.64,False

1q10gp5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q10gp5,My GOAT Pens of 2025,"I thought 2025 would be the year I achieved pen peace, that I was done and could finally close my pen fund.

Obviously, that didn't happen.

Here's a breakdown of my top pens of 2025!  Note that most of these are either self-tuned, customized, or frankenpens or both, and that they are either heavy wet flexxers or heavy double/ triple broads. They are also on the relatively affordable side. This is important, because these pens go through ink like me on coffee, and you WILL need extra cash to buy more.

And now, the pens:

**Kanwrite Legacy**\- with sizeable converters and ebonite feeds, these are wonderful wet pens that take a wide variety of nibs. They are gushers and pair fantastically with thirsty FPR/ Kanwrite ultraflex nibs, or any B/BB nib, and Kanwrite BBB nibs.

**Noodlers Neponset**\- much maligned, but fantastic bargains for their modular nature \**if bought cheaply aftermarket.* They'll take almost any #6 nib. This one has a Chinese Broad Architect nib.

**Jinhao 9019**\- a #8 nib demonstrator with a massive converter. The nib is fine, but it shines with a Kanwrite Flex, Noodlers, or Neponset nib: perfect ink flow that never stalls or puddles. Don't ask me why a #6 nib fits so well on a #8 feed and collar; they pair like they were made for each other - assuming you get a working Neponset nib (which isn't easy).

It also works great with a #6 Chinese BB nib, the generic ones meant to be ground. Pair them, and you have a massive pen indistinguishable from a felt marker. Yum.

**Lemon M1**\- a heavy (brass?) piston filler with a wide variety of nib width options, including massive 1.7 mm widths. Almost too much, even for me, so I switched the nib with a more manageable Jowo BB. The enamel lemon on the cap is a cute touch.

**Majohn Craftsman P140** \- a piston demonstrator with an excellent slightly bouncy #8 ""Sun"" nib and an ebonite feed. Paired with a custom #8 Jinhao ultraflex nib from 365 Days, this is one mean flex pen meant to be tamed...or is it meant to tame *you*?",3,1767260261.0,fountainpens,0,0.8,False

1q10dv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1q10dv5/what_to_buy_during_your_china_trip_except_for/,What to buy during your China trip (except for common products),"Hello, I would like to share with you some shopping tips if ever you come to China and want to bring some specialties when you fly back home, here are some of ideas from my personal perspective: 
1, Tea, in Beijing you have Jasmin tea which we call « tea de table » for daily drink, but the most famous ones are produced in Fujian(black tea, rock tea), Yunnan(Black tea), and Hangzhou( Green tea) , personally I like Zhengshanxiaozhong(正山小种) which is THE tea we exported to Europe back in ancient time, and Dahongpao（大红袍）、Rougui（肉桂), Puer(普洱）. You could buy them in physical shop or order them online(Taobao) , if you have time, I recommand you to go into a tea shop and ask if you could taste before purchase. The preference may vary from person to person, the price may expensive and also depends on the harvest zone or year. Well if you go to Chengdu, they have great tea culture, but the most famous teas are not produced there…. 
2, Custom suit, I heard of this idea from my French ex, because the price is good（not sure now, it becomes more expensive then before), and we have all textile ￼￼￼￼to choose from. Maybe in the south you have more this kind of shop, in Beijing you have Hongdu(red city, 红都), this brand is THE most low-key brand, it makes suits, shirts for ambassaders, company leaders, and all official occasions, all its tailors were from Shanghai in 80s and found the brand together, younger generation don’t know this brand, when I came back home in Beijing, I bought 3 ready-to wear winter jackets there in their shopping store( not the one for its custom service) , quality is good, jackets for around 200euro-400euros; Shanghai, the price may be close to that of European countries. 
3, Why not a quick medical exam in clinic or Chinese medical center, just to check health condition. Don’t forget to reserve a Chinese massage, SPA or Thermal aquarium with buffet à volonté. The biggest one in Beijing is call Ninth(九号)
4, Glasses 👓, I made 2 pairs of my glasses for 70 -90 euros in Panjiayuan Glass center(潘家园眼镜城） in Beijing, including vision check and production fees, you bring it immediately with you on the same day, same as above, the price maybe higher according to the brand and quality. Be aware that the Glass center are huge!!!!! It is a giant shopping center with enormous vendors, they sell almost the same thing, price and styles are différent, once selected, you need to wait until they deliver you the glasses, after that, you need absolutely check if it suits you well !!! The process is continuous and they won’t waste time on every customer, so you need to check for your myself.  If glasses are necessary for you, don’t forget to give one whole day to go there(maybe quicker than that, but still need half day) , but avoid weenkend, too crowded. It says that all glasses are from Danyang, Jiangsu province, it’s the original production place but I think maybe not everybody wants to go there on purpose just to make glasses since it’s not a tourist destination, but in Beijing I’m sure it’s on your trip list. 
5, Go to Chuji (褚暨）for pearls, go to Lianyungang （连云港） for cristals, for entrepreneurs who want to starts business in jewelry, these two places are close to Shanghai/Hangzhou, they sell raw materials in tons. But If you are in fantaisie business, Guangzhou（广州） is the best place to go. 
6, Do you know that it is popular among the Chinese elites to drink Yunnan wine and coffee? LVMH invested in some harvest zones and the Yunnan red wine wins little by little younger fans taste; Nestle also invested in Yunnan for coffee beans. Although l’eau de vie(we call it white wine) Maotai is the national treasure, it didn’t sell well recent years, price is too high and mostly for formal occasions (Marriage, business lunch, etc.) that younger generation don’t usually get involved in. It seems to me that we have Riesling In Xinjiang, Ningxia or Shangri-la(Yunnan), those are high class red wines that few people know. 

In recent years, we have lots of immaterial heritage that has been promoted and liked among the younger generation, bracelets, lanterns, silk clothes(accessories), boxes, wood sculptures, etc. I think one can’t bring them all back home,  but it worth experiencing at the place during your trip, try some one-day experience, like the tea salon. 

If you have any other ideas, feel free to share, I  myself didn’t go to any corner of China but I’m interested to discover myself the best products here, so many great things along with its culture, history at good price.

I do have a temporary cheap replacement glass one and the filter barely does anything - my mug is full of coffee fines.

Several stainless steel ones online have reviews suggesting problems like:

\- Water leaking between the wall layers

\- Rust forming

\- Horrible scratchy noise when plunging

\- Only 1 or 2 mesh layers, so poor filtering

So in my search for a high quality stainless steel French press I came across the Espro P7, which has been recommended in this sub, but this seems to have it's own problems:

\- Plastic filter mechanism (big no no)

\- Some coffee lost at the end (due to design)

\- More difficult to clean

\- Really expensive

So I think I've ruled out the Espro, mainly due to the plastic filter mechanism, but I must admit I'm happy to have a rubber gasket around the filter to prevent the scratchy noise.

She is on the metro, standing near the door, rehearsing what she’ll say when she finally sees him. They have exchanged photos, voice notes, jokes about bad coffee. This is the first time they will exist in the same physical space. She checks the time again, then the reflection of her face in the glass.

The train slows, then stops between stations.
At first, no one reacts. A few seconds stretch into a minute. Someone sighs. Someone taps their foot. A man asks, loudly, if this line is always this unreliable. Phones come out. Messages are typed and erased. She drafts a text explaining she might be late, then deletes it. It feels too eager.
An announcement crackles. “There has been an incident on the tracks. We appreciate your patience.”

Patience thins quickly. A woman complains about missing a meeting. A teenager laughs and says, “Of course this would happen today.” Someone mutters that they should have taken a cab. The air grows warmer. Time becomes heavy.
Another passenger whispers what the incident is. The word moves through the carriage quietly, without urgency, like a rumor that has already lost its shock.

She feels it land, then slide off. The dominant thought is still the same: He’s waiting. She finally sends the text. “Train’s stalled. I’m sorry.”
When the train starts moving again, relief ripples through the car. People straighten, ready to continue their lives. By the time the doors open, the incident has become a delay, then a story, then nothing.

Above lines, someone is dead.
She is late for a date.

Every time one points out the rot of the spirit here, someone reflexively brings up the mountains or the Balloon Fiesta as if a landscape or a week-long spectacle could ever be a substitute for a functioning human society. It is a profound category error. Every town in this country has some manner of hiking or trails within twenty minutes of its center; to name such a common thing as a primary virtue is a desperate grasping at straws. Furthermore, it is a gross impracticality. One does not depart daily labor to go hiking every evening. Nature has its place, but a city is meant to be the destination of our daily lives. And the balloons? Even on the day of the fiesta, once they land, then what? One is still standing in the same dead vacuum. It is a gimmick, not a heartbeat.

The reality here is a haunting existential emptiness. People point to Old Town or Nob Hill, but they are nothing more than hollow stage sets. Old Town is just a cluster of repetitive themed shops that shut their doors early and leave behind a ghost town. Nob Hill is the same story. You have a few houses of coffee that close their doors and then the street is just a dead void. There is nobody even out there. One walks through an urban graveyard of vacant lots and boarded up buildings. It is not a city; it is a collection of gaps held together by stucco and dust. We have built a monument to the interval and forgotten the substance.

We have mistaken sprawl for growth and silence for peace. I have lived in tiny villages in the middle of winter that felt more alive than this. I have been to places in the deepest deserts where the hospitality is the very air one breathes, where the human connection is the destination. In those places you are invited in for coffee and you have real friends and you have a shared life. There is an organic warmth there that exists in the heart. Here there is no there there. This place is miles of fences designed to keep people apart. It is the physical manifestation of total social isolation. It is a place where the common ground has been replaced by an empty lot.

What is worse is the constant censoring of the spirit. People here are so busy coping with their lot that they try to shut down anyone who speaks the truth. If you voice how much this place fails the soul, they act as if you are the problem, but everybody knows the truth. They know the depth of the failure whether they admit it or not. The slow pace and the quiet air are just polite euphemisms for a place that has surrendered. It is a hollowed out shell. You deal with the desolation and the boarded up windows but you get nothing in return. No vibrancy, no connection, and no spontaneous human life.

A real city should have an energy that exists upon the sidewalk. It should be a reason to be outside where you actually encounter other people. But here the path is just a lonely way between two locked doors. You are left with nothing to do but sit in a common room alone, watching the world pass by through glass, because everything else is either a tavern or a ruin. Albuquerque does not just lack energy; it is a void where a community is supposed to be. It is a desert of the soul. We have built a metropolis and forgotten to invite the people. It does not just lack things to do; it lacks the very essence of what makes human habitation meaningful. It is a vastness that offers no shelter and a desert that offers no company",0,1767258776.0,Albuquerque,46,0.33,False
1q102ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1q102ni/will_i_ever_find_my_tribe/,Will I ever find my tribe?,"Sigh. I thought after a year of dealing with my diagnosis of being Autistic and ADHD that I could start living my dream life. Of taking back my life and having genuine connections by way of my unmasking and living an authentic life. But it’s not all it’s cracked out to be. I don’t know if it’s the looseness of the holidays, the time of the month or things are really hard or all of it combined but I’m struggling mentally. This is not how I imagined the first day of the New Year would begin. I decided for Christmas to not go back to my home town because last year, I went home after a full year of teaching and it burned me out on top of already being burnt out. I have been eating well and exercising and trying to do that Somatic nervous system stuff but you know, even when you do all the things you think you should to get back to baseline it can still end in a big meltdown and feeling depleted. Someone I was seeing casually, unfollowed me and I don’t know why but it bothered me so much so I blocked him from all social media because I could recognise it wasn’t good for me in the first place and I needed to not leave that door open. That was hard but then I realised my ONE good friend at my CrossFit gym who invites me to all coffee get togethers with other members has stopped talking to me a week ago. I didn’t think much of it at first. I just thought she doesn’t have to invite me to everything, you know, that’s why I’ve started going to these meet up events so I can practise small talk and cast my net out a bit more. I went to a lunch and met some really cool people and that’s when I realised, everyone here is genuinely looking to ‘connect’ with people who are strangers and they are listening to me and I am listening to them. That doesn’t really happen for me at my gym even though I’ve been there 3 years and it is my only source of a social life other than work. And then I saw online that my only gym friend went and did an event that I have been trying to do with her and some others and it was obvious I was left out on purpose because I live near the event and it was my idea. They didn’t invite me, she didn’t invite me even though I lived so close and even though she knew I wanted to do that event with them. I was upset and went back and forth in my head and then I just did what I thought was the only option. I restricted all my stories and I put them on mute for all social media and I’ve been staying off it all day. My therapist said when you have big emotions don’t write messages or emails so I isolated myself. I felt stupid for being an adult and for crying over dumb stuff like that. I saw my life flash before my eyes of every failed social interaction except with my only best friend who lives overseas. I know it’s part of the package but I cried all day for that little girl who will never be invited to be part of the ‘game.’ A previous gym friend who moved overseas and has been a support and safe place to vent told me, that my gym, she used to be a member is very into ‘cliques’ and it’s not really a place for genuine lifelong friendships, everyone is trying to be part of something bigger than themselves. They get in the groups and post all these stories. She told me that’s what you call ‘fake friends’ and it’s normal that some people only last for a season. She said it’s like that everywhere which is why she connects with people but makes sure that there’s enough distance and when she sees their true nature she limits contact and just lets them be at their ‘game’ while she observes from the outside. I feel like someone has just told me there’s no Santa Claus because I don’t play games. For whatever reason I was left out, I think it’s their choice and they don’t have to include me, it’s actually better for me to ‘know’ but that feeling. That hole in my heart. And that question, I’m 42… where do I belong? Will I ever find my place, my tribe? Or is this it? Just forever lonely and… different.

I use a mokapot as my daily driver. I usually drink extremely light specialty roasts and love all the subtle flavors and slight acidity. However, for some reason I haven't been able to enjoy the specialty dark roasts... You may say perhaps I don't like dark roasts, but when I go to my parents, as they are older Italian people they use supermarket preground lavazza... And you know what? I think it can actually taste pretty good. I don't get how years old preground supermarket robusta coffee can somehow taste better and more acidic/less bitter than fresh, high quality specialty 100% arabica.

I've also bought from two of the top roasters in my country (Bugan and Gardelli's cignobianco blend), so I am completely puzzled. Just to be clear, I've loved their lighter roasts, but as for the dark roasts they somehow always come out more bitter and less acidic than Lavazza preground and this has me scratching my head so hard.

Yes I'm grinding coarser but it's getting quite coarse now, I'm at 65 clicks on my kingronder k6 and it definitely looks a lot coarser than preground and I normally am in the 40 clicks range with lighter roast coffee.",1,1767258581.0,JamesHoffmann,2,1.0,False

Etiwanda, 1975 — The New Year’s Eve Gongyo That Became a Temple in Retrospect

⸻

1975. New Year’s Eve.
Someone in LA says, “We’re going to Etiwanda.”
Nobody asks where in Etiwanda. That would miss the point.

⸻

The Drive

Caravans roll east out of Los Angeles like it’s a spiritual evacuation drill.
Someone chants in the passenger seat. Someone else just wants coffee.
Miss an exit? Obviously a karmic lesson.
Every mile adds sincerity.

“This matters,” someone says.
No one knows why, but everyone agrees.

⸻

Arrival

You pull into what appears to be a high school gym.
Basketball hoops. Painted court lines. That weird gym smell.

But tonight — and tonight only — this is The Etiwanda Temple.

Volunteers with flashlights wave cars into parking spots with the authority of monks who did traffic duty once and never emotionally recovered.

⸻

Inside the “Temple”

Folding chairs. Rows and rows.
A portable altar that arrived earlier and will leave quietly later.
Space heaters fighting for their lives.

Someone whispers, “Sit up straight.”
Someone else whispers, “This decides the whole year.”

No pressure.

⸻

Pre-Midnight

It’s 11:42 PM.
Everyone checks their watch.
Someone checks again, just in case midnight moved.

A leader offers guidance that sounds calm but lands heavy:
“This moment determines everything.”

You consider leaving.
You immediately decide against it, for reasons unclear.

⸻

Midnight

No countdown. No cheering.
The clock flips and — boom — Gongyo.

Chanting fills the gym-temple-hall-place.
Someone cries.
Someone feels nothing and quietly panics about that.
Someone resolves never to miss this again (a promise valid until the early ’80s).

The New Year has been opened correctly.
No one explains what happens if it isn’t.

⸻

After Midnight

A few hugs. Mostly silence.
People look relieved but also oddly unsatisfied.
Volunteers are already stacking chairs because sacred time has a strict rental agreement.

⸻

Teardown

The altar disappears.
The temple evaporates.
The gym slowly returns to being just a gym.

By 2:00 AM, the only evidence left is:
	•	tired members
	•	sore legs
	•	and a janitor who does not appear spiritually transformed

⸻

The Drive Home

Quiet. Exhausted.
Everyone knows they just participated in something historic.

No photos.
No address.
Just the certainty that this will be remembered as permanent.

⸻

Years Later

Someone says, “We used to go to the Etiwanda Temple for New Year’s Eve Gongyo.”
Everyone nods.
No one asks why it had basketball hoops.

1q0zty2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0zty2,"You wanted proof about Priyasha Das (CrackXAT)? Well, here it is.","Hi everyone, saw a lot of posts recently about Priyasha Das, owner of the XAT ""study"" platform called CrackXAT being exposed for the fraud she is, and a lot of comments defending her and asking for concrete proof. Priyasha Das, also known as CrackXAT, is actually from the XLRI Online program (XOL), a program that does not require cracking XAT to enroll into.

I am from the XLRI HRM batch of 2022-2024, the very batch she claims to belong to. I can assure you that Priyasha Das is not from my batch or any core XLRI batch, and I will be following this up with concrete proof.

I just wanted to start with saying that while being an educator is a noble endeavor, it is immoral and deceptive to blatantly lie or hide the fact that you have never given the exam that you teach thousands about. It is also unfair to us 510 XLRI Jsr and Delhi batch of 2022-24 students, people who actually worked hard to clear XAT and the interviews, that a fraud has mooched off of us and managed to create a monetized platform based on a bed of lies.

After that preface, here is the proof you all wanted after the surprisingly obvious red flags (you really thought an actual MBA students would get the time to go home, live stream, and make content in the MIDDLE of her MBA/ post-MBA job?)

1. Her LinkedIn account:
Funny story, during our time at XL, we as a batch protested against this fraudulent behaviour. The professors agreed with us and mandated that all XOL students need to mention XOL on their social media platforms. This mandate, clearly, is not being followed by some, because if you look at Priyasha Das's LinkedIn right now, picture 1 is what you will see. However, while she was still under scrutiny back in 2023-24, she had changed her LinkedIn account to mention XOL (ref. picture 2). You can clearly see XOL in her bio and on her LinkedIn header.

2. XLRI's student list for 2022-24:
XLRI publishes a convocation report after every convocation with a complete list of students. The brochure for XLRI 2022-24 can be found on this link and by googling XLRI's 68th annual convocation and clicking the first link ->
 https://www.xlri.ac.in/convocation-brochures/68-annual-convocation-2024

Surprising, isn't it, that the XLRI 2022-24 PGDHRM ""Dean's Merit List rank 2"" doesn't feature here at all? Wait...could it all have been a big lie?

3. The XOL Brochure:
An official piece of XLRI documentation that does mention Ms. Priyasha here is the XOL brochure, which also has all the resumes of XOL students. Not sharing the screenshot here (don't want to breach her privacy) even though this copy can be found on the coffee tables of XLRI Jsr, but I assure you that is where you can find Miss Ma'am there, as well as the fact that she was working with Infosys for 2019-2024, a fact she has cleverly hidden on LinkedIn. To reiterate, you cannot have a full time job while also doing the core MBA courses 

4. Priyasha Das herself?:
You will see that all of Priyasha's live GK/ VA/ DM sessions from 2022-2024 were made in the comfort of her own home. Day scholars are not allowed in XLRI. Do you really believe that she went home during the busy MBA schedule every day to make these videos? Why didnt she make them in her hostel room like all other legitimate XLRI content creators? 


But OP, how did Priyasha Das pull this off?

4 things. Using the vulnerability of aspirants, the 2 visits a year she gets at XLRI main campus, the fact that her home is in Jamshedpur, and the XLRI XAT creators event.

Everytime she visits campus, be it the biannual visits she used to get as an XOL student, or by coming in campus during events, or as someone's guest (she lives in Jsr), she makes a load of reels and content, and posts and reposts these throughout the year. Being one of the few XAT content creators, she also comes to the XAT content creators summit, which is how she makes the videos with the XAT convenor. A few XLRI profs are common between the XOL and the core courses, which is why she has videos with a couple of professors too. 

What truly surprises me is the extent to which she has gone to keep up this facade. Not only does she masquerade as a student from our batch, she also had someone order one of our batch hoodies (pic 3) to cement this lie. People from our batch could get anyone's names printed on the back - even I got one for my brother.

You look at her entire social media feed, and you will find clips in campus, her getting her XOL degree, her sitting with the XAT convenor, and her interviewing XLRI students - anything to attempt to legitimize this painfully, meticulously crafted fraud. 

Giving out free content is one thing - she has also monetized her guidance. From selling GK pdfs for 150 to sessions with her for thousands, lord only knows how much she has earned from this scam (pics 4, 5). Please do verify an educators background before you throw money at them!

Finally, i would like to mention that if students have found Priyasha's content helpful, they are most welcome to follow it. Just be aware that the XLRI creator you idolize never Cracked XAT at all, and has so far been deceiving you. And to Priyasha - please stop lying the very students that trust you blindly. If you trust in the content you teach, be transparent, be open, and stop hiding your identity.

honestly, your absolute best option to skip the meridian street traffic and the freezing walk from campus overflow is to check out prked. it's an app where people rent out their driveways or garages, and you can find spots on the residential streets right next to the arena, way cheaper than trying to deal with campus lots and you can basically cut the line. it’s a short walk and you’re in and out fast.  
  
if you gotta stick to the free spots though, timing is everything. for a 6:07 pm start, you really need to be pulling into the lssu campus lots by 5:00 pm at the absolute latest. the main lot right by the arena (usually lot g) is the closest, but it fills first and is a nightmare for exiting, the traffic backs up badly after the game. if you want to get out quickly, use the overflow lots further back, like the ones near the cisler center or down the hill near the administration buildings. the walk is longer but you can get on ashmun street faster after the horn.  
  
don't even think about street parking on the residential roads unless you absolutely have to and are prepared for a long, cold trek. it's sault ste. marie on jan 3rd- winter parking restrictions are going to be in full effect, plowing reduces available spots dramatically, and the tickets are not cheap. if you do street park, pay very close attention to any posted signs, especially for overnight bans, and prepare for a very icy walk. it’s better to be in a legit lssu lot that's somewhat plowed.  
  
the biggest tip is to just arrive early, maybe grab a coffee at the cisler center first, and avoid the main lot entrance and exit at all costs if you want a clean getaway. hope this helps and go lakers!",1,1767257431.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1q0zndn,https://www.reddit.com/r/helpme/comments/1q0zndn/blegh/,Blegh :),"I care alot. Even if it's probably not a big deal. I still feel. I dont know why.

I wont get mad. I wont get upset. I wont show anything anymore. Its not her fault. Shes right. I deserve to suffer. Worthless waste of space. You know she doesnt think fond of you. Maybe she once did, you ruined it. Its my fault. At some point i thought i had some right to be happy, so i fought for it. I fought with her. I argued when she hurt me. I explained my perspective or how i felt. She didnt like it.

I was wrong. She was right, if i ruined everything, i deserve the pain. New year new me. I wont be a burden. I wont be a bother. She wont even have to think of me. I dont care anymore. Aslong as she is happy. Why? I made a commitment when started dating. My feelings dont matter. They never did, atleast to her. She opened my eyes to the truth, a worthless person deserves to be hurt, to be forgotten, and in her doing so she reminded me of my place. I love her. I know because im still trying. Or maybe for myself. To be of some worth to someone. To bring her atleast some joy, gives me- a worthless person, some worth. But is that not just selfish? Then id be doing it for me still. I dont know. I dont know anything. Youre an idiot. Too scared to ask her. I can only hope im what she wants, not for my validation. But so shes happy with me. I hope shes happy. Ill try harder this year. Cast aside my feelings. Focus only on her. I won't tell her. I wont make it obvious. Ill always appear cheery. To cheer her up. I dont want her pity. I dont deserve her reassurance. I just hope she knows im trying. Deep down i know she doesnt love me. I know she wont say it to me directly. I wish i could stop the pain. I want to see her. To be with her. To bother her. But ill only annoy her more in the end. Im a wreck now. Its pathetic. 

I hate what ive become. More of a loser. No motivation- so i live on coffee, no sleep, crying like a bitch late into the night- so i drink, hoping i would be able to sleep. I understand it now, i never did before, its brief, but alcohol makes you happy, it made me care less. Its beautifuly numbing. Ive even lost my conviction it seems, i never thought id be the type to sneak drinks. But i need it, its gotten worse. The pain, the overthinking, the stuff i used to go to her for help, but i cant. Not anymore. Never again. Im a mess now. I used to be different, strong in my own way id say. I didnt care about others opinions much, alcohol was a foreign thought rather than a common tool, sleep was a neccesity to build my muscle and body. But the motivation is gone. I dont eat well anymore. I dont workout anymore, it was my favorite hobby. I dont sleep. Its laziness, i feel like im withering away. I hate being like this and im not blaming her. Im doing it now because its easy. Its easy to be lazy. So i can save my energy to suffer instead. It doesnt matter. She wont see any of this, not that she would care, she wont help me. Again im not blaming her for it. Its understandable. Im sorry. How do i fix things? How do i make you happy? Itd be better if i was gone. Maybe then she'd actually be happy. Maybe one day I'll understand, ill know how to be better. Happy new year :3

Haha loser. She's already ignoring you. You know it. You know it's not new either. It still hurts. Each time. When will it stop? Please stop it. Why? Why me? Liar, selfish, meanie. Please, im not mad, im not angry, just hurt. I know this is the solution, despite the pain, i know im on the right track. If i keep being nice. Maybe ill get more than scraps. More than i deserve. Because she never really cared when i was hurt. She only cared about the fact that i was mad at her. Not why. Ignoring the hurt deep down only to offer surface level solutions. But i deserve it. Im no better. Why do i lash out? Why do i get angry? Im an idiot. A stupid idiot. But its okay. Never again. Only happy :) no matter what!! 

Deep down. I do want her to notice. To care. Even if i dont deserve it. But i wont admit it. I wont admit anything. Its for the best. Its what i promised. A new years resolution of sorts.

She used to care so much. She came into my life. Approached me. Asked me out. I knew i shouldnt have. I even thought i wouldn't be hurt, despite the risks. I was so cocky. Ive heard of being lovebombed and then being ghosted. I dont know if it applies. Maybe she got bored of me. We barely talk nowadays, havent seen each other in real life for a month. My messages go on delivered for hours. Seen sometimes too. Shes online sometimes aswell. Ignoring me. Two message strings per day from her now. Even though i reply almost instantly. Its like she throws her phone away whenever i message. She says shes busy. Liar. I tried matching her energy, messaging less. I tried being nicer. Maybe i am just a loser? I didnt care so much at first obviously. A month of mixed signals a silence though? Apparently enough to break me. Maybe im weak.

In the end i dont know what to do. She still says she loves me. Although more rarely now. I remember she even once promised to say 'i love you' daily, I joked about it, saying if she didnt it means she hates me. Did she really forget? Or does she not care anymore? Deep down i know the answers. But im a coward. Idiot. Why do i care so much?

I hate caring. It leaves me with so many questions, questions i cant answer, or well some im too afraid of answering. But i need to care. About her. For her. Herherherher. Shes the only thing on my mind. Does she know? Would she want to know? Would she be happy to know she's loved? I would. But no. If i wanted to know. I could always just ask. She answers. But a selfish part of me wants to not have to ask. I hate that. I hate the part of me that always wants more. Despite promising to be happy with whatever.

I wrote this down to understand. But even im lost now. Someone help. I dont know anything.  Im scared.

You know she doesnt care anymore. Youre nothing. Nothing at all to her. But isnt it nice? Bring forgetable is good. Im happy.

For decades, he was able to manage his BP1 with meds and therapy.  Approximately 10 or so years ago, his mother passed away after from Alzheimer's.  As a result of their struggles with his father's mental illness late in his life, friend and mom were very close.  Her passing seemed to be the trigger that sent him off the rails.  Within months of her passing, he went off his meds.  When my wife and I attended his birthday party that year, we had no idea.  Less than a year later, he had lost his job/career, his long term girlfriend, his home, pretty much everything.  I didn't know until stopping by his place randomly one day to find the landlord cleaning the place out.  A call to his girlfriend (who by then had left him) confirmed my worst fears.  To my knowledge, he never came back from it and is still out there somewhere or dead.

I've only seen him 3 times since then, always worse off than before.  The last time, he showed up randomly at my home while I was at work and was so far gone, my wife wouldn't let him in.  I had to come home to intervene.  All I could do for him at that point was give him some food and whatever cash and cigarettes I had on me.  I pleaded with him to come back the next day.  He didn't.

It has been at least 6 years since I've seen him.  To my knowledge, mutual friends haven't seen him, either.  The last reference to him is an arrest report from about 5 years ago.  His mugshot was a person I barely recognized.

No matter what was happening, we always got together on Christmas Day every year and had coffee & exchanged simple gifts.  We'd talk about life, relationships, music, Star Wars, computers and Nine Inch Nails.  It's been about a decade since our last Christmas visit.  For all I know, he could be dead at this point and I wouldn't know it.

So I (29f) and my bf (26m) have been in a relationship for 2 years and 11 months, and on October 10th of 2025 we got our first apartment together. I noticed relatively quickly I was doing most of the cleaning, dishes, vacuuming, wiping down surfaces, shared laundry like bed sheets and throw blankets, meal planning, cooking, grocery shopping, etc. I had said before moving in I don't mind doing most of the basic cleaning of the floors and furniture since I have pets and they leave hair and track litter around as pets do. But it has quickly spiraled beyond that. He is a mechanic and leaves his dirty laundry in the floor, leaves crumbs all over the counter, just sets dirty dishes in the sink, multiple cups around the apartment, waits until his stinky laundry is filling the air before doing his laundry, refuses to shower before bed (making the bed stink like car and bad body odor), leaves toothpaste in the sink, pee on the toilet and floor, never refills the Brita dispenser, leaves dirty tools and bolts and hats everywhere, etc. he was walking around on our CARPETS with his oily work shoes and finally stopped when I threatened to throw the shoes away due to the black oil stains now on our beige carpets. I have talked to him multiple times in passing since we moved in. ""Hey, rinse your toothpaste down the drain, hey you peed in the floor again can you clean it up, hey you need to change clothes before sitting on the couch or getting in bed, hey please shower, hey can you wash your dishes"" etc. to no avail of course. Just a ""sorry"" and half ass fixing this issue. Background, I came from a hoarder house and grew up in filth so cleanliness and organization is important to me, and he comes from a nice clean home where Mommy did almost everything for him. I had had enough. So a four days ago, I stopped cleaning up after him. No change, so 3 days ago, I stopped cleaning and cooking period. No change, so today, I started making messes. I drained the brita, I left towels on the floor, knocked over the coasters and left them, left hair blobs in the shower, emptied the qtip jar, left crumbs and dirty dishes everywhere including the living room, dirty clothes all over the floor, balled up bed blankets, shoes in front of the front door, dirty qtips and floss on the coffee table, throw blankets in the floor, tracked leaves onto the carpets (all stuff he has done). He confronted me and asked what was up because I ""never do this"" I said ""oh we leave everything everywhere now just the way you like it, it's fine"", needless to say he got upset and asked why I didn't have a conversation with him about this instead, I said I had asked him multiple times over the past couple months to clean up after himself and he still won't and I'm tired of doing it so clearly we just live like this now. Well, he spent the next two hours cleaning the whole apartment in silence and went to bed. And now I feel like I went too far, AITA?",36,1767255927.0,AmIOverreacting,22,0.97,False

One of the best games in the series, with arguably the most cohesive overarching narrative, every single great case contributing to the big finale. Edgeworth makes for a fantastic MC, and exploring his character and past was a treat. Seeing Franszika and Gumshoe again after so long was a delight as well.

**Assassin's Creed Origins → 6/10**

While I enjoyed the narrative and cast more than the previous 2 games in the series, they were still just decent at best on a general level. Unfortunately, the mission design and parkour elements felt like a clear step down from Unity/Syndicate.

**Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective → 9.5/10**

An excellent, tightly written adventure game brimming with style and charm. The puzzle mechanics felt fresh and satisfying to solve, the cast was wonderful, and the way the whole narrative pulled itself together at the end was beautifully done. 

**Star Ocean: The Divine Force → 7/10**

A basic but decent story paired with some fast-paced combat and a fun cast. Accelerating across the field and in battle with the DUMA system felt great despite the occasional camera issues.

**Venba → 8.5/10**

A very simple and fairly short game, but one that was incredibly emotionally resonant for me. Anyone who's ever had to leave their home and brave the challenges of a new country should give this game a shot.

**Cafe Crush → 5/10**

A short and pretty by-the-books romance visual novel with one kinda out there ending. It's never anything beyond the basic tropes, but I enjoy them, and at 2 to 3 hrs, it works out. 

**The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II → 8/10**

I love the cast of Daybreak and will always be up to spend more time with them, and on that front, DBII absolutely delivers. The character interactions and connect events (bonding events) are some of the best in the series, and the story is pretty solid for the first 2 Acts + Fragments, and the new additions to the combat improve the pace and feel nice. 

Act 3 has some interesting ideas marred by poor execution and an even poorer antagonist. Thankfully, the finale hits a lot better, highlighting the strengths of the series and delivering the best final boss yet.

**Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii → 8/10**

It's been a long time since Majima was in the driver's seat, and his second (technically 3rd) outing is a blast. The minigames, sidequests, cast and combat are all riding high, though the narrative unfortunately fumbles its pacing despite the relatively short run time.

**Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg → 7/10**

If you ever wanted an appetiser of what Atelier was like, this is the game for you. Compared to the series' modern entries, everything here is very simplified, both mechanically and narratively. However, the game still manages to nail the addictive loop of gathering, battling and crafting, and the short run time (9 to 10 hrs) hits the perfect spot for these simplified systems.

**Max Massacre → 4/10**

A free visual novel with a good plot but a poor narrative. It's short, the art is nice and, again, it's free so I don't want to go too hard on it. 

**Sayonara Wild Hearts → 8/10**

A 1 and a half hour long rhythmic fever dream that's absolutely oozing with style. Highly rec giving this a shot, even if rhythm games aren't your thing.

**Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – 8.5/10**

X is Monolithsoft at its best when it comes to world design and exploration, and pretty good in the combat department. Mira was a joy to explore, and the evolution of exploration from on-foot to mech to flight was incredibly satisfying. The sidequests are also great, a bit below XC3 for me, but a significant step up from 1 and 2. The cast and story are.. fine, considering the amount of focus the game gives them, but not a game for those who prioritise those elements.

**One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 → 6.5/10**

I like OP, I like Musou, I liked this game, though it's pretty middle of the pack for Musou games. 

**Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae → 6/10**

Pretty anime girls swinging around swords, what's not to love? This is a very low-budget indie with pretty solid combat and nothing else. Story, characterisation, more than one arena, you're looking in the wrong place. 

**Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher → 6/10**

It's like a lite (and free) Ace Attorney game with the evidence replaced by philosophy concepts. It executes its ideas decently, and if you enjoy AA's style, you'll probably like this. Though anyone who cares a lot about philosophy should probably stay away.

**Behind the Frame: The Finest Scenery → 8/10**

A gorgeous piece of art with a beautifully told narrative of love and drifting apart. The ""game"" component, so to speak, is pretty minimal, but it's still a wonderful experience. 

**Land of Screens → 7.5/10**

Another game that's minimal on the game part, Land of Screens (ironically) tells a pretty good tale about disconnecting from the digital world for a more ""analogue"" experience of life.

**A Short Hike → 7/10**

A cute but little janky platformer where you hike to the top of the mountain. 

**Final Vendetta → 5/10**

Poor man's streets of rage. 

**Pine: A Story of Loss →7/10**

A wordless yet touching tale of, well, loss that does a decent job of mechanical narrative integration with it minimal elements.

**Alba: A Wildlife Adventure →7/10**

It's like Pokémon Snap but not on rails and with actual animals. Also, a nice tale about small communities rallying together.

**Layover Lovers →7/10**

A sweet and short (and free) romance VN about a chance meeting at the airport. You can also play from either the guy's or the girl's perspective, which was a nice touch.

**Dark Deity →7/10**

Poor man's Fire Emblem, though I love Fire Emblem. It's basically Shadow Dragon but with a bit more robust storytelling, characters and combat. 

**Assassin's Creed: Rogue Remastered →6.5/10**

OG > RPG gameplay wise. Narratively, a really cool concept, but disappointingly executed. 

**Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid →6/10**

I like Power Rangers, don't care much for fighting games. An ok narrative campaign with a very low-budget presentation.

**Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry →6/10**

See Rogue.

**The Plucky Squire →7.5/10**

A very whimsical game with some cool and varied design in both 3D and 2D segments. I enjoyed the narrative, but I expected a children's storybook tale, and that's exactly what I got.

**Knack →6/10**

I expected worse for some reason, but in the end got a decently fun platformer with competent level design.

**Assassin's Creed Revelations →7/10**

This was the most cinematic of all the AC games I played this year, and Ezio is as great as always. 

**Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart →8/10**

Gorgeous, hype, electrifying and just plain fun, Rift Apart was a blast from start to finish.

**Wolfenstein: The New Order →7.5/10**

FPS games aren't really my thing, but considering the praise I'd heard for this game, especially the narrative, I gave it a shot. Gameplay-wise, I had a lot of fun despite many retries, but I can't say I was impressed with the narrative. It was good for sure, but the praise I'd heard left me feeling a tad disappointed overall. 

**Indika →7/10**

A moody and intentionally tedious game about the loss of faith. It's the exact opposite of fun, but that is very well used to embolden the themes of the narrative.

**Forspoken →6/10**

Really fun traversal, somewhat janky but overall good combat and a surprisingly cool endgame narrative twist. Also, characters exist in the game.

**Coffee Talk →8/10**

I really liked this game. While I do wish the coffee brewing part wasn't just selecting the right ingredients, the cosy atmosphere, the individual stories, and the chemistry among the cast were wonderful to experience.

**Coffee Talk: Episode 2 - Hibiscus & Butterfly →8/10**

Pretty much more of the same of that cosy, wonderful brew.

**Ghost of Yotei →8/10**

Yotei amplifies the beauty of the world that Tsushima did so well and adds greater diversity to the combat. I found the characterisation to be a step up from Tsushima, with a more focused, smaller cast, but the overall story and themes a bit run-of-the-mill.

**Mafia: The Old Country →7/10**

While the plot is pretty every mafia move, the narrative execution is quite well done. Combined with some solid gunplay and knife fighting, and you a got a pretty decent linear cinematic game.

**Pokémon Y →7/10**

It's a disappointing step down in terms of narrative from Gen 5, but as the first 3D mainline game, it manages the transition well. The 3D models and animations make the battles feel the most dynamic yet, and Mega Evolution is by far the best new mechanic to date. 

**Pokémon Legends: Z-A →8/10**

While it's a step down in terms of exploration compared to Arceus. The new real-time combat is a blast to play and adds a fast pace to the battle-focused ZA. Team MZ was a surprisingly fun crew with a solid chemistry that made up for a lack of individual development. 

As I said above, Mega Evolution was the best new mechanic the series introduced and having it back in ZA was super hype. The story was nice, and it actually helped elevate the story from XY, which was cool. 

**Dear me, I was… →7/10**

We’ve had Pacco in several training programs, and he is a very well behaved and trained. The only problem that’s lingered over the years is his lack of self assurance. Gizmo was alway friendly and at the forefront of nearly everything. They never fought or encountered any jealousy, I made sure that it was never allowed. 

When I did something, or gave anything too one, the other always got the same. Often, I say to Gizmo, let’s go find your brother, where’s Pacco. It was like a daily ritual with the two…and they came to love it. 

My wife found a Dog trainer who said he can fix Pacco confidence. Well after two, two hour sessions I must that I’m very impressed. 

The first session, week one he came over and worked with Pacco and my wife. Last week, the second session he came over with one of his dogs and introduced his dog to Pacco, in the backyard. My wife went with them for a walk and then for a car ride to a coffee shoe…Pacco Passed.

My wife’s been taking Pacco over a local park, and yesterday they actually meet another dog. Which also another positive experience. 

 

We’ll see how this Fridays training goes.

Have say he’s one hell of a REAL DOG TRAINER!

When you have status in a wolf pack then your life is set. You have privilege, you have pretty much everything you can ask for. I used to have that. Until my father, the head warrior, died protecting the Alpha and then all of a sudden we were nothing to the top pack leaders.

My mother had never really had a job before. She met her mate when she was 18 and had me, which meant she stayed home with me and dad was the worker.

That was 5 years ago now. I still wonder how my mother managed to live through the death of her mate.

She’s the strongest woman I know. Especially after having our house taken off of us, our car, our entire life taken away.

We are now ranked lower than omega’s. My mother works endless dead end jobs just to pay the overpriced bills that the Alpha has given us and to put food on the table.

But I’ve noticed the decline in my mother since my father died. She doesn’t eat as much, she works too much, she doesn’t take care of herself, and the Alpha has since passed the reins on to his son who is just as ruthless and arrogant as he was as an Alpha.

My mother just wants me to get the hell out of this pack and find my own way in life. So I don’t have to suffer the same fate.

I woke up one morning and I looked out the window from the couch that I was sleeping on and it was pouring down rain. It was going to be a really crappy day.

I rolled off the couch and stumbled to the kitchen to get a coffee when I saw some hand picked flowers sitting in a vase and a note was sitting in front of them.

Happy Birthday Morgan,

I’m sorry I can’t be there to celebrate with you. But you have a good day. You’re finally 18. I can’t believe it. You’ve grown up so quick. I love you.

Love Mom.

“Wow. Mom really loves us.” My wolf Bella said in my head.

“We already knew that.” I said.

“I know. Are you going to have anything more than just coffee?” She asked.

“Yes, actually.” I said, opening a drawer and grabbing a packet of cigarettes. And I stood next to the kitchen window of our trailer as I lit it up.

“I still can’t believe you stole those. If you get caught then you are screwed. The Alpha will throw you in the dungeon.” Bella said.

“Would you relax? No one saw me.” I said.

“Yeah. You were lucky.” She said.

I went to the bedroom where the only closet was and I started going through my half of it and I grabbed a pair of frayed jeans, a black t-shirt and black boots.

I grabbed my bag and put a raincoat on and I left the trailer that my mother and I shared.

It took us half an hour to walk to school because everyone wanted us as far out of the way as they could. So we were in the middle of nowhere, just inside the tree line with no neighbors and in an area that doesn’t get patrolled much.

When I finally got to school I felt like a drowned rat.

I took my raincoat off and put it in my locker and I started getting my books for my first class.

There were only a couple of minutes to go before I had to be there.

I heard a group of people walking down the hall towards me.

I turned to look at them and I knew all of them. Some of them were old friends of mine and some I had never wanted to be friends with at all.

Now, they all hated me since we were looked down on by omega’s. Which is a rare thing.

As the group walked past me, I was still going through my locker when the guy at the front threw his shoulder into me and I hit the side of the locker with my face.

Him and his friends started laughing as they all kept walking, but I pulled my head back and felt a little bit of blood next to my eye.

“Asshole.” I said. And the group stopped and turned back to look at me.

“What did you just call me?” Ryan asked me.

“You heard me.” I said. And he gave his bag to his friend and walked over to me. He wanted to look down on me, but since I was unusually tall at 6 foot 1, no one could really look down on me.

“You really should be careful who you talk to like that. Or maybe we could go behind the gym and see what all the fuss is about. I heard that you’d give it up to anyone just for something to eat.” He said, moving a piece of hair out of my face.

I slap his hand away and he grabs me by the arms and he slams me back into the lockers.

That’s when I noticed a crowd starting to gather around us.

“Don’t ever lay a finger on me tramp, I outrank you.” He said.

“Go to hell.” I growled in his face.

He then slapped me across the face and when I pulled my face back, I wiped my hand across my mouth and saw a little bit of blood on it.

“You little slut.” He said.

“You know your problem right now?” I asked.

“And what’s that?” He asked.

“You’re standing too close.” I said. And I headbutted him in the face and he stumbled back a few steps, letting go of my arms as he did it.

I was able to move away from the lockers and Ryan lifted his head up with blood pouring out of his nose.

“You’re in for it now.” He said, rushing me.

But I quickly stepped off to the side and grabbed him by his hair and slammed his head into the locker and then I kneed him in the stomach. As he was crouched over, I kneed him in the face and he was flat on his back after that.

His friends looked like they were going to start advancing on me, and I was ready for that. Afterall, they are wolves. And wolves hunt in packs.

“What the hell is going on down here?” A booming voice came from the other end of the hall.

Suddenly all of the onlookers scattered and it was just me and Ryan left there with a couple of Ryan’s friends.

I looked up to see Principal Grayson storming towards us.

“Shit.” I muttered to myself.

“I asked a question. What the hell is going on here?” Grayson asked again.

“Isn’t it obvious? That piece of trash attacked Ryan.” Quinn said. Ryan’s girlfriend and my ex best friend.

“Would you please get him up and take him to the nurse? He’s bleeding all over the floor?” Grayson asked his friends. So they helped him up and they got him out of there and then Grayson walked over to me and tried to stand over me as well. Trying to intimidate me.

“What do you have to say for yourself?” He asked.

“Are you going to believe anything I say?” I asked.

“Get to my office.” He demanded. So I closed my locker and I went to Grayson’s office.

I was surprised when I opened the door and Beta Levi was standing there in his three-piece suit.

Grayson walked in behind me and he bared his neck to Beta Levi out of respect. Something that I never did because I don’t respect anyone in this pack anymore. I had no reason to.

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“You’re coming with me.” Beta Levi said.

“I have class.” I said.

“Are you disobeying a direct order?” He asked.

I followed Beta Levi out of the office and we got in his car that was waiting at the front door for us.

We drove through town until we got to the packhouse and when I got out of the car I was suddenly very nervous.

I was shown inside and the packhouse looked pretty much the same as it did five years ago. The living room was off to the right, but Beta Levi took me through a couple of rooms to the left and down a hallway until we came to a large mahogany door.

He knocked on it and I heard a deep voice sing out for him to open it.

So he opened the door and I walked inside the office first, but Beta Levi shut the door behind me.

It was a pretty large office with a massive desk and Alpha Logan was sitting behind it in his finely pressed three-piece suit.

As soon as he looked up at me and I saw the firm sculpture of his face and his slicked back brown hair and green eyes staring at me, I started to feel dizzy.

The aroma of his scent finally hit me and Bella started going crazy in my head and I had to grab onto a chair to steady myself.

Suddenly all of the onlookers scattered and it was just me and Ryan left there with a couple of Ryan’s friends.

I looked up to see Principal Grayson storming towards us.

“Shit.” I muttered to myself.

“I asked a question. What the hell is going on here?” Grayson asked again.

“Isn’t it obvious? That piece of trash attacked Ryan.” Quinn said. Ryan’s girlfriend and my ex best friend.

“Would you please get him up and take him to the nurse? He’s bleeding all over the floor?” Grayson asked his friends. So they helped him up and they got him out of there and then Grayson walked over to me and tried to stand over me as well. Trying to intimidate me.

“What do you have to say for yourself?” He asked.

“Are you going to believe anything I say?” I asked.

“Get to my office.” He demanded. So I closed my locker and I went to Grayson’s office.

I was surprised when I opened the door and Beta Levi was standing there in his three-piece suit.

Grayson walked in behind me and he bared his neck to Beta Levi out of respect. Something that I never did because I don’t respect anyone in this pack anymore. I had no reason to.

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“You’re coming with me.” Beta Levi said.

“I have class.” I said.

“Are you disobeying a direct order?” He asked.

I followed Beta Levi out of the office and we got in his car that was waiting at the front door for us.

We drove through town until we got to the packhouse and when I got out of the car I was suddenly very nervous.

I was shown inside and the packhouse looked pretty much the same as it did five years ago. The living room was off to the right, but Beta Levi took me through a couple of rooms to the left and down a hallway until we came to a large mahogany door.

He knocked on it and I heard a deep voice sing out for him to open it.

So he opened the door and I walked inside the office first, but Beta Levi shut the door behind me.

It was a pretty large office with a massive desk and Alpha Logan was sitting behind it in his finely pressed three-piece suit.

As soon as he looked up at me and I saw the firm sculpture of his face and his slicked back brown hair and green eyes staring at me, I started to feel dizzy.

The aroma of his scent finally hit me and Bella started going crazy in my head and I had to grab onto a chair to steady myself.

“Mate.” I said, shocked.",1,1767255446.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
