1kbsvgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1kbsvgi/is_everyone_your_customer/,Is everyone your customer?,"I totally get it - every sale feels like a victory lap, right?

But here‚Äôs the kicker: while you‚Äôre chasing every Tom, Dick, and Harry with a wallet, you might be missing the bigger picture. You‚Äôve gotta have a vision for your business - who you want to serve, what vibe you‚Äôre building, and how you‚Äôre gonna grow without losing your sanity to stressful, unprofitable customers who make you want to pull your hair out.

So, I was chatting with a business owner yesterday, and I hit him with, ‚ÄúWhy do you keep bending over backward for customers who barely pay enough to cover your coffee?‚Äù

His answer? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want my competitors snagging them.‚Äù In my head, ""WHAT!!!!""

Maybe the competitors are hoping you take those time-suckers off their hands so they can focus on the big fish! üòè 

Here‚Äôs the deal: knowing who you are and where you‚Äôre headed (your vision) keeps you from getting dragged into the black hole of low-value clients. It‚Äôs like saying no to a bad date so you can save your energy for The One.

Stop wasting time, money, and your talent on people who don‚Äôt align with your vision and strategy.

Have you ever dealt with a customer who just wasn‚Äôt worth it? ",1,1746050932.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False
1kbsv18,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1kbsv18/i_need_to_vent/,I need to vent..,"Hi there. This might be a bit lengthy, so I‚Äôll provide a TLDR at the end. Please don‚Äôt judge me; I‚Äôm including some embarrassing or shameful details for better context.

I recently ended a five-month situationship with a guy I met online. Initially, I knew he was in a long-term relationship (a partner of 10 years) when we started talking. Despite my better judgment, I met up with him a few times to connect. I found him attractive, and he thought I was too (at least that‚Äôs what I thought). We initially bonded through sex. I understand that I‚Äôm not an angel, and I‚Äôm not perfect. I was simply seeking someone to connect with, just like he was.

Over the past five months, we would text every day on a separate message app because he wouldn‚Äôt give me his number due to his significant other. Understandable. He would always initiate the texts, asking how my day was going or expressing his excitement to meet later in the week. I would always respond, and we developed a friendship. We shared similar types of humor, interests, and other things.

The good morning texts would gradually transform into him talking to me all day. He would tell me he loved me, was obsessed with me, and considered me his best friend. He constantly talked about wanting to hang out and get lunch or coffee. However, when I would ask if he actually wanted to do something, he would make excuses why that wasn‚Äôt realistic. But then he would constantly bring it up in chats later. Over the four months we chatted, I pretty much learned all the intimate details of his life, and he learned mine. 

But there was a catch. He gave me his Reddit username to call him by, and I couldn‚Äôt know his real name. Those were the rules initially. At first, I thought this was acceptable because I thought it would only be a one-time or two-time NSA thing. However, after the second month of talking, I became more persistent in asking for his name. I believe I had every right to ask for his first name since he knew mine, and our relationship was entirely centered around his schedule. Maybe I didn‚Äôt? Perhaps I should have simply understood that even though he treated me like a friend, I should have respected the implication that this was a game on his end. 

Anyway, I eventually found out his name because his phone number was linked to the message app we were using. I simply looked it up, and it was right there. Last week, I told him that I couldn‚Äôt meet up with him unless he told me his name. He responded that it was fine, and we didn‚Äôt need to meet up anymore. That surprised me because I honestly thought he would give it to me.

I then explained to him that I knew his name because his phone was linked to the message app, and he initially freaked out. Later, he tried to message me about a completely different topic, acting as if our earlier discussion had never happened.

I tried to ignore him for the next day, but he messaged me a few times until I told him that I was tired of his narcissistic behavior and so on.

I wrote about three/four paragraphs explaining why I felt he disrespected me/use me and why I had a genuine reason to know his name. He didn‚Äôt respond to any of it until I messaged him the next morning when he told me that he wanted to move on. 

I called him on his phone number to seek clarification on why he was so quick to move on. He essentially blamed me for everything and called me crazy for typing so many words. He accused me of being overly attached and told me I needed to get a life. Out of defense, I threatened to call his girlfriend and let her know about his affairs. He responded by threatening to hurt my dog and implied that he would hurt me by setting me on fire. He continued to criticize me for my issues and loneliness. He also said I was the one that was begging to meet up with him all of the time (not the truth) and that he didn‚Äôt need me this whole time. 

I ended up calling his girlfriend and telling her about the situation because I felt so disrespected by him. She didn‚Äôt seem surprised but didn‚Äôt say much. I feel sorry for her because I believe he has her under his control and is manipulating the situation to make me look like the villain.

TLDR, I started hooking up with a guy online who also wanted to be pen pals with me. We met for four or five months. He refused to give me his name and told me he wasn‚Äôt interested in seeing me anymore when I set a boundary asking for his name last week. When I told him I knew his name, he tried to damage control but ultimately told me to leave. He then threatened me and my dog when I threatened to expose him.

1kbsu2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Medicarerecruiting/comments/1kbsu2i/move_1_be_the_medicare_messiah_host_a_workshop/,Move #1 ‚Äî Be the Medicare Messiah: Host a Workshop,"Here‚Äôs a wild idea:  
Instead of chasing cold leads who‚Äôve already ghosted 4 other agents‚Ä¶  
What if you stood in a room (or Zoom) and taught people something useful?

Workshops and webinars still convert like crazy because:

* People are confused about Medicare
* You instantly become ‚Äúthe expert in the room‚Äù just for showing up
* There‚Äôs no competition in the room except maybe the coffee pot
* And attendees are way warmer than some guy who filled out a lead form because he thought it was for free groceries

You don‚Äôt need to be Tony Robbins.  
You just need to not suck, not sell too hard, and actually help people.

**How to not overcomplicate it:**

* Book a free room at a library or senior center
* Advertise it in local Facebook groups, newsletters, or bulletin boards
* Keep the topic simple (‚ÄúMedicare 101,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat You Need to Know Before Turning 65,‚Äù etc.)
* Bring snacks. No one ever hates snacks.

Don‚Äôt worry if only 5 people show up - that‚Äôs 5 more people than you had yesterday‚Ä¶ and they all left knowing your name.

The coffee was brewed into the waste bin and the drip tray. It had a few more problems as well. The lab gave me a price to fix it, not worth it (close to the cost of a new machine), so I got a new EP0820.  
Now here's the deal, the old machine had a percentage indicator for the AquaClean filter, when it reached 0 it was time to replace it.  
The new machine, and in general, the newer line of Phillips machines have a light indicator that turns orange when it's time to replace the filter.  
When my older machine stopped working properly, the filter indicator was at 40%. It was a shame to discard a filter with almost half a tank of gas left so I installed the old filter in the new machine.   
The question is: does the machine sense something in the filter that it tells you should replace it or is it just a simple counter, after so and so cups it says to replace the filter?

1kbsqsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/redbull/comments/1kbsqsd/how_can_i_import_red_bull_for_myself/,How can I import Red bull for myself?,"As a fellow caffeine addict, I‚Äôve been getting a bit tired of coffee and more into Red Bull lately‚Äîit‚Äôs easier on the caffeine, and honestly, it tastes good. I‚Äôve been dying to try different flavors, but they don‚Äôt exist here, which is super lame considering the countries around us‚Äîliterally less than a 30-minute drive away‚Äîhave them.

We just got watermelon (for a limited time) less than a week ago, so now we finally have regular Red Bull, sugar-free, and watermelon. But unfortunately‚Ä¶ watermelon is kind of ass...

People import the flavored ones here, but the prices are ABSURD. I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying the equivalent of $6‚Äì$8 for an energy drink (since that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd spend on a coffee anyway), but it stings knowing they‚Äôre originally so much cheaper.

I am completely deflated but inflated at the same time. I am creating this post today because I can no longer feel like this anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm in this never ending turmoil of overeating low calorie foods and feeling guilty after and then feeling even more tired than I was before I ever ate. I just need help. I need help from getting out of this mess that I have dug my self into. I just want to feel normal again. I want energy. I want to be able to feel good again. I am currently laying down on the couch while typing this. I just need help. What can I do to stop overeating? I know I‚Äôm not supposed to eat until I feel hungry, and I do that. I usually feel hungry around 1:40 pm ish and that‚Äôs when I eat. But then after I eat I just feel like I can never stop. I feel so embarrassed and engulfed that I don‚Äôt seem to notice reality outside of the food itself. I have progressed a little though as I used to over indulge and get rid of it afterwards. I just need more energy and I can‚Äôt seem to reach enough to get motivated or do daily activities a teenager should be able to do effortlessly. I hardly eat any sugar and switched to stevia and allulose, and also I eat fruit like bananas and apples. For meats I usually just eat tuna or chicken. I can‚Äôt stomach much meat.

1kbsjr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1kbsjr0/i_cannot_stand_my_living_arrangement/,I CANNOT STAND MY LIVING ARRANGEMENT!,"TL;DR: a few little things like requiring my door be closed, different personalities in the shared house and different work schedules for some reason came together to make me not so functional in this place I'm renting.  But I'm moving out!

Luckily I'm moving out soon... but some damage has been done... it's been way too long living here.

Renting a room.  All I can afford in this inflated area.

It's a man who is older who rents to me.  I'm a dude, half his age.  He said he works but is off for a bit, but okay he's just been off period, morning until night watching TV in the living room.

There is a lot of stuff I have to do that requires me on my computer, including work and so I am in the place.  I also get started a bit later and work later.  So he's usually up and in front of the TV before I've left my room.  The room has a bathroom so it's pretty self sustaining to be in the room.

He has cats and requires me to shut my bedroom door always so they don't get in.  So that means when I'm in my room, I always have the door shut.  It makes me feel like a recluse.  And then I get the vibe he sort of treats me like that, like he asks me these questions all the time like he's suspicious what I'm up to.  He is giving me a very strange look when asking me that like I'm a freak.  Like if I'm not in the living room watching TV or at work, something is weird with me.

I don't want to get too ""paranoid"" but it really seems like sometimes he'll be right outside my door.  The other day he sneezed super loud, but it felt very pushed out and forced (lol) and it was right outside my door.  Or he will cough really loud right outside my door after like a long pause of silence where he paused the TV and walked near my room.

Like dude you tell me to keep the door shut.  What am I supposed to do?

So I find myself trying to change my behavior just so he isn't on me.  Like even if I should really work on my computer more in my place, I make myself leave and find a coffee shop or something.  But then I need some papers in my drawer and don't have them, or I would like to have some food and not always buy expensive caf√© stuff.

I can communicate with other people, but for some reason I struggle to communicate with him.  Anyway I'm moving out.  But even trying to get ready for the move etc, I find I'm not functioning well in the place.

Usually it's me getting up sort of late, maybe going on my phone (I know bad habit) and then it's like oh damn it's 11am or something (I work late okay!) and then it's like okay I'm kind of a weirdo freak for saying in my room this long, so I should go, and then he's weirded out by me, so I might talk, but it's like okay well I'll head out, and then I sort of leave, find a place to do my work online, but I just feel I've been wasting buckets of time.

Anyway I can't wait to have my own place again (no roommates) oh my yes!  I like roommates but something about this particular setup that is driving me insane.

1kbshw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/1kbshw1/turns_out_the_real_endgame_of_d4_was_investor/,Turns out the real endgame of D4 was investor satisfaction...,"Well, here we are again another season screaming into the void of Reddit, dissecting itemization weak mechanics, endgame (?) loops, ARPG design principles‚Ä¶ all while Blizzard sits comfortably in their ergonomic chairs sipping overpriced coffee, completely unmoved.

Because here's the sad truth: we are not the target audience. We're the vocal minority. The passionate nerds. The ones who still remember what Diablo used to be, and naively thought Diablo IV would be some sort of glorious return.

But it won't. 

And why is that? The current Blizzard strategy isn‚Äôt about pushing genre boundaries or honoring the legacy of Diablo's fucking name. It‚Äôs about predictability. It‚Äôs about minimizing risk. It‚Äôs about keeping the line going up and to the right... even if that means the game has the emotional depth of a spreadsheet.

The business model has to do two things:

1. Extract enough cash from the player base;
2. Show enough \~future potential\~ to keep investors purring like content cats.

And Diablo IV is doing exactly that. Well, if this website is not wrong, it shows that Diablo has [3 million monthly active user](https://activeplayer.io/diablo-4/)s, most of whom don't care about min-max or class balance or well done crafting systems. Blizzard has achieved the dream: a live service product that looks like a game, smells like a game, but at its core is just a very elaborate skin-delivery platform.

It's safe. It's boring. It's... stable.  
And that's all the board cares about.

Let's be honest: if you took the exact same game, removed the Diablo branding, and called it HellYeah V, it would've died faster than a hardcore character on launch day. What's keeping this thing alive is legacy inertia. Nostalgia is a hell of a drug.

Meanwhile, those of us who actually understand ARPGs, who've played Grim Dawn, Titan Quest, PoE, who are now discovering Last Epoch, sit here wondering how basic genre-defining features are still missing. This isn't rocket science. It's not even clever-Steve-Jobs-design. It's just... expected stuff. And yet here we are.

Blizzard's confirmed roadmap tells the whole story: a carefully controlled trickle of content to justify just enough engagement. A skeleton crew to maintain costs. A slow, steady drip of ‚Äúlive service‚Äù sedation to keep the masses sedated and the investors smiling.

It's business efficient.  
It's cynical.  
It's... soul-crushing.

So yeah, maybe it's time to let go. Maybe we should stop hoping the Diablo we loved will magically return. Maybe we should stop writing impassioned essays no one at Blizzard will read. Maybe it's time to accept that the franchise moved on and left us behind.

I didn't want to leave. But it turns out, I was no longer invited to stay.

RIP Diablo. We had some great times. I'll always remember you for who you used to be.

Due to some family obligations, I have relocated to North Carolina, near Charlotte, and I'm on month eight. I've been visiting Charlotte for many years before this and living around the area is much different than visiting. It's not for me. It's made me appreciate what I actually want versus don't. I bolded things for quicker reading because part of this is vent, so bear with my novel. I've narrowed down the state I'd like to live in most, it's just a matter of if my list fits! I'd prefer a Northeast state, it's what I know and love...but anyone else can chime in if my list fits!

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* 

*Wants*:

\-**A sizable amount of houses under 300k on the market/and a medium cost of living**. I also like a bit of land with a house, so the more houses on 2-4 acres of land in the market, the better (which I do know there's more of those on the Pittsburgh side than the Philly side). State parks are also a plus. The market and COL changes often, but the '300k' is a loose parameter. 

**-Amenities that aren't over a 35 minute drive from the city**, and **a good public transit system** if they are. Shops, CVS's/Walgreens, Coffee shops perhaps, doctor offices, UPS stores, etc. It would be ideal if all these things weren't concentrated in just the main cities, but for towns and smaller cities to have them as well. 

\-**Mountains**! I don't have to be *in* the mountains, but close-ish proximity to them makes me very happy. I don't care about having snow but I'd like proper cold winter. I'm used to it. 

\-**A state not offended by having people from New York- or anywhere- living there. Diversity**. Despite Charlotte and the Triangle being welcoming, NC doesn't care for 'outsiders'- it's prevalent in and outside of online spaces and in politics/politicians here unfortunately. **I do not want a state that lives in a bubble**. I am also LGBTQ which I'd like to feel more comfortable walking around.. 

\-**Weekly fun events all around the city or outside of it.** I'm not always an extrovert who hangs out, BUT I still like to see 'life' in towns and cities. Having a mix of cultures and a 'city vibe' brings me joy! Oh...and please, some good Chinese food or pizza would be nice (bagels..eh I can take or leave it). It's hard to find those things outside of Charlotte, and I've tried a lot. Chinese food especially. 



*Deal Breakers/Don't Wants:*

\-The first week of April this year in NC we had a near/at 90F day. **I don't want ""summer"" (consistent 80/90F) starting in April**. My biggest gripe to date! I would like my falls and springs to be more in the 50F's-60F's. Winter and snow do not bother me, I prefer it...though I prefer 'cold as hell' over snow sometimes. Either way I'll deal with snow if need be. 

\-NC is a red state. There are no worker unions or protections here, which, having been apart of the New York Teachers Union, **I do not want a red state** that constricts workers rights so tightly, nor women's rights which I may need. 

\-**I don't want to have to drive 35 minutes to get to anywhere 'useful'.** There is a huge lack of towns with basic amenities outside of charlotte- minus the obvious and perhaps only bustling area: Mooresville/the Lake Norman Area or Hickory. Many towns around Charlotte and NC, especially heading north, are a bit dilapidated and barren. Statesville is a prime example with a mall and huge potential shopping center that's been abandoned for years. 

\-**I don't want all highway driving- various routes to a destination is ideal.** NC lacks a good road system. You have to take the highway if you want to get anywhere, which means if something happens on the highway, you are forced to be stuck in traffic. Where I lived in NY, you could 'take the streets' and avoid the highway if needed for at least some of the trip. That's near impossible to do in NC. Please note, this is not the highest priority for me! I'll drive highways if a state has everything else I'd want!  

\- The pollen here is terrible- I've never seen it rain pollen before I lived in NC- and I am not exaggerating. I don't suffer from allergies bad, but I'm tired of constantly cleaning the yellow-ness of windows and cars**. A short 'pollen' season**.

\-As a NYer....I am sorry, but **New Jersey is a no. Upstate New York a maybe-probably no.** I've been there for a few years  (Fredonia), and the expense is still quite costly for a house with 2-4 acres of land- more than PA (so I'm not seeing an incentive, but maybe you can find one). I find back that way is a bit less diverse aside from the major cities like Buffalo, for example. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*  
I've had the chance to talk to some PA residents who didn't have anything terrible to say- at least not up front. So as a lurker in this sub, I've decided to see what some of you think. I do have a few other wants but they are more suited around my hobbies. So although they are important in a way, they do not affect the main list here.",2,1746049952.0,SameGrassButGreener,0,1.0,False

Husband works construction and when he has work 4-5 days a week, we're solid. Problem is the jobs are slower right now so I'm looking to pick up part time work, this is complicated by our lack of childcare for our 10 year old and 2 year old. 

I was mulling this over today, how my work hours are basically restricted to evenings/weekends so my husband can be home when I'm gone. 

And then it hit me that food service is probably my best bet at the moment.

Trouble is my only food experience is in coffee shops and a deli I worked at for a couple of years on a local college campus. I know I can hustle, the deli and coffee shops were brutal during football season especially, and I know I can learn the menu/job itself. 

My hold up is... where is the best place to apply to learn the basics? Should I look at popular chains like Wild Wings Cafe, Olive Garden, etc. Just to get the general practices down and have something on my resume? 

Or should I focus more on locally owned spots? They always seem more intimidating to me somehow? I guess because I live in a relatively small Alabama town and I worry that making a bad impression with small business owners can hurt my chances of future employment once I've really gotten my feet wet again.

So far I've applied at two sushi places and a taco joint. I was curious as to whether anyone had any advice one way or the other before going in for the big chain places. ",1,1746049904.0,Serverlife,0,1.0,False

Should I give more signs?","So I'm trying to find out two things, on the one hand I want to find out if my neighbor girl likes me. And I also want to find out if she knows that I like her. The first thing is what I would love to know, the second thing seems more important for my chances to not get friendzoned I guess? I guess I want her to know but I don't want to straight up tell her this yet until we had more one on one time.

So a bit of backstory: I moved to a new apartment a month ago, while moving she walked out of her door and asked me if I was moving, then we had a short chat and went our ways. About two weeks later I ran into her while moving a bed I bought from a friend (in the same apartment complex), she recognised me and started a little chat again, I was already planning to ask her for a coffee at my place, but since I was with my friend and she was ringing her friends doorbell it felt like the wrong time.

So 2 days later I decided to go for an all or nothing, I knocked on her door and invited her for a coffee. She responded friendly and said something like ""how nice, I'd like to"" and in this conversation she mentioned she was looking forward to it. After this we chatted about our cats and went our way again. 

While meeting we were constantly talking about whatever and I had a great time. However I didnt notice any signs of any further interest, which I'm pretty bad at anyway. She did ask me if I was living together with the friend I mentioned earlier, because she sees us together at my balcony a lot (I assume she was checking if I'm gay lmao). 
Anyway, the night passes and after about two hours she had to go because she had work the day after, and told me I could just call from my balcony if I wanted to meet her cats.

So I felt like I needed to hint my attraction to her for some reason (I guess I was overthinking) and the day after added her on instagram which she didnt accept yet (two days after that now) yesterday (two days after meeting) I chatted with her across the balcony, and because she told me she was free for the week and I am too I asked if I could come over sometime this week, her reply: yes maybe, I'd have to think about it, to which I replied: alright, we'll see.
I thought I came of as too eager so I decided to be quiet for the coming week, however she did call me from her balcony today for a quick chat.

So anyway, I'm in doubt about a lot of thing. Shes very outgoing and talks to lots of people, usually is pretty chatty and she mentioned being over at another neighbours apartment too (to let her cat chase away their mice). This is why I'm not sure if she's at least somewhat interested. 

Also I feel like shes oblivious to the fact that I like her and is simply being friendly to a neighbour who's friendly to her. When she was at my place I didnt make any moves but I did try to ask her about herself, stare in her eyes a little bit too long, etc. 

This is getting way too long ready so I'll conclude:
Is it likely she knows I'm interested? 
Do you guys think she is interested? 
Should I try to make it more obvious that I'm interested?",1,1746049717.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1kbse7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kbse7e/can_the_nuova_simonelli_oscar_ii_espresso_machine/,Can the Nuova Simonelli Oscar II Espresso Machine Deliver a Perfect Brew? Review,"The Nuova Simonelli Oscar II Pour-Over Espresso Machine is a product I‚Äôve been putting through its paces for the past month, using it nearly every day. As someone who enjoys a quality espresso and dabbles in coffee artistry, this machine has been in the spotlight in both my home setup and occasional small gatherings with friends. It‚Äôs marketed as a professional-grade espresso maker designed to fit a variety of spaces, from home kitchens to small coffee shops, and I was eager to see if it could live up to its promises.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this espresso machine was its build quality. Sporting a retro design with stainless steel accents and a vibrant red finish, it‚Äôs not just functional but also a conversation starter. The stainless steel gives it a robust and solid feel, leaving little room for doubts about durability. Standing at 20.5 x 16 x 22 inches and weighing in at 52 pounds, it‚Äôs a hefty appliance but fits perfectly on a standard countertop. While compact enough for a home kitchen, it still manages to exude the aura of professional equipment.

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
As performance was a major selling point for me, I tested the machine‚Äôs capability to produce caf√©-quality espressos‚Äîand it delivered. The thermo-compensated brewing unit ensures consistent temperature, noticeably improving extractions. I never experienced fluctuations, and every shot had that rich crema coffee enthusiasts love. The steaming wand was another highlight, handling almond milk and oat milk effortlessly, creating foam textures that rival high-end coffee shops.

**Highlights**  
- The coffee extraction is consistent, thanks to its advanced brewing system.  
- Professional-quality steam wand for crafting exquisite milk-based drinks such as cappuccinos and lattes.  
- Compact yet powerful, suitable for smaller spaces without compromising performance.  
- Option to use a reservoir or connect directly to a water line adds to its versatility.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Having used semi-automatic espresso machines before, I found this one fairly easy to operate, even with its manual operation mode. It's suitable for someone who enjoys the process of brewing coffee. However, maintenance is where it gets slightly challenging. Backflushing the machine regularly is recommended, and I had to replace some gaskets in the brew head after the first month. These minor tasks might seem daunting for beginners, although I personally didn‚Äôt mind the extra care.

**Disadvantages**  
- Regular maintenance, including gasket replacements, requires attention.  
- The manual operation may not be suitable for those looking for convenience over control.  
- Some users have reported instances of the machine breaking down early, although I didn‚Äôt encounter any major issues during my usage.  

**Challengers**  
When considering semi-automatic espresso machines, two common competitors to this model are the Breville Barista Express and the Rancilio Silvia. Having tested these before, I can confidently say the Oscar II holds its ground. Unlike the Breville, which includes a built-in grinder, the Oscar II relies on the user to invest in a separate quality grinder. However, its steam wand performs significantly better than either competitor, producing silky microfoam every time. The Rancilio Silvia, while similarly professional, is slightly less forgiving for beginners due to its steeper learning curve.

**Quality for Price**  
While no espresso machine in this category is what you'd consider budget-friendly, I felt the features of the Nuova Simonelli Oscar II justified the cost. It‚Äôs an investment in quality, both in terms of its robust build and its consistent performance. For those who appreciate the craft of making espresso and want a machine that offers a professional experience, this is worth the price. If you‚Äôre just entering the world of espresso making, you might find the cost higher than expected and want to consider a simpler machine.

1kbs9oe,https://www.reddit.com/r/exAdventist/comments/1kbs9oe/was_never_really_a_sda_carrying_the_guilt_anyway/,"Was never really a SDA, carrying the guilt anyway","Hi! 

I‚Äôm a long time lurker, and a first time poster. I decided to finally go ahead and make an account to rant and engage a bit. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve been reading everyone‚Äôs stories and I‚Äôve realized I feel a bit like an outsider ‚Äî for example, all I remember about Ellen White was that her name got thrown around a lot, she was blind and had visions (right?), and that my mum once gave me her book (which I have never opened and put in the farthest corner of my closet). 

Let me explain. I was born into an Adventist family, that‚Äôs all I knew, but for some reason it never clicked for me. Once a week I was forced to go to church, and then I was free again. Church was boring, almost felt corporate. I hated the songs, I felt like the adults were way too into the stories, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to make any questions, the Bible was impossible to understand and the general energy was just horrible. Oh how I hated the smell of church. Not the actual smell, but like the vibe of it. To this day, I still swear I can smell ‚Äúchurch‚Äù on my parents every Saturday.

Even as young as 4, religion was my secret. One time I remember my mum inviting my friend to church, and I felt betrayed. How dare she?! My friend wasn‚Äôt supposed to know, it was a part of my life I carefully hid from everybody. It got even worse when I went to school and history classes begun. I was terrified, thinking, ‚ÄúWhat if they‚Äôll bring up Christianity and someone will point at me?!‚Äù I guess it‚Äôs worth to mention that I am from one of the least religious countries, so being bullied for being religious was probably a valid fear.

Anyway, I dutifully did my weekly jail sentence until I reached about 9-10 and for the first time in my life asked myself, ‚ÄúWhat do I actually believe in?‚Äù I remember thinking that no one had ever actually asked me, I was told God exists as if it‚Äôs a fact, and when I had questions, like why is fearing him a good thing, I was told to sit and shut up. So it seemed almost funny that no one ever asked me what do I think. I quickly realized I didn‚Äôt believe in God. I think I figured that out before Santa. Well, to be fair, why would a kid want to question Santa? 

So after my conclusion, hell started. I waited maybe a year before confessing to my parents because I was terrified. I got your usual yelling, screaming, ‚Äúthe Devil is in you!‚Äù stuff. Your run-of-the-mill emotional blackmail (if you go to church you‚Äôre allowed to see your friends in your free time) and guilt tripping. It took time, patience and pain to get through it, but slowly, year after year, they left me alone. It must‚Äôve taken like 6-7+ years though. 

The thing is, those early years fucked me up. All those rules, the rules I didn‚Äôt understand, ended up biting me in the ass. I still remember the first time I ‚Äúdisobeyed‚Äù, when I went to the store on a Saturday. I think I was like 8. I felt so guilty for so long, but yet, it was freeing. Then I tried coffee. Pork. TV and music on a Saturday. I took God‚Äôs name in vain. I read the Harry Potter series in secret. But slowly, as the years went on, the rules I started breaking were the more serious ones. I got a piercing. My mum cried. Then I got another one. And I kept going. Smoking, drinking. I was 14/15, drinking vodka at 8am at school. I was eating 3-4 nutmegs (like, the entire nut) to get high, because that was the only ‚Äúdrug‚Äù I had access to. Everything they told me not to do, I had to do. Because for so long my life was just rules, rules, rules‚Ä¶ But soon it turned into self harm, depression, and soon attempts at suicide. I moved away from my parents at 16, hoping for a new beginning, but it just got worse. I discovered I could do whatever I want anytime I want. So I dropped out of school and spent my money on alcohol and cigarettes, and moved abroad at 17. It got a bit better before it got worse again.

Years went by, and I kept moving countries to run away from myself. At 19 I discovered cocaine. And mixing cocaine with other drugs. During that time my binge drinking reached a new high. I drank about 15 pints every day on average, snorted drugs left and right. I would party non stop for days without sleeping. There was not a single sober day in about a year. Eventually I got fired because I kept sleeping in, missed work and then later the same day I‚Äôd be at the pub, drunk again. I also worked at that same pub, lol. One day I stopped cold turkey and the next few days were the worst I have ever experienced. Probably the closest I‚Äôve been to dying, too. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I kept hallucinating, I thought I was going into a cardiac arrest (I also have a heart disease, which doesn‚Äôt help). I was this close to joining an AA group, but saw that they were all religious, and dipped.

Anyway, luckily I got through it. Now I‚Äôm only addicted to coffee and cigarettes, and I‚Äôll take those addictions over all else I‚Äôve dabbled with.  Alcohol is a bit of a weak point for me still, but I make sure to not drink over 4 beers at once, and not more than once a week. Luckily I am able to have casual drinks, and can limit myself. 

Sorry, guys, my point was not to tell my entire life story (although that‚Äôs more or less exactly what I did), but to vent and I guess to get off my chest how much harm religion can really do when it‚Äôs forced upon you. If only my parents accepted that I didn‚Äôt believe and just let me be, I think it would all be so different. But my point also, I guess, is that I don‚Äôt feel like I quite fit in this group, either. I never believed, I never actually took part of church. I don‚Äôt know what you guys are talking about in most of these posts. So am I a former Adventist, really? I guess yes, and also no. But I do feel affected by it. I hope this story resonates with someone, and that together we can push through. If someone has any advice for forgetting, forgiving, and moving on, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. I wish I could be neutral about religion, but all I feel is hate.

So far ive made about 8 different batches. The coffee grounds I am using are Amazon's Columbia Medium Roast so I know they arent the best but I dont want to waste good beans while figuring this out. I first started off using cold  a 1/5 ratio with about a 24hr brew period in the fridge using a nut milk bag to filter and. The taste was way to bitter. (I honestly cant really tell if its more bitter or sour, either way its awful). Anyways ive also tried, room temp  brewing, 12hr-18hr brew period, finer grind, 1/10 ratio etc and I cant seem to get rid of the bitter or off putting taste. Any suggestions of what I might be doing wrong?

1kbs2ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/IfailedNCLEX/comments/1kbs2ha/the_courage_to_share_telling_your_friends_you/,The Courage to Share: Telling Your Friends You Failed the NCLEX!,"Allow me to share with this community how my friend called Sofia got the courage to share with her friends after failing NCLEX.

Sofia sat at her kitchen table, staring at the email on her laptop screen. The words ""Did Not Pass"" glared back at her, each syllable a tiny jab to her heart. She‚Äôd spent months studying for the NCLEX, sacrificing weekends, late nights, and countless cups of coffee to prepare for the nursing licensure exam. Her friends had cheered her on, sending encouraging texts and even dropping off study snacks. Now, the weight of letting them down or so she thought, settled heavily on her shoulders.

She knew she had to tell them. They‚Äôd been her biggest supporters, and hiding the truth felt dishonest. But how do you admit something that feels so raw, so personal? Sofia took a deep breath, grabbed her phone, and started planning. She didn‚Äôt want this to be a pity party, she wanted to own her story and move forward. Here‚Äôs how she did it.

Sofia decided to invite her closest friends; Lila, Marcus, and Priya over for a casual pizza night. She didn‚Äôt want to make a big announcement over text or in a public setting where she‚Äôd feel exposed. She texted the group: ‚ÄúHey, pizza at my place Saturday? Need some friend time.‚Äù They all agreed, excited for a low-key hangout.

When her friends arrived, they laughed and joked as they grabbed slices of pizza and sprawled across her couch. Sofia let the conversation flow naturally for a bit, enjoying their stories about work and dating mishaps. Then, during a lull, she took a sip of soda and said, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve got something to share.‚Äù Her friends turned to her, their faces curious but open. She took a deep breath and went for it.

‚ÄúGuys, I got my NCLEX results, and I didn‚Äôt pass this time. It‚Äôs honestly pretty disappointing i worked so hard, and I thought I was ready. But I‚Äôm already signing up to retake it, and I‚Äôm figuring out what I need to study differently. I just wanted to be upfront with you because you‚Äôve all been so supportive.‚Äù The room was quiet for a moment, and Sofia‚Äôs stomach twisted.

Lila was the first to speak. ‚ÄúSof, that‚Äôs tough, but you‚Äôre so freaking determined. You‚Äôre gonna crush it next time.‚Äù Marcus nodded, adding, ‚ÄúYeah, failing a test doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not a great nurse. You‚Äôve got this.‚Äù Priya reached over and squeezed her hand. ‚ÄúThanks for telling us. How can we help you study for round two?‚Äù

Sofia felt a wave of relief. They didn‚Äôt try to fix it or shower her with pity, they listened and believed in her. She hadn‚Äôt expected them to solve her problem; she just needed them to know where she was at. Their responses weren‚Äôt perfect, but they were genuine, and that was enough.

The conversation shifted as Sofia shared her plan to join a study group and use a new preparation course. Her friends chimed in with ideas, Marcus even offered to quiz her with flashcards. By the end of the night, they were laughing again, planning a celebratory dinner for when she‚Äôd pass the NCLEX in a few months. Sofia felt lighter, like the failure wasn‚Äôt a secret she had to carry alone anymore.

Weeks later, Sofia stuck to her study plan, leaning on her friends when she needed encouragement. She‚Äôd text them after a long study session, and they‚Äôd send back memes or words of hype. When she retook the NCLEX, she passed. The pizza night celebration that followed was louder and messier than the first, with her friends toasting to her resilience.

Looking back, Sofia realized that telling her friends about failing the NCLEX wasn‚Äôt just about sharing bad news, it was about letting them into her journey. It was scary, but it made her stronger, and it reminded her that true friends don‚Äôt judge you for stumbling; they help you get back up.

Future USRN failing the NCLEX doesn‚Äôt define you. Sharing that failure with friends takes guts, but it can deepen your bonds and remind you that you‚Äôre not alone. Be honest, be clear about your next steps, and let their support carry you forward. You‚Äôve got this, and so do they.",6,1746048885.0,IfailedNCLEX,5,1.0,False

Started off slow with the back and forth responses but it was building up. The replies became very long and then we moved it to WhatsApp after 5 days. Over the last two days we've had 1 hour phone call conversations on each day and just always texting and there's lots of humour and subtle flirting - it's not overly flirty because we both wanted to keep it a little classy and take it slow. 

Haven't planned to meet because we've both been busy this week, but after the weekend, I'm planning to ask her on a coffee date to see how our in person chemistry is.

She's out of my league in terms of looks, but she has mentioned she feels like I'm smart/funny/intelligent and she thinks I'm out of her league (I'm not, she's very smart and I find her unreal). Now ik some might tell me not to sell myself short but I don't want to oversell either

I've been single for 4 years since my ex kinda left a pretty high benchmark and it's been hard to commit to anybody because I always tend to feel like I can do better (although I believe I just got lucky with my ex - ended mutually because of me travelling to a different country)

It's been hard and I don't want to have too high of a hope for this but I can't help being excited about how it unfolds 

I usually like to meet much earlier before investing this much time and effort into texting/phone calls but I couldn't help myself she was too flattering. She seems super genuine. I haven't swiped on bumble or really responded to anyone else since the 2nd/3rd day of talking to her and I plan on deleting it

So, I‚Äôve recently moved back to my hometown. I have to stay for a while and I‚Äôm really bored. I think this is a good time to make some nice new internet friends! The problem is I don‚Äôt love being on my phone and want to avoid having a lot of same-y conversations that might not lead to much.¬†

So to make things more fun and hopefully get to talk to people I have things in common with and could have a real friendship with, I‚Äôve made a little quiz! It might help us see if we have common interests and similar ideas about friendship, and maybe it could spark some fun conversations. I‚Äôll link it below for anyone interested. It‚Äôs pretty short but if you start it and feel like we might not be a good fit, feel free to abort mission - I won‚Äôt be offended!¬†

To give you a little intro to me, I like reading, cooking, watching movies and TV, iced coffee, taking care of my plants, thrifting and interesting people. I used to write creatively but I‚Äôm having a hard time with it lately, hoping to get back into it. I don‚Äôt like video games, anime/manga, sports and people who are mean.¬†

Finally, I just want to make it clear that this is about friendship and I‚Äôd most like to talk to girls/women, but I‚Äôm totally open to guy friends if we have things in common and are on the same page (i.e. a platonic one) üòä

I have a question about something I personally experience and am trying to figure out if it's because of my BPD or if I have a deeper issue here.

Basically I can't stand when a stranger gets physically close to me. In line for coffee and a lady stands too close to me? I move as far away as possible immediately. At the grocery store and someone reaches over me to get an item? I get so mad and have even snapped that they need to back up or just say excuse me and I can move. 

The worse is that I live in New York and obviously people sit next to me/ behind me on the train. When this happens I either immediately get up and stand or move seats. It makes me feel like a total freak and I've seen people get offended/eyeing me when I create distance.


And don't get me started on strangers randomly tapping or touching me üò≠üò≠ I'm like one hair away from losing it..

Is this because of BPD or am I just weird? For context I grew up in a household where we had no sense of privacy or boundaries. My mom would literally walk into the bathroom while I was showering or using the toilet, she still does it and I'm 31. It's so frustrating and I've expressed it bothers me but she doesn't understand the concept. I think this is the reason why strangers getting physically close freaks me out but I'm so extra about it...is it normal to this degree?

I finished my games almost 1-2 month after the release, today opened up the game after leaving it for such a long time and it brought a lot of memories and wanted to share here  
  
**Few mistakes I made:** 

\- at first didn't cared about spaghetti but slowly when I reached the endgame, I started regretting my decision as it started to become hurdle on my design and cleanup was PITA  
  
\- didn't knew about world grid soon, completely F'ed up my train, when I reached my second base with train those two foundation grid looked awful and I was in tears  
  
\- Should have used blueprint a lot since the moment I unlocked it, it is too powerful and I know it is a ""YOU issue""  
  
\- Should have used QOL mods like ""infinite nudge/zoop"", a lot of times I have just given up on verticality due to nudge issues  
  
\- Should have used trains more, they really clean up the base and provide free power delivery  
  
\- Should have unlocked alternate recipes sooner, a lot of times I had to completely dismantle a huge factory and rebuild it due to new good recipe.  
  
  
**What made me feel good:**   
  
\- A.D.A, for sure. She always was there to humor me and the conversation between her and the planet every time I interacted with mercer sphere

\- Those friendly reminders after 6 hours of play to take a break

\- Boombox, the music just were good behind the concentration  
  
\- First rifle, finally spiders were my worthy opponent  
  
\- Sprint, jump, slide, jump, repeat  
  
\- Snutt and jace videos  
  
\-  Seeing those power production meter go up  
  
\- Microbreaks  
  
\- Almost no crashes whatsoever on my whole gameplay  
  
\- The ending, it was just wow   


**What made me feel bad:**  
  
\- spiders (specially those giants one and ones near radiation zones with poison sting)  
\- running back to base half way across the map to get the items(it was before dimentional depo was a thing)  
  
\- Jetpack running out of fuel mid way through and realizing I don't have a parachute  
  
\- Trucks never became useful to me, I tried my best but I feel bad about them. Having a vehicle transportation plus burden of managing fuel for every factory never gave me an opportunity to use them  
  
\- Cables, I don't like power poles and million cables around my base. I hope they have daisy chain mechanism built in, though I never used mods that interfere with game mechanics.

1kbrt2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1kbrt2k/could_the_proctor_silex_2slice_toaster_be_the/,Could the Proctor Silex 2-Slice Toaster be the ultimate kitchen upgrade? Review inside!,"The Proctor Silex 22305 2-Slice Toaster has been a surprising addition to my kitchen routine. I never thought I'd have so much to say about a toaster of all things, but here we are. Testing it daily for a few weeks has made me quite familiar with everything this compact toaster has to offer. From bagels to slices of sourdough, it‚Äôs been toasting up a storm. While I am mostly satisfied, there are some quirks worth considering before making it your countertop companion.

**Compact and Functional Design**  
This toaster is a pretty sleek little appliance, with its plastic exterior in a matte black finish. Measuring 7‚ÄùD x 8‚ÄùW x 12‚ÄùH, it doesn‚Äôt hog countertop space, which is a blessing for kitchens like mine that are already crammed with gadgets. The cool-touch walls are not just a selling point but an actual lifesaver when your clumsy hands (like mine pre-coffee!) graze the sides. It weighs just 2.2 pounds, making it easy to store in a cabinet when not in use. The built-in cord wrap tidies things up perfectly‚Äîa feature I didn‚Äôt even know I needed until now.  

**Extra-Wide Slots Make Breakfast a Breeze**  
Toast lovers know the pain of forcing a thick slice of artisan bread into a standard toaster. That‚Äôs not a problem here, thanks to its generous extra-wide slots. Whether it‚Äôs fluffy bagels or chunky Texas toast, everything slides in effortlessly. And the Toast Boost feature is genuinely clever; it nudges smaller items like English muffins or thin bread slices up higher, which means no more fishing around with a fork and risking your life just to get your snack.

[Curious about Proctor Silex 22305? Check Amazon for pricing now.](https://chpizza.com/p/b09g8jfdp9/)

**Variable Settings and Toasting Options**  
Adjusting the toast to your preferred crunchiness is where this toaster shines. The seven toast settings vary from merely warmed-up bread to the kind of crispy perfection you‚Äôll only find in your dreams. I tested every setting as I worked my way through different types of bread and found the results to be both consistent and satisfying. The cancel button is a minor convenience I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd use, but it‚Äôs handy when I‚Äôve accidentally chosen a setting a bit too hot. However, the toasting process, at times, feels longer compared to other models I‚Äôve used.

**Maintenance and Cleanliness**  
Cleaning up has been remarkably simple. With its removable crumb tray, there‚Äôs no need to awkwardly shake the toaster upside-down over your sink. I have a habit of making a mess while toasting bagels, but this toaster is forgiving‚Äîit catches all the crumbs neatly and takes just a few seconds to empty out. It‚Äôs a small detail, but it adds to the overall convenience.

**Advantages**  
- Toast Boost makes retrieving smaller slices hassle-free.  
- Wide slots accommodate thick bread and bagels easily.  
- Cool-touch exterior ensures safety during busy mornings.  
- Seven browning levels offer great customization for all kinds of toast.  

**Negative Attributes**  
- Toasting can sometimes feel slower than other toasters.  
- The plastic exterior, while lightweight, doesn‚Äôt feel particularly premium.  

**Comparing to Peer Products**  
Before deciding on the Proctor Silex 22305, I did some research and compared it to competitors like the Cuisinart CPT-122 and the BLACK+DECKER TR3500SD. The Cuisinart model is known for its stainless-steel body and dual-control options, giving it a more premium look and advanced functionality. However, its narrow slots are limiting for thicker bread lovers. The BLACK+DECKER option stands out with its fast toasting times but lacks the Toast Boost function, making it tricky to fish out smaller slices. In contrast, the Proctor Silex toaster combines wide slots with boosted functionality while maintaining a wallet-friendly price. Sure, it doesn‚Äôt have the high-end finish of some rivals, but it handles the basics exceptionally well.

**Affordable Quality**  
Priced reasonably compared to its peers, this toaster balances functionality with affordability. In a world of overpriced appliances, this gadget proves you don‚Äôt have to overspend for solid performance. While it doesn‚Äôt boast fancy designs or groundbreaking features, it excels at the essentials for half the cost of premium models.

**Controversies you may not like (please don't judge)**

**1) Yes there are female villains who will be killed, its 2025, it's ""gender equality""**

**2)The story takes place in foreign land so outside people can be attracted to it**

**3) This has to be a bridge and connect older Indian 1 lovers to gen z and is like compensation for Indian 2's flop. Hence highlights misandry (false rape cases) recent worldwide surge of racism to Indians (especially Indian men). But whole story is not just that, it has action and etc. Foreign locations include London and New York.**

**4) It is not completely new but it is connected to the Indian 3 trailer but with a new twist. The universal thing is Senapathy performs marmakala on specific set of people.**

**5) I phrased it in English, Im an NRI, telugu person so I have no idea of tamil Im sorry but Im a fan of the Indian(Bharateeyudu) series.**

**6) And finally, we are living in 2025, nowadays people want drama, excitement, controversy, not killing some old rich tamil businessmen called ""evil"". We need to highlight struglles of indian hindu men, and make it appealing to the global audience.**

**Who are the villains?(actors/actress I imagined for the villains)**

**Isabella (A hot hollywood actress who is extremely racist towards indian men and ruins a tamil boy's life) -Sabrina Carpenter**

**Reggie (Roadmen from the streets of London, who kills an NRI student admitted to Oxford University from India) - Jamie Foxx (He is originally not supposed to be killed but he taunts Senapathy and kills an indian boy in front of him)**

**Viktor(Drug Syndicate Leader in UK but causes huge unrest to Indian politicians and hence financial loss for India (you guys please continue on this) - Jason Momoa**

**Lara(British Hacker who hacks Indian banks and works for SJ Suryah, she knows Marmakala too, and is a tough opponent, she hacks Indian banks and benefits SJ Suryah) - Hayley Atwell**

**SJ Suryah(Final Villain) - Knows marmakala**

**From start to end, I will explain it, please make it viral. Im praying to Lord Hanuman and Lord Krishna for their blessings. And also please rate it. (By the way, this is just to highlight modern problems, racism and all. If any modern slang like ""pajeet"" offends you, I truly apologize but I had to add it in for the movie.**

**First villain Murder**

So the movie starts of in Ibiza, there is a sexy item song with Isabella, (sunny afternoon in beaches, microbikini girls twerking kissing, etc, lollipop sucked by Isabella, etc, yatch dance, and night dance in club, think of Kissik but better with alcohol), then after the dance she has an indian assistant (a dark skinned tamil man), she slaps him hard because when he said her trailer is ready, its not echo proof meaning people can still hear outside what is happening. So by the time she reaches India, (keep in mind she is only going to India for a bollywood thing not to live there) she says to her assisant ""God I can't wait to get out of that shithole after my signature"".

So anyways she is in her private jet when her agent says ""Mam, this Senapathy guy is still alive, and he... has a reputation for killing those he deems ""unworthy"". A slight shock appears on Isabella's face and coincidentally a turbulence happens in the private jet. The camera zooms out quickly into the blue sky and in cloudy letters. It is phrased ""INDIAN 3 (WAR MODE)"" as sunlight is shining on the letters, with insane Souraa + Come Back Indian BGM. And then zooms back into the private jet and then she mocks him saying ""What have I did wrong? Im just telling the truth about Indians especially their men, they are just ""ugly shitskin pajeets"" and laughs. She lands in India, then as usual racist, next taxi driver with car scene, boring bits but yea, she arrives in her trailer does makeup etc. But now a boy(13M) called¬†**Subarao**¬†who is bullied for being a huge fan of her, is introduced. He is dark skinned etc, and poor, he is bullied saying ""Isabella will never even lift her eye for you"" etc, but anyways as guards are stopping the crowd he runs for her and offers her a gift and sweets. She gets insanely mad slaps him but frames it as he is trying to ""sexually abuse her"", news is leaked and he is bullied even more in school, and so on, but Senapathy spots him as he is trying to commit sucide and stops him, saying he ""knew he didn't do anything wrong"" (contrasts to killing his son in Indian 1), as Isabella enters her trailer again, and locks the door and throws it, Senapathy catches it, and looking at a bikini picture of her says ""You look hot here, but I doubt if this is any hot compared to the hell you will go to"", she screams and shouts but she remembers she slapped another tamil man in Ibiza for an ""echo proof caravan"" to be arranged. She tries to seduce him which fails and says ""You won't kill a woman would you? Isn't it against your code?"" He replies ""You asked for gender equality, justice sees no gender"" and performs Marmakala on her, as her face falls on dog shit, it highlights the contrast and he says ""Shit... skin"" and the insane bgm starts. Then in LA her death causes a huge struggle. Anyways then Senapathy goes to London to kill Viktor (Jason Momoa), while LA police, hollywood and indian police, don't suspect Senapathy for Isabella's death. Because they think ""Why would Senapathy kill a woman? And that too she didn't do anything harmful to the nation"". The authorities swear, they will ""catch the killer and make him pay""

**Second villain Murder**

Now Senapathy goes to London to kill Viktor originally, but the plan changes. It is rainy as usual, and basically as he walks, Senapathy is still wanted, but this is only in India, but still Senapathy has a disguise. Senapathy sees an Indian hindu student (Arjun), he got into Oxford University, but is stabbed and killed by Reggie. He is a roadman (please search it up for those who don't know). Senapathy learns that since the laws are so gender biased towards men in India and especially for hindus, Arjun works so hard to get into Oxford university, but is stabbed, so anyways there are some funny scenes in London, as Senapathy is in disguise, as in the coffee shop when he wants chai etc. Just to keep the audience in attention. But he remembers Reggie as the guy who shouts ""Bruv, you old bastard, who tf do you think you are mate"" (in a british accent) but at the London Bridge at night there is a fight with Reggie, his roadmen gang and Senapathy. Basically there is a funny contrast to London Roadmen and Rayalseema rowdies (since we can assume Senapathy is from there) but basically Senapathy says ""You dress in jackets and carry knives like cowards, but us Rayalseema people have the blood of warriors"", etc, so in London Bridge at night, an iconic fight scene happens, Reggie and his roadmen come all at him, but this time, the ""rowdies"" aren't Indian, they are white and black from London. And the insane BGM music reappears and basically it is a link to Indian 2, since he kills the 2nd golden villain on the bridge and british colonization since its set in London. But basically Senapathy does insane marmakala on Reggie's roadmen, and since the recording has gone viral, the Indian authorities know that he is in London, and as an iconic movie scene, as Reggie pulls up his gun to shoot Senapathy, Senapathy jumps on him and does marmakala on his neck, but Senapathy smartly kills all the guys and pushes them into the water so authorities cannot track finger prints, and as the british police say ""Put your hands up!"" Senapathy jumps into the water. And also it is known that Viktor escaped to New York. But both Lara and Viktor (big villains) are killed in New york, so 2 birds with one shot.

But now Bobby Simha comes again and is working with the british police to track him, since the indian series decipts police as not being able to catch him. But yes, then a huge surprise happens. Its new york and snowing and christmas, but who is Senapathy?? He is dressed as Santa Claus. üòÇ

**Third + Fouth villain Murder**

Anyways, its snowing in New york, and christmas festive vibes, and Senapathy is wearing a red Santa outfit (keep this in mind, it camouflages the blood) giving candy to kids and people whatever, but here an intense chase happens as Senapathy finds Viktor in his base, but a huge fight scene again happens. Viktor's men in vans try and shoot him as he is chasing Viktor, (Jason Momoa), think of the final chase of Indian 2. But anyways as Senapathy kills Viktor's goons, Viktor escapes to the nyc subway, and pulls a gun on the people to escape, and as they all run away, Viktor starts the tube (train), but still he is smart enough to keep some goons on his side, with guns, and Senapathy runs into the train before it closes. But Senapathy does insane marmakala here, we see all the fighting actions and things. But we have to know Viktor is a big eye, just like Lara and SJ suryah, even if he doesn't know Marmakala, he beats Senapathy up (I used inspiration from Rajamouli, since he makes villains strong not weak) but an intense scene is where Viktor tries to give a huge punch to Senapathy but still Senapathy performs marmakala on him before Viktor can touch him, but he gives an intense kill to Viktor and pushes Viktor of while the tube is moving and out of the glass. There is intense BGM music etc, because we have to make it more insane and more action scenes as Jason Momoa falls of the tube and breaks the glass. But the mystery is when the next station is coming, he isn't in the tube as the american police are searching for him and the foreign crowd cheers for him.

Now, before Senapathy goes to Lara, (since she is a badass hacker/fighter and can do Marmakala as well), she genuinely beats up Senapathy and weakens him, her men kidnap Senapathy and truly torture him, (Guys I know the next scene may look extremely cringe as a white woman tries to intimidate Senapathy but this just acknowledges her charcter) she says ""Oh hello Santa, or should I say Senapathyyyy? (SJ Suryah's charcter) set me up to kill you before the police sees you. Once the money in the Indian banks are gone, it will be just like the¬†**british empire**¬†left it"". The word¬†**british**¬†reminds Senapathy of his father's struggles, now it takes us to the flasback provided in the Indian 2 trailer of Senapathy's dad fighting against the british empire, but this is like 45 minutes, since it has to be continued from Indian 2. But then after the dream Senapathy wakes up, as we believe he is indeed trying to be killed, but SJ Suryah orders her to kill him sadistically. But anyways Senapathy gets up, becomes even more stronger since the dream and there is again an insane intense fight scene between Lara and her men, but Lara is stronger than Reggie and Viktor combined she knows marmakala and hugely damages Senapathy but still he wins against her and before the American police can catch him.

**Fifth and final villain murder (SJ Suryah)**

And finally Senapathy returns to Chennai, and almost everybody is ready for him, but then again this time a bigger chase happens with intense action scenes, and a huge fight happens between SJ suryah and Senapathy, and SJ suryah is about to win, but as he falls, Senapathy influences the crowd, brings national awareness in them and makes them fight SJ Suryah, and at the end kills SJ suryah, and gives a lecture to everybody, but this time everybody cheers for him and kneels for Senapathy and realize their mistakes and strive to create a better India, even the british and american police force kneel for him and Senapathy becomes a world wide icon and explains the mistakes of these 5 people and appeals to everybody.

**Now please rate this guys. I tried to make it more intense and cinematic.**¬†ü•∫

1kbrqaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1kbrqaz/meet_me_half_way/,Meet Me Half Way,"Sometimes I think that you might believe me being okay means you shouldn‚Äôt intrude or speak to me, because you‚Äôre afraid you‚Äôll cause more pain. Maybe you think, *‚ÄúOh, she‚Äôs healed, she‚Äôs better,‚Äù* or maybe it‚Äôs hard for you. I never really know what‚Äôs going on in your mind because you‚Äôre not here. I can‚Äôt read you from afar, and it all feels very trivial.

I write in these diaries for myself, trying to get all these thoughts out of my head. I‚Äôm an adult, I don‚Äôt feel the need to be someone who can‚Äôt open themselves to a conversation. So if you ever want to have one, know that I‚Äôm open. I‚Äôve always been open to that. I‚Äôm just not the kind of person who shuts people out just because we have a past. Why would I do that? We all deserve closure. We all deserve to find peace, or even just to speak the words that keep thumping in the night.

So, of course, everything I say on here, these are thoughts and things you may never hear, because that‚Äôs what a diary is, right? My writing might even be messy and filled with errors, I don‚Äôt know. I go about my day, glance here and there, and try my best not to think too much about the past, just to keep moving forward.

Our connection still feels extremely strong, and even if it fades, it lingers. I have to get these thoughts out, because if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll feel like everything inside me will just be buried. I don‚Äôt want to run. After meeting you, I realized that‚Äôs what I always did, I would run, I would self-sabotage because of all the trauma I‚Äôve ever been through. That wasn‚Äôt right. It wasn‚Äôt right for you. It wasn‚Äôt right for me. It wasn‚Äôt right for anyone.

I can‚Äôt say I don‚Äôt miss our conversations. As mundane as they may have seemed, I loved them, because they came from you. You were, and still are, very special to me.

So maybe one day, you‚Äôll have the courage to come by and say hi. Just tell me how you‚Äôve been. Tell me how everything is going, what life is like. Maybe we could get coffee, take that walk you always said you wanted to take, just be two adults who can handle a bit of communication.

Because in this life, why would we want to waste something so precious, like this connection, and not allow ourselves to at least find the glory in simply being as we are with each other?

I hate the restraints this world places on people, it‚Äôs sad. Many people believe that‚Äôs growth. But real growth, to me, is being able to stand beside someone, and even if distance has existed, still being able to come back and stand beside that person, just to say hello, just to be alive, just to be human.

To restrain people from being human, I find that insane. So many people find themselves in a position where they feel like they‚Äôre going crazy, because they can‚Äôt, and are pushed not to, be human. To feel. To have the ability to find an answer. Their answer is silence, and it‚Äôs cruel.

I hope you know, I‚Äôm okay. Your silence is not cruel to me. But if the silence is hurting you, if it‚Äôs cruel to your heart, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. I don‚Äôt want you to feel pain, that‚Äôs so unnecessary.

I hope one day you allow yourself the opportunity to trust someone with your heart. I hope one day you give me the opportunity to simply graze your presence. 

I love you unconditionally, and even without words, I know you love me too, even if it took the distance for you to become aware of how deep your love truly was.

1kbrprb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kbrprb/should_you_buy_rinsmola_g21_pro_wireless_earbuds/,Should You Buy Rinsmola G21 Pro Wireless Earbuds Review for Sound and Comfort?,"Testing out the Rinsmola G21 Pro Wireless Earbuds felt like diving into a world of auditory innovation. The market is flooded with earbuds these days, but these stood out with their promise of Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity, ENC noise-canceling microphones, and a hefty 36-hour battery life. I wear earbuds constantly‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm at the gym, on calls, or simply tuning out the world‚Äîso I was intrigued to see how these would hold up against my daily grind.

**Design and Comfort**

The first thing I noticed about these wireless earbuds was their ultra-lightweight design. At only 3.6 grams per earbud, they‚Äôre practically weightless. This makes them incredibly comfortable to wear for hours on end. Even my workout buddy noted how cool they looked‚Äîa sleek black finish combined with a minimalistic stick-style earpiece. What really stood out, though, were the silicone ear tips that come in multiple sizes (small, medium, large), ensuring you can find the perfect fit. I spent an hour running on the treadmill and another sweating through a spin session, and not once did they feel loose or uncomfortable.

**Wireless Connection and Performance**

Once I popped the earbuds out of the charging case, they connected to my phone in, no joke, a couple of seconds. That‚Äôs the magic of Bluetooth 5.4! These may have one of the fastest connections I‚Äôve ever experienced, and the signal stayed solid whether I was two feet or nearly 20 meters away from my device. It felt liberating not to experience drops in connection, especially during a Zoom call where I walked all over the house without once losing signal.

**Find the best price for Rinsmola G21 Pro on Amazon.**  

**Sound Quality and Noise Cancellation**

If you're a music enthusiast, the sound performance of these earbuds will undoubtedly impress you. With their 14.2mm graphene drivers and triple-layer composite diaphragm, the bass feels punchy without overpowering the delicate mids and highs. I tested them out with some bass-heavy tracks, plus a few acoustic pieces‚Äîand the stereo balance was excellent across the board. For phone calls, the ENC noise-canceling microphone did a great job filtering the ambient chaos. A conversation I had in a bustling coffee shop was surprisingly clear‚Äîalmost like I was in a quiet room.

**Battery Life and Charging**

Given my habit of forgetting to charge tech products, the 36-hour battery backup with the charging case was a huge plus. A single charge gave me eight hours of playtime, and with the pocket-sized case, I had an extra charging buffer ready to go at all times. The dual LED display on the charging box clearly indicates the power levels, which is surprisingly helpful when you‚Äôre juggling multiple devices. A quick 1.5-hour charging turnaround with the USB-C cable sealed the deal for me. Honestly, the battery life is so generous here that I forgot it even needed to be charged.

**Waterproof Build**

Among the top perks of these earbuds is their IP7 waterproof rating, promising excellent performance even during sweaty workouts or sudden rain showers. I gave them a stress test during an intense run here in my humid city, and they held up without any issues. For outdoor runners or fitness enthusiasts, you‚Äôll appreciate this waterproof layer of freedom.

**Smart Touch Controls**

Although I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre flawless, the touch controls are super convenient once you get the hang of them. You can tap to play/pause music, adjust the volume, answer calls, or even summon a voice assistant like Siri or Alexa. The high-precision chip worked most of the time, though there were a few instances when it felt overly sensitive to accidental touches. 

**Key Benefits**
- Fast and reliable Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity.  
- Immersive Hi-Fi sound performance with enhanced bass.  
- Comfortable, lightweight design made for extended use.  
- Long-lasting 36-hour battery with quick USB-C charging.  
- IP7 waterproof certification for sports and workouts.  

**Shortcomings**
- Touch controls can occasionally misfire with accidental taps.  
- No active noise cancellation, limiting some noise isolation features.  
- Lack of customizable sound profiles for audiophile-level tweaking.  

**Alternative Offerings**

Comparing the G21 Pro earbuds to the likes of AirPods Pro or Galaxy Buds, you‚Äôll immediately notice their price advantage. While AirPods shine in integration with the Apple ecosystem, these earbuds hold their own with exceptional sound isolation and more comprehensive fitness support (hello, waterproofing!). Versus the Galaxy Buds, I found the battery life trumped Samsung‚Äôs offering. That said, the touch sensitivity here isn‚Äôt quite as refined as Apple‚Äôs or Samsung's flagship models, and the lack of customizable EQ settings might disappoint audiophiles.

**Cost Effectiveness**

We all want to make purchases that feel like they‚Äôre worth every penny, and these earbuds genuinely deliver solid value. Considering the premium features‚ÄîBluetooth 5.4, ENC mics for calls, waterproofing, and 36-hour battery‚Äîthe performance matches or even eclipses more expensive brands. What surprised me the most was how budget-friendly they seemed for all the included extras, making it a smart option for anyone looking for affordable quality earbuds.

1kbrmaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Salt-Net4585/comments/1kbrmaw/the_night_the_lights_came_revised/,The Night The Lights Came (Revised),"

‚ÄîIt was almost midnight when I stepped out onto the porch. The air was warm and heavy, humming with crickets and the low, constant buzz of something I couldn't quite name. The porch light cast a dim golden circle around me, but beyond it, the night was vast and black.

I set the camera down on the railing, angled toward the sky‚Äîtoward that stretch of darkness where, for the past several nights, red lights had been appearing. People had started to talk. Not just online, but neighbors. Strangers in grocery store lines. The kind of talk that made your chest feel tight even when you told yourself it was just drones or military drills or some weird atmospheric trick.
But I hadn‚Äôt seen them for myself. Not really. Only caught the glow once through the trees. Tonight, I wanted to catch more than a glimpse. Maybe even proof.

I hit ‚Äúre-cord,‚Äù adjusted the lens, and then sat down on the top step.
And just like that, they were there.
Four‚Äîno, five‚Äîsmall red lights appeared in a perfect line across the sky. No sound. No warning. Just there. Then, before my breath had finished catching, they moved.

They broke formation and zipped overhead at a speed that defied physics. If I had blinked, they‚Äôd have been gone.
‚ÄúI saw them that time,‚Äù I said aloud, heart pounding, almost laughing with disbelief.
Then the world exploded in light.
A blinding white engulfed everything. I couldn‚Äôt close my eyes fast enough. I felt heat‚Äînot like sunlight, but something sharper, more direct. Piercing. And then‚Ä¶ black.
Not sleep. Not unconsciousness. Just‚Ä¶ gone.

I couldn‚Äôt see. Couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt speak.
But I could hear.
Disembodied voices‚Äîseveral of them‚Äîoverlapping, speaking in a language that slid right out of my brain the moment it touched it. Metallic clinks. Sharp beeps. The mechanical rhythm of something far too organized to be nature.
I wasn‚Äôt in my body. I didn‚Äôt have a body. I was just awareness, suspended in a soundscape of alien logic.

And then the panic hit.
I tried to scream. To thrash. To do anything. But I was sealed in. No arms. No legs. No breath. The harder I fought, the more the sounds shifted‚Äîlike whatever was out there didn‚Äôt like my resistance.
I kept screaming, even if it wasn‚Äôt coming out. Somewhere deep inside, I was still trying to reach the porch. The camera. Matt. Anyone.
And then‚Äî
Just as suddenly‚Äî
I was back.

Sunlight. Morning birds. Porch railing.
Matt‚Äôs truck was in the driveway.
I was lying on my side on the porch boards. Something soft beneath me.
A blanket.
One I didn‚Äôt bring outside.
My arms jerked before I meant to move them. My legs flailed, tangled. My body felt like wet concrete, and my vision was blurry, like I was seeing through fogged-up glass.

Matt‚Äôs voice broke through. ""Hey‚Äîare you okay?""
I tried to answer, but all that came out was a dry rasp. My throat felt like it had been sanded down. I managed to croak out, ""Help me.""
He stepped forward, crouched down, reached for my arm. ""If you say no again or swing at me, I'm going back inside,"" he said, like this had happened before. Like it was routine.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I gasped, barely audible. ‚ÄúHelp me.‚Äù
He pulled me up, and I stumbled like I‚Äôd forgotten how to walk. I leaned against the pillar in the living room, then half-ran, half-fell to the couch.
I still couldn‚Äôt feel my hands. My vision had improved, but the edges were gray. My voice was barely there, but I forced the words anyway.
‚ÄúI was out there since last night.‚Äù
Matt didn‚Äôt flinch. He just repeated it back to me, like he was trying to confirm it, then stepped outside.

When he returned, he was carrying the blanket.
The one I didn‚Äôt take outside.
‚ÄúI was out there since last night,‚Äù I said again. Louder. Begging him to hear me. To understand that something happened.
He didn‚Äôt answer.
I opened my mouth to tell him everything‚Äîbut I woke up.
‚Äî‚Äî

I sat on the couch for a long time after Matt walked away. The blanket‚Äîgray, soft, unfamiliar‚Äîwas draped over my lap like it belonged there. I didn‚Äôt remember bringing it out. I didn‚Äôt remember owning it.

I ran my fingers over it. My skin still tingled, like it wasn‚Äôt quite mine. My hands were clumsy, like they were attached wrong. I blinked hard. Everything looked real, but felt‚Ä¶ filtered. Like I was dreaming I was awake.

Matt moved around in the kitchen, making noise like nothing had happened. Cabinets. Drawers. Running water. Like it was just any other morning.
I tried again. ‚ÄúMatt.‚Äù
He looked over. ‚ÄúYou want coffee?‚Äù
I stared at him. He hadn‚Äôt asked what happened. Didn‚Äôt seem worried that I was stammering and stumbling, that I could barely stand five minutes ago. That I was outside all night. That I had a blanket I‚Äôd never seen before wrapped around me like a souvenir.
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said slowly. ‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶ see the camera?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat camera?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe one on the porch. I was recording the sky.‚Äù
Matt frowned. ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt any camera out there.‚Äù

I stared at him.
‚ÄúNo, I left it on the railing,‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúI set it up. I hit record.‚Äù
He shrugged. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not there now.‚Äù
I pushed the blanket off and stood‚Äîtoo fast. My knees buckled and I caught myself on the coffee table. Matt didn‚Äôt move to help.
The porch was empty.
No camera. No tripod. Not even the little black bag I‚Äôd brought it out in.

The railing where I‚Äôd mounted it was undisturbed. The wood was cool beneath my fingertips, damp with dew‚Äîbut no marks, no indentations, no sign that anything had ever been there.
I backed up. My heart started its old familiar thump, thump, thump. But this wasn‚Äôt anxiety.
This was wrong.

Later, I searched the house. Every shelf, every drawer. No camera. No memory card. No gray blanket in the linen closet, either. Just the one still folded neatly over the couch.
It smelled like ozone.
Like the sky after lightning.

I picked it up. Buried my nose in it. It wasn‚Äôt one of ours. It wasn‚Äôt from here. That thought‚Äîabsurd and quiet‚Äîtook root and wouldn‚Äôt let go.
I should‚Äôve been able to rationalize it. Sleepwalking, maybe. A hallucination. But I hadn‚Äôt imagined the scratch in my throat or the soreness in my limbs. I hadn‚Äôt imagined the way the porch boards were damp on one side, like something had been left sitting there overnight. Like me.
Or how, when I looked at the sky that night, I couldn‚Äôt find a single star.


That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep.
I tried‚ÄîGod knows I tried. But every time I closed my eyes, I felt it. That same brightness behind my lids. That humming in my teeth. I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, blanket pulled to my chest, listening to the faint static of silence between the ticking of the wall clock.

At some point, I gave up and went back to the porch. I brought the blanket with me. I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe I wanted to see if they‚Äôd come back.
Maybe I wanted to see if I had.

The stars were back.
Too many of them. Like someone had copy-pasted constellations where they didn‚Äôt belong. Some were too bright. Some flickered like damaged pixels. And one of them‚Äîjust one‚Äîmoved.
Not fast, like the red lights.
Slow.
Deliberate.

I watched it until my neck ached. Then I looked down and realized something was off.
The railing was on the wrong side.
I stood up slowly. The wood under my feet groaned, and I froze‚Äîbecause the groan echoed twice. Once from under me. Once from somewhere else.
I turned to go back inside. My hand touched the door handle‚Äîand it was wrong too.
The handle was smooth. Ours was ridged. The paint around it was peeling, like it hadn‚Äôt been touched in years. And through the glass, the living room looked‚Ä¶ shifted.

The couch faced the wrong way.
The lamp by the chair was green. Ours was blue.
The blanket on the arm was gray.
My breath hitched.
I opened the door.
The air inside was cold. I stepped in. One step. Two. Something buzzed under my feet, like a low voltage current. I reached for the blanket on the couch, fingers trembling.

The moment I touched it, the lights in the room flickered‚Äîand everything shuddered.
The couch jumped. The walls pulsed in and out, like they‚Äôd forgotten where they were supposed to be. The lamp blinked off, then on, then off again, leaving a faint afterimage in the air like a smear of oil on water.

I stumbled backward, heart hammering.
This wasn‚Äôt my house.
Or maybe it was.
Or maybe it used to be.

I bolted out the door, down the steps, across the yard into the cold night air‚Äîand stopped dead.
Because the real porch light was still on.
On another porch.
Identical. Across the street.
The house I had just come out of didn‚Äôt exist.
Not anymore.
I turned to look at the yard I‚Äôd just crossed, but it was gone.
Just blackness.
Endless.
Shifting.
Like someone had erased it behind me.

I ran until my lungs burned. When I finally found myself outside the real house‚Äîmy house‚Äîmy legs gave out and I collapsed onto the grass. The real porch was quiet. Still. The railing was on the right side. The door handle was ridged. The couch was facing the TV again.
And Matt‚Ä¶ was asleep on the couch.
Like nothing had ever happened.
I crawled up the steps. The gray blanket was still there, waiting.
I picked it up.
And for a second‚Äîjust one second‚ÄîI swore it exhaled.

I didn‚Äôt tell Matt what happened.
Not when he woke up.
Not the next morning.
Not when I found the blanket neatly folded at the foot of our bed, even though I‚Äôd left it downstairs.
There was no point. He didn‚Äôt see it.
Not the way I did.
And it was starting to feel like seeing it was the problem.

The third night, I heard something speak.
Not a voice‚Äîmore like a thought pushed into my skull. Something deep and slow and terrible, rising up from beneath the edges of sleep. It didn‚Äôt use words at first, only pressure. Shapes that didn‚Äôt fit in language. But it wanted me to understand.
We left it with you.
I sat bolt upright. The blanket was over me again.
I hadn‚Äôt brought it upstairs.

That day, I stayed out of the house.
Drove to a coffee shop, sat in the back, tried to scroll through my phone like a normal person. Tried to pretend that every screen didn‚Äôt flicker when I passed. That people didn‚Äôt seem a little off‚Äîa little delayed, like they were buffering before they moved. Like someone was loading their next line of dialogue.
I searched missing time.
I searched abductions, night terrors, red lights in sky.
I searched gray blankets.
Nothing helpful.
But I did find a forum. Buried. Old. Mostly dead.
Just a few threads with names I didn‚Äôt recognize and dates that stopped around 2017.
But one thread stood out. Titled:
‚ÄúTHEY LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND.‚Äù
Inside: a single post.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always small. Something that doesn‚Äôt belong. A coat, a coin, a sound you can‚Äôt place. It‚Äôll feel normal at first. But it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs theirs. And once you touch it, you‚Äôre not fully here anymore. It‚Äôs like a hook in the skin of your world. And they‚Äôre still holding the line.
Don‚Äôt sleep under it. Don‚Äôt let them think you‚Äôve accepted it.
If you do, they don‚Äôt need to take you again. You‚Äôre already gone.‚Äù

My hands went cold.
I looked up and caught my reflection in the coffee shop window. The world behind me looked warped, bent at the corners. My reflection blinked slower than I did.

That night, I didn‚Äôt go home.
I parked in a Walmart lot and tried to sleep in the car. But sleep didn‚Äôt come.
Instead, something else did.
At 2:17 a.m., my radio turned on by itself. A burst of static. Then: the sound of banging. Clinking. Beeping.

Then a voice‚Äîmy own voice‚Äîhoarse, broken:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ help me‚Ä¶‚Äù
I screamed and ripped the key from the ignition. The radio didn‚Äôt stop.
It kept playing until sunrise.

I went back home with the sunrise behind me, expecting to find the blanket waiting.
It wasn‚Äôt.
Matt was gone, too.
Not missing.
Gone.
No record. No trace. No toothbrush. No favorite hoodie. Not even a picture of him in my phone gallery.
Like he‚Äôd been undone.
Like he never existed.
But I remembered him.
Didn‚Äôt I?

That night, I stood on the porch again, empty camera bag in hand. The sky above me flickered like film burning in a projector.
Four lights appeared. Then five. Then six.
They hovered in a crooked line.
I didn‚Äôt sit down this time.
I just whispered, ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù
And the lights didn‚Äôt zoom away.
They drifted lower.
‚Äî‚Äî

The lights hovered.
Low enough now to hum through my chest, a sound like deep breath and distant thunder.
I stood my ground.
Fists clenched. Knees shaking.
‚ÄúNo more,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to have me.‚Äù
The lights pulsed in response‚Äîred halos blooming outward like ripples on the surface of a pond. The air around me tightened. My ears popped. Then came that sound again‚Äîbeeping, mechanical clinks, voices just beneath the threshold of understanding.
And I felt it, in my bones: they were still holding the line.

I stepped back inside.
I found the blanket in the closet, folded neatly between towels that didn‚Äôt belong to me.
It was warm to the touch.
Like something breathing.
I grabbed it anyway and hauled it into the backyard. I poured lighter fluid over it with trembling hands and dropped a lit match.
Flames caught instantly‚Äîtoo fast.
The fire surged like it had lungs.
But the blanket didn‚Äôt curl or blacken.
It screamed.
A high-pitched wail so sharp it cut through my skull.
I fell to my knees, clutching my head, eyes squeezed shut as the fire turned blue, then white‚Äî
‚Äîand then vanished.
Not burned. Not reduced to ash.
Just gone.
Like it had never been there.

I thought it was over.
I thought maybe I‚Äôd won.
But the next night, I heard knocking.
Not on the front door.
From inside the house.
Inside the walls.
It came at 3:33 a.m.
It came again the next night. And the one after.
I didn‚Äôt sleep. I didn‚Äôt eat. I stopped going outside. I stopped checking the clock.
Reality peeled at the edges‚Äîpaint flaking off the corners of the world.
My reflection didn‚Äôt blink back anymore.
Sometimes I heard Matt‚Äôs voice calling from other rooms. Sometimes I answered.
He never replied.

One night, I found the front door already open.
Outside, the red lights waited, hanging just above the lawn.
Closer than they‚Äôd ever come.
They didn‚Äôt move.
They didn‚Äôt need to.
They‚Äôd been here the whole time.
I stepped out barefoot, wearing only what I‚Äôd been sleeping in. The world behind me felt paper-thin. I could‚Äôve ripped through it with a breath.
I didn‚Äôt look back.
I didn‚Äôt need to.
They‚Äôd left something behind.
And now, I was what they left behind for someone else.

No one remembers me.
The house is empty now.
The porch light stays on.
Sometimes the blanket shows up again.
Sometimes someone sees the lights.
Sometimes they sit down to watch the sky.
And sometimes‚Äîwhen they do‚Äî
everything changes.

1kbrj8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1kbrj8x/anxiety_or_heart_issues/,Anxiety or heart issues ?,"I‚Äôm really not sure what to do at this point  & i‚Äôm sorry if this is long i really need advice or some insight anything would help. I‚Äôll start this off by giving a little background of when this has happened. Firstly I‚Äôm a 26F, healthy majority of my life no surgeries or allergies, and i don‚Äôt do energy drinks or coffee (not everyday to coffee, maybe 5 times out of a whole month). Back in I think 2021 there was this period in my life where I felt so sick and I literally couldn‚Äôt eat and forgive me, I can‚Äôt really remember anything specific that was happening that had me so stressed out, but I know for sure that it was something going on. And of course at that time I didn‚Äôt think it would be anxiety I thought that i was sick. I went to my doctor and he said that everything looks well and it‚Äôs probably just anxiety. A few days later I started feeling better and was able to eat without wanting to throw up. Time jump all the way to 2024 I started experiencing heart palpitations, and at this point since i do remember, I will say that I WAS stressed out about alot of things..even when I try not to be I guess.. The heart palpitations would be on and off but then when I got around to let‚Äôs say October 2024, it was becoming a reoccurring thing. There wouldn‚Äôt be a day out of the week where I didn‚Äôt get them, and with it would come shortness of breath. I did go to the doctor and we did an EKG and she told me that I possibly have a heart murmur. I left that appointment still feeling like i didn‚Äôt get any answers honestly or clarity bc even she seemed unsure but then she ended up not being a doctor at that hospital anymore. 

I went again with another new doctor who was more clear and helped me understand what was going on better. She told me the EKG test was normal but she did see my heart palpitations but it wasn‚Äôt anything to be concerned about. So besides me having low iron (started taking my iron supplements every day since then) she said that heart palpitations could be due to anxiety and in order for me to know more if i‚Äôm still concerned or doesn‚Äôt go away, I would have to go see a cardiologist. She did ask me if I wanted something for anxiety, but I turned it down because I felt like I wasn‚Äôt really understanding why I was having anxiety and I didn‚Äôt know anything about the medication so I was kind of scared of the outcome. I wasn‚Äôt able to go to the cardiologist and that‚Äôs only because whenever I tried to call and make an appointment, nobody would pick up the phone, which was odd, so I just kind of took that as a sign that OK maybe I don‚Äôt need this. Maybe it‚Äôs just my iron. 

Fast forward again I‚Äôm back into my regular routine. I‚Äôm taking my iron supplements, but I still have the heart palpitations every day, literally the whole day. It doesn‚Äôt always give me shortness of breath, but 50% of the time it does. So now we‚Äôre at the current timeline which is this week and nothing has changed.  I‚Äôm at work and I work a very physical job. I‚Äôm lifting boxes bending over a lot walking, not the kind of job that I wanted but times are tough. I started feeling really hot and felt like I was about to faint, heart was beating hard as usual, so I slowed down what I was doing and drunk some more water and I even drunk an electrolyte beverage. I felt better in the next 5 minutes. A few days later, I‚Äôm sleeping at my boyfriend‚Äòs house and I wake up, literally sweating bullets and of course, my first thought is the AC must have not turned on overnight and I just got really hot because this doesn‚Äôt happen to me at my house. I almost fainted, worst feeling ever I didn‚Äôt know what my body was trying to do. I crawled downstairs got some water & electrolytes AGAIN & 15 minutes later, it subsided. Third time, which was yesterday, I woke up at 5 AM, not sweating, but I did feel like my neck was a little warm and then I had another episode of nearly fainting. It felt like my blood pressure was dropping. I was overheating and it just wasn‚Äôt a good feeling just like before, it did not go away. I thought something was wrong with me so I asked my boyfriend to take me to the hospital and he did. 

When I got there, I still wasn‚Äôt feeling any better and then I think I was just freaking out and concerned and a little scared of what could be wrong with me so that didn‚Äôt help. I felt my heart beating so hard. I do bloodwork, EKG, did a chest x-ray and a CT scan and at the end, everything is literally normal and fine‚Ä¶..

 What in the world is wrong with me?  The doctor did refer me to a cardiologist which I will be working on going to, but I‚Äôm afraid it will be a waste of time. Has anybody else experienced what I have ? I feel so stuck because although everything is showing normal and healthy inside, I‚Äôm not sure what else to do. Is it really anxiety? I mean, I know it is most of the time and i‚Äôm kind of accepting now that i do struggle with that. Especially as of lately, life has been whooping my ass. I went to work today and I felt like I almost fainted again this morning. Obviously I‚Äôm thinking about it. I don‚Äôt want it to happen again, but I‚Äôm worried because I work really early in the morning & i‚Äôm thinking maybe I didn‚Äôt get enough sleep. Maybe this job is too much on my body, even though i workout every other week. Even talking about it is making me anxious. Any advice ? üòì",1,1746047510.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

If you pledge 2 units first round and destory 2,  you get 2 points.
Meaning I can give one unit in turn 2 Re-Roll Hit rolls of 1? Or does it effect the army? 

Secondly, how are people tracking/displaying Pledges?

The acting was spot-on. It struck the perfect balance‚Äînever too cheesy, never overdone. Unlike many other dramas adapted from manga or anime, this one felt grounded and real. The suspense and pacing kept me hooked from beginning to end, and I appreciated the careful attention to detail throughout.

I especially loved the lead actress and how her character was portrayed. She felt authentic‚Äînot exaggerated or cartoonish‚Äîand the same goes for the male characters. They were refreshingly normal, not creepy or over-the-top like you sometimes see in similar shows.

# Introduction

Focusmate changed my life. I started using it mid-2023 and have been a power user since 2023. Here are the high-level stats:

* I've spent 2,456 hours on Focusmate.
* I've met 1,447 people.
* I have 10+ friends with whom I've spent between 30 and 300 hours.
* I've met five of my Focusmate friends in person. I've had a Focusmate's family over for dinner, gone to a party with a Focusmate, and stayed at a Focusmate's apartment.
* I met my best friend and many close friends through Focusmate.
* I've become significantly more productive and intentional with my time.

[Focusmate](http://focusmate.com/?ref=parconley.com)¬†is a coworking website. For the length of 25, 50, or 75 minutes, you work in a 1-on-1 video call with a partner. Most people use the app to hold themselves accountable on work projects, and the body-doubling effect helps keep users on task. To get started, create an account, book a session, and work with someone the algorithm pairs you with. Each person states their task for the session, then we work separately until a chime signals the end of the session, at which time we report back on our progress (or lack thereof!). Over time, you can ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù people and develop regular partners.

The productivity benefits of Focusmate are obvious and immediate. Co-working holds you accountable for your goals and creates structure where there often is none. This guide will not explain how or why to use Focusmate. Instead, I want to teach you how to make Focusmate your third place.

# What‚Äôs a third place

The modern world lacks third places. We have first places (home) and second places (work), but lack meaningful third places‚Äîvoluntarily chosen social settings distinct from home and work, where people gather primarily for informal interaction. The modern world has social media apps, but socializing on these apps lacks the richness and connection that video interaction provides. In-person third places include coffee shops, gyms, and meetup groups, but often lack the selection effects of social media. By selection effects, I mean the ability of social media to enable finding people with incredibly similar interests or compatible personalities.

To successfully build a third place on Focusmate, you will have to spend multiple hours a week working on a regular schedule for a few months. Building a social life anywhere takes time; the same is true on Focusmate. This guide has the potential to transform your social life, especially if you're a remote worker or student.

# Start conversations at the end of sessions

# Making conversation¬†

The general flow of a Focusmate session is as follows:

1. Ask each other ""How are you?"" and ""What are you working on?""
2. Potentially make brief conversation and/or catch-up.
3. Work for 25/50/75min until session ends (usually muted, not talking).
4. Ask each other ""How did your session go?""
5. Either sign off or¬†***make conversation***.

Making conversation at the end of sessions is key to making friends on Focusmate.

Small talk is fundamental in building connections of any kind. Whatever third place you seek to develop relationships in, you must make small talk. You¬†*must*¬†start conversations.

# Starting conversations is scary and awkward

At first, making conversations at the end of a Focusmate session was¬†*scary*¬†for me. Scary because I wondered ‚ÄúWhat if my Focusmate didn't want to make conversation? What if they reject me?‚Äù It's quite possible they will reject you. People are busy. That said, I'd say 80% of your Focusmate will be around for at least a couple of lines of conversation.

In addition to being scary, starting conversations at the end of Focusmate sessions can be awkward, at least at first. What should I say? Here's what I do: ask questions. Ask what your partner was working on, specifically. Ask about a shared interest from their profile. If something they say reveals their profession, ask them about that. This may be clumsy at first, but after the 500th time, you'll know the social scripts that a post-session conversation can take.

If you struggle with or want to become better at conversations, I recommend the blog post¬†[Good conversations have lots of doorknobs](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/good-conversations-have-lots-of-doorknobs?ref=parconley.com)¬†by psychology researcher and improvisationalist Adam Mastroianni. I‚Äôve used the post‚Äôs framework for conversations as sequences of doorknobs consistently since I read it.

# Be proactive in making friends

Focusmate is not automatically a third place.

This¬†[Tyler Alterman](https://x.com/TylerAlterman/status/1881743439852720424?ref=parconley.com)¬†thread ‚Äî starting, ""Ppl underestimate how proactive you need to be to make friends as an adult‚Äù ‚Äî is excellent.¬†

If you want to build connections on Focusmate, you must go out of your way to build new social habits. While similar in some respects, making friends on Focusmate is not like making friends in college or at work. Making Focusmate friends requires being proactive.¬†

Many Focusmate users do not go out of their way to make Focusmate their third place. It's possible you'll look weird to these people. That's completely fine, you have different goals than them: you're looking to use Focusmate as a third place, maybe they‚Äôre just looking for focus.

# Curate your neighborhood

# Favorite and snooze aggressively

There are many thousands of Focusmate users. You'll almost always have a partner.

If you see someone once and neither of you favorite the other, it will likely be weeks or months before you see each other again. If you want to see someone again, favorite them. I favorite people from whom I get even a minimal signal of shared interests and cool vibes.

Additionally, you don't like your partner's vibe, snooze them. Do this systematically. There are thousands of Focusmate users, so even if you tried, you can't snooze everyone! Another thing you can do is snooze people on intervals. For example, if you enjoy seeing someone once per week or month, snooze them for a month and re-snooze them next time you see them.

This habit of favoriting and snoozing people will change your Focusmate experience drastically over time.

# Develop close friends

The flow of developing close friends on Focusmate has generally followed this structure:

* Have a nice conversation after one of our first sessions, one of us favorites the other, or we both favorite each other.
* We start working together on a recurring basis, sometimes locking in sessions with each other.
* At some point, we may become closer off-platform and grow our friendship from there. Though most of the connection deepens during recurring Focusmate sessions, similar to how you'd grow close with someone you sit next to in class each day. The propinquity effect!

Over time, a common pattern for people's Focusmate habits is to go from breadth to depth. You'll know you successfully cultivated your third place when you have a calendar full of favorite Focusmate partners whom you're excited to see every week. You could even think of it as a nice little neighborhood!

# There's a message box

I didn't know there was a way to reach people after sessions until someone messaged me via the message box. If you click on a session, the Focusmate client gives you the option of sending a note to your past partners. Note that this is only available for a week after a session. Use it to share the reference of a book or a link to an interesting video you talked about, and perhaps offer your email address as a way to get back to you if they so desire.

# Build a routine of using Focusmate

# Have a recurring schedule every week

Friendships are developed through recurring interactions. To make friends at a coffee shop, you need to be at the coffee shop when you expect the people you want to connect with to be there, too. This implies two things: you need to commit to a minimum of a few hours per week, and to have a recurring schedule of sorts. For me, this was working for a block of a few hours per day in the mornings. Eventually, I would find someone who also works at that time and I also have shared rapport with.

# Stick with it for a few months

This is crucial. Do not expect to have made friends within the first days, weeks, or even months. You‚Äôll need to think long-term if you‚Äôd like to build a third place on Focusmate. Friendship, trust, and rapport are built through recurring interactions that build over a long period of time.

# Conclusion

Much of the skills that go into cultivating your Focusmate third place apply to human social life generally. Some people are naturally better at it than others. That said, social skills can be learned.¬†

Excerpts from A Letter to My Love: A Philosophical and Spiritual Meditation on Humanity.



**Individual/Personal Level:**

""Our separation shows me that I have taken you for granted, that I miss you a lot and love you more in your absence. I miss your presence, I miss waking up next to you, I miss our hours-long talks, I miss the closeness that we shared in both the beautiful and mundane moments of life, I miss you coming home after work, I miss walking side by side with you during our adventures. Life is much better, safer, brighter, and more comforting with you by my side. But despite all this, I can‚Äôt give you what you want and what you deserve in a life partner because, truthfully, my ambition might take me away any day. Giving you the time and space to figure out what you want and possibly to finally move on from us is heartbreaking. Another gash to my heart, of my own making, and with it, I gash your heart too. Does wound add depth to our character? Is that my gift to you? How deep is the cut of a 20-year relationship?

Many times, I awake in cold sweats in the middle of the night, horrified at the realization of our separation. There‚Äôs something magical in the dark silence of the night that allows me to see things with clarity. In truth, there were already a couple of nights when I was lying next to you during our good times when the same realization came up. To contemplate the outcome of our separation and what we both lose because of it‚Äîa lifetime of ups and downs, of countless more memories and moments grounded in an unshakeable love for one another‚Äîfills me with a deep sense of sorrow and loneliness that inflicts a heavy, piercing sensation in my heart.

Then I think of the helpless and voiceless beings‚Äîthe Asiatic bears, the monkeys, the calves and cows, pigs, chickens, mice, rabbits, and the trafficked, exploited, or abused human beings‚Äîlonely and trapped in their cages without hope. What kind of life are they living? What are they waiting for in the silence of the night? I can feel their plea: ‚ÄúMy love, my love, why have you forsaken me?‚Äù My heart ‚Ä¶ it breaks again. The heavy, piercing sensation transforms into a suffocating vortex. One pain to overwhelm and subdue another.

Love‚Äîis the problem too much of it, or too little? What does it say about my love, your love, and humanity‚Äôs love? Which is too much, and which is too little?¬†

How many strands of memories and connections have formed over 20 years? Isn't it ironic that a rope binding two opposite sides so tightly is also straining to snap apart from the tension? The severed strands fray and curl away from each other, as if turning away in sorrow, resentment, and disdain. I cried and grieved for my own death, seeing the innocence in the eyes of my younger self, unaware of the overwhelming pain that would eventually consume him. I grieve for my mother, family, and friends because what they have is an empty shell of me. I grieve for us‚Äîthe family and future we could have had. I see this potentiality as a delicate strand of silk, glimmering and floating in the air; my hand gently caresses its aura, feeling the entirety of its weight, joy, and loss. My heart keeps breaking.

Perhaps in an alternate dimension, I would wake up next to you from this nightmare, tears streaming down my face from the deep sorrow and sacrifice we had to endure. The heaviness would linger for a while, but it would make me appreciate you even more, as lovers who nearly lost one another gain an appreciation beyond petty grievances and fights. In that life, we would honor and carry the weight of our wedding vows, loving each other through thick and thin.""

¬†



**Collective/Humanity Level:**

""Humanity is an ocean, but I feel so disconnected. Despite the reality, I still long for you, my love‚Äîthe ideal humanity of wisdom, kindness, and strength. You were my first love, and how does one let that go? The memory of our ideal still haunts me. I imagine the real you are just away for a while. Whether at a spiritual war or on a meditation journey, you‚Äôll eventually come back to me. I miss the comfort and joy within your protection and guidance. I feel your absence in every love song, every longing, every heartbreak, and every betrayal. Your mirage is hazy and just out of reach.

In my loneliness, I reach out to you with my arm outstretched, my hand searching for yours, longing for a slight touch just to know you‚Äôre there. I wish for your hand to firmly grasp mine ‚Ä¶ I wish for your hug to cradle my solitude ‚Ä¶ I wish to collapse with joy and exhaustion in your embrace. How I wish to sob into your warmth and tell you everything that happened, blaming you for being away while holding you tighter. I wish that you‚Äôd tell me everything will be okay because you‚Äôre back now.

But what is reality, my love? My hand searches but grasps at thin air, the painful contrast between your warm sustenance and empty space. I curl my fingers inward to feel the emptiness, to feel your absence, to feel my heart continually breaking.

At times, I dream of you coming back to visit me, meeting up at a wooden table outside a quaint coffee shop under the fog of moonlight. In the haziness of these dreams, you are loving and cheerful, making small talk and sharing with me your hopes and dreams. As for me, I‚Äôm just awestruck and happy to see you again, uncertain why there‚Äôs an underlying sense of sorrow. As we talk, you gently chastise me for not doing enough, that I should do better and be better, and that you‚Äôll always believe in me. Then ‚Ä¶ you get up and turn your back to walk into the fog, slowly fading away, leaving me alone to pick up the pieces. I cry, not within your embrace but in your absence.

I live in longing and sorrow, trapped in that space between flickering hope and heartbreaking despair. I search for the ideal of humanity in the reflection of your eyes. Many people I‚Äôve talked to say that human nature cannot be changed; that I‚Äôm na√Øve and delusional in my ambition; that I‚Äôm giving up a good life to chase after an impossible dream. What is human nature, and can it be changed? What is the voluntary sacrifice of one life if it can benefit many others? Despite it all, I still love and believe in you.""

¬†¬†

Lyric:

You are a boundless sea

But I'm so far from shore

You were my first true love

How could I need you more?

You held me once with care

Now all I breathe is air

¬†

Where are you now, my love?

Are you lost in the storm?

I reach for you at night

But only feel the cold

I ache to hear you say

""I'm back, I've found the way.""

But silence fills my chest

My love, you never stay

¬†

I hear you in the songs

In joy and in the ache

I stretch my hand through fog

But touch the wind that breaks

Your warmth is just a ghost

The dream I miss the most

¬†

A shadow dances in the empty hall

Your whispered name still echoes through it all

The air is heavy like a solemn hymn

Memories linger where the light is dim

¬†

Lost in the echoes of your melody

A song forgotten but it lives in me

Each note is carved into my trembling soul

Broken yet whole you make me feel it all

¬†

Soft piano hums like it knows your face

The strings are weeping for your empty place

Each ambient sigh feels like heaven's cry

Yet love still burns where the ashes lie

¬†

Lost in the echoes of your melody

A song forgotten but it lives in me

Each note is carved into my trembling soul

Broken yet whole you make me feel it all

¬†

Your spirit lingers in the twilight's haze

Like fire dancing through the smoky maze

A haunting silence holds the loudest weight

Should I just terminate my probationary contract?

So I recently got hired as a barista. The contract says I have two months of probationary work, but I‚Äôve only been there a week and honestly? It‚Äôs been rough.

I actually love my co-baristas. They're cool, helpful in their own way. But the manager? Oh man. She's something else. She was the one who interviewed me, and from Day 1, she hasn‚Äôt stopped bragging about how ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù their coffee shop is compared to others.

Like, on my second day, she asked me how many drinks we served at my old place. I said around 15, and she immediately went, ‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs why,‚Äù with this smug tone like that‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm ""too slow"" for their standards. Mind you, I‚Äôve barely had any proper training. I was trying to follow their formula the best I could, but everyone including her kept eyeballing the ingredients instead of using a scale. Then when I did the same? Suddenly it was wrong and I got blamed for it.

By my third day, I was scheduled to close. My manager started rushing me through inventory, restocking, and deep cleaning all while she was literally waiting to leave so she could go home, since she had to open the next morning. Thing is, no one had actually taken the time to walk me through their closing system. I was piecing it together the best I could. And then get this she just straight up left. I thought I was done, finally, but then she calls me from while i was cleaning to tell me I didn‚Äôt shut the machine down properly. Like, seriously?

Then she hits me with, ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you head barista before? You should already know this.‚Äù

I haven‚Äôt once shown attitude or acted like I knew better. I‚Äôve just been trying to keep my head down and do the work. I even told her, I know I have experience, but I‚Äôm starting from scratch here. Every shop is different, right?

It‚Äôs only been a week, and I already feel drained. I have the option to terminate my probationary contract. I just don't know if it's worth staying for the rest of it or if I should just cut my losses now.

What would you do?

UPDATE : 

It's been a month! 

I got pissed again yesterday. Things were already okay between me and the manager before I went home. But earlier, before my shift ended, we were discussing the monthly schedule. I had put in a time-off request for my exams, but she said it couldn‚Äôt be fully approved like two of the days wouldn‚Äôt be granted. Then she asked, ""What‚Äôs this every Tuesday and Friday?"" I told her those are my school days, so I‚Äôm hoping to have them off this May. Then she said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not possible.‚Äù I replied, Ma‚Äôam, I can still come to work those days, but I‚Äôll be late because my class ends at 4 PM.‚Äù Her response? That‚Äôs not my problem.‚Äù

Man, I swear, my blood was boiling. My co-barista heard her say that and looked at me, even did a finger gun gesture. I said, ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm leaving earlier than expected.‚Äù We already talked about this during my interview that my school days couldn‚Äôt be compromised. She even asked for my class schedule. So what‚Äôs the point?

It‚Äôs just frustrating we had this conversation during the hiring process. They knew my school schedule. So what was the point of all that if they‚Äôre just going to ignore it now?

I'm planning to give them my notice as soon as I get my salary. I‚Äôm done with this place.

I picked up an EKG Pro recently and very quickly encountered frequent ""add water"" warnings despite the kettle being entirely full, seemingly triggered by keeping water at boiling for more than a few minutes.

Contacted customer support about this issue, and they sent out a replacement kettle, but I noticed a number of fit and finish differences between the replacement and my old one. Looking at the SKUs, it seems like my old one has a ""Rev A"" on it, whereas the replacement doesn't. I've tried searching a bit and haven't found any information about these revisions, so I'm curious if anyone here is aware of what they are, and if Rev A is older/newer or better/worse?

Some of the differences I've noticed on the non-revisioned replacement:

* Finish is shinier and less matte
* Kettle is slightly taller
* Lid is way tighter, and not as flush to the sides of the kettle body
* Buttons on the base are looser and more clicky
* At a boil, steam will exit through the top vent, whereas this wouldn't happen on the Rev A model
* No false add water warnings

So, while the electronics seem less buggy on the replacement, the finish feels a lot cheaper than it does on the Rev A model",1,1746046836.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I sat down to wait and it took them like 5 minutes to get my drinks and coffee cake. I picked them up and went to sit down and wait on the rest. For context there was just two of us inside and there was four baristas and one person in the drive thru. After waiting an additional 11 mins * they were pointing at me asking themselves if they had missed something or why I was still there. No one ever asked me anything* I went to ask for my missing items. They said they‚Äôd get them right out. She told the barista who took my order to make them.

She looked at me rolled her eyes and told me ‚ÄúNext time order what you want and you‚Äôll get it‚Äù. I said thank you and left.

1kbr7pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfyChairs/comments/1kbr7pb/what_are_sling_patio_chairs/,What are sling patio chairs?,"When Mark and Lisa bought their first home in Arizona, one of the things they were most excited about was finally having a backyard patio. They imagined warm summer evenings, barbecue with friends, and lazy mornings with coffee outside. But first, they needed furniture that could handle the desert heat and still be comfortable enough to relax in. That‚Äôs how their journey into discovering sling patio chairs began.

They started by browsing local furniture stores and websites. A lot of the listings mentioned ‚Äúsling chairs,‚Äù a term neither of them was familiar with. They asked around and found a few online forums where people shared their experiences. One person mentioned how sling patio chairs had been a great fit for their poolside area‚Äîlightweight, weather-resistant, and surprisingly supportive. Another user explained that the ‚Äúsling‚Äù part referred to the fabric seat suspended between the frame, which cradles the body without needing extra cushions.

That intrigued Mark and Lisa. They read more reviews and found that most sling chairs use materials like PVC-coated polyester or Textilene fabric, which dries quickly and doesn‚Äôt fade easily in the sun. The chairs usually have a metal or aluminum frame, which keeps them light but durable. One couple on a blog even talked about leaving their sling chairs out all year in the Texas heat without any issues.

Eventually, Mark and Lisa visited a local outdoor furniture store to try some out. They noticed right away how breathable the sling fabric felt. It didn‚Äôt stick to their skin like vinyl or leather might in the heat, and the gentle give of the fabric made the chairs more comfortable than expected. They tried a few styles‚Äîstackable ones, reclining ones, even a few with matching ottomans.

They ended up buying a set of four reclining sling chairs with a matching table. Over the next few months, the chairs became a regular part of their outdoor life. Lisa loved how easy they were to clean‚Äîjust a quick spray with the hose. Mark appreciated how they held up during a summer monsoon, drying quickly without any mildew or staining.

Looking back, they were glad they didn‚Äôt go with bulky cushioned furniture that needed constant care. The sling chairs were exactly what they needed: simple, sturdy, and comfortable. And now, whenever friends come over and ask about their patio setup, they always recommend sling chairs first.",1,1746046708.0,ComfyChairs,0,1.0,False

While on top of it, it may look like they are harmless and just plainly stupid but - One day I was coming back from the coffee area back to the boardroom and they just called out my name, asked me to come a room alone with them and started talking about how much work pressure they have. I was under the delusion of them trying to put their work on me - but it really felt super uncomfortable.

After typing this out I realized I have a lot to share so I'm going to divide this into different days. 


Day 1: We arrive excited but tired as hell from the overnight flight. We drop our bags at the Clayton which is where we are staying, and take off to explore, too tired to sleep. 

The firt thing we needed was coffee. Our well-intended Irish concierge recommended...Starbucks. I appreciated her trying to make us feel comfortable but seeing as Limerick has a higher coffee shop to pub ratio than any town in Ireland (don't fact check me on this), after a quick Google search we found a corner that had literally FIVE coffee options in a single corner: Aroma Coffee House which looked nice and smelled amazing but was packed, Fika Coffee, Cafe Rose, Wildberry Coffee, and Esquires. We picked Wildberry by basically rolling a die, and had two very nice americanos and the staff was amazing.

We then proceeded to do the classic tourist combo of Saint Mary's and King John's Castle. Both were incredible. I took a giant poop in Saint Mary's though and felt like I committed blasphemy, but hey, if you gotta go, you gotta go. 

King John's was awesome but a bunch of construction guys were setting up a huge modern stage for some festival this weekend, Riverfest I think? And that kind of ruined the medieval ambiance, but it was still pretty epic.

*Of particular note about King John's is that it was the location of the Limerick mint. I'm an ancient and medieval coin collector so it was awesome to stand in the tower where coins were struck 800 years ago*

After King John's we decided to try out Nancy Blake's at the recommendation of a Limerick redditer. Definitely was a nice establishment but it was dead. Which kind of brings me to the first recurring theme of Limerick, WHY IS EVERYTHING GOOD HERE CLOSED ON MONDAYS AND TUESDAYS?! (Exaggeration of course) or if it's open, empty? It's like Limerick sleeps for two days a week. 

We received our first pints of Guinness at Nancy Blake's and it was embarrassing. The bartender poured 3/4ths of the Guiness and I eagerly reached out my grubby paws to drink it, and the bartender literally yelled at me ""DONT DRINK IT"" like I had just violated the Irish Ten Commandments, and he then explained to this stupid American that you have to let it settle and then top off the pint, then you can drink it. In America, the Guiness isn't nearly as fresh and basically turns black and ready to drink immediately so lesson learned. Hahaha

Anyways, we wanted live music on a Monday and the kind bartender said to try The Locke or The Still Room. We tried The Locke and it was nice and had music but very touristy vibes, so we stumbled back to our room, resolved to check out the Still Room on Tuesday, and prepared for our Cliffs of Moher day!

Find Out Here!,"ECHOGEAR EGLF2 MaxMotion TV Wall Mount for Large TVs has been my trusty companion over the past few weeks, and I've been putting it through its paces. Installing it was surprisingly easy, but a few moments during the setup made me pause and take a step back for a sip of coffee. It boasts compatibility with TVs ranging from 42 to a massive 90 inches, which is fantastic for someone like me who loves upgrading my home entertainment gear. While the mount delivered on many fronts, some things may warrant a second thought.

**User-Friendly Design**  
The design of this TV wall mount feels intuitive and well-thought-out. Its black alloy steel construction exudes minimalism while looking robust and strong enough to hold my 75-inch TV securely. There's a sense of elegance in having the TV snugly pulled back 2.4 inches from the wall. It's not bulky or over-complicated‚Äîa clean and functional piece of hardware. However, the included drilling template stole the show during installation. It saved me from second-guessing placement and made securing the mount to my wall relatively stress-free. Anyone who enjoys tinkering with hardware or has a DIY streak will appreciate the user-friendly instructions and the extensive hardware pack.

[Check ECHOGEAR EGLF2 price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b073qx1zms/)

**Performance & Adjustability**  
This wall mount flaunts an impressive ability to extend 22 inches away from the wall and swivel a fantastic 130 degrees. Testing out different angles for gaming and movie nights was fun, as it allowed perfect customization of the viewing position. The tilt feature, with up to 15 degrees of adjustment, prevents annoying glares, especially when the sun peeks through the windows at an odd angle. It performed as promised on its smooth swivel, although I noticed a tiny bit of resistance when adjusting the angles. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but something to note if you're aiming for precision in every movement.

**Good Points**  
- The heavy-gauge steel feels durable and securely supports TVs up to 125 lbs.  
- Smooth swivel and tilt functions bring flexibility for optimal viewing angles.  
- The sleek design of the mount adds a modern touch without being obtrusive.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The movement mechanism for swiveling exhibits slight resistance occasionally.  
- Drill instructions assume standard drywall; uneven walls might demand extra tools or help.  

**Target Audience**  
This wall mount caters perfectly to anyone with a larger TV‚Äîindividuals looking to maximize their living room space or elevate their home entertainment experience. If you often host viewing parties or like rearranging your furniture, the full-motion capabilities will be your best ally. However, if you have an unusual wall composition or need a no-effort installation, you might want to ensure extra compatibility checks or DIY preparation.

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve used and researched similar mounts from Sanus and Mounting Dream in the past, and though they share many common features, the product in question felt a tad more durable and better engineered for larger TVs. Sanus models tend to offer smoother movements but come at a higher price point, while Mounting Dream mounts may provide slightly better ease of installation. Where this mount shines is its all-encompassing design that's practical without breaking the bank.

**Smart Spending**  
The pricing strategy here feels reasonable for what you get‚Äîa robust, versatile, and reliable TV wall mount. Compared to lower-quality alternatives, this product hits the sweet spot of cost-effectiveness and functionality. Is it an investment? Absolutely, especially when factoring in its durability and ease of everyday use. Over time, its convenience has proved worth every penny for me personally, especially when I consider that my TV's safety and viewing ease are non-negotiable.

This guide focuses on sets of 375 cups, catering to businesses, large events, or individuals who value having a significant supply on hand.

This comprehensive review analyzes various aspects of 375-cup sets, including material quality, durability, design, and overall value.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The features of a cup set significantly impact its usability and longevity. Several key features distinguish top-tier options from inferior products.

**Material Quality:** The material used in the cups is paramount. Options range from disposable paper and plastic to reusable materials like ceramic, glass, and stainless steel. High-quality materials ensure durability, resistance to staining and odors, and overall safety for consuming hot or cold beverages. The best sets utilize food-grade materials that are free from harmful chemicals like BPA.

**Durability and Longevity:** A set of 375 cups represents a significant investment. Therefore, durability is a crucial consideration. Cups should be able to withstand regular use, dishwashing (if applicable), and potential impacts without breaking or cracking easily. Reinforced rims, sturdy construction, and high-quality materials contribute to the overall longevity of the set.

**Design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is essential, the design and aesthetics of the cups also play a role in the overall experience. Consider the shape, size, and style of the cups, ensuring they are comfortable to hold and visually appealing. Options range from classic and minimalist designs to more modern and decorative styles. A well-designed cup enhances the enjoyment of your beverage and adds a touch of elegance to any setting.

**Temperature Retention:** For those who enjoy hot beverages, temperature retention is a significant factor. Insulated cups, often made of stainless steel or double-walled materials, can keep drinks hot for extended periods. This is particularly useful for outdoor events or situations where you need to keep your beverage warm for an extended time.

Key features of the best 375-cup sets include:
    * High-quality, food-grade materials
    * Durable construction for long-lasting use
    * Variety of designs to suit different preferences
    * Excellent temperature retention for hot beverages
    * Easy to clean and maintain

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right 375-cup set offers a multitude of benefits, ranging from convenience and cost savings to improved hygiene and environmental responsibility.

**Cost Efficiency:** Purchasing cups in bulk, such as a 375-cup set, can significantly reduce the cost per cup compared to buying smaller quantities. This is particularly beneficial for businesses, organizations, or individuals who regularly use a large number of cups. The savings can be substantial over time, making a bulk purchase a financially sound decision.

**Enhanced Convenience:** Having a large supply of cups on hand eliminates the need for frequent restocking. This is especially convenient for events, parties, or busy households where running out of cups can be a major inconvenience. With 375 cups, you can be confident that you'll always have enough to meet your needs.

**Improved Hygiene:** Disposable cups offer a hygienic solution for serving beverages, as each cup is used only once, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination. This is particularly important in settings where hygiene is a top priority, such as hospitals, schools, or food service establishments. Reusable cups, when properly cleaned and sanitized, also provide a hygienic option.

**Environmental Responsibility:** While disposable cups offer convenience, they can contribute to environmental waste. Choosing reusable cups, or opting for disposable cups made from sustainable materials like compostable paper, can help reduce your environmental impact. By making conscious choices about the type of cups you use, you can contribute to a more sustainable future.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about 375-cup sets helps clarify considerations before making a purchase.

**Are 375-cup sets suitable for small households?**
  While a 375-cup set might seem excessive for a small household, it can be practical for those who frequently host gatherings or prefer to buy in bulk to save money. It also eliminates the need for frequent restocking. However, consider storage space before purchasing such a large quantity.

**What materials are commonly used in 375-cup sets?**
  Common materials include disposable options like paper and plastic, and reusable materials like ceramic, glass, stainless steel, and melamine. The choice depends on your needs, preferences, and budget. Disposable cups are convenient for events, while reusable cups are more sustainable for everyday use.

**How do I store a 375-cup set effectively?**
  Effective storage depends on the type of cups. Disposable cups can be stacked neatly in their original packaging or in storage containers. Reusable cups can be stored in cabinets or on shelves, ensuring they are clean and protected from dust. Consider using storage solutions that maximize space and keep the cups organized.

 ## Competitor Comparison

Comparing different 375-cup sets from various brands can highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each option.

### Product Comparison Overview

#### Generic Disposable Paper Cups (375 Count)
    - **Material:** Paper with a thin polyethylene lining
    - **Durability:** Suitable for single use, minimal structural integrity
    - **Heat Resistance:** Tolerates hot liquids but may become soft over time

#### EcoChoice Compostable Paper Cups (375 Count)
    - **Material:** Compostable paper with a plant-based lining
    - **Durability:** Designed for single use, breaks down in composting environments
    - **Heat Resistance:** Similar to standard paper cups, suitable for hot liquids

#### Dart Solo Plastic Cold Cups (375 Count)
    - **Material:** Polystyrene plastic
    - **Durability:** Rigid and durable for cold drinks, reusable if washed carefully

Dart Solo plastic cups are ideal for cold beverages and are more durable than paper, but are not suitable for hot drinks and contribute to plastic waste. For consumers focused on sustainability, EcoChoice is the clear winner, while budget-conscious buyers might opt for generic paper cups.

1kbqwyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1kbqwyj/the_one_who_got_away/,The One Who Got Away,"If you‚Äôve read my first story, you already know I‚Äôm not great at expressing my feelings. You‚Äôd think after losing my first love without saying anything, I‚Äôd learn my lesson, right? But life isn‚Äôt always that simple.

It was two years after my first heartbreak. I was still living in Dhaka, still figuring out my life, still trying to move on from that chapter. That‚Äôs when I met her.

Her name was Ayesha. We met at a work conference‚Äînot the kind of place you expect to find someone who changes your life. She was sitting in the row in front of me, scribbling notes with this focus that made it hard to look away. She wasn‚Äôt trying to stand out or grab attention, but somehow, she did.

We ended up in the same group during a breakout session. At first, I didn‚Äôt think she even noticed me. She was confident, always the first to speak, and had this way of making every point sound like it was the final word. Meanwhile, I was just the quiet guy in the corner, taking notes and nodding along.

But then, during a group exercise, she turned to me and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too quiet. What do you think?‚Äù

I was caught off guard, but I mumbled something halfway decent. She smiled and said, ‚ÄúGood point.‚Äù That moment‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to explain‚Äîbut it felt like she‚Äôd pulled me out of a shadow I didn‚Äôt realize I was standing in.

After the session, we went out for coffee with some of the others. She sat across from me, and we talked. She told me about her dreams of starting her own business, her love for books, and how she‚Äôd grown up in Chattogram. I told her about my love for gaming and how I was still figuring out what I wanted in life.

She laughed and said, ‚ÄúAt least you‚Äôre honest. Most people just make something up to sound impressive.‚Äù

For the first time in a long time, I felt seen.

Over the next few weeks, we stayed in touch. At first, it was work-related‚Äîsharing notes, exchanging ideas‚Äîbut it quickly turned into late-night chats about life. She had this way of making me feel like I could tell her anything, like she actually cared about what I had to say.

But as much as I wanted to tell her how I felt, I couldn‚Äôt shake the voice in my head that kept saying, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs out of your league. Don‚Äôt ruin this.‚Äù

So I stayed silent. Again.

One day, she told me she got a job offer in Chattogram. It was a big opportunity‚Äîsomething she‚Äôd been dreaming about. She was excited, and I could tell she was already imagining her new life there.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I kept thinking about what I should do. Should I tell her? Should I just let her go? Every time I tried to picture myself confessing my feelings, all I could see was her laughing awkwardly, telling me she didn‚Äôt feel the same.

The day before she left, we met for coffee one last time. She thanked me for being such a good friend and said she‚Äôd always remember our talks. I nodded, smiled, and said, ‚ÄúOf course. I‚Äôll miss you.‚Äù

I wanted to say more. I wanted to tell her everything‚Äîthat she wasn‚Äôt just a friend to me, that she made me feel alive in a way I hadn‚Äôt felt in years. But the words stayed stuck in my throat.

She left the next day.

We kept in touch for a while‚Äîsporadic texts and the occasional call‚Äîbut eventually, life got in the way. The messages slowed down, and one day, they stopped altogether.

Now, years later, I still think about her sometimes. I wonder if she ever thought of me the way I thought of her. I wonder what would‚Äôve happened if I‚Äôd just said something. Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt have changed anything, but at least I‚Äôd know.

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned from all this, it‚Äôs that silence isn‚Äôt strength. It‚Äôs fear. And fear has cost me too much already.

So, to anyone reading this‚Äîif you care about someone, tell them. Don‚Äôt be like me. Don‚Äôt let them become just another ‚Äúwhat if.‚Äù",2,1746045937.0,Dhaka,0,1.0,False

Penn State College of Medicine (Hershey, PA)

- Tuition is more expensive at $60k/year, though I haven‚Äôt received a financial aid award yet, so that may change.

- I currently live in Baltimore, so it wouldn‚Äôt be a big shift ‚Äî it‚Äôs only about 1.5 hours away.

- My partner will be in Hagerstown, MD, and I also have family in Baltimore and New York, so I‚Äôd be close to them.

- I‚Äôm used to the more mild weather here and really enjoy the outdoors ‚Äî there‚Äôs great access to hiking and nature in the area.

- Even though it‚Äôs a small town, I like that I‚Äôd still have access to large cities for day trips.

- Offers a three-year accelerated program in a specialty I‚Äôm interested in, and a smaller cohort program at their University Park campus that would take about $20k/year off tuition ‚Äî though neither option is guaranteed, so I can‚Äôt fully count on them.

University of Florida College of Medicine (Gainesville, FL)

- Tuition is currently $25k/year with the aid they‚Äôve offered me.

- I have a lot of family in South Florida, so I‚Äôd be closer to them, though they‚Äôre still about 5‚Äì6 hours away by car, so visits would likely be less frequent.

- The Florida heat and humidity are pretty uncomfortable for me, so that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been seriously considering.

- Curriculum and clinical opportunities seem comparable to Penn State, and they also have strong home residency programs.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure which specialty I‚Äôll go into, but right now I‚Äôm interested in psychiatry, neurology, physical medicine, and orthopedics. That could all change though, so I‚Äôm not sure how much that should factor into my decision.

I don‚Äôt mind living in small towns as long as I have access to small gyms, yoga studios, saunas, museums, bookstores, diverse restaurants, and good coffee shops and workspaces.

1kbquta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1kbquta/feeling_static/,Feeling Static,"I‚Äôm currently 19 and attending the film program at my community college. My ultimate goal is  be a film director, writer, and editor. The thing is, I feel like the clock is running down and I haven‚Äôt made any meaningful progress towards my goals. The program at my school says that film majors would be taking 6 semesters of classes before they graduate, but I‚Äôm 2 semesters in now and at the pace I‚Äôm going at I‚Äôll probably finish in 4. I feel like there‚Äôs so little time before I need to at least have my foot in the door. I know I‚Äôm not just gonna jump in the director‚Äôs chair straight out of community college, but I‚Äôd like to at least have something lined up.
The thing about my film program is that it seems bent on keeping you in the classroom instead of working on projects. And even when we do have projects, it‚Äôs things like doing a local news story or a commercial, and I probably won‚Äôt get the chance to work on an actual short film for an assignment until my last semester , which seems weird to me. I feel like it‚Äôs common knowledge that experience is the best teacher, yet this school seems so opposed to creating an environment where we can get meaningful experience that pertains to what we want to do.
On top of that, it‚Äôs kind of difficult for me to find friends to work on projects with outside of class assignments because I feel like there‚Äôs a gap in skill, experience, and passion between my classmates and I. I‚Äôm not trying to sound cocky or arrogant, but when we present our video assignment to the class, it‚Äôs clear that I have more experience than most other people in the class (I used to make YouTube videos in middle school and high school, so I‚Äòve known premiere pro for 5+ years and have basic knowledge of filming and lighting, whereas my classmates are mostly learning how to edit in this class). I just feel (and I‚Äôm really not trying to be insulting) that even if I were friends with my classmates, I wouldn‚Äôt really be able to rely on them for help. Not to mention the fact that half my class dropped out of it in the first half of the semester because they didn‚Äôt complete their beginner‚Äôs editing assignments and didn‚Äôt want to fail the class, I just feel like there‚Äôs not a lot of options for me to work on my own short films in or outside of class.
I‚Äôve applied to a pretty acclaimed university to attend next fall, but I don‚Äôt get my results back until mid-late June. The city I live in doesn‚Äôt have many opportunities for student filmmakers to get on sets because movies aren‚Äôt really filmed here (which may possibly change in the coming years, but I don‚Äôt know for sure if it will and I‚Äôd rather not sit around waiting to find out). I feel like going to this university is my only option now if I really want to do this because I may be able to meet peers who are just as passionate as me. I know film school isn‚Äôt necessary to be a filmmaker and there are plenty of filmmakers who haven‚Äôt gone to film school, but it seems like they often had a community of people who were also passionate about being in film, or lived in an area where there were opportunities to get on sets, neither of which I really have.
Overall I just feel lost and like I‚Äôm not making progress towards my goals. I really love film and would love to get a crappy PA job, even if it means grabbing coffee for the crew if it meant I would get to be on a set.

The retail giant has delivered another solid quarter of sales growth but warns budget-conscious consumers are going meat free a couple of times a week and going back to tap water.

Coles says Australians are becoming more frugal and less loyal to a particular supermarket brand as they struggle to balance their budgets by trading down to cheaper groceries.

Chief executive Leah Weckert said customers were cutting back on treats, alcohol, meat and bottled water amid continuing cost of living pressures. They are also draining their loyalty points to reduce bills at the checkout.

‚ÄúThey may be going meat free a couple of times a week and going back to tap water instead of purchasing bottles,‚Äù said Ms Weckert. Coles on Wednesday reported sales of $10.4bn for the March quarter, up 3.4 per cent from a year earlier.

The supermarket giant navigated several severe weather events during the period, including flooding in Far North Queensland in February and the impacts of Cyclone Alfred on Southeast Queensland and Northern NSW in March.

Coles booked $9.4bn in sales from its supermarkets, a 3.7 per cent increase. Excluding tobacco, the result was an increase of 4.7 per cent. eCommerce sales rose by 25.7 per cent to $1.1bn.

Consumers are more prepared to shop at a greater variety of retailers to get the best prices, which Ms Weckert described as a significant change in consumer behaviour.

‚ÄúIf you go back a couple of years, customers would shop around at three or four retailers during the course of a month,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNow that number is closer to seven or eight.

‚ÄúSo there is an increasing propensity to drive around and use their own time to get the best prices. For less urgent items such as washing detergent and cleaning products, people are stretching out the time between purchases.‚Äù

Asked about accusations from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of supermarket price gouging and other anti-competitive behaviour, Ms Weckert said the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission had not found any evidence of such practices.

‚ÄúWe should not be surprised when so many Australians are concerned with getting the budget to balance, that it is a strong conversation for us as a nation,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúBut I think what was really pleasing coming out of the ACCC report is that they didn‚Äôt find any evidence of price gouging.

‚ÄúIn fact, they identified the biggest drivers of price increases had been fuel, energy and commodity prices.

‚ÄúActually grocery prices in Australia compared to other developed nations including the UK, Canada, EU and the US have gone up less and that talks to the degree of competition that we have here in Australia.‚Äù

Ms Weckert said customers were looking at a variety of measures to cut costs, including cashing in flybuys points to reduce their weekly shopping bill.

One promotion that resonated was for a range of Curtis Stone glass containers in a sign that people were cooking more at home and not wanting to waste food. ‚ÄúThese Curtis Stone containers are really coming into their own because you have an effective way to cook in bulk and then store it by freezing or putting it into the fridge for a couple of days,‚Äù Ms Weckert said.

While some categories, including packaged food, were seeing price reductions, meat, fresh produce and coffee continued to rise due to weather events and production costs.

The Coles boss said there may be some light at the end of tunnel for consumers suffering from rising food prices. ‚ÄúIf you went to the period of 2022 or 2023, there were elevated levels of inflation on supermarket prices, and they got to around 6 per cent to 7 per cent,‚Äù Ms Weckert said.

‚ÄúIn our result today, we are reporting pricing inflation, excluding tobacco, of only 1.1 per cent, which is significantly below the Reserve Bank target rate.‚Äù

Ms Weckert said the retailer was watching the impact of the unfolding US tariff wars on consumer behaviour. ‚ÄúAny direct impact on the company is likely to be minimal,‚Äù she said.

Coles has edged slightly ahead of rival Woolworths as the preferred supermarket for Australians as it ramps up pressure on its arch rival in the key battlefields of fresh food and discounting.

New shopper data from UBS released last week shows Woolworths and IGA are losing ground to Coles in terms of the number of trips to the supermarket for both dry groceries and fresh food. Coles has 34 per cent of ‚Äúnext 10‚Äù trips for dry groceries compared with 33 per cent for Woolworths and 28 per cent of fresh-food visits against 27 per cent for Woolworths.

The ‚Äúnext 10‚Äù refers to the 10 shopping trips that will occur in the immediate future, focusing on dry grocery items like canned goods, packaged snacks, and non-perishable staples.

Coles shares fell 0.8 per cent to $21.22 on Wednesday.

Why do we consume caffeine to get through the work day, when we‚Äôre essentially just stealing the energy from the far more important part of the day, the time we spend with friends, family or the other things that bring us joy?

It‚Äôs kinda like that alcohol saying, ‚Äúgetting drunk is borrowing tomorrow happiness‚Äù. Instead of just using what energy we have from 9-5, we‚Äôre taking this drug to borrow that energy from later on and use it all up at work so we can be even more ‚Äúproductive‚Äù for our employer. Then there‚Äôs no energy left when the day/shift ends. You‚Äôre worn out and all you want to do is mindlessly watch your screen as your body so badly needs to recharge, yet you‚Äôre still to wired properly rest and recover. 

For me when I had multiple coffees to try be as productive as possible, though I was likely just ‚Äúbusier‚Äù doing nonsense and feeling productive. I finish then at 5:00ish with my brain now mush and have little left for the best part of the day.

Why on earth do we pour almost all the days energy into the work part of the day instead the part of our life that actually matters?

We shouldn‚Äôt, which is one of the many reasons we quit this addictive drug. Save that energy for something better.

1kbqore,https://www.reddit.com/r/chuck/comments/1kbqore/chuck_vs_the_world_6/,Chuck vs the World 6,"Chapter 12

They flew off a carrier in the Persian Gulf. Using the fastest helicopter they could muster, it was to be a short trip to collect an Iranian defector. She had nuclear intel that the USA needed to thwart Iran‚Äôs plans to acquire nuclear weapons. Her location was known. They would pick her up just outside of Tehran.

Beckman had assigned Sarah and Chuck to the job strictly due to Chucks flashes on the Iranian asset. He was aware of her, constantly was updating on her and advising the pilot where to fly and where to land.

The twins were walking by then. They were two years old and Sarah was working on potty training them. As soon as she realised that Chuck was to be sent on a mission she put her foot down.

‚ÄúHe never leaves me behind! Never! I‚Äôll keep him home, Beckman! I‚Äôll make him wish he never had to leave the house and you know I can do that! I go on any mission Chuck goes on. That‚Äôs the deal.‚Äù She folded her arms and glowered at the General. She was glowered right back at, but finally Beckman nodded. Sarah could go along to collect the Iranian.

The Navy was hesitant to use Chuck in such a dangerous job. The CIA had to be convinced to do it. Meetings at high levels were held. DARPA was called in for contingency planning. All of the hand wringing went on invisibly to Sarah Walker. Chuck was wearing digital glasses to keep his brain updated with intel the whole time he was in the helicopter. He had a satellite feed from the Castle. Casey was right beside him on one side and Sarah was on his other side. The cyber girls were feeding him real-time data. Chuck was speaking through coms to Casey and Sarah on weather conditions, what time of night it was, terrain for the pickup location, any heat signatures he saw, radar blips he picked up, the times for flight, pickup and return‚Ä¶Chuck was absorbed in his work.

A pair of headlights flashed in the dark. The chopper turned on powerful landing lights and swung about to land. As the skids touched the ground, something blew the tail right off the helicopter. Sarah dove out the door with her weapon on fully automatic. Her head snapped back and she was down. Chuck dove on top of her in a shielding action. Casey and the pilot opened fire on a muzzle flash from on top of a sandy rise. Heavy machine gun fire rained down on their position. A mortar lobbed shells close to them. The helicopter dissolved into a ball of flames. Shattered rotors and parts exploded outwards. Casey yelled into his radio with GPS data for an airstrike. It took ten long minutes for a ball of flame to happen at the top of the hill.

Ten more minutes for another helicopter to show up for an evac. Navy jets streaked across the sky. The Bartowskis were medi-vac‚Äôed out. Casey took a round in the hip. He shot the three men who appeared from the night. The chopper took off with a door gunner using a rotary barrelled machine gun against an Iranian APC. The APC landed a few rounds but the helicopter managed to take off with its wounded cargo. It was smoking badly by the time it got back to the carrier. DARPA descended and Chucks body was carried off to a curtained section of a below-decks hangar. Casey was knocked out for surgery. Sarah was watched over by General Beckman. Her helmet had taken a round from an AK-47. A medical scan showed no skull fractures. She should have woken up. Beckman sat beside her precious assassin. Of all the times she had had to inform families of the passing of their loved ones, this was the one she dreaded the most. Sarah was held together by the love of Chuck Bartowski. His loss was going to have unpredictable results on his wife.

To date, Sarah had never recovered. In a rare lucid moment, she said to Beckman;

‚ÄúOne half of my soul is gone. I‚Äôm different without Chuck and I don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù

For her own survival, Sarah had to bury her emotions. This had always worked for her. During the week between the Iranian firefight and Chuck‚Äôs funeral, she was focussed and relatively placid. She took care of the babies. She fed herself. She wrote her version of the report on the failed mission. There had never been an Iranian defector. The American intelligence establishment had been totally fooled by the Iranians. When the enemies of the USA found out that Chuck was dead, there was great jubilation. The cyber girls took over most of the computer security work that Chuck had been doing, but they were less effective than he had been. The Intersect could not be implanted in either of them. They simply didn‚Äôt fit the profile.

Chuck‚Äôs funeral was where it all ended for Sarah. She saw Morgan simply fall apart in grief. Casey, in a wheelchair, wept unreservedly. Ellie was on sedatives and Devon was grim. Lester was pale and withdrawn. Jeff Barnes was conspicuously absent. The grandmothers had to be helped from the graveside. Sarah was dressed in black by General Beckman herself. She stood beside it until the grave was filled. Beautiful and suffering, she mentally entered a void so dark that no psychologist, psychiatrist or therapist could reach her. The iron mental control derived from CIA training morphed into a merciless disregard for all human life. Carina met Sarah one more time after Chucks funeral. She was shocked at the change. Gone was the vivacious, loving and over-the-top dedicated wife. She was replaced by a cold, hard, cynical spy who lived for vengeance. Medication followed, and the glass enclosure.

Sarah was used to clean out all of the Iranian operatives who were known to be in the States. Whenever red work needed to be done, Sarah was the one who was placed with a weapon to do it. Out cold on Halcion, she would be transported to a location, woken up and informed of the target. Her unarmed combat skills were so superb that often she never needed firearms to kill the target. It was Casey who suggested the Halcion. He had seen it used on paratroopers to keep them asleep and to program their awakening just before they had to jump. Sarah was so dangerous that transporting her to a target‚Äôs location was too risky for the personnel involved, without Halcion.

Casey had seen Sarah, dressed in an exquisite black velvet evening gown, looking so eye-catchingly beautiful that men‚Äôs heads turned as she walked by, walk up behind a man who had sold hi-tech weapons plans to the Chinese and slide a needle into his skull. There had been a soiree at a foreign embassy, with a baroque quartet playing music, servers with trays distributing canap√©s and drinks, dancing and animated conversations between diplomats. It had been high-brow and attended by intelligentsia from many nations, in New York City. Casey noted that Sarah‚Äôs facial expression never changed as she killed the man. Unobtrusively, unhesitatingly, swiftly and unnoticed, she walked past him and he died. The needle dissolved in his flesh. She was in a coma within the hour and transported back to the glass enclosure. Over two hundred ways of killing a man.

For Sarah, no memories remained after a kill. The drugs dispensed to her kept her in a permanent state of¬† numbness. They governed her awareness, her sleep, her intensity in her training. It was after her first mission, after Chuck was gone, that she was in her place of rest, her dream cathedral, that on the golden altar which was so beautifully carved in floral patterns with ornate crosses, she noticed a new item, a vase. It held a single midnight rose. Between the thorns on the stem was a label with the number ‚Äòone‚Äô. She wondered what it meant. When seven ebony roses were in a single vase, another vase appeared. Each flower was numbered. When she mentioned it to the psychiatrist who had her case, he said that it was her sub conscience keeping score. The answer didn‚Äôt satisfy her. She was left with the feeling that somebody else was keeping score. And that somehow, the inside of the dream cathedral was never meant to be decorated with festoons of midnight roses.

Lester couldn‚Äôt find Jeff. The other half of Jeffster was gone without a trace. Up until Chuck had passed away, Jeff was always present. Lester listened to Morgan try to explain to the employees who weren‚Äôt in the CIA loop, why Chuck was dead and would never be seen in the Buy More. Where to attend the funeral, what to wear to a funeral, how the funeral would go, to be aware of the twenty-one gun salute, the jet fighter fly-by, how there would be a lot of men in uniform present, not to approach Sarah, the location of the wake and the schedule of the ceremony‚Ä¶he finally wrote out a memo and posted it on the lunch room bulletin board. They all thought that Jeff should be there, but he was never seen.

Ellie and Devon took the twins. They were switched to formula and gradually, solid food. They grew to be well adjusted children who listened to their new parents. Devon noted that Ellie never stopped grieving over the loss of her brother. She would stop whatever she was doing, wipe away a tear and carry on. They knew Sarah was still alive but asked for no more information than that. Both of them had seen Sarah at her best with Chuck, but had also seen her at her combative worst in the fights they had been exposed to. Beckman, upon delivering the children to them, simply said that Sarah had reverted back to who she had been before Chuck. The Woodcombs listened in sadness.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Daddy and Mummy?‚Äù asked five year old Rory. He was just getting his orange belt in Goju Ryu karate. He had passed the test with flying colours and for some reason, he expected his parents to watch him. Devon saw Ellie start to fall apart, so he hurriedly stepped in to answer.

‚ÄúYour parents couldn‚Äôt make it, Son. But they‚Äôre really proud of you. And they love you just so much.‚Äù Rory accepted his step-father‚Äôs hug. He held his face to Devon‚Äôs neck and hugged as hard as he could. That was what Uncle Casey called a ‚ÄòRussian Hug‚Äô. Millie and Rory always made sure to give Russian hugs. Uncle Morgan was the one who would fly into Chicago to visit them. He always took them for ice cream. He was an unfailing source of chocolates and candies. The twins always arrived back at their home after a visit from Uncle Morgan completely wired on caffeine and sugar. Ellie would raise her eyebrows at Morgan, which he ignored as he had for years. As far as he could figure out, it was his job to spoil the Bartowski twins as much as possible. The secret of Chuck‚Äôs revival weighed heavily on Morgan, but if he had learned one thing from his exposure to espionage, it was that secrets had to be kept. He ached for the chance to relieve Ellie‚Äôs grief over losing Chuck, but was forbidden to do so.

Chapter 13

Devon Woodcomb was an athlete and not a sports fan, generally. Buying tickets to Wrigley Field to watch a game by the Chicago Cubs wasn‚Äôt something he would do normally, but the twins had never seen a professional baseball team and neither had Clara Woodcomb, their older sister. Devon knew that the slow pace of baseball was not going to entrance such young children, but it was a form of American culture they needed to experience. He had made sure Clara had her I-pad, that the twins had colouring books and a few toys, Ellie wasn‚Äôt in the midst of a crisis at work and he wasn‚Äôt slated for surgery. So, he looked forward to an uneventful but enjoyable afternoon, watching baseball.

Rory had fallen asleep on his sister. She was nodding her head and catching herself as she nodded sleepily. It was the bottom of the ninth, the bases were loaded and the Cubs were down two runs. Tension was high for the fans. Tension was non-existent for the Bartowski twins. Clara Woodcomb looked down at her I-pad and was surprised to see a message on it. She knew it wasn‚Äôt connected up to a cellular system or wi-fi, so where did the message come from? Her mother‚Äôs cell phone beeped that a text message had come in as Clara passed her I-pad over to her. Devon‚Äôs cell phone went off at the same moment. To their collective shock, the messages were the same on both phones and the I-pad.

‚ÄúKnock, knock.‚Äù Ellie and Devon‚Äôs eyes met. Ellie pointed at the Wrigley Field jumbo Tron. Across the screen, in huge letters was the message;

‚ÄúKnock, knock.‚Äù A camera zoomed in on the Woodcombs as they sat in the stands. The people around them cheered them on as they were expected to kiss or cheer in response to the attention. Instead, Ellie and Devon sat in stunned silence. Their faces were now on the jumbo Tron looking back blankly. Ellie cleared her throat.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here,‚Äù she said. It echoed around the stadium.

Two black disks suddenly appeared over the crowd. They hovered in front of the Woodcombs seat level in the center of the field. Festooned with weaponry, they pointed at them. Devon saw them rotate slightly to look at the twins. He put his arms around them protectively. A new message popped up on the jumbo Tron.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt freak out‚Ä¶Chuck Bartowski.‚Äù Ellie screamed in anguish. She hadn‚Äôt seen or heard Chucks name since his funeral. Who would play such a cruel trick on her? And how did they get onto two cell phones and an I-pad? Again, the jumbo Tron changed messages.

‚ÄúI am the Singularity. I am the Intersect. I am Chuck Bartowski. I am coming.‚Äù Ellie collapsed and fainted. Devon was sobbing. All of the people close to them in the stands were shouting questions at them. The children began crying in fear. A man went to comfort the children. He was a stranger but was being parentally kind. One of the discs was suddenly six feet away from him. It pointed at him menacingly. A voice spoke from the disk;

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move. Don‚Äôt approach my children. I will end you.‚Äù Devon knew then. It was Chuck‚Äôs voice. This wasn‚Äôt a hoax. This was real. He looked at the disk;

‚ÄúChuck? Is that you? How is this possible?‚Äù The disk was silent. It was focussed on the man who had gone to help the children. He shook in fear. Across the jumbo Tron came the words;

‚ÄúTalk to Morgan Grimes.‚Äù Then, as quickly as they appeared the disks were gone. There was a collective gasp from the baseball fans. The entire incident had been caught on CCTV and recorded. It had also been broadcast over live television. The headlines varied from;

‚ÄúUFO‚Äôs attack American baseball!‚Äù to;

‚ÄúAliens are Chicago Cub fans! The National League is the favourite of the universe!‚Äù

The Woodcombs were instant celebrities. They were also on the radar of all of the US government security departments. A crowd of agents showed up at their house demanding answers. Devon was confused on what to say, since he thought Chuck was long dead. He stood outside of the house as agents and reporters all shouted questions at him. That all ended when a black limousine pulled up and General Beckman got out of it. A large contingent of CIA operatives moved the crowd away with aggression. An infuriated FBI agent went for his pistol and found himself staring into a plethora of automatic weapons. He wisely withdrew his hand from his jacket.

General Beckman entered the Woodcomb house to brief them on what she knew so far. Ellie was alternately afraid or infuriated. How was her brother alive? Where was he? Who had they buried five years ago? As Beckman prepared to answer, Lester and Morgan were hauled by agents up the front steps and into the house. Beckman snarled at them. Lester came close to peeing himself, but Morgan just shrugged;

‚ÄúHey, c‚Äômon Ellie, Chuck and I are best friends. He tells me everything.‚Äù Ellie grabbed him by his collar and screamed into his face;

‚ÄúChuck is dead! We buried him! What did you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing, really. Chuck did it all himself. I‚Äôm kind‚Äôa proud of him. He‚Äôs so cool.‚Äù Beckman pulled Ellie off Morgan. She was shaking in fury. Somebody had desecrated her brother‚Äôs memory. Morgan was usually to blame for everything in Ellie‚Äôs eyes. He wisely put the general between himself and Ellie. A Bartowski on the warpath was best kept at a safe distance. It took two hours for the Woodcombs to be brought up to speed on what had happened to Ellie‚Äôs beloved brother. At the end of it all, Ellie had turned from fury to sullen acceptance. She waited until all of the agents were gone. It was then that she phoned John Casey.

‚ÄúYeah. So, for the past five years I had to listen to Chuck just scream. I‚Äôm sorry Ellie. I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt just end it all by pulling the plug. But, I‚Äôm telling you, I‚Äôve talked to him and it‚Äôs really Chuck now. When he was just a digital file, he just wanted Sarah. If they could of spoken to each other, maybe there would have been some healing. But Sarah is bat-shit crazy. I should of seen it coming. Without Chuck, she‚Äôs just nuts. I knew her before Chuck came along. Just a stone killer. Her red test ruined her as a human being. Chuck‚Äôs love healed her. You helped by being her friend. And here I am, stuck in the middle. Sarah doesn‚Äôt know about Chuck yet. And she‚Äôs so medicated I don‚Äôt know if she could handle it. But I‚Äôm sorry I couldn‚Äôt tell you, Ellie. Orders, y‚Äôknow? Orders.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo where do we go from here? He has flying saucers? And he threatened to kill a guy for trying to help with the kids yesterday. Devon saw it. Chuck wouldn‚Äôt kill anybody.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me, Ellie, he would. He killed over a hundred mercenaries who were a threat to Sarah. He‚Äôs the same Chuck but different. DARPA had better watch their ass. We wanted to send some people to that graphite mine in northern Canada, but got shut down by the Canadian federal government. They have it under guard but refuse to open it. I don‚Äôt blame them. Morgan and Lester tell me the whole mechanism inside looked like a live organism, the way it moved. They were spooked by it. Chuck appears to be ahead in technology by a country mile, compared to everybody. He has access to the latest and greatest computer tech, AI tech, weapons tech and he‚Äôs improved it all. Those disks you saw? Yeah, the DARPA guys say they break a few of the laws of physics.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe killed how many people? That‚Äôs not Chuck. He sees the best in everybody.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe shot Daniel Shaw.‚Äù Casey wondered how much Ellie actually knew about the incident.¬†

‚ÄúI spoke to Sarah. She said Shaw was trying to kill her. He was going to throw her off a bridge and my brother shot him. Good for him! Shaw had no excuse for killing Sarah. He just couldn‚Äôt have her so he went all nasty! And then! He comes back! And hurts Sarah again! Chuck didn‚Äôt shoot him well enough. I love Sarah. Chuck loved, or loves, or whatever‚Ä¶Sarah.‚Äù Casey was silent for a moment, trying to ascertain how much Ellie could be told. He had so many secrets that he was often lost in them. He knew Shaw was still alive. He was locked away, never to see the light of day ever again, but Shaw was still alive. Until South America, Chuck had never killed anybody. So, Ellie didn‚Äôt know that Sarah had killed Shaw‚Äôs wife. Well, Casey wasn‚Äôt going to be the one who told her.

Casey had nothing to add to what Ellie already knew, so they rang off. Casey handed Sarah her meds through a slot in the glass enclosure. She knocked them back with a glass of water. It was time for bed. Casey watched her as she lay down and doused the lights. She had two speakers on¬† the sides of her bed. She liked to listen to nature recordings of birds, or water in a stream, or the wind blowing that helped her to sleep. These were slightly discernable through the enclosure. Casey had tuned them out long ago. He had to get up and use the bathroom early in the morning. As he made his way back, he heard a male voice from Sarah‚Äôs sleeping area. It was speaking softly to her. Just barely able to make it out, Casey couldn‚Äôt hear the words it spoke. For the first time in as long as he had guarded her, Casey saw a slight smile on Sarah‚Äôs face. The voice stopped and the sounds of loons calling slowly rose. Casey walked past a flatscreen monitor. It flickered, and across it came the words;

‚ÄúKnock, knock.‚Äù

Chapter 14

Chuck built himself an atom at a time. He reused the failures. He experimented, he tried again and again to create himself. ¬†It took much longer than he thought it would. Making the flying disks was easy compared to making himself. Failure was not an option. His love for Sarah drove him on. In universities around the world, he had students run experiments that he couldn‚Äôt run himself. Sarah was suffering. She was never meant to be a stone cold killer. She was meant to love Chuck Bartowski. He had seen her in South America. He had gazed at her through the black discs. She was a camouflaged warrior. More than anything else, Chuck just wanted to sit and talk with her. They had so much fun just talking about their shared future. She had been so slow to come out of her CIA shell. He had tried to get involved with other women, but none of them could match her. She was the one. He was trying his best to get to her, one atom at a time.

At the end of a year, he was half-way there. Carbon was only the beginning, he had to use other elements to create himself. By the time he had figured out how to build himself, he had worked his way through the entire periodic table. Using light to move atoms resulted in an assembly platform that resembled a rainbow sphere. Colours continually exploded across it with showers of globes of lesser size rising like soap bubbles and dissipating in the coal black of the graphite mine. He filmed the process and sent it to Morgan. Only Morgan carried the deepest knowledge of Chuck‚Äôs building and return. He knew of all the false starts, the errors, the recycling of precious pure carbon. He also had to suffer through the whining of his sensitive friend as he was questioned about his children and Sarah. They spoke via an earpiece as Morgan managed the Buy More.

‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs okay, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell Chuck, she just gets used for wet work, Buddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd is she drugged up otherwise?‚Äù

‚ÄúYup. I never knew her back before you changed her, but Casey says she used to just be an assassin. The best of the lot. She used her beauty to get close to the target and then wham-o! She can lie and kill and never change expression. Even Casey doesn‚Äôt trust her. She‚Äôs scary, Dude.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan, that‚Äôs sad. How are Rory and Millie? How are they doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, Ellie won‚Äôt let me spend too much time with them, not after the chocolate-covered coffee bean incident. But, from a distance, they‚Äôre doing okay. Rory takes after his mother, what with the karate and all. Millie seems to love dollies and making friends at daycare. There‚Äôs a pair of red-headed twin girls who greet her every morning she gets dropped off. Rory got in trouble from beating up a little guy who wanted to bully Millie. I mean Rory and the guy were the same size, y‚Äôknow, but Rory thumped him in the chest with his elbow. If you get him mad, he‚Äôll have the same expression Sarah gets when she gets mad. Hey, remember that You-tuber who wanted you so bad? The one with the striped hair?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. That didn‚Äôt end well. I wonder if Ellie knew that those Intersect upgrades would cause Sarah to get so jealous? Geez, I‚Äôd never cheat. That was so unfair.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh poor you! Having a gorgeous woman like Sarah Walker all ballistic jealous over you. Poor fellow! I haven‚Äôt gotten laid since Alex moved out.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo? At least you‚Äôre not dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yeah, there‚Äôs that, I guess. Okay, you‚Äôre ahead on that score. So, how‚Äôs the A.I. working out?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind‚Äôve like having a tool in my hand, only I‚Äôm the tool. I can get into any system in the world. Military systems, aerospace systems, industrial systems, whatever‚Ä¶It grows and learns all the time. But it‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm it. Hey! Morgan! How‚Äôd you like the discs over the baseball game?‚Äô

‚ÄúNot cool Chuck. You almost gave your sister a heart attack. I got raked over the coals by General Beckman. And I stayed away from Ellie. You better wait a while before you call her. Devon is messed up, man. And you never told me about the South American job. You never used to kill people. What happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúSarah was in trouble. I solved the issue.‚Äù

‚ÄúBy killing all those guys?‚Äù

‚ÄòNo other way out. They all had guns. Sarah was cornered. That‚Äôs my Sarah, she‚Äôll always be my Sarah. She‚Äôs my port in the storm, Morgan.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously? You‚Äôre comparing Sarah Walker to a form of sanctuary? She‚Äôs the one who needs the safe harbour. And you‚Äôre supposed to be it, Dude.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I am it. I‚Äôm the safe harbour.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot if you‚Äôre killing whole divisions, one at a time.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt that many guys, Morgan!‚Äù

‚ÄúI gotta serve a customer, Chuck. Where‚Äôd Lester go? Oh yeah, a remote install. Some server farm. It needs a whole new electrical grid. He was waiting for the hydro guys to come in and hook it up. Hey Lady! What do you need? A turkey roaster? Yup, three different kinds over in aisle three. You‚Äôre welcome. Choose one and I‚Äôll carry it to your car. Still there Chuck?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Where can I go?‚Äù

‚ÄúStill no body, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sort‚Äôve stuck on the neural system. I have a couple of Chinese universities working on it. They don‚Äôt know that, of course, but I‚Äôm just saying‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought A.I. was the answer to all of mankind‚Äôs problems.‚Äù

‚ÄúNope. It just raises more difficult questions. Vale! Vicky, Vicky, Vicky Vale! I miss the days when all I had to do was fix the odd cell phone. And rescue baby ballerinas.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn front of gorgeous blondes?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. It worked out.‚Äù

‚ÄúTook five years.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Hey, my arm‚Äôs done. Fingers all work. Neural feedback is better than my original.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, you gonna let me go to work? I have a Buy More to run, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúYup. Talk later?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways here for you Chuck.‚Äù

He was alone again. This was a form of exquisite torture. Morgan had a life to live. Ellie and Devon had lives to live. Casey wasn‚Äôt prone to long telephone conversations. Chuck felt like his pool of friends was shrinking. And why not? He‚Äôd been gone for five years.

His new body, synthetic though it might be, had to work better than the original. With the influence of the Intersect software, his hands were more sensitive, his senses were more refined, he saw more colours, he thought more clearly and at an unimaginable (to him) rate of speed. His outer skin could feel far more than a normal human. As he slowly assembled himself, he took note of the enhanced reaction speed, the increase in physical strength, the endurance that never flagged and the spatial awareness that came from being basically, one big sensor.

Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Godin had nothing on Chuck Bartowski. He made himself a work of art. Sarah‚Äôs influence, although primarily for herself, had made him into a handsome man with a chiselled physique. It took almost twice as long as he thought it would to build him, but when he looked in the mirror and shone a light in the pitch black of the graphite mine, Chuck 2 was magnificent. He tested the new body to the limit, reined it back in for his own safety‚Äôs sake, set limits on energy outputs‚Ä¶and got dressed in a green, Buy More t-shirt with blue jeans and loafers. He combed his hair. Brushed his teeth. Ate a microwaved meal, drank a beer (no effect) and walked around the mine in the dark. It was time for a field test run.

The mine was being guarded by the cream of the Canadian military. He snuck past them through a ventilation shaft in the top of the mine. It was mid-winter in northern Manitoba, but he was charged up and wouldn‚Äôt need a boost for a year, so he just walked into the nearest town. He could have run the whole distance at high speed, but he enjoyed the walk in the dark. Animals moved in the forest around him. He saw them all in levels of the spectrum. His breath streamed like mist behind him as he walked. Even the stars in the night sky were enhanced. The northern lights seemed to sing over his head. Wraith-like curtains of ionic light blazed and faded against the saw-tooth forest skyline. Beauty poured into him. He pondered it‚Äôs source. He pondered love. How did his love for Sarah and the twins cause him to be walking through a snowy wilderness in the winter dark? His new body was poetry in motion. He came to town.

Not much of a place, Roarkville, Manitoba. One main street, a grocery store, a bakery, a beer store, a Tim Hortons, and a bar. He walked into the bar. It was bright, crowded and noisy. He toned down his senses from wilderness level to crowded-room level. Loggers and miners, truckers and heavy equipment operators, foresters and geologists, sawmill workers and the occasional government workers. Few women versus men, this being northern Canada. The women present all had rings on their fingers and husbands by their sides. He had seen a team of sled dogs tied up outside. So, there was a trapper in here somewhere.

‚ÄúHey Buddy! Dressed kind‚Äôa light fer the weather, aint‚Äôcha?‚Äù A huge bearded man turned from his place at the bar to greet him. He was dressed in a parka with a couple of jackshirts beneath it. Chuck grinned at him.

‚ÄúWell hey, I‚Äôm American, we just don‚Äôt feel the cold.‚Äù

‚ÄúGrab a beer! Yankees are welcome, eh.‚Äù

Chuck chatted away with the various men who were all curious as to where he‚Äôd come from (Burbank, California), what kind of work he did (high-tech computers), if he was married and was he moving the family up here? Nope, not yet. Could his wife cook? Was she amenable to having guys over for dinner? Did he know how to skin a coyote? Splitting firewood was for the birds, but it had to be done, eh. And how you could never shut off a diesel engine in this weather, cause it would never restart. The price of lumber and metals, the high taxes, the problem of getting doctors to come to this place, how awful American beer was (although many seemed to drink it), how the team was doing this year (hockey, not baseball), how the Mounties had just brought a new female officer in, and she was a looker! But awfully mean with the speeding tickets. Who‚Äôd get to her first? And that new grade school teacher? She had a nice voice. That summed up her appearance. Chuck idly wondered what effect Sarah in full makeup and a nice outfit would have had if she‚Äôd walked in. Or his sister? Pandemonium, he supposed. The bar would have dissolved into punch-outs. Closing time came, and the place closed. Chuck ran back to the graphite mine and went back in as he‚Äôd come out. Not a soldier saw him. He called Morgan but he was out on the prowl in Los Angeles.

He had to be patient. This was a given, and he accepted the fact, but he chafed at the delay in getting back to Sarah. It had to be done in degrees. He had to use hints of his love. Better to make use of suggestions of his existence to her than just show up and shock her. How on earth could he do this?

Casey received a memo from Beckman that they should once again try and civilise Sarah Walker. Perhaps a venture out in public under strict supervision? A beach excursion? With Navy SEALS to protect the public? And hypo guns to knock her out if she went berserk without having the restriction of an immediate mission to fulfill? Casey fumed. Why was it dumped in *his* lap? Over a week, he tapered off the drugs in Sarah. She grew increasingly agitated. He could hear the heavy bag taking a beating for hours a day. Her arms blurred on the Wing-chun punching dummy. She wore out another plywood shuriken target. Casey shook his head and liaised with the SEALS commanding officer. They wrote back and protested, because after all they weren‚Äôt psychiatric nurses. This was like United Nations peace-keeping, trying to keep warring factions apart. The public, or espionage enemies of Sarah‚Äôs, being kept away from her when all she wanted to do was engage and kill her enemies. Orders were orders.

His men were having problems with women. It was a very public beach, so there were thousands of people there on a beautiful day. All of his men were in the peak of physical condition, but were strictly dedicated to the job at hand, guarding assassin Sarah Walker. They were distracted by bikini clad, sleek young teenage girls who felt a magnetic pull towards the Navy SEALS. Petty Officer, Second Class O‚ÄôBanion, looked down at Sarah Walker lying on a towel on the sand. She didn‚Äôt look all that dangerous to him. Physically fit for a woman in her forties, still really pretty, very short hair compared to the last time he had guarded her, nice figure, but dangerous? Naah. He gazed out at the ocean. It was a calm day, the surf was down. The ocean formed the horizon. He knew the ocean horizon was three miles away from where he was standing. Something wasn‚Äôt right. He had a sixth sense that the world was slightly askew. Beyond what he could see, past the line of sky and water, was something not quite right. Using binoculars, he gazed out to sea. Using his general coms, he advised his men to stay on the alert. They trusted his notions and depended on them. Those notions had saved them in the past. They were often the Chuck on a mission.

He saw the head of an animal swimming towards them. It disappeared and reappeared in the ocean swells. His binoculars picked up the profile of the head, feline with tall ears, swimming towards them. The SEALS put their hands on weapons hidden under towels and beach equipment. Sarah had drifted off to sleep under a sunshade. Her body was pale and slathered with sunblock. She was wearing a bikini of green fabric that fit her perfectly. O‚ÄôBanion and his men focussed on whatever this anomaly was in the melee of the beach. Little kids were running around. Pretty girls were playing beach volleyball. Mothers were tending babies. The SEALS ignored all but the animal. The world had gotten a little strange after the message on the jumbo Tron.

‚ÄúI am the Singularity. I am the Intersect. I am Chuck Bartowski. I am coming.‚Äù

Only a few people knew what that message actually meant. Dedicated reporters were still chasing down leads on it. O‚ÄôBanion had a hunch. The clue was the word Chuck. He knew Chuck was offline. They hadn‚Äôt been able to use him after the debacle in Iran. Everybody who read the message was spooked by it. The Chuck he had used for intel‚Ä¶was it the same Chuck that was coming? The little animal swam up to the beach and came out of the water. ¬†

To O‚ÄôBanion‚Äôs shock, and that of his men, it was a caracal. A South African wildcat. It sat on the shore and groomed itself. More than one weapon was trained on it, surreptitiously. In the area around Sarah Walker, the beach crowd was all focussed on the cat. It shook it‚Äôs head to knock the water out of its ears. There was a lull in the crowd noise. O‚ÄôBanion thought that the caracal was actually bigger than he thought one would be. He had a lot of questions about it. He had far more suspicions about it. The feline eyes focussed on the sleeping figure beside him. O‚ÄôBanion thumbed off the safety on his weapon. His men started to move in. The cat stretched, it‚Äôs long legs out in front of it.

Faster than his eyes could pick it up, it was suddenly right in front of O‚ÄôBanion. It‚Äôs eyes gazed deeply into his. It‚Äôs paw with razor sharp claws was touching his throat. His weapon was pointed away from it. He knew he couldn‚Äôt move fast enough to prevent it from doing whatever it had come for. Sarah stirred and mumbled, still vaguely unfocussed from Casey tapering off the drugs. The paw on his throat moved over to his gun and pushed on the safety. The cat relaxed. Using his free hand, O‚ÄôBanion instinctively waved down his men. He saw hands move to safeties. They trusted his instincts.

Moving to Sarah‚Äôs side, the cat sat down on its haunches.

Sarah was lying in the aisle of the dream cathedral. All around her were vases of midnight roses. The floor was soft with carpet. She was looking up at the frescoed ceiling where pink cherubs surrounded baby Jesus. The doors at the back of the sanctuary were wide open so the gifts could flow in, and out. Her peripheral vision picked up an animal movement. Was it Orion? No, her mother had taken Orion. She said he took a while to acclimatise to his new life, but he was okay now. She sat up and looked down the aisle. A cat? A big cat, but this was a place of peace and safety, so it was not a threat. A caracal? Was this another gift? The eyes of the caracal were the eyes of her dead husband. It exuded the invisible mist of the love of Chuck. That love was patient. That love was kind. That love didn‚Äôt envy or boast. It wasn‚Äôt proud. That love defined her husband. It‚Äôs absence had left a void in her. That love walked on four paws right towards her. She reached out her hands to it, to gather it in as she had gathered in her husband. She had collected him from obscurity. She had handled him. She had seduced him. She had lied to him. She had manipulated him. She had fallen in love with Chuck Bartowski and hadn‚Äôt known what to do about it. He was the safe harbour. He was home. He was her Chuck. And he was a cat? She woke up.

Reaching out, she gathered the ferocious animal into her arms. He purred like a house cat. Holding him out at arm‚Äôs length, she dreamily said;

‚ÄúChuck?‚Äù

Casey hadn‚Äôt spoken face to face with the general in a week, so he was glad to see her when her face showed up on a screen. She looked behind him at Sarah‚Äôs glass enclosure.

‚ÄúWhere the hell is Agent Walker?‚Äù she demanded.

‚ÄúYou told me to send her to the beach!‚Äù

‚ÄúI did no such thing!‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a memo right from your desk!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that damn Chuck A.I.! Who‚Äôs guarding her?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe SEALS. Same guys as last time.‚Äù

‚ÄúAAAAArgh! Bartowski drives me nuts! He can‚Äôt even spell protocol let alone follow one!‚Äù

‚ÄúWait! A van just pulled up in the parking lot. Okay, she‚Äôs back. But she‚Äôs got an animal with her? What the hell?‚Äù

Sarah walked in high heeled sandals and bikini down the stairs into the Castle. A large cat flowed behind her. A US Navy SEAL was accompanying her. He looked bemused. He approached Casey and shook his hand.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs all yours, Buddy. I‚Äôm telling you, the world is getting stranger every day. She called it Chuck. Like she knows it. That thing had to have swum a good four miles across open ocean, comes out of the water, moves faster than I could react and she wakes up and knows it? This is a bad science fiction movie, Buddy.‚Äù He looked around the Castle, never having been inside a CIA base before. Impressive.

Casey looked over at the cat. It looked back at him. Sarah was sitting in an office chair with her hand on her new pet. It was the size of a Doberman pinscher. A big one. Casey could feel the love. He hadn‚Äôt felt that since Chuck had bought the farm. Around Chuck and Sarah there had been a cloud, or an aura, that made everyone want to sit at their Thanksgiving table to eat. And that aura was back.",0,1746045358.0,chuck,0,0.38,False

I (27f) have a boyfriend (28m) who I‚Äôve been dating for a year. We split the cost of nearly everything. He won‚Äôt even buy my coffee without me asking. He‚Äôs extremely frugal, to the point where he only buys certain vegetables based on the sale price, or splitting a cocktail. He nickel and dimes me for everything.

I am increasingly bothered by this. I think the moment that was a tipping point for me was when he wanted us to split the cost of a Plan B when a condom broke during sex. And he even brought it up to me again the following morning. 

He says he wants to stay with me for the long term but I‚Äôm not sure. I think we make a good match other than how cheap he is. I make less than him (75k) he makes about 90k for work and probably 80k from day trading so maybe 150-170k in total. 

He says he wants to be with me long term (like marriage) but I just don‚Äôt know anymore.  I know he‚Äôll provide for kids well with his frugality but as a girlfriend I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm being cared for properly. I sometimes buy him gifts and treat him but he mostly just treats me on my birthday. 

He‚Äôs not sweeping me off my feet and I‚Äôm not even a materialistic person. I dress simply and don‚Äôt covet designer or luxury items. 


We have an international trip planned for August and I know I‚Äôll have to buy everything on my own. 

I think the thing that bothers me the most is that when I treat him he accepts, but whenever he pays for something he keeps a running tab in his mind. 

Also I want to go to medical school and he seems to be talking me out of it due to the length of training. He recently told me he‚Äôd stick with me if I did nursing, but not if I wanted to go to medical school. ",38,1746045328.0,relationship_advice,76,0.92,False

I like to kick off this time of year by making one of my favorite recipes for a night such as this: a spiced coffee-cocoa cake. A recipe I originally found in the mid-1990s in an used occult book. I‚Äôve been making it every year since.

Woven along with the magic I weave in the cake‚Äôs preparation is deep combinations of flavors and aromatics that enhance the sensory, ethereal, and ritual experience‚Ä¶ Eastern world ingredients like clove, nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon‚Ä¶ each freshly ground from whole. A ritual unto itself! And western world ingredients like Mexican vanilla beans extracted with locally distilled alcohol.

Roses and mushrooms from our garden.

1kbqk0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kbqk0l/can_finalpress_portable_french_press_coffee_maker/,Can FinalPress Portable French Press Coffee Maker Review Enhance Your Brewing Routine?,"The **FinalPress 195893306367 Original Coffee & Tea Maker** caught my attention as someone who is serious about coffee brewing. Testing it several times a day over a few weeks gave me a solid grasp of its functionality and quirks. It promises a lot, including hot, iced, and cold brew versatility, all in a sleek and portable design. Here's what stood out to me.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed was how compact and modern the unit looks. Made from durable 304 stainless steel, it feels robust yet lightweight, weighing only 3.87 ounces. I could toss it into my bag without worrying about dents or damage. Its collapsible design is genuinely pocket-friendly, making it ideal for on-the-go use. Whether I was at home, the office, or camping, the portability lived up to its promise. There's something about the minimalist yet functional design that appeals‚Äînot to mention it doesn‚Äôt warp, crack, or rust easily, even after frequent cleaning in my dishwasher.

**Ease of Use**

Being manually operated, the learning curve here was almost nonexistent. I‚Äôm not a fan of complicated setups, so the simplicity of adding ground coffee or loose leaf tea directly to the micro French press was a win for me. Stirring, waiting a couple of minutes, and then plunging worked seamlessly every time. There's no need for paper filters, pods, or extra gear‚Äîa refreshing change from traditional coffee makers. When I took this product on a weekend camping trip, it didn‚Äôt feel like I was sacrificing convenience for portability. 

**Performance and Flavor**

The patented plunger system deserves some applause. Stainless steel springs ensure smooth brewing and maximize flavor extraction, whether I was making hot, iced, or cold brew coffee. And let me tell you, the richness of the flavor surprised me, especially for something so compact. The plunger directly brews into the mug, eliminating any potential mess. I found that it consistently extracted just the right aroma, delivering caf√©-level coffee at a fraction of the cost and effort.

**Check [FinalPress 195893306367] price on Amazon.** 

**Advantages**

- Perfect for travel, office, or any setting thanks to its ultra-portable and collapsible design.
- Eliminates the need for frequent replacements like paper filters, pods, or capsules, saving both money and waste.
- A durable stainless steel build that resists rust and physical damage.
- Easy to clean and dishwasher safe, simplifying cleanup after each use.

**Disadvantages**

- The brewing process might not satisfy those who prefer automatic machines, as it requires manual steps.
- Smaller capacity might not suit larger households or those who crave multiple cups at once.
- Coffee residue occasionally escapes the filter if improperly positioned, requiring careful handling.

**Key Benefits**

What really sets this product apart is its versatility. Whether I was craving a steaming cup of hot coffee before work, a refreshing iced coffee in the afternoon, or experimenting with cold brew on lazy weekends, this French press had it covered. I also loved its hassle-free brewing steps‚Äîgreat for those of us who don't want to fuss around with pods or bulky machines.

**Competing Brands**

How does this coffee maker stack up against its competitors? Comparing it to the Aeropress and Bodum French Press, FinalPress edges ahead in portability but slightly lags in brewing size. The Aeropress might outrun it in speed for large batches, while Bodum offers more capacity for multiple servings. However, none rival the FinalPress in terms of compact design and mess-free portability. 

This product shines particularly for coffee enthusiasts who prioritize mobility and simplicity over higher capacity or electric options. I also found that the CNC-precise craftsmanship matches or exceeds the durability of pricier alternatives. 

**Value for Money**

For its solid craftsmanship and multifunctionality, this micro French press offers excellent *bang for the buck*. Other portable brewers might cost roughly the same but rarely offer the same level of durability, simplicity, and brewing quality. Its ability to brew multiple types of coffee or tea adds value compared to single-function options. It‚Äôs not just a coffee maker; it‚Äôs portable perfection.

I have been on a weight loss journey since I noticed I was bigger than my friends at 8 years old. I have been 5'3"" since I was 12 (I am currently 32), and for the majority of my teenage years, sat somewhere around \~140-145 lbs.

In college, I worked at a bakery and had terrible roommates, so at my heaviest, I was somewhere in the ballpark of \~160-165. I started working with a nutritionist (who told me I was her only client ""not allowed to eat carbs"" because of how slowly the weight came off -- not me traumatized by white bread) before my senior year and entered my final year of school at 156. Postgrad, I took off another bit of weight and sat between 142-148 from the time I was 22 until I was 27. 

I thought that was as good as it was going to get -- I have always been incredibly careful about what I was putting in my body, grew up in a home of ""three is a portion!"" and ""Well, your genes are just fighting an uphill battle!"" and while I love a snack and am generally a grazer, used a food diary every single day of every single year from 2013 - 2020. During that time, I worked out, on average, 5 days per week. (I won't tell the story of the time a doctor told me I should consider upping that to 6-7 days per week if I ""really wanted to see weight loss."") At first, this was treadmill running and 1-2 cycling classes per week, and eventually, I went to work for the company and was finding my soul, if you catch my drift, 5-6 days per week with a limited amount of cross-training. Nothing ever budged.

During the pandemic, I began cross-training 7 days per week out of boredom - incorporating boxing, running, strength training -- downloaded a tracking app in place of a food diary, and began closely watching my calorie intake -- typically, around 1200 a day, give or take. I dropped down to 135. I, frankly, never thought this was possible. I was in heaven. 

After a few years, given a few back injuries from overuse, I decided to give my body a little bit of a break (also, hi 30!) and gave lower-impact classes a shot, and began taking pilates (in addition to \~1-2 spin, \~1 boxing,, + tons of walking) twice or so per week and lost another 5 lbs. Never stopped tracking food, too, still at \~1200 calories. Elated! 

This brings us to last year --  I got engaged and reinforced the habits I already formed - continued tracking, continued walking, continued exercising -- probably closer to 5 days per week, as I also began a new in-office job that didn't permit working out as frequently. I discovered that protein shake/coffee hack and lost another \~5 lbs, and sat between 124-126 comfortably from about July until the end of January. I legitimately never thought this was possible, and I felt and looked amazing. 

**Present day:** since February, I've been averaging at about \~127-129 daily, haven't changed my workout habits considerably, and have been increasingly more and more scrutinizing about what I put in my body (not in a ""whole foods only"" kind of way, in a ""you don't need a snack at 3pm, make some tea"" kind of way).  There have been days I've consumed \~1000 calories out of frustration -- which is messed up, but I'm just trying to be as honest as I can! 

The weight will not budge. If calories in, calories out is truly the way to lose weight (as I've seen time and time again), why the hell isn't it working? I am SO careful with my meals, track and measure nearly everything I can, and even though I have a desk job, I'm still very active. Is it age? Have I been in a deficit for too long? What the hell should I do to kick start this back up and get back to my ""happier"" place? I understand that 3 lbs isn't a lot, but on a petite girl, e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g shows -- plus, I was working towards hitting 120, and am incredibly disappointed by this roadblock. I have had my thyroid tested in addition to a full gastro workup (a lot of family history of tummy troubles predicated the colo/endoscopy -- not being dramatic), and all I have to show for it is a case of gastritis. 

I know I sound insane - 3 lbs is not a big deal - but I feel my progress slipping away, I'm constantly feeling inflamed and uncomfortable, and I want to get back to a place I'm confident about. Any advice would be really helpful. Thank you! ",1,1746044981.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

Think you're working 8 hours? Don't kid yourself. You're losing a whopping 6+ hours each week to distractions that turn your day into a time-sucking black hole. Picture this: notifications blowing up your phone, the colleague who just can't stop clicking that pen, and, oh, the endless parade of meetings about meetings. ü§Ø

**720 hours a year.** That's what distractions cost each of us. It's a direct shot to our mental health, making us stressed, error-prone, and overworked ‚Äî and it's draining $650 billion from U.S. businesses every year.

**Isn't it time to reclaim your day?** 

Here's the rebellion plan:  
‚úîÔ∏è **Silence the noise:** Activate those focus apps and turn off non-urgent pings. Feel the freedom as you actually concentrate for more than 10 minutes.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Safe havens for your brain:** Demand quiet zones in the office where Mark from IT isn't blaring his life story.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Reclaim your time:** Prioritize like a boss with daily task plans and cut down on that soul-draining multitasking.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Nix the meeting madness:** Push for async updates instead of time-wasting gatherings. Because no, we don't need 10 people to decide on coffee flavors.

1kbqggs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kbqggs,Witches‚Äô Night & Bealtaine Ritual,"Fire and magic tonight‚Ä¶ the night before Bealtaine signifies that the frost in our region is loosening its grip and we are transitioning from winter to summer. Tonight we mark that transition by listening and speaking between worlds‚Ä¶ past, present, future.. the threads overlap and reveal the worlds, tidings, and time as night opens up and we revel in fire and ritual. 

I like to kick off this time of year by making one of my favorite recipes for a night such as this: a spiced coffee-cocoa cake. A recipe I originally found in the mid-1990s in an used occult book. I‚Äôve been making it every year since.

Woven along with the magic I weave in the cake‚Äôs preparation is deep combinations of flavors and aromatics that enhance the sensory, ethereal, and ritual experience‚Ä¶ Eastern world ingredients like clove, nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon‚Ä¶ each freshly ground from whole. A ritual unto itself! And western world ingredients like Mexican vanilla beans extracted with locally distilled alcohol. Hazel nuts from Ireland, Costa Rican coffee and Venezuelan cocoa ‚Äúbeans‚Äù all freshly ground for this cake. Flour from Canada. Cobanero Mayan chilis from Guatemala. Roses and mushrooms from our garden. 

You get the idea. I‚Äôm not sharing this to say, ‚Äúhow cool am I?‚Äù, but because every time I make it, the process/experience is a direct reminder to be grateful for the incredible worldly access we have to botanical magic from around the world. To not take any of these special botanicals for granted, as well as the dynamic forces that weave all sounds as one, as many.

With my staff, a special treat for spirit work, galdr and some magical weaving, I‚Äôll embrace both fire and night as the worlds spiral forward into the next season.

1kbqez5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vancouver4Friends/comments/1kbqez5/the_hopefuls_and_the_cynics/,The Hopefuls and the Cynics,"I‚Äôm a new user here in Reddit with a simple desire to make new friends within Metro Vancouver area.

As an introvert myself, it‚Äôs tougher to reach out when you‚Äôre in a mega city such as Vancouver. And I‚Äôm glad that I‚Äôve met some interesting kind folks even before I started this.

What encouraged me to use Reddit is when I‚Äôve  successfully met someone from Eastern Europe, South Korea and Japan. The joy that I felt I thought must be shared with those who are seeking the same thing‚Äî fostering genuine relationships.

When I posted my initial public invitation on several groups, I‚Äôve come across many kind remarks for the effort, but I‚Äôve also received some very negative comments like I‚Äôm a scam. I mean, I know people these days could be sketchy and what not, but little did I know that such an innocent post with good intentions could mean that way to others.

But I guess, offering free coffee these days make some people think it‚Äôs a form of a product promotion with an agenda.

I‚Äôm spending my own money, investing time and effort. Because I believe there are many people out there searching, and seeking genuine friendships within Vancouver but just feels too isolated or feeling uncertain to reach out, and just waiting for someone to start things off.

We‚Äôre all loaded with stuff these days, and we tend to forget that Time is fleeting you know.

May you find genuine friends and develop healthy and lasting relationships!

Chuck had to admit, that as emasculating as it might be, he had no defence against Sarah‚Äôs will. She had only to put her hands on her hips and look at him with her big blue eyes to get him to do whatever she wanted. So, for Chuck to discover that he actually had one up on his assassin wife was a cause for deeply personal celebration. He was leaning over a sink full of dirty dishes one night and grinning like a Cheshire cat. He sang away to himself;

‚ÄúSecret agent man! Secret agent man! They‚Äôve given me a program and they‚Äôve doubled-up my game!‚Äù Sarah wandered into the kitchen with a half full wine glass in her hand.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty happy. Anything I don‚Äôt know about?‚Äù she asked him.

‚ÄúSo many secrets up my sleeves! And you can‚Äôt have any of them! Aha!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat makes you think I want them?‚Äù

‚ÄúCoz you can‚Äôt stand it if I have a secret.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you have taken advantage of that to manipulate me far too often.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh please, should we talk about your insecurities?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any, but would you like some?‚Äù She handed him her empty glass to wash. She gave him the eye and walked out of the kitchen. Minutes later she walked back in;

‚ÄúTell me! Tell me! Tell me! I hate secrets! They‚Äôre as bad as surprises!‚Äù Screwing up her face, she blew out her cheeks, then crossed her eyes and stuck out her tongue at him. ‚ÄúThose Intercept upgrades haven‚Äôt given you any more power over me, y‚Äôknow.‚Äù She stood in front of him, crossed her legs and looked up at him winsomely. Chuck finished the dishes and wiped his hands on a dish towel.

‚ÄúI just heard Beckman‚Äôs call sign on your phone. I wonder what that‚Äôs about?‚Äù

Beckman‚Äôs face looked grim as she gazed out from his laptop.

‚ÄúGood to see the two of you. Enjoying the software upgrades to your husband, Agent Walker?‚Äù

Sarah blushed crimson. ‚ÄúUh, um‚Ä¶yes Ma‚Äôam. I uh, well that is, I uh‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúEllie Bartowski‚Äôs work is sanctioned by us. So far, only her brother here seems to be able to tolerate the Intersect in his brain. All other tests in that regard have failed. Inadvertently Sarah, you were one of them. So, Carmichael Industries has been contracted by us to provide cyber security to the US government. No intrusions into our systems have occurred since then. Bravo, Chuck, good work!‚Äù

‚ÄúGlad to be of service, Ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd your battles don‚Äôt require any small arms, Chuck. I would remind you that your monitoring is ongoing apart from, at your request, your bedroom and bathroom. So, your wife has been seen having trouble walking between those rooms, first thing in the morning. We conclude that the software upgrades have had the required effect?‚Äù Beckman‚Äôs face showed amusement. Both Bartowskis were blushing. It was easy to forget all the surveillance they were under. Sarah picked up a magazine and fanned herself with it. ‚ÄúSo, both of you are of huge importance to the government. Sarah, your skills at espionage and solving problems in foreign locations ranks you close to the top of all our agents in the CIA. But, and I must emphasise this, training is continual. And since we cannot sit back on our laurels and still stay effective, I sent into the Buy More, two of the top graduates from the cyber espionage course. These two young women were told to liaise with Chuck Bartowski and are to be basically, apprenticed to him for the next two weeks. You, Mrs. Bartowski, threw them both out of the store! Your reputation in the agency also terrified them. And you owe one of them a new bra to be bought at your own expense. See the details in your e-mail. To ensure this never happens again, a rather lovely teachable moment has popped up. The Canadians have requested an American representative for a mission in their far north. Apparently, the Russians have sent some spec-ops into the Canadian space up there and they are going to hunt them down. They would like to present a NORAD united front, and desire someone with combat experience. We Americans regard the Canadians as such nice, friendly people‚Ä¶but I‚Äôve worked with them before and know better. You will leave in two weeks and your cardio had better be superb. In two weeks, when your jealous ass is out of range, I will resend the cyber grads back to your husband. They will have full knowledge of the Intersect upgrades and Ellie Bartowski, just this morning, informed me that she has a new one based upon acupressure points and martial arts pressure point fighting. Chuck will receive that just after you leave on your new assignment. Who knows how that will interface with the other two upgrades? And of course, those very fit, young and attractive women who will be working closely with him are fully aware of these developments. So, as you snowshoe through the tundra, consider the discipline you are under, Mrs. Bartowski. The Canadians are waiting.‚Äù

Sarah‚Äôs eyes narrowed. Two nubile young women were going to be leaning over Chuck‚Äôs shoulders while she had to leave California and go into the arctic? Her face was enraged. Chuck picked up the signals. He gripped his wedding ring.

‚ÄúNow Honey, I‚Äôm sure this will all just be professional‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to me! If I so much as *suspect* anything going on in Castle while I‚Äôm gone, I‚Äôll be a widow five minutes after I get home. Capiche?‚Äù She went over to the treadmill and was sprinting at top speed in five minutes.

One of the most prevalent memories of the Canadian mission was, for Sarah, sled dogs. She had never seen dogs who were so in tune with their masters. Ten dogs per sled, ten sleds with two men attending each sled, and she was the only female. The dogs lay down and looked back at the military mushers for their next commands. Dressed in arctic whites, the men spoke in French and English, praised the animals and continually scanned the barren, rolling landscape for their enemy. Sarah skied along beside the sleds, in continual hidden pain from the unaccustomed exercise. She couldn‚Äôt absorb enough calories to replace what she burned off. Only once did she betray herself, when her calves cramped up as she tried to pee in the snow. She braced herself against a rock as she stood up and almost screamed in pain. Cross country skiing had been invented by the Marquis de Sade and Nazi Gestapo, for the Spanish Inquisition to use on heretics, she was sure of it. Her fellow warriors were quiet and confident and quite lightly armed with NATO standard small arms and one mortar. The temperature hovered around the minus thirties Celsius with a stiff wind. Her French Canadian immediate companions watched her carefully for signs of frost bite as they moved across country. She had been assigned to a single sled and was determined to put forward a good effort for her country. This was difficult due to her exhaustion.

As she slept lightly, moved almost continually and was subject to caloric deficiency, she was hazily unobservant when the sled dogs stopped and raised their noses into the freezing air and looked back at their masters. They had detected something on the wind. The sleds were all spread out across a small plain and the target was up a rugged escarpment. One of the men she was with suddenly got flattened by a gunshot. She dove behind the sled with a C7 rifle in her hands, looking for the shot source. The downed man had taken the bullet in his vest. He was swearing a blue streak in two official languages as he searched through a monocular range finder. Two drones buzzed off from other soldiers as she searched in vain for the Russian spec-ops. She saw the mortar get set up and it spat three times.

Two of the mortar rounds missed but the third sprayed crimson snow into the air. The drones scanned for life and found none. Canadian soldiers jogged on foot with guns in hand, spread out as they approached the red snow. Over the coms, Sarah heard that three Russians had died, body bags were needed and pickup was to be in four hours. She hadn‚Äôt fired a single shot. Two Chinook helicopters took them back to a base. A Hercules transport took them back to the south and two days later she was home. Chuck had never been far from her mind.

Chapter 7

‚ÄúUuuuuuuuuh‚Ä¶‚Äù was all Chuck heard as he warmed the massage oil. Sarah had walked stark naked in front of the video surveillance over to the massage table and laid down within minutes of getting home. She groaned again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting too old for this. I‚Äôm an old lady. Oh gaaaawd! Stupid Canadians! They didn‚Äôt even get tired. Good thing they‚Äôre friendly. They have no mercy. Don‚Äôt take prisoners, Casey‚Äôd love them. Ow!Ow!Ow! Chuck! Go easy!‚Äù Her leg muscles were set like concrete. Cross country skiing with a full battle pack and weaponry that amounted to a hundred pounds, for full days, over two weeks in the field, had so over-stressed her body that Chuck gave up trying to massage her. He covered her in warmed blankets until the sweat dripped off her. This makeshift sauna got some of the lactic acid out of her muscles. They were soft enough to be massaged. It took two hours to do a thorough job. He carried her in his arms into the shower. She went straight from there to bed and never awoke for ten hours. He watched the video from the Castle to see her wake up. She was wearing a miniscule top and panties and looked into the camera with a grimace when she arose.

Chuck came home and cooked scrambled eggs, Canadian bacon, pan fries, coffee, buttered toast and a side of blueberries mixed with mandarin orange slices. Compared to the Canadian military MRE‚Äôs she‚Äôd been eating for two weeks, Sarah thought she had died and gone to heaven. She ate all that he put in front of her, then looked around for more. He put a plate of buttermilk pancakes in front of her with maple syrup. Gone! A bowl of granola‚Ä¶with more blueberries, gone! A raspberry smoothie with soya protein, gone! Her husband looked at her in wonder. She stretched out across the kitchen table and was back asleep in minutes.

Chuck covered her in a fleece blanket and went back to his two apprentices. As brilliant as they were, at the top of their class, they had immense problems following his innate cyber combat skills. He noted that both young women were armed with secreted blades. He was well guarded but noted that both of them were tense once they knew Sarah was back. They checked his home surveillance continually. One camera in his kitchen was on Sarah dozing on the kitchen table. It stayed on her.

Chuck warded off two attacks from foreign powers, responded with attacks of his own and was repelled in a battle of shifting digital tactics. As he adapted, so did his invisible enemies. He did pushups as a viral subroutine uploaded to a remote foreign server. He hung for minutes from a pullup bar and then slowly rose up to chin the bar, flashing with the Intersect at a cyber jab that was repelled by the security shell he had devised. Aaah, those Romanians! Leg lifts as the supercomputers hummed and cooled, dips with weights as the protocols were battered upon for ingress, shoulder shrugs as led‚Äôs flickered across memory boards, stripped down to a t-shirt and shorts to find a teenage hacker attempting a crude incursion from only two miles away in Burbank. He sent a drone to the kid‚Äôs window. Then he sent an e-mail to the kid. The young fellow smartly withdrew. Absorbed in his work, he barely noticed the pert young women who had to attend to themselves as the intellectual Chuck was presented through a superb physique.

Sarah hobbled into castle on canes. Her knees were swollen. Her ankles were tender. Her feet hurt. But the real pain was reserved for her hips. As much as she wanted to make mad passionate love to her husband, those hips were not going to sustain it. Lust blossomed but the body was unwilling. This all combined to put her in a foul mood. Just getting in and out of her black sports car had hurt. She had downed a few Naproxin already, so as they slowly took effect, she found she could discard the canes. Beckman smiled at her through a screen.

‚ÄúChuck tells me those two very pretty, and fit young women are shaping up nicely. So good to see. They tend to stick quite close to him as they learn his techniques. Hovering over his shoulders as he works away. I‚Äôve noted that they spend an unusual amount of time in the bathroom, but they‚Äôre young and prone to, y‚Äôknow‚Ä¶induced symptoms? Chuck has shaped up very well under your tutelage. I have no problems getting volunteers to monitor his security feed, mostly young women. I even saw your absences noted on a private calendar in a cubicle that belongs to an unnamed female agent. She wanted to know when you were out of town, on mission. I wonder why? It remains to be seen. The Canadians were quite impressed with you. They honestly thought you would have ended up riding on a dog sled. And they were from regular infantry units, let‚Äôs see, a couple of groups called the Van Doo‚Äôs, and the, get this, the Princess Patricia‚Äôs Canadian Light Infantry! Not even special forces! So those women who monitor your feeds are privy to Chuck‚Äôs file. Their conversations are fascinating. They have quite the imaginations as they fantasize about your husband. Their main reluctance to act upon their impulses comes from your reputation as a killer.‚Äù

‚ÄúGeneral Beckman, are you trying to make me jealous?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm just baring what is already true, Agent Walker. Watch your ass. Chuck has always been your Achilles heel. I know exactly what happened in Thailand and how you left all of your team behind. I know who Chuck is to you because I watched the whole thing develop. He fell head over heels for a pretty CIA agent who was so repressed that she didn‚Äôt know she was in love. You both wandered away from each other, with others, and came back. You lost your memory and reverted back into who you had been before you met him and he did the same. He was lost without you. Aimless. Depressed and pathetic. Useless to us. His love for you is what sustains him. He is still our asset. He gets more valuable every day. He gets more handsome as he works out. Your choice in exercise was superb, but then you knew that before you chose it for him. He can do it anywhere. He can do it almost continually. It was all for you, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs *my* husband. I may not remember all of our courtship, but all of the love I had to push down and ignore for so many years is focussed on him. I love him. And now, I know what to do about it. For a long time, I didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs mine. He isn‚Äôt *your* asset. He‚Äôs my Chuck. He‚Äôll always be my Chuck. A little island of goodness in a world of evil. No bloodthirsty Canadian or Russian spec-ops can keep me away from *my Chuck*.‚Äù She sat up straight. Glaring into the flat screen, her eyes cold as an amphibian‚Äôs, she flicked a fighting knife from somewhere on her body. It protruded flat black from her hand. ‚ÄúAnd let‚Äôs not forget, General Beckman, you gave him to me. He‚Äôs my asset! The one thing in my life that loves me back. He loves me. He wanted to marry me. He wanted to keep me when everybody else just threw me away. I‚Äôm a pretty face with skills to kill. Lots of guys want me just for the fun of having me, I guess. Chuck made me see a different life. And he‚Äôs such a shitty liar! If he wants to spare my feelings, he can‚Äôt do it. I see right through him. In our business we live off lies. And‚Ä¶he‚Ä¶can‚Äôt‚Ä¶lie! That makes him perfect.‚Äù Automatically, she opened and closed the knife. Click! Click! Click!

‚ÄúAnd yes, I did it for me. I made Chuck into who he is. I made him into a spy. I made him into a man. I took away the toys and gave him the tools he uses now. I don‚Äôt even know why I did all that. Perhaps because he was just so good. So innocent. So hurt. So damaged by Bryce and Jill. I‚Äôll never know why, not really, that‚Äôs all been erased. I‚Äôm sick of spying because I still have to lie to the one guy who never lies to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want out? Consider the ramifications of that.‚Äù Beckman‚Äôs voice held sympathy.

‚ÄúThen what do I do? I don‚Äôt have a degree. I have a PhD in advanced killing. Two hundred different ways. Oh, and the ones I made up myself because I‚Äôm gifted that way. What a gift! Killing people. Now do you see why I love Chuck? It‚Äôs just a game of comparisons.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always another way to make a living and to be frank, Chuck makes more than enough money for you to live on, both of you. Have you seen what we‚Äôre paying him? He‚Äôs priceless. Knock off the self-pity, Agent Walker. If you want to walk away, then walk away. I won‚Äôt stop you. Just remember how many people you‚Äôve killed and your fame in espionage circles. I know the Russians had a price on your head for a while. The Iranians would love to get you. Every middle eastern potentate wants to have you under interrogation. You can quit the spy game but you can never drop your guard. You seduced and killed the top MOSSAD agent. Vengeance was sworn against you for that. Walk away, but carry blades. Use the thirty foot rule. Keep your skills honed. And yes, I was trying to make you jealous. And it worked. I can see it despite the fact that your nerdy husband doesn‚Äôt even notice those salivating females I put in the castle to test him. They‚Äôre both walking estrogen generators. One of them almost touched him, but pulled back at the last second. If she had, Chuck would have turned her down flat. The cruelest thing you could do to him would be to die before he does. I‚Äôve seen men like him. One woman is all they can stomach in their entire lives. Jill was nothing and you‚Äôre everything. You say you‚Äôre better with Chuck? Well, he would lay down his life for you in a second. I‚Äôm glad you slowly came back to a semblance of who you were before the Intersect. We might have lost him if you hadn‚Äôt.‚Äù The general‚Äôs eyes looked teary for a moment. She blinked and frowned at such a display of weakness. ‚ÄúAnd yes, he isn‚Äôt hard to love. Not at all Agent Walker. Let me know what you decide.‚Äù She clicked off leaving Sarah alone and troubled. And in a pain that was, she thought, probably uniquely Canadian made.

Chapter 8

‚ÄòCarina Miller‚Äô was a handy alias. That was the name used on her hospital entrance papers for the shoulder-joint replacement surgery. Getting a bullet through her shoulder had made for a forced retirement for ‚ÄòCarina Miller‚Äô from the CIA. She was at a complete loss on what to do next. The adrenalin rush from her work was not easily replaced. Anything else she did would have been boring to the point of a yawn inside a yawn. She had a tenuous relationship with Sarah Walker, but wasn‚Äôt trusted around beloved men. She was surprised to get a call from Sarah. They met at a caf√© and sat under umbrellas, sipping coffees. Carina lived in Los Angeles quite a distance away from Sarah and Chuck. ¬†

Sarah was moving carefully, still suffering from the Canadian mission. Her decision to retire from the CIA had been joyfully accepted by her husband, but she still had reservations about it. Like Carina, Sarah was seeing her future as boring as hell. Carina listened for a while as Sarah laid out her concerns. Finally, she held up one hand to stop the deluge of worry from her.

‚ÄúY‚Äôknow what the problem is here? We both had personas derived from the CIA. They served their purpose for a time. We‚Äôre both alive and many of our cohorts are not. I am not as well known internationally as you are. My cover isn‚Äôt blown. I don‚Äôt have to dye my hair to travel. I‚Äôm also not married and I don‚Äôt know if I ever will be. I saw Chuck in your eyes before you did. You looked at him in ways that I knew, if they didn‚Äôt work out, were going to really damage you. Thankfully, he lost you and his love is so powerful a force that he drew you back in. And now, you can retire, but he is still a CIA asset and your husband, so you still have to protect him. Might as well have a baby, Sarah.‚Äù

Sarah‚Äôs eyes went wide.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready for that. How would I protect it, him, her, whatever?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh! Don‚Äôt worry about it. At least you have Chuck. I have nobody. I can walk into any nightclub and find a hook-up, but they don‚Äôt wanna stay with me. We have one fundamental problem, and that is that we can kill almost anybody. It gives us a unique perspective. I stay in shape for myself. I also have to do physio on my shoulder to keep that going. Wanna see my scar? Couple‚Äôa bullet holes too. Oh, and a knife slash that got stitched up in a back alley in Spain. So, I stay in shape for myself. We‚Äôre primarily killers. If we have babies, we are maternally inspired killers. Hmmm‚Ä¶he looks cute, that guy, and he‚Äôs looking‚Ä¶nuts! He‚Äôs got a wife and there she is, ring and all. All the good men are taken so I‚Äôll have to get a bad one.‚Äù

Sarah was amused. They were two gorgeous women sitting alone at a table in a caf√©. Many men looked their way. She was immune to them but Carina wasn‚Äôt. She had dressed for attention while Sarah had just pulled on jeans and a button down blouse. A man approached their table. He was darker in complexion and dressed impeccably, exuding success and status. Sarah looked directly into his eyes as he came up behind Carina. Holding up her hand, she pointed at her wedding ring. He stopped, looked disappointed and then nodded and walked away.

‚ÄúMarriage,‚Äù said Sarah, ‚ÄúCan be damned handy.‚Äù

Carina smiled.

‚ÄúI tried stealing Chuck. Didn‚Äôt work. So now,‚Äù she sighed, ‚ÄúI have to go and find one of my own. It has its advantages, marriage does. So, how‚Äôs your sex life? Bored yet? And‚Ä¶what‚Äôs this? You‚Äôre blushing? Sarah Walker, little miss seduction, is blushing? Soooo, tell me all about Chuck. Why are you so red all of a sudden? Getting a little warm, are you Sarah?‚Äù Her eyes mischievously danced over her coffee mug. Sarah couldn‚Äôt give a non-classified answer to her question. She tried not to blush, again, but failed and only turned redder beneath her foundation. Chuck had given her his daily treatment and she could still feel the effects. A wave of love for him swept over her causing her eyes to water. Carina took note of it and reached out to clasp her hand.

‚ÄúI apologise Sarah, that was too personal a question. But before you got married, it wouldn‚Äôt have been.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am totally in love with the most amazing guy. And yeah, I am so completely satisfied with him‚Ä¶Oh Carina, I adore my guy. I hope you find your Chuck too.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd rich. Fabulously rich. But ugly, I want an ugly husband that no other woman would be interested in. I‚Äôll just get a pretty pool boy on the side.‚Äù

‚ÄúBabies. A baby? Me? I guess I could. If my innards work. It would be fun to teach kids killing techniques. Hmmmm, babies huh!‚Äù

Carina smiled. She had planted an idea. She wasn‚Äôt sure about training children in lethal martial arts, but then Sarah was more dangerous in the field than Carina was. Sarah was at least happier than she had been when she arrived at the caf√©. They parted company, Sarah driving back to her apartment. She was thoughtful as she looked in her clothes closet. She took her birth control pills and stuffed them under her t-shirts in a drawer. It was decided. A family was to be started. She had a mission. And now, just one part had to be convinced. She put on a rather risqu√© sundress, high heeled sandals, fixed her makeup and hair and left to find her husband.

Entering the Buy More, she pivoted in one place, looking for him. No sign of him. She used her code to get into the Castle. And there he was with a younger woman hanging over his shoulder as he worked on a computer. Sarah instinctively went for a blade and the woman did the same. Chuck looked up;

‚ÄúOh hey, Babe! What‚Äôs up?‚Äù Sarah‚Äôs eyes were locked on those of her opponent. It was then that she remembered the words of General Beckman, and how Chuck was being guarded by the two young women as a CIA asset. She sheathed her knife.

‚ÄúJust thought I‚Äôd stop in, Honey. See how you were doing.‚Äù Chuck stood up and hugged her. She pulled him down to kiss him, hard and long. He ‚Äòhmmmmed‚Äô in surprise. Sarah grabbed the front of his shirt and pulled him down a hall to one of the bunkrooms and shut the door. Chuck thought that he might as well try out the acupressure subroutine in combination with the seduction/massage software, and see if the effects on Sarah would be any different. He flashed and started the experiment.

Two and a half hours later, Chuck was back at his work station. Half an hour after that, as his two female cohorts exchanged inquiring looks, Sarah managed to stagger down the hall. Her hair was a tangled mess. Her makeup was mostly gone. She was hitching up the sundress as she walked, and her expression was of sublime content. She kissed her beloved husband and sort of sleepwalked out of the Castle. When he got home, she had cooked up steaks and potatoes, glazed carrots and made a tossed salad. Red wine in crystal goblets, apple pie with ice cream for desert. Chuck sat down on his couch, and Sarah draped herself over his lap. She dozed off. It had been a really good day for her first day of retirement. Maybe, she mused, this retirement thing would work out after all.

Six weeks later, Sarah still wasn‚Äôt pregnant and Chuck was avoiding her. If she came into the Buy More, he would retreat to the stock room, hide in the Castle, or walk out to the Large More shopping center. He had gotten to the point where he didn‚Äôt care if he ever had sex again. As gorgeous as Sarah was, her drive for a baby was unsustainable to her husband. For some reason he had to take zinc pills every day. A doctor had checked him out and checked a sperm sample. He had passed with flying colours. And to Sarah‚Äôs immense disappointment, Chuck no longer flashed before conjugal relations. She was reduced to receiving non-Intersect-enhanced attention. Her frustration level led to some screaming confrontations with her husband, followed by apologetic conversations. Ellie and Captain Awesome were pulled into the problem, reluctantly, since they didn‚Äôt want to interfere in the marriage. Being located in Chicago by then, Ellie was relieved not to be near Sarah in her moods. Morgan, Jeff and Lester were more a hindrance than a help. Lester actually dropped a few one-liners on Sarah as she walked through the Buy More, trying in his own clumsy way to lighten her obvious bad mood.

‚ÄúY‚Äôknow Sarah, my nephew was caught playing with a dirty diaper right beside the AC unit. It was pretty disgusting.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess they do things like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt got worse when the shit hit the fan.‚Äù He grinned and dodged behind the Nerd-Herd desk. Sarah managed a small smile. Lester felt safe, being out of her reach.

‚ÄúDid you know that babies are born at womb temperature?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, ha-ha Lester.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually Sarah, I have a unique Canadian technique for creating babies, told to me from an old Indian legend by a white man in an Inuit village.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou do not. And don‚Äôt get me going on Canadians. They aren‚Äôt my favourite people right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt involves maple syrup, poutine and back bacon. Oh, and butter tarts. These are the staples of the Canadian diet. Oh, and Ukrainian perogies. With sour cream.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Canadian rye whisky?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. At your place tonight, after work. I‚Äôll text you the ingredients. On second thoughts, never mind, I‚Äôll just cook up all that and bring it over to your place. No customers in the store right now anyways. It‚Äôs mid-March and time for a feast!‚Äù He laughingly collected a few Buy More staff and disappeared into the kitchen appliance section. Sarah made her morose way back to her empty apartment. Chuck met her outside the door. He was grinning widely and holding a house deed in his hand.

‚ÄúSmile Babe! We‚Äôre moving into that house with the red door! It came up for sale a week ago and it‚Äôs ours!‚Äù She smiled at his joy. They settled in to discuss the purchase. Chuck made them Irish coffees to aid in the discussion. The Buy More staff showed up and crowded into the apartment with huge amounts of hot food. Lester had gone all out in his attempt to cheer up Sarah with culinary overkill. She chased down the perogies with Rye whisky and was wobbling on her feet by the time everybody left. Chuck lay out flat in the living room;

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never eat again! Oooooh‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI could‚Äôve used all that when I was killing myself in the Arctic.‚Äù Sarah sat down on the sofa heavily. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to have friends though. I‚Äôve never really had any. I guess Lester was trying to cheer us up.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh geez, maybe babies just aren‚Äôt in the cards for us Babe.‚Äù And as usual, Chuck had said the wrong thing. Sarah burst into tears. The baby was her new mission and she didn‚Äôt have anything else in mind. Chuck managed to flash at midnight, and the next few hours passed in cheering up his depressed wife. Three days later she woke up and was sick in the bathroom. Three days of this and she took a pregnancy test which came back positive. Lester considered patenting his pregnancy recipe.

The first ultrasound was a bit of a shocker. Sarah was pregnant with twins. She almost fainted at the news. Two babies? She didn‚Äôt even know how to take care of one baby. Prenatal classes were taught by a nurse who had never had as intense a mother as Sarah Bartowski. Trained to succeed or die, Sarah was unrelenting in her search for intel. What size were twins compared to normal babies? What kind of problems did twins present?¬† She frantically searched online for anything that would prepare her for the coming birth. Chuck was run off his feet by her demands. The Buy More staff had helped them move their apartment into the house (more perogies and rye whisky). Chuck had bolted together more baby furniture than he thought could ever exist. Finally, two months after her initial morning sickness, when she knew she was pregnant with twins, she was moved into her house, her baby room was painted, decorated and set up, her weaponry was safely stored within easy reach‚Ä¶Sarah sat down on the sofa and relaxed. Her eyes strayed to the entrance doorframe to her kitchen where she and Chuck had carved their names, in what felt like a lifetime ago. Sarah + Chuck.",0,1746044468.0,chuck,0,0.36,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Seattle Mariners and Los Angeles Angels, two teams that are as unpredictable as a cat on a hot tin roof. On one hand, you've got the Mariners, who are currently 16-12 and seem to have found their groove, much like a teenager discovering the wonders of caffeine. On the other hand, the Angels are sitting at 12-15, trying to keep their heads above water like a dog paddling in a kiddie pool.

Let's talk about the pitchers. Emerson Hancock for the Mariners has an ERA of 7.71, which is about as comforting as a lukewarm cup of coffee. Meanwhile, Tyler Anderson for the Angels boasts a 2.60 ERA, making him the pitching equivalent of a reliable old car that just won't quit.

Offensively, the Mariners are ranked 9th in MLB with 4.9 runs per game, while the Angels are ranked 25th with 3.7 runs per game. It's like comparing a gourmet burger to a sad, deflated sandwich. Cal Raleigh leads the Mariners with 10 home runs, while Mike Trout, who seems to have a permanent residency in the All-Star game, has seven homers for the Angels.

Now, let's get to the odds. The Mariners are favored with a moneyline price of around 1.75, while the Angels are the underdogs at about 2.22. Given the Mariners' track record of winning 58.8% of games when favored, it seems like a safe bet to back them. However, if you're feeling adventurous and want to root for the underdog, the Angels at 2.22 could be a fun gamble.

For my best bet, I'm going with the Mariners on the moneyline at 1.75. Sure, Hancock's ERA might be higher than a kite, but the Mariners' offense should be able to outscore the Angels' lackluster bats. Plus, it's always fun to root for the team with the better chance of winning, even if it's just to say, ""I told you so.""

The environment suits me and I like supporting local businesses. The problem I'm facing is that every cafe in the city, as far as I can tell, is absolutely freezing. I know I run cold, so I dress warmly, complete with jacket, hat, and fingerless gloves, and still end up shivering more often than not.

Can anyone recommend a cafe that's open at least until 5 p.m., offers decent coffee, and maintains a temperature above the 60s? (Higher would be nice. Low 80s is my unattainable pipe dream.) 

I'm looking for somewhere that doesn't open its sliding garage-door walls at every opportunity, that doesn't insist on keeping fans blowing year-round, and that doesn't crank the A/C as low as it'll go the moment the sun peeks out from behind a cloud. Somewhere oppressively hot. Somewhere that demands tank tops and shorts from anyone with a normal body temperature.

I just want to consume a stupid number of overpriced lattes without my fingers getting too stiff to type.

North PDX would be nice, but honestly, I'm willing to drive for this.

* Any neighborhoods you'd personally avoid (and why)?

* Budget is around $550‚Äì750k
* Prefer rowhomes/twin homes with some character
* Commute isn‚Äôt a huge issue (I work remotely)
* Hoping for a neighborhood with a good community vibe, parks, maybe walkable shops/coffee spots

1kbq4ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kbq4ns/how_to_take_apart_a_fan/,How to Take Apart a Fan,"Hello.

Welcome to another episode of Mechanical Mike.

As always, if you enjoy my videos, please like and subscribe. It really helps a lot, and once I hit another milestone I'll do another subscriber meet-up.

Today's episode is going to be a little different than normal, but, before we get to that, I want to pass along some personal news. As you probably know, Mrs Mechanical Mike and I have been having marital troubles, and we've actually decided to split up.

But it's OK. I'm OK.

I'll still see the kids every other weekend, and this way they won't have to see us fighting.

I just wanted to put that out there because I saw some speculation in the comments, and I really hate gossip, OK? I'd rather be honest with you guys.

Anywho, the second piece of personal news is that I lost my job. Yeah, the factory decided to pack up and move their operations to the U.S. Sucks, but what can you do, right?

So if you didn't like and subscribe already, please do so. Every click helps!

With that out of the way, let's get our hands dirty.

In the last few episodes we learned how vacuums work and we deconstructed a coffee machine. What we're doing today is a little different. We'll be taking apart an old fan.

And instead of doing that in my usual spot, my workshop, which I don't have access to since Mrs Mechanical Mike kicked me out, I'll be doing it on my kitchen table.

I hope you guys can see.

Tell me in the comments if you can't and we'll figure it out.

So, as always, the first thing we want to do is look at what the fan looks like all put together. Note what parts we see and where they are. Now, I don't have a diagram for this one, but that's half the fun, really digging around and figuring it out as we go.

I'm going to start by opening the body.

Sometimes there's a clean way to do that, but in this case we're going to have to brute force it a bit.

Basically what I'm going to do is take this saw and start along here, really elbow-greasing it until I get a nice, long groove, and then I'm going to take a crowbar *and really force it in there*‚Äîlike so, and then I'm going to press really freakin‚Äô hard until it comes apart *just like that.*

Boy, that is a real mess. But we'll clean up later. Right now we're going to see what makes this fan tick. Actually, let's play with the wires just a bit, connect them like so, and plug in to power‚Äî

Oh, wow!

It really does give you a new perspective to see it all exposed like that. A real anatomy. Here, let me wipe the camera and show you up close.

That's the heart, the lungs‚Ä¶
