I have been plugging away with all stock components this whole time. Espresso was good so why change. Good, not great except occasionally, 10% of the time. I follow some coffee and espresso enthusiasts on youtube so not totally ignorant of the espresso game and all the cool gadgets I could have. Anywho, out of pure curiosity I upgraded to some new baskets and puck screen, and holy moly WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!! Tried the IMS competition concave 18g, and I cannot get over how much better it is.  I somehow missed the memo on that. Yes, I know I‚Äôve heard something like ‚ÄúA better basket can improve quality‚Äù but Flair made it seem like theirs was top notch, so I didn‚Äôt know there were way better ones out there!

A little background on my weightloss journey I started at 178 and through changing my diet and upping my steps per day I was able to get myself down about 10-12 pounds give or take within about a three month period and maintained that for a good 8 months. That's when I decided to start Hers to help me continue to get to where I wanted to be. I'm in my late 20s and work in healthcare so there is no shortage of 'getting my steps in' daily which is helpful for my journey but when I find myself having time off it's just so hard to get myself to the gym. For exercise I enjoy things like walking my dog in the woods, kayaking, paddleboarding, swimming and rock climbing but these aren't exactly easy to do in a New England Winter. Hopefully this will help me get down to where I want to be and I will be able to continue to maintain it myself from there!

As for the first week on the meds, I've had a bout of fatigue that lasts a little while about an hour or so on the days I take the naltrexone/topiramate/B12 but I push through it at work as I have no choice. It's tolerable as I'm usually quite busy anyways and on my feet but I could do without it as most people could. I save my one cup of coffee a day for around this time and it helps somewhat. I've always been terrible with my water intake but since starting these meds there's no short supply of H20 in my system I'll tell you that! Thirsty thirsty THIRSTY but that's totally okay with me I need it. While on these meds I'm really focusing on watching what I eat again like I did the first time I was really determined to drop some weight so I've started using the My Net Diary app again, that tremendously helped me out the first time logging what I was putting in my body to really see some results. I worry about my protein intake as I don't want to lose muscle mass during this process so that app really helps me track how much protein I'm putting in my body daily on top of everything else and eases my anxiety. Since starting the meds I'm not snacking at all and having to find ways to force myself to take in more calories at some points in the day because I just get so full so fast, I attribute that to the placebo affect since it's been only a week but hey I'll take it! I'm excited to continue onwards, I haven't fallen below the 165 mark in years!

1iiakyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1iiakyt/podcast_hosting/,Podcast Hosting,"So, you‚Äôre considering diving into the world of podcasting? That‚Äôs awesome! Starting a podcast is like inviting friends over for coffee and deep conversations, except you just happen to have a microphone recording every word and a delightful audience itching to hear what you have to say. And let's face it, it‚Äôs way more fun chatting about your niche passion, whether that‚Äôs knitting for cats or exploring obscure 90s music, than discussing the weather. Who needs that?

First off, let‚Äôs talk about picking your niche. Think of it as poking around in your attic‚Äîwhat gems do you have hidden away that you could turn into engaging content? Whether it‚Äôs your obsession with survival tactics in fictional universes or a deep dive into the science of baking the perfect loaf of sourdough, choose something that lights a fire in you. You want your passion to shine through, and trust me, when you‚Äôre excited about what you‚Äôre sharing, people can feel that.

Now, let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room: monetization. Ah yes, the age-old question that every aspiring podcaster ponders while staring at their glowing microphone at 2 a.m. There are a few solid strategies here. First up, ads and sponsorships. You could partner with brands aligned with your niche‚Äîimagine being able to seamlessly weave in a mention of a cool new podcast-related gadget while discussing your latest episode! And don't forget, it's not all about the big companies; sometimes local businesses are eager for exposure and would jump at the chance to sponsor a segment.

Another option is affiliate marketing. If you‚Äôre talking about products you genuinely love, why not share a link that earns you a little cash whenever someone buys through it? It‚Äôs like recommending your favorite pizza place to a friend, but this time, if they order, you get a slice of the pie!

Now, let‚Äôs get practical‚Äîwhat about the tools? Thankfully, the online world has a treasure trove of free resources that would make any aspiring producer feel like a kid in a candy store. For editing, software like Audacity or GarageBand is your best buddy. They might not be as fancy as some of the high-end options, but they‚Äôll get the job done without draining your bank account. And for hosting, platforms like Anchor or Podbean offer free tiers that help you get your content out there. You can even monetize with them, which is like finding a bonus donut in the box when you thought it was empty!

Lastly, the sweetest part of this whole journey is the community you‚Äôll build. Podcasting is about connecting with your listeners‚Äîcreating a shared space where they feel like they‚Äôre hanging out with friends. So don‚Äôt be shy; invite your audience to engage with you, share their thoughts, and yes, even send in ideas for future episodes. That connection is what gives your podcast the heart it needs to grow.

So go ahead‚Äîgrab that mic, unleash your creative spirit, and start podcasting about what makes you tick! It‚Äôs a journey filled with laughter, a sprinkle of awkward moments, and the joy of sharing your passions with the world. You never know who you might inspire along the way.",1,1738764116.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

She waits for me every morning,
with green eyes, sparkles so alive,
silent, serene, in the same place.
Your gaze envelops like a breeze,
Your absence makes time weigh heavy.

In the golden glow that touches the room,
in the smell of coffee that dances in the air,
she calls me, without saying a word,
like someone who will never leave me.

The dense and warm aroma mixes with the silence,
echoing the subtle touch of his gestures.
She held the cup with the same elegance
with which he waited, without haste, but with desire.

But is it a dream or an empty promise?
Will it be a mirage or a home to return to?
Still, I know she waits for me,
restless fingers, attentive eyes,
Counting the seconds until I arrive.

What do I have to do?,"This whole last year I‚Äôve worked on improving my appearance. Mostly going to the gym consistently. Growing out my hair and trying a new style. Shaving. Working on posture. 

I was never one to go out to bars. Always a bit of a homebody. But at age 26 I started having urges to be out and about more instead of staying in all day. So several months back I began going out with a friend and we frequent bars every weekend. Point is, the bars aren‚Äôt my natural/comfort zone. But I do enjoy a good night out anyway. 

My dating experience hasn‚Äôt gotten further than online dating. I‚Äôve had all kinds of experiences through OLD. Casual, serious, FWB, one night stands, and many rejections. What I‚Äôm trying to get to though is that I‚Äôve never once approached in person. I have experience being on a date/hooking up but not the stuff that comes before it.

I‚Äôm not much of a looker tbh but good enough that I do get attention. Something I‚Äôm not used to because I was always told I was an ugly man my whole life. So these positive experiences a bit of a shock to me, and I‚Äôm not used to it. 

Few weeks ago, near closing hour, a woman I matched with but never replied to my text saw me at a bar. I didn‚Äôt do anything about it, since I didn‚Äôt want to bother somebody who didn‚Äôt reply to my text. But she approached me and said hi. We talked a bit. But the convo died out after a few minutes. She gave me her number. And approached again to say bye. And that was that. 

Next day I see a cute girl across the bar and we make eye contact. Neither of us look away and we‚Äôre making intense eye contact for a good solid 10 seconds. No exaggeration. And she gives me a smirk and looks down‚Ä¶. I didn‚Äôt do anything about it.

I‚Äôve had experiences that the ones mentioned several times since going out. But have never pulled the trigger and gone for it. 

I don‚Äôt know it just seems‚Ä¶ difficult for me. I don‚Äôt know what to say, how to say, and such. 

Like how do you converse at the bar? At the louder ones I mean. It feels odd to have the usual ‚Äúwhat do you do for work‚Äù kind of conversation because it feels to formal for a bar settings near closing hour. It‚Äôs not like getting to know another person at a coffee shop. I also don‚Äôt know what to say.

This shit doesn‚Äôt come natural to me. I have ADHD, and OCD. I mention this because socializing and connecting doesn‚Äôt come natural to me. I suspect I may be slightly in the spectrum. Everything to me needs to be a formula. I cannot cook without a recipe. Like literally. I need a recipe to follow to the T, I will not naturally season my food based on my own intuition. 

Same for this situation, I need like‚Ä¶ a guide. To help me figure out how to converse with women at the bar. People say ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù and ‚Äúbe fun‚Äù. But don‚Äôt realize that to some of us there‚Äôs legit a mental block that stops us from‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.. being a natural person I suppose. 

I want advice in what should be said in such situations. What advice do you have for the massive geek who goes to bars surrounded with people who are nothing like him?

I recently got my hands on a fresh batch of A-Grade Arabica parchment beans from Coorg-Chikmagalur, roasted just a few days ago by my friend‚Äôs small-batch roastery. The aroma is insane.

If you‚Äôre into good coffee, I have:

Whole beans (for those who love grinding fresh)

Freshly ground (have grounded myself)

Chicory blend (for that classic South Indian filter coffee vibe)


This is a small batch, so if you want some, DM me and I'll send a parcel! Would love to share it with fellow coffee lovers. I would be bringing in more later too

Weve just last year nung napadalas pag tambay ko sa coffee shop nila. Mind you super bait nilang lahat na staff ng coffee na to, to the point na minsan whenever I dine in they gave me a discount since regular customer na nga nila ako. 

Fast forward to when I started to have a crush on him siguro mga ber months last year. Were mutuals on Ig kaya may communication kami. That time were both single and asking why parehas kaming di pa ulit nag cocommit. After ilang months nabanggit nya sakin na may nakakausap na siyang girl. My heart breaks a little when i found out but its okay, kasi ako lang naman yung may crush for him. Then november last year, he posted sa ig its official hes in a relationship na. So I stop messaging na din sa ig niya. I even stop visiting the coffee shop where he worked. Para mabilis maka move on! chos. 

But lately, 1stweek of january i found out na last week na niya at the end of the month. So I try to visit again sa shop to bid my farewell. Were I visited he told me its for real, changed career daw siya. He gave me his first and last high five kasi di naman din kami usually nag iinteract pag nasa store ako. Ngitian lang oks na. And thats our last meeting

Ayun parang I need to confess lang kasi wala akong mapag kwentuhan hahalol. Im happy for him and sa relationship nya. Pero minsan napapaisip din ako. Nvm!

Here's my list off the top of my head,"For reference I drink 2-4 sodas daily and have for a very, very long time. I constantly switch to new brands because I have a disorder called MCAS which causes me to lose tolerance to any food or drink (aside water and like salt) that I consume continually. It is a really shitty disorder I don't recommend it to anyone. My life is hell.

Anyway.  
  
Here's my list from recent memory (ones I have drank in the last year) and how I'd rate them:

**S Tier:**  
*Mexican Coke*  
 \- probably biased but just always makes me feel good I guess there's a reason it is on top everywhere  
*Mexicana Cola*  
 \- on the sweeter side but has a great cola kick to it I inhale this stuff not quite a standard flavor but man is it yummy  
*Death Valley Cola*  
 \- got the right spicy cola kick tastes great this is probably the best runner up standard cola in my mind

**A Tier:**  
*Cherry Coke*  
 \- sweet coke but HFCS knocks it down a peg would love a cane sugar version  
*Spiffy Cola*  
 \- nice spicy cola kick but flavor kinda doesn't last  
*Cock Cola*  
 \- similar to Spiffy cola maybe slightly better  
*Mexican Pepsi (glass bottle)*  
 \- About as good as pepsi can get just isn't as flavorful as Coke to me though a little more processed tasting  
*Dublin Vintage Cola*  
 \- Pretty good cola kick but kinda tastes flat after a while  
*El Capitan Cola*  
\- I think this is the Rocket Fizz brand? It's pretty good. The flavor kind of dies out a little too quick to be S tier but if they could make it last longer it might make the cut

**B Tier:**  
*RC Cola Cane Sugar (glass bottle)*  
 \- the better version, but honestly it's kind of a lacking flavor it has a cola kick but it   
 isn't all that pleasant or lasting   
*Vanilla Coke*  
 \- the weirdchamp coke also HFCS, it's not bad though definitely tastes unique  
*Americana Cherry Cola*  
 \- Sweet but an odd flavor for sure  
*Boylan's Cane Cola*  
 \- Knock off cheapened Mexican Coke just doesn't taste nearly as good there's less of a spicy cola kick to it, tastes flattened after not very long  
*Shasta Cola*  
 \- Nice unique flavor but HFCS bleh   
*Pig Iron Cola*  
 \- Pretty nice kick similar to Spiffy if I remember correctly but it isn't as good   
*Triple Cola*  
 \- Pretty high on the cola kick, pretty lacking on the sweet and pleasant, this is the cola for black coffee drinkers   
*King Kong Cola*  
 \- Not great, not bad, an odd flavor that isn't very pleasant to me  
*Regular Coke*  
\- HFCS really brings the standard colas down a lot IMO  
*Regular Pepsi*  
\- Same as above, also kind of chemical tasting  
Pepsi Throwback  
\- You'd think this would be better than Regular Pepsi and similar to the glass bottle kind, but it's not. It tastes chemically in the aluminum cans and is just not nearly as pleasant as the glass bottled ones. 

**C - probably wouldn't have again:**  
*Curiosity Cola*  
 \- weird medicine flavor why drink this?  
*Coke Zero/Pepsi Zero/Coke No sugar - all these variants*  
 \- tastes like chemicals the way this taste makes u unsurprised there's cancer warnings on things  
*Chernogalovka Cola*  
 \- tastes like nasty artificial sweetener with a side of club soda and is really strong was disappointed in this one  
*RC Cola*  
 \- Like the cane sugar version but just worse because of HFCS, also it kind of tastes caustic

I'll explain the background of what happened this morning. I got up, cat was sat on the coffee table when I got downstairs. I stroked her briefly and went to let the dog out and make a cup of tea. Later on, when I'd finished downstairs I went back upstairs with my tea and cat was sat on the bed. I said hello to the cat, and our dog got jealous and jumped in between us, knocking my tea of my hand which went everywhere. I told the dog to calm down somewhat angrily (I know I shouldn't have) and went to stroke the cat who promptly hissed at me and ran away.

In a world spun wild by rapid change, the allure of work-from-home jobs in 2024 is not merely a novelty; it‚Äôs a clarion call for a balanced life. Imagine waking up to the soft embrace of morning light, sipping coffee, and finding purpose in your day without the grueling grind of a 9-to-5. This is your moment to unlock flexibility‚Äîyour golden ticket to a life that breathes harmony.

Let‚Äôs dive deep. Picture this: a digital marketing specialist, weaving emotion into campaigns that reach hearts and ignite passions, all while tending to your loved ones. The click-clack of your keyboard is like a heartbeat, syncing you to a rhythm that blends family, freedom, and fulfillment. The age of the digital nomad is here, and you possess the power to be at the helm.

Consider graphic design, where your imagination doesn‚Äôt just land on a canvas; it dances across screens worldwide. Each vibrant design you create can captivate audiences, changing perceptions and sparking conversations. But there‚Äôs more‚Äîthe flexibility allows you to mold your schedule like clay, freeing you to explore, to learn, to grow. Your artistry becomes a conduit for connection in a fragmented world.

Then, there‚Äôs the realm of freelance writing. Every word you pen is an act of creation, a tiny rebellion against mediocrity. Articles, blog posts, novels‚Äîeach piece carries your spirit, your experience, your truth. This is more than a job; this is your mission to inspire, to educate, to resonate. With every paragraph, you weave stories that can heal hearts. And with your newfound freedom, you can take that family trip or finally explore the mountains that have called your name for too long.

Let‚Äôs not overlook virtual assistance. In this pivotal role, you become the backbone of a thriving business, a linchpin that holds dreams together. You manage schedules, organize chaos‚Äîthe work may seem behind the scenes, but it pulses with purpose. You have the privilege of learning from entrepreneurs and innovators, etching your own path amidst their journeys.

Then there‚Äôs e-commerce, a realm bursting with possibility. Imagine curating a selection of sought-after goods from your home, crafting an online shop that reflects your passions. The thrill of sales notifications is electric, and you can scale this venture while tending to your family‚Äôs needs. Each sale isn‚Äôt just a transaction; it‚Äôs a step toward your liberty, a manifestation of your ambition.

Consulting‚Äîoh, the power of expertise! You have life experiences that many seek, a wellspring of knowledge that can guide others in their journeys. From business growth to personal development, you can shape destinies while creating your schedule. Drifting away from the conventional, you can sculpt conversations that matter, soul-to-soul interactions that incite transformation.

But let‚Äôs anchor ourselves here in the present. There‚Äôs no waiting for the right moment‚Äîtoday is the day. The tools are at your fingertips: online courses, social media platforms, forums of support. Resilience and resourcefulness are your allies. Identify your skills, carve out your passion, and feel the thrill swell within you.

Dive into the nurturing waters of community too, for no journey is solitary. Engage with like-minded spirits who long for balance, who understand the cracks of weariness, and who cheer for every triumph. Let their stories embolden you, fortify your resolve.

Each job, each opportunity, isn‚Äôt just a paycheck. It is a step toward reclaiming your time and energy, redefining your narrative, and embracing the spiritual depth of a balanced existence. This is your awakening. Step forward with courage. The world awaits your brilliance, your spark, your transformation. Take action now. Unlock flexibility‚Äîgrab the keys today and stride boldly into the life you were meant to live!

1ii9wyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1ii9wyo/gallbladder_surgery_storyupdate/,Gallbladder Surgery Story/Update,"Gallbladder Story:
It all started around Thanksgiving I noticed I wasn‚Äôt able to finish all of my food which is unusual for me, anytime I ate any sort of fat I‚Äôd begin to feel nauseous/ sometimes even throw up. On and off diarrhea & constipation, yellow/oily stools to light brown fatty stools.. My husband and I went to Disney world around the beginning of December and I was drinking coffees and eating lots of French fries and not drinking enough water. I was sick for a small amount of time every day at Disney. When we get back home I noticed I would get full quickly eating most of anything. Egg sandwiches were one of my go-to‚Äôs, so when I couldn‚Äôt even finish half of it and started feeling sick I knew something was wrong. I went to my primary dr and was like ummm I can‚Äôt eat or drink anything. He said it might be a stomach bug from Disney and to wait it out. Well a few days later I don‚Äôt remember what I ate but it was something to land an actual gallbladder attack, I believe it was McDonald‚Äôs. I had a full pain in my right side, my neck and shoulders were hurting and strangely my hands feet and lips started becoming numb. I went to the ER because I felt like I was having a heart attack or a pulmonary embolism or something crazy. The ER did a CT and they found nothing, gave me meds and sent me home. I had another appointment with my Dr and explained that I wasn‚Äôt feeling normal and I‚Äôd been losing weight (20lbs) at the point of writing this (February 5th) because I didn‚Äôt know what to eat or what was triggering it‚Ä¶ went on to get multiple blood tests and such. All normal except my WBC was high and my platelets. Dr ordered an ultrasound- all clear. I had yet another appointment and he suggested we do something called a HIDA scan and it comes back at 33 % EF at the 1hr mark and he refers me to a surgeon. I start having doubts that it‚Äôs my gallbladder despite because after all it‚Äôs just borderline low.. so I decided to eat a sloppy Joe and drink some whole milk. Big mistake. I landed in the ER again the next day and they did more tests and found sludge in my gallbladder‚Ä¶ ER Dr says oh yeah your gallbladder needs to come out but it‚Äôs not gonna be today. So my PCP referred me to a really great surgeon with over 300 five star reviews and he said I was a textbook case of gallbladder problems. Female, had a baby 3 yrs ago, overweight etc.. he also told me that once a gallbladder starts to go bad, it won‚Äôt really stop & no I didn‚Äôt get much of a choice because it needed to come out‚Ä¶ two weeks til surgery. 

In the meantime it got to the point where I could only eat whole grain pastas, some mixed vegetables, mashed potatoes & baked potatoes.. nothing really over 5g of fat at a time. Even a premade cup of cilantro lime rice had set it off. Not eating would set it off. A week before surgery I can‚Äôt do anything for pain except Tylenol and baths and heating pad. The pain has started becoming unbearable and annoying. The more time went on and the more I was in pain the more I realized yup, it‚Äôs definitely gotta be my gallbladder. I had three Drs (pcp, ER doc, and Surgeon) telling me so. Looking back, I think I started having problems when I was pregnant with my daughter in 2021. I couldn‚Äôt eat anything but plain toast and some eggs/ egg sandwiches with mustard the entire pregnancy. Any bit of greasy/fried made me so sick. Even postpartum I noticed I couldn‚Äôt eat certain foods or sauces. Like chick fil a sauce always made me nauseous. Chocolate and peanut butter gave me severe reflux and heartburn, I‚Äôd throw up every time I‚Äôd have too much red meat (this was at the melting pot too so it‚Äôs not like I WANTED to throw it up) felt sick after eating any hot dogs or chips or anything and I never realized I subconsciously cut those things out because of how they made me feel. I switched my diet up this past summer and it made a little bit of a difference. Around Thanksgiving I let loose a little and here I am. Supposed to have surgery on the 31st of January & the surgeon himself had a stomach bug so I was rescheduled to Tuesday, February 4th. I just kind of tried to pull through to surgery. 

The Surgery- Post op Day 1 
My appointment for surgery was scheduled for noon & they were gonna start at 1. That morning we drop my daughter off at my mother in laws house & we drive to the surgery center. I go in and sign some paperwork and they put me in a separate waiting room for surgery instead of the main lobby. My husband sat with me until the nurse came and took me back. As soon as they brought me back I had to pee in a cup and do a pregnancy test just as a precaution & weigh myself. I was 174 lbs the day of surgery. Before all of these things started happening, I weighed in at about 195-200lbs. So I lost a little over 20lbs in about a month. Anyways, the pregnancy test was negative and they take me over to the pre-op area and I change into a gown & they give me some warm blankets as well as some Tylenol and gabapentin with a tiny sip of water. The nurse had a lot of questions for me as far as allergies, medicines that I‚Äôm taking, all of my symptoms and how it all started & how I was feeling that day, she asked if I ever get motion sickness stuff like that.. The pain in my side under my ribs, neck, and shoulder was worse than it has been, plus the couple days leading up to surgery I had the worst reflux ever. I couldn‚Äôt hardly keep anything down. I talked to the anesthesiologist and he was nervous to go through with the surgery because of the risk of me aspirating as I‚Äôd been throwing up that morning when I woke up with all the stomach acid/reflux. Then the surgeon came to talk and I explained to him I was in more pain than I‚Äôd been in. The surgeon and the anesthesiologist went to talk on the side of the room and said we can do it as long as I know the risks of aspirating. How reassuring. So, we continued and the nurse got my IV in, gave me a bunch of medicine (saline, stomach acid reducer, pain meds etc) and a patch that goes behind my ear for nausea. Once they did that another nurse put a hair cap and some socks on me & I was wheeled back to the OR. They put me on a separate table & lifted me to a slight angle for the reflux & they strapped my lap & arms down. It wasn‚Äôt bad, but I also I didn‚Äôt notice much of that stuff. They put a mask on me & the anesthesiologist said it was just oxygen and I could feel my eyes getting heavy. lol it wasn‚Äôt oxygen. Then I started tasting something weird through the mask, he put something in my IV and that‚Äôs all I remember. When I woke up I was asking everyone what my gallbladder looked like just kinda looking for validation I didn‚Äôt do this for nothing. The surgeon said that my gallbladder was 2-3x its normal size & packed full of sludge. They don‚Äôt know if there were stones or inflammation yet, I‚Äôll get the pathology report within 72 hours. I woke up in some pain but it wasn‚Äôt horrible. They have me a hydro & helped me change into my clothes. I wore sweat pants and a soft loose-ish shirt & a slip on pair of hey dudes. I‚Äôm glad I did, I wouldn‚Äôt have made it if I wore my normal leggings lol. So I get dressed and my husband is able to come back and check on me. I‚Äôm still sleepy so I keep falling in and out but thankfully they weren‚Äôt in a huge rush to get me out of there. They gave me some water & a nutrigrain bar. & had to use the bathroom. They wanted me to pee before I left. So after all that, once I felt settled enough, they wheeled me to the car where my husband was waiting and I got in. I don‚Äôt remember much about the car ride, it went pretty slow. I kept falling asleep and told my husband I just wanted to go home and nap. We got home around 4:30 & I ate my other nutrigrain bar & had some water and went to sleep. I woke up around 6-6:30pm and got pretty hungry so I ate some pasta noodles & drank some more water, decided to walk around the house a little bit. Sat on the couch watching tv for a while & decided I wanted to go back to bed. The pain started creeping back in too & I was able to take a hydro around like 9pm and I went to lay down. The anesthesia also lasted a lot longer than I thought because I was still loopy/dizzy. Not nauseous though. So yeah that‚Äôs the surgery day & day 1 as much as I can remember. 

Post op- Day 2
I woke up around 3:30am in pain & also had to pee, attempted to wake my husband up to get me a couple Tylenol. Yeah he didn‚Äôt get up. Lol So I managed to get myself out of bed to go get the Tylenol and a cold water. So far it‚Äôs feeling like I did a massive amount of crunches or sit ups but the pain is nowhere near how bad it was when I had my c-section. I know everyone handles things differently though I just have a slightly higher pain tolerance. Anyways, back to bed at about 4:30am. 
Woke up again at about 8am & needed to use the bathroom. I couldn‚Äôt sit up in the bed without needing some help from my husband. I took a hydro because the pain is much higher today, going to try to walk around some today, I haven‚Äôt noticed any gas pains so far though which is nice. Will keep editing my days here until I feel better. I haven‚Äôt had a BM yet but with the anesthesia and meds I heard it‚Äôs normal. Sending love to yall ‚ù§Ô∏è

1ii9uoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1ii9uoz/twenty_seven_years/,Twenty Seven Years,"That‚Äôs how long I‚Äôve held onto this crush.

Yesterday was my last full day in the town we grew up in as kids. I‚Äôd come to visit from the far north, a grueling 12 hour drive across rugged terrain and shifting weather. 

This trip was important for many reasons, but there was one reason I held in higher regard than others: talking to my long held crush.

As you can imagine, after twenty seven years, life took us in different directions. She was married now, couple of kids, a house and a car payment and everything else one could want from life.

‚ÄúStill‚Äù, I thought, ‚ÄúI will always be her friend.‚Äù

And last year I finally had the courage to reconnect and talk online. We spent the last year talking very casually through Instagram, idly chatting when we felt the desire to connect. It made my heart soar to have her share her life with me; I felt a spark of joy every time we spoke.

Yesterday was my last day visiting, it would be my last chance to speak with her in person. That old familiar feeling of inadequacy and shyness overwhelmed me, and I nearly decided to leave sleeping dogs lie, and leave her be. But, my heart rallied against my mind, and I felt a fear of missing out. A fear of losing a connection. 

I thought I wasn‚Äôt worth her time, that she wouldn‚Äôt care to see me. I had already made a decision for her without offering her the chance to make the call for herself. I was ready to simply leave her be and move on. 

My heart was not.

Yesterday morning, I sat with my feelings and came to the conclusion that I was being a selfish fool. I should reach out, be vulnerable, be willing to be hurt by being honest to what I wanted‚Ä¶ and I decided to reach out and ask her the question I‚Äôve longed to ask for nearly three decades: 

‚ÄúWould you like to get a coffee?‚Äù

Just a little catch up. Friends who haven‚Äôt seen each other in a while, nothing serious. 

She took a small moment to respond and my heart sank: had I made the wrong decision? Was my instinct wrong? 

But to my surprise, she responded: we can meet at this local shop, here‚Äôs my number, I‚Äôll meet you there.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it. She said yes. She gave me her number. 

I got ready, both elated and filled with an unimaginable dread. It‚Äôs the kind of feeling only a heartfelt crush can bring you.

I got to the shop a few minutes before, sitting outside, waiting and anticipating seeing her. I got myself as cleaned up as possible, I‚Äôm currently in the best shape of my life, made sure I looked as well put together as possible. People came and went, and I watched through sunglasses as folks went about their day, talking about current events, loved ones, plans for the day. Every moment seemed an eternity.

Suddenly my eye caught a familiar glimpse of someone I had known through the window of a car passing by. Butterflies swarmed my stomach immediately, my chest felt heavy and my spine felt electric: she was here.

I acted nonchalantly, looking at my phone, but slyly using my sunglasses to watch her movements, to see how her body language looked when she noticed it was me. She slowly walked up to me and I looked up from my phone, smiled at her, and said her name to her for the first time in over a quarter of a century.

I bought her drink and we talked. We talked about old memories, our lives up until now. We talked about what we remembered, what we didn‚Äôt. We went to the store for her to grab food for lunch after, she asked me to come along, I offered to hold her basket while she shopped, we talked more. 

We walked to her car, and said our goodbyes, how good it was to see you, etc, etc. 

She gave me a hug. She rested her head against my chest, I rested my head atop of hers, and for a moment, the world felt like it was just us together in that small, but caring embrace. The smell of her perfume, the warmth of her breath on me, the softness of sweater on my hand as I slowly caressed her arm. 

‚ÄúLet me know if you move back to town, and hopefully we can see each other again.‚Äù, she said, as she finally pulled away. 

She texted me later thanking me for the coffee and that it was good to see me. I told her I‚Äôd like to talk more going forward and she replied with a simple gesture that she agrees.

I have much to think about, but I do know this: I gotta move back here ASAP. ",2,1738761903.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1ii9tsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/EldenRingLoreTalk/comments/1ii9tsd/some_brief_thoughts_about_the_dung_eater_in_a/,Some brief thoughts about the Dung Eater in a post-DLC world,"‚Äì The Dung Eater is obviously connected to the Omen, and by extension to the Hornsent, but what intrigues me is the context of wraiths. Dung Eater and the Omen summon golden wraiths, which are considered a manifestation of the Fell Curse; the Curseblades summon a similar cluster of spirits, though these are considered protective spirits, according to the incantation gifted by the Hornsent Grandam.

These spirits remind me of Greek miasma, which refers to a living curse that would plague families and drive them to commit acts of violence, rippling through society like a plague. To the Hornsent, who relished in asceticism and even pain, I suppose violent spirits would be treated like protective family, granting them further means to strike down their enemies. But of course, the Omen don't appear to want this curse, and are all the more pitiful for this unceasing inclination for suffering.

Bringing it full circle, the Dung Eater saw the Fell Curse instead as a blessing, much like the Hornsent had, and that by cultivating it through continuous acts of defilement, he would achieve something similar to what the Hornsent dreamed of‚Äîa blessing of despair in retribution for Marika's betrayal.

‚Äì The Outer God lore in the DLC indicates that the defilement of sacred sites or beings distorts their divinity in some way, and either produces or reveals Outer Gods while transforming their followers in turn. (The Great Fires spawned both the Formless Mother and the God of Rot, creating the Bloodfiends and Kindred of Rot, respectively.) Similarly, the Dung Eater mutilates his victims in order to curse their soul that they might be reborn as Omen.

With enough victims, he can cultivate Seedbed Curses in order to gestate the Mending Rune of the Fell Curse within his own body. By instilling this rune into the Elden Ring‚Äîthe prevailing object of faith in the Lands Between‚Äîwhat would happen to all of Marika's followers...? Would they need to wait until death to be reborn as Omen? or would the defilement of the Elden Ring itself be likened to the corruption of a tutelary deity, invoking a sweeping transformation all at once?

...

That's all I got for now on the subject, but I feel like this NPC's connections to the worldbuilding naturally get overlooked, lol. There's probably also something to be said about his striking similarity to the Lamenter's lore, but I'll need more coffee before trying to crack that one.",4,1738761831.0,EldenRingLoreTalk,0,1.0,False

Yet with F1 style, I'm 11sec off target, on a track that's 1:30 long, that's like 12% off at best.
I don't understand it. If I push harder I spin out, either with controller or wheel, in vr helps going even closer to the kerb, but I'm still not even in +10% target time. The F1 Coffee Menu is the same, I can't even take over anyone, they're just too fast.

These headphones, with their active noise cancellation (ANC) and customizable features, are a fascinating mix of practicality and performance. However, as with any product, there are aspects I adore and some that left me wanting more.

**Sound Quality**

I‚Äôve spent countless hours with these headphones, streaming music, watching movies, and even attempting some karaoke (don‚Äôt judge). The 40mm drivers deliver an impressive balance of bass, treble, and mids. The bass is punchy, yet it doesn‚Äôt overshadow the clarity of the vocals or the fine details in orchestral music. Spatial Audio compatibility is a game-changer if you‚Äôre into Dolby Atmos or Tempest 3D AudioTech. Listening to live concert recordings felt like I was front-row center, minus the overpriced tickets. Still, audiophiles might find the sound profile slightly colored, especially with the JLab Signature preset.

[Check JLab JBuds Lux ANC price on Amazon here.](https://wirelessemporium.com/product-reviews/jlab-jbuds-lux-anc-review-hbjluxancsge20web-b0crmb9z84/)

**Fit & Comfort**

Comfort is a big deal for me, especially since I often wear headphones during long binge-watching sessions. The cloud foam cushioning and ergonomically designed earcups are a dream‚Äîsoft and snug without causing discomfort. My sister, who has a smaller head, tried them too, and while they fit her, they weren‚Äôt quite as secure. If you‚Äôre someone who moves around a lot, you might notice them slipping occasionally.

**Battery Life & Charging**

Battery life is where these headphones shine bright. With up to 70 hours on a full charge (and 40+ with ANC), I only found myself needing to charge them every few weeks, even with daily use. The USB-C charging is a blessing for fast top-ups. I once forgot to charge them overnight before a long trip, but a quick 15-minute charge gave me hours of playback. That‚Äôs convenience at its best.

**Connectivity**

Pairing these headphones with any device is seamless, thanks to Bluetooth Multipoint and Google Fast Pair. Switching between my laptop and phone was smooth, and the connection remained rock solid, even when I wandered two rooms away. The wireless sharing mode is a fun addition‚ÄîI tried it with a friend, and we listened to the same playlist during a coffee break.

**Noise Cancellation & Isolation**

The ANC is commendable but not perfect. It does a stellar job cutting out low-frequency noises like air conditioning hums or a whirring fan. However, sharp high-pitched sounds, like my cat‚Äôs sudden screeches, still seep through. The Be Aware mode is a thoughtful touch, especially when you need to keep an ear out for announcements or traffic sounds while commuting.

**Controls & Features**

The touch controls are intuitive, and with the JLab app, you can tailor the settings to your preferences. Whether it‚Äôs tweaking the ANC levels, adjusting the EQ, or choosing between the various presets like Bass Boost, it‚Äôs all straightforward. I do wish there were some physical buttons for critical functions because touch controls can be finicky in the cold when wearing gloves.

**Water Resistance**

These headphones are water-resistant, which is great for sweaty workouts or light rain. I took them to the gym, and even with a full-on sweat session, they held up without any issues. However, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend submerging them or exposing them to heavy downpours.

**Durability**

Durability-wise, they‚Äôve held up well so far. The faux leather material feels premium without being overly delicate. My cousin accidentally dropped them from a table, and they survived without a scratch‚Äîmajor points there.

**Pros**

* Stellar battery life with quick charging.
* Comfortable earcups for extended wear.
* Spatial Audio delivers an immersive listening experience.
* Seamless Bluetooth Multipoint for multiple devices.
* Durable build with water resistance for active use.

**Cons**

* ANC struggles slightly with high-frequency noises.
* Fit might not be secure for smaller heads during vigorous activity.
* No included hard case for protection.
* Touch controls can be tricky in certain conditions.
* Slightly colored sound profile may not suit audiophiles.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to the Sony WH-CH720N, the JLab JBuds Lux ANC stands out with its longer battery life and competitive pricing. However, Sony's ANC might edge out JLab in more chaotic environments. The Beats Studio Pro, while a household name, felt heavier and less comfortable during long sessions‚Äîplus, JLab‚Äôs price point is far more appealing. Soundcore Q45 offers similar audio quality but lacks the seamless usability and customization of the JLab app.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

While exact pricing varies, these headphones hit the sweet spot between quality and affordability. For the features you get‚Äîcustomizable sound, ANC, water resistance, and excellent battery life‚Äîthey punch above their weight. Sure, they aren‚Äôt perfect, but for most users, they‚Äôre a smart investment.

Whether I‚Äôm deep into my work, at the gym, or trying to ignore the neighbor‚Äôs barking dog, these earbuds have seen it all. They‚Äôre not flawless, but they certainly deliver on several fronts.

The sound quality was the first thing that caught my attention. As someone who switches between podcasts, classical music, and bass-heavy workout playlists, I found the audio performance to be consistently impressive. The bass is rich and punchy without being overpowering, the mid-range is clear, and the treble hits the right notes. Using the Bose app, I customized the EQ settings to my liking, which made the experience even better. For audiophiles or casual listeners alike, these earbuds won‚Äôt disappoint.

[Check Bose New QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/product-reviews/bose-888507-0100-noise-cancelling-earbuds-comprehensive-review/)

**Fit & Comfort**

The earbuds come with a Fit Kit that includes three pairs of ear tips and stability bands, ensuring a snug fit for most ears. I‚Äôve clocked hours wearing these without any discomfort, which is rare for me since many earbuds tend to irritate my ears after prolonged use. Even during my gym sessions, they stayed securely in place, thanks to the stability bands. If you‚Äôve tried other earbuds that constantly needed adjusting, you‚Äôll appreciate how well these stay put.

**Battery Life & Charging**

Battery life is another strong point. I managed to get around 8.5 hours of continuous playback on a single charge, which is impressive for earbuds with active noise cancellation (ANC). The charging case adds a couple of extra charges and uses a USB-C port, making the charging process faster and more efficient. The quick 20-minute charge for an additional two hours of playback saved me on more than one occasion.

**Connectivity**

Connecting the earbuds was almost too easy. With Bluetooth 5.3, the range is solid, and pairing them with multiple devices is a breeze. I regularly switch between my laptop and phone, and the multipoint connectivity made the process seamless. However, I did notice occasional hiccups where one earbud wouldn‚Äôt connect immediately. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but it can be mildly frustrating.

**Noise Cancellation & Isolation**

The ANC is simply phenomenal. I‚Äôve tested these earbuds on airplanes, in crowded coffee shops, and at home with the TV blaring in the background. They effectively mute the outside world, letting you focus entirely on your music or calls. The ambient noise ‚ÄúAwareness Mode‚Äù is handy when you need to stay alert, like during a run or while crossing the street. That said, the ANC struggles slightly with wind noise, which can be distracting during outdoor activities.

**Controls & Features**

The touch controls are intuitive and customizable via the Bose app. You can adjust volume, skip tracks, or toggle between ANC modes with simple taps. However, brushing against the earbuds accidentally triggers commands, which can be annoying. Voice assistant support works well, and I found myself using it more often than I expected.

**Water Resistance**

These earbuds have an IPX4 rating, which means they‚Äôre resistant to sweat and light rain. This makes them a good option for workouts or outdoor use, but you‚Äôll want to keep them away from heavy downpours or submersion in water.

**Durability**

The build quality feels premium. From the earbuds themselves to the compact, lightweight charging case, everything is designed to withstand daily wear and tear. I‚Äôve tossed them into my gym bag a few times, and they‚Äôve held up well so far.

**Pros**

* Exceptional sound quality with customizable EQ.
* Comfortable fit with multiple ear tip options.
* Long battery life with quick charging.
* Outstanding noise cancellation.
* Reliable Bluetooth connectivity with multipoint support.

**Cons**

* Occasional connectivity issues with one earbud.
* Wind noise can interfere with ANC performance.
* Touch controls are overly sensitive.
* Slightly bulky design for some users.
* Price point may be high for budget-conscious buyers.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to the Sony WF-1000XM5, the Bose QuietComfort earbuds excel in noise cancellation and comfort. However, Sony‚Äôs earbuds offer superior microphone quality for calls and a slightly sleeker design. Against the Apple AirPods Pro, the Bose model outshines in ANC and sound customization, though Apple‚Äôs ecosystem integration and ease of use with iOS devices remain unmatched. For gym-goers, Beats Fit Pro provides a snugger fit but lacks the same level of audio clarity and noise cancellation.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

While not the cheapest option on the market, the Bose New QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds justify their price with premium features and performance. If ANC and sound quality are your top priorities, these earbuds are worth the investment. However, if you‚Äôre looking for a more budget-friendly option, you might want to explore alternatives like the Jabra Elite 7 Pro.

Every feature on these earbuds feels intentional, from the customizable EQ to the stability bands. They‚Äôre not perfect, but they‚Äôre close, especially if you can snag them during a sale. Whether you‚Äôre working, commuting, or working out, they‚Äôre a reliable companion.

1ii9mm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ii9mm4/i_f21_reached_out_to_my_highschool_boyfriend_23m/,I (F21) reached out to my highschool boyfriend (23M) I almost had a baby with,"
Years ago, when I was in highschool, I dated an upperclassman and we just really hit it off. Completely attached at the hip for months, really intense right of the bat. As the months went on, I began to show signs of worsening mental health, and he did his absolute best to comfort me through it. That winter, I fell very ill and after I trip to the doctors, we found out I was pregnant. My ex is an extremely family oriented person as well as religious, and immediately asked me to marry him, saying he would get a job, drop out of his studies and do whatever was necessary to take care of us. 
Now, being not even 17 years old yet, I was absolutely terrified and wasn‚Äôt sure if that‚Äôs what I wanted for my life, or if I would ever be able to have a say in my life again. We decided to have an abortion at the suggestion of my doctor, who was positive I would not have made it to term due to my age and size. This stress combined with the horrors of pregnancy hormones took a sludge hammer to our relationship and we ended up breaking up (quite messily) around April of that year, with very little contact with each other in the years that followed. 
In the years that passed, I tried my absolute best to pick up my life and move on, and I would like to say that for the most part, I have been extremely successful. But almost like allergies, occasionally I am hit with the most overwhelming wave of grief, not over the baby, but over the friend I loved and lost in that relationship. The grief has driven me to extreme points, I‚Äôve been extremely suicidal and it has led me to therapy, which is nice but does little in terms of a real solution. However, as of last year, me and said ex attend the same university, and while over 60k students attend this school, I find myself looking for him everywhere, even though it‚Äôs been roughly 6 years now. 
I have spent hours of my life talking through these feelings with friends, family and professionals, to no end. The number one advice I get is ‚Äúif it‚Äôs really that bad, you should reach out to him.‚Äù To which my answer is always, ‚Äúand say what?‚Äù The truth is for a very long time I refused to let myself reach out as I felt that, if he was as hurt as I was, he wouldn‚Äôt want to see/hear from me and I don‚Äôt want to cause him any more pain than I already have, but the other day, I guess something snapped.
I resorted to the most basic form of communication I know, and added him on Snapchat. I don‚Äôt know why, I don‚Äôt know what gave me the confidence. But I did, not knowing if he even used the app anymore, but to my surprise, his name popped up on my phone with a message. 
We had this long conversation about everything that happened between us, I was honest and I told him that I really do think of him all the time, despite my best efforts. I apologized for reaching out and said I hope he‚Äôs getting everything he wanted out of life. He was very kind the entire time and said that he was very grateful to have known me, that I was one of the most important women in his life, and that he‚Äôs not mad at me for anything. This healed apart of myself, as I had believed this whole time that he did not care and did not think of me, and that if he did, he hated me, all things he confirmed were not true. 
I was extremely grateful to have this conversation with him and let him know that, asking if in the future, we could ever be friends and he said ‚Äúooooo I‚Äôd have to think about that one. Exes aren‚Äôt normally friends and even having you on my phone is a lot. I feel like I can text you and reach out and I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I told him I understood and that I would not bother him further should I be allowed to stay on his phone, and we both wished each other well. 
It‚Äôs been 3 weeks since this interaction and I wish I could say it made everything better, that I got the closure I needed and I can move on now, but it‚Äôs not true. I want to be in the same room as him, on purpose- I want to ask about his day and really listen when he talks about it. I want to know things about him and be known by him. These are all selfish wants but genuinely, it‚Äôs like my body hurts I want them so bad. 

recently brought this situation up to a good friend of mine, asking what he would do in the situation and he did his best to guide me through the feelings my ex might be having. I explained that I guess I would just like to see him? and he suggested I invite my ex to coffee, no expectations, just coffee. I almost cried when he suggested it, mostly because the thought of actually seeing him was overwhelming, and said I would think about it. Well I thought about it, and decided the worst he could say is no and am thinking about sending him a text (after valentines) about meeting up for coffee. I know a lot of you will ask why? What do I even want from this? And I wish I could tell you, but have you ever loved someone so much that your entire mind body and soul waits for them, even when you know they‚Äôre not coming back? I wish I could move on like most people will suggest, but this is one thing I don‚Äôt want to let go of; if I never try I‚Äôll never know and I‚Äôll always regret it, I‚Äôll always feel like this and I just can‚Äôt live like that anymore. 
So yeah, here I am at my big kid age, sobbing into my phone because I‚Äôm terrified of losing someone I‚Äôve already lost before.

Here you‚Äôll find endless pubs, brunch spots, and a park where half of Australia seems to gather in summer. Whether it‚Äôs cricket, picnics, or beers on Clapham Common, this place is real community vibes. Located in South West London, it's pretty easy / quick to commute in to Central London.

Balham - Just down the road from Clapham, but a bit more laid-back.¬†

Hackney - Bit more street, bit more artsy

Think vintage markets, quirky cafes, chic wine bars and a buzzing creative scene. Plus, you‚Äôre close to London Fields for sunny afternoons and Broadway Market for food and drinks. Bonus: It‚Äôs a great spot if you want to tell people you live 'East'...

Hammersmith - Ideal if you enjoy riverside vibes and a pretty easy commute.¬†

This spot is popular for its balance of greenery and urban life. Great for pub walks along the Thames and catching gigs at The Apollo, plus, it‚Äôs well-connected‚Äîperfect for work and play.

You‚Äôve got boutique shops, nice cafes, and the lovely Highbury Fields. Plus, being on the Victoria Line means you can zip around London in no time - easy if you want to nip off round the UK or abroad as it's a stones throw to Saint Pancras / Kings Cross.

Walthamstow - London‚Äôs up-and-coming gem.¬†

Known for its creative vibes and affordable(ish) rents, this spot is great if you're craving a bit of nature in the form of Walthamstow Wetlands. It's also got a great food and wine scene, without the chaos of central London.

My Mergress is from the old mold, which had better blade support compared to the current Progress razors available today. The old design ensured a more stable blade gap, leading to a smoother and more controlled shave. With the Mergress conversion, this razor features a machined stainless steel adjustment knob and a red adjustment dot, improving both aesthetics and functionality. This razor has been a staple in my collection for its precision and classic design.

Shoutout:

A huge thank you to Christopher Bianco for the awesome SOTD razor blade display!

Mail Call: The ""Copper Ore"" Shave Brush #9

I just received The ""Copper Ore"" Shave Brush #9 from The CaYuen Workshop, and it's already a favorite! It‚Äôs fitted with a 26MM G5C Synthetic Knot by AP Shave Co., which has quickly become my daily driver. The G5C knot is truly the best synthetic knot I own‚Äîit has the softness of real badger hair while maintaining the backbone and performance that synthetic brushes are known for. It's an incredibly well-balanced knot that offers a luxurious feel while still handling dense soaps effortlessly, all in a very affordable package.

Soap: Catie‚Äôs Bubbles Irish Coffee

This shave wouldn‚Äôt be complete without Catie‚Äôs Bubbles Irish Coffee. The scent is a sweet, freshly brewed coffee blended with Irish whiskey, giving off a rich and warming aroma that makes every shave feel indulgent. Catie‚Äôs Bubbles, founded by Chris Cullen, has been crafting high-quality, artisan shaving soaps with excellent performance and post-shave feel for years. This soap lathers up effortlessly, providing great cushion and slickness for a perfect shave.

1ii9idr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ii9idr/the_late_night_text/,The Late Night Text,"I was about to go to bed when my phone buzzed.

A text from Olivia.

‚ÄúHey, can you come over?‚Äù

I frowned. Olivia was out of town. I knew that for a fact because I had dropped her off at the airport two days ago. We even joked about how her flight would probably be delayed, but she texted me when she landed. She was with her parents. Three states away.

I typed back: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you in Chicago?‚Äù

Three dots appeared. Then they vanished.

A few seconds later, another message came through.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for you inside.‚Äù

I felt my body go cold.

I stared at the screen, my fingers tightening around my phone. Maybe she left a key with someone. Maybe she came home early and forgot to tell me.

But then why did that message feel wrong?

I hesitated before replying. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù

No answer.

The room around me suddenly felt too quiet, like the air itself was listening.

I stood up, grabbed my keys, and left.

The drive to Olivia‚Äôs apartment was a blur. The streets were nearly empty, just the occasional car passing by, headlights flashing like warnings. My mind raced through possibilities. A prank? A break-in?

Or something worse?

When I pulled up to her building, everything looked normal. Too normal. Her window was dark. The parking lot empty.

I climbed the stairs, every step echoing in the silence. When I reached her door, I hesitated.

Then, I knocked.

The sound barely carried down the hallway.

No answer.

I knocked again, harder this time. ‚ÄúOlivia?‚Äù

Nothing.

I tried the handle, expecting it to be locked.

It wasn‚Äôt.

The door swung open with a slow, aching creak.

The apartment was dark. Stale. Like no one had been inside for days.

I stepped in, my pulse hammering against my ribs. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Silence.

Then‚Äî

A soft creak from the bedroom.

I froze.

Something shifted in the darkness beyond the hallway. A floorboard settling. A breath.

I reached for the light switch and flicked it on. The living room looked exactly as Olivia had left it. A blanket draped over the couch. A half-full glass of water on the coffee table. A pile of unopened mail near the door.

But the air felt wrong. Thick. Heavy.

Like I wasn‚Äôt alone.

Another creak. The bedroom door was cracked open just an inch, a sliver of darkness pressing against the dim hallway light.

My feet moved before I could think. I reached for the doorknob.

Then‚Äî

My phone buzzed.

The sound made me jump. I fumbled to pull it out of my pocket, my fingers numb.

A new message.

From Olivia.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go inside.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. My mouth went dry.

I wasn‚Äôt breathing. I wasn‚Äôt moving.

But I felt it.

A presence.

Right behind me.

And then‚Äî

The bedroom door creaked open wider.

I nearly dropped my phone. My heart was hammering so hard I could hear it in my ears.

The bedroom door creaked open wider, the darkness inside shifting. I braced myself, body locked in place, every instinct screaming at me to run.

Then‚Äî

A familiar shape stepped out.

A dog.

Olivia‚Äôs golden retriever, Milo.

Relief hit me so fast I almost laughed. My legs went weak, and I leaned against the wall, exhaling sharply. ‚ÄúJesus, Milo. You scared the hell out of me.‚Äù

Milo blinked up at me, tail wagging slightly, but something about him seemed‚Ä¶ off. His fur was matted in places, like he hadn‚Äôt been brushed in days. His paws left faint smudges on the hardwood, tracks of something I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. His eyes, usually warm and full of life, seemed darker. Duller.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get out?‚Äù I muttered, kneeling to scratch behind his ears. He felt cold. Too cold.

I glanced around the apartment again. Everything looked the same, but that feeling‚Äîlike something was watching me‚Äîhadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had settled deeper, like it had wrapped itself around the walls.

Milo whined softly, pressing his nose against my leg.

I looked down at him. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your leash?‚Äù

He just stared at me.

The air in the apartment was too still, like the whole place was holding its breath. I swallowed, shaking off the lingering unease. Maybe Olivia‚Äôs text was just a bad joke. Maybe she had asked someone to check on Milo, and they forgot to lock up.

Still, something gnawed at me.

I pulled out my phone, rereading the message:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go inside.‚Äù

I hesitated, then typed back: ‚ÄúVery funny. Milo just scared me half to death.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. Then they vanished.

I frowned. Olivia always texted fast.

Milo let out a soft whimper. His ears flattened, eyes flicking toward the bedroom.

I followed his gaze. The door was still open, revealing nothing but thick, suffocating darkness inside.

I hadn‚Äôt turned the bedroom light off.

Had I?

Milo took a step back, pressing against my leg.

The air suddenly felt colder.

I swallowed hard and forced out a laugh. ‚ÄúAlright, bud. Let‚Äôs get you outside.‚Äù

I grabbed his leash from the hook by the door, clipping it onto his collar with shaking hands. The second I opened the front door, Milo bolted, nearly yanking me off my feet.

I barely managed to keep hold of the leash as he dragged me down the hallway, his nails clicking frantically against the tile. His whole body trembled like he couldn‚Äôt get away fast enough.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

I locked the apartment behind me and followed Milo down the stairs, that last message from Olivia burning in my mind.

If Milo was inside‚Ä¶ who opened the bedroom door?

Milo didn‚Äôt stop pulling until we were outside, paws scuffing against the pavement as he dragged me toward the nearest patch of grass. He was shaking, ears flattened, tail tucked so tightly between his legs that it barely moved.

I knelt beside him, running my hands over his fur. His breathing was fast, his chest rising and falling in sharp, panicked bursts.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, buddy,‚Äù I murmured, though I wasn‚Äôt sure if I believed it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alright.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt look up. He just stared at the apartment building, eyes locked on my window.

I followed his gaze.

The bedroom light was back on.

I sucked in a breath, pulse hammering in my throat. I hadn‚Äôt touched the switch before leaving. Hadn‚Äôt even stepped inside the room.

Slowly, I reached for my phone.

‚ÄúOlivia. This isn‚Äôt funny. Is someone in your apartment?‚Äù

The message delivered instantly. No typing bubble appeared.

Milo let out a low whimper, pressing against my leg. I felt his whole body tense as if he was waiting for something.

I swallowed hard and looked back up at the window.

The light flickered.

Once.

Then, again.

Like someone was standing inside. Moving.

My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúOlivia, answer me.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. My fingers clenched around the phone.

Then the reply came.

# ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs with you?‚Äù

The words sent a sharp chill through me. I looked around, my breath fogging in the night air.

I was alone.

I stared at the message, confusion twisting into something colder.

# ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

Nothing. No response.

The window light flickered once more. Then it went out.

The apartment was dark again.

Milo let out a low growl.

Something about the night felt heavier, like the air had thickened, pressing in around me. I gripped his leash tighter, my free hand curling into a fist to stop the tremor in my fingers.

I needed to leave. I needed to turn around and walk away, call Olivia, and tell her to get her locks changed the second she got home.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at that window.

Because the longer I looked‚Ä¶ the more I was sure‚Äî

Someone was still standing there. Watching.

Waiting.

Milo‚Äôs growl deepened, a low, rumbling warning that sent another chill up my spine. I wanted to look away from the window, to convince myself I was imagining things, but I couldn‚Äôt.

There was a shape in the darkness.

Not a reflection, not a shadow‚Äîsomething was standing inside Olivia‚Äôs apartment. It wasn‚Äôt moving, but I could feel it watching me.

I took a step back. Milo let out a sharp bark, yanking against the leash. The noise echoed down the quiet street, but nothing inside the apartment changed. The figure didn‚Äôt shift. Didn‚Äôt flinch. It just stood there.

My phone buzzed in my hand.

# ‚ÄúGet out of there.‚Äù

I barely had time to process the message before the light in her apartment flickered back on.

And the figure was gone.

My breath caught in my throat. My legs felt locked in place, every muscle screaming at me to move. I forced myself to look around‚Äîat the street, at the other buildings, at the empty parking lot. Everything else was completely normal.

Then my phone buzzed again.

# ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. Don‚Äôt go back inside.‚Äù

I swallowed hard and typed with shaky fingers.

# ‚ÄúWho is in your apartment?‚Äù

The reply came instantly.

# ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my apartment.‚Äù

The cold inside my chest spread like ice water through my veins.

Not hers? I stared at the screen, rereading the words over and over. My pulse hammered in my ears, drowning out everything else.

I turned to Milo, who was still tense, ears pinned back. His body trembled under my hand. He was scared. More scared than I‚Äôd ever seen him.

That should have been enough.

That should have sent me running.

But instead, I found myself stepping forward, gripping my keys so tightly they bit into my palm.

I needed to know.

I needed to see.

Because if that wasn‚Äôt Olivia‚Äôs apartment‚Ä¶

Then whose was it?

And why did it know my name?

My feet felt heavy as I stepped toward the apartment door. Every instinct screamed at me to turn around, to listen to Olivia, to listen to Milo‚Äîwho was now whining, pulling at his leash in the opposite direction.

But I couldn‚Äôt leave. Not yet.

I reached out, my fingers grazing the doorknob. Cold. Too cold. Like it had been sitting in ice. My stomach twisted, but I forced myself to turn it. The door swung open with a slow creak.

The apartment was exactly as I had left it.

Lights on. Couch slightly askew. The kitchen counter still had my half-drunk coffee from earlier. Nothing out of place.

But it felt wrong.

The air was thick, heavy, pressing down on me like a weight. And it smelled different‚Äîstale, like the air hadn‚Äôt moved in years. My own apartment had never smelled like this.

Milo refused to come inside. He planted his paws firmly at the threshold, leash stretched tight, eyes locked on something I couldn‚Äôt see.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúMilo, come on.‚Äù

He whined again, taking a step back.

I sighed, unhooking his leash. ‚ÄúFine. Stay out here.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt hesitate. He bolted down the hallway, tail tucked.

I stared after him, unease curling in my chest. Milo had never run from anything before.

The door shut behind me with a soft click.

The sound made my breath catch. I hadn‚Äôt touched it.

I turned slowly, heart hammering.

The living room was empty.

I forced myself to breathe, to move. My phone buzzed in my pocket, but I ignored it. Instead, I walked toward the hallway leading to my bedroom‚Äîstep by step, my legs stiff, my body resisting.

I reached my door. It was slightly open. Had it been like that before?

I pushed it fully open.

My bed was made. My dresser untouched. The only thing out of place was my closet door.

It was open. Just a crack.

And something was breathing inside.

Shallow, raspy, like the air was being pulled through teeth.

I froze.

The sound didn‚Äôt stop.

Didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt acknowledge me.

I reached for my phone, hands trembling, finally looking at the message Olivia had sent.

# ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go near the closet.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have time to react before the closet door creaked open another inch.

And something inside whispered*, ‚ÄúI told you not to come back.‚Äù*

The whisper curled through the air like smoke, seeping into my skin. My breath hitched, and I stepped back, my body screaming at me to run.

Then the closet door slammed open.

An icy gust shot through the room, knocking over a lamp and rattling the pictures on the wall. My phone slipped from my fingers, clattering to the floor. I tried to move, but something wrapped around my wrist‚Äîinvisible, cold, crushing.

I choked on a scream.

The pressure tightened, yanking me forward with a force that sent me stumbling toward the closet. My knees hit the ground hard. The room blurred around me as the grip spread, clawing up my arm, pressing into my skin like fingers of ice.

I struggled, kicking, twisting‚Äîbut there was nothing there. No hands. No body. Just a crushing, suffocating force that refused to let go.

Then, a voice‚Äîlow, guttural, right against my ear.

*""You let me in.""*

Pain lanced through my chest, cold and sharp, like something had reached inside me and gripped my ribs. My vision wavered. The walls around me flickered‚Äîmy bedroom, then darkness, then something else. A rotting hallway. A place that wasn't here.

No, no, no‚Äî

I thrashed, but the force only pulled harder. My body inched closer to the gaping darkness of the closet. The air inside it wasn‚Äôt just dark‚Äîit was wrong. It had depth, like an open mouth waiting to swallow me whole.

I was being dragged in.

A guttural snarl ripped through the air.

Milo.

He shot into the room, teeth bared, his growl deep and primal. He lunged, snapping at whatever had me.

The force let go.

I gasped as I collapsed backward, my body trembling. The air shifted‚Äîthe presence recoiling.

Milo barked, snapping at the darkness inside the closet. The second his teeth clicked shut, the closet door slammed shut on its own.

The room fell silent.

My hands were shaking as I crawled backward, gasping for breath. My wrist throbbed‚Äîwhen I looked down, dark bruises were already blooming, shaped like fingerprints.

Milo stood between me and the closet, still growling, his fur bristling.

I forced myself up, grabbed my phone, and ran.

I didn‚Äôt stop. Not when the lights flickered as I passed. Not when I heard something scraping against the walls. Not even when I felt the icy breath on the back of my neck as I reached the door.

I threw it open, nearly tripping over myself as I stumbled into the hallway.

Milo followed, and the door slammed shut behind us.

I stood there, panting, staring at the door. My apartment. My home.

And from inside, muffled but clear‚Äî

A whisper.

*‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over.‚Äù*

My hands were still shaking when I unlocked my phone. I barely registered the sweat slicking my fingers or the way my breath came in sharp, ragged gasps. All I knew was that I had to call for help.

I tapped 9-1-1.

The ringing felt like it stretched for hours before a voice finally clicked in.

""Nine-one-one, what‚Äôs your emergency?""

I swallowed hard. ""Please, you have to send someone. There‚Äôs‚Äîthere‚Äôs something in my apartment. It attacked me. It‚Äôs not human.""

A pause. Then, in the most patronizing voice I‚Äôd ever heard:

""Ma‚Äôam, are you in immediate danger?""

I looked at my wrist. The bruises were deepening, spreading up my forearm like ink soaking into paper. I licked my lips. ""Yes. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but it‚Äôs real. Please, just send someone!""

Another pause.

""Are you alone?""

I glanced down at Milo. His ears were still pinned back, his tail stiff. He hadn‚Äôt taken his eyes off the door.

""No,"" I said. ""My dog is with me.""

Another beat of silence. Then, with the kind of detached boredom that made my stomach drop, the dispatcher said, ""Ma‚Äôam, have you been drinking or taking any substances tonight?""

My stomach twisted.

""No! I told you, something attacked me! I have bruises‚Äî""

""Have you been experiencing any stress recently? Lack of sleep? Have you had any prior‚Äî""

I hung up.

I knew that tone. The same one people use when they think you‚Äôre crazy.

Milo whined, pressing his head into my leg. My breath hitched, and I ran a hand through my hair, trying to keep from shaking apart.

They didn‚Äôt believe me.

No one would believe me.

Then the pounding on my door sent Milo into a frenzy. His barking was sharp, frantic, but I barely heard it over the ringing in my ears. The laughter from my phone had stopped the moment the first knock hit.

""Police!"" a voice called. ""Open up!""

I hesitated.

For days, I had begged for someone to believe me. But now that they were here, dread coiled in my stomach.

I forced myself to my feet and opened the door.

Two officers stood there‚Äîa man and a woman, both watching me with careful, unreadable expressions. Behind them, my neighbor, Mrs. Calloway, peered out from her doorway, clutching her robe closed.

""Ma‚Äôam, we received multiple calls about screaming from this unit,"" the male officer said. His name tag read Officer Reynolds. His partner, Officer Vega, stood with her arms crossed, scanning the apartment.

I swallowed.

""I‚ÄîIt wasn‚Äôt me,"" I said, but my voice cracked.

Vega‚Äôs gaze landed on my bruised arms.

""Are you hurt?"" she asked.

I shook my head. ""It‚Äôs not‚ÄîIt‚Äôs not what you think.""

Reynolds sighed. ""Ma‚Äôam, can we step inside?""

I hesitated. If they came in, they‚Äôd feel it. The way the air in my apartment was wrong. The way the shadows clung to the corners like they were waiting.

But I stepped aside.

Vega‚Äôs eyes flickered to my living room. The mess of papers, the empty coffee cups, the scattered printouts on hauntings, possessions‚Äîproof that I was deep in something I couldn‚Äôt escape.

""You been sleeping much?"" Reynolds asked.

I clenched my jaw. ""I‚Äî""

Vega‚Äôs radio crackled.

""10-96,"" the dispatcher‚Äôs voice said.

My stomach dropped. 10-96.¬†

They weren‚Äôt here to help me.

They were here to take me in.

I took a step back, but Vega caught my arm. ""Ma‚Äôam, we‚Äôre going to have you come with us for a quick evaluation, okay?""

""No."" I pulled away. ""You don‚Äôt understand. There‚Äôs something here. It‚Äôs real. It‚Äî""

Reynolds pulled out handcuffs. ""Let‚Äôs not make this difficult.""

Milo growled.

The room tilted.

Something shifted behind me. I felt the air grow heavy, the unseen presence curling around my neck like fingers ready to squeeze.

I tried one last time. ""Please. You have to listen to me.""

Reynolds just sighed. ""Yeah. I‚Äôve heard that one before.""

The psych ward smelled like antiseptic and old air conditioning. The walls were white. Too white. Like a place built to scrub the mind clean.

They took my phone. My camera. My notes.

They gave me a gray jumpsuit and a stiff bed in a room with no sharp edges. The window didn‚Äôt open. The door had a small slot for food trays.

I sat on the bed, staring at my bruised arms, at the way the darkness still lingered under my skin like fingerprints.

Maybe they were right. Maybe I had lost it.

But then‚Äî

A creak.

The air shifted.

I turned slowly.

The chair in the corner moved an inch.

A whisper slid along the walls, curling into my ear.

*""I told you. I see you.""*

I wasn‚Äôt breathing. I wasn‚Äôt moving.

But I felt it.

A presence.

Right behind me.

And then‚Äî

The bedroom door creaked open wider.

I nearly dropped my phone. My heart was hammering so hard I could hear it in my ears.

The bedroom door creaked open wider, the darkness inside shifting. I braced myself, body locked in place, every instinct screaming at me to run.

Then‚Äî

A familiar shape stepped out.

A dog.

Olivia‚Äôs golden retriever, Milo.

Relief hit me so fast I almost laughed. My legs went weak, and I leaned against the wall, exhaling sharply. ‚ÄúJesus, Milo. You scared the hell out of me.‚Äù

Milo blinked up at me, tail wagging slightly, but something about him seemed‚Ä¶ off. His fur was matted in places, like he hadn‚Äôt been brushed in days. His paws left faint smudges on the hardwood, tracks of something I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. His eyes, usually warm and full of life, seemed darker. Duller.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get out?‚Äù I muttered, kneeling to scratch behind his ears. He felt cold. Too cold.

I glanced around the apartment again. Everything looked the same, but that feeling‚Äîlike something was watching me‚Äîhadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had settled deeper, like it had wrapped itself around the walls.

Milo whined softly, pressing his nose against my leg.

I looked down at him. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your leash?‚Äù

He just stared at me.

The air in the apartment was too still, like the whole place was holding its breath. I swallowed, shaking off the lingering unease. Maybe Olivia‚Äôs text was just a bad joke. Maybe she had asked someone to check on Milo, and they forgot to lock up.

Still, something gnawed at me.

I pulled out my phone, rereading the message:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go inside.‚Äù

I hesitated, then typed back: ‚ÄúVery funny. Milo just scared me half to death.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. Then they vanished.

I frowned. Olivia always texted fast.

Milo let out a soft whimper. His ears flattened, eyes flicking toward the bedroom.

I followed his gaze. The door was still open, revealing nothing but thick, suffocating darkness inside.

I hadn‚Äôt turned the bedroom light off.

Had I?

Milo took a step back, pressing against my leg.

The air suddenly felt colder.

I swallowed hard and forced out a laugh. ‚ÄúAlright, bud. Let‚Äôs get you outside.‚Äù

I grabbed his leash from the hook by the door, clipping it onto his collar with shaking hands. The second I opened the front door, Milo bolted, nearly yanking me off my feet.

I barely managed to keep hold of the leash as he dragged me down the hallway, his nails clicking frantically against the tile. His whole body trembled like he couldn‚Äôt get away fast enough.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

I locked the apartment behind me and followed Milo down the stairs, that last message from Olivia burning in my mind.

If Milo was inside‚Ä¶ who opened the bedroom door?

Milo didn‚Äôt stop pulling until we were outside, paws scuffing against the pavement as he dragged me toward the nearest patch of grass. He was shaking, ears flattened, tail tucked so tightly between his legs that it barely moved.

I knelt beside him, running my hands over his fur. His breathing was fast, his chest rising and falling in sharp, panicked bursts.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, buddy,‚Äù I murmured, though I wasn‚Äôt sure if I believed it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alright.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt look up. He just stared at the apartment building, eyes locked on my window.

I followed his gaze.

The bedroom light was back on.

I sucked in a breath, pulse hammering in my throat. I hadn‚Äôt touched the switch before leaving. Hadn‚Äôt even stepped inside the room.

Slowly, I reached for my phone.

‚ÄúOlivia. This isn‚Äôt funny. Is someone in your apartment?‚Äù

The message delivered instantly. No typing bubble appeared.

Milo let out a low whimper, pressing against my leg. I felt his whole body tense as if he was waiting for something.

I swallowed hard and looked back up at the window.

The light flickered.

Once.

Then, again.

Like someone was standing inside. Moving.

My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúOlivia, answer me.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. My fingers clenched around the phone.

Then the reply came.

# ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs with you?‚Äù

The words sent a sharp chill through me. I looked around, my breath fogging in the night air.

I was alone.

I stared at the message, confusion twisting into something colder.

# ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

Nothing. No response.

The window light flickered once more. Then it went out.

The apartment was dark again.

Milo let out a low growl.

Something about the night felt heavier, like the air had thickened, pressing in around me. I gripped his leash tighter, my free hand curling into a fist to stop the tremor in my fingers.

I needed to leave. I needed to turn around and walk away, call Olivia, and tell her to get her locks changed the second she got home.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at that window.

Because the longer I looked‚Ä¶ the more I was sure‚Äî

Someone was still standing there. Watching.

Waiting.

Milo‚Äôs growl deepened, a low, rumbling warning that sent another chill up my spine. I wanted to look away from the window, to convince myself I was imagining things, but I couldn‚Äôt.

There was a shape in the darkness.

Not a reflection, not a shadow‚Äîsomething was standing inside Olivia‚Äôs apartment. It wasn‚Äôt moving, but I could feel it watching me.

I took a step back. Milo let out a sharp bark, yanking against the leash. The noise echoed down the quiet street, but nothing inside the apartment changed. The figure didn‚Äôt shift. Didn‚Äôt flinch. It just stood there.

My phone buzzed in my hand.

# ‚ÄúGet out of there.‚Äù

I barely had time to process the message before the light in her apartment flickered back on.

And the figure was gone.

My breath caught in my throat. My legs felt locked in place, every muscle screaming at me to move. I forced myself to look around‚Äîat the street, at the other buildings, at the empty parking lot. Everything else was completely normal.

Then my phone buzzed again.

# ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. Don‚Äôt go back inside.‚Äù

I swallowed hard and typed with shaky fingers.

# ‚ÄúWho is in your apartment?‚Äù

The reply came instantly.

# ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my apartment.‚Äù

The cold inside my chest spread like ice water through my veins.

Not hers? I stared at the screen, rereading the words over and over. My pulse hammered in my ears, drowning out everything else.

I turned to Milo, who was still tense, ears pinned back. His body trembled under my hand. He was scared. More scared than I‚Äôd ever seen him.

That should have been enough.

That should have sent me running.

But instead, I found myself stepping forward, gripping my keys so tightly they bit into my palm.

I needed to know.

I needed to see.

Because if that wasn‚Äôt Olivia‚Äôs apartment‚Ä¶

Then whose was it?

And why did it know my name?

My feet felt heavy as I stepped toward the apartment door. Every instinct screamed at me to turn around, to listen to Olivia, to listen to Milo‚Äîwho was now whining, pulling at his leash in the opposite direction.

But I couldn‚Äôt leave. Not yet.

I reached out, my fingers grazing the doorknob. Cold. Too cold. Like it had been sitting in ice. My stomach twisted, but I forced myself to turn it. The door swung open with a slow creak.

The apartment was exactly as I had left it.

Lights on. Couch slightly askew. The kitchen counter still had my half-drunk coffee from earlier. Nothing out of place.

But it felt wrong.

The air was thick, heavy, pressing down on me like a weight. And it smelled different‚Äîstale, like the air hadn‚Äôt moved in years. My own apartment had never smelled like this.

Milo refused to come inside. He planted his paws firmly at the threshold, leash stretched tight, eyes locked on something I couldn‚Äôt see.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúMilo, come on.‚Äù

He whined again, taking a step back.

I sighed, unhooking his leash. ‚ÄúFine. Stay out here.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt hesitate. He bolted down the hallway, tail tucked.

I stared after him, unease curling in my chest. Milo had never run from anything before.

The door shut behind me with a soft click.

The sound made my breath catch. I hadn‚Äôt touched it.

I turned slowly, heart hammering.

The living room was empty.

I forced myself to breathe, to move. My phone buzzed in my pocket, but I ignored it. Instead, I walked toward the hallway leading to my bedroom‚Äîstep by step, my legs stiff, my body resisting.

I reached my door. It was slightly open. Had it been like that before?

I pushed it fully open.

My bed was made. My dresser untouched. The only thing out of place was my closet door.

It was open. Just a crack.

And something was breathing inside.

Shallow, raspy, like the air was being pulled through teeth.

I froze.

The sound didn‚Äôt stop.

Didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt acknowledge me.

I reached for my phone, hands trembling, finally looking at the message Olivia had sent.

# ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go near the closet.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have time to react before the closet door creaked open another inch.

And something inside whispered*, ‚ÄúI told you not to come back.‚Äù*

The whisper curled through the air like smoke, seeping into my skin. My breath hitched, and I stepped back, my body screaming at me to run.

Then the closet door slammed open.

An icy gust shot through the room, knocking over a lamp and rattling the pictures on the wall. My phone slipped from my fingers, clattering to the floor. I tried to move, but something wrapped around my wrist‚Äîinvisible, cold, crushing.

I choked on a scream.

The pressure tightened, yanking me forward with a force that sent me stumbling toward the closet. My knees hit the ground hard. The room blurred around me as the grip spread, clawing up my arm, pressing into my skin like fingers of ice.

I struggled, kicking, twisting‚Äîbut there was nothing there. No hands. No body. Just a crushing, suffocating force that refused to let go.

Then, a voice‚Äîlow, guttural, right against my ear.

*""You let me in.""*

Pain lanced through my chest, cold and sharp, like something had reached inside me and gripped my ribs. My vision wavered. The walls around me flickered‚Äîmy bedroom, then darkness, then something else. A rotting hallway. A place that wasn't here.

No, no, no‚Äî

I thrashed, but the force only pulled harder. My body inched closer to the gaping darkness of the closet. The air inside it wasn‚Äôt just dark‚Äîit was wrong. It had depth, like an open mouth waiting to swallow me whole.

I was being dragged in.

A guttural snarl ripped through the air.

Milo.

He shot into the room, teeth bared, his growl deep and primal. He lunged, snapping at whatever had me.

The force let go.

I gasped as I collapsed backward, my body trembling. The air shifted‚Äîthe presence recoiling.

Milo barked, snapping at the darkness inside the closet. The second his teeth clicked shut, the closet door slammed shut on its own.

The room fell silent.

My hands were shaking as I crawled backward, gasping for breath. My wrist throbbed‚Äîwhen I looked down, dark bruises were already blooming, shaped like fingerprints.

Milo stood between me and the closet, still growling, his fur bristling.

I forced myself up, grabbed my phone, and ran.

I didn‚Äôt stop. Not when the lights flickered as I passed. Not when I heard something scraping against the walls. Not even when I felt the icy breath on the back of my neck as I reached the door.

I threw it open, nearly tripping over myself as I stumbled into the hallway.

Milo followed, and the door slammed shut behind us.

I stood there, panting, staring at the door. My apartment. My home.

And from inside, muffled but clear‚Äî

A whisper.

*‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over.‚Äù*

My hands were still shaking when I unlocked my phone. I barely registered the sweat slicking my fingers or the way my breath came in sharp, ragged gasps. All I knew was that I had to call for help.

I tapped 9-1-1.

The ringing felt like it stretched for hours before a voice finally clicked in.

""Nine-one-one, what‚Äôs your emergency?""

I swallowed hard. ""Please, you have to send someone. There‚Äôs‚Äîthere‚Äôs something in my apartment. It attacked me. It‚Äôs not human.""

A pause. Then, in the most patronizing voice I‚Äôd ever heard:

""Ma‚Äôam, are you in immediate danger?""

I looked at my wrist. The bruises were deepening, spreading up my forearm like ink soaking into paper. I licked my lips. ""Yes. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but it‚Äôs real. Please, just send someone!""

Another pause.

""Are you alone?""

I glanced down at Milo. His ears were still pinned back, his tail stiff. He hadn‚Äôt taken his eyes off the door.

""No,"" I said. ""My dog is with me.""

Another beat of silence. Then, with the kind of detached boredom that made my stomach drop, the dispatcher said, ""Ma‚Äôam, have you been drinking or taking any substances tonight?""

My stomach twisted.

""No! I told you, something attacked me! I have bruises‚Äî""

""Have you been experiencing any stress recently? Lack of sleep? Have you had any prior‚Äî""

I hung up.

I knew that tone. The same one people use when they think you‚Äôre crazy.

Milo whined, pressing his head into my leg. My breath hitched, and I ran a hand through my hair, trying to keep from shaking apart.

They didn‚Äôt believe me.

No one would believe me.

Then the pounding on my door sent Milo into a frenzy. His barking was sharp, frantic, but I barely heard it over the ringing in my ears. The laughter from my phone had stopped the moment the first knock hit.

""Police!"" a voice called. ""Open up!""

I hesitated.

For days, I had begged for someone to believe me. But now that they were here, dread coiled in my stomach.

I forced myself to my feet and opened the door.

Two officers stood there‚Äîa man and a woman, both watching me with careful, unreadable expressions. Behind them, my neighbor, Mrs. Calloway, peered out from her doorway, clutching her robe closed.

""Ma‚Äôam, we received multiple calls about screaming from this unit,"" the male officer said. His name tag read Officer Reynolds. His partner, Officer Vega, stood with her arms crossed, scanning the apartment.

I swallowed.

""I‚ÄîIt wasn‚Äôt me,"" I said, but my voice cracked.

Vega‚Äôs gaze landed on my bruised arms.

""Are you hurt?"" she asked.

I shook my head. ""It‚Äôs not‚ÄîIt‚Äôs not what you think.""

Reynolds sighed. ""Ma‚Äôam, can we step inside?""

I hesitated. If they came in, they‚Äôd feel it. The way the air in my apartment was wrong. The way the shadows clung to the corners like they were waiting.

But I stepped aside.

Vega‚Äôs eyes flickered to my living room. The mess of papers, the empty coffee cups, the scattered printouts on hauntings, possessions‚Äîproof that I was deep in something I couldn‚Äôt escape.

""You been sleeping much?"" Reynolds asked.

I clenched my jaw. ""I‚Äî""

Vega‚Äôs radio crackled.

""10-96,"" the dispatcher‚Äôs voice said.

My stomach dropped. 10-96.¬†

They weren‚Äôt here to help me.

They were here to take me in.

I took a step back, but Vega caught my arm. ""Ma‚Äôam, we‚Äôre going to have you come with us for a quick evaluation, okay?""

""No."" I pulled away. ""You don‚Äôt understand. There‚Äôs something here. It‚Äôs real. It‚Äî""

Reynolds pulled out handcuffs. ""Let‚Äôs not make this difficult.""

Milo growled.

The room tilted.

Something shifted behind me. I felt the air grow heavy, the unseen presence curling around my neck like fingers ready to squeeze.

I tried one last time. ""Please. You have to listen to me.""

Reynolds just sighed. ""Yeah. I‚Äôve heard that one before.""

The psych ward smelled like antiseptic and old air conditioning. The walls were white. Too white. Like a place built to scrub the mind clean.

They took my phone. My camera. My notes.

They gave me a gray jumpsuit and a stiff bed in a room with no sharp edges. The window didn‚Äôt open. The door had a small slot for food trays.

I sat on the bed, staring at my bruised arms, at the way the darkness still lingered under my skin like fingerprints.

Maybe they were right. Maybe I had lost it.

But then‚Äî

A creak.

The air shifted.

I turned slowly.

The chair in the corner moved an inch.

A whisper slid along the walls, curling into my ear.

*""I told you. I see you.""*

1ii9i6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1ii9i6r/the_late_night_text/,The Late Night Text,"I was about to go to bed when my phone buzzed.

A text from Olivia.

‚ÄúHey, can you come over?‚Äù

I frowned. Olivia was out of town. I knew that for a fact because I had dropped her off at the airport two days ago. We even joked about how her flight would probably be delayed, but she texted me when she landed. She was with her parents. Three states away.

I typed back: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you in Chicago?‚Äù

Three dots appeared. Then they vanished.

A few seconds later, another message came through.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for you inside.‚Äù

I felt my body go cold.

I stared at the screen, my fingers tightening around my phone. Maybe she left a key with someone. Maybe she came home early and forgot to tell me.

But then why did that message feel wrong?

I hesitated before replying. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù

No answer.

The room around me suddenly felt too quiet, like the air itself was listening.

I stood up, grabbed my keys, and left.

The drive to Olivia‚Äôs apartment was a blur. The streets were nearly empty, just the occasional car passing by, headlights flashing like warnings. My mind raced through possibilities. A prank? A break-in?

Or something worse?

When I pulled up to her building, everything looked normal. Too normal. Her window was dark. The parking lot empty.

I climbed the stairs, every step echoing in the silence. When I reached her door, I hesitated.

Then, I knocked.

The sound barely carried down the hallway.

No answer.

I knocked again, harder this time. ‚ÄúOlivia?‚Äù

Nothing.

I tried the handle, expecting it to be locked.

It wasn‚Äôt.

The door swung open with a slow, aching creak.

The apartment was dark. Stale. Like no one had been inside for days.

I stepped in, my pulse hammering against my ribs. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Silence.

Then‚Äî

A soft creak from the bedroom.

I froze.

Something shifted in the darkness beyond the hallway. A floorboard settling. A breath.

I reached for the light switch and flicked it on. The living room looked exactly as Olivia had left it. A blanket draped over the couch. A half-full glass of water on the coffee table. A pile of unopened mail near the door.

But the air felt wrong. Thick. Heavy.

Like I wasn‚Äôt alone.

Another creak. The bedroom door was cracked open just an inch, a sliver of darkness pressing against the dim hallway light.

My feet moved before I could think. I reached for the doorknob.

Then‚Äî

My phone buzzed.

The sound made me jump. I fumbled to pull it out of my pocket, my fingers numb.

A new message.

From Olivia.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go inside.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. My mouth went dry.

I wasn‚Äôt breathing. I wasn‚Äôt moving.

But I felt it.

A presence.

Right behind me.

The force let go.

I gasped as I collapsed backward, my body trembling. The air shifted‚Äîthe presence recoiling.

Milo barked, snapping at the darkness inside the closet. The second his teeth clicked shut, the closet door slammed shut on its own.

The room fell silent.

My hands were shaking as I crawled backward, gasping for breath. My wrist throbbed‚Äîwhen I looked down, dark bruises were already blooming, shaped like fingerprints.

Milo stood between me and the closet, still growling, his fur bristling.

I forced myself up, grabbed my phone, and ran.

I didn‚Äôt stop. Not when the lights flickered as I passed. Not when I heard something scraping against the walls. Not even when I felt the icy breath on the back of my neck as I reached the door.

I threw it open, nearly tripping over myself as I stumbled into the hallway.

Milo followed, and the door slammed shut behind us.

I stood there, panting, staring at the door. My apartment. My home.

And from inside, muffled but clear‚Äî

A whisper.

*‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over.‚Äù*

My hands were still shaking when I unlocked my phone. I barely registered the sweat slicking my fingers or the way my breath came in sharp, ragged gasps. All I knew was that I had to call for help.

I tapped 9-1-1.

The ringing felt like it stretched for hours before a voice finally clicked in.

""Nine-one-one, what‚Äôs your emergency?""

I swallowed hard. ""Please, you have to send someone. There‚Äôs‚Äîthere‚Äôs something in my apartment. It attacked me. It‚Äôs not human.""

A pause. Then, in the most patronizing voice I‚Äôd ever heard:

""Ma‚Äôam, are you in immediate danger?""

I looked at my wrist. The bruises were deepening, spreading up my forearm like ink soaking into paper. I licked my lips. ""Yes. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but it‚Äôs real. Please, just send someone!""

Another pause.

""Are you alone?""

I glanced down at Milo. His ears were still pinned back, his tail stiff. He hadn‚Äôt taken his eyes off the door.

""No,"" I said. ""My dog is with me.""

Another beat of silence. Then, with the kind of detached boredom that made my stomach drop, the dispatcher said, ""Ma‚Äôam, have you been drinking or taking any substances tonight?""

My stomach twisted.

""No! I told you, something attacked me! I have bruises‚Äî""

""Have you been experiencing any stress recently? Lack of sleep? Have you had any prior‚Äî""

I hung up.

I knew that tone. The same one people use when they think you‚Äôre crazy.

Milo whined, pressing his head into my leg. My breath hitched, and I ran a hand through my hair, trying to keep from shaking apart.

They didn‚Äôt believe me.

No one would believe me.

Then the pounding on my door sent Milo into a frenzy. His barking was sharp, frantic, but I barely heard it over the ringing in my ears. The laughter from my phone had stopped the moment the first knock hit.

""Police!"" a voice called. ""Open up!""

I hesitated.

For days, I had begged for someone to believe me. But now that they were here, dread coiled in my stomach.

I forced myself to my feet and opened the door.

Two officers stood there‚Äîa man and a woman, both watching me with careful, unreadable expressions. Behind them, my neighbor, Mrs. Calloway, peered out from her doorway, clutching her robe closed.

""Ma‚Äôam, we received multiple calls about screaming from this unit,"" the male officer said. His name tag read Officer Reynolds. His partner, Officer Vega, stood with her arms crossed, scanning the apartment.

I swallowed.

""I‚ÄîIt wasn‚Äôt me,"" I said, but my voice cracked.

Vega‚Äôs gaze landed on my bruised arms.

""Are you hurt?"" she asked.

I shook my head. ""It‚Äôs not‚ÄîIt‚Äôs not what you think.""

Reynolds sighed. ""Ma‚Äôam, can we step inside?""

I hesitated. If they came in, they‚Äôd feel it. The way the air in my apartment was wrong. The way the shadows clung to the corners like they were waiting.

But I stepped aside.

Vega‚Äôs eyes flickered to my living room. The mess of papers, the empty coffee cups, the scattered printouts on hauntings, possessions‚Äîproof that I was deep in something I couldn‚Äôt escape.

""You been sleeping much?"" Reynolds asked.

I clenched my jaw. ""I‚Äî""

Vega‚Äôs radio crackled.

""10-96,"" the dispatcher‚Äôs voice said.

My stomach dropped. 10-96.¬†

They weren‚Äôt here to help me.

They were here to take me in.

I took a step back, but Vega caught my arm. ""Ma‚Äôam, we‚Äôre going to have you come with us for a quick evaluation, okay?""

""No."" I pulled away. ""You don‚Äôt understand. There‚Äôs something here. It‚Äôs real. It‚Äî""

Reynolds pulled out handcuffs. ""Let‚Äôs not make this difficult.""

Milo growled.

The room tilted.

Something shifted behind me. I felt the air grow heavy, the unseen presence curling around my neck like fingers ready to squeeze.

I tried one last time. ""Please. You have to listen to me.""

Reynolds just sighed. ""Yeah. I‚Äôve heard that one before.""

The psych ward smelled like antiseptic and old air conditioning. The walls were white. Too white. Like a place built to scrub the mind clean.

They took my phone. My camera. My notes.

They gave me a gray jumpsuit and a stiff bed in a room with no sharp edges. The window didn‚Äôt open. The door had a small slot for food trays.

I sat on the bed, staring at my bruised arms, at the way the darkness still lingered under my skin like fingerprints.

Maybe they were right. Maybe I had lost it.

But then‚Äî

A creak.

The air shifted.

I turned slowly.

The chair in the corner moved an inch.

A whisper slid along the walls, curling into my ear.

*""I told you. I see you.""*

1ii9i3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1ii9i3t/the_late_night_text/,The Late Night Text,"I was about to go to bed when my phone buzzed.

A text from Olivia.

‚ÄúHey, can you come over?‚Äù

I frowned. Olivia was out of town. I knew that for a fact because I had dropped her off at the airport two days ago. We even joked about how her flight would probably be delayed, but she texted me when she landed. She was with her parents. Three states away.

I typed back: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you in Chicago?‚Äù

Three dots appeared. Then they vanished.

A few seconds later, another message came through.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for you inside.‚Äù

I felt my body go cold.

I stared at the screen, my fingers tightening around my phone. Maybe she left a key with someone. Maybe she came home early and forgot to tell me.

But then why did that message feel wrong?

I hesitated before replying. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù

No answer.

The room around me suddenly felt too quiet, like the air itself was listening.

I stood up, grabbed my keys, and left.

The drive to Olivia‚Äôs apartment was a blur. The streets were nearly empty, just the occasional car passing by, headlights flashing like warnings. My mind raced through possibilities. A prank? A break-in?

Or something worse?

When I pulled up to her building, everything looked normal. Too normal. Her window was dark. The parking lot empty.

I climbed the stairs, every step echoing in the silence. When I reached her door, I hesitated.

Then, I knocked.

The sound barely carried down the hallway.

No answer.

I knocked again, harder this time. ‚ÄúOlivia?‚Äù

Nothing.

I tried the handle, expecting it to be locked.

It wasn‚Äôt.

The door swung open with a slow, aching creak.

The apartment was dark. Stale. Like no one had been inside for days.

I stepped in, my pulse hammering against my ribs. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Silence.

Then‚Äî

A soft creak from the bedroom.

I froze.

Something shifted in the darkness beyond the hallway. A floorboard settling. A breath.

I reached for the light switch and flicked it on. The living room looked exactly as Olivia had left it. A blanket draped over the couch. A half-full glass of water on the coffee table. A pile of unopened mail near the door.

But the air felt wrong. Thick. Heavy.

Like I wasn‚Äôt alone.

Another creak. The bedroom door was cracked open just an inch, a sliver of darkness pressing against the dim hallway light.

My feet moved before I could think. I reached for the doorknob.

Then‚Äî

My phone buzzed.

The sound made me jump. I fumbled to pull it out of my pocket, my fingers numb.

A new message.

From Olivia.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go inside.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. My mouth went dry.

I wasn‚Äôt breathing. I wasn‚Äôt moving.

But I felt it.

A presence.

Right behind me.

And then‚Äî

The bedroom door creaked open wider.

I nearly dropped my phone. My heart was hammering so hard I could hear it in my ears.

The bedroom door creaked open wider, the darkness inside shifting. I braced myself, body locked in place, every instinct screaming at me to run.

Then‚Äî

A familiar shape stepped out.

A dog.

Olivia‚Äôs golden retriever, Milo.

Relief hit me so fast I almost laughed. My legs went weak, and I leaned against the wall, exhaling sharply. ‚ÄúJesus, Milo. You scared the hell out of me.‚Äù

Milo blinked up at me, tail wagging slightly, but something about him seemed‚Ä¶ off. His fur was matted in places, like he hadn‚Äôt been brushed in days. His paws left faint smudges on the hardwood, tracks of something I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. His eyes, usually warm and full of life, seemed darker. Duller.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get out?‚Äù I muttered, kneeling to scratch behind his ears. He felt cold. Too cold.

I glanced around the apartment again. Everything looked the same, but that feeling‚Äîlike something was watching me‚Äîhadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had settled deeper, like it had wrapped itself around the walls.

Milo whined softly, pressing his nose against my leg.

I looked down at him. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your leash?‚Äù

He just stared at me.

The air in the apartment was too still, like the whole place was holding its breath. I swallowed, shaking off the lingering unease. Maybe Olivia‚Äôs text was just a bad joke. Maybe she had asked someone to check on Milo, and they forgot to lock up.

Still, something gnawed at me.

I pulled out my phone, rereading the message:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go inside.‚Äù

I hesitated, then typed back: ‚ÄúVery funny. Milo just scared me half to death.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. Then they vanished.

I frowned. Olivia always texted fast.

Milo let out a soft whimper. His ears flattened, eyes flicking toward the bedroom.

I followed his gaze. The door was still open, revealing nothing but thick, suffocating darkness inside.

I hadn‚Äôt turned the bedroom light off.

Had I?

Milo took a step back, pressing against my leg.

The air suddenly felt colder.

I swallowed hard and forced out a laugh. ‚ÄúAlright, bud. Let‚Äôs get you outside.‚Äù

I grabbed his leash from the hook by the door, clipping it onto his collar with shaking hands. The second I opened the front door, Milo bolted, nearly yanking me off my feet.

I barely managed to keep hold of the leash as he dragged me down the hallway, his nails clicking frantically against the tile. His whole body trembled like he couldn‚Äôt get away fast enough.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

I locked the apartment behind me and followed Milo down the stairs, that last message from Olivia burning in my mind.

If Milo was inside‚Ä¶ who opened the bedroom door?

Milo didn‚Äôt stop pulling until we were outside, paws scuffing against the pavement as he dragged me toward the nearest patch of grass. He was shaking, ears flattened, tail tucked so tightly between his legs that it barely moved.

I knelt beside him, running my hands over his fur. His breathing was fast, his chest rising and falling in sharp, panicked bursts.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, buddy,‚Äù I murmured, though I wasn‚Äôt sure if I believed it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alright.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt look up. He just stared at the apartment building, eyes locked on my window.

I followed his gaze.

The bedroom light was back on.

I sucked in a breath, pulse hammering in my throat. I hadn‚Äôt touched the switch before leaving. Hadn‚Äôt even stepped inside the room.

Slowly, I reached for my phone.

‚ÄúOlivia. This isn‚Äôt funny. Is someone in your apartment?‚Äù

The message delivered instantly. No typing bubble appeared.

Milo let out a low whimper, pressing against my leg. I felt his whole body tense as if he was waiting for something.

I swallowed hard and looked back up at the window.

The light flickered.

Once.

Then, again.

Like someone was standing inside. Moving.

My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúOlivia, answer me.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. My fingers clenched around the phone.

Then the reply came.

# ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs with you?‚Äù

The words sent a sharp chill through me. I looked around, my breath fogging in the night air.

I was alone.

I stared at the message, confusion twisting into something colder.

# ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

Nothing. No response.

The window light flickered once more. Then it went out.

The apartment was dark again.

Milo let out a low growl.

Something about the night felt heavier, like the air had thickened, pressing in around me. I gripped his leash tighter, my free hand curling into a fist to stop the tremor in my fingers.

I needed to leave. I needed to turn around and walk away, call Olivia, and tell her to get her locks changed the second she got home.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at that window.

Because the longer I looked‚Ä¶ the more I was sure‚Äî

Someone was still standing there. Watching.

Waiting.

Milo‚Äôs growl deepened, a low, rumbling warning that sent another chill up my spine. I wanted to look away from the window, to convince myself I was imagining things, but I couldn‚Äôt.

There was a shape in the darkness.

Not a reflection, not a shadow‚Äîsomething was standing inside Olivia‚Äôs apartment. It wasn‚Äôt moving, but I could feel it watching me.

I took a step back. Milo let out a sharp bark, yanking against the leash. The noise echoed down the quiet street, but nothing inside the apartment changed. The figure didn‚Äôt shift. Didn‚Äôt flinch. It just stood there.

My phone buzzed in my hand.

# ‚ÄúGet out of there.‚Äù

I barely had time to process the message before the light in her apartment flickered back on.

And the figure was gone.

My breath caught in my throat. My legs felt locked in place, every muscle screaming at me to move. I forced myself to look around‚Äîat the street, at the other buildings, at the empty parking lot. Everything else was completely normal.

Then my phone buzzed again.

# ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. Don‚Äôt go back inside.‚Äù

I swallowed hard and typed with shaky fingers.

# ‚ÄúWho is in your apartment?‚Äù

The reply came instantly.

# ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my apartment.‚Äù

The cold inside my chest spread like ice water through my veins.

Not hers? I stared at the screen, rereading the words over and over. My pulse hammered in my ears, drowning out everything else.

I turned to Milo, who was still tense, ears pinned back. His body trembled under my hand. He was scared. More scared than I‚Äôd ever seen him.

That should have been enough.

That should have sent me running.

But instead, I found myself stepping forward, gripping my keys so tightly they bit into my palm.

I needed to know.

I needed to see.

Because if that wasn‚Äôt Olivia‚Äôs apartment‚Ä¶

Then whose was it?

And why did it know my name?

My feet felt heavy as I stepped toward the apartment door. Every instinct screamed at me to turn around, to listen to Olivia, to listen to Milo‚Äîwho was now whining, pulling at his leash in the opposite direction.

But I couldn‚Äôt leave. Not yet.

I reached out, my fingers grazing the doorknob. Cold. Too cold. Like it had been sitting in ice. My stomach twisted, but I forced myself to turn it. The door swung open with a slow creak.

The apartment was exactly as I had left it.

Lights on. Couch slightly askew. The kitchen counter still had my half-drunk coffee from earlier. Nothing out of place.

But it felt wrong.

The air was thick, heavy, pressing down on me like a weight. And it smelled different‚Äîstale, like the air hadn‚Äôt moved in years. My own apartment had never smelled like this.

Milo refused to come inside. He planted his paws firmly at the threshold, leash stretched tight, eyes locked on something I couldn‚Äôt see.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúMilo, come on.‚Äù

He whined again, taking a step back.

I sighed, unhooking his leash. ‚ÄúFine. Stay out here.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt hesitate. He bolted down the hallway, tail tucked.

I stared after him, unease curling in my chest. Milo had never run from anything before.

The door shut behind me with a soft click.

The sound made my breath catch. I hadn‚Äôt touched it.

I turned slowly, heart hammering.

The living room was empty.

I forced myself to breathe, to move. My phone buzzed in my pocket, but I ignored it. Instead, I walked toward the hallway leading to my bedroom‚Äîstep by step, my legs stiff, my body resisting.

I reached my door. It was slightly open. Had it been like that before?

I pushed it fully open.

My bed was made. My dresser untouched. The only thing out of place was my closet door.

It was open. Just a crack.

And something was breathing inside.

Shallow, raspy, like the air was being pulled through teeth.

I froze.

The sound didn‚Äôt stop.

Didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt acknowledge me.

I reached for my phone, hands trembling, finally looking at the message Olivia had sent.

# ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go near the closet.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have time to react before the closet door creaked open another inch.

And something inside whispered*, ‚ÄúI told you not to come back.‚Äù*

The whisper curled through the air like smoke, seeping into my skin. My breath hitched, and I stepped back, my body screaming at me to run.

Then the closet door slammed open.

An icy gust shot through the room, knocking over a lamp and rattling the pictures on the wall. My phone slipped from my fingers, clattering to the floor. I tried to move, but something wrapped around my wrist‚Äîinvisible, cold, crushing.

I choked on a scream.

The pressure tightened, yanking me forward with a force that sent me stumbling toward the closet. My knees hit the ground hard. The room blurred around me as the grip spread, clawing up my arm, pressing into my skin like fingers of ice.

I struggled, kicking, twisting‚Äîbut there was nothing there. No hands. No body. Just a crushing, suffocating force that refused to let go.

Then, a voice‚Äîlow, guttural, right against my ear.

*""You let me in.""*

Pain lanced through my chest, cold and sharp, like something had reached inside me and gripped my ribs. My vision wavered. The walls around me flickered‚Äîmy bedroom, then darkness, then something else. A rotting hallway. A place that wasn't here.

No, no, no‚Äî

I thrashed, but the force only pulled harder. My body inched closer to the gaping darkness of the closet. The air inside it wasn‚Äôt just dark‚Äîit was wrong. It had depth, like an open mouth waiting to swallow me whole.

I was being dragged in.

A guttural snarl ripped through the air.

Milo.

He shot into the room, teeth bared, his growl deep and primal. He lunged, snapping at whatever had me.

The force let go.

I gasped as I collapsed backward, my body trembling. The air shifted‚Äîthe presence recoiling.

Milo barked, snapping at the darkness inside the closet. The second his teeth clicked shut, the closet door slammed shut on its own.

Milo let out a soft whimper. His ears flattened, eyes flicking toward the bedroom.

I followed his gaze. The door was still open, revealing nothing but thick, suffocating darkness inside.

I hadn‚Äôt turned the bedroom light off.

Had I?

Milo took a step back, pressing against my leg.

The air suddenly felt colder.

I swallowed hard and forced out a laugh. ‚ÄúAlright, bud. Let‚Äôs get you outside.‚Äù

I grabbed his leash from the hook by the door, clipping it onto his collar with shaking hands. The second I opened the front door, Milo bolted, nearly yanking me off my feet.

I barely managed to keep hold of the leash as he dragged me down the hallway, his nails clicking frantically against the tile. His whole body trembled like he couldn‚Äôt get away fast enough.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

I locked the apartment behind me and followed Milo down the stairs, that last message from Olivia burning in my mind.

If Milo was inside‚Ä¶ who opened the bedroom door?

Milo didn‚Äôt stop pulling until we were outside, paws scuffing against the pavement as he dragged me toward the nearest patch of grass. He was shaking, ears flattened, tail tucked so tightly between his legs that it barely moved.

I knelt beside him, running my hands over his fur. His breathing was fast, his chest rising and falling in sharp, panicked bursts.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, buddy,‚Äù I murmured, though I wasn‚Äôt sure if I believed it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alright.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt look up. He just stared at the apartment building, eyes locked on my window.

I followed his gaze.

The bedroom light was back on.

I sucked in a breath, pulse hammering in my throat. I hadn‚Äôt touched the switch before leaving. Hadn‚Äôt even stepped inside the room.

Slowly, I reached for my phone.

‚ÄúOlivia. This isn‚Äôt funny. Is someone in your apartment?‚Äù

The message delivered instantly. No typing bubble appeared.

Milo let out a low whimper, pressing against my leg. I felt his whole body tense as if he was waiting for something.

I swallowed hard and looked back up at the window.

The light flickered.

Once.

Then, again.

Like someone was standing inside. Moving.

My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúOlivia, answer me.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. My fingers clenched around the phone.

Then the reply came.

# ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs with you?‚Äù

The words sent a sharp chill through me. I looked around, my breath fogging in the night air.

I was alone.

I stared at the message, confusion twisting into something colder.

# ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

Nothing. No response.

The window light flickered once more. Then it went out.

The apartment was dark again.

Milo let out a low growl.

Something about the night felt heavier, like the air had thickened, pressing in around me. I gripped his leash tighter, my free hand curling into a fist to stop the tremor in my fingers.

I needed to leave. I needed to turn around and walk away, call Olivia, and tell her to get her locks changed the second she got home.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at that window.

Because the longer I looked‚Ä¶ the more I was sure‚Äî

Someone was still standing there. Watching.

Waiting.

Milo‚Äôs growl deepened, a low, rumbling warning that sent another chill up my spine. I wanted to look away from the window, to convince myself I was imagining things, but I couldn‚Äôt.

There was a shape in the darkness.

Not a reflection, not a shadow‚Äîsomething was standing inside Olivia‚Äôs apartment. It wasn‚Äôt moving, but I could feel it watching me.

I took a step back. Milo let out a sharp bark, yanking against the leash. The noise echoed down the quiet street, but nothing inside the apartment changed. The figure didn‚Äôt shift. Didn‚Äôt flinch. It just stood there.

My phone buzzed in my hand.

# ‚ÄúGet out of there.‚Äù

I barely had time to process the message before the light in her apartment flickered back on.

And the figure was gone.

My breath caught in my throat. My legs felt locked in place, every muscle screaming at me to move. I forced myself to look around‚Äîat the street, at the other buildings, at the empty parking lot. Everything else was completely normal.

Then my phone buzzed again.

# ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. Don‚Äôt go back inside.‚Äù

I swallowed hard and typed with shaky fingers.

# ‚ÄúWho is in your apartment?‚Äù

The reply came instantly.

# ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my apartment.‚Äù

The cold inside my chest spread like ice water through my veins.

Not hers? I stared at the screen, rereading the words over and over. My pulse hammered in my ears, drowning out everything else.

I turned to Milo, who was still tense, ears pinned back. His body trembled under my hand. He was scared. More scared than I‚Äôd ever seen him.

That should have been enough.

That should have sent me running.

But instead, I found myself stepping forward, gripping my keys so tightly they bit into my palm.

I needed to know.

I needed to see.

Because if that wasn‚Äôt Olivia‚Äôs apartment‚Ä¶

Then whose was it?

And why did it know my name?

My feet felt heavy as I stepped toward the apartment door. Every instinct screamed at me to turn around, to listen to Olivia, to listen to Milo‚Äîwho was now whining, pulling at his leash in the opposite direction.

But I couldn‚Äôt leave. Not yet.

I reached out, my fingers grazing the doorknob. Cold. Too cold. Like it had been sitting in ice. My stomach twisted, but I forced myself to turn it. The door swung open with a slow creak.

The apartment was exactly as I had left it.

Lights on. Couch slightly askew. The kitchen counter still had my half-drunk coffee from earlier. Nothing out of place.

But it felt wrong.

The air was thick, heavy, pressing down on me like a weight. And it smelled different‚Äîstale, like the air hadn‚Äôt moved in years. My own apartment had never smelled like this.

Milo refused to come inside. He planted his paws firmly at the threshold, leash stretched tight, eyes locked on something I couldn‚Äôt see.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúMilo, come on.‚Äù

He whined again, taking a step back.

I sighed, unhooking his leash. ‚ÄúFine. Stay out here.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt hesitate. He bolted down the hallway, tail tucked.

I stared after him, unease curling in my chest. Milo had never run from anything before.

The door shut behind me with a soft click.

The sound made my breath catch. I hadn‚Äôt touched it.

I turned slowly, heart hammering.

The living room was empty.

I forced myself to breathe, to move. My phone buzzed in my pocket, but I ignored it. Instead, I walked toward the hallway leading to my bedroom‚Äîstep by step, my legs stiff, my body resisting.

I reached my door. It was slightly open. Had it been like that before?

I pushed it fully open.

My bed was made. My dresser untouched. The only thing out of place was my closet door.

It was open. Just a crack.

And something was breathing inside.

Shallow, raspy, like the air was being pulled through teeth.

I froze.

The sound didn‚Äôt stop.

Didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt acknowledge me.

I reached for my phone, hands trembling, finally looking at the message Olivia had sent.

# ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go near the closet.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have time to react before the closet door creaked open another inch.

And something inside whispered*, ‚ÄúI told you not to come back.‚Äù*

The whisper curled through the air like smoke, seeping into my skin. My breath hitched, and I stepped back, my body screaming at me to run.

Then the closet door slammed open.

An icy gust shot through the room, knocking over a lamp and rattling the pictures on the wall. My phone slipped from my fingers, clattering to the floor. I tried to move, but something wrapped around my wrist‚Äîinvisible, cold, crushing.

I choked on a scream.

The pressure tightened, yanking me forward with a force that sent me stumbling toward the closet. My knees hit the ground hard. The room blurred around me as the grip spread, clawing up my arm, pressing into my skin like fingers of ice.

I struggled, kicking, twisting‚Äîbut there was nothing there. No hands. No body. Just a crushing, suffocating force that refused to let go.

Then, a voice‚Äîlow, guttural, right against my ear.

*""You let me in.""*

Pain lanced through my chest, cold and sharp, like something had reached inside me and gripped my ribs. My vision wavered. The walls around me flickered‚Äîmy bedroom, then darkness, then something else. A rotting hallway. A place that wasn't here.

No, no, no‚Äî

I thrashed, but the force only pulled harder. My body inched closer to the gaping darkness of the closet. The air inside it wasn‚Äôt just dark‚Äîit was wrong. It had depth, like an open mouth waiting to swallow me whole.

I was being dragged in.

A guttural snarl ripped through the air.

Milo.

He shot into the room, teeth bared, his growl deep and primal. He lunged, snapping at whatever had me.

The force let go.

I gasped as I collapsed backward, my body trembling. The air shifted‚Äîthe presence recoiling.

Milo barked, snapping at the darkness inside the closet. The second his teeth clicked shut, the closet door slammed shut on its own.

The room fell silent.

My hands were shaking as I crawled backward, gasping for breath. My wrist throbbed‚Äîwhen I looked down, dark bruises were already blooming, shaped like fingerprints.

Milo stood between me and the closet, still growling, his fur bristling.

I forced myself up, grabbed my phone, and ran.

I didn‚Äôt stop. Not when the lights flickered as I passed. Not when I heard something scraping against the walls. Not even when I felt the icy breath on the back of my neck as I reached the door.

I threw it open, nearly tripping over myself as I stumbled into the hallway.

Milo followed, and the door slammed shut behind us.

I stood there, panting, staring at the door. My apartment. My home.

And from inside, muffled but clear‚Äî

A whisper.

*‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over.‚Äù*

My hands were still shaking when I unlocked my phone. I barely registered the sweat slicking my fingers or the way my breath came in sharp, ragged gasps. All I knew was that I had to call for help.

I tapped 9-1-1.

The ringing felt like it stretched for hours before a voice finally clicked in.

""Nine-one-one, what‚Äôs your emergency?""

I swallowed hard. ""Please, you have to send someone. There‚Äôs‚Äîthere‚Äôs something in my apartment. It attacked me. It‚Äôs not human.""

A pause. Then, in the most patronizing voice I‚Äôd ever heard:

""Ma‚Äôam, are you in immediate danger?""

I looked at my wrist. The bruises were deepening, spreading up my forearm like ink soaking into paper. I licked my lips. ""Yes. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but it‚Äôs real. Please, just send someone!""

Another pause.

""Are you alone?""

I glanced down at Milo. His ears were still pinned back, his tail stiff. He hadn‚Äôt taken his eyes off the door.

""No,"" I said. ""My dog is with me.""

Another beat of silence. Then, with the kind of detached boredom that made my stomach drop, the dispatcher said, ""Ma‚Äôam, have you been drinking or taking any substances tonight?""

My stomach twisted.

""No! I told you, something attacked me! I have bruises‚Äî""

""Have you been experiencing any stress recently? Lack of sleep? Have you had any prior‚Äî""

I hung up.

I knew that tone. The same one people use when they think you‚Äôre crazy.

Milo whined, pressing his head into my leg. My breath hitched, and I ran a hand through my hair, trying to keep from shaking apart.

They didn‚Äôt believe me.

No one would believe me.

Then the pounding on my door sent Milo into a frenzy. His barking was sharp, frantic, but I barely heard it over the ringing in my ears. The laughter from my phone had stopped the moment the first knock hit.

""Police!"" a voice called. ""Open up!""

I hesitated.

For days, I had begged for someone to believe me. But now that they were here, dread coiled in my stomach.

I forced myself to my feet and opened the door.

Two officers stood there‚Äîa man and a woman, both watching me with careful, unreadable expressions. Behind them, my neighbor, Mrs. Calloway, peered out from her doorway, clutching her robe closed.

""Ma‚Äôam, we received multiple calls about screaming from this unit,"" the male officer said. His name tag read Officer Reynolds. His partner, Officer Vega, stood with her arms crossed, scanning the apartment.

I swallowed.

""I‚ÄîIt wasn‚Äôt me,"" I said, but my voice cracked.

Vega‚Äôs gaze landed on my bruised arms.

""Are you hurt?"" she asked.

I shook my head. ""It‚Äôs not‚ÄîIt‚Äôs not what you think.""

Reynolds sighed. ""Ma‚Äôam, can we step inside?""

I hesitated. If they came in, they‚Äôd feel it. The way the air in my apartment was wrong. The way the shadows clung to the corners like they were waiting.

But I stepped aside.

Vega‚Äôs eyes flickered to my living room. The mess of papers, the empty coffee cups, the scattered printouts on hauntings, possessions‚Äîproof that I was deep in something I couldn‚Äôt escape.

""You been sleeping much?"" Reynolds asked.

I clenched my jaw. ""I‚Äî""

Vega‚Äôs radio crackled.

""10-96,"" the dispatcher‚Äôs voice said.

My stomach dropped. 10-96.¬†

They weren‚Äôt here to help me.

They were here to take me in.

I took a step back, but Vega caught my arm. ""Ma‚Äôam, we‚Äôre going to have you come with us for a quick evaluation, okay?""

""No."" I pulled away. ""You don‚Äôt understand. There‚Äôs something here. It‚Äôs real. It‚Äî""

Reynolds pulled out handcuffs. ""Let‚Äôs not make this difficult.""

Milo growled.

The room tilted.

Something shifted behind me. I felt the air grow heavy, the unseen presence curling around my neck like fingers ready to squeeze.

I tried one last time. ""Please. You have to listen to me.""

Reynolds just sighed. ""Yeah. I‚Äôve heard that one before.""

The psych ward smelled like antiseptic and old air conditioning. The walls were white. Too white. Like a place built to scrub the mind clean.

They took my phone. My camera. My notes.

They gave me a gray jumpsuit and a stiff bed in a room with no sharp edges. The window didn‚Äôt open. The door had a small slot for food trays.

I sat on the bed, staring at my bruised arms, at the way the darkness still lingered under my skin like fingerprints.

Maybe they were right. Maybe I had lost it.

But then‚Äî

A creak.

The air shifted.

I turned slowly.

The chair in the corner moved an inch.

A whisper slid along the walls, curling into my ear.

*""I told you. I see you.""*

1ii9hyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ii9hyr/the_late_night_text/,The Late Night Text,"I was about to go to bed when my phone buzzed.

A text from Olivia.

‚ÄúHey, can you come over?‚Äù

I frowned. Olivia was out of town. I knew that for a fact because I had dropped her off at the airport two days ago. We even joked about how her flight would probably be delayed, but she texted me when she landed. She was with her parents. Three states away.

I typed back: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you in Chicago?‚Äù

Three dots appeared. Then they vanished.

A few seconds later, another message came through.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for you inside.‚Äù

I felt my body go cold.

I stared at the screen, my fingers tightening around my phone. Maybe she left a key with someone. Maybe she came home early and forgot to tell me.

But then why did that message feel wrong?

I hesitated before replying. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù

No answer.

The room around me suddenly felt too quiet, like the air itself was listening.

I stood up, grabbed my keys, and left.

The drive to Olivia‚Äôs apartment was a blur. The streets were nearly empty, just the occasional car passing by, headlights flashing like warnings. My mind raced through possibilities. A prank? A break-in?

Or something worse?

When I pulled up to her building, everything looked normal. Too normal. Her window was dark. The parking lot empty.

I climbed the stairs, every step echoing in the silence. When I reached her door, I hesitated.

Then, I knocked.

The sound barely carried down the hallway.

No answer.

I knocked again, harder this time. ‚ÄúOlivia?‚Äù

Nothing.

I tried the handle, expecting it to be locked.

It wasn‚Äôt.

The door swung open with a slow, aching creak.

The apartment was dark. Stale. Like no one had been inside for days.

I stepped in, my pulse hammering against my ribs. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Silence.

Then‚Äî

A soft creak from the bedroom.

I froze.

Something shifted in the darkness beyond the hallway. A floorboard settling. A breath.

I reached for the light switch and flicked it on. The living room looked exactly as Olivia had left it. A blanket draped over the couch. A half-full glass of water on the coffee table. A pile of unopened mail near the door.

But the air felt wrong. Thick. Heavy.

Like I wasn‚Äôt alone.

Another creak. The bedroom door was cracked open just an inch, a sliver of darkness pressing against the dim hallway light.

My feet moved before I could think. I reached for the doorknob.

Then‚Äî

My phone buzzed.

The sound made me jump. I fumbled to pull it out of my pocket, my fingers numb.

A new message.

From Olivia.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go inside.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. My mouth went dry.

I wasn‚Äôt breathing. I wasn‚Äôt moving.

But I felt it.

A presence.

Right behind me.

And then‚Äî

The bedroom door creaked open wider.

I nearly dropped my phone. My heart was hammering so hard I could hear it in my ears.

The bedroom door creaked open wider, the darkness inside shifting. I braced myself, body locked in place, every instinct screaming at me to run.

Then‚Äî

A familiar shape stepped out.

A dog.

Olivia‚Äôs golden retriever, Milo.

Relief hit me so fast I almost laughed. My legs went weak, and I leaned against the wall, exhaling sharply. ‚ÄúJesus, Milo. You scared the hell out of me.‚Äù

Milo blinked up at me, tail wagging slightly, but something about him seemed‚Ä¶ off. His fur was matted in places, like he hadn‚Äôt been brushed in days. His paws left faint smudges on the hardwood, tracks of something I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. His eyes, usually warm and full of life, seemed darker. Duller.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get out?‚Äù I muttered, kneeling to scratch behind his ears. He felt cold. Too cold.

I glanced around the apartment again. Everything looked the same, but that feeling‚Äîlike something was watching me‚Äîhadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had settled deeper, like it had wrapped itself around the walls.

Milo whined softly, pressing his nose against my leg.

I looked down at him. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your leash?‚Äù

He just stared at me.

The air in the apartment was too still, like the whole place was holding its breath. I swallowed, shaking off the lingering unease. Maybe Olivia‚Äôs text was just a bad joke. Maybe she had asked someone to check on Milo, and they forgot to lock up.

Still, something gnawed at me.

I pulled out my phone, rereading the message:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go inside.‚Äù

I hesitated, then typed back: ‚ÄúVery funny. Milo just scared me half to death.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. Then they vanished.

I frowned. Olivia always texted fast.

Milo let out a soft whimper. His ears flattened, eyes flicking toward the bedroom.

I followed his gaze. The door was still open, revealing nothing but thick, suffocating darkness inside.

I hadn‚Äôt turned the bedroom light off.

Had I?

Milo took a step back, pressing against my leg.

The air suddenly felt colder.

I swallowed hard and forced out a laugh. ‚ÄúAlright, bud. Let‚Äôs get you outside.‚Äù

I grabbed his leash from the hook by the door, clipping it onto his collar with shaking hands. The second I opened the front door, Milo bolted, nearly yanking me off my feet.

The bedroom light was back on.

I sucked in a breath, pulse hammering in my throat. I hadn‚Äôt touched the switch before leaving. Hadn‚Äôt even stepped inside the room.

My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúOlivia, answer me.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. My fingers clenched around the phone.

Then the reply came.

# ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs with you?‚Äù

The words sent a sharp chill through me. I looked around, my breath fogging in the night air.

I was alone.

I stared at the message, confusion twisting into something colder.

# ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

Nothing. No response.

The window light flickered once more. Then it went out.

The apartment was dark again.

Milo let out a low growl.

Something about the night felt heavier, like the air had thickened, pressing in around me. I gripped his leash tighter, my free hand curling into a fist to stop the tremor in my fingers.

My phone buzzed in my hand.

# ‚ÄúGet out of there.‚Äù

I barely had time to process the message before the light in her apartment flickered back on.

And the figure was gone.

My breath caught in my throat. My legs felt locked in place, every muscle screaming at me to move. I forced myself to look around‚Äîat the street, at the other buildings, at the empty parking lot. Everything else was completely normal.

The cold inside my chest spread like ice water through my veins.

I sighed, unhooking his leash. ‚ÄúFine. Stay out here.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt hesitate. He bolted down the hallway, tail tucked.

I stared after him, unease curling in my chest. Milo had never run from anything before.

The door shut behind me with a soft click.

Another pause.

""Are you alone?""

I glanced down at Milo. His ears were still pinned back, his tail stiff. He hadn‚Äôt taken his eyes off the door.

""No,"" I said. ""My dog is with me.""

Another beat of silence. Then, with the kind of detached boredom that made my stomach drop, the dispatcher said, ""Ma‚Äôam, have you been drinking or taking any substances tonight?""

My stomach twisted.

""No! I told you, something attacked me! I have bruises‚Äî""

""Have you been experiencing any stress recently? Lack of sleep? Have you had any prior‚Äî""

I hung up.

I knew that tone. The same one people use when they think you‚Äôre crazy.

Milo whined, pressing his head into my leg. My breath hitched, and I ran a hand through my hair, trying to keep from shaking apart.

They didn‚Äôt believe me.

No one would believe me.

Then the pounding on my door sent Milo into a frenzy. His barking was sharp, frantic, but I barely heard it over the ringing in my ears. The laughter from my phone had stopped the moment the first knock hit.

""Police!"" a voice called. ""Open up!""

I hesitated.

For days, I had begged for someone to believe me. But now that they were here, dread coiled in my stomach.

I forced myself to my feet and opened the door.

Two officers stood there‚Äîa man and a woman, both watching me with careful, unreadable expressions. Behind them, my neighbor, Mrs. Calloway, peered out from her doorway, clutching her robe closed.

""Ma‚Äôam, we received multiple calls about screaming from this unit,"" the male officer said. His name tag read Officer Reynolds. His partner, Officer Vega, stood with her arms crossed, scanning the apartment.

I swallowed.

""I‚ÄîIt wasn‚Äôt me,"" I said, but my voice cracked.

Vega‚Äôs gaze landed on my bruised arms.

""Are you hurt?"" she asked.

I shook my head. ""It‚Äôs not‚ÄîIt‚Äôs not what you think.""

Reynolds sighed. ""Ma‚Äôam, can we step inside?""

I hesitated. If they came in, they‚Äôd feel it. The way the air in my apartment was wrong. The way the shadows clung to the corners like they were waiting.

But I stepped aside.

Vega‚Äôs eyes flickered to my living room. The mess of papers, the empty coffee cups, the scattered printouts on hauntings, possessions‚Äîproof that I was deep in something I couldn‚Äôt escape.

""You been sleeping much?"" Reynolds asked.

I clenched my jaw. ""I‚Äî""

Vega‚Äôs radio crackled.

""10-96,"" the dispatcher‚Äôs voice said.

My stomach dropped. 10-96.¬†

They weren‚Äôt here to help me.

They were here to take me in.

I took a step back, but Vega caught my arm. ""Ma‚Äôam, we‚Äôre going to have you come with us for a quick evaluation, okay?""

""No."" I pulled away. ""You don‚Äôt understand. There‚Äôs something here. It‚Äôs real. It‚Äî""

Reynolds pulled out handcuffs. ""Let‚Äôs not make this difficult.""

Milo growled.

The room tilted.

Something shifted behind me. I felt the air grow heavy, the unseen presence curling around my neck like fingers ready to squeeze.

I tried one last time. ""Please. You have to listen to me.""

Reynolds just sighed. ""Yeah. I‚Äôve heard that one before.""

The psych ward smelled like antiseptic and old air conditioning. The walls were white. Too white. Like a place built to scrub the mind clean.

They took my phone. My camera. My notes.

They gave me a gray jumpsuit and a stiff bed in a room with no sharp edges. The window didn‚Äôt open. The door had a small slot for food trays.

I sat on the bed, staring at my bruised arms, at the way the darkness still lingered under my skin like fingerprints.

Maybe they were right. Maybe I had lost it.

But then‚Äî

A creak.

The air shifted.

I turned slowly.

The chair in the corner moved an inch.

A whisper slid along the walls, curling into my ear.

*""I told you. I see you.""*

1ii9hv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ii9hv3/the_late_night_text/,The Late Night Text,"I was about to go to bed when my phone buzzed.

A text from Olivia.

‚ÄúHey, can you come over?‚Äù

I frowned. Olivia was out of town. I knew that for a fact because I had dropped her off at the airport two days ago. We even joked about how her flight would probably be delayed, but she texted me when she landed. She was with her parents. Three states away.

I typed back: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you in Chicago?‚Äù

Three dots appeared. Then they vanished.

A few seconds later, another message came through.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for you inside.‚Äù

I felt my body go cold.

I stared at the screen, my fingers tightening around my phone. Maybe she left a key with someone. Maybe she came home early and forgot to tell me.

But then why did that message feel wrong?

I hesitated before replying. ‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù

No answer.

The room around me suddenly felt too quiet, like the air itself was listening.

I stood up, grabbed my keys, and left.

The drive to Olivia‚Äôs apartment was a blur. The streets were nearly empty, just the occasional car passing by, headlights flashing like warnings. My mind raced through possibilities. A prank? A break-in?

Or something worse?

When I pulled up to her building, everything looked normal. Too normal. Her window was dark. The parking lot empty.

I climbed the stairs, every step echoing in the silence. When I reached her door, I hesitated.

Then, I knocked.

The sound barely carried down the hallway.

No answer.

I knocked again, harder this time. ‚ÄúOlivia?‚Äù

Nothing.

I tried the handle, expecting it to be locked.

It wasn‚Äôt.

The door swung open with a slow, aching creak.

The apartment was dark. Stale. Like no one had been inside for days.

I stepped in, my pulse hammering against my ribs. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Silence.

Then‚Äî

A soft creak from the bedroom.

I froze.

Something shifted in the darkness beyond the hallway. A floorboard settling. A breath.

I reached for the light switch and flicked it on. The living room looked exactly as Olivia had left it. A blanket draped over the couch. A half-full glass of water on the coffee table. A pile of unopened mail near the door.

But the air felt wrong. Thick. Heavy.

Like I wasn‚Äôt alone.

Another creak. The bedroom door was cracked open just an inch, a sliver of darkness pressing against the dim hallway light.

My feet moved before I could think. I reached for the doorknob.

Then‚Äî

My phone buzzed.

The sound made me jump. I fumbled to pull it out of my pocket, my fingers numb.

A new message.

From Olivia.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go inside.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. My mouth went dry.

I wasn‚Äôt breathing. I wasn‚Äôt moving.

But I felt it.

A presence.

Right behind me.

And then‚Äî

The bedroom door creaked open wider.

I nearly dropped my phone. My heart was hammering so hard I could hear it in my ears.

The bedroom door creaked open wider, the darkness inside shifting. I braced myself, body locked in place, every instinct screaming at me to run.

Then‚Äî

A familiar shape stepped out.

A dog.

Olivia‚Äôs golden retriever, Milo.

Relief hit me so fast I almost laughed. My legs went weak, and I leaned against the wall, exhaling sharply. ‚ÄúJesus, Milo. You scared the hell out of me.‚Äù

Milo blinked up at me, tail wagging slightly, but something about him seemed‚Ä¶ off. His fur was matted in places, like he hadn‚Äôt been brushed in days. His paws left faint smudges on the hardwood, tracks of something I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. His eyes, usually warm and full of life, seemed darker. Duller.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get out?‚Äù I muttered, kneeling to scratch behind his ears. He felt cold. Too cold.

I glanced around the apartment again. Everything looked the same, but that feeling‚Äîlike something was watching me‚Äîhadn‚Äôt faded. If anything, it had settled deeper, like it had wrapped itself around the walls.

Milo whined softly, pressing his nose against my leg.

I looked down at him. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your leash?‚Äù

He just stared at me.

The air in the apartment was too still, like the whole place was holding its breath. I swallowed, shaking off the lingering unease. Maybe Olivia‚Äôs text was just a bad joke. Maybe she had asked someone to check on Milo, and they forgot to lock up.

Still, something gnawed at me.

I pulled out my phone, rereading the message:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go inside.‚Äù

I hesitated, then typed back: ‚ÄúVery funny. Milo just scared me half to death.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. Then they vanished.

I frowned. Olivia always texted fast.

Milo let out a soft whimper. His ears flattened, eyes flicking toward the bedroom.

I followed his gaze. The door was still open, revealing nothing but thick, suffocating darkness inside.

I hadn‚Äôt turned the bedroom light off.

Had I?

Milo took a step back, pressing against my leg.

The air suddenly felt colder.

I swallowed hard and forced out a laugh. ‚ÄúAlright, bud. Let‚Äôs get you outside.‚Äù

I grabbed his leash from the hook by the door, clipping it onto his collar with shaking hands. The second I opened the front door, Milo bolted, nearly yanking me off my feet.

I barely managed to keep hold of the leash as he dragged me down the hallway, his nails clicking frantically against the tile. His whole body trembled like he couldn‚Äôt get away fast enough.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

I locked the apartment behind me and followed Milo down the stairs, that last message from Olivia burning in my mind.

If Milo was inside‚Ä¶ who opened the bedroom door?

Milo didn‚Äôt stop pulling until we were outside, paws scuffing against the pavement as he dragged me toward the nearest patch of grass. He was shaking, ears flattened, tail tucked so tightly between his legs that it barely moved.

I knelt beside him, running my hands over his fur. His breathing was fast, his chest rising and falling in sharp, panicked bursts.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, buddy,‚Äù I murmured, though I wasn‚Äôt sure if I believed it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alright.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt look up. He just stared at the apartment building, eyes locked on my window.

I followed his gaze.

The bedroom light was back on.

I sucked in a breath, pulse hammering in my throat. I hadn‚Äôt touched the switch before leaving. Hadn‚Äôt even stepped inside the room.

Slowly, I reached for my phone.

‚ÄúOlivia. This isn‚Äôt funny. Is someone in your apartment?‚Äù

The message delivered instantly. No typing bubble appeared.

Milo let out a low whimper, pressing against my leg. I felt his whole body tense as if he was waiting for something.

I swallowed hard and looked back up at the window.

The light flickered.

Once.

Then, again.

Like someone was standing inside. Moving.

My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúOlivia, answer me.‚Äù

Three dots appeared. My fingers clenched around the phone.

Then the reply came.

# ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs with you?‚Äù

The words sent a sharp chill through me. I looked around, my breath fogging in the night air.

I was alone.

I stared at the message, confusion twisting into something colder.

# ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

Nothing. No response.

The window light flickered once more. Then it went out.

The apartment was dark again.

Milo let out a low growl.

Something about the night felt heavier, like the air had thickened, pressing in around me. I gripped his leash tighter, my free hand curling into a fist to stop the tremor in my fingers.

I needed to leave. I needed to turn around and walk away, call Olivia, and tell her to get her locks changed the second she got home.

But I couldn‚Äôt stop staring at that window.

Because the longer I looked‚Ä¶ the more I was sure‚Äî

Someone was still standing there. Watching.

Waiting.

Milo‚Äôs growl deepened, a low, rumbling warning that sent another chill up my spine. I wanted to look away from the window, to convince myself I was imagining things, but I couldn‚Äôt.

There was a shape in the darkness.

Not a reflection, not a shadow‚Äîsomething was standing inside Olivia‚Äôs apartment. It wasn‚Äôt moving, but I could feel it watching me.

I took a step back. Milo let out a sharp bark, yanking against the leash. The noise echoed down the quiet street, but nothing inside the apartment changed. The figure didn‚Äôt shift. Didn‚Äôt flinch. It just stood there.

My phone buzzed in my hand.

# ‚ÄúGet out of there.‚Äù

I barely had time to process the message before the light in her apartment flickered back on.

And the figure was gone.

My breath caught in my throat. My legs felt locked in place, every muscle screaming at me to move. I forced myself to look around‚Äîat the street, at the other buildings, at the empty parking lot. Everything else was completely normal.

Then my phone buzzed again.

# ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious. Don‚Äôt go back inside.‚Äù

I swallowed hard and typed with shaky fingers.

# ‚ÄúWho is in your apartment?‚Äù

The reply came instantly.

# ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my apartment.‚Äù

The cold inside my chest spread like ice water through my veins.

Not hers? I stared at the screen, rereading the words over and over. My pulse hammered in my ears, drowning out everything else.

I turned to Milo, who was still tense, ears pinned back. His body trembled under my hand. He was scared. More scared than I‚Äôd ever seen him.

That should have been enough.

That should have sent me running.

But instead, I found myself stepping forward, gripping my keys so tightly they bit into my palm.

I needed to know.

I needed to see.

Because if that wasn‚Äôt Olivia‚Äôs apartment‚Ä¶

Then whose was it?

And why did it know my name?

My feet felt heavy as I stepped toward the apartment door. Every instinct screamed at me to turn around, to listen to Olivia, to listen to Milo‚Äîwho was now whining, pulling at his leash in the opposite direction.

But I couldn‚Äôt leave. Not yet.

I reached out, my fingers grazing the doorknob. Cold. Too cold. Like it had been sitting in ice. My stomach twisted, but I forced myself to turn it. The door swung open with a slow creak.

The apartment was exactly as I had left it.

Lights on. Couch slightly askew. The kitchen counter still had my half-drunk coffee from earlier. Nothing out of place.

But it felt wrong.

The air was thick, heavy, pressing down on me like a weight. And it smelled different‚Äîstale, like the air hadn‚Äôt moved in years. My own apartment had never smelled like this.

Milo refused to come inside. He planted his paws firmly at the threshold, leash stretched tight, eyes locked on something I couldn‚Äôt see.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúMilo, come on.‚Äù

He whined again, taking a step back.

I sighed, unhooking his leash. ‚ÄúFine. Stay out here.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt hesitate. He bolted down the hallway, tail tucked.

I stared after him, unease curling in my chest. Milo had never run from anything before.

The door shut behind me with a soft click.

The sound made my breath catch. I hadn‚Äôt touched it.

I turned slowly, heart hammering.

The living room was empty.

I forced myself to breathe, to move. My phone buzzed in my pocket, but I ignored it. Instead, I walked toward the hallway leading to my bedroom‚Äîstep by step, my legs stiff, my body resisting.

I reached my door. It was slightly open. Had it been like that before?

I pushed it fully open.

My bed was made. My dresser untouched. The only thing out of place was my closet door.

It was open. Just a crack.

And something was breathing inside.

Shallow, raspy, like the air was being pulled through teeth.

I froze.

The sound didn‚Äôt stop.

Didn‚Äôt move.

Didn‚Äôt acknowledge me.

I reached for my phone, hands trembling, finally looking at the message Olivia had sent.

# ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go near the closet.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have time to react before the closet door creaked open another inch.

And something inside whispered*, ‚ÄúI told you not to come back.‚Äù*

The whisper curled through the air like smoke, seeping into my skin. My breath hitched, and I stepped back, my body screaming at me to run.

Then the closet door slammed open.

An icy gust shot through the room, knocking over a lamp and rattling the pictures on the wall. My phone slipped from my fingers, clattering to the floor. I tried to move, but something wrapped around my wrist‚Äîinvisible, cold, crushing.

I choked on a scream.

The pressure tightened, yanking me forward with a force that sent me stumbling toward the closet. My knees hit the ground hard. The room blurred around me as the grip spread, clawing up my arm, pressing into my skin like fingers of ice.

I struggled, kicking, twisting‚Äîbut there was nothing there. No hands. No body. Just a crushing, suffocating force that refused to let go.

Then, a voice‚Äîlow, guttural, right against my ear.

*""You let me in.""*

Pain lanced through my chest, cold and sharp, like something had reached inside me and gripped my ribs. My vision wavered. The walls around me flickered‚Äîmy bedroom, then darkness, then something else. A rotting hallway. A place that wasn't here.

No, no, no‚Äî

I thrashed, but the force only pulled harder. My body inched closer to the gaping darkness of the closet. The air inside it wasn‚Äôt just dark‚Äîit was wrong. It had depth, like an open mouth waiting to swallow me whole.

I was being dragged in.

A guttural snarl ripped through the air.

Milo.

He shot into the room, teeth bared, his growl deep and primal. He lunged, snapping at whatever had me.

The force let go.

I gasped as I collapsed backward, my body trembling. The air shifted‚Äîthe presence recoiling.

Milo barked, snapping at the darkness inside the closet. The second his teeth clicked shut, the closet door slammed shut on its own.

The room fell silent.

My hands were shaking as I crawled backward, gasping for breath. My wrist throbbed‚Äîwhen I looked down, dark bruises were already blooming, shaped like fingerprints.

Milo stood between me and the closet, still growling, his fur bristling.

I forced myself up, grabbed my phone, and ran.

I didn‚Äôt stop. Not when the lights flickered as I passed. Not when I heard something scraping against the walls. Not even when I felt the icy breath on the back of my neck as I reached the door.

I threw it open, nearly tripping over myself as I stumbled into the hallway.

Milo followed, and the door slammed shut behind us.

I stood there, panting, staring at the door. My apartment. My home.

And from inside, muffled but clear‚Äî

A whisper.

*‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over.‚Äù*

My hands were still shaking when I unlocked my phone. I barely registered the sweat slicking my fingers or the way my breath came in sharp, ragged gasps. All I knew was that I had to call for help.

I tapped 9-1-1.

The ringing felt like it stretched for hours before a voice finally clicked in.

""Nine-one-one, what‚Äôs your emergency?""

I swallowed hard. ""Please, you have to send someone. There‚Äôs‚Äîthere‚Äôs something in my apartment. It attacked me. It‚Äôs not human.""

A pause. Then, in the most patronizing voice I‚Äôd ever heard:

""Ma‚Äôam, are you in immediate danger?""

I looked at my wrist. The bruises were deepening, spreading up my forearm like ink soaking into paper. I licked my lips. ""Yes. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but it‚Äôs real. Please, just send someone!""

Another pause.

""Are you alone?""

I glanced down at Milo. His ears were still pinned back, his tail stiff. He hadn‚Äôt taken his eyes off the door.

""No,"" I said. ""My dog is with me.""

Another beat of silence. Then, with the kind of detached boredom that made my stomach drop, the dispatcher said, ""Ma‚Äôam, have you been drinking or taking any substances tonight?""

My stomach twisted.

""No! I told you, something attacked me! I have bruises‚Äî""

# FEB.5th, 2025~ China tightens grip on critical minerals

[China tightens grip on critical minerals - Metal Tech News](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/02/05/tech-metals/china-tightens-grip-on-critical-minerals/2127.html)

# Beijing adds five minerals critical to tech, energy, and defense to growing export restrictions list.

Continuing to exploit a weakness in the United States' economic and national security armor, China has placed restrictions on the exports of five additional critical minerals ‚Äì bismuth, indium, molybdenum, tellurium, and tungsten. All of these metals are essential to the high-tech, clean energy, and defense sectors of the U.S. economy.

Starting with gallium and germanium in mid-2023, China has been adding to a list of critical minerals that must receive state approvals before they are exported-providing the communist government the final say on where these commodities go and installing a mechanism for outright bans.

While the Chinese government has fallen short of saying its critical mineral restrictions are in retaliation to tariffs and bans on the exports of U.S. technology to China, instead citing the need to safeguard national security interests, each expansion of export restrictions has coincided with increased tariffs on Chinese goods from China or limitations on U.S. technologies to the communist nation.

As a result of the escalating trade war that began while Biden was president and continues into the Trump administration, Beijing has steadily increased the list of critical minerals that must receive government approval.

China's critical minerals export restrictions list now includes gallium and germanium used in semiconductors for computer chips; graphite needed for electric vehicle batteries; antimony needed for ammunition and fireproofing compounds; critical minerals processing technologies; and the five critical minerals restrictions that went into effect today.

In December, the Chinese government took more definitive and direct measures with a¬†[complete ban on the exports of antimony, gallium, and germanium to the U.S.](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/12/04/tech-metals/china-export-ban-deals-blow-to-us-economy/2052.html)

At the time, China's Ministry of Commerce said any individual or organization that ships gallium, germanium, antimony, or superhard materials that originated in China directly or indirectly to organizations or individuals in the U.S. ""will be held accountable according to law.""

These strict export restrictions come just one day after the Biden White House blacklisted an additional 140 Chinese-owned companies from receiving computer chipmaking equipment and related technologies, as well as high-bandwidth memory chips from the U.S.

The newest list of critical mineral export restrictions comes on the same day that 10% tariffs on all imports from China go into effect.

# Escalating supply chain risks for the U.S.

While China's latest salvo in an escalating trade war with the U.S. is seen by many geopolitical analysts as a measured response due to the relatively small market size of these critical minerals in comparison to the U.S. and China economies, significant reductions or outright bans on these minerals could have substantial impacts on sectors of the U.S. economy.

A report published by the U.S. Geology Survey (USGS) last November estimated that a complete Chinese ban on exports of gallium and germanium to the U.S. could¬†[send America's gross domestic product (GDP) plummeting by $3.4 billion.](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2024/12/04/tech-metals/china-export-ban-deals-blow-to-us-economy/2052.html)

The outsized economic impact is due to the importance of these critical minerals to varying sectors of the economy and the limited alternatives to China for them.

A more recent¬†[global minerals report published by the U.S. Geological Survey](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/02/05/tech-metals/us-critical-mineral-reliance-unchanged/2125.html)¬†shows that the U.S. depends on imports for 100% of its supply of 12 critical minerals and is more than 50% import-reliant for 28 of them.

According to the USGS report, China is the world's top producer of 30 of the minerals that have been deemed critical to the U.S., including antimony (60%), gallium (99%), graphite (80%), and rare earth elements (69%).

""We could be producing most of these minerals here at home-under world-leading environmental, labor and safety standards-yet China remains a massive threat to our supply chains and has boldly reminded the U.S. just how deep our dependence runs,"" National Mining Association Rich Nolan said, referring to China's late 2024 export restrictions on antimony, gallium and germanium, and tightening on exports of graphite to the U.S.

# Five restricted metals ‚Äì uses and impacts

The five new minerals added to China's growing export restrictions list are needed for manufacturing high-tech, clean energy, and military goods and technologies. Here is a rundown of the newly restricted critical minerals, China's control over global production, and their uses:

https://preview.redd.it/oksoqqegdbhe1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=388aee5e906a1b6ef65df8813839dc3fc7cde801

**Bismuth**¬†‚Äì China controls 81% of the global supply of bismuth, a mineral critical to a wide variety of cosmetic, pharmaceutical, automotive and metallurgical applications. Adding to the potential commercial uses of bismuth, U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories have made breakthroughs on powerful manganese-bismuth permanent magnets that could serve as an alternative to rare earth magnets in EV motors, wind turbines, military hardware, and high-tech devices.

**Indium**¬†‚Äì China produces 70% of the world's indium, a rare metal used as a transparent conducting film applied to virtually every smartphone and computer touchscreen on the market. Indium's low melting point is also leveraged to make solders used to bond non-metallic materials such as glass, glazed ceramics, and quartz. One of the biggest drivers of indium demand is lasers that lower the latency, reduce signal loss, and increase the speeds of 5G telecommunication networks.

**Molybdenum**¬†‚Äì China accounts for 42% of the global supply of molybdenum, a metal not currently on the U.S. critical minerals list due to domestic mining operations' ability to meet the nation's supply. Molybdenum is primarily used for to improve the strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance of steel and superalloys. This metal is also used in catalysts, lubricants, and pigments; for the manufacturing of electronics; in medicines; and as a micronutrient for agriculture.

**Tellurium**¬†‚Äì China controls roughly 77% of the global supply of tellurium, an extremely rare metalloid that lends its unique and extraordinary properties to the production of American-made cadmium telluride solar panels and thermoelectric generators that convert industrial waste heat into clean electricity. Tellurium thermoelectric generators are also being tested as a fuel-saving alternative to alternators in internal combustion vehicles. Additionally, this rare metalloid's unique properties could enhance solid-state batteries, potentially extending the range of EVs.

**Tungsten**¬†‚Äì China accounts for 83% of the global supply of tungsten, a superhard metal used in alloys for applications where resistance to high temperatures and extreme wear are essential. Roughly 60% of the tungsten consumed in the U.S. during 2024 was used to make cemented tungsten carbide, a compound nearly twice as strong as steel that is used in drill bits, wear plates, ammunition, and other items that require this compound's toughness. Tungsten toughness and heat-resistant properties are used for rocket engines, heating elements, and fusion reactors.

Aside from molybdenum, which the U.S. produces in abundance, China's growing grip on these and other critical minerals highlights the urgent need for domestic supply chain solutions. Without swift actions to develop domestic and allied alternatives, key industries may face disruptions.

# FEB. 5th, 2025~ Trump Needs a Plan on Ukraine‚Äôs Buried Treasure

[Trump Needs a Plan on Ukraine‚Äôs Buried Treasure - War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2025/02/trump-needs-a-plan-on-ukraines-buried-treasure/)

https://preview.redd.it/4jjgz2v4gbhe1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=02b8aea2f56eb25c8936f49a9e71b765fe67314d

**The Fight for Ukraine‚Äôs Buried Treasure**

Experts have offered a range of explanations for Putin‚Äôs full-scale invasion: from his ambitions to¬†[reconstruct the Soviet Empire](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/cold-war-putin-wants)¬†to¬†[concerns about NATO influence](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2021-12-28/what-putin-really-wants-ukraine?utm_source=PANTHEON_STRIPPED&check_logged_in=1)¬†in Ukraine to features of his¬†[post-pandemic psyche](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2022-03-18/dangers-putins-paranoia?utm_source=chatgpt.com). However, beneath these largely speculative narratives lie clear¬†[material](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/28/ukraine-war-russia-resources-energy-oil-gas-commodities-agriculture/)¬†[enticements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/10/ukraine-russia-energy-mineral-wealth/): the possible acquisition of Ukraine‚Äôs vast resources. Putin‚Äôs war of aggression has enabled Russia to gain control over nearly 20 percent of Ukraine‚Äôs territory, including significant reserves of minerals that Ukraine had hoped to leverage into a promising economic future.

Russia has been abetted in its theft by geography. A sizeable share of Ukraine‚Äôs mineral wealth is concentrated east of the Dnipro River. One¬†[estimate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/08/10/ukraine-russia-energy-mineral-wealth/)¬†holds that Russia has captured 33 percent of Ukraine‚Äôs critical raw materials deposits since 2014. A back-of-the-envelope calculation puts the value of this at $5‚Äì$8 trillion. Among Kyiv‚Äôs stolen assets are over 10 major mineral sites, including one of the lithium sites eyed by European Lithium and the massive rare earth metals deposit at Novopoltavske. Including stolen fossil fuel deposits, the value of Russian conquests currently exceed $12 trillion.

Preventing further loss of its territory and, by extension, its natural resources has been a central objective of Ukraine‚Äôs valiant self-defense. Fortunately, Ukraine still controls the bulk of its mineral reserves, including significant rare earth metals deposits in the Dnipropetrovsk region, along with¬†[major pockets](https://www.geo.gov.ua/wp-content/uploads/presentations/en/investment-opportunities-in-exploration-production-strategic-and-critical-minerals.pdf)¬†of graphite, titanium, cobalt, and manganese along the western bank of the Dnipro River.

Ukraine‚Äôs resource riches have also piqued interest within the corridors of Washington. For some American policymakers, Ukraine‚Äôs potential as a critical raw material partner presents a unique opportunity to diversify supply chains away from its geopolitical rivals. In the months before the full-scale war, Congress passed¬†[legislation](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title22/chapter96&edition=prelim#:~:text=27%2C%202021%2C%20135%20Stat.,States%20and%20Europe%20currently%20depend.)¬†mandating the State Department investigate the feasibility of utilizing titanium sources from Ukraine as a potential alternative to Chinese sources.

[America‚Äôs](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/us-energy-chief-concerned-about-chinas-critical-minerals-dominance.html)¬†[concerns](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-lawmakers-seek-address-chinas-dominance-critical-mineral-supply-chains-2024-06-18/)¬†about China‚Äôs dominance over critical materials are well-grounded. China¬†[controls](https://www-tandfonline-com.ezp.lib.cam.ac.uk/doi/pdf/10.1080/03932729.2024.2379980?needAccess=true)¬†85 percent of global rare earth refining, 95 percent of gallium production, and 67 percent of natural graphite mining, along with significant shares of cobalt and lithium refinement. China has also developed a firm hold on global titanium production, reaching¬†[66 percent in 2023](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf). By consolidating its access to these materials and their refinement, Beijing has established vertically integrated supply chains that power industries like semiconductors, batteries, and renewable energy. Moreover, China has deployed its control as a coercive tool against Washington, as evidenced by its¬†[December ban](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/china-minerals-semiconductors.html)¬†on exporting critical minerals like gallium, germanium, and graphite to the United States. This dominance presents strategic risks for the United States, potentially disrupting key sectors such as defense, technology, and clean energy.

Ukraine has deftly played off America‚Äôs concerns to position itself as a valuable partner in de-risking critical supply chains. As part of his ‚ÄúVictory Plan,‚Äù President Volodymyr Zelensky¬†[offered](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/plan-peremogi-skladayetsya-z-pyati-punktiv-i-troh-tayemnih-d-93857)¬†his Western backers ‚Äúa special agreement for the joint protection of the country‚Äôs critical resources, as well as joint investment and use of this economic potential.‚Äù This included a secret annex that likely included more detailed arrangements for Western investment and development opportunities. Ukrainian officials have also¬†[underlined](https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/haj-nasha-spilna-robota-za-planom-peremogi-yaknajshvidshe-ob-93849)¬†the risks to the United States should Moscow gain greater sway over these assets and seek to exploit them in partnership with Beijing.

Parts of the Republican foreign policy establishment have seized on this logic to push for greater support for Kyiv in the war.¬†[Speaking](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lindsey-graham-senator-south-carolina-face-the-nation-transcript-06-09-2024/)¬†in June, Sen. Lindsay Graham made the case bluntly:

They‚Äôre sitting on 10 to 12 trillion dollars of critical minerals in Ukraine. They could be the richest country in all of Europe. I don‚Äôt want to give that money and those assets to Putin to share with China. If we help Ukraine now, they can become the best business partner we ever dreamed of, that 10 to 12 trillion dollars of critical mineral assets could be used by Ukraine and the West, not given to Putin and China‚Ä¶ To give Putin 10 or 12 trillion dollars for critical minerals that he will share with China is ridiculous.

However, the issue of resource control is just beginning to filter into the mainstream strategic discourse. Trump‚Äôs¬†[recent comments](https://www.ft.com/content/94efcd8a-93ce-4ca6-bd07-061bfed1fdbf)¬†expressing interest in securing American access to Ukrainian rare earth metals dovetail with Kyiv‚Äôs strategy of offering development partnerships in exchange for enhanced military and diplomatic support. The president‚Äôs statement is one step in the right direction insofar as it acknowledges the material stakes of the conflict. However, it should be noted that Ukraine‚Äôs resource wealth extends far beyond just rare earth metals.

As the fight for Ukraine‚Äôs underground riches drags on, the Trump administration would do well to consider the risks and opportunities presented by a cessation of hostilities. Failure to integrate resource calculations into Western strategy could have profound strategic consequences, entrenching rival states‚Äô control over the inputs for economic dynamism and depriving the West of an invaluable partner in achieving greater technological and manufacturing self-sufficiency.

**Policies for Peace**

To secure the foundations of Western economic power, the new administration should devise a policy framework that allows for capitalization of and cooperation over Ukraine‚Äôs critical raw material reserves. The two essential features of such a strategy are institutional links to facilitate and secure rapid Western investment in the mineral extraction sector and a credible deterrent against future Russian aggression. Such a framework should also draw on the support and resources of interested partners in the European Union.

On the investment side, the United States could spearhead the creation of a U.S.‚ÄìE.U.‚ÄìUkrainian investment consortium designed to attract and mobilize capital for Ukraine‚Äôs mining sector. By providing government-backed funds to de-risk investments and offering tax incentives to Western companies, this initiative could facilitate the rapid development of strategic resources like lithium, graphite, titanium, and rare earth metals. Alongside this, Washington should work with Kyiv to establish a mineral export control framework and investment screening processes that privilege Western access and prevent Chinese penetration. These transparency mechanisms and joint ventures between Ukrainian and Western entities are essential to ensuring that investment flows are secure, strategic, and free from malign external influence.

To complement these measures, the United States could spearhead infrastructure development financing ‚Äî focusing on rebuilding rail and port infrastructure; expanding power generation and transmission; and constructing the refineries, smelters, and storage facilities necessary for mining operations. Standing up special economic zones in resource-rich regions along the Dnipro could streamline investment processes by providing favorable regulations, investment guarantees, and incentives for technology transfer. Finally, the United States and European Union should back an anti-corruption program tailored to the mining sector to enhance investor confidence and ensure responsible resource management. By fostering public‚Äìprivate collaboration and integrating Ukraine into Western supply chains through long-term trade agreements, these policies will enable Ukraine to leverage its mineral wealth for national recovery while securing a stronger Western geoeconomic position.

However, since Ukraine remains a high-risk jurisdiction for investment, any credible plan for stimulating private sector engagement will require clear and robust mechanisms to ensure Ukraine‚Äôs future security and protect new capital. The specter of another Russian attack following a period of rearmament will loom large over any investment calculations in New York, London, or Brussels. While formal NATO admission seems unlikely, the United States could throw its support behind a range of other multilateral frameworks in service of deterring Russia.

For example, the U.K.-led¬†[Joint Expeditionary Force](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10074/), a multinational military partnership with the Nordic and Baltic states, could provide the institutional and operational scaffolding necessary to integrate Kyiv into Europe‚Äôs security architecture. The Joint Expeditionary Force could leverage real political clout and a large pool of high-readiness forces to provide Ukraine with initial guarantees while NATO allies coordinate on mechanisms to reinforce deterrence over the long term. For its part, the United States could encourage deeper Polish involvement with the Joint Expeditionary Force as a means of providing the group with a sizeable land force to ensure stability along a demilitarized line in eastern Ukraine, while also offering temporary support in the form of airlift as well as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities to bridge operational gaps until European states develop sufficient indigenous capacities. This is one, but by no means the only, possible option for achieving the kind of robust security guarantees necessary to promote and protect future investment in Ukraine‚Äôs critical materials sector.

In any event, Washington should also increase its provision of advanced missile defense and anti-air systems to Kyiv. Such systems will be instrumental in protecting critical infrastructure from future assaults and instilling a degree of security within the Ukrainian public. Tactical support should also be complemented by clear strategic deterrence signals from Washington. The United States should make it clear to the Kremlin that future aggression will be met by coordinated military action from Western partners.

Unlocking Ukraine‚Äôs massive untapped mineral wealth represents an opportunity to both secure Kyiv‚Äôs long-term economic prospects and insulate critical Western supply chains during a period of heightened geoeconomic and geopolitical tensions. Such an effort will require sustained engagement from Washington and its partners in Europe. It would also not be without risks or challenges. However, the new administration should carefully consider the opportunities presented and build a diplomatic and military strategy that allows the West to benefit from this providential natural endowment.

*U.S. Urged to Accelerate Production of its Own Critical Minerals and Reduce its Dependence on China, Russia, and other Adversarial Nations*

CENTENNIAL, Colo. (February 4, 2025) ‚Äì The People‚Äôs Republic of China is ratcheting up efforts to deny the U.S. and its allies access to critical minerals that are essential to national defense and many commercial technologies, according to Mark Smith, Executive Chairman and CEO of NioCorp Developments Ltd. (‚Äú**NioCorp**‚Äù or the ‚Äú**Company**‚Äù) (**NASDAQ:NB**).

According to the Feb. 4, 2025 Wall Street Journal, China implemented export restrictions of five additional critical minerals:¬† tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, and indium ([https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-us-trade-stock-market-02-04-2025/card/china-restricts-exports-of-critical-minerals-in-retaliatory-move-e8omEEQJLU911Z1jt4gT](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-tariffs-us-trade-stock-market-02-04-2025/card/china-restricts-exports-of-critical-minerals-in-retaliatory-move-e8omEEQJLU911Z1jt4gT)).¬† In December 2024, China¬†[**banned the export**](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-exports-gallium-germanium-antimony-us-2024-12-03/)¬†of gallium and germanium, which are vital to many electronics and defense applications, and increased export restrictions on graphene.

All of these minerals have applications in various defense and commercial technologies, but export blocks on other critical minerals cause much more damage to the Pentagon, according to Smith.

‚ÄúWith today‚Äôs move, China is showing that it will not hesitate to deny the U.S. access to other critical minerals that are much more vital,‚Äù Smith said.¬† ‚ÄúIf they start restricting U.S. access to rare earths, for example, as they did for a brief time in 2010, we are in serious trouble.‚Äù

In another move aimed squarely at the Pentagon, China‚Äôs Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) announced on January 1, 2025 the addition of 28 U.S. defense-sector companies to its Export Control List.¬† That means that these companies, which include Raytheon, General Dynamics, Boeing, and others, may not import from China ‚Äúdual use‚Äù goods and technologies that can be used in both commercial and defense systems.

NioCorp and GreenMet ([https://greenmet.com/](https://greenmet.com/)) recently issued a warning to U.S. policymakers and manufacturers of coming export restrictions on defense-critical minerals:¬†[https://dailycaller.com/2025/01/31/smith-horn-china-missile-aimed-pentagon-xi-jinping/](https://dailycaller.com/2025/01/31/smith-horn-china-missile-aimed-pentagon-xi-jinping/)

We have been long distance for about a year now after I moved from our shared hometown. Our relationship before we were long-distance was eventful and intense, yet we have enjoyed our time together greatly. I feel like we bring out good things in each other and I consider her my best friend. I have a history of alcohol abuse and have been to rehab and have abstained successfully for about 3 years. We also both deal with pretty substantial emotional trauma and recently shared a positive breakthrough between us just two weeks ago before this. Her last relationship ended tragically and I feel like we have helped each other work through a lot.

On Saturday night, she went to the hospital after blacking out while clubbing with friends. I found out by looking at her location before bed (bc she hadn‚Äôt texted back) and seeing her there. I played detective from 600 miles away to figure out who she was with, then had to get her friends to unlock her phone and call her mom. Her parents wouldntve known where she was or what happened and she would‚Äôve woken up in the ER very confused if I had not intervened. Her friends thought she was drugged because it happened so fast, but her CT scan and tox report were clear, which made me sus. The morning after, she confessed to me that her friends told her she kissed two people (while blackout) who I kind of know but not really. After two days of breakdowns, I called her last night and after a night of no sleep, the regret is hitting.

Because my sobriety is non-negotiable and in an effort to avoid any further hurt/toxicity for both of us, I felt I had to do it sooner than later. Told her she can reach out if she feels like it‚Äôs absolutely necessary but we are broken up and no-contact for the foreseeable future. She‚Äôs gonna talk to her therapist about whether or not we should get coffee when I come visit next week. Turns out the hotel she booked us for valentines is non-refundable but hey at least my presents are.

He‚Äôs older, confident, and honestly everything I‚Äôm into. Every time he spoke, I felt drawn to him‚Äîlike there was something unspoken between us. So today, I finally did it. I waited until after class, walked up to him, and asked if he wanted to grab coffee sometime.

He smiled‚Äîpolite, almost apologetic. And then he said it. *‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really sweet, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm married.‚Äù*

I felt my face burn instantly. I laughed it off, pretending it didn‚Äôt bother me, but as soon as I got to the bathroom, I broke down. Not just because he turned me down, but because I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. And the weirdest part? Knowing he has a wife doesn‚Äôt make me want him any less. If anything, it makes things‚Ä¶ more exciting?

So, is this a dead end, or is there still a chance? Would it be crazy to try again?

As an expat in Japan, I've met and gotten to know Japanese and foreigners over the years on various occasions, with them mentioning loneliness and a lack of meaningful connections and looking for friends in this country. We usually had a great time when we hung out for the first time, with them sharing their stories or lives enthusiastically. I did the soft invite (we should grab a beer/coffee or do something [within their interest/hobby] together sometimes) and they said ""yes, sure"" and exchanged contact when we were parting ways. However, when I asked about their weekend plans afterward they almost always said ""I don't know"" or ""I have no plans"", keeping the response short and shutting off potential following-up hangouts. Such situations where people actively shut down an opportunity to make connections were much less frequent outside Japan.


Considering the culture of Japan where solitude was considered the norm, it makes me start wondering if a society where most people are just role-playing social obligations with few of them comfortable being themselves, and the lack of circumstances, especially in busy megacities can be the main hindrance of making friends, even if someone is socially adapted and more open in other countries.",1,1738759927.0,socialskills,6,1.0,False

Information about me
34(F)
150lb
Height 4'11""
Not a smoker (former yes) 
History of myocarditis
Recent C Section (6 months ago) 
Developed pre eclampsia with severe symptoms AFTER c section. Liver enzymes high. Went on mag drip and put on BP meds afterwards 
While in ER for pre eclampsia diagnosis, Dr decided to do a neck CT and found a vertebral artery dissection as well. 
Medications I'm currently on. (Amlodopine 10mg, aspirin 325mg, plavix 75mg all daily) 

For note - I do have an appt scheduled next Tuesday with a NP to do a physical is what the receptionist offered when I called. 

I have previously after my c section seen a doctor for a weird pain on the left side of my abdomen. It was pain brushing against abdomen not really deep inside. But did start hurting inside too after a while. And eventually went away. He did an x ray which only showed mild/moderate fecal load. The Dr said it seemed to be moving through and to increase fiber and water intake. 

Symptoms now - Recently in the past few months since I've seen that doctor I have been getting what I think is constipated. One day when I went to the bathroom I bled so much, but it also felt like stabbing knives when I was pooping. I messaged the Dr. He said probably anal fissure and they would call me to make an appt but it would be about 3 weeks. Blood was never IN the stool as far as I'm aware. Always just streaking the outside. Could it look like worse bleeding because I'm on anti platelets and aspirin? I did all I could, taking stool softeners so it wouldn't hurt when I went to the bathroom. It took about a week for the bleeding to stop completely and it never bled if my stool was soft and came out easily. The next month around my period it seemed to happen again. Constipated and blood on stool. Went away. This past month on period, no bleeding but haven't been as constipated. I did start taking stool softeners and miralax as soon as my period came. (My periods are like a crime scene btw on these blood thinners sheesh) I don't take the aspirin and plavix religiously because I'm scared it's contributing to the bleeding. 
I don't feel like I'm being emptied out all the way. My lower back now hurts pretty bad. Although, I'm not that active. And my actual butthole is in discomfort. It feels like something wants to push out of it but nothing will. I don't think constipation is new for me. Usually to poop, I have to drink coffee and if I don't drink any that day I probably won't poop. It's just things I've noticed in the past. 
My stomach does gurgle a good bit lately too it seems. Oh and after my c section I struggled with gas pretty bad. I would have gas all day that was pretty stinky. 
Soo am I just backed up and crazy? I say crazy because maybe I've scared myself into not pooping because I'm scared I'll see blood. 
Hoping the NP i see on Tuesday will refer me for more tests and I'll get more answers. Anything I should ask specifically or any advice from some GI docs? 
Any suggestions? I'm scared to do an enema because of what I read on Google. And I'm scared of mixing things with my medications?

We arrived during a very large corporate gathering but the resort didn‚Äôt feel crowded at all. In retrospect, the resort clearly planned for the increased number of people and we had great/timely service while we were there concurrently. I say that because the shift in staffing was noticeable following the end of the corporate event. On multiple occasions we had to either wait for pool towels because the kiosk was not stocked, or I just had to go behind the kiosk and grab towels after waiting a considerable amount of time because the kiosk was unstaffed. Our reservation was for 5 nights and while we didn‚Äôt request room cleaning/linen changes every day, on more than one occasion the request for room service sat unanswered until the next day. 

Room

Preferred Club Swim-Out King - After our ocean front swim out in Cancun last year (Secrets Riviera Maya) I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever NOT splurge for a swim-out room. The room itself looked very similar to our Cancun swim-out with the added features of bluetooth speakers built in to the ceiling, a nice touch for sure. Our mini fridge was restocked daily and the nightly turn down service ensured we had plenty of bottled water on our nightstands and the bathroom counter, presumably for brushing your teeth. Also to note, I used the bottled water to brush my teeth and rinse my tooth brush while my wife used the tap water; neither of us had any issues. The double rain shower was also a nice touch with neither of us having any issues with a lack of hot water. I think we both preferred Secrets Tides swim-out design over the design at Secrets Riviera Maya. From what I saw (at least in the preferred section) is that the rooms were staggered such that only two rooms and swim-outs were grouped together; meaning the swim-out would only be shared with one other room. In our case, we lucked out as the couple in the room next to us checked out the day we arrived and we had the entire area to ourselves the duration of our stay.

Food

Meraki (Mediterranean/Asian Fusion) - We sat for hours. Literal hours. The food was good, but the experience was ruined by having waited over an hour for our food to come out. Which for some reason was appetizer and entree at the same time. Noting that this was after the large corporate gather had departed.

Tierra (South American Fusion) - I think had we ordered different menu items we would have enjoyed this better. Both my wife‚Äôs fish and my red snapper were on the dry side, but the flavor was incredible. Quick service and a note that our visit to this restaurant occurred when the corporate gather was still happening, so perhaps staffing was at a higher level. I think my wife would agree that this was our favorite restaurant.

Oceana (Preferred Club - Seafood) - We tried this for both breakfast one day and lunch another. Breakfast was pretty standard and nothing out of the ordinary. Slightly more variety than the buffet breakfast but considering the amount of time we waited for service/food we‚Äôd choose the buffet if time is of the essence. Lunch was a much better experience. My wife and I both got the Dominican special and loved it. Much quicker service.

Portofino (Italian) - The ‚Äúfine dining‚Äù restaurant. Quick service and solid food options. My wife made her own pasta and seemed to enjoy it, thought she did mention it was a little salty. I had the Ossobucco and also enjoyed it. Moist, flavorful, and a good size portion. 

Seaside Grill (Grilled Meat/Seafood) - I‚Äôm a sucker for picanha and devoured my entree with no shame, tasted very similar to Texas de Brazil‚Äôs picanha cut. My wife‚Äôs t-bone was flavorful, moist, and cooked as requested. Looking back at our not so great experience with some of the other restaurants, I‚Äôd choose this over Meraki and Oceana (Seaside is also open for lunch).

Market Caf√© (Buffet) - Quite impressed by the buffet, both by quality and quantity of available items. I know most people say to stay away from the buffet but we found the experience the same, in not better than the restaurants. The breakfast choices were limited, but our only other option was Oceana which you just read about. Lunch and Dinner is where this buffet shines. We ate two lunches and a dinner there and could not have been happier. Picanha was available the first lunch, prime rib the next. Never crowded and we appreciated the ability to eat as quickly or slowly as we wanted after our experiences at Meraki and Oceana.

Coco Caf√© - 24 hour coffee shop that also has quick bites; sandwiches, wraps, desserts, etc. We went pretty much every day, typically in the afternoon/evening and there wasn‚Äôt ever a long wait or line. Coffee drinks come out quick and unlike last year I didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúthe itis‚Äù after having an iced coffee.

Preferred Club Lounges - Based on our experience at Secrets in Cancun, we found this lounge incredibly lacking. The same or fewer selections available at Coco Caf√©. Very minimal stock and typically limited to small bite size dessert items.

**Also want to note that the menus displayed within the Hyatt Inclusive App/Sunbox.app website differed (sometimes dramatically) from the actual menus we were handed when dining.

In Room Dining - We did in-room breakfast on the day of our departure and it was about as expected. Eggs, hash browns, meat. I will note that this was delivered at the requested time to the minute. We also ordered in-room lunch one day and thoroughly enjoyed it. Burger, buffalo wings, fries. No complaints at all.

Beach/Activites

We took advantage of a handful of resort activities this visit. Hat painting, doll painting, painting on the beach, jewelry making. We found the events fun and gave us an opportunity to meet and chat with other guests. The event‚Äôs weren‚Äôt overcrowded and we genuinely enjoyed them. 

Since we had our own swim-out we didn‚Äôt spend a whole lot of time on the beach, but we did walk the beach in the morning and evening a number of times. When we did venture to the preferred beach, we had no issue finding chairs, beds, etc.",4,1738759875.0,PuntaCana,2,1.0,False

 Go local!"" And trust me, I get it. I love those tiny, hole-in-the-wall cafes with the strong espresso and the pastel de nata.


But here's the thing: sometimes, you just want that familiar taste, that Pumpkin Spice Latte in the middle of summer (yes, they have it here!). And honestly, the Starbucks here isn't quite the same as back home.


 * The Vibe: Maybe it's the Portuguese sunshine, but the baristas here seem extra friendly. They're patient with my terrible Portuguese, and they always have a smile.


 * The Menu: They've got some unique stuff I haven't seen elsewhere. Think local pastries alongside your Frappuccino. It's a fun mix.


 * The Locations: They're popping up in some cool spots. I grabbed a coffee with a view of the Douro River in Porto, and it was pretty epic.
Look, I'm not saying ditch the local cafes. But if you're craving a taste of home or just need a reliable Wi-Fi spot, Starbucks in Portugal is a solid option. And who knows, you might even find a new favorite drink!",1,1738759299.0,Loveportugal,0,1.0,False

have you met these people? These self-proclaimed expats. (which is just a fancy word for immigrant who thinks they‚Äôre better than other immigrants) who have lived in Berlin for a decade and still can‚Äôt order a coffee in German? Ten years! You could‚Äôve become a doctor in that time. But instead, you‚Äôre standing in a bakery, blinking at the cashier like a malfunctioning Roomba, just hoping they take pity on your dumbass and switch to English.

And then you ask them why they don‚Äôt learn German, and they get defensive. ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs so hard!‚Äù Oh, is it? Oh, I‚Äôm sorry, did words hurt you? You‚Äôre telling me you can navigate three different VPNs just to watch HBO Max from the States. You people have mastered the rules of polyamory, crypto investing, and filing freelance taxes under seven different fake addresses, but the moment you see a der, die, das, your brain just blue screens?

And don‚Äôt get me started on the ones who insist they are learning. ‚ÄúOh yeah, I totally know German! Eins, zwei, drei, danke sch√∂n!‚Äù Wow. Wow. Look at you, Duolingo graduate of the year.

And the worst part? These people act like they‚Äôre the victims. ‚ÄúOh, Germans are so cold to me!‚Äù Yeah, buddy, that‚Äôs because you‚Äôve been here for a decade and still talk to them like a backpacker who just landed at Tegel in 2012. You‚Äôre basically a tourist with a lease.

And let‚Äôs not pretend it‚Äôs about intelligence. No, these same people will have very deep thoughts about Hegel and Nietzsche at some underground bar while ordering in English from a bartender named Klaus who‚Äôs just nodding along like he‚Äôs considering throwing himself into the Spree.

But they won‚Äôt even attempt a basic sentence in German. It‚Äôs like they expect the entire country to just absorb their culture, while they keep living in this little English-speaking bubble, hanging out only with other expats and never even trying to integrate. You‚Äôre not an expat at this point. You‚Äôre a guest who overstayed their welcome and keeps asking if the WiFi is down.

And they love to pretend they‚Äôre trying. ‚ÄúOh yeah, I totally understand German, I just don‚Äôt speak it.‚Äù Oh, do you? Then why do you look like a scared golden retriever every time a German speaks at normal speed? These people have been surrounded by the language for years, but still talk like a stroke victim reading Google Translate.

Look, I get it. Learning a new language is hard. But so is getting yelled at by an old lady at the B√ºrgeramt for filling out the wrong form because you refuse to learn any words beyond ‚ÄúSchwarzbier‚Äù and ‚ÄúKartoffelsalat.‚Äù So just make an effort. A tiny effort. Say one sentence in German a day. Even if it‚Äôs wrong. Germans respect effort. They‚Äôll still judge you, but at least they‚Äôll judge you less. And isn‚Äôt that all we really want in life?

Sincerely, a brown immigrant.

Am I  insane?,"We have been living together for over 8 months now and have known each other for about a year. Things have been escalating to the point where I tried to wake her up at 4pm, we both had a late night and decided to sleep late. 

She woke up seemed extremely pissed off, went out started cleaning the house and yelled at me to ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù

Me :- ‚Äúwhat happened? Let me clean up maybe..?‚Äù 

Her:- ‚ÄúNo fuck off T, this is what you want me to do isn‚Äôt it? That‚Äôs why you woke me up?‚Äù 

Me:- ‚ÄúNo I wanted us to get up and have coffee ‚Äú 

Her:- ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want your coffee, I‚Äôll clean up YOUR room and YOUR bed. You can shower and enjoy your day I am so sorry I am such a burden and I am not good enough for you‚Äù 

I am lost for words this has never been this bad, for context my gf has huge mood swings and anger issues. We could be utterly betwixt with good moods the day before and she‚Äôd be absolutely pissed off the next day‚Ä¶ I know that she‚Äôs been having a rough month since we have to pay off a few credit cards but things were not that bad. 

Something that bothers her is if I ever even say let us pay it off for now and you don‚Äôt have to stress over finding a job right now. (She‚Äôs been unemployed for a few months now but she does do part time jobs and gigs). This would set her off into this huge anger swing of saying that she doesn‚Äôt need my money and she should go back home cuz I am such an arrogant person. 

I have never shown any arrogance towards her but she picks up that I have and that I display it but obviously I don‚Äôt realize it. I asked her for like an example of that and she says you do all the time but would not ever point a moment. She says I always offer to pay for stuff or order stuff for her and that‚Äôs so I can quench my ego. 

I DO NOT.. I am getting emotional but I am very sad cuz after our row today she said she will sleep in the other room and I can live my life without having her as a burden. The only reason I offer to do things for her is so she doesn‚Äôt get stressed and have an outburst of anger. 

She realizes she has these bouts of wanton outrage and is cognizant of that. I love her and I hate for us to break up over nothing 

These fights have been escalating every month and only get worse I‚Äôm terrified to do anything. I‚Äôm anxious all the time. I break down and cry when she‚Äôs not around because if I do next to her she sometimes get annoyed and say I‚Äôm self victimizing. 

We have an appointment for a psychiatrist on the 11th of February I really just want us to make it to that and then maybe we can try to repair our relationship slowly. 

Whenever anything is going wrong it somehow becomes my fault in some manner. We have a cat and he meows at night and keeps us up sometimes which makes her pissed off that I keep her up at night and he keeps her up in the morning. 

I asked her to put her phone down and get sleep at night which made her wake up and force me to watch a tv series till she was satisfied that I‚Äôd fall asleep. 

I have no problem with her like sleeping but of course this is like me being selfish cuz I sleep when she doesn‚Äôt sometimes. 

We woke up at 4pm today, we went to bed around 4. I woke up to throw the garbage around 7:30 which is when the garbage collection comes around and I asked her to stay in bed and let me do it she woke up of her own volition to help me. 

We went back to bed around 9-10am and woke up around 4pm. I did wake her up since she told that she‚Äôd like to get up early to go out and catch some sunlight. Then she wakes up and this happens.. she also told me that she couldn‚Äôt sleep at night cuz of me when the only thing I did was ask her to not scroll cuz it will keep her up all night. And then our cat apparently kept her up in the morning so both of us don‚Äôt let her get sleep. She then said she wants to go back home to her parents cuz this environment is not good for her. 


I love her with all my being, and I want her to bd happy not feel so shit. Am I insane for trying to wake her up? If I try to be supportive so she can  get to do the things she told me she‚Äôd like to do and then it turns into you want me to do that cuz I‚Äôm not good enough for you.. I don‚Äôt even ask her to find work cuz this happens I told her she has all the time to figure out what she wants to do in life.

I‚Äôm holding on hoping that the psych visit will prove fruitful to help her through her anger issues‚Ä¶ ",5,1738758435.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

kiana2015 ¬∑¬†Today 00:10

My DP has a DS with his Ex, let's call her Claire. Claire works and also receives benefits, she rents a house and gets all of her rent paid by universal credit as well as the local council paying the top up amount. Claire also receives child maintenance. I have worked out Claire makes more than me or my partner. Claire buys herself new clothes every single month, gets her hair and nails done and goes out for coffee 4-5 times a week. Every month for the past 8 months, Claire has messaged my partner to say she has no money for their DS food. Obviously I would never see their DS or even her go without food but if it was me or any respectable person, would t it be wise to budget like a normal person, if you can't afford FOOD which is a basic necessity then cut out all of your own 'fun stuff' sorry not even looking for opinions more just a rant as it's really grating me. Claire also stops us going on fun family days out as she states she can't afford to do this so it's not fair we should, which in turn causes DS to miss out, if it was my child I would want them to have fun and experiences.¬†

Do you have dcs? I may have missed something.

OP posted a couple of days ago. She has a 9 month old and wants another baby ASAP. They can afford it, she says. But they begrudge properly funding the child from Family Number 1.

Does your stepson have his own room OP?



**BookmarkJandamiHash ¬∑¬†Today 01:21**

I‚Äôve doffed my deerstalker and have AS the OP as I just think this thread feels a bit off

Her husband also has a DD from a previous relationship he‚Äôs only just started seeing again. They live in a 2 bed flat and plan to have another baby who will share a room with their current child. I wonder where the 2 SC sleep when they come over.

OP also has posted about her OH going on days out alone with his kids and his ex and leaving her (OP) out and her OH taking phone calls from his ex in another room

OP - you have a DP problem not an ex wife problem. Do not have a 2nd baby with this man

Today I begin a slow, deliberate detox from coffee

I normally drink 4 cups of Paul Newmans Own Organics every day. Once in a while I've had 5 cups. 

Today is 3 maximum.  

According to the nutritional information there is 150mg of caffeine per serving. (I drink a large from my Keurig machine each serving).

So I've been drinking 600mg a day!

I'm in year 3 of retirement (I'll be 61 in June)

I used to drink 6-8 cups a day. 

Then I would pound down a 6 pack of beer after work/at night!

Today is day 100 no alcohol. 

I also started hard-core keto diet on January 1st. 

IM GOING TO DO THIS

My first goal is to get to ONE small cup of coffee a day. 

After that I will re-evaluate and consider 100% caffeine free.
