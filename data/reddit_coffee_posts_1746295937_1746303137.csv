Last sunday I was taking a proctored exam and halfway through began to feel a little nauseous, at first i thought it was due to the coffee i had in the morning or my adhd medication making my heart rate spike. however, my main symptom was that I felt unable to swallow without significant difficulty and focus and a few times i had to grip the table in a panic when i swallowed my saliva because it was so difficult. I got out of the exam and the symptoms went away with some water.

the next day on the way to work, i began to feel motion sick on the bus ride. i had the exact same sensation of not being able to swallow without difficulty which caused my anxiety to rise because of fear that maybe i was going to throw up. all of this spirals into a silent anxiety freakout on an hour long bus ride but once I get to work I‚Äôm fine and have little issue on the way home. However, on tuesday i have the same sensation on the bus ride and then begin to have this issue while eating my lunch at work. I am unable to swallow my food and have to spit it out immediately, it‚Äôs like my ability to swallow naturally disappears and my body doesn‚Äôt know what to do with foreign objects. I immediately spit the food out, feel nauseous and panicked for the rest of the day. I decided that there must be something wrong so i took 2 days off work where i had some symptoms similar but they were coming and going and not as severe.

Friday, I managed to not feel carsick on the bus in the morning however, while at work I felt extremely awful where I could not even open my lunch box without the feeling of my throat tightening and nausea and anxiety levels rising. my heart rate was around 100 while sitting down at the lunch table. I tried to eat a cracker and felt it get stuck a little in my throat when trying to swallow which rejected it. Once i got back to my desk, I drank some water which required significant difficulty. I had to grip the desk or would even do full body shudders when trying to swallow even my own saliva. on the bus ride home, I felt that I could not breathe properly due to this tight feeling in the throat and kept trying to cough to get rid of it with no success. Once home, it took me over an hour to eat my dinner of fried rice due to this blocking of my throat and extreme panicked feeling. I managed to fall asleep but woke up in an extreme panic as i kept having the sensation that I need to swallow. I followed a youtube breathing exercise video to hopefully calm me down as I was anxious and crying due to this sensation that felt like it was overtaking me.

Today, I had coffee and was able to drink it not a  problem but the feeling came back strong again during lunchtime and I was unable to finish my food. Drinking water is now risky as it results in the full body jolt I was experiencing prior and I feel like i cannot eat normally again and have had multiple panic attacks about this experience that has impacted my life severely the past week.

Voters will be asked to consider adopting a local meals tax, buying a new fire truck for $850,000 and approving a $5.29 million budget for fiscal year 2026 at Annual Town Meeting on Tuesday, May 6.


The meeting will start at 6 p.m. at Colrain Central School, 22 Jacksonville Road. Colrain residents will be asked to weigh in on the 25 articles on the warrant.


Article 19 seeks approval to buy a $850,000 fire truck. Fire Chief Nicholas Anzuoni said the department plans to replace its 2001 KME 1250 with something newer and a little bigger.


‚ÄúWhen we bought it, it had a cabin for two people, and we‚Äôre trying to get a custom engine with a cabin that can fit up to six people,‚Äù Anzuoni said.


Anzouni said the current truck has 25 years of road salt and other wear and tear, and has required frequent repairs. The new truck would be stainless steel and weather-resistant, and would allow firefighters to have more space while riding in the truck. The current truck‚Äôs cabin is tight and doesn‚Äôt leave much space for gear like air tanks.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôll help us in keeping with our mission in protecting the town and keeping our guys safe while doing so,‚Äù Anzouni said.


During a review of the warrant last week, Town Administrator Diana Parsons said if voters agree, the town will pay for the fire truck using its free cash and stabilization funds. According to the state Department of Revenue, Colrain has $439,763 in certified free cash for FY25. If the town transfers $20,000 to the General Stabilization Account and $40,000 to the Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) Fund as proposed in Articles 14 and 15, the town would be left with $377,000 to buy the truck.


‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only making three transfers out of free cash ‚Äî one of them is for the fire truck,‚Äù Parsons said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre using most of the free cash for the fire truck and I want to leave a little for general stabilization. You always want to leave a little on the table in case things go awry next year.‚Äù


Articles 4 to 13 break down the town‚Äôs proposed $5.29 million budget, which is a nearly 8% increase from FY25. For FY26, the town is proposing $530,696 for general government, $346,972 for public safety, $866,931 for public works, $46,397 for human services, $115,470 for culture and recreation, $2,050 for debt payments, $12,976 for its Franklin Regional Council of Governments assessment, and $416,596 for insurance and retirement benefits.


The town‚Äôs assessment for the Mohawk Trail Regional School District will be nearly $2.59 million and the assessment for Franklin County Technical School will be $357,201.


Parsons said the town is in good financial standing and the budget reflects that.


‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got [roughly $500,000] sitting in general stabilization, half a million in highway stabilization, almost a million in Chapter 90,‚Äù Parsons said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in a very, very strong position. You have plenty of levy capacity. ‚Ä¶ As much as the budget looks substantially bigger, you‚Äôre in a great financial spot.‚Äù


The town is also looking to increase its available funding by asking voters to adopt a local meals tax in Article 25. The state imposes a 6.25% tax on prepared meals and allows municipalities to adopt an optional 0.75% tax that would raise the total rate to 7%. Parsons said it is a small sum, but over time the funding could build up to be a good amount that could help fund roadwork and other town projects.


‚ÄúI am asking the town to consider this. It ends up being like $0.05 on a $5 coffee,‚Äù Parsons said. ‚ÄúThe idea is that we‚Äôll try to use this money to help with offsetting costs of the roads.‚Äù


If the article is passed and town staff are able to submit the paperwork to the state on time, the tax will go into effect on July 1. Twelve other communities in Franklin County have adopted the tax and, in FY24, they raised a combined $927,677 from the tax.


Other articles on the warrant include:


‚ñ†Appropriating $2,000 for the restoration and preservation of town records.

‚ñ†Appropriating $1,500 for crisis management supplies and services.

‚ñ†Approving a $734,076 broadband budget, which is paid for with user fees.

I‚Äôve been poking around these ideas through a weird little novel I worked on‚ÄîInsane Entities.

Ever feel like you‚Äôre playing life on hard mode when everyone else seems to be cruising through? üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Like you're revving the engine but aren't zooming anywhere? Yeah, been there, done that. And if you're like me, you‚Äôve probably tried stuff like **mindfulness meditation** thinking it was the holy grail of focus... but somehow you still ended up doom-scrolling or binge-watching your favorite series. üòÖ

So, let me spill the beans. After trying (and failing) to meditate my way to peak performance, I stumbled upon something totally game-changing. It‚Äôs backed by science and doesn‚Äôt involve sitting quietly while your brain goes ‚Äúhey, remember when you said that awkward thing in third grade?‚Äù

üìö **Enter: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) for the Brain!** üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yep, studies show this can help calm your mind and control cortisol levels. üí° Brainy fact: Short bursts of intense focus followed by brief moments of recovery can train your brain to work smarter, not harder.

**Here‚Äôs what worked for me:**

- **Pomodoro Technique, but with a twist:** *25 minutes of intense focus, 5 minutes of guilt-free chill (or dance party) sessions.*
  
- **Brain dumps:** First thing in the morning, jot down all those nagging thoughts. It‚Äôs like taking out the mental trash üóëÔ∏è, so your brain has space to breathe.

- **Mindful walks instead of sitting meditation:** A slow walk where you notice the little things around you. You‚Äôd be surprised how many shades of green you can spot. üå≥

- **Caffeine naps** (the secret weapon): Drink a cup of coffee then take a quick 20-minute nap. Wake up alert and ready to conquer the world. ‚òïüí™

I know, I know, there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all, and what works for me might not work perfectly for everyone. But if you‚Äôre feeling stuck in a rut, maybe swapping out silent meditation for these brain-boosters could be your golden ticket üöÄ.

So, what do you guys think? Anyone else tried ditching traditional meditation for something a bit more‚Ä¶ dynamic? Ready to chat about it over your next caffeine nap? üòâ Let's hear it!

We‚Äôre married now.

The thought brought a small smile to my face as I turned to see you still asleep beside me, your breathing steady and peaceful. It was a simple moment, but it felt significant. The start of something new.

Not wanting to wake you just yet, I carefully slipped out of bed and made my way to the kitchen. Maybe I could surprise you with breakfast‚Äîthough whether it would turn out edible was another story.

First big purchase ‚Äì They go furniture shopping and struggle to agree on a couch or dining table.

Surprise date night ‚Äì One plans a surprise date, but it doesn't go exactly as intended (maybe they get lost or the restaurant loses their reservation).

Lost wedding ring scare ‚Äì One panics after misplacing their wedding ring, only to find it in a silly place.

Pet adoption ‚Äì They consider adopting a pet and visit a shelter, debating over a dog, cat, or something else.

DIY home project gone wrong ‚Äì They try to assemble furniture or paint a room together, but it turns into chaos.

Meeting the in-laws ‚Äì A family member makes an unexpected visit, leading to some awkward or funny moments. Here are some ideas for that to add to it.

Game night rivalry ‚Äì They have a friendly but competitive board game or video game night, and things get hilariously intense.

Morning routine differences ‚Äì One is an early riser, the other loves to sleep in, leading to amusing compromises.

Holiday decorating ‚Äì They have different opinions on how to decorate for the holidays, leading to a fun mini-feud.

Tested them all out over 40 minutes, doing breaks every now and then to smell some coffee and not fatigue my smell too quickly.

**BDK**

‚Ä¢ *Citrus Riviera* - Extremely refreshing citrusy fragrance. In a way the citrus blast reminded me a lot of Aventus Cologne/Eros Energy, but with an added subtle fig note. I liked it a lot and it's gonna be excellent for the warm weather. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *Gris Charnel* - It smelled very familiar, but the odds of having smelled this and not a clone or another very similar fragrance are very low. Another fragrance with fig, but it's overall a creamy and slightly woody fragrance. I also want to try Gris Charnel Extrait, I might purchase a sample set from BDK's website. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Vanille Leather* - Think of a more feminine and more floral Eau D'Ombr√© Leather. I don't think it's necessarily a feminine fragrance, though. Very creamy vanilla fragrance with a subtle yet present leather that I think would be a great entry level leather fragrance for anyone. Liked this one a lot too. 9/10

**Clive Christian**

‚Ä¢ *C for Men Woody Leather with Oudh Intense* - Shitty name aside, this is just Ombr√© Leather EDP with an oriental spicy twist. Hoping it smells better on my skin than that did. Not a fan of Ombr√© Leather EDP so I'm also not a fan of this off first impressions, but I do like it more. 4/10

‚Ä¢ *Crab Apple Blossom* - Believe it or not, this smells like the sweet, sugary part of Virgin Island Water, despite the only note they both have in common being bergamot. Liked this one a fair bit, also seems to be good for hot weather. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Town & Country* - Winston Churchill wore this one apparently, at least the version that was made 80+ years ago. Floral and musky, almost mildly citrusy even, with a soft and creamy sandalwood that comes up a bit later. It does smell kind of elegant and refined. Looking forward to trying it out more. 9/10

**Creed**

‚Ä¢ *Viking* - Not bad but after a while a very off putting note started showing itself, kind of rubbery in a choking way. Maybe not a thing of the fragrance itself, maybe it reacted with the paper I used to test the fragrance and that's why it smelled that way, but I'll need to test it out more. What I did get was a light citrusy, green type of scent, definitely foug√®re-like. 5/10

‚Ä¢ *Viking Cologne* - Liked this way more than the ·ªçriginal. It's like you took Viking and made it more watery and fresh. I think after proper testing I'll still prefer this one. 7/10

**Ex Nihilo**

‚Ä¢ *Atlas Fever* - An improved version of Tom Ford's Fucking Fabulous. Smells less like spicy baby wipes, more like actual good quality chemicals and overall it's a woody vanilla scent with a very nice floral note that pops up after a while. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *Blue Talisman* - I had tried this one before twice, but for some reason it was an extremely mild scent, but here it's full bodied and very potent. Incredibly nice, fresh and fruity fragrance. Everyone knows this one already, can't say anything that hasn't been said before. 9/10

**Kilian's Intoxicated** - From the three gourmand-like Kilian's I've tried (Angel's Share and Black Phantom being the other two) this one is my favorite. Smells like creamy vanilla and coffee, extremely likeable. It does kind of smell like a frappuccino from Starbucks. From all the fragrances with a coffee note I've tried so far Intoxicated has the most r…õalistic one. I'll look for the travel spray, I'd probably never buy a full sized Kilian. 9/10

**Nasomatto's Pardon** - Oud, chocolate and flowers is what this smells like. Probably the most interesting fragrance I've smelled so far, it has a lot of depth to it. It started smelling funky after a while (most likely the oud), so I'll have to try it further. I like that the fragrance itself is green. 7/10

**The Harmonist's Magnetic Wood** - It didn't smell woody at all, it was mostly a floral fragrance with some citruses on the side. It's also not as feminine as I thought it would be, I think it's a perfectly unisex scent. Not that impressed here, especially not considering how expensive The Harmonist's fragrances are. 7/10",1,1746302081.0,Colognes,0,0.99,False

For example, this morning I was making coffee and my partner pushed the start button while I was away for a moment and it instantly made me tense and feel pressure all over my body. I ended up needing to take a nap and woke up feeling better but this is just one of many instances.

1ke1ky6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetReviewHub/comments/1ke1ky6/does_the_book_of_incredible_information_by/,Does The Book of Incredible Information by Publications Worth a Read Review?,"Publications International, Ltd. has once again delivered a literary gem with ""The Book of Incredible Information,"" and I had the chance to dive into its 704 pages to explore what makes it such a favorite. With an extensive hardcover design and its impressive weight of 1.8 pounds, this book feels like a commitment to knowledge, literally. Published in April 2015, this is not a new release, but I can confidently say it is a timeless addition to any bookshelf. Let me take you through my observations while I tested and explored this interesting reference book.

**Appealing Design and Structure**  
The first thing I noticed about this book is its physical presence. At 6.45 by 2 by 9.33 inches, the dimensions make it perfectly suited for cozy nights on the couch or educational coffee-table d√©cor. The hardcover provides durability, especially for someone like me who tends to accidentally drop books (often on the exact foot I need for walking). The printed pages are sturdy and thick, meaning that even after significant use, it remains in excellent condition‚Äîa valuable feature for a book meant to be revisited repeatedly.

**Exciting Variety of Content**  
What immediately stands out about this book is the incredible range of facts and information it covers. You get everything from lesser-known historical events to bizarre biological phenomena‚Äîconversations just got a lot more entertaining. It reminds me of how I‚Äôd always come up with random trivia to impress my friends, and now, I have a tool to make sure those facts are actually accurate! The mix of topics ensures you‚Äôll never get bored; every page offers something new and engaging.

**Remarkable Positives**  
The content is, without a doubt, one of the book‚Äôs strongest features. Here are some quick highlights:  
- The range of trivia topics helps ensure there‚Äôs something engaging for everyone.  
- High-quality hardcover and binding make it a lasting addition to your library.  
- With 704 pages, it‚Äôs packed with information, making it an excellent value for its price point.  

**Minor Negatives to Consider**  
While I‚Äôve enjoyed nearly every aspect of this book, it‚Äôs worth mentioning a few less favorable aspects:  
- Due to its 1.8-pound weight, this isn‚Äôt the easiest book to carry around.  
- Some sections could provide deeper exploration of topics rather than snippets.  

Not major issues in the big picture, but they‚Äôre worth noting if you‚Äôre considering this for regular, on-the-go reading.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this book to others in the reference genre, one noticeable competitor would be ‚ÄúThe World Almanac and Book of Facts.‚Äù While the latter zeros in on raw data like population statistics and annual events, ""The Book of Incredible Information"" shines in its ability to mix fun, weird details with bold and fascinating stories. Additionally, if you‚Äôre looking for an alternative like ‚ÄúRipley‚Äôs Believe It or Not,‚Äù you‚Äôll find this one much less gimmicky and far more versatile. Having flipped through all three over time, I‚Äôd say this publication wins in terms of broad usability and educational appeal.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Taking into account its hardcover build, the expansive topics covered, and its overall entertainment value, this is a smart purchase for trivia lovers and casual readers alike. You‚Äôre not just getting 704 pages of surface knowledge but truly curated, delightful tidbits that stick with you long after you close the book. While it is slightly heavier in comparison to softcover counterparts, the content‚Äôs depth and longevity completely justify that trade-off.

I like psychology and mental health and reading outside of my expertise. I like traveling to big cities as well. 

The issue I had since FIRE is most of my old friends are full time employees living far from us (1+ hour drive or in other states/countries) and/or already have children and super busy. It's really hard for me to find new friends with similar interests who are generally available and it doesn't take me more than a week just to schedule a lunch or hiking day or brunch with them. If you live in Contra Costa country or San Francisco and are interested in getting a cup of coffee with me send me a message or leave a comment. Don't worry no commitment needed and I can come to a coffee shop near you I just want to find new friends and don't want to go to gym, cooking class etc just for this purpose.

Personality: The Founder is someone who loves humanity and wishes to do whatever it takes to keep them all safe. They are a pacifist, as they never fight unless provoked, and prefers ro rehabilitate cryptids and magic creatures rather than outright hurting them. The Founder enjoys simple pleasures such as video games and TV shows, finding humanity so fascinating to make such things.

It kinda started by accident when I was sipping my morning coffee, staring blankly out the window, feeling a bit overwhelmed by all the usual life stuff. 

Suddenly, I noticed these two tiny birds sitting on the tree outside, having a lil‚Äô chat or whatever birds do. They were so carefree, hopping around without a worry in the world. It just made me stop and smile for the first time that morning.

Now, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I never thought about doing something like this; it‚Äôs a bit surprising how soothing it is. I guess we‚Äôre all looking for something that helps put our minds at ease, right? Anyway, whenever I feel a bit stressed or down, I look out for my feathered friends. It‚Äôs not a big deal, but it‚Äôs become a tiny respite I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

Have any of you found comfort in odd or unexpected hobbies? I‚Äôd love to hear if there‚Äôs anything out of the ordinary that‚Äôs helped light up your days!",1,1746301466.0,TeaAndEmpathy,0,1.0,False
1ke1e8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1ke1e8a/i_30f_really_confused_by_his_47m_hotcold/,I (30f) really confused by his (47m) hot/cold behaviour. Does he like me or not?,"We work in the same building, but not for the same company. We share common facilities and use the same cafe, laundromat, gym etc. We also catch the same bus, every couple of weeks. Despite there being around 750 people working in this building, we seem to somehow see each other frequently, probably at least a few times per day.

I first noticed him because he was basically staring at me.. like a lot. There isn‚Äôt another person in this building that I see as much as this guy. If I was chatting to a friend over coffee I‚Äôd notice him watching me in my peripherals, or walking by multiple times. Or when I‚Äôm in the gym, I see him checking me out through the mirrors and he seems to always be working out near me no matter what exercises I seem to be doing that day. Not to sound full of myself, but I‚Äôm what some would consider to be attractive (pretty face and hourglass body shape) and do tend to get hit on quite a bit, so somebody staring at me didn‚Äôt really phase me at first. Plus he‚Äôs attractive, so there‚Äôs that.

However at this point I honestly can‚Äôt say whether this dude is really into me, or absolutely hates my guts. I have never met any individual as hard to read as this guy. It‚Äôs bizarre. We‚Äôve talked multiple times, yet I‚Äôm still no further clued into what his deal is.

He‚Äôs a very reserved, quiet-type. Super intelligent (like won national awards kinda smart), attentive, good looking, soft-spoken, a tiny bit snobby tbh, and seems to swing between really friendly to stone cold/kinda rude. Some days he‚Äôll seem really interested in getting to know me, and the next he‚Äôll give me really abrupt, short replies, or blank me. For example, one day he spent about 20 minutes asking me questions about myself. Every time I tried to ask him something, he‚Äôd redirect back to me. It came up that I liked a specific kinda donut. He brought some in 2 days later, but didn‚Äôt give them to me, instead he left them in the communal area.

Next time I seen him I was quickly walking by as I head to a meeting (not in his direction I should add) and I had an immediate genuine reaction of happiness (hey, he‚Äôs cute) and casually smiled and did a little wave, and this guys face looked like he‚Äôd seen a GHOST and immediately diverted his eyes away from me. He does this often.

But after blanking me, he approached me a few days later as I was unlocking my bike. I noticed that his face was blushing and voice was shaking when he spoke. So of course after this I thought.. ok you‚Äôre being silly this guy surely likes you. Why else would he act so nervous like that, and we had a nice chat.

BUT THEN, not long after, I got into the elevator with him and a few others and asked how he was and he just point blank ignored me as if I was talking to somebody else? But I was standing opposite him and clearly talking to him lol. In fact, I noticed any time I‚Äôm the one to initiate conversation, he shuts it down really quickly (literally one time I asked if he had a good weekend and he replied ‚Äúyes‚Äù and I asked if he did anything nice and he replied ‚Äúnot really‚Äù and WALKED AWAY lollllll) . But when he approaches me first, it‚Äôs usually a long, more normal, chat.

And the more I think about it‚Ä¶ he never smiles or goofs around, is always super serious, never actually takes the conversation to the next level/asks me to go for coffee or anything. He gets nervous and awkward talking to me. He avoids eye contact with me when we pass by each other, and is just super awkward. Maybe us running into each other so much is a total coincidence and he‚Äôs actually really weirded out by me?

I honestly don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs just shy, or if he‚Äôs actually really full of himself, or if he just hates me and resents that he sees me everywhere and is trying to be civil. Idk. There‚Äôs also the possibility that he just wants to creep on me/my body and has no interest in actually getting to know me. 

Thoughts?? How do I handle someone like this? Or should I just avoid?

1ke1cuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1ke1cuk/does_the_baby_trend_expedition_double_jogger/,Does the Baby Trend Expedition Double Jogger Stroller Deliver? Detailed Review,"Testing the **Baby Trend DJ99C09B Expedition Double Jogger Stroller, Griffin** was an experience that blended the practically engineered features of the product with the real-world chaos of parenting two young children. Living in a neighborhood with uneven sidewalks and parks that demand flexibility from my daily equipment, this jogging stroller was put through its paces every single day. Here‚Äôs how it performed:

**Sturdy Design Built for Two**  
I could tell immediately the weight of the stroller (32.18 pounds) lent it a sturdy build. The alloy steel frame combined with durable polyester fabric felt reliable, even as my toddler threw occasional tantrum-led wobbles in the seat. The design seems well-suited for growing families, allowing comfortably spaced seating for two children, each up to 50 pounds. Parents hunting for durability and space might find this double stroller hits the sweet spot.  

**Smooth Maneuverability with Bicycle Tires**  
Honestly, I feared the prospect of pushing the stroller while jogging along bumpy pavement, but the inclusion of bicycle-style tires blew away my expectations. The back wheels, with their 16-inch diameter, absorbed shocks surprisingly well. The front swivel wheel could be locked when I picked up my pace or kept mobile for tight turns and sharper navigation. Navigating narrow grocery aisles or taking long walks along nature trails felt equally intuitive.  

**Convenience Features for Parents on the Go**  
The parent tray really became my ""mobile organizer."" With two cup holders and a covered compartment, I could keep my iced coffee and phone secure during our outings (because, let's admit it, caffeine is vital to parenting). The massive storage basket underneath the seats is where we stashed the diaper bag, snacks, and occasionally, my purse when I needed hands-free freedom. Every trip became a lesson in ""how much stuff can we fit in this basket?"" Spoiler: it's a lot.  
[Check Baby Trend DJ99C09B Expedition Double Jogger Stroller price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b07bvmshtz/)

**Safety First for Parents and Kids**  
Safety features were one of the stroller's high points. The adjustable 5-point safety harness kept my kids secure, which meant fewer heart-in-mouth moments. Moreover, the ratcheting shade canopy with peek-a-boo windows worked wonders for balancing sun protection with my ability to peek in and check on the kids during long walks. The reclining seat options were a bonus because accommodating a nap schedule while on-the-go felt like a win for us.  

**Pros**  
- Bicycle tires ensure smooth rides across varied terrains.  
- Adjustable reclining seats make longer excursions much easier.  
- Large undercarriage storage meets the unpredictable needs of packing for kids.  
- Peek-a-boo window on the canopy keeps things accessible.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Folding the stroller into its compact, folded size (34 x 32.25 x 16.75 inches) took a little trial and error at first, especially for the uninitiated.  
- While 32.18 pounds doesn‚Äôt sound particularly heavy, the weight can feel a bit unwieldy when loading it into the trunk.  
- EVA tires handle casual terrain with ease but may need frequent inspection on rougher trails.

**Rival Brands**  
Comparing this stroller to models like the BOB Revolution Flex 3.0 or Thule Urban Glide 2, the Baby Trend Expedition Double Jogger stands out for its price advantage and family-friendly functional design. The BOB options seem more suited for hardcore jogging enthusiasts, given their higher price tags and specialized wheel systems, while this stroller caters exceptionally well to everyday family excursions. However, other joggers like Joovy Zoom 360 might have a sleeker fold solution, appealing to parents who prioritize compact storage over built-in storage space.  

**Affordable Quality That Feels Practical**  
Given everything this stroller offers‚Äîlike multi-position reclining seats, a robust safety harness system, and ample storage‚Äîyou‚Äôre getting pretty impressive features compared to more premium-priced items on the market. The overall design of this stroller makes it not only a functional staple but a budget-friendly option for active parents juggling two kids. When balanced against competitors, you're receiving every dollar‚Äôs worth of utility.

Stay away from too much spicy acidic calcium/cholesterol combos as this will lead to irritability and negative emotion which WILL make you miss shots and have a bad game. Keep magnesium levels higher than your calcium levels sensed by feel. Keep your sodium intake to a minimum and only add it to balance your potassium levels which you will need to do. Beans and salsa! You need that folate and potassium combined w salty salsa. 

No ice cream, excess sugar, seed oils. Limit milk and coffee, both combined will not give you max performance. Limit coffee Jimmy. Get your magnesium from these other sources.

The whole place was coming down around us, rocks and lava splashing everywhere; it was a mess. The boss, a Magma Golem, was going all out while the ground was breaking apart as fire shot up in every direction. It was wild and dangerous.

This was the last fight of our long ass portal delve and it was already damned disaster, but we were still fighting. Zoe was behind me, her sniper rifle shooting up the place, striking the giant lava face with deadly accuracy. Danny, in his heavy-powered armor, was taking hits I wouldn‚Äôt survive and swinging that Warhammer of his like a barbarian. Ryan, even bleeding through his torso, was still shooting his shotgun, while I took pot shots with my rifle at the giant's head. And Emily? Panicking, as usual.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre out of time!‚Äù Emily yelled while she unloaded her weapons on the boss. What a sight she was, moving like she belonged in this crazy scenario. There was something hypnotic about watching her fight, running around with her double Energy Blasters, her armor reflecting the orange of the lava around us.

Zoe sprinted across a crumbling ledge. ‚ÄúThen let's kill it already!‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs end this!‚Äù Danny yelled in response, again swinging his Warhammer.

I looked at Ryan. ‚ÄúYou got one last stunt in you?‚Äù

Ryan smirked. ‚ÄúYou kidding? I live for this shit.‚Äù

He braced himself and started running, ripping a grenade from his belt and sprinting toward the golem, straight toward the large fucker.

‚ÄúRyan!‚Äù I yelled, out of breath.

He didn‚Äôt answer me, just ran faster to the end of the ledge, and in one stupidly perfect move, he jumped off and caught the edge of the monster‚Äôs forearm, then launched himself upward. It was stupid and reckless, fucking classic Ryan Mitchell right there.

The Magma Golem's hand lashed out and caught him. A scream tore from his throat as its red-hot hand crushed through his armor and nearly tore his arm clean off. Blood and scorched flesh sizzled on the ground as he crumpled. Shit.

‚ÄúRYAN!‚Äù I skidded to his side, my Scout boots just didn't have enough traction on the hot ground. I grabbed him just before the golem could finish the job. His arm was a mess, all blackened and torn to hell, so fucking gross.

Danny saw what was happening and roared, slamming his fist into his armor‚Äôs control pad, activating the Taunt ability. His aggro beacon activated as a pulse rippled out from his suit, forcing the giant's focus onto him.

‚ÄúCome on, motherfucker!‚Äù Danny screamed, swinging his Warhammer. ‚ÄúTry that shit on me!‚Äù

Its eyes snapped to Danny, its overlarge hands swinging toward him instead. I took the moment to pull Ryan back, ignoring his curses of pain. He didn't look good.

Danny somehow managed to avoid the golem's attack and swung his Warhammer, punching straight into its chest and exposing its core.

Ryan gasped through gritted teeth, trying to stay conscious. ‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶ looks bad, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

""Just hold on,‚Äù I said. This wasn't the moment to get emotional.

""NOW, EMILY!‚Äù

Emily unleashed both blasters, her \[Power Surge\] ability gave each of them a 30% boost in damage. She delivered a devastating barrage of energy bolts directly into the bastard's core. The Magma Golem bellowed loudly as the energy ripped through it and it crumbled into itself. It's body started glowing and we all took shelter, fireworks time baby.

The explosion sent shockwaves through the cavern. I barely hit the ground before molten debris started raining down.

\[+0 skill XP\]

\[+18,000 credits\]

\[Mission completed! Pyroclasm Defeated, reward: 0 skill XP, 115,000 credits\]

‚ÄúWoohoo, it's over,‚Äù I exhaled, sweat dripping down my face. It was hot in here, but we were done.

Emily was already grabbing a \[Quick-Clot Spray\] from her utility belt and running toward us. ‚ÄúRyan, you dumbass!‚Äù

The exit portal appeared behind us, but my eyes locked onto something else. There it was, what we had been hoping for, sleek and impossibly advanced. The Vanguard Displacement Drive.

Zoe‚Äôs voice cracked in disbelief. ‚ÄúHoly shit.‚Äù

Ryan, despite his mangled arm, was trying to stand up to approach the thing. ‚ÄúWe got it! We actually got the damn thing!‚Äù

The Vanguard Displacement Drive was huge and way too heavy for any of us to move, so naturally, Danny, flexing his powered armor, braced against the massive frame. ‚ÄúI got this, bitches.‚Äù

I exhaled, watching as he started pushing it toward the portal. This was it. This was what we had fought for.

We'd barely made it. Ryan was alive, though his left arm looked terrible, with third-degree burns and ligament damage. The squad menu in my interface had him flashing red, yet he‚Äôd live, though. Ryan was tough, a week or six in a medical pod, and he‚Äôd be right as rain. Big baby could handle it. All we needed to do was exit the portal, and our Adventuring Company's medical teams would take care of him.

And all this for what? A single FTL drive.

We were now done with Venus and its goddamn portals. Every single one was the same: boiling heat, choking air, and not even a second to take our helmets off. Absolute misery. And the IFC outpost was a goddamn sardine can: hundreds of sweaty, pissed-off people crammed into an underground bunker with no space, no privacy, and the worst bunk beds imaginable. Thank you, Karen, for your Spartan measures.

But the worst part was the wait. Venus portals were the holy grail in the Solar System, and every team wanted to get in, hoping for an FTL drive. Only one had been found so far, and ours? Ours made it two.

The queues stretched for weeks, sometimes months, to get access. If your spot came up and you weren‚Äôt there with your entire team, tough shit: back of the line. We spent half our time scrambling across the system, just making sure we didn‚Äôt miss our slot, and after thirty brutal delves and endless waiting, we finally had what we needed.

Good fucking riddance, two years to the day, since the first FTL drive had been found. And now it was ours.

[Genesys Shipyard Cafe](https://preview.redd.it/y7gle3y6dmye1.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=af2e67fb191f3c278786649de810e942fd4f6501)

I sat at the bar in my dad‚Äôs shipyard cafe, browsing through the latest auction of Europa loot drops, which had seen an uptick in 'Devastator' class weapons, and I was interested on getting a new Energy Rifle, since mine had partially melted when we met our friend the Magna Golem.

The hot chocolate in front of me was almost perfect, rich, thick, and smooth. Outside the big plate-glass portholes, all you could see was the endless dark of space. Cozy, but in that slightly rundown, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt fix things until they‚Äôre broken‚Äù way.

The Vanguard Drive had changed everything for us, but now came the hard part, building the right ship that could actually use it.

The door swung open, and he came in, my old man. He saw me and made his way over, that little smirk tugging at his mouth. *Here we go again, kid.*

‚ÄúHey, Dad,‚Äù I said, trying not to sound like I was hitting him up for cash.

He slid onto the stool across from me and waved down the server for his usual double espresso. He could probably drink rocket fuel and still sleep like a baby.

We shot the shit for a bit, talked about my brothers, my team, and whatever small talk we could scrape together. It was mostly him asking about the latest portal delve, Ryan's injury, and me trying to make it sound less dangerous than it was. You know, the usual.

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the emergency that couldn‚Äôt wait?‚Äù he asked.

I pulled out my laptop and turned it toward him.

He didn‚Äôt touch it and just looked at me for a moment. He already knew what this was, probably since the moment I asked him to meet with me. Karen must have briefed him.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the ship,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúAre you sure you want to do this?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could sell it, you know. Half the corporations would kill for it,"" he said. ""Hell, someone else could build the ship. Let the IFC throw some credits at it and put one of their teams in charge.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd wait for someone else to map out Alpha Centauri?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything; I just waited while he studied the layout. I had done an impressive job drawing out what we wanted in the ship, though Emily might disagree; *any kid can draw better than you*, she'd said.

‚ÄúYou planning to come back?‚Äù he asked me.

That caught me off guard. ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said quickly. I didn't want him to think we were bailing on him, not after Mom.

He didn‚Äôt answer; he just stirred his coffee and then sipped while staring at the sketch.

After a while, he said, ‚ÄúYour mother would‚Äôve told you to go; she always said the stars were waiting.‚Äù There was a hint of sadness in his voice.

""Is that so wrong?"" I asked. I needed this escape, this chance to prove myself, and maybe my team did too, we'd spent too long delving and fighting to survive in those damn portals, even after hitting the level cap, always under supervision, being the perfect team, scrounging credits and equipment. We deserved a break from the grind, a chance to see something beyond Earth and its endless politics.

‚ÄúBut she believed in you,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúSo do I, it's just... you‚Äôre asking for a lot here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking for a fighting chance, Dad,"" I said.

He looked at me with his intense black eyes like he wanted to argue, like he wanted to be the voice of reason, but I‚Äôd heard it all before, before every trip out to Mars, Europa, or Venus. For a second, I thought he was going to shut it down and spiral into one of his arguments.

‚ÄúYou always were a stubborn little shit.‚Äù

I smiled back at him, ‚ÄúTakes one to know one.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a large project, and it isn‚Äôt going to be cheap,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúJust the structure alone, the engines, building materials, furnishings? You want a goddamn lounge? Why?‚Äù

I shrugged. ""I know it‚Äôs a big undertaking, Dad. But I‚Äôve run the math. Between our savings and the financial backing from Karen at the IFC we can make this happen.""

He raised his eyebrow. ""This is... ambitious, Luca,"" he said. *Reckless or stupidly hopeful would've been more accurate.* ""You do realize what you're asking for, right? What you want isn't just another ship, but rather a whole different class. We don't build those here, not yet. The cost alone, we're talking at least 400 or 500 million credits, just in materials. I'd need to expand my spacedock and commission a larger gantry.""

For a second, my stomach dropped. Half a billion credits?

""I know it‚Äôs a lot, Dad,"" I said, ‚Äúbut we'll make it back. We find something valuable out there, new resources, new technology, or¬† rich asteroids. It'll pay for itself. And Karen believes in the mission. She greenlit the Triumph Initiative, remember?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe greenlit the pitch deck,‚Äù he replied.

I had nothing to say to that. We had the charter and needed a ship, a good ship.

He slid the laptop back toward me. ‚ÄúAlright, we‚Äôll see what we can do.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Dad.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt thank me yet,‚Äù he muttered, his eyes still on the screen. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still going to owe me after this.‚Äù

We clinked mugs. His espresso. My hot chocolate.

In the back of my mind, though, I was already having doubts. There was too much riding on this, and we were all risking so much. But I pushed them aside. We'd figure it out. We usually did, and I wasn't ready to let this go.",1,1746300943.0,u_dresidalton,0,1.0,False

Tucked just behind Parliament Square and the Queen‚Äôs Staircase, West Hill Street blends Bahamian history, vibrant street life, art, and boutique charm‚Äîmaking it a must-visit spot for locals, newcomers, and tourists alike.

What Makes West Hill Street Special?
* Heritage ArchitectureThe street is lined with pastel-painted, colonial-era buildings that give a timeless feel. Walking here feels like stepping into old Nassau‚Äîpeaceful, colorful, and alive with history.
* Graycliff EstateOne of the most iconic attractions, Graycliff is home to a luxury hotel, chocolate factory, cigar company, fine dining restaurant, and even a wine cellar with over 250,000 bottles. It‚Äôs the crown jewel of the area and offers tours, tastings, and upscale relaxation.
* Heritage Museum of The BahamasLocated right on the street, this small but fascinating museum dives into Bahamian history‚Äîfrom pirates to plantations to independence. Great for kids and history buffs alike.

1ke13i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ke13i9/bile_leakage/,Bile leakage?,"I‚Äôm a 25 year old female, turning 26 next week. I‚Äôm 210 pounds and 5‚Äô3‚Äù. I have been diagnosed with scoliosis, (had surgery in 2009) depression + anxiety, hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis, GERD and I have an esophageal(?) hernia. I‚Äôm not currently taking any medications, and I am 100000% sure I‚Äôm not pregnant, as my partner is female and we‚Äôve been together for 4 years. 

In August of 2022, I had my gallbladder removed following 2 emergency visits and an urgent care visit. According to my surgeon, the gallbladder was badly infected and was filled with sludge, so it needed to come out. There was also a gallstone about the side of a peanut m&m lol. Once the gallbladder was removed, I healed okay, and I was able to eat normally within a few months. With the digestive issues I already have, bouts of nausea are pretty normal for me. I take famotidine as needed, but not regularly. I took one yesterday and it seemed to help a little, but not for long. 

Yesterday afternoon, I started experiencing upper abdominal pain. It‚Äôs localized to the middle + left side of my abdomen, under my ribs. Not horrible, but not comfortable either. 5-6 on the pain scale. Throughout the day and the night, I worsened. I never threw up, but I was nauseous for hours, and the pain persisted. In the middle of the night I was very chilly, and could not seem to get warm. I eventually fell asleep, but woke several times in a cold sweat. My partner also said my skin was very hot, so I suspect a fever. I didn‚Äôt get up to check, though. When I woke up I felt okay, just hungry, really. 

After eating a very small and bland breakfast with coffee, I started feeling sick again. I didn‚Äôt eat for a while, then I tried eating again. Almost as soon as I swallowed, I had pain in my abdomen, and I felt nauseous. 

I‚Äôm concerned I might have a bile leak as a result of one of the duct clamps slipping. Is that possible? I checked the whites of my eyes as well and they seem off-white but not jaundiced. 

Unfortunately I do not have insurance or sufficient funds for an ER visit, nor do I have a primary physician. Not that I expect a perfect answer from this subreddit, but I‚Äôm just curious if anybody thinks this is worthy of an ER visit? Could it be some kind of rupture? Could the hernia be causing issues? If anyone has any help or information it would be most appreciated! 

Also wanna mention, bowels are moving normally lol 

TLDR; Upper GI pain and nausea. Concerned it may be a bile leak following gallbladder removal (3 years ago.) ",1,1746300638.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

I'm reaching out here during a challenging time in my life with a request for a little assistance. I tried to reach out last week with little to no response. 

Right now, I'm sitting in a Dunkin' Donuts, actively job hunting and trying to get back on my feet. Unfortunately, I'm currently experiencing homelessness and living out of my car, which can start for AC and charging but is out of gas.

I'm kindly asking for any help you can offer for gas and coffee. I understand that not everyone may be comfortable sending money, so I am more than willing to accept gift cards for coffee or a small treat, if that feels safer for you.

Any assistance would truly be appreciated and would make a big difference in my current situation. Thank you so much for your kindness and support during this difficult time.

Wishing you all the best, Thank you for reading and even considering J <3

Last sunday I was taking a proctored exam and halfway through began to feel a little nauseous, at first i thought it was due to the coffee i had in the morning or my adhd medication making my heart rate spike. however, my main symptom was that I felt unable to swallow without significant difficulty and focus and a few times i had to grip the table in a panic when i swallowed my saliva because it was so difficult. I got out of the exam and the symptoms went away with some water.

the next day on the way to work, i began to feel motion sick on the bus ride. i had the exact same sensation of not being able to swallow without difficulty which caused my anxiety to rise because of fear that maybe i was going to throw up. all of this spirals into a silent anxiety freakout on an hour long bus ride but once I get to work I‚Äôm fine and have little issue on the way home. However, on tuesday i have the same sensation on the bus ride and then begin to have this issue while eating my lunch at work. I am unable to swallow my food and have to spit it out immediately, it‚Äôs like my ability to swallow naturally disappears and my body doesn‚Äôt know what to do with foreign objects. I immediately spit the food out, feel nauseous and panicked for the rest of the day. I decided that there must be something wrong so i took 2 days off work where i had some symptoms similar but they were coming and going and not as severe.

Friday, I managed to not feel carsick on the bus in the morning however, while at work I felt extremely awful where I could not even open my lunch box without the feeling of my throat tightening and nausea and anxiety levels rising. my heart rate was around 100 while sitting down at the lunch table. I tried to eat a cracker and felt it get stuck a little in my throat when trying to swallow which rejected it. Once i got back to my desk, I drank some water which required significant difficulty. I had to grip the desk or would even do full body shudders when trying to swallow even my own saliva. on the bus ride home, I felt that I could not breathe properly due to this tight feeling in the throat and kept trying to cough to get rid of it with no success. Once home, it took me over an hour to eat my dinner of fried rice due to this blocking of my throat and extreme panicked feeling. I managed to fall asleep but woke up in an extreme panic as i kept having the sensation that I need to swallow. I followed a youtube breathing exercise video to hopefully calm me down as I was anxious and crying due to this sensation that felt like it was overtaking me.

Today, I had coffee and was able to drink it not a  problem but the feeling came back strong again during lunchtime and I was unable to finish my food. Drinking water is now risky as it results in the full body jolt I was experiencing prior and I feel like i cannot eat normally again and have had multiple panic attacks about this experience that has impacted my life severely the past week.

1ke0zfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/blogger/comments/1ke0zfi/the_benefits_of_professional_teeth_whitening/,The Benefits of Professional Teeth Whitening,"**The Benefits of Professional Teeth Whitening**

**You know this; of course, a bright, radiant smile carries the first. It increases a person‚Äôs self-esteem and gives an excellent impression. Yet age, certain food and drink items, smoking, and even medication take away the natural whiteness of the teeth as time passes. Though easy-to-get whitening items are available over the counter, professional teeth whitening through a dental health expert gives results that are beyond comparison. Here are some of the many advantages of having professional teeth whitening for your smile.**

**1. Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal**

**One noticeable fact is that professional teeth whitening comes with unquestionable brightness. Contrary to home whitening procedures which will often deliver left-deep whitening or uneven whitening results, professional treatment can remove even the most stubborn stains. Owning a whiter smile gives an outlook for youthfulness, vibrancy, and approachability. Thus, it enhances your overall beauty.**

**2. Customized Treatment for Optimal Results**

**Teeth may have all been different. In that case, a personalized plan for a single person is asked for. It is worth visiting the dentist for individualized treatment. you will have to tell which tack of teeth whitening suits you. An in-depth consult be your dentist concerning the kind of staining causing discoloration of teeth and the exact current degree of whiteness, and then he or she will plan your teeth whitening so that it will work maximally especially well.**

**3. Quick and Effective Results**

**Most of the over-the-counter whitening systems yield results that are very modest and will take weeks before they are noticed. Remarkable results will be produced, however, in many cases, some from even just one session of professional teeth whitening. In some places, you spend just an hour in the dentist‚Äôs chair and walk away with a significantly brighter smile. It is thus best for those occasions when you have to look your utmost best, such as weddings, interviews, special events, or just about any time.**

**4. Long-Lasting Brightness**

**Professional whitening treatments utilize superior quality clinically tested materials that penetrate deep into the enamel to remove stains. The results tend to last far longer when used in conjunction with proper oral care and lifestyle changes than the over-the-counter options. Likewise, dental specialists recommend aftercare to patients to assist them with keeping up with their brilliant grins.**

**5. Safe and Comfortable Experience**

**Injury to the gum and enamel surface is one of the major concerns attached to most over-the-counter whitening products. Professional teeth whitening, on the other hand, refers to an undertaking that requires the special attention of a trained tooth care practitioner and hence assures the safety of your teeth and gums. Dentists also take precautions against sensitivity, uniformly applying whitening agents for consistent results.**

**6. Improved Oral Health**

**Before professional teeth whitening procedures, it is typical to have teeth cleaned from plaque and tartar buildup. This not only benefits the treatment itself but also promotes better overall oral health. Because of this, a truly clean and healthier-appearing mouth will pose less risk to other dental problems, including cavities and gum diseases.**

**7. Boosted Self-Confidence**

**A bright white smile could change how you view yourself. A confident smile encourages you to be more open about your relationships with family members and friends at social events and work presentations or even casual talk with acquaintances. This new confidence will eventually trickle down through all sectors of your personal and professional lives.**

**8. Cost-Effective in the Long Run**

**Even if it sounds quite heavy on the pocket at first, most times, in-office teeth whitening treatment proves more economical in the long run. Many over-the-counter whitening procedures call for repeated uses, and aside from this, their results are often unpredictable, causing users to splurge even more on repeat purchases and treatments. The professional approach to whitening gives the benefit of more reliable and lasting results, thus a wise investment for your oral aesthetics.**

**9. Tailored Maintenance Plans**

**They usually use whitening take-home kits or do some follow-ups to maintain the achieved results. Such individual whitening consolidating programs may take several months or even years after the treatment for the beautiful smile to fade. Furthermore, an individual can have their teeth in optimal shape with frequent visitations to the dental clinic.**

**10. Safe for Sensitive Teeth**

**Some people have teeth that are quite sensitive, and of course, this makes them shy away from trying any kind of whitening product or procedure, in general. Most professionals will say that even sensitive teeth can have a great white smile. Using the appropriate formulations, they are able to keep discomfort to a minimum while ensuring terrific results for everyone, even those whose teeth are more sensitive.**

**Why Choose Professional Teeth Whitening Over DIY Options?**

**Home whitening kits sound very promising and convenient but they come with a price. Here is what they cannot do for you:**

* **Lower Concentration of Whitening Agents:This is the reason why people may get to use do-it-yourself kits: they are much weaker than professional formulas designed to enable unsupervised or unattended use, thus ensuring that results will not be as striking.**
* **Risk of Overuse:At-home kits can damage enamel or gum irritation if misused.**
* **Inconsistent Results:Improve uniformity of whitening without a dentist‚Äôs guidance.**

**Professional whitening does away with the healing and has reduced the risk factor of many unsafe, ineffective at-home treatments for whitening.**

**Maintaining Your Bright Smile**

**To maximize the benefits of your professional teeth whitening, consider these tips:**

* **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:¬†Brush and floss regularly to prevent new stains from forming.**
* **Avoid Staining Foods and Beverages:¬†Minimize consumption of coffee, tea, red wine, and dark-colored foods.**
* **Quit Smoking:Tobacco items are one of the main sources of tooth staining.**
* **Use a Straw:While drinking stain-prompting refreshments, utilize a straw to lessen contact with your teeth.**
* **Schedule Regular Dental Check-Ups:¬†Professional cleanings and routine exams help maintain your oral health and the longevity of your whitening results.**

**Conclusion**

**Proficient teeth brightening is something beyond a restorative treatment ‚Äî it‚Äôs a certainty promoter and an interest in your general prosperity. With its ability to deliver safe, effective, and lasting results, it far surpasses over-the-counter options in every way. Whether you‚Äôre preparing for a special occasion or simply want to enhance your everyday appearance, professional whitening is the best way to achieve a radiant, healthy-looking smile.**

**Allow your grin to sparkle more brilliantly than at any other time ‚Äî plan an expert teeth brightening meeting with your dental specialist today!**

1ke0tes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ke0tes/how_to_handle_bff_acting_out/,How to handle BFF acting out,"TL;DR:
My best friend of 4 years (23F) and I (24F) had a falling out over a trip to London for her other friend‚Äôs birthday. I asked if we could return together since I had to work, but they wanted to save ¬£12 and told me to pay the extra ¬£24 for them if I cared that much, even though they could afford it. I felt dismissed and hurt, not over the money, but how little they considered me. We spoke briefly after, but she was defensive and made unfair comparisons. Since then, we barely talk, and she hasn‚Äôt acknowledged the tension. Not sure if I should bring it up again, wait for her to, or let the friendship go.


The whole story:

Me (24F) and my BFF (23F) who I will call Rachael have been super close for the past 4 years. She has stayed in my house living with my family for month, we do so much together, like even people have said we should be dating (but we are both straight), she has been like my sister and spent so much time together and shared so much with each other since we met.

We had this problem a month ago.

So me and Rachael live in the UK and she has another best friend she‚Äôs known for about 10 years who lives in Spain, let‚Äôs call her Lucy. I have become somewhat friends with Lucy but not super close, as naturally we have a common best friend so we have spent time together because of that.

Lucy wanted to come to the UK to celebrate her birthday in London (we are based in Manchester). So we got together to buy the tickets and the problem starts here. I asked a month prior to this about buying the ticket as naturally the most you wait the more expensive they get but they have been busy so we just left it a bit last minute.

We got on a FaceTime call to buy the tickets and they mentioned they wanted to get the cheapest ticket, if they got the cheapest ticket I will have not been able to return to Manchester at the same time as them as I had to work during that time. Mind you I have asked my boss if I could work remotely from a coffee shop in London just so that  I could attend Lucy‚Äòs birthday. Even though they didn‚Äôt have any specific commitments that meant they had to return at a specific time, they wanted buy the tickets at a time I was not available to travel because they were ¬£12 cheaper.

Now I understand ¬£12 might be a lot to someone but they are not poor just to give you some context, my best friend Rachel, had gone to 2 Michelin star restaurants a couple days prior to this and a day before this happened she said we, as in me and her, should go and do the same and go to another Michelin star restaurant and that we should plan to go to a holiday to Thailand this summer.

When I said that they should return with me at the same time since we‚Äôre going together we should return together, they said that they didn‚Äôt wanna pay the difference and suggested that I should pay the difference for them so ¬£24 in total if I wanted them to return at the same time as me which I thought was just wild. The thing is I personally wouldn‚Äôt have minded too much to return by myself but the fact that they didn‚Äôt care at all, if I was bothered about returning alone or not really bothered me, especially because they asked me to pay the difference when I know that they could‚Äôve paid it because of why I explained before. Even though I don‚Äôt know about Lucy‚Äòs financial situation I know she‚Äôs not poor and if you coming to spend your birthday in London from Spain surely you do have ¬£12 to spend extra, especially because if naturally the cheapest ticket would‚Äôve been ¬£12 more expensive, and that was the cheapest price they could‚Äôve found they would‚Äôve been able to pay for it anyways.

Initially I ended up buying the tickets because I thought well I‚Äôm not too bothered by returning by myself. However later that day I decided to actually get a refund because I didn‚Äôt like the idea of having to stay by myself working from London only because they didn‚Äôt wanna spend ¬£12 extra pounds when they clearly could afford it. Rachael has to do uni work so she has been working in coffee shops lately and she could have stayed there working with me anyways.

I ended up sending a message explaining the situation on how I felt and we jumped on a quick call to talk things out. It just felt like they didn‚Äôt really care too much, like they were giggling at the beggining. My best friend Rachel was saying that I couldn‚Äôt expect to be at disposal of other peoples finances and that she doesn‚Äôt need to be explaining her financial situation to me. She made a point and said that if the cheapest train ticket would‚Äôve been ¬£12 more expensive she actually wouldn‚Äôt have paid that which I know is a lie since the trip was already planned ahead of time so she would have paid it. Then she was using an example about how sometimes she comes to my house which is just on the outskirts of Manchester (but only about 40 minutes) and after spending 3/4 days she she has to return by herself to her house in Manchester, according to her that it‚Äôs the same situation as she‚Äôs travelling alone. Which is not true because 40 minutes travelling from my house to her house alone is not the same, specially when she is just returning to her own house and when the context it‚Äôs not a girls trip! Honestly the points she made just felt dismissive.

At the end of the call we never really got to an agreement but I feel like she was just being defensive and not really caring about my feelings at all, the points she was making were dismissive and not made any sense (based on what I said on the previous paragraph). This happened three weeks plus ago and since then we haven‚Äôt really spoken.

Since them we have not really spoken much, before we used to speak to each other all the time talk on FaceTime all the time and hang out in person. But since then the communication has dropped.

Some of you might think she might not be aware of the fact that the situation hurt me but this is not true. I know this because when she asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday about 2 weeks ago and I said that I bought tickets to go to Amsterdam but never invited her. Because we‚Äôre so close if I would‚Äôve bought tickets to go to Amsterdam she would‚Äôve been the first person to be invited especially because we travel together all the time and because our close best friend lives there and we have been talking about going to Amsterdam for a long time. The next message was her asking me if I already have bought the tickets. And I said yes, I did last week, then she left me on read. The next time she texted me was to wish me happy birthday about a week after this first exchange of messages. She sent me a voice note that was very nice as if everything is fine, but still didn‚Äôt address the situation at all. Normally she would‚Äôve called me to wish me a happy birthday, posted me on her IG story but I know she knows there is an elephant in the room because she did none of that. But that was the end of the conversation.

Is the right decision to wait for her to talk about it and bring it up? Clearly she is aware the situation hurt me, I know she is a proud person maybe that‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt want to take the first step. Or should I be the one addressing it telling her I don‚Äôt think what she did was right specially because of how she handled the situation and because it‚Äôs been nearly a month and she is knows something is up since the last phone call but does not want to address it and acts like nothing is happening.

Or Should I not talk about it and cut her off? I feel like a lot of the time she takes more than she gives and is a bit selfish, like she does not consider other people‚Äôs feelings (she is aware of this as she has admitted to this before).",1,1746299879.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1ke0ro8,https://i.redd.it/0kovbo8q9mye1.jpeg,"To end procrastion, I've made myself a 'Task Jar' - contains small household tasks ranging from 5-15 minutesto pick from! Hopefully this will help me and keep my house in check!","As the title says. I thought of this spontaneously today and decided to give it a go! 

I thought I'd run it here quick too and see if it helps anyone. You can do it however you like, just keep to the bare minimum rules so you are guaranteed to cover main objectives. 

Rules:

Pick one task, set the timer on your phone, complete it in that timeframe.

You MUST ensure you do a different room each day for your first task.

If you want, you can pick ANOTHER task after your first one, and repeat (doesn't have to be the same room). You can only do this up to four times a day - it depends on your energy levels! Don't overdo it. 
The goal is to do a bit here and there and not have chores consume your life!

Depending on energy, you can put the 15 minute task back if picked (maximum three times a week) - but these are the ONLY ones you can do so. You don't have to achieve the full 10 minutes, but try to get as close as possible!


How I've put it together:

- Drew a column on an A4 sheet, split into three columns and colour coded each box, and added these numbers on the top grids

C1: 5   C2: 10   C3: 15 (all minutes - you will set a timer on your phone for what's assigned when picked) 

Write them on different colored sheets to separate them if needed 

- In Column 5 I added any quick tasks. 

These are easy and far less strenuous for if I am having a low energy day, or just need a 5 min 'blitz' to keep my dopamine up.

Eg: spray and wipe down kitchen counters 

- Column 2 is for slightly more dedicated tasks and have a 'bonus' twist! 

Basically if I complete the task, and I feel a bit motivated there is a bonus task on the paper for me to do that's short

Eg: Bleach and scrub toilet, spray and wipe down seat and toilet surface area - Bonus task: dust skirting board in bathroom or bleach sink and wipe down and rinse

- Column 3 is the 'bigger' individual room tasks, again you DON'T have to do these, but you can only decline them three times a week. This is to help keep focus on one room specifically. 

Eg: spray kitchen sink and hob top & leave to soak, put all washing up away, wipe down all kitchen surface side, clean hob and scrub and rinse sink 

Make sure you assign only TWO 15 mins tasks per room, each covers main objects so you are guaranteed to keep on top of things. You can pick 5-10 min tasks afterwards if you want! 

Of course reward yourself, the bigger the task the better the reward! You can even 'collect' tasks to do what I do and treat yourself to an iced coffee at the end of the week. My goal is to do a minimum of 1 hour of tasks per week.

Hope this helps!

Friday, I managed to not feel carsick on the bus in the morning however, while at work I felt extremely awful where I could not even open my lunch box without the feeling of my throat tightening and nausea and anxiety levels rising. my heart rate was around 100 while sitting down at the lunch table. I tried to eat a cracker and felt it get stuck a little in my throat when trying to swallow which rejected it. Once i got back to my desk, I drank some water which required significant difficulty. I had to grip the desk or would even do full body shudders when trying to swallow even my own saliva. on the bus ride home, I felt that I could not breathe properly due to this tight feeling in the throat and kept trying to cough to get rid of it with no success. Once home, it took me over an hour to eat my dinner of fried rice due to this blocking of my throat and extreme panicked feeling. I managed to fall asleep but woke up in an extreme panic as i kept having the sensation that I need to swallow. I followed a youtube breathing exercise video to hopefully calm me down as I was anxious and crying due to this sensation that felt like it was overtaking me. 

Today, I had coffee and was able to drink it not a  problem but the feeling came back strong again during lunchtime and I was unable to finish my food. Drinking water is now risky as it results in the full body jolt I was experiencing prior and I feel like i cannot eat normally again and have had multiple panic attacks about this experience that has impacted my life severely the past week.

But trust me, these compact, eco-friendly sheets are the furthest thing from complicated. I decided to swap my traditional liquid detergent with these innovative laundry sheets, curious how they‚Äôd perform in my weekly laundry warzone. They promise 60 loads of clothes cleaned with minimal effort, no plastic residue, and a light fresh scent. After weeks of testing these on everything from sweaty gym clothes to delicate fabrics, I can confidently say they‚Äôre a fascinating product, but there's room for consideration.

**Design and Convenience**  
These detergent sheets redefine convenience. Packaged in a slim, lightweight box, they easily tuck into any cabinet without occupying the excessive space of traditional detergent jugs. No more wrestling with heavy plastic bottles or precise measuring cups! The premeasured sheets eliminate the guesswork, making laundry less of a chore. I found them especially handy during my recent weekend trip. Toss a couple of sheets into my luggage, and voila! No mess or potential spills to worry about. They're suited for life on the go, a blessing for frequent travelers or anyone embracing minimalist habits.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
Tackling stains is where things often get personal, and this product doesn't mess around. During my use, these sheets handled everything from coffee stains on my favorite white shirt to post-hike muddy jeans. They cleaned effectively during both hot and cold cycles, leaving our clothes odor-free. I particularly noticed that my son‚Äôs grass-stained soccer uniform came out crisp-clean in one wash, something even my old liquid detergent struggled to achieve. However, while they manage most daily messes, they might need a backup when dealing with extreme, ground-in grease stains. For lighter cleaning tasks, though, these sheets were flawless.

**Eco-Friendly and Skin-Friendly Formula**  
True to their eco-conscious pitch, these detergent sheets replace bulky plastic jugs with an environmentally considerate alternative. They‚Äôre free of optical brighteners, parabens, and artificial dyes. Since one of my kids has sensitive skin, I‚Äôm always cautious about harsh detergents that cause irritation. These sheets passed the skin-test with flying colors‚Äîno itching or redness in sight. It's also great to know that Earth Breeze gives back by donating laundry detergent to shelters and disaster relief organizations, which adds extra karma points.

**Strengths**  
- Offers compact, travel-friendly packaging.  
- Safe for sensitive skin with a dermatologist-tested recipe.  
- Eco-conscious design with no harsh chemicals or plastic waste.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Struggles with stubborn, deeply ingrained stains.  
- Dissolves slower in certain washers with minimal water usage.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
The laundry detergent aisle has no shortage of options, ranging from Tide Pods to Seventh Generation detergents. While the pods offer convenience similar to sheets, they can't boast the same plastic-free advantages. Seventh Generation‚Äôs eco ethos competes closely, yet their liquid detergent isn‚Äôt as portable or shelf-friendly as Earth Breeze. In terms of all-around practicality and eco-responsibility, these sheets hold their ground. That said, if you‚Äôre someone constantly battling tough stains, you might occasionally revisit stronger alternatives like Persil for added stain-busting power.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Comparing these to typical liquid detergents, their value lies in the ease of use and absence of waste. While the upfront cost may initially seem higher than bargain detergent gallons, the fact that you get 60 quality loads is a fair trade-off. Moreover, the hassle-free experience of not managing heavy jugs or spillage makes them worth considering for those prioritizing time and efficiency. All things considered, these sheets hit that sweet spot between sustainability and performance.

1ke0pj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ke0pj9/it_was_a_good_night/,It was a good night.,"Yesterday morning, I(M27) get a call from the homie Shawn. He's getting promoted to an operations manager position in Austin; to celebrate - the crew is going out for drinks & I was invited. I nearly declined to go because I'm an introverted homebody & and my car is a shitheap. But then this fucker said ""We're going to that grilled cheese spot, half priced happy hour Bro."" 

Me: ""Alright say less; but imma need a pickup, Uber & Lyft be damned."" 

Shawn: ""Bet, I'll call ya when I'm close dude.""

The evening came, shawn picked me up & we're heading to the bar. And as soon as we pulled up; Spencer, Juan, The Chase twins, and Rahvi were all in the parking lot. The crew was here plus others I didn't know personally, sorta friends of friends I now added in my small circle. We went in & we're the largest close-knit group of the joint. We got drinks and grilled cheese, played pool outside, told stories, talked about life & shit, busting each other's balls & funny bullshit. 

I went back inside briefly to grab me yet another Modelo, and this Muscle girl (who we'll call Haley, F28) from a different group APPROACHED ME!! She was 6'3 (in punk-rock styled boots) as if she was going for a Rhea Ripley kinda look, I digged Haley's outfit & complimented her style. Haley compliment back mentioning my suede puffer vest & ed, edd & Eddy T-shirt and jeans. But while we were talking I repositioned myself to get a glimpse of her group where she was originally at, just making sure I'm not getting punk'd.

Haley: ""if you're thinking that this is a prank, it's not. I genuinely think you're cute."" 

I made it obvious of what I was thinking just by body language, but I took one last look at her friends and decided to take her word for it to, some extent. We conversed for an hour and a half & we learn we had similar interests & hobbies; even our endgame goals were somewhat aligned. She then asked me if I wanted to head back to her place, I declined. ""Because I know my crew of jackasses are wasted & someone's got to drive them back."" I said (Also, I wanted her to know that I was the honorable & serious type not just looking for a screw.)

Me: ""Maybe another time, like say.. after a dinner date at maggiano's? Or Texas Roadhouse?""

Haley: Fuck yes.

I gave her my number, and we all went home. I was kind of panicking, because I have forgotten to get her number in my phone. But she texted me  ""good morning"" along with a pic of her.

Right now, I'm thankful that I got a good group of friends looking out for each other. Even more thankful for my boy Shawn convincing me to GTFO out the house. Now I'm looking forward to a coffee date this coming Monday.

The room is in a 2-bedroom apartment (the other bedroom will be occupied by one girl when she's in town during summer), and there are 1.5 shared bathrooms (full bath upstairs, half bath downstairs).

The location is ideal with G, J, P, Q, B, 42A, and 42B bus stops nearby, and a shopping plaza (Safeway, CVS, Peet's Coffee, etc.) right across the street. Amenities include a pool and jacuzzi, a laundry room, and a study room. The rent for this unit would be $1371/month plus utilities.

If you're just tuning in, you're going to want to start at the beginning! 

Below is the link for Update 2.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/s/BIG2UYHqDt

At the beginning of each update is a link to the previous post. I'm nowhere near smart enough to work out how to post multiple links!!

Since my last post, life has thrown a couple of curveball. Someone has passed away, washing machine exploded, one of the pooches got sick, I hurt my back and I broke my only decent pair of glasses! Thank you, in advance, for your condolences and kind words regarding my loss. The pooch is better, as is my back and I'm wearing contact lenses, which I hate, until the glasses situation is sorted.

Moving on to why you're all really here and it's not a happy update but there is a tiny twist! It's another long one so grab a drink and a snack, get comfortable and enjoy.

The cat is out of the bag!

Whilst enjoying coffee with a friend, one of the sisters called and was, in the most long winded manner, asking for updates. My idiot friend, that I love with all my heart, then asked, VERY LOUDLY, ""is this what your Reddit post is about?""  I replied with ""no. What are you talking about?"" whilst simultaneously making wild hand gestures to get them to shut up and they completely missed the signal and went on a tangent, giving ME the details of MY posts!! I could have throttled them!

Sister heard, said a few choice words, hung up and then the battle began. 3 sisters and a mother all texting and trying to call, demanding explanations and wanting to know why I was being mean to them and blah blah blah.

I put my phone on silent and ignored everything. I was a little sad that I wasn't going to have any more fun with this. BUT, seeing as we all know how much Queen Charlotte loves wedding drama and petty revenge, my brain switched on, fired up the engine for my train of thoughts and that beast went hurtling down the tracks!!

I called a friend, let's call him D, and explained everything and asked for his help and he was very excited to help me.

He wore a suit. I did my makeup, false nails, borrowed a white summer dress and sandals.... you can see where this going, can't you?! 

I sent pictures of our ""wedding"" and told them the following fairytale. 

""We met about a year ago, through a dumpster diving group and both of us knew that we'd found our soul mate and wanted to get married. We knew that everyone would be against it so we did an intimate ceremony in the park just 5 weeks after we met. We didn't have the time or money for a big wedding and, to show my commitment to him, we married under his religion which I'm currently converting to. I know Voodoo has a lot of bad press but it's nothing like how it's been portrayed. I didn't know how to tell you so I didn't say anything. I'm so sorry"".

Just to paint a picture for you. I am 5""7, 120 lbs, glow in the dark white and D, my ""husband"", is 6""8, a delicious dark chocolate (his words, not mine. He isn't lying though) Hercules, with dreadlocks. D's dreadlocks aren't anything to fo with culture or religion. He grew his hair out for years so he could have locks because he wanted to dress up as Predator for Halloween. It took him 3 years to grow them and he never took them out after fulfilling his dream! Also, we are both Atheists.

The females went crazy, thus bringing it their ignorance and small mindedness. They have no issues with his skin color at all but his ""religion"" sent them over the edge and they now think I'm sacrificing both small animals and children so I can gain power in the universe, or whatever BS it was.

Before anyone gets upset about me using Voodoo in a negative way, I want to clarify a few things. Whilst I am an Atheist, I find religion fascinating and have studied many of them. I've read the Old and New Testaments, the Torah, the Quran, the Pali Tipitaka, the Hoodoo Bible and others. I specifically chose Voodoo because it's so misunderstood and, correct me if I'm wrong, I've never seen it portrayed in any positive manner with the various mediums of media so I knew it would get a rise out of them.

So, whilst there may not be a ""wedding"", there may be plenty of tales of my Voodoo divorce. ü§£ü§£

Guys and Dolls, it's been my pleasure to entertain you with the crazy that resonates through the second X chromosome in my family. I hope you've had as much  fun reading about it as I have had living it! 

To my sisters and my mother, should you ever find this post, I wish to say just this. If you're big enough to stir sh!t, you best be prepared to lick the spoon.

See you, love you, bye üòò",13,1746299314.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,8,0.93,False

Recently my wife has shown interest in coffee for the first time. Not only since we met but for the first time in her life. 

I currently have a V60 setup with the Comandante C40. She absolutely hates the idea to grind the coffee by hand and would rather skip the coffee at all. 

Since I started to get annoyed by grinding by hand to I decided that I should get a Fellow Ode. But here comes my problem: I can only afford either the gen. 1 version or sell my Comandante to finance the gen. 2 model. 

If the quality of the Fellow Ode gen. 2 is only slightly worse than the Comandante I am not going to miss grinding by hand and will happily sell my Comandante. But if there is a noticeable decrease in quality I rather keep my hand grinder for the moments where I am willing to grind by hand to get the best quality I can. 

My budget is with 150‚Ç¨ almost exactly the price of the gen. 1 version. At the same time the used value of my Comandante is with about 200‚Ç¨ almost exactly the difference between the gen. 1 and gen. 2 model. 

Unfortunately saving money over time is not really an option, since I can only safe about 50‚Ç¨ a month and I am worried that in 4 months my wife has lost all her interest in coffee. 

I believe that this is the only chance to pull my wife into the world of coffee and I don‚Äôt want to mess it up!",2,1746299089.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

1ke0dd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1ke0dd1/excited_about_my_language_journey/,Excited about my language journey,"I‚Äôve never used Reddit much before this, other than lurking here and there related to some hobbies or interests, but I recently found this sub as part of my Italian studies and I just wanted to share my excitement and satisfaction with how it‚Äôs going with other like-minded folks (plus, I can only gush so much to my family and friends about something they don‚Äôt care about lol)!

My family and I are planning to go to Italy for the first time this summer, and because one of my favorite parts about traveling is trying to meet locals and get off the beaten tourist path, I decided I‚Äôd put myself through a crash course in Italian to at least get some basics down, and hopefully get decently conversational.  The background here is that while I‚Äôm a native English speaker, I studied Spanish all through school (it was one of my college degrees) and I studied for a year in Argentina, and though I don‚Äôt use it on a daily basis, I‚Äôve tried to keep it up.  I‚Äôve forgotten some of the grammar minutiae over the years, but I‚Äôll periodically read books in Spanish to keep up my vocab, and when we traveled to Spain last summer, I was able to get right back in the flow of things with the language.  I hadn‚Äôt studied Italian before this, and I only had a few months before our trip, but it seemed feasible to get somewhat conversational given the similarity of the language.

With that as a starting point, I started with Duolingo as a basic intro, but immediately supplemented that with some podcasts (Coffee Break Italian and Joy of Languages/5 Minute Italian).  And somewhat to my surprise, I almost immediately fell in love with the language.  I say ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù because I‚Äôve never had any particular interest in Italian or visiting Italy - which always struck me as the ultimate tourist trap, having spent my time abroad in college in South American countries less overrun by Americans (at that time), but something just immediately grabbed me once I started and I‚Äôve become a bit obsessed!  I started binging Italian language television and films on Netflix, first with English subtitles, then with Italian subtitles, and now I‚Äôm trying to do my best without any subtitles.  I‚Äôve continued to listen to the podcasts in all my time walking to and from work or errands and in other free time, and I picked up a couple of grammar workbooks, along with Olly Richards‚Äô book ‚ÄúShort Stories in Italian‚Äù to continue learning new vocab and grammar.  I read that out loud for pronunciation practice, and I‚Äôm constantly saving words and phrases I learn from all of this to some handwritten notes along with a flash card app for practicing.

I‚Äôm approaching about 2 months of this now, and I‚Äôd estimate I‚Äôve put around 80-100 hours into these varying practice methods, and it‚Äôs been immensely satisfying to feel my comprehension and comfort with the language increase.  I‚Äôve even been able to watch a full movie without subtitles and follow it well enough to catch some wordplay jokes and (mostly) get everything that was going on lol.  I‚Äôve found myself thinking and talking to myself in Italian as I do basic tasks, just because it‚Äôs good practice and also because I‚Äôve immersed myself in the language enough that I can‚Äôt help it.

And after seeing it mentioned many times in here, I‚Äôve now tried out a couple of sessions with Italki tutors.  I‚Äôve done two 30-minute sessions, all in Italian (or an occasional sentence in Spanish when I mix things up!), and it‚Äôs been an absolute blast.  I have so much further to go, and I know from experience that the more I learn in a language, the more I realize there is to learn, but I‚Äôm already decently conversational at a basic level and I‚Äôm confident I‚Äôll be able to get my family around Italy pretty well.  My goal is definitely to get more than the basics though - I love meeting people and talking to locals, and I think I‚Äôll be ready for that by the time we go in another couple months.  I also think it‚Äôs a good example for my kids about the kind of travelers we want to be, so hopefully it also encourages them to learn and explore other languages (my daughter is studying Spanish and my son is starting to show interest in Spanish now too).

Anyway - there wasn‚Äôt much point to this post other than to share my enthusiasm and excitement about the Italian language and the process of learning it.  It‚Äôs been a wonderful reminder why I studied a foreign language all those years ago in college and wanted to live abroad - learning a new language really ignites a passion that was sadly easy to forget among years of work, family, life, etc.  I know plenty of other folks here can relate to this excitement and I just wanted to share this somewhere where it‚Äôs hopefully appreciated!",2,1746298724.0,italianlearning,4,1.0,False

1ke0d7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ke0d7m/how_to_handle_bff_fallout_help/,How to handle BFF Fallout - help,"TL;DR:
My best friend of 4 years (23F) and I (24F) had a falling out over a trip to London for her other friend‚Äôs birthday. I asked if we could return together since I had to work, but they wanted to save ¬£12 and told me to pay the extra ¬£24 for them if I cared that much, even though they could afford it. I felt dismissed and hurt, not over the money, but how little they considered me. We spoke briefly after, but she was defensive and made unfair comparisons. Since then, we barely talk, and she hasn‚Äôt acknowledged the tension. Not sure if I should bring it up again, wait for her to, or let the friendship go.


The whole story:

Me (24F) and my BFF (23F) who I will call Rachael have been super close for the past 4 years. She has stayed in my house living with my family for month, we do so much together, like even people have said we should be dating (but we are both straight), she has been like my sister and spent so much time together and shared so much with each other since we met. 

We had this problem a month ago. 

So me and Rachael live in the UK and she has another best friend she‚Äôs known for about 10 years who lives in Spain, let‚Äôs call her Lucy.
I have become somewhat friends with Lucy but not super close, as naturally we have a common best friend so we have spent time together because of that.

Lucy wanted to come to the UK to celebrate her birthday in London (we are based in Manchester). So we got together to buy the tickets and the problem starts here. I asked a month prior to this about buying the ticket as naturally the most you wait the more expensive they get but they have been busy so we just left it a bit last minute. 

We got on a FaceTime call to buy the tickets and they mentioned they wanted to get the cheapest ticket, if they got the cheapest ticket I will have not been able to return to Manchester at the same time as them as I had to work during that time. Mind you I have asked my boss if I could work remotely from a coffee shop in London just so that  I could attend Lucy‚Äòs birthday. Even though they didn‚Äôt have any specific commitments that meant they had to return at a specific time, they wanted buy the tickets at a time I was not available to travel because they were ¬£12 cheaper.

Now I understand ¬£12 might be a lot to someone but they are not poor just to give you some context, my best friend Rachel, had gone to 2 Michelin star restaurants a couple days prior to this and a day before this happened she said we, as in me and her, should go and do the same and go to another Michelin star restaurant and that we should plan to go to a holiday to Thailand this summer. 

When I said that they should return with me at the same time since we‚Äôre going together we should return together, they said that they didn‚Äôt wanna pay the difference and suggested that I should pay the difference for them so ¬£24 in total if I wanted them to return at the same time as me which I thought was just wild. The thing is I personally wouldn‚Äôt have minded too much to return by myself but the fact that they didn‚Äôt care at all, if I was bothered about returning alone or not really bothered me, especially because they asked me to pay the difference when I know that they could‚Äôve paid it because of why I explained before. Even though I don‚Äôt know about Lucy‚Äòs financial situation I know she‚Äôs not poor and if you coming to spend your birthday in London from Spain surely you do have ¬£12 to spend extra, especially because if naturally the cheapest ticket would‚Äôve been ¬£12 more expensive, and that was the cheapest price they could‚Äôve found they would‚Äôve been able to pay for it anyways. 

Initially I ended up buying the tickets because I thought well I‚Äôm not too bothered by returning by myself. However later that day I decided to actually get a refund because I didn‚Äôt like the idea of having to stay by myself working from London only because they didn‚Äôt wanna spend ¬£12 extra pounds when they clearly could afford it. Rachael has to do uni work so she has been working in coffee shops lately and she could have stayed there working with me anyways. 

I ended up sending a message explaining the situation on how I felt and we jumped on a quick call to talk things out. It just felt like they didn‚Äôt really care too much, like they were giggling at the beggining. My best friend Rachel was saying that I couldn‚Äôt expect to be at disposal of other peoples finances and that she doesn‚Äôt need to be explaining her financial situation to me. She made a point and said that if the cheapest train ticket would‚Äôve been ¬£12 more expensive she actually wouldn‚Äôt have paid that which I know is a lie since the trip was already planned ahead of time so she would have paid it. Then she was using an example about how sometimes she comes to my house which is just on the outskirts of Manchester (but only about 40 minutes) and after spending 3/4 days she she has to return by herself to her house in Manchester, according to her that it‚Äôs the same situation as she‚Äôs travelling alone. Which is not true because 40 minutes travelling from my house to her house alone is not the same, specially when she is just returning to her own house and when the context it‚Äôs not a girls trip! Honestly the points she made just felt dismissive. 

At the end of the call we never really got to an agreement but I feel like she was just being defensive and not really caring about my feelings at all, the points she was making were dismissive and not made any sense (based on what I said on the previous paragraph). This happened three weeks plus ago and since then we haven‚Äôt really spoken.

Since them we have not really spoken much, before we used to speak to each other all the time talk on FaceTime all the time and hang out in person. But since then the communication has dropped. 

Some of you might think she might not be aware of the fact that the situation hurt me but this is not true. I know this because when she asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday about 2 weeks ago and I said that I bought tickets to go to Amsterdam but never invited her. Because we‚Äôre so close if I would‚Äôve bought tickets to go to Amsterdam she would‚Äôve been the first person to be invited especially because we travel together all the time and because our close best friend lives there and we have been talking about going to Amsterdam for a long time. The next message was her asking me if I already have bought the tickets. And I said yes, I did last week, then she left me on read. The next time she texted me was to wish me happy birthday about a week after this first exchange of messages. She sent me a voice note that was very nice as if everything is fine, but still didn‚Äôt address the situation at all. Normally she would‚Äôve called me to wish me a happy birthday, posted me on her IG story but I know she knows there is an elephant in the room because she did none of that. But that was the end of the conversation.

Is the right decision to wait for her to talk about it and bring it up? Clearly she is aware the situation hurt me, I know she is a proud person maybe that‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt want to take the first step. Or should I be the one addressing it telling her I don‚Äôt think what she did was right specially because of how she handled the situation and because it‚Äôs been nearly a month and she is knows something is up since the last phone call but does not want to address it and acts like nothing is happening. 

Or Should I not talk about it and cut her off? I feel like a lot of the time she takes more than she gives and is a bit selfish, like she does not consider other people‚Äôs feelings (she is aware of this as she has admitted to this before).

Sam vs Ethan debate

**Sam: You felt like because Hasan wasn't Jewish he didn't have a perspective on this and that's why he suggested that you speak to me. I don't speak for all Jews just to be clear. I speak for only myself.**

E:  I mean that's a total mischaracterization which is kind of my problem with Hassan which we can get into if you want.
We don't even have to talk about Hasan but basically

what I told him was that I was citing polling data that shows that about 
70 to 80% of diaspora Jews have some kind of positive feelings towards the state of Israel and 
Hassan was disagreeing with me even though the polls are readily available by Pew Research 
just last month showing that.
72% of diaspora Jews have some type of at least positive feelings about the state of Israel 
I was stating that fact to him and he was saying that I was wrong 
And I said ""Who are you to talk about this?"" I did not say that I only listen to Jewish people which is a little bit presumptuous and a little insane.
	
**Sam: that's not what I took him to say but that's irrelevant to me 
I think I haven't seen that poll 
I've seen ones that have said that they feel a connection either strong or not which is different than positive.
My Hebrew education was one-third Holocaust, one-third Israel, one-third Hebrew and Jewish culture. This was in the 70s, I certainly feel a strong connection to Israel but I wouldn't call it positive these days.**

E: I think what the poll attempts to do is...
If you ask Hassan or a lot of people on the left I think an emotional attachment is the way to describe this.

**Sam:  I certainly have an emotional attachment but I wouldn't describe it as positive**

 E: Dan, is there a [poll] that shows 73% of diaspora Jews? it doesn't really matter regardless 

I want to flesh out my ideas my thoughts because 
I'm being characterized by Hassan and a lot of his cohorts as being: 
a Zionist
 	pro-Israel,
an Israel apologist 
a genocide supporter 
a baby killer,
married to a baby killer

I would like to just take the opportunity to explain my ideas 
what I think about Israel and you can tell me what you think.
 because: ‚ÄúApparently, I will only listen to other Jewish people. So finally, I can speak to someone whose opinion matters to me. So thank you as the official sanctioned Jewish man Sam Seder‚Äù

I‚Äôm 100% Ashkanazi. Have you ever taken one of those [ancestry tests]?

**Sam: I haven't but I'm quite sure I have some sphartic Jewish ancestry, too 
So I‚Äôm a mix of Vilnius and Hungary I think** 

E: Good for you I think that‚Äôs always a good thing.
Let me start here by showing you a little context

**Sam: I got about an hour**

E: I'll just get into it then.  Not that it matters but let‚Äôs start here: 

*shows picture of Tim Pool*

Tim Pool recently had a wedding, can you see that?

**Sam: Did he get married?** 

E: Well he's I think he's attending a wedding Okay And he's very formally dressed except he appears to be wearing a beanie 

**Sam: I'm aware of his beanie attachment.**

E: So I don't know, I thought this was just a fine look for our good friend Tim Pool there. Very good Nice suit 

**Sam: Yeah**

E: What have you heard about me? 
I know your colleagues have an opinion.

**Sam:  I have not heard much
the only thing I really saw was in my mentions on blue sky about talking to me and I had presumed that that was it. You mentioned in the email that you‚Äôve taken a lot of grief as have people on all sides of this.
I don't actively attempt to deplatform people.
I don't think people should do that nor be swatted nor called to be fired nor have CPS sicked on them.
I just don't think that's appropriate.
I'm more interested in talking about my relationship to Zionism and my perspective on what Israel is doing and what is happening in Gaza.**

E: And I totally agree Let's just talk about the facts 

Let me start by showing you this clip
Here's my position right after October 7th and you can tell me if you have any comments on any of my positions
This was from our episode a few days after October 7th 

> video clip: Ethan (paraphrased):
> This isn't the first time I've said it and I'll say it and many more
> The cabinet is run by genocidal maniacs
>  led by Netanyahu who should 
> resign in disgrace and 
> go to prison for being a war criminal
> he's made a coalition of the most like radically conservative freaks 
> that don't represent the majority of Israelis 
> they‚Äôre hellbent on genocide frankly overtly 
> They've committed tons of war crimes in Gaza 
> including the killing of children obviously 
> because Gaza is one of the most densely populated places in the world 
> 50% of the residents are under 18 
> So when you bomb a building 
> the chances that you're killing children is pretty much 100% 
> it's [ __ ] barbaric It's unacceptable 
> It's disgusting 
> I saw videos of Palestinian dads holding his dead 5-year-old daughter.

E: that was my take right after October 7th 
And obviously that was coming off the end of me being like
I'm Israeli citizen
The morning of October 7th me and my wife were up at 3:00 a.m 
as families were calling into news stations from their safe houses 
people being burned alive with their families 
being murdered while on the phone with news 
So coming off of that emotional shock, this was my reaction.

I don't know if there's something Zionist or pro-Israel I said there 
but maybe I don't understand.

**Sam: 
I think much of what you said was true.
 I'm not sure if what we've seen Israel do in terms of Gaza is not broadly supported in Israel. I'm not seeing the body politic. 
I was doing a lot of interviews with Israeli reporters in 2023 about the protests against what  Netanyahu is doing with the judiciary. And there was a question as to whether Israelis would see that this autocracy that Netanyahu was attempting to impose on the country wasn't an extension of what was happening in places like the West Bank and in Gaza in some fashion, more so the West Bank at that time
it's hard to make an argument [for that].
I would make an imperfect analogy as to what's happening in this country:
when you talk about the Israeli population not having a problem with what's going on in Gaza
I don't see a lot of evidence of that.
There's certainly a percentage of Israelis, I know some of them, who think that Israel should stop its assault there.
 I don't see a lot of evidence that a year and a half later after you said those things that this is not the character of the vast majority of Israeli society.
I'm not necessarily convinced that they are as aware.
I've talked to people who have reported in the West Bank and they said they would go from the West Bank into Israel and the lack of awareness of what was happening in the West Bank by Israelis was shocking to them.
I can't say if the Israeli population had a full understanding of what was happening in Gaza that they wouldn't change their mind but I don't see a lot of evidence of it.**

E: So as you touched on this was made basically before the war started 
The unfortunate really tragic outcome of the war is how much it's jaded and radicalized people in Israel 
people in Israel feel isolated 
the sentiment in Israel is that the world wants the country to disappear
obviously like that's a much more nuanced conversation 
the feeling there has definitely radicalized a lot since the war started
It's gotten a lot worse


**Sam:  I mean you have this wholesale slaughter. 
in Iraq, depending on what numbers you want to look at hundreds of thousands of people.
The number of children that we killed in Iraq has been surpassed by what's happened in Gaza.
 I find it shocking to have experienced with family members, a victimization, for instance, on college campuses of Jewish students.
Looking at the totality of what's going on and to perceive the victims to be the Israeli citizenry or Jews in this country just blows my mind.**

E: People can care about two things at once 

**Sam:  absolutely** 

E: There are people who are uninvolved in the war, being victimized in a separate situation because of their Jewish identity, that's a problem don't you think?

**Sam:  Oh I do But --**

E: and you can care about two things
You can't say ""These people are ridiculous for caring about anti-semitism on college campuses because the war is happening.""
 we can care about two things 

**Sam:  100%** 

E: Obviously one is way way worse 

**Sam:  But that's the point,
 I mean one is way worse.
what's happening in Gaza.**

E: But who should tolerate being discriminated against based on their identity?
 Who wouldn't react to that?

**Sam:  I don't think that people are being victimized.
Listen anti-semitism is real.
 It was real when I was a kid 
I had pennies thrown at me growing up and playing basketball
 I've experienced anti-semitism**

**We‚Äôre both parents, if my kid is going through something very difficult 
it's obviously difficult for me 
but it's more difficult for them.**

**And it's a question of prioritizing these things. 
You can have two thoughts in your head at the same time but to center oneself or to perceive that one's victimization is sufficient to ignore the -----**

E:  I‚Äôve got to stop you because I don't know who's doing that.

**Sam: You just presented as the Israeli population feels like they're isolated and this and that.**

E: There's two different separate conversations.
There's the American Jewery who's says ‚ÄúI have nothing to do with that place‚Äù 
and the Israelis

**Sam: But in terms of how you characterized the Israeli feeling isolated etc, I can understand, that 
but to not have the first thought of  ‚Äòwe are committing genocidal acts‚Äô
genocide is a legal term but colloquially speaking it is a genocide. 
To not recognize that as the first, fundamental issue is blinkered
I don't know how else to say it. It's a little gobsmacking to me.**

E:  I agree with you that in Israel people...
I think the problem is...
On a higher level I agree with you like obviously the people in Israel compared to what's...
On October 7th they were victims and what they suffered pales in comparison to the mass destruction 
and wanton death of civilians in Gaza 

and what's happening in the West Bank too. 

I do agree with you
The media apparatus and the feeling that they have there 
There's not a lot of space emotionally that would allow them to have that kind of like self-realization
even the information that they're consuming
And like you said a lot of Israelis don't know what's happening necessarily

**Sam: There are some.**

Ethan: Yeah of course there‚Äôs some.

**Sam: The publisher of Harets spoke out about what was going on there
and there was an attempt by the government to basically shut them down to some extent.**

E: What's your explanation why Israelis don't care? 
It's not that they're evil, right? 

**Sam: There is a mass a failure to deal with trauma
 some of it is racism.
 How can you explain? 
 I just watched a clip of people at a Trump rally chanting USA 
watching a video of people being taken into that prison in El Salvador.
I don't know how I can explain that. 
So I don't know how I could explain how the Israelis are able to have that reaction 
but I know that it's wrong. 
I'm not in a position to psychoanalyze it beyond vague notion.**

E: Sure and I agree with you.

**Sam: from my perspective it's gobsmacking 
I never identified myself as a Zionist as a kid nor as an anti-zionist
it wasn't really until someone heard me articulate my perspective 
they referred to me as anti-zionist. I don't really care one way or another how I'm labeled.
It shows a failure of the system of government that Israel has.
Both from a perspective of what some people had as a notion of Zionism in the 19th century, it has been a failure in terms of keeping Jews safe.
I can't operate as someone who lives in Israel but I can operate as someone who is an American regarding what we support. 
We should end all aid. 
As a Jew who sees my religion being used as a fig leaf for what Israelis or Zionists are doing, 
that's where I'm coming from.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a psychological state that can justify this.**

E: it's just an attempt to understand not justify because I mean it is what it is, right?
It is the way that it is.
It's just trying to explain it 
That's all 
I agree with everything you're saying.

**Sam: Do you think that we should cut all aid to Israel?**

E: I think that'd be justifiable, yeah. 
And we're talking about military aid and stuff? 
Yeah for sure Israel can make their own bombs, 
They don't need the American military. 
Yeah I agree with you on that.

**Sam: They do need it to do what they're doing without a doubt.** 

E: I mean they're not entitled to it.

**Sam: No.**

E:  So yeah I think military aid should be cut for sure.

**Sam: As a Jew I take such offense to what is being done ostensibly to protect me,
my family, ancestors and progeny.
I think the conflation of Zionism and Judaism is both not keeping Jews safe and is wrong at its core
we can see what it's even doing in this country. 
It's enabled Trump to attack universities and law firms.
If you agree with that, great. If not, I'm happy to discuss it with you.**

E:  Yeah No I agree with everything you're saying .

Part of the reason why this chasm started between me and Hasan
Hasan is very influential
When he decides that somebody is an enemy of the movement for criticizing him
which is what I perceive happened
then it kind of becomes reality. 

For example one of my criticisms of him is not supporting Kamala Harris.
Would she have stopped the war? I don't know 
But I know she would have been better than Trump.
Trump's posting  this insane Gaza the Riviera with Trump hotels 
He's sending the 20 pound bombs 
He's telling Netanyahu you have a blank check to do whatever you want now 

**Sam: It just came out that Biden did nothing**

E: Well I'm talking about Kamala.

**Sam:  I suspect that she would not have had the same policies as Trump but at the same time I think that it was a massive failure both on a real human level. Had she articulated anything even remotely close to what I would hope, it would have probably had implications in the election.
More importantly it would have maybe implicated the behavior of Israel. I chose to support Harris because I perceived her as the lesser of two evils.**

E: Yeah me too and I think that that's an important distinction to make in a time like this.

**Sam: I can understand how some people were just so repulsed by what was happening that it made it almost impossible for them to vote for Harris.**

E:  I understand why they didn't.
 I totally understand the perspective of being disillusioned with this administration and not supporting Kamla.

 but at the same time a hugely influential political streamer like Hassan 
who has a huge influence on people I think 
and who's very vocal about being pro Palestine 

it's an abdication of responsibility to say ‚ÄúI'm not voting for Kamala‚Äù or ‚ÄúI'm not telling you who I voted for‚Äù 
I suspect he voted for Jill Stein personally.
He hasn't said and he wouldn't endorse her.

If you‚Äôre a random protester and say ‚ÄúI'm so disgusted I don't want to vote‚Äù that's fine.
 But if you're like a highly political streamer and have the capacity to weigh the lesser of two evils,
it's an abdication of responsibility not to do it.


**Sam: I certainly have
been critical of people who don't vote for the
lesser of two evils 
In the run-up to the 2016 election that was my perspective
But what the Biden administration was doing was so horrific that her inability to signal that there would be any change‚Ä¶
you have to take this at face value.
She would not be assaulting the government like Trump is.
this is the first election in as long as I've been doing this that 
I couldn't really condemn someone from taking that position based upon what we were seeing.**

E: It‚Äôs not just some random person. I do (condemn them) and let me tell you why.
Kamala Harris wanted a ceasefire
She stated that 
Trump said ""Finish them."" 

**Sam: Biden said ‚ÄòI want a ceasefire‚Äô too, and‚Ä¶**

E:  I'm not talking about Biden 

**Sam:  I understand. But we found out that Biden in fact did nothing to bring that about.**

E: You can talk about Biden, I'm talking about Kamala Harris, what she said.
 She was the vice president at the end of the day she doesn't really do that much 

**Sam: No, I'm talking about the candidate.
 Biden as the president said he wanted a ceasefire.
 She as a candidate said I want a ceasefire. But it -** 


E: Well, even if you're thinking, ‚ÄòI don't know how much I trust them.‚Äô One says ‚ÄòI want a ceasefire‚Äô and the other one says 'finish them‚Äô.

**Sam: It was certainly obvious to me that Trump was going to be worse but I think if you're trying to get the candidate to show some indication of this, I can understand. I wouldn't do it, I would disagree with it.**

E: But yeah I get your point too. 
I understand why people wouldn't want to support them because of what they've seen 

**Sam: It also shows a tremendous amount of electoral malfeasance on her part 
They made an active choice: to not allow that Palestinian lawmaker from Georgia on stage, to signal that they weren't going to do anything.
She would have been better on this than Trump but they were making an active choice to do that.
It was electoral malfeasance on her part.
What is the point of litigating this?**

E: We‚Äôre talking about my criticisms of Hassan.

**Sam: I honestly don‚Äôt care.**


E: You don't care, I know. And why should you? I don't blame you.
 We talked about anti-semitism compared to the destruction and everything happening in Gaza 
the humanitarian crisis in Gaza 
is way more important.

 So let me show you an example of something Hasan said.
 this isn't drama 
This is one of the biggest, most influential streamers 
spreading something really dangerous 

I'll show it to you and you tell me what you think

 (shows Hasan video)
 
> Hasan‚Äôs exact quote: 1:20:29 But in a totally just world any kind of regardless of your background any kind of fucking uh Zionist tendency should be treated in the same way as as being a fucking rabid neo-Nazi And you couldn't even you shouldn't even let someone be the fucking local dog catcher as uh as as Felix was posting. 
> If they've ever exhibited any sort of fucking, any sort of like, positive feelings about the state of Israel‚Ä¶ I'm so serious about this

E: He didn't misspeak. 
He doubled down on it yesterday. 
He said ""No I agree, that's what I think."" 

Now just to recap he says ""Anyone that's had positive feelings at any point about the state of Israel is a neo-Nazi that's not fit to be a dog walker."" 
It‚Äôs extremely dangerous dehumanizing language about: 
70% of the Jewish diaspora and 
people you know in your family

**Sam: There's some hyperbole there** 

E: That‚Äôs putting it lightly.

**Sam: But he says Zionism**

E: Sorry, I got to correct you. He says Zionism and then he says if you had positive feelings about the state of Israel at any point in your life.

**Sam:  if you look at what's happening right now and you have positive feelings about Israel‚Ä¶**

E: He said at any point in your life 

**Sam: Would I have said ‚Äúat any point in his life‚Äù? 
This is such a petty issue
what Israel is doing right now is so far beyond the idea that someone says ‚Äúany time in your life‚Äù or uh
 He's talking about Zionism
it's very difficult for me to understand how someone could have positive feelings at this time 
Now you want to say in the past and what okay
I will grant you ‚Äúat any time in your life‚Äù is too broad a statement.** 

**You‚Äôre making this about anti-semitism by 
doing this hopscotch about a poll that people had positive feelings, and then therefore he is anti-semitic 
That type of conflation is so dangerous and disingenuous.**

**I have had a guy who went to 
my bar mitzvah 
my sister's bar mitzvah 
my kids bar mitzvah 
sat at Passover with me three or four times
call my father and ask him if I'm anti-semitic 
Now this is an illustration of conflating.**

**When he's clearly talking about Zionism.
Did he use hyperbole to say ‚Äúany time in life‚Äù? Whatever 
conflation is dangerous for Jews
 It is fig leaf
a way of weaponizing anti-semitism that has 
enabled Donald Trump to do the shit he's doing
enabled the slaughter of thousands upon thousands of children and women and men 
It is not keeping Israelis safe** 

**And this type of conflation Is what I find far more irresponsible frankly than the idea that he said ‚Äúpositive any time‚Äù.
 to focus in on that one tiny clause‚Ä¶**

E: This is not one tiny clip, Sam. You don't know. This is a totality of behavior.

**Sam: But you wanted to bring this up! I don‚Äôt care about this.**

E: You‚Äôre just hand-waving it away

**Sam: No, I'm not hand waving it away I‚Äôm saying this conflation...** 

E: You kind of are. You're saying I‚Äôm wrong for caring about it.

**Sam: Yes. This conflation is incredibly dangerous and disingenuous** 


E: it's dangerous to ignore what's being described as dehumanizing violent language for American Jews

**Sam: That is a complete mischaracterization of that.**

E: It's not. ‚ÄúNot fit to be a dog walker?‚Äù

**Sam: He never says the word Jews. How many members of CUFI (Christians United for Israel) have positive feelings? It is clearly not a function of their Judaism.** 

E:  but it describes most Jews 

**Sam: No** 

E: Yes.

**Sam: It describes most Christian evangelicals too** 

E: Yes, but it also describes 73% of Jews 

**Sam: That's not anti-semitism** 

E: What do you call it when somebody's discriminating against the vast majority of a racial or religious group? 

**Sam: Look at evangelicals** 

E: I don't care about evangelical people 

**Sam: But I can say the same thing about Christian evangelicals too. It is not anti-semitism.**

E: Well, taking only one example in isolation, which is what we've done here - 

**Sam: You're the one who gave it to me! I'm using your example and in that instance that is not anti-semitism.** 

E: Well fundamentally I disagree with you.

**Sam: That's our disagreement. Conflation is incredibly dangerous**. 

E: I disagree as well

**S: It's dangerous for the jews and this society**

E: I think it's dangerous to handwave what is happening here.
 I know you said you aren't doing that

**Sam: I'm not hand waving** 

E: No you're doing the opposite You're endorsing it.

**Sam: This is a function of decades and decades of thought about this** 

E: Right, Sure.
You're saying: 
that this is not dangerous 
How dare you care about this 
Jewish people have a collective memory of trauma and
it starts a certain way and 
it starts with dehumanizing language 
like saying ‚Äúyou're not fit to walk a dog‚Äù
It's irresponsible language. 


**Sam: He‚Äôs not talking about Jews.**

E: He's talking about 73% of Jewish people 

**Sam: No, you said that.**

E:  No, that's a poll that's readily available.

**Sam:  No, you made that connection. He did not.
There are millions of members of CUFI.
We have millions of evangelicals who also believe the same thing.
You cannot say it's anti-semitism if you're also including far more
Christians than Jews.**

E:  Would you say your father ever in his life had positive feelings about the state of Israel?

**Sam: I've had positive feelings of Israel.**

E: Does your dad have any positive feelings on Israel?

**Sam: Yes I would assume so. I‚Äôve had them.**

E: Okay good. 
Then you're a neo-Nazi not fit to walk a dog.
 		How do you feel about that?

**Sam: No that's you saying that** 

E: That's literally what he said I'll play it again:
[plays Hasan clip again]

> Hasan‚Äôs exact quote: 1:20:29 But in a totally just world any kind of regardless of your background any kind of fucking uh Zionist tendency should be treated in the same way as as being a fucking rabid neo-Nazi And you couldn't even you shouldn't even let someone be the fucking local dog catcher as uh as as Felix was posting. 
> If they've ever exhibited any sort of fucking, any sort of like, positive feelings about the state of Israel‚Ä¶
> 

E: Another thing he's doing is he plays around with the term Zionist 

**Sam: You can say that's a wrong thing to say but he's not talking about Jews
He's talking about people who have exhibited these positive feelings for Israel
that includes millions more Christians than Jews.**


 E: Okay Well listen I don't think they're neo-Nazis not fit to walk dogs you know either I think it's insane language

**Sam: You don't want to tell me that you have never engaged in hyperbole You and I both are in the business.**

E: Yeah you're right. I just think that Arabs that support Israelis aren't fit to walk dog 

**Sam: You can say it‚Äôs an inappropriate, unfair thing to say. It is not anti-semitism** 

E: Okay Well we're at an impasse on this one 

**Sam: Yep**

E: So anyway another thing Hasan does is:
 he says ‚ÄúZionist tendencies‚Äù 
he's someone that plays around with Zionism 
He calls me a Zionist 
I don't think that you could accurately characterize me as that as it's used colloquially.
 You don't know.
He's saying Zionist tendencies 
What's a Zionist tendency?

**Sam: I don't know. You're going to talk to him on Friday. You can ask him what a Zionist tendency is.**

**I would guess the notion of an ethnostate that engages and allows whatever in the name of Zionism allows for this mass slaughter is horrific.**

E: Sure, Me too

**Sam: Okay. Then I think the three of us agree on that.**

E: Yeah.
 Hasan openly supports Hamas.

**Sam: Let‚Äôs not talk about Hasan.**

E: What do you want to talk about?

**Sam: If you want you can ask me about Hamas.**

E: How do you feel about Hamas?

**Sam: People can perceive it as a liberation organization. 
We call them terrorists in this country** 

E: What do you think about them? 

**Sam: I think there are parts that have done good for the people in Gaza and they have done bad things. I feel like Ehud Barack when he said on multiple occasions that ‚Äúwere I Palestinian and I was living in Gaza, it would be likely that I would join Hamas‚Äù
That is an understanding of human nature -** 

E: ..that you're not affording Israelis, by the way 
just to point out a inconsistency

**Sam: How so?**

E:  Well you say ‚ÄúI refuse to understand human nature and their reaction, It's just evil and I don't know how to explain it.‚Äù

**Sam: I didn't use the word evil** 

E: Right I'm inferring  because I asked you if you think they're evil and you didn't really answer that.  You avoided it. 

**Sam: I don‚Äôt know what Gazins felt on October 8th toward Hamas 
we have a long history of so-called terrorist organizations
the ANC
the IRA 
the PLO 
ultimately become political organizations**

E: Comparing Hamas to what happened in South Africa is insanely disingenuous.
I personally hate when people do that.

**Sam: Mandela didn't think so.**

E:  Mandela did think so 
He explicitly stated that he avoided committing violence on the citizenry
because it would make reunification impossible 
 I think that's something he said
 In the totality of their campaign under 200 civilians died 
people who did kill civilians were almost all held accountable for what they did 
That's a difference 
a significant difference 

**Sam: It is a significant difference. Many of those people who committed atrocities on October 7th are dead now** 

E: What does that have to do with anything?

**Sam: That's accountability**

E: Okay, I mean being held accountable by the party that they're doing the violence on behalf of.

**Sam: you're saying the entire ANC was held accountable?**

E:  No. In Nelson Mandela's party 
if someone killed a civilian they would 
hold them accountable 
charge them 
disavow their actions

**Sam: The ANC did?**

E: Yes 

**Sam: The IRA was bombing places in England and Ireland 
The Argun, the Stern gang, they killed over a hundred villagers in 1948** 

**History is full of examples of organizations that commit terrorist acts.
 I do not condone the killing of civilians
 which is why I'm upset about what Israel is doing** 

E: Sure. 
People sweep for Hamas by saying 
‚Äúwhat do you expect?‚Äù 
But the the truth is what South Africa shows 
you don't need to commit a violent war against civilians to liberate yourself

**Sam: for a year we had the great march of return
Sinoir himself was involved in that. 
there were Palestinians marching on a regular basis over the course of the year, 
It was around 50 innocent people
snipers shot down unarmed civilians**

**Over the course of the 20 years my attitude towards Israel's willingness to have peace and my understanding of it has changed.** 

**I can only imagine living in a place like the Warsaw ghetto
with no access to resources 
50% unemployment 
the apartheid that is taking place in terms of the West Bank** 

 E: I agree with those characterizations 

**Sam:  Okay but I can't imagine that my response wouldn't be to pick up a weapon.**

E: It's not really working out.

**Sam:  Well none of it's working out is it?**

E:  I mean not much at all Great 

**Sam: But it's called the greatest attack on Israelis in 75 years
The notion of Zionism and the way that uh Israel is organized as a society is
not protecting Jews 
not protecting Israelis 
not protecting Jews worldwide**

**There may have been a time where Zionism had 
	early 20th century/ late 19th century
there was a notion of a multithnic democracy 
that fell by the wayside 
Hannah Rent and Einstein left the Zionist Congress**

**It evolved into a nightmare for everyone involved 
And so um you know I don't know how I would react in uh in that type of miseration frankly 
but again Ehud Barack said that he would pick up a weapon were he one of them** 

E: That‚Äôs fine.

**Sam: And he‚Äôs far closer to the conflict than I am.**

E:  I'm not saying I don't understand why people pick up weapons.
What do you think about the October 7th attack? 

**Sam: it was horrific** 

E: Yes. This was a military action by Hamas to what end?

**Sam: I don't know what the strategy was.
They attacked two military bases 
I don't know if they were aware of the rave was happening
I suspect it was to derail the Abram Accords which were going to
leave the Palestinians out of the equation** 

E: you left out that they attacked Kabutim.

**Sam: Yes of course they did. But I'm saying that I don't know what the strategy was.**

E:  What do you think would you expect the response of Israel would be to that?

**Sam: I had no doubt on that day that Israel was going to respond--**

E: Go insane, right? it was going to be horrific. We all knew. Yeah

**Sam: Yes but the lack of proportionality was just beyond‚Ä¶ 
I was aware that this was going to be a horror show 
but I didn‚Äôt have the level of awareness of
that they would literally level it, 
destroy what is it 80-90% of the structures,
bomb hospitals,
use food as a weapon.**

1ke0713,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1ke0713/dreams_can_sabotage_your_life/,Dreams can sabotage your life.,"Most people's passions involve easygoing work like art, coffee, or other comfortable pursuits that you many aspire to do.

Those who grew up in genuine poverty and managed to escape typically did so by engaging in challenging jobs. Careers like becoming an electrician, working in engineering, accounting, sewage treatment, engineering, or concrete are demanding but offer high pay prospects. It's these uncomfortable, high-paying jobs that often lead to better circumstances.

Dreams can sometimes sabotage us. Many don't realize this until years later. We're constantly encouraged to follow our dreams, but dreams are appealing because they depend entirely on us, and the world doesn't always align with them.

When you focus solely on your dream job, you might unknowingly sabotage yourself. Every job, even the high-paying ones seem undesirable because you're comparing them to your dream. That dream can prevent you from recognizing the valuable opportunities right in front of you. Maybe theirs a job opportunity in a electrical apprenticeship or maybe your father is helping you get a job at the company he works for. 

I am not saying to give up on your dreams, you just do it on the side. It‚Äôs better to afford your hobbies and eat 3 meals a day than penny pinch and dream. ",5,1746298251.0,GenZ,6,0.78,False

I vowed from that point that I would never let myself be treated poorly.

Almost exactly a year later I meet a girl who seems completely opposite in terms of lifestyle and things like that (doesn't drink, party, no social media etc) and I thought it was amazing at first but now I'm starting to feel as though I might have ignored a lot of early signs.

I met her once through a mutual friend, and then ran into her at the gym a month later and she lingered around me waiting for me to finish so I could give her a ride home.  She sort of inserted herself into my life.

She seemed to have very low social awareness around who was interested in her and who wasn't so I made it very clear I wasn't wanting to hang out just to be friends.

We started getting closer, we have made out and done other things but she wants to wait for sex.  She also doesn't want to go on dates, has a really hard time with eye contact and is scared to spend the night after after almost 3 months even though she's already done so before, she says its different if it just happens vs planning it because that's scary.   We have been hanging out almost every day till late at night, but she won't spend the night.

She also continuously questions my intentions, is obsessed with knowing everything about every girl I've ever dated keeps looping back to the fear of me breaking up with her soon because I'm ""a player"" and I can't seem to break the 3 month mark.  She also says that I never ask her to hang out first or that I never text her first which is simply not true.  She is just continuously doubting that I'm serious about her. The other day she said that I just ""wasn't a serious person"".  It seems like she's constantly trying to disqualify me as worthy of her love because she's scared to get close.

She also still has stuff going on with her ex of 5 years and high school sweetheart, it's been a year but he still tries to contact her regularly.  She ended up calling him two weeks ago and I was heart broken so I ended things, but then we ended up getting back together last week. (this is mostly my doing and I know this).  She frequently talks about him and their life together to the point where it felt like everything was just a comparison.  She told me she was just coming out of that darkness when she met me. 

She communicates poorly and often makes me wait for her, the other night she asked me to hang out at 7pm but was with friends till 10pm and didn't text me to let me know at all. When I let her know it wasn't nice to make me wait on her all night when she specifically told me she would be free at 7pm, she began raising her voice and blaming it on me not showing enough interest in the beginning.

The next morning she brought me coffee and a cinnamon bun from my favorite coffee shop to apologize, she told me she felt like she had been taking me for granted.

The whole thing is bringing about an anxious attachment style in me that has only been there once before...when I dated the girl with BPD.

She is out of town this weekend and I have been so anxious about what she is going to be up to and then I started thinking about all of this stuff. My gut just tells me something is not right.  I have barely messaged her because I would rather just not think about what she's up to.

As I type this out and read it back it seems painfully obvious that this is no good whether she has BPD or not.   I guess part of me thinks if it's not BPD she can work on things more than if she does have it...but i don't think that really matters.

1ke04k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1ke04k3/loneliness/,Loneliness,"Hi. I'm sorry if a post of this kind has been made already. I just need to vent. 

I'm a college student. A very small college, very few people. I've tried meeting people from other colleges and made a few acquaintances which I regretted. Many people around me are addicted to screens and videogames and social media. Lots of my ""relationships"" with people were just sending reels on instagram. But I wanted real life connections to which my ""friends"" would always reply with ""we're introverts we cannot go out"". So i got rid of them. And then got more ""friends"" of the same kind.

  
Nobody wants to go out. I cannot grab a coffee with a friend and talk about my day. I can only text them. They always say how they are not in the mood or how they ""need to study"" but fail their exams nonetheless. I, on the other hand, have numerous hobbies, and while it can get exhausting to always be busy during the week, it's much better than having nothing to do. But I still manage to get time to study. And I have free time on weekends but I spend it in solitude, listening to music. 

  
I crave more human interactions but I cannot get them. People around me are asocial. I believe I deserve better friends but I don't know how to get them. This kind of ""friendship"" makes me feel frustrated and depressed so I cut off those people for good in order to preserve my mental health. But then I get backslash for my parents who tell me that ""cutting people off is immoral and nobody in the world does it except for me"". 

I became scared of asking people to spend time with me. I've began to view it as selfish since they have their own private lives and I'm asking them to give me their own free time. I've been rejected by people who presented themselves as my friends so many times that it starts to feel like the universe does not want me to socialize.

1ke00ka,https://i.redd.it/0s1todpu3mye1.jpeg,Wednesday and Tyler's first meeting was a Foreshadow?,"Hey everyone! This is my very first post in this community, and I'm slightly (read: totally) obsessed with Wednesday and Tyler‚Äîto the point that I've rewatched the show just for these two more times than I can count. Cause something about them is so different, so amazing that honestly I've never seen in other couples.

Anyway, I wanted to share a theory I've been turning over in my head over a year‚Äîespecially after rewatching Wednesday Season 1, Episode 1. I noticed how incredibly intentional the coffee shop meet-cute between Wednesday and Tyler was. People who brush it off as just a charming intro moment are missing major foreshadowing. That entire interaction is layered with double meanings, metaphors, and low-key emotional groundwork for their future dynamic.

I'll try to break it down (and yes, this is gonna be detailed because I‚Äôve overanalyzed this scene like it‚Äôs my job):


1. The Symbolism of the Coffee Machine = Tyler Himself

When Tyler says, *""It's a temperamental beast with a mind of its own,""* he's literally describing his Hyde side‚Äîsomething wild and uncontrollable.

""Temperamental beast"" = Hyde.
Tyler‚Äôs Hyde form is literally a beast that he can‚Äôt control at this point in the story. The phrase ""mind of its own"" reflects how Hyde instincts take over and he loses control.
This line subtly foreshadows that Tyler‚Äôs ""beast"" will eventually be unleashed. So this was already foreshadow that Tyler is the Monster which was later revealed in finale.

Tyler: *""And it doesn‚Äôt help that the instructions are in Italian.""*
This represents Tyler‚Äôs lack of understanding of his own Hyde nature. Just like the machine‚Äôs instructions are in a foreign language, he doesn‚Äôt understand himself or his monster side yet.
Translation: He is lost, confused, and doesn‚Äôt know how to ""fix"" himself.

And this is where it gets really juicy...


2. Wednesday as the One Who ""Fixes"" Him

Wednesday: *""I need a tri-wing screwdriver and a four-millimeter Allen wrench.""*

She doesn‚Äôt hesitate. She immediately knows how to fix it.

Just like she fixes the coffee machine, this foreshadows her being the one who ""fixes"" Tyler.
The fact that she diagnoses the problem so quickly suggests that, deep down, she will also understand his monster side better than anyone else.


Tyler: *""Wait, you read Italian?""*

In this moment, Tyler realizes Wednesday has skills that go beyond the surface.
This mirrors his own arc‚Äîhe seems ""normal"" on the surface but has hidden depths and darkness inside.
Wednesday reading Italian is symbolic of her being able to ""read"" or understand Tyler better than others. (Plus, of course Wednesday reads Italian. Probably while dangling upside down from a gargoyle lol.)


3. This one's my favorite ""Do You Have One of These Monsters at Home?"" = Tyler eventually Becoming Part of Her Family

Tyler: *""Where? You have one of these monsters at home?""*

At first glance, this sounds like a casual joke. But in hindsight, it‚Äôs a massive foreshadowing moment. (Or maybe it's just me being delulu)
But seriously Wednesday doesn‚Äôt even deny it‚Äîinstead, she answers with something personal.

Wednesday: *""Steam-powered guillotine. I built it when I was ten. I wanted to decapitate my dolls more efficiently.""*

This means she‚Äôs always been drawn to ""fixing"" things in dark, twisted ways.
Just like she ""fixed"" the coffee machine and her dolls, she will ""fix"" Tyler‚Äînot by changing him but by helping him control his Hyde.

And the mention of ""home""? That‚Äôs important. It hints that Tyler (a ""monster"") will eventually be part of her home‚Äîher family. That one line hits harder on the rewatch than a raven slamming into a stained-glass window.


4. Why This Scene Was Included in Their Very First Meeting

Let‚Äôs be real: writers don‚Äôt waste precious screen time in pilot episodes on random scenes.
The coffee machine repair = a metaphor for Tyler and Wednesday‚Äôs entire arc.

She fixes his machine ‚Üí She will fix his brokenness.

He asks if she has a monster at home ‚Üí He will become the monster in her life.


For me This wasn‚Äôt just quirky small talk‚Äîit was a blueprint for their entire relationship.


So What Was Going On in the Writers‚Äô Minds?

It‚Äôs clear the writers were setting up a twisted, fate-bound connection from the start. The coffee shop wasn‚Äôt just a cute backdrop‚Äîit was thematic gold.
Why a broken coffee machine? Because it had to be a ""temperamental beast."" It had to reflect Tyler. And it had to be fixed by Wednesday.
The metaphor is too clean, too intentional to be accidental.

They knew when series will end fans would come back and rewatch and go, ‚ÄúWait a second... this was the moment it all started.‚Äù
And if you do go back and rewatch it (again, like me), you‚Äôll catch how precise and deliberate every line is.


The Endgame Vibe

This whole sequence supports the theory that Tyler is endgame because his entire arc revolves around his struggle between his monstrous nature and his humanity‚Äîand Wednesday is the only one who can truly understand and balance both sides.
Plus let‚Äôs be honest: if Wednesday Addams is going to end up with someone, it‚Äôs not going to be basic or conventional. She needs someone dark, twisted, broken and complex‚Äîand Tyler, her literal monster, is the only one who fits.
 
I had this theory since on my second time rewatch of S1 I didn't posted cause it sounded kinda delusional but now After seeing teaser of S2 I think this might be very possible there's definitely something going on we don't know yet, I do believe Wednesday might be Tyler's master and tbh if she'll be, he's already going to be fixed.

I just hope this gave you something to think about‚Äîor at least made you want to rewatch their first meeting scene like it‚Äôs a prophecy. Let me know your thoughts about it or if you noticed other moments like this or have any doubts about this.

It ends well and we keep talking the rest of last week, once or twice a day or when she‚Äôs out at a bar or at a friends house keeping each other company till she sleeps and I appreciate being her safe buddy and all when she‚Äôs out.

This past Monday tho I got drunk and accidentally butt dialed her late night and she woke up 6am texting me if I was ok and why did I call her and then I did the unthinkable and tell her that maybe I wanted her to teleport to me in my dreams and then passed out hungover for a couple hours. She doesn‚Äôt text back for over a day then after lets me know she appreciates me and thinks I‚Äôm nice but that sometimes my comments are flirty and she wants to clear up any mixed signals and that she appreciates our friendship. I freak out and overapologize saying sorry and that I get carried away but that I know it‚Äôs not fair and I always appreciated being a good friend to her and would never want to lose that.

Then the next night while I was out at a club trying to move on after bed rotting in shame all Wednesday and Thursday, she DMs me a meme of our favorite band together on Instagram.

Just some backstory - there wasn‚Äôt any sort of cheating, it was simply because things didn‚Äôt work out - and also because we ended up long distance for more than seven months.

Now the twist - I was getting done with my training, and maybe, a just a small part of me, was getting ready to move on.

The day - I was so fucking anxious. Still, I put on my best self and decided to wait for her to text. No texts in the morning. (Ofc I was kidding myself, why on earth would would she have the need to acknowledge me). ‚ÄúLunch break, for sure, she will text‚Äù. Nope, no sir.

To clarify, the wait wasn‚Äôt for reconciliation - it was just to confront this anxiety, to see an old friend, to bid adieu in the nicest way possible, to put bandages to an open wound that might never be closed.

She had seen another friend of mine in the break. That gave me an ache.
I decided to text her as the day was almost getting over. ‚ÄúAm in cabin C, will see you‚Äù. I waited outside the cabin, heart thumping, blood rushing, hands all cold. I saw her through the glass. She was with a couple of friends (from college). She was happy, I guess.

Now, there she comes. ‚ÄúHello‚Äù. (hello, stranger). She talked as if she met me for the first time, and as if I was a sales associate knocking on her door to desperately sell some books.
‚ÄúCan we have coffee?‚Äù. 
‚ÄúSorry, there‚Äôs a brother of mine, Rahul, coming to see me. He works in infopark‚Äù. 
Why wouldn‚Äôt I know you have a brother? Why wouldn‚Äôt I know his name? Why wouldn‚Äôt I know he works here? 
The tone, the unfamiliarity, everything together was so much for me to handle. I left the place, a tear in my eye, disguised with my glasses on.

1kdzkvr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdzkvr,Abandoned Basement Level of former Forever 21 at Mall of America,"At the Mall of America (MOA), there were four anchor stores at each cardinal direction. There still are, but one of them used to be Sears. When that went belly up, that anchor flailed around for a bit, before Forever 21 took up the basement, ground, and second floors. But Forever 21 couldn't hack it, so the ground and second floor became something else (the third floor has been a Crayon Experience for a while now).

Currently, the only use of the basement level is... pick-up spot to receive Toys For Tots cardboard drop-off boxes from the Marines in December. 

That's right, the only thing I can figure this large, empty space is for is getting supplies for a yearly charitable venture. A gigantic, living mall a story higher, where storefronts stay empty for a remarkably short amount of time, a thriving theme park, a movie theater, an indoor go-kart track, two attached major-brand hotels, legitimate office space, an expansive aquarium with glass tunnels where fish can swim above you, a Claire's and a Caribou Coffee on every floor, and a Cinnebon that's been there since DAY ONE, and... a haunted void of nothing but the faint memory of young adulthood and ""the party starts with me and will go until the heat death of the universe.""

It's beautifully eerie and liminal, but the illusion is shattered by a uniformed USAF Marine with a clip board keeping track of what organizations are taking cardboard boxes, and whatever music he's playing on a Bluetooth speaker to break up the boredom of technically being on duty in a ghost house.

Okay, friends, let‚Äôs get real for a second. How many of us are running at full speed, juggling work, gym sessions, side hustles, and maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîtrying to maintain a social life? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre all on this never-ending treadmill of achievement, and sometimes it feels great! Other times... not so much. You might even feel that *tightness* in your chest like you just chugged a bottomless iced coffee and forgot to breathe. Sound familiar? 

Here‚Äôs a little secret: sometimes you gotta pump the brakes to get back on track. Enter my newest *‚Äúuseless‚Äù ritual*. Yep, it sounds counterintuitive, but stick with me here.

**What is this magical 5-minute ritual?** *Drumroll, please‚Ä¶* It‚Äôs allowing yourself to do absolutely *nothing*! üò≤

Now before you roll your eyes and think this is just some fluff, hear me out. 

### Here‚Äôs What This Looks Like:
- **Find a comfy spot**: A couch? A park bench? Your bed? Just make sure it‚Äôs somewhere you feel good.
- **Set a timer for 5 minutes**: No checking your phone, no scrolling through the latest memes. Just... sit.
- **Focus on your breath**: Inhale through your nose for a count of 4, hold for 4, exhale through your mouth for 6. 
- **Let your thoughts wander**: It‚Äôs okay if your mind goes to that grocery list or that project due next week. Just acknowledge those thoughts and let them drift away. 

Seriously, though, how often do we allow ourselves this luxury? Here‚Äôs the kicker: after those 5 minutes, you‚Äôll probably feel like you just had a mini-vacation. ‚òÄÔ∏è 

### You might be wondering, ‚ÄúWhy does this even matter?‚Äù 
- **Recharges your brain**: Think of it as giving your overworked gray matter a spa treatment. 
- **Boosts creativity**: Some of my best ideas hit me right after I take a mind break. 
- **Helps with decision fatigue**: Too many choices lead to burnout, so clearing your head helps you see things more clearly.

Let‚Äôs be honest, we often romanticize the grind. But if we keep pushing, we miss out on the good stuff‚Äîlike actually enjoying our successes and feeling fulfilled. 

And I can hear some of you saying, ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt have time for this!‚Äù Here's the thing: we *make* time for what matters. What‚Äôs more important? The endless hustle, or finding that joy and clarity that‚Äôs going to fuel your next achievement? 

So, next time you find yourself spiraling into that hyper-achieving mode, take this little time-out. üõë You might just surprise yourself by leveling up in ways you didn‚Äôt expect.

1kdzcyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1kdzcyw/the_simple_truth_about_social_anxiety_and_how_you/,The Simple Truth About Social Anxiety - And How You Can Build Confidence From Within [tool],"I want to share something powerful that will change how you see social anxiety forever.

Think about it - how many times have you:

* Been told to ""just be yourself"" ''Just do it''
* Tried forcing yourself to be more social
* Practiced conversation ""techniques""
* Read endless tips about body language
* Pushed yourself out of your comfort zone

And yet... nothing really changed. Maybe you had moments of feeling better, but then fell right back into the same patterns.

Why?

Because all these methods focus on the OUTSIDE, when the real cause of social anxiety is on the INSIDE.

‚Äé

# The Hidden Truth About Social Anxiety

The reality is - social anxiety isn't actually about ""lack of social skills"" or ""not knowing what to say.""

It's about RESISTANCE (wanting for things to be different than the way they are).

Your brain is designed to protect you from pain and danger. And it does this based on what it has learned through past experiences (your beliefs and memories).

Think back to your early experiences:

* That time you said something ""wrong"" and everyone laughed
* When you felt rejected or excluded
* Times you were judged or criticized
* Moments you felt ""not good enough""

Each of these experiences created a memory in your subconscious mind. A belief about what social situations mean.

Now, years later... whenever you're in a social situation, your mind remembers all those painful associations. And begins to create anxiety to protect you from potential pain.

This is why you:

* Overthink what to say
* Worry about being judged
* Feel your mind going blank
* Get physical anxiety symptoms
* Avoid social situations

Your mind is trying to move you away from what it perceives as danger.

‚Äé

# Why Most Social Advice Fails

Most social skills advice completely misses this crucial point.

They tell you to:

* Practice small talk
* Use eye contact
* Work on body language
* Push through the fear
* Use conversation techniques

But here's the problem - if you have limiting beliefs about social situations being painful or dangerous... your subconscious mind will ALWAYS create resistance.

It's like trying to drive with the handbrake on. You can push the gas pedal harder (force yourself to be social), but you'll never drive smoothly until you release the brake (change the limiting beliefs).

The key is understanding that you may have limiting beliefs about:

* Not being good enough
* Being judged
* Making mistakes
* Speaking up not being safe
* Not belonging
* Being different/weird

These beliefs create your social anxiety... influence your thoughts... drive your emotions... and determine your actions.

‚Äé

# How Beliefs Control Everything

Your beliefs shape:

**1.  Your Perceptions:**

* How you interpret social situations
* What you notice about others' reactions
* How you think others see you

**2.  Your Emotions:**

* Anxiety levels in social situations
* How comfortable you feel expressing yourself
* Your emotional reactions to others

**3.  Your Actions:**

* What you say and do
* How naturally you express yourself
* Whether you avoid or engage socially

**4.  Your Results:**

* The connections you create
* How others respond to you
* Your social experiences

‚ÄéI've worked with and helped hundreds of people to transform their social anxiety by addressing the root cause - their limiting beliefs. And the key to lasting change was always improving the perception (not perspective) of themselves and beliefs about the world.

I even had one student who had such severe anxiety he couldn't order coffee or walk past people without saying 'sorry'. After we changed his limiting self-beliefs and around social situations... within 30 days he was comfortably speaking with people, connecting with new people, even expressing his true self in front of others.

‚Äé

# The Process of Transformation

Here's the step-by-step process to permanently transform social anxiety:

**1. Identify Your Limiting Beliefs**

* Notice what thoughts come up in social situations
* What do you fear might happen?
* What painful memories come to mind?
* What do you believe about yourself socially?

**2. Find Evidence Against These Beliefs**

* Look for times you were social without anxiety
* Moments you connected easily with others
* Times you expressed yourself naturally
* Situations where you felt comfortable

**3. Create New Evidence Daily**

* Focus on positive social experiences
* Notice when interactions go well
* Collect proof that contradicts old beliefs
* Build new positive associations

**4. Reinforce for 21-30 Days**

* Review your evidence daily
* Keep collecting new positive proof
* Let your mind build new neural pathways
* Allow the old beliefs to fade

‚Äé

# What Actually Changes

When you transform these limiting beliefs, something amazing happens:

\- Words flow naturally without overthinking... you stop worrying about what other people think (judgement, being good enough)... all the physical symptoms of anxiety fade... you begin to feel free to be your true self and be okay with it... others see that and begin to always respond positively to you... respect you... and making connections... meeting people begins to feel good.

How come? Because your mind no longer see's potentials of pain, and instead finds evidence to support your positive belief about yourself and how certain experiences feel.

You're no longer fighting against subconscious resistance.

You're aligned - wanting to connect AND feeling safe to do so.

‚Äé

# The Social Skills Part

Once you've changed those limiting beliefs, certain social skills become natural:

**1. Authentic Expression**

* You begin to say what you actually think, share how you really feel, express your opinions and feel comfortable with your personality and who you are.

**2. Natural Connection**

* You listen to other people without stress and anxiety, respond naturally, communicate from a positive, abundant place, building connection and conversation effortlessly.

**3. Confident Presence**

* You naturally maintain comfortable eye contact, becoming more present and out of your mind, speaking with conviction and self-assurance, naturally falling into a comfortable, secure and attractive body language that communicates your strong feelings inside-out.

These aren't ""techniques"" you have to practice. They flow naturally when you're not fighting against what is happening outside of you, that you don't want to happen. You become like you once were, comfortable to be you.

‚Äé

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Don't try to ""fake it till you make it""**

* This creates more internal conflict and you mind knows it's fake. Others can sense the incongruence, because we all feel empathy and can feel what people are REALLY communicating. This is what makes us watch movies and begin to feel how the main character feels, even to a point where we lose ourselves.

**2. Don't force yourself to be more social**

* This reinforces that it's not natural, creates more resistance and builds negative associations to where it can be associated with pain, and you'll run from it even more, need to escape it, or even create limiting self-image.

**3. Don't judge yourself for having anxiety**

* This creates more limiting beliefs, to self-associate that it's something you 'have', rather than just something you 'feel'. It adds another layer of resistance, and desire to be accepted for 'having' this problem. So that nobody see's us as - different. Making transformation and ability to overcome even harder, when we self-identify with more problems, or even convince ourselves that it's permanent.

‚Äé

# The Path Forward

The reality is - you were born socially free. Watch any child... they express themselves naturally without fear.

Your social anxiety came from experiences that created limiting beliefs. Change those beliefs... and you return to your natural state of social freedom.

Remember - you're not broken and you don't lack social skills. You just have some old programming that needs to be updated.

When you transform those limiting beliefs, everything else falls into place naturally.",14,1746296077.0,GetMotivated,3,0.69,False

Lattes and iced lattes should not contain sugar..  this is how literally how every other coffee shop in the world works.

If I want to customize it by adding sugar, I will tell you.  Stop automatically adding it to everything.

Thank your coming to my Ted Talk ",1,1746296056.0,TimHortons,18,0.53,False

Not the first time when I'm gonna be doing a job like that but with more experience more questions pop out in my head.

Right now one thing I'm anxious about is being called out for not knowing something, like ""how can you not know, you're the manager sooo?"". I was thinking about a good response to that and absolutely no clue. Can I get some advice please?",1,1746296048.0,LifeAdvice,4,1.0,False

In the last couple of months however, it sometimes dispenses a way smaller amount of liquid than I set it to. E.g. I dispense 180 ml of coffee, but it ends up being 130. often it will fix itself after a while - there is no consistency. Any suggestions of what I can try and exchange to make it work reliably again?",1,1746296037.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

She drinks like 5 cups a day it is always hot with hazelnut coffee creamer. Can anyone recommend something to put in coffee to get similar taste that does not totally suck? She is having a really rough time right now with this and hip pain. She is getting a hip replacement and I would really like to give her a little bit of comfort and normalcy. Thank you all.,3,1746295967.0,diabetes,12,1.0,False
