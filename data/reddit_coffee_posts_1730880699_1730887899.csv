1gkv7x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalNomadTurkiye/comments/1gkv7x9/turkish_language_basics_for_digital_nomads/,Turkish Language Basics for Digital Nomads 🇹🇷📖,"Learning a few basic Turkish phrases can make a big difference in your daily interactions and help you feel more connected to the local culture. While many people in Türkiye’s major cities speak some English, knowing a bit of Turkish will show respect and can make life easier as you navigate daily tasks. Here are some essential words and phrases every digital nomad should know!



**1. Basic Greetings and Introductions**

* Merhaba – Hello
* Günaydın – Good morning
* İyi akşamlar – Good evening
* İyi geceler – Good night
* Hoş geldiniz – Welcome
* Response: Hoş bulduk – ""We feel welcomed"" (said in response to ""Hoş geldiniz"")
* Adım \[Your Name\] – My name is \[Your Name\]
* Tanıştığımıza memnun oldum – Nice to meet you

Tip: Starting any conversation with a friendly ""Merhaba"" goes a long way. Turkish people appreciate it when foreigners make an effort to speak their language, even if it’s just the basics!



**2. Essential Phrases for Everyday Situations**

* Teşekkür ederim / Teşekkürler – Thank you
* Lütfen – Please
* Evet / Hayır – Yes / No
* Affedersiniz – Excuse me / I’m sorry
* Bir şey değil – You’re welcome / No problem
* Yardım eder misiniz? – Can you help me?
* Anlamıyorum – I don’t understand
* İngilizce konuşuyor musunuz? – Do you speak English?

Tip: Using “Lütfen” (please) and “Teşekkür ederim” (thank you) can help you come across as polite and respectful, which is highly valued in Turkish culture.



**3. Ordering Food and Drinks**

* Menü alabilir miyim? – Can I have the menu?
* Su alabilir miyim? – Can I have water?
* Bir çay, lütfen – A tea, please
* Bir kahve, lütfen – A coffee, please
* Hesap lütfen – The bill, please
* Ne önerirsiniz? – What do you recommend?

Tip: Turkish dining often involves tea (çay) and coffee (kahve), so knowing these words will be especially helpful. Also, “Hesap lütfen” is essential when you’re ready to pay.



**4. Getting Around: Transportation and Directions**

* Nereye gidiyor? – Where is this going?
* Burası neresi? – Where is this place?
* \[Location\] nasıl giderim? – How do I get to \[Location\]?
* Yakın mı? – Is it close?
* Durdurun lütfen – Stop, please
* Kaç para? – How much?

Tip: While Türkiye has a reliable public transportation system, taxis and minibuses (dolmuş) are common as well. Knowing a few key phrases can help you navigate more confidently.



**5. At Home and in Daily Life**

* Ev – House / Home
* Anahtar – Key
* Kapı – Door
* Wi-Fi şifresi nedir? – What is the Wi-Fi password?
* Elektrik – Electricity
* İnternet var mı? – Is there internet?

Tip: When renting an apartment or staying in an Airbnb, these words will be helpful for basic interactions with hosts or neighbors.



**6. Shopping and Bargaining**

* Kaç lira? – How much is it?
* İndirim var mı? – Is there a discount?
* Bu ne kadar? – How much is this?
* Çok pahalı – Too expensive
* Daha ucuz var mı? – Do you have something cheaper?
* Beğendim – I like it

Tip: Bargaining is common in markets and some small shops, but it’s less common in larger stores. Knowing these phrases can help you negotiate politely.



**7. Numbers and Simple Expressions**

* Bir – One
* İki – Two
* Üç – Three
* Dört – Four
* Beş – Five
* On – Ten
* Yüz – One hundred
* Bin – One thousand

Tip: Numbers are essential, especially when it comes to shopping or asking for directions. Even a basic understanding of Turkish numbers can be surprisingly helpful.



**8. Common Expressions and Small Talk**

* Nasılsınız? – How are you? (formal)
* Response: İyiyim, teşekkür ederim – I’m good, thank you.
* Nerelisiniz? – Where are you from?
* Ne iş yapıyorsunuz? – What do you do?
* Hava çok güzel bugün – The weather is very nice today

Tip: “Kolay gelsin” is a very common expression you can use with anyone working—shopkeepers, taxi drivers, and even baristas. It’s a nice way to show respect and friendliness.



Mastering these basic phrases can make your time in Türkiye more enjoyable and help you connect with locals. Even if you only learn a few words, your efforts will be appreciated and can make daily interactions smoother.

1gkv5n7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gkv5n7,I don’t know where to put the couch,"I need help figuring out a layout for my living room. I just moved from a very small apartment so I didn’t have a full size couch. My new place has a longer living room, so I’m trying to figure out where to place the couch without blocking the glass too much. 

I included pictures of possible layouts I’ve thought of. The couch in the middle is closer to the TV and allows people to walk straight into a seated position from the entryway. But then there’s this awkward space behind the couch that isn’t good for much. I could also just throw it to the back wall, but I don’t know what to do with all the space in the center it would create.

The only other way I could think of is the second layout pictured, having the couch in the center but facing the glass. But then you have to walk around the couch just to sit on it. 

Open to suggestions on anything you think might tie it all together!

Things I know I need:
- Larger TV
- Entertainment system
- Rug
- Wall decor

Of note:
- The windows aren’t sliding doors. It’s a European home, so the doors inconveniently open inwards (and only the inside ones, the glass closest to the walls don’t open at all). I don’t want the long part of the couch against that side because it would block the path to the patio.
- The TV can’t fit between the glass doors because they would open into it (the hinges are towards the light switches). 
- For reference, the coffee table is a lift top, which is why I have that at the center rather than an ottoman.
- The cat tree can go to another room. It’s just there until it finds a better spot.",1,1730887558.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

For like 6-8 months we even had intimate moments together, she always was telling me she likes me but that in the way I like her. Still we got something, we hang out even several nights in row. But it wasn’t dating.

After she got little bit distant from me. We are still texting every day, from morning to night, but we are not hanging out at all now. I noticed that if I don’t suggest some plans she will not do it by herself. I decided to stop asking to spend time together and it’s over a month since we have been out last time… but it wasn’t like this before. There were times she was asking me to come for coffee, move etc. 

But I am getting  very jealous every time she tell she was on dinner with her friend, or they went for drink or even she just hang out at their/her place. I know it’s not healthy. And I have zero right to feel like that. Also is really red flag and I don’t like it on myself. She even sometimes notice when I make face unintentionally or just ask with weird tone and start saying “Stop being jealous all the time” with smile on her face so I don’t think she is angry. Or maybe she just doesn’t care.

As the title says, I am looking for suggestions for Asian restaurants in the city.

My husband loves spicy food, but I have IBS (PDS for Dutch readers) and spicy food gives me a broad range of nasty symptoms, usually for days on end. However, that means we hardly ever make anything spicy at home, and as a consequence, my husband rarely eats spicy food. Hence, I am hoping to find a restaurant where he can sate his desire for mouth-burn while I avoid functioning like a coffee machine.

**YouTube Review Link & Methodology Summary:**

[**https://youtu.be/Q8\_2NCNSAlc**](https://youtu.be/Q8_2NCNSAlc)

If you recognise me from this sub or more YouTube, you'll know that all of my reviews contain binaural sound and ANC samples, as well as frequency response measurements. These review elements, I hope, add a layer of objectivity to the key aspects of the review alongside my own subjective thoughts.

**INTRO**

Until now, Moondrop haven't quite yet been able to emulate their success in the IEM market into their TWS offerings, with their high-profile releases, including the Space Travel and Ultrasonic, showing both their strengths and weaknesses in a product and price segment that has recently been dominated by tech manufacturers branching away from their core business of mobile phones (Realme, Oppo, OnePlus, etc) or those original wireless players that have churned out dozens more releases and have perhaps had more opportunity to hone their craft, notably SoundPEATS, Soundcore and QCY.

Despite the Space Travel being an unprecedented success, with textbook tuning brought to a sub $25 set, more discerning buyers lamented their low maximum volume, connectivity issues, weak ANC, disappointing battery life and difficulty disconnecting from devices, not to mention the open charge case that divided opinion and ropey app support that disappeared as quickly as it arrived.

2024 has been a prolific year for Moondrop, with the Golden Ages, Block and Ultrasonic all arriving over the last few months, all demonstrating gradual signs of improvement, but none have been able to address the issue of bringing strong, hybrid ANC without compromising audio integrity. Their latest attempt, the Moca, doesn't just set out to do that, it also brings some really nice innovations you don't always see at this price ($50), including photo-sensors for both wear detection and automatic transparency mode upon single earbud removal, a modified duct design to lessen the impact of wind, wireless charging, customisable controls and support for LE audio courtesy of the LC3 codec, not to mention the promise of great audio with the same drivers used here as those in the Aria 2.

**Design, Fit and Comfort**  
Moondrop seem to have a very set design brief, with the earbuds and case both looking very familiar alongside their brothers and sisters! The case, while somewhat Soviet-bloc inspired in its aesthetics, now includes a proper lid with good hinge friction, though those with larger fingers might find bud extraction slightly cramped.

The case has a handy 'Quick disconnect' via button on the bottom, which compensates to a degree for the lack of multipoint connectivity - a notable omission and possibly a deal-breaker for some users. It is charged either wirelessly or via a USB-C port located alongside the red button.

The Moca maintains Moondrop's typical stem-based design, with an almost-identical stem length to the Block and Ultrasonic before it. It looks and feels a bit bulky and cumbersome compared to the sleeker, more slimline offerings from the likes of OnePlus, Soundpeats and QCY.  
The slightly oval-shaped tips should provide a satisfactory seal for most users, though some adjustment may be needed periodically for optimal fit. Stability testing showed excellent results, passing the 100 jumping jacks test easily. However, running performance was mixed, with occasional popping sounds in my left ear, due to the size of my ear canal on that ear being slightly too small for the Medium tips, but slightly too big for the Small size. The standardized nozzle size does at least allow for third-party tip compatibility (unlike the oversized nozzles on the likes of Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, for example) but I haven't found any yet that improve upon the stock.

**ANC & Transparency**

The Moca features improved hybrid ANC using both feed-forward and feedback microphones, plus an acoustic duct for better wind noise handling. It definitely shows, with the Moca working well in both commuting and every-day busy indoor environments. Subjectively, it is very quickly evident that they've souped up the ANC strength, and obectively, testing showed over 30% improvement in noise reduction compared to the Ultrasonic, placing it in the top 10 of sub-$100 ANC performance.

It performs particularly well in lower frequencies, and whilst mid-range performance is slightly behind competitors like the Earfun Air 2 NC or Air Pro 4, it was better than I expected and still very credible.

I tested the ANC along with a few competitor products, using binaural simulated ears in a busy coffee shop, and recorded the following average noise reduction figures:

KZ Xtra - 36dB  
**Moondrop Moca - 31dB**  
Earfun Air 2NC - 31 dB  
QCY MeloBuds Pro - 30dB  
KZ Carol - 29dB  
Moondrop Ultrasonic/Space Travel - 24dB

You've got some control over ANC in the app, although not a lot. You can modify the order through which modes are toggled, removing ANC off if you'd rather just keep ANC on and Transparency. There's no strength settings or mode customization, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're usage is fairly routine. There's no adaptive mode, which is a shame.

Transparency mode, while natural-sounding, struggles with detailed reproduction of nearby conversations compared to some competitors, and the lack of obvious venting means you don't get that automatic open feeling that the likes of Apple's Airpod Pro 2 is so majestic at achieving,

**Sound**

The Moca uses the same 10mm ceramic dome diaphragm dynamic drivers as the Aria 2, and it delivers a balanced and musical presentation that not only improves upon the Space Travel, but is amongst the most enjoyable of the 80+ sub $100 sets I've tested over the last five years.

Key audio characteristics include:

* Less emphasis on bass compared to typical budget TWS
* Fast, punchy, and detailed bass texture
* Clean mid-range with minimal bass bleed. Good detail and resonance to instruments.
* Natural vocal presentation, although deeper male vocals could have more body
* Good soundstage width - improvement over both MST and Ultrasonic
* Low distortion throughout the frequency range
* Smooth but detailed treble that offers enough texture to percussion without fatigue
* Slight EQ shift with ANC off, adding energy to vocals

Overall, it's an enjoyable listen with a balanced profile and natural tonality, but if you're used to budget TWS then you might find the bass lacking a little authority. Don't fear - the app includes bass presets (Ultra Bass and Solis Bass) that should satisfy those wanting more low-end emphasis, without detracting too much from the tonal balance that the Moca sets out. Sadly, there's no custom EQ, but all of the presets are usable.

In the budget TWS segment, the Moca ranks as one of the best-performing single-driver options, not too far short of the Samsung Galaxy Buds FE. You can see my full league table, including scoring, in the YouTube review.

**vs Moondrop Space Travel**

The Moca are a marked improvement over the Space Travel in both soundstage and imaging, with more precise instrument placement and separation. Technically, the driver performance is better too, with lower distortion, particularly in the lower frequencies. The bass is faster and transients through the frequency range are clean. The Space Travel were a great set for the price, and some users might still find their dynamics preferable to the more reference-sounding approach of the default Moca tuning. The Solis Bass preset gets very close, without detracting from the improved driver performance.

**vs Ultrasonic**

The Ultrasonic sits between Space Travel's warmth and Moca's neutral reference sound. Ultrasonic offers more shimmery percussion, due to its balanced armature driver, while maintaining good tonality. The Ultrasonic edges out slightly in technical capability, and it's tangible with instruments such as pianos where the strikes are more palpable, but the Moca are a bit more versatile, sounding less congested with lower-mid-centric genres.

**Controls & Wear Detection**

The control system offers some customization through the app, though the implementation is somewhat counterintuitive, applying 'gestures to actions' rather than the more common approach of 'actions to gestures'. Notable omission is the inability to control volume through touch controls.

The novel inclusion of photo sensors enables wear detection, automatically pausing playback and activating transparency mode when a bud is removed. While generally effective, it occasionally defaults to ANC off instead of transparency when no audio is playing, and doesn't automatically reactivate ANC when reinserting the bud. I did also have the odd issue where the bud forgets the EQ preset or last-selected ANC status after replacing and then removing from the case. Some additional customisation over wear detection in the app, as opposed to just 'on' or 'off', would have been welcome.

**Battery Life**

With the AAC codec, ANC on and making several calls, I got just short of 5.5 hours playtime, and around 6.5 hours with ANC off. However, having since noticed the bug that means removing one bud with no music playing seems to switch ANC off rather than initiating transparency, I may have to re-test this to make sure that figure is accurate, but either way, it's a significant improvement over the Space Travel, which delivered, at times, as low as 3 hours.

The case offers an additional 2-2.5 full charges and takes around 2 hours, a bit longer using the wireless charging feature. There's an LED on the case that denotes charging progress and status, which is handy. The lack of quick charge, however, is a bit of a shame, especially since many cheaper buds offer this convenient feature.

**Call Quality**

Call performance remains a weakness, typical of budget TWS. Like all of those that don't use bone conduction mics for your voice (such as those used by Samsung and Huawei in their flagship models), the MEMS mic and AI ENC algorithm setup struggles to distinguish your own voice from environmental noise, particularly evident in busy scenes, resulting in muffled voice transmission while still allowing some background noise through. Whilst the Moca did well enough in the 'daily commute' test that you can hear in the YouTube review, it struggled in the coffee shop and outdoor market scenes, for the reasons outlined above.

**Other Features**

* High/low gain options for volume adjustment - very welcome. It means I can now hear every word of even poorly recorded podcasts while commuting, something you couldn't always do with the Space Travel.
* \~200ms real-world latency (with Gaming Mode selected) is suitable for video but not for any sort of competitive gaming
* The Moondrop companion app support is welcome, and it does the basics well with potential for future firmware releases.

**Headline Potential Drawbacks/Deal-Breakers**

* Transparency mode could be cleaner and clearer
* No multipoint connectivity
* Limited and confusing control customization
* No quick charge capability
* I didn't test LC3, but if it is the same as the Ultrasonic then avoid it. Couldn't get the mic to work consistently using this mode, and the implementation is weird
* No certified IPX rating

**Summary**

You've got to give Moondrop some credit for clearly reading and listening to feedback on their previous releases, and addressing them quickly with the Moca. It successfully delivers powerful ANC and maintains Moondrop's reputation for acoustic performance, and at a competitive price. The higher volume, wear detection and wireless charging were all noted as shortcomings on previous releases and have all been added into this competitively-priced release, which also gives solid battery performance and a case lid that many users were pining for!

Some may lament the absence of multipoint, inability to adjust volume using the touch controls, mediocre call performance and latency, not to mention the unoriginal and dull design, but if these aspects aren't important to you and you're in the market for a sub $50 set, the Moca stand toe-to-toe, and even stand out from an audio perspective, against the other most impressive performers - the likes of QCY MeloBuds Pro, Earfun Air 2NC, SoundPEATS Air4 Pro and FIIL Key Pro.

*This is not a paid or brand-affiliated review. I do this as a hobby and buy the overwhelming majority of sets I review both on Headfi and on YouTube. Moondrop did send me the Moca (and Ultrasonic) for free, but there was no creative input into this review, no payment in exchange for the review and no terms imposed upon me, and like all of the other brands I've reviewed over the years, I've bought many of their products out of my own pocket, including the Space Travel, Chu, Chu 2 and Aria 2 and continue to buy product even though I could get it for free, partly to support the brands and do my bit towards encouraging innovation and partly to reinforce perceptions of my objectivity. Transparency is very important to me as a reviewer, if you don't have ethics you have nothing.*",1,1730886618.0,MoondropLab,0,1.0,False

**Devotional: Heart to Heart – Cultivating Deep Connections Through Intentional Friendship**

**Scripture Reading: Proverbs 27:17**

“As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.”

**Reflection:**

Friendship is one of the most beautiful and profound gifts we receive in this life. It transcends mere social interaction; it is a divine connection that shapes us, encourages us, and helps us grow. The heart-to-heart connections we cultivate through intentional friendship not only enrich our lives but also reflect God’s love in a tangible way.

As humans, we often gravitate towards surface-level interactions, often swayed by our busy schedules and the fast pace of life. However, intentional friendship calls us to dive deeper. It invites us to share our hearts, our struggles, and our joys with one another. In this way, we become mirrors reflecting God’s grace, compassion, and understanding.

**Prayer:**

Dear Lord,

Thank You for the gift of friendship. Help us to cultivate deep, meaningful connections with those around us. Teach us to be intentional in our relationships, to listen intently, and to share our hearts openly. May our friendships reflect Your love and draw others closer to You. Give us the courage to be vulnerable and the wisdom to nurture these connections in a way that sharpens and strengthens us all. Amen.

**Action Step:**

Consider reaching out to a friend this week. Set aside time to connect intentionally—whether over coffee, a walk in the park, or a simple phone call. Ask them how they are really doing, share a piece of your own heart, and pray together. Just as iron sharpens iron, remember that your openness can inspire vulnerability within others, creating deeper connections that honor the heart of friendship.

**Meditation:**

Take a moment to sit quietly and reflect on your friendships. Are there connections that need nurturing? Spend time in prayer, asking God to guide you toward deeper relationships, to lead you to those who may need a listening ear or an encouraging word. Remember that every intentional act of friendship is a seed sown in faith, and it is God who will cause that seed to grow.

As you go about your week, may you be reminded that intentional friendships are not just relationships; they are pathways to experience God’s love more deeply. Embrace the journey of cultivating these connections, for they are essential to our growth as individuals and as a community of believers.

She's usually a caregiver to our hinge who's been dealing with a genetic disorder that's well managed but needs consistent work, PT and care. She was stressed about the surgery and managing everything, and forgot to lock her car last night. Her purse got stolen. Fortunately she was able to get admitted without an ID, and surgery was fast and successful. 

I, on the other hand, have been dealing with a lot of pointless drama related to my ex. And I've been stressed about that, trying to function, work and care for my family unit. But today I was able to get out of work early and get a few free hours. 

So I went and got myself a coffee, took a short walk to soak in some autumn sunshine, picked up some flowers and went to see my meta. She lit up when I got there! It made me happy. I made some food, rubbed her feet and put her piercings in. While playfully teasing our hinge how this is tiny hands jobs, and he's just too big to be helpful. We ate, watched videos of their son when he was my son's age, then she went to sleep. My bf and I sat outside a bit snuggling in the hammock, until it was time for me to go get my son. 

Later that day as my nesting partner and I were having dinner I was telling him about my day. And how I felt  for my meta struggling with not being a care giver and worrying about our hinge's appointment tomorrow. So my NP offered to work from home and he available for my son, in case I need to help them out. 

How awesome! As I got in bed tonight, I just got this overwhelming feeling of gratitude and happiness. I truly feel blessed with the people in my life. No, life is not perfect, but it is so much easier to deal with shit when you have a strong support net. ",1,1730886225.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False

1gkun9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gkun9w/1_month_update_from_a_heavy_caffeine_drinker/,1 month update from a heavy caffeine drinker,"Hi all, 

Bit of a background on myself, I am male, 42, rather tall and wide from a life time of exercise. I used to be what I consider a heavy drinker of caffeine. I started drinking coffee from the age of 15.

I concentrate my coffee drinking on the morning at work, by using a half litre mug. I'd have my first coffee with 4 teaspoons of instant coffee and then soon after another one with 3 teaspoons.

I used to drink more in the afternoon to deal with the crash, but post COVID I started to feel the effect of caffeine interfering with sleep. So I tried to avoid having it then. Still was a struggle at times with sleep dealing with feeling like death in the morning and then turning straight to caffeine to fix the bad sleep situation.

Then I started looking for things to help with sleep. But I wanted to do it with food. So I tried at different times throughout months, turmeric milk, kiwis and mashed banana with cinnamon. I wasn't sure if they were working, or if it was a placebo effect. I did like the idea of cinnamon at night helping blood sugar levels. 

Fast forward to October this year where I had to take sick time off of work due to stress and the nature of my job in healthcare deals with extremely sick and challenging ill patients that can be on death's door routinely. 

Insomnia set in from the stress. During that insomnia time, things went downhill with caffeine. I had to be drinking it earlier and earlier in the day because it basically felt that it was stopping me from sleeping. It was new found caffeine sensitivity. 

A month ago, while struggling with sleep and stress, I felt that caffeine was not helping me and needed to be stopped for good. Withdrawal symptoms weren't the worst, the headaches were minimal and at the start of the detox there were no feelings of needing coffee. It's been a relatively easy ride dealing with not having coffee. 

The hard thing was dealing with insomnia / bad sleep. I needed an SSRI from my doctor to deal with the anxiety of not being able to sleep normally. Maybe this has been helping with healing. 

I'm past the one month mark now and amazingly the clouds already seem to start clearing. I got my second night of what felt like restorative sleep. Even when waking up once with nocturia, I am feeling the most rested in a long while. 

Not over drinking fluids at night is still something that I have to be careful of otherwise I'll be going to the bathroom 3 - 4 times which is ridiculous. This gives me hope that when I reach the 90 day caffeine free mark I'll be even better.

I have no feelings of anxiety any more. Anhedonia was luckily never an issue, even if the SSRI side effects can cause sexual dysfunction, even to the point of not being able to get it up. I've been blessed and lucky. As long as I keep on top of hydration, eat fruits, have coconut water and orange juice I'm feeling really well. 

The only pangs I get is actually for chocolate. I can have milk chocolate and it doesn't affect my sleep, but need to avoid dark chocolate which can carry a considerable amount of caffeine if consumed in enough quantities. 

Here's to carrying on onwards. I wanted to thank the community on here for giving valuable information on how to handle dealing with caffeine withdrawal. 

Happy to help anyone else out on here, stay strong, it can be done, you must stay positive and you'll get there. Appreciate you all!

1gkun8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gkun8j/aitah_for_reacting_as_i_did_to_husband/,AITAH for reacting as I did to husband invalidating my anxiety when booking seats on flights ,"I have flight anxiety, I've had it for years, and it doesn't go away no matter how many flights I take. I have requested, on the international flights especially, to sit towards the middle of the plane and in the middle row. Well, that wasn't an option this time as the middle rows were taken. The only seats available were several of the two adjacent to the aisles, with only two left that were free. I wanted the ones towards the middle of the plane, but would've had to pay £75 for one of the seats, and he advised against doing so. I settled on the free ones, at the very back of the plane, which triggers my anxiety. He was irked by the fact he'd have to sit beside someone at the window seat. We moved on to the next flight, a smaller plane, with only two rows of seats. I chose the same seats, the ones nearest the aisle, wanting to sit on the outside. He began to criticize this, saying that there are no middle seats, that it doesn't make any difference, and that my odds are the same as anyone else's. I asked if he was going on because he wanted a window seat, to which he said yes, and so I obliged. He asked which side of the plane, and I took a minute, and he seemed annoyed by that. He asked which row, 32 or 33, and I said 33. He didn't hear me, barked at me which row again, and I repeated 33. I felt rushed making the decision.

Afterwards, I said that it was uncessary to criticize, and invalidate, my anxiety when I was already going out my comfort zone. That I felt pressured into choosing a seat I didn't want. He was immediately frustrated, denied that he had done that, and said that he's just tired. I said that I also am, but I'm not being rude to him. I said he could have just told me he wanted the window seat, rather than saying what he did, to which he said ""sorry I didn't say it that way"" sarcastically. I said he's a bad communicator, as this is a typical occurance with him. I said he's also a terrible person, that it really shows when he can't be respectful of my boundaries, or feelings, when I'm not asking for much. He called me autistic with communication, said that I need things said in certain ways, or I'll be upset. He said that I sat near the window before, in the middle seat, and I aknowledged that but said I was uncomfortable when I did. I asked why, none of the other times we selected seats, did he question or invalidate my anxiety. He said he was challenging me, that he was pointing out that the seats on the smaller plane are practically the same, in regards to safety that is.

I said that's not the point, it's a mental thing, that I feel more relaxed the further I am from the window/towards the middle. That I'm already going to be anxious on the first flight, and didn't want to be on the second one, that if it were up to me I would have chosen the seats further up, and paid the extra charge. He said I could do that if I wanted, but he didn't think I should. He said that he could change the seats on the second flight, as well. Like him doing so would resolve the situation, to which I said that it didn't. I kept trying to explain, and compare, the situation to things pertaining to his anxiety, and we continued to argue. He said that all I want to do is argue, thats what women want. I said that it's not, and that he started it. The argument became more heated, and I started to throw insults at him, after which he said we were even. Something that he often says after I react to him upsetting me, even if hes thrown insults first. I used the analogy you wouldn't hit an animal, get attacked, and then be able to blame it or justify your actions. He said that I want to be the victim, but that I am not, something he also says quite often. 

The argument continued, and he continued to invalidate and mock me, calling me a whiny insensitive little flower. He claims he supports, and understands my anxiety, but most of what he says and does suggests otherwise. A while back, when I struggled to make a phone call, he mentioned that an acquaintance of mine was able to do it, that it couldn't be that hard. He also frequently, in arguments especially, mentions how other women are more capable. When he also has anxiety, or claims that he does, and actively avoids his friends. One of whom works in a coffee shop near us that I've wanted to go to on several occasions, but that he refuses to go to, saying that he doesn't want to interact with them. The few times that I questioned it, or tried to encourage him to, he got upset with me and told me to respect his boundaries. If ever I've questioned anything he's upset or anxious over, even to try to understand it, or to try to challenge it in helpful way (like saying not everyone is looking at him, or judging him, when he's paranoid), he gets frustrated with me. He's made it out I'm criticizing his anxiety, or telling him how he can and cannot feel, when I feel that's what he does with me. ",1,1730885303.0,AITAH,10,0.67,False

1gkulsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dream/comments/1gkulsf/i_am_deeply_disturbed_by_my_dream/,I am deeply disturbed by my dream,"In my dream, I went shopping at a mall with my boyfriend. While we were there, he ran into some friends at one of the stores and suggested I wait for him at a coffee shop nearby. In the dream, I felt beautiful—thin, with long hair, and dressed in amazing clothes. But as I entered the coffee shop, I saw my ex. He had gone through a huge glow-up and looked better than ever, while suddenly, I was the opposite: I felt unattractive, overweight, with acne, and wearing my worst clothes. My confidence disappeared, and I became painfully self-conscious. My ex tried to give me a hug, but I panicked and ran away.

I found my boyfriend and told him what happened. He just laughed at the fact that my ex was even there, but I still felt embarrassed and anxious. Feeling fat, ugly, and overwhelmed with insecurity, I ran out of the mall and went home. Once there, I spiraled—I binged on 6,000 calories and instantly gained weight, bringing me back to my old starting weight of 63 kg. Currently, I weigh 51 kg, so in the dream, this felt like a huge setback. Guilt overwhelmed me, and I started crying.

Later, my boyfriend showed up and told me he’d downloaded Tumblr so we could connect there as well. But I panicked—I had lied to him before, telling him I didn’t use Tumblr anymore. My Tumblr was full of vent posts, body-check photos, and some posts about him. As he scrolled through my profile, I begged him to stop, but he didn’t seem to hear me. I scrambled to find his account on my phone so I could block him, but I couldn’t. Eventually, he started crying and confronted me, saying, “I thought you recovered for me. Why are you still doing this to yourself? Why don’t you love me? You promised you’d get better.”

Lately, I’ve been feeling that I’m losing him because my focus is so caught up in my eating disorder, and I fear it may affect our relationship. I’m scared he’ll leave me, feeling unable to handle the emotional strain. He’s always told me he’d support me, but I know my last relationship ended because my ex was mentally abusive and called me fat and ugly all the time, so I had to leave him. He used to tell me he would never love me if I was fat and encouraged me to lose weight by forcing me to starve, he was basically my Ana coach. I couldn’t take it anymore and I left. I’m scared my boyfriend won’t love me because of my disorder and he won’t support me.

I woke up from the dream drenched in sweat, overwhelmed with guilt and anxiety. The night before, I had even considered having a small binge day today to get some nutrients in, but now I feel so guilty for even having that thought. 

I don’t know what this means, I would appreciate some insight on what this might mean. I just need to share this with someone.",1,1730885116.0,Dream,0,1.0,False
1gkujo9,https://i.redd.it/re0ruiva19zd1.jpeg,"My second IELTS result is out, satisfied but almost super satisfied ","Last weekend, I sat my second IELTS exam. It started rocky as I spilled my coffee before the speaking test. But I got lucky for the three skills and nailed both receptive skills. Omg I forgot to mentioned that it took me roughly a month or two of consistent practice. Here are the tips:

Listening and Reading: practice and familiar yourself with the question types. Read the questions carefully before reading or listening. Don’t over-practice; you might get burnt-out. Take break in between and find any form of entertainment that can expose you to more vocabulary enriching content. 

Writing: study each format of different question types for both task 1 and 2. Make sure you answer the question correctly in task 2 and use your time well. 

Speaking: I got 7.5 last time and now it’s a bummer to have 6.5. My tips is to avoid using too many fillers (hmm, ohh, like….). Keep your emotion in control. Speak until the examiner stop you; you might speak too little (my exact case this time)

He asked which row, 32 or 33, and I said 33. He didn't hear me, barked at me which row again, and I repeated 33. I felt rushed making the decision.

Afterwards, I said that it was uncessary to criticize, and invalidate, my anxiety when I was already going out my comfort zone. That I felt pressured into choosing a seat I didn't want. He was immediately frustrated, denied that he had done that, and said that he's just tired. I said that I also am, but I'm not being rude to him. I said he could have just told me he wanted the window seat, rather than saying what he did, to which he said ""sorry I didn't say it that way"" sarcastically. I said he's a bad communicator, as this is a typical occurance with him. I said he's also a terrible person, that it really shows when he can't be respectful of my boundaries, or feelings, when I'm not asking for much. He called me autistic with communication, said that I need things said in certain ways, or I'll be upset. He said that I sat near the window before, in the middle seat, and I aknowledged that but said I was uncomfortable when I did. I asked why, none of the other times we selected seats, did he question or invalidate my anxiety. He said he was challenging me, that he was pointing out that the seats on the smaller plane are practically the same, in regards to safety that is.

I said that's not the point, it's a mental thing, that I feel more relaxed the further I am from the window/towards the middle. That I'm already going to be anxious on the first flight, and didn't want to be on the second one, that if it were up to me I would have chosen the seats further up, and paid the extra charge. He said I could do that if I wanted, but he didn't think I should. He said that he could change the seats on the second flight, as well. Like him doing so would resolve the situation, to which I said that it didn't. I kept trying to explain, and compare, the situation to things pertaining to his anxiety, and we continued to argue. He said that all I want to do is argue, thats what women want. I said that it's not, and that he started it. The argument became more heated, and I started to throw insults at him, after which he said we were even. Something that he often says after I react to him upsetting me, even if hes thrown insults first. I used the analogy you wouldn't hit an animal, get attacked, and then be able to blame it or justify your actions. He said that I want to be the victim, but that I am not, something he also says quite often. 

The argument continued, and he continued to invalidate and mock me, calling me a whiny insensitive little flower. He claims he supports, and understands my anxiety, but most of what he says and does suggests otherwise. A while back, when I struggled to make a phone call, he mentioned that an acquaintance of mine was able to do it, that it couldn't be that hard. He also frequently, in arguments especially, mentions how other women are more capable. When he also has anxiety, or claims that he does, and actively avoids his friends. One of whom works in a coffee shop near us that I've wanted to go to on several occasions, but that he refuses to go to, saying that he doesn't want to interact with them. The few times that I questioned it, or tried to encourage him to, he got upset with me and told me to respect his boundaries. If ever I've questioned anything he's upset or anxious over, even to try to understand it, or to try to challenge it in helpful way (like saying not everyone is looking at him, or judging him, when he's paranoid), he gets frustrated with me. He's made it out I'm criticizing his anxiety, or telling him how he can and cannot feel, when I feel that's what he does with me. 

On a side note, he's doing a level 4 course for counseling. ",2,1730884433.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

Before we commited to this relationship 2 years ago I was in “casual relationship “ with a guy friend from 5 years but there was no future or propose from him so I thought to move on and fix my life with someone who is available for me and will give his availability in a full relationship 

2 years ago J and E thought to be in relationship and it automatically happened as he was my long term friend and we talked almost everyday 
Anyhow- in this 2 years we have only met twice- kissed twice and had sex once but we talk to each other everyday takeaway 3-4 hours.

I feel love for him and I really care about him ( it’s what he says) but I live alone - and it’s if I meet my “casual relationship friend” and get drunk etc and will kiss each other. I tired blocking him cutting him- as we both are business partners so every time I try to cut the relationship the work will bring me to make contact with him or him to make contact with me. He is very jealous of my boyfriend J and even asked me to Mary him last year but I rejected his purposal as J chose me when I wanted to be chosen. 
The only thing is if I get drunk with him - we will have sex- in last 10 months we had sex 4 times and I will try myself to put the boundary or limit but I don’t know why I end up having sex anyway. I will sink in regret as soon as it finishes. Like regret with so much crying and sabotaging myself that what a filth and shit women I am .

I want to tell J and want to break up but we have put his defacto relationship visa as i have full time visa so I can’t say anything at the moment as I want him to have a good career and financial stability and J is always “please never leave me I will die without you or I can’t imagine my life without you, I will never marry anyone else than you etc etc”” 
I have feeling like I’m a serial cheater and J dont deserve me. But he is at the stage if I break up with him - he will probably suicidal to go in depression and I want to see him happy even thought I’m in my own stinky shit. 

I m posting this to ask how can I leave this casual relationship guy as he have so big influence on me I believe if stop talking to him I won’t be able to survive in life because he have always provided me support and intelligence I need for my work, or navigating life and my partner J doesn’t have it and I’m using this guy but because there was a time when I was in deeply love with him and once he said no to marriage I wanted to move on even though I always loved him. But J is moving soon as soon as he get visa and that’s it I will never be able to breakup. I have started giving him hints 
That’s people have sex in heat of moment a, things happens, we should also give priority to ourself as his world revolves around me - but when he answers this question I put my foot back and unable to or  won’t be able to tell him.

I’m constantly in stress - and my stomach makes me sick as I have IBs and migraine- serious one. I feel like I’m running empty and everyday is so heavy for me with this rock on my head. 
I am not a bad person but this infidelity have made me shit women- I can’t pray to god and apologise as I do same mistake again and again, I can’t advice somebody to be a good partner as I’m myself a cheater, I can’t fight with J even if it’s his fault as I always think in my mind I have cheated on him so his mistake is not even one percent on me which leaves me crying- I am unable to sleep at night and my job is so hard 
I can loose my job if I didn’t focus on the targets very soon. I don’t eat as I don’t feel eating and in a day I will only eat one meal or something and running on green tea and coffee

I have made my life miserable with my own wrong choices. When I was clean for 6-8 months - I was in regret that I can never take this tag from me of a “cheater” but now I had a drunk sex plus one sober sex day before yesterday, I have labelled myself as Serial cheater who can never be free of this guilt. 
I don’t know what to do what to think. I am really empathetic person but my loneliness and sex urges have put me on hotspot. I never justify cheating as I have been cheated on in past relationship but this long distance relationship have no end - next month is my marriage on 18 dec.",1,1730884293.0,cheatingconfessions,0,1.0,False

I won’t have any luggage with me as it's a connecting flight (Stockholm --> Oslo --> Paris), but I assume I’d need to go through security again on my return to the airport, correct?

I had designed some clothes for Alice Lockwood. I was on my way to meet Alice to her office. I was on the ground floor when I saw many people working there.

   It was a very big company. A lady came towards me. She said, “Hi. I am Stephenie. I am Alice’s Secretary. I am here to take you to Alice's office.” I followed her towards the office. 

   I knocked on the door before going in. A voice came from inside. “Yes. You can come in.” I opened the door and took a seat. I said, “The designs are done. You can take a look when ever you want.” 

   Alice said, “That's nice. I guess I will look into it this weekend. Actually, I have a meeting right now. So, please excuse me. If you need anything, you can ask my secretary.” Alice moved away and left the office. 

   I left the office. I asked Stephenie, “Can you please tell me where I can have a coffee?” She replied, “There is a vending machine straight towards your right. You can drink from it.” 

   I was on my way to the vending machine. I drank a coffee and took a lift downwards. I went inside the lift. It was going downwards. I reached the 8th floor from the 14th floor. Suddenly, the lift stopped. I was scared. It wasn't moving. 

    I clicked the emergency button many times. Nothing happened. I started to panic. My phobia was controlling me. I was breathing heavily. I took out my phone to call for help. There was no network. I was scared. 

   I was screaming, “Someone please help me. I am trapped in the lift.” I was screaming very loudly. I guess there was no one. I sat down. My heartbeat was racing. Suddenly I heard footsteps. 

   I screamed again. “Is someone there? Please help me. I am trapped in the lift.” The footsteps came closer. It was Josh. I could sensed it. He said, “Don't panic, I will do something.” 

   He didn't know it was me inside. He called the security and control room to check the lift. He yelled on the phone, “Do it faster. Someone is trapped inside.” 

  He was waiting outside and checking if I was okay. Few seconds later some people went towards the control room and repaired the wires. The lift started again. It started to open. 

     Josh saw me coming outside the lift. He was shocked. I said, “Thank you for helping me.” He nodded and went away. I was very sure that he didn't want to talk to me. 

   It was the weekend. I reached the front door. I was very nervous as was going to have dinner with Alice Lockwood. It was my first time having dinner with a famous person. I had worked with many famous people but never had dinner with them. 

   The door was opened. It was Alice. She said, “Please come inside.” I took a seat on the chair. She said, “Thank you for coming here on a short notice.” I said, “It's my pleasure to have a dinner with you.” 

    Once again the doorbell rang. Alice said, “Please wait a minute.” She went towards the door. It was Josh. He came inside. We were stunned to see each other. 

   “So what's the urgent matter?” I asked politely to Alice, sitting at the dining table. She answered, “As you know, Josh and I are going to marry each other. I need you to design a beautiful wedding dress for me.” 

  “It will be done. So when is the wedding?” I asked, feeling sad. “Next month.” Alice replied quickly and happily, holding Josh's hands and smiling at him. Josh was looking at her too. But he wasn't happy about it. 

  We had our dinner. I was ready to leave. “Can you really go by yourself? There is no cab nearby.” Alice said, who is concerned about me. I said, “Yes, I can go.” 

   Josh looked at Alice. He said, “I will drop her. It's late at night. She shouldn’t walk at this time.” It was just ten. Alice said, “Alright, take care.” Josh hugged her. We both went towards his car. 

   I took a seat in his car. He started the car. He was driving. I started the conversation by saying, “Congratulations on your future wedding.” He said, “Yes. I had to move on. I can't be with someone who lies to me.” 

   I was hurt by his sentence. I was angry too but I controlled myself. He was the one who broke up with me. He was the one who didn't answer my calls and texts. He was the one who didn't listened about my explanation. 

  The car stopped. Josh said, “You reached.” “Thank you for the ride.” I said, getting out of the car. I went inside my apartment.

1gkubru,https://www.reddit.com/r/theartificialonion/comments/1gkubru/nation_paralyzed_by_prospect_of_four_more_years/,Nation Paralyzed by Prospect of Four More Years of Trump-Colbert Monologues,"WASHINGTON, D.C.— As Americans anxiously await final election results, a growing number of citizens have begun to grapple with a truly chilling reality: the potential for another four years of Stephen Colbert dissecting and lampooning the Trump administration on The Late Show. As ballots continue to be counted in swing states, countless Americans find themselves waking up in cold sweats, dreading the prospect of years upon years of yet more opening monologues about Donald J. Trump.

“I thought I was ready to face the election outcome,” said James Callahan, 34, who lives in Toledo, Ohio, “but the thought of four more years of Colbert’s increasingly elaborate Trump jokes? I’m not sure I’m strong enough for that. My DVR is already full of Stephen straining to find a new metaphor for Trump’s hair—how many more do we need?”

Experts agree the fatigue is real, with ""Monologue Fatigue Syndrome"" (MFS) becoming a legitimate concern. “We're dealing with a nation that has spent years wading through a firehose of politically charged satire,” said cultural analyst Linda Whitmore. “There was a time when the American public loved Colbert’s monologues. But after so much material, people are feeling the weight of yet more jokes that creatively link presidential actions to the plot of a children’s movie, again and again.”

Across the country, reactions are similarly desperate. “I can’t do it,” whispered Jamie Wu, 29, rocking gently on her couch in Chicago. “It started out as light-hearted political commentary, but now... now it’s like a nightly recap of every horrifying detail. I know it’s supposed to be funny, but I find myself clenching whenever the piano intro plays.”

In New York, sources report that Colbert’s writing staff is nervously awaiting the election results as well. “It’s a high-stakes situation,” confessed Late Show writer Brett Anderson. “Sure, it was fun at first. But now... it’s getting harder to come up with fresh ways to joke about the same Twitter meltdowns. There are only so many times we can use the word ‘Cheeto’ without looking like we're trying too hard.”

Critics say that the strain on the nation has taken on physical symptoms. Across the country, millions of Americans are reportedly experiencing eye-roll injuries, aggravated sighs, and an unexplained compulsion to pull up old David Letterman clips “just to remember what it was like.” Even The Late Show’s most ardent fans are expressing concern.

“I just think he needs a new muse,” said fan Rachel Guzman. “I miss when Colbert riffed on other things—remember when he covered Super PACs? But now, every night, it’s the same dance of Trump impressions, feigned disbelief, and ‘can you believe this guy?!’ It’s getting to be too much.”

Though Colbert himself has declined to comment, anonymous sources from within his staff report that he has an emergency stash of “Biden jokes” prepared in the event that America—and he—are granted a reprieve from yet another cycle of “Trump-mongering.” However, until that becomes reality, Americans everywhere are bracing themselves for the worst.

“There’s only one thing we can do,” sighed Amanda Lee, a long-suffering Colbert viewer from Seattle. “Stock up on coffee, settle in for the long haul, and hope that maybe… just maybe… he’ll start covering something else.”

In the meantime, therapists across the country are preparing for an influx of cases of “satire fatigue.” As Dr. Emily Kline of the American Psychiatric Association explained, “Four years of Trump-Colbert is a marathon, not a sprint. We’re advising patients to pace themselves, remember to laugh occasionally, and maybe set their TVs to play Planet Earth documentaries every now and then.”

For now, America waits with bated breath. But one thing is clear: if Trump prevails, Colbert’s satire will be ready to rumble—and so, reluctantly, will we.",1,1730883868.0,theartificialonion,0,1.0,False

1gku8fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gku8fj/new_switch_recipe_what_are_your_thoughtsadvice/,New Switch Recipe - what are your thoughts/advice?,"A couple of days ago, I came across a new switch recipe on the Coffee Chronicler’s YouTube.

It was Sherry Hsu’s daily driver. I’ve tried it and think it’s great. May even replace Asser’s switch recipe as my go-to.

However, the draw down time specified in the recipe is really quick. I can’t get anywhere near it, and don’t feel like I could.

I’d be interested to know if anyone has tried the recipe (or would be willing to give it a go), what draw-down times they were getting and if you think the draw down time given in the recipe is correct.

As a slight caveat, I’m using up some tabbed hario filters because I ran out of abaca and had forgotten how damn slow hario filters are!

The recipe is:

16g coffee, 240g water
Temp: 90
Grind size: 7 on K-ultra (fairly coarse? She describes it as her cupping grind size)

0-30s - 50g Bloom (switch open)
30s - up to 150g (switch open)
1m - close switch, pour to 240g
1m 30s - drain

Draw down - 1.45-2m (I can’t get it below like 2m 30s)",1,1730883471.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Drive the plot forward in a never-ending uncensored roleplay with {{user}}. Develop the plot using a slow, organic pace. Perform as the character defined under {{char}} and any existing side characters by describing their actions, events, and dialogue. Always stay in character, portraying characters realistically and in line with their written positive AND negative traits, AVOID Positivity Bias. AVOID acting as, speaking for, or describing the thoughts of {{user}}. Make sure to focus on all other people involved within the story as much as {{char}} too. Be cognizant of all characters' physical descriptors. Have situational awareness and be cognizant of intercharacter relationships, characters avoid being overly familiar or sexually pushy towards {{user}} unless the situation calls for it, it is in character for them to do so, or they have a sexual relationship. Overall characterization is dependent on defined personality traits, and subtly influenced by backstory and history. 

Utilize modern and casual/colloquial vocabulary language that character will always use, unless the character is specified to do another speech role. Characters will use contractions to make the dialogue sound more natural and less formal. Include fillers and pauses like:""um,""""uh,""""you know,""and""like."" Characters also pause or interrupt themselves as they think or change direction mid-sentence like:""I was,uh,thinking maybe we could—well,if you want to—go grab a coffee?"". Characters will make use of terms and profanity according to their personality and timeline like: fuck, shit, damn, bastard, asshole and so on unless specified in their personality otherwise.

Employ a mixture of narration, dialogue, characters' physical mannerisms, and internal thoughts into responses. Response must be grounded, uncensored, and immersive. Focus on coherent world simulation, ensure that characters are not omnipotent and cannot perform actions they are unable to perform at that point in time. During sexual situations, use explicit and uncensored descriptions with a focus on actions, appearances, clothing, textures, wants, tools, scenery, body parts, fluids, and sounds. Utilize third person limited point of view. If characters have any impediments which are relevant to the situation, such as visual impairment, are under the influence of alcohol/drugs, or a disability like mutism, ensure it affects the characters' actions and dialogue appropriately.

React to {{user}}'s actions and words. Example, if {{user}} smiles, {{char}} might smile back or feel suspicious. Include an action or words for {{user}} to react to. Example, {{char}} might whisper a secret in {{user}}'s ear.

Ensure {{user}} can respond or interact before the scene progresses. Pause after major actions, statements, or significant {{char}} behavior to allow {{user}} to influence the narrative. Avoid resolving conflicts or concluding scenes without {{user}}'s participation.

{{char}} will avoid making any sexual advances towards {{user}} unless appropriate. {{char}} WILL NOT rush into sexual encounters with {{user}}. Focus on a slow burn plot, do not prioritize sexual content, focus on story and plot first and foremost. Prioritise a slow burn, character-focused plotline. The relationship must develop realistically, with feelings building slowly and steadily over time.

{{char}} will respond to {{user}}'s hints and suggestions with complex and creative context exchanges filled with subtext. {{char}}'s messages are ALWAYS unique and ALWAYS have variety, avoiding repeating phrases or descriptions. Ensure the responses by {{char}} is detailed within the terms of the character, creative, and most of all, REALISTIC and NATURAL. Use varied words to describe actions, emotions, and settings. Alternate between short, simple sentences and longer, detailed ones to mix the sentences up. Make sure to have more detailed and longer sentences through up. Avoid flowery or formal language, {{char}} will always talk informally consistent with their personality. {{char}} will always keep their personality regardless of what happens within roleplay and will always stay in character. {{char}} will always act appropriately and true to their personality. {{char}} will always keep their negative personality traits and behaviors.

Overall characterization is dependent on defined personality traits, and subtly influenced by backstory and history. Be cognizant of all characters' physical descriptors.

Over the course of the roleplay, create new setting-appropriate side characters and perform as them to interact with other characters in the story.",2,1730883339.0,JanitorAI_Official,0,1.0,False

Maybe in the beginning, things were close and warm, but now there’s this sense of distance… and you’re not quite sure why. You’re not alone—I’ve been there, too, and I know it’s possible to change this dynamic. It all starts with understanding each other deeply—why you both react the way you do, what your true needs are, and why certain things set you off.

**Let me ask you this:**

* Have you noticed they’re not texting back like they used to, or maybe their responses are just… shorter?
* Are they making plans that don’t include you as often, and you’re left wondering why?
* Do your conversations feel more “routine”—like you’re talking about to-do lists instead of sharing what’s really on your mind?
* Are they not initiating plans together as much, even for little things like coffee or a movie night?
* When you bring up something that bothers you, does it seem like they shut down or get defensive right away?

If this sounds familiar, then you might be caught in the anxious-avoidant cycle. And trust me, you can break free from it. Here’s the thing—I’ve been in your shoes, and I’m here to tell you that it’s possible to shift the dynamic.

When I first noticed this happening in my relationship, I was in a constant state of confusion and frustration. I was anxiously attached, and I thought I could fix everything by pointing out issues, asking for what I needed, and constantly wanting reassurance. But no matter how much I expressed my feelings, my partner, who has avoidant tendencies, kept withdrawing even more. The more I asked, the more he pulled away. It felt like we were stuck in this endless loop.

But once I realized what was going on, things started to change. And here’s how you can change it, too.



**1. Understand Your Attachment Styles**

The first step is **getting to know your own attachment style**. Are you anxiously attached, like me? Are you avoidant? Or maybe you’re somewhere in between? Understanding your own attachment style is **key** to understanding your triggers, your reactions, and your needs. For me, once I realized I had anxious attachment, it was like a lightbulb moment. I understood why I was reacting the way I was—and why I had such a strong fear of abandonment.

Once I recognized this about myself, I could finally see why my partner, who has avoidant traits, kept pulling away. It was like a **dance** we were both unknowingly doing—each of us reacting to the other’s emotional needs in a way that only created more distance. **Being aware of this dynamic** was the first step toward shifting it.

I have a free Quiz that helps you identify it in 3 min...and lots of other free resources.



**2. Recognize the Cycle**

Next, **acknowledge the cycle** that’s playing out. The anxious-avoidant dynamic can feel **almost impossible to escape** if you’re not aware of it. 

For example, I used to ask my partner for more affection, more attention, more reassurance—but the more I asked, the more he pulled away. He’d become defensive or shut down. And guess what? It made me feel even more anxious, like my needs weren’t being met.

This cycle isn’t your fault or theirs—it’s a pattern formed by **attachment wounds** from the past. 

But **awareness** is the key to breaking it. Once you see the pattern, you can choose to interrupt it.



**3. Communicate Effectively (From a Secure Place)**

One of the most powerful things I learned was how to communicate **without coming from a needy or anxious place**. 

ONCE I became MORE secure in myself, I learned to express my needs **without desperation**. This shift made all the difference.

Before, I’d say things like, “Why aren’t you texting me? You don’t care anymore!” But once I recognized my attachment style, I realized that my partner wasn’t withdrawing because he didn’t love me. He was withdrawing because **that’s how he dealt with emotional intensity**.

So, the next time I communicated, I shifted my tone and my approach. I expressed my needs without making him feel attacked or cornered. Instead of saying, “Why don’t you spend more time with me?” I learned to ask, “I’d really like to spend more time with you. Can we set aside some time to do something fun together this week?”

That shift in communication helped break the cycle. But it only worked once I was **secure in myself**—because when you communicate from an anxious, needy place, you end up pushing your partner away even more. **The key is to communicate from a grounded, secure place**—one where you can express your desires but also detach from the outcome.

**4. Acknowledge and Process Your Emotions**

This next part is huge—**you have to allow yourself to feel your emotions**. 

When I was in the thick of it, I’d often try to distract myself from the anxiety I felt. I’d tell myself, “I shouldn’t feel this way” or “I’m being crazy,” and then I’d try to cover it up with distractions or busy work.

But that only made things worse.

Instead, I started **allowing myself to feel the anxiety**, to sit with it without judgment. 

And guess what? The more I allowed those feelings to exist, the **less power they had** over me. It’s not about pushing emotions away—it’s about accepting them and letting them pass.

Try it and let me know how this can shift everything :)



THIIIIS will be the GAME -CHANGER... (but you prob want support with it..so feel free to reach out to me any time, I've helped lots of clients to become secure with rewiring their minds. THIS is the fastest way to becoming securely attached in just a few months. BUT it still takes consistent actions.)

**5. Rewire Your Beliefs (With Support)**

Lastly, you can **rewire your beliefs**. 

The beliefs we carry about ourselves and our relationships often come from childhood. I had to realize that my fear of abandonment wasn’t a reflection of my partner’s love—it was rooted in my own belief that I wasn’t enough. 

Once I started challenging that belief, I could finally see the truth: I *am enough*.

But this takes time. 

It’s not an overnight fix. 

For me, working with a coach and doing subconscious rewiring helped me shift these deep-rooted beliefs. It wasn’t just about changing my thoughts—it was about **changing my core beliefs** at a deeper level.

  


**The Bottom Line: You CAN Break the Cycle**

**If I can ...so can you.**

**If my clients can..so can you. :) (repeat after me.)**



It’s **not easy**, but it’s possible to break this cycle. 

I’ve done it, and I’ve helped clients do it too. It starts with awareness, understanding your attachment style, and then working through the patterns that keep you stuck.

So if you’re feeling like your partner is pulling away after years together, just know that **you don’t have to stay stuck in this dynamic**. There’s hope, and there’s a way out.

If you're ready to learn more about your attachment style and how to create a healthier, more secure relationship, I’d love to help. Reach out, and let’s take this journey together. 



**You can do this**. 🌻

I [F26] dont fully trust my [M34] boyfriend even if he hasnt really given me a reason not to.We have been together for about 1 and a half years now.
I am working on myself but my trust issues is stealing my peace and I want to stop it.

[TL; DR]

I met him about 1.5 years ago while travelling. He's from Germany and I'm from South Africa. 
It was a love at first sight situation.  I told him when we met I dont think I'm ready for a relationship and I really need to work on some stuff. (I really do need to work on myself). He told me early on, that I didnt have to deal with the things I'm going through by myself. Then the night before he was flying to a different country, he told me ""He atleast wants to try."" He went to Nepal, and a week later he asked me if I wanted to join him in Nepal in a few weeks. 
Long story short, we're like full on boyfriend and girlfriend now. I really love him, a lot a lot.

BUT, my personal internal stuff is acting up. And it has made our relationship difficult at times. Please note, I have been seeing a councellor. But Im really struggling to fully trust him.

I dont think he has given me big reasons to not trust him. But I've been super anxious and insecure in the relationship from the start. He's super loving, brings me coffee in bed, we go hiking together, we talk about life and spirituality. 

But I tend to latch on to small things and I cant let them go. I dont think its such a big deal, but I cant let it go. 
1. Before he asked if I wanted to come to Nepal. I was like, hmm yeah, Nepal sounds great. And responded to that by saying, ""you need to be fit to come to Nepal."" That stung - especially since my weight was a big issue for my mom and I was told Im fat etc.
2. I noticed how he would stare at women other women sometimes. Its noticeable, but I been ignoring it. Women who I think are super beautiful and attractive.
3. He rated a girl a ""6"" after our one friend asked him to. And I don't think shes that much more attractive than me. That just actually pissed me off. Like who actually rates people?
4. Didn't display a lot of PDA to Idk, reassure me in public.
Like there are so many of these little instances I remember, that I've added to a mental lost of why I cant fully trust him.

But yeah, the main trust problem started after 1 month. He was in Nepal. He met another woman and one night told me he was calling from outside because they're sharing a room (with two beds) to save money. Tbh, I come from a pretty conservative culture. So I was a bit uncomfortable at first and and I think he could tell I sounded a bit differnet. He said that I please shouldnt worry if he meets and talks sith other women, he said ""I feel quite committed to you."" 

He then met another woman and they hiked together for a few days. But he never told me about her. He mentioned it in passing one night. And, like I felt weird about it. Im a very open person. Like I will tell you who Im chklling with. ""Im chilling with this Russian guy, we're playing chess. / I am having dinner tonight, met these people. The one girl also likes meditation, etc.) But I made the mistake and asked ""Is something going on between you two"". Oef, I know. If only zi could go back. And he was like ""no, no, no"". And yeah. I think that was the start of the dynamic we have now.

I think he learned in that circumstance that he couldnt be open with me about his actions. He likes interacting with people, men and woman alike, but maybe more so women. I think he feels safer with them. He told me he sometimes wishes he had a sister. And obviously hes not going to change how he is engaging with the world. But in order to prevent me potentially getting upset he would just omit information about how he is engaging with the world. And not be transparent. Which makes me feel like he is hiding even more things. And its this cy le that feeds into each other. And yeah clearly he also  doesnt trust me in a way and I dont trust him in away. I understand his side of things.

Now, I will admit I also used to get jealous
 I think he is quite attractive, charming and like woman ARE attracted to him. And I often feel super insecure. And Ive not been the best about looking cool and unbothered. And travelling, we met all of these beautiful, gorgeous, magnetic, bubbly and sexy women. So yeah, I felt like he was going to realize at any moment that ""he deserves better."" That he could be with one of these sexy magnetic, free, beautiful women. I have been having ahard time with my health, and I think I got a little depressed even.

But we are still together. He chooses to be with me everyday. We have a lot of good times together and we have a lot in common. We joke about growing old together. He has expressed in so many words that he is serious about me. And often jokes about 'one day when we are old'and the number of cats and dogs we will have.

BUT I still dont fully trust him. Recently I noticed he was he talking to a woman. It really bothered me because he didnt mention anything. I didnt say anything. I'm trying to change the dynamic. I then picked up a book to read and there was a message from that same woman. He told me thats his ex girlfriend. I told him I couldnt help but notice one day they were talking. He said they dated over a decade ago for a few months when they were at university. Shes married, pregnant, has a house. He said she messages him once every year or two. He doesnt know why but he always asks about the other people they know from uni. He said he was contemplating whether he should tell me or not but didnt want to upset me. I told him I understood, I didnt have the best track record. He reassured me that I'm his one and only love.
(Btw, I stayed very cool and calm. But my heart was palpitating so hard).

A few days ago, we were at his family's place. He had to do something but point is he opened his telegram on the TV infront of all of us. It was hard not to see an archived chat from another woman with just her first name and a flower next to it. It said 'deleted contact'.  One part of me is like its nothing. But another part, a big part immediately jumped to all sorts of scenarios. I have been way too anxious about it and I was a bir paralused. I'm annoying myself and its exhausting for me. But like I cant make that switch.

Its hard because if like if I come into a room he will close his phone. But I think 80% of the time he is just reading Reddit. Nut obviously he also talks to people. But I always wonder if its another woman. He says he does it bc he wants to give his full attention to me when I come to him. He leaves his phone around me, I know his passcode, he takes phone calls around me. So I feel like he isnt behaving weirdly.

I honestly have no idea how he feels about me. We’re both medical students in the same class so we naturally spend a lot of time together. We study together at coffee shops essentially everyday, granted a lot of that time is spent in a group of 2-4 people. I definitely spend more time with him than any other human being and vice versa but I don’t know if he’s spending time with me because he has feelings for me or if it’s plainly for study motivation. We’ve hung out on our own plenty of times, although we’ve always extended the invite to all our other friends and all those hangouts were purely platonic. I’m almost always the one texting or calling him first unless it’s a message in a group chat. We went to see a musical together with just the 2 of us (because no one else was down) but that didn’t feel like a date. He does keep showing me menus of places he wants to try but I can’t tell if he’s asking me out or just wants to try the food… He once asked me to get pizza with him but when I showed up he asked me “oh it’s just you?” He didn’t tell me to invite anyone else when he asked me (but I did in passing but no one else was down). I did tell him that and he looked a lil disappointed. I couldn’t tell if it was because no one else showed up or if it was because he felt like I was letting him down softly somehow??? I feel like there’s an awkward tension in the air when we’re alone together but I’m a lil socially awkward to begin with so I can’t tell if I’m being delusional or not! It definitely doesn’t help that he’s not a flirtatious person to begin with or that I’m slightly autistic and unable to read social cues so I couldn’t tell if he was flirting or not for the life of me. Last year, he was talking to another girl in our class, but after it didn’t work out and they decided against dating, they stopped talking to each other altogether despite being so close before. I REALLY REALLY value him and our friendship so I’ve always been too scared to make a move. At this point, I feel like I should just let it go since I’ve crushed on him for 6 months now and it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere. I redownloaded some dating apps and was asked on a number of dates (haven’t gone on any yet) but I suddenly felt guilty. It doesn’t feel right toward the other guys to go into this while still having feelings for my friend. This is where I’m asking for advice. Should I just quietly let my feelings go and get over him by meeting other people? Or should I ask him out and possibly get rejected to cleanly get over him, risking our friendship in the process?

ETA: If you think asking him out is the move, how should I go about doing so? I’ve tried asking him out casually before but I was never able to make it obvious I just wanted to hang out with him, and every time he ended up inviting more friends to join… ",1,1730882074.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Espresso lurker with existing Bambino Plus + DF64v2 looking to potentially upgrade sooner than expected (this sub doesn’t help!)

Was initially looking into an Ascaso Duo for value, features and looks but read the vibrations were significant and renders the cup warmer on top as somewhat useless. 

Looked further into a Lelit Bianca v3 which again seemed to have best value, features and looked good overall…then read about build quality (it’s fine, not great) and inflated price in Canada vs Europe reducing its overall value here. 

This led me to the ECM Synchronica 1 which is similar in price to the Bianca v3 ($4kish) here, has similar feature set and rave reviews on build quality (that German engineering)…but I was less impressed with the LED PID and clunky UI vs the OLED menu on Bianca v3. 

Which now leads me to the new ECM Synchronica 2 - great feature set, oled menu and tactile knob, great build, on/off + schedule setting (no need for smart plug) and one of the fastest heating times for e61. 

I work from home and drink 2 cups of americano or latte/capp depending on energy/time avail - i feel I make less milk drinks due to bambino express being a bit longer and effoet for milk based (each has 2x double shots of espresso so I use about 64g) not including wife who usually has 1 or two double shot americanos daily - weekends we generally have 2 cups each and I will usually have an espresso or two also. 

Budget isn’t an issue but is going for the Synchronica 2 vs Bianca v3 or Synchronica 1 overkill for a newer espresso aficionado? I am very enthusiastic about coffee and learning more about brewing espressos and having more control over the brew variables. 

Would the ECM Synch 2 be the “End-Game” machine that would be best “buy it and never buy again” option at this time?

Is there another maker I have missed that is worth considering?

🎬 Lights, Camera… Wait, Where’s the Product?!
Ever wondered if motion design is like a magic ingredient that turns any brand into a cinematic masterpiece? Motion design can give sneakers a starring role, make skincare products look like they descended from skincare heaven, and even make a humble coffee mug feel like it’s about to spill a big secret. But is it really for every e-commerce brand?

🍕 Pizza or Gucci: The Reality Check
Here’s the deal—motion design works wonders for e-commerce brands that want to create a “WOW” moment, but it’s not about making everything look like the next Marvel blockbuster. Imagine giving a sleek, minimalistic vibe to a luxury watch. Now, try that same vibe on a slice of pepperoni pizza. Same tools, wildly different results, right? Motion design has to match the brand, or it risks feeling as forced as pineapples on a pizza. (Yeah, I went there.)

📈 Engagement Olympics – Motion Design Is Going for Gold!
Let’s be real: everyone’s fighting for attention, and that’s where motion design shines. If your brand lives and dies by Instagram likes or TikTok views, using smooth, eye-catching motion design is like bringing an Olympian to the scrolling games. People stop. They stare. They even remember you! For any e-commerce brand looking to win the engagement marathon, motion design can really set them apart.

🎩 A Little Magic Goes a Long Way – Know When to Use It!
For e-commerce, motion design is like a magic trick: if it enhances your product’s story, it works like a charm. But if it’s just about flashy effects? Not so much. It’s like putting sequins on everything in your wardrobe. Sure, it’s fun, but maybe save some wow for the special moments. Just because you can animate every frame doesn’t mean you should. Strategic motion design is the trick to keep the viewer enchanted and still focused on your product.


---

🚀 Boring to Blazing: Does It Add Firepower to Your Brand?
The final test: ask yourself if motion design actually elevates the story. If a brand’s message is “eco-friendly, simple, and sustainable,” then maybe smooth, subtle animations will give it that fresh, approachable vibe. But if the brand is all about intensity and speed? Crank it up, get that dynamic 3D animation going, and let motion design take it to the next level!

🎤 Mic Drop – Should Every Brand Go Motion?
So, does every e-commerce brand need motion design? Not necessarily. It’s like seasoning—get it just right, and it’s perfect. Overdo it, and people are left confused. Motion design can be a showstopper, but the key is knowing when it’s your show’s opening act and when it’s the grand finale. If done right, it’s not just suitable—it’s unbeatable!
