Recently, a friend of mine ‚Äî a total tech enthusiast and blockchain geek ‚Äî stumbled upon a surprisingly effective way to make money. At first, he kept it to himself, just to see if it really worked. Spoiler: it did.

He ended up sharing the details on his profile \[u/campbelldt\], not to promote anything, but simply because he thought it might help someone else out. No paid courses, no entry fees ‚Äî just a straightforward breakdown of what he's been doing.

I‚Äôll admit I was skeptical at first, but I gave it a try. Now I'm making around $200‚Äì$250 a day, and it doesn‚Äôt take much time at all. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt believe it at first either.

He‚Äôs not asking for anything in return, but I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd appreciate a small thank-you (like a coffee) if it ends up working for you too.

I figured I‚Äôd write this post to help spread the word. Maybe it‚Äôll be useful to someone, especially in times like these.

Either way, good luck to everyone ‚Äî and thanks for taking a minute to read this!",2,1752761451.0,CryptoCurrency,0,1.0,False

Okay, Reddit, I‚Äôve been experimenting, and I think I‚Äôve finally found a way to ditch the bulky wallet. For years, I've been that person patting down pockets, convinced I've lost my wallet (again). Anyone else tried those premium leather iPhone wallet cases with card slots?

Seriously, my wallet was a black hole. Receipts from 2018, expired coupons, and enough loyalty cards to qualify me for a small business loan. I tried going minimalist, but then I was just juggling a phone, a few cards precariously clipped together, and the constant fear of dropping everything. üò¨

Then I saw these leather phone wallets popping up. I was skeptical. Would it make my phone feel like a brick? Would my cards just fall out? But the promise of simplifying my life (and maybe looking a little more put-together) was too tempting.

The big selling point for me was the integrated card slots. I needed something that could hold my ID, a couple of credit cards, and my train pass without feeling like I was stretching the leather to its breaking point. Plus, the idea of not having to fumble for my wallet every time I needed to pay for something was incredibly appealing.

I was worried about the bulk, like everyone else. I didn't want my phone to feel like a brick in my pocket. But I was pleasantly surprised by how slim this case is. It adds minimal bulk, which is a huge win. Plus, the premium leather material feels really nice in my hand. It's definitely a step up from those cheap plastic cases I've used in the past.

One unexpected benefit has been the added peace of mind. Knowing that my cards are securely tucked away in my phone case has actually reduced my anxiety about losing my wallet. It's a small thing, but it makes a big difference.

I've also noticed that I feel a bit more organized. Before, my wallet was a black hole of receipts, loyalty cards, and random bits of paper. Now, I only carry the essentials, which has made my life a lot simpler.

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Is it really worth it?"" Honestly, for me, it is. It's solved a daily frustration, looks great, and has even boosted my confidence a little (I know, sounds silly, but it's true!).

I did a bit of research before settling on this one. I was looking for something that balanced style, functionality, and security. I wanted a leather phone wallet that would last and wouldn't break the bank. I even checked out ursupermart.com for some other options, but kept coming back to this one.

If you're tired of juggling your phone and wallet, I highly recommend giving a leather iPhone case with card slots a try. It might just be the solution you've been looking for. It's definitely improved my daily routine and given me one less thing to worry about. Plus, it looks pretty darn good.

I've found that having quick card access is a game-changer. No more digging through my bag or pockets ‚Äì just grab my phone and go. It's especially useful when I'm using public transport or grabbing a coffee on the go.

And the fact that it potentially enhances phone protection is a nice bonus. It's not a super rugged case, but it definitely offers more protection than those flimsy plastic ones.

I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I haven't had any issues with cards falling out or the leather wearing down. It seems like it's built to last, which is important to me.

Alright, Reddit fam, I need to share something I've been testing out for the past few weeks. I've always been on the lookout for ways to simplify my daily carry, and I think I finally found something that works. Has anyone else tried those premium leather iPhone wallet cases with card slots?

For years, I was that person juggling a phone, wallet, keys, and everything else. It was a mess, especially when trying to pay for something or just get through the day without dropping something. I tried minimalist wallets, but they never seemed to hold everything I needed.

Okay, so I'm usually the kind of person who just grabs whatever cheap phone case is on sale. Function over fashion, ya know? But my wallet situation was driving me nuts. I was constantly forgetting it, especially on quick trips to the store or when I just wanted to grab coffee. Carrying both my phone and my wallet felt bulky and annoying.

I started looking at phone cases with card slots, but everything I saw felt cheap or like it would fall apart in a week. Plus, most only held, like, one card. Useless! I need my ID, debit card, and my transit pass at the very least.

Then I stumbled upon this iPhone leather wallet case. I was hesitant because it was a bit pricier than what I usually go for, but the reviews were really good, and I was desperate. I ended up ordering it, and I'm SO glad I did.

First off, the leather is actually really nice. It feels premium, not like some fake plastic-y stuff. It looks classy, too, which is a nice change from my usual boring black rubber cases. I went with the brown leather, and it‚Äôs got a nice, rich color.

But the best part is the card slots. They hold three cards snugly, and I don't feel like they're going to fall out. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and they‚Äôre still as secure as day one. Huge win! üëç

It's seriously streamlined my life. I just grab my phone, and I‚Äôm good to go. No more patting my pockets to make sure I have my wallet. No more digging through my bag at the checkout. It's so much easier. Plus, I think it looks more professional when I'm out and about.

I was worried that having my cards right against my phone would mess something up, but so far, so good. No issues with my cards or my phone.

Another unexpected benefit is that the case actually seems to offer pretty good protection. I‚Äôve dropped my phone a couple of times (oops!), and it's been fine. The leather seems to absorb the impact pretty well.

I found this case at what I thought was a cool site, ursupermart.com, that seems to feature these sorts of trendy items and it looked pretty decent.

If you're looking to ditch your bulky wallet and streamline your everyday carry, I highly recommend checking out a leather phone wallet case. It‚Äôs been a total game changer for me. Seriously, something as simple as not having to worry about my wallet has made my day-to-day life so much less stressful. I feel like I am saving time and mental energy with this case. I no longer get frustrated or annoyed looking for my wallet.

I‚Äôve seen some folks compare different brands on YouTube, which is helpful if you want to research the ‚Äúbest iPhone wallet case‚Äù and ‚Äútop leather iPhone cases‚Äù out there.

If you're curious, you can find similar cases and this one that I got here: [https://go.ursupermart.com/km8Jdf](https://go.ursupermart.com/km8Jdf)

I really think these are the best option for a premium iPhone case for anyone who wants to carry their essentials in style. This really is a great iPhone card holder case

Anyway, just thought I‚Äôd share my experience. Hope this helps someone who's on the fence about getting one!

They consider these things folklore and legend to make fun videos about never what it really is.¬†*Never the truth*

The Appalachian Mountains are old, older than Pangea, and even older than when the sons of God knew the daughters of men. This small stretch of land, in comparison to the vastness of the earth, holds thousands of years of community bound together by the hard, unforgiving dirt and dense, brushy forests. The ancient can never be truly described because of this feeling, this reality. The buzzing you feel under your feet, the stacking of souls on top of one another over centuries, the crowds of the dead that continue to live within you, and the spaces between the sand and stars. The natives understood, certain land is sacred, different, because it holds the connection of a community centuries past to centuries in the future.¬†

I will note that I do not have the time or mental bandwidth to share with you all my stories and ones from friends and family members, so I will just keep it to the most recent, striking one.¬†

When family or friends visit, especially from big cities, I love showing them the ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù near my home, a place where there is no light pollution. Just a twenty-minute drive up the mountain reveals the Milky Way: nebulae, planets, and the crowded stars. Photographers travel from all over the East Coast for that iconic view. At the end of May, my family always comes to visit, hike, and explore the Monongahela National Forest. In 2022, it was no different. This year, the weather was perfect, though, so one night, we decided to drive out and see the galaxy.¬†

Before we left the house, coffees in our hands to keep us awake, I told my two younger cousins, Luke and Andrew, who were the only ones dumb enough to stay up into the wee hours of the morning, to make sure to stay in the car.¬†

‚ÄúThere are animals and things and all sorts of dangerous stuff up here,‚Äù I told them, ‚ÄúWe should stay in the car.‚Äù¬†¬†

They both agreed. Simple enough.¬†

I feel like I must briefly explain my ‚Äúcredentials‚Äù if you will. I live in Canaan Valley (Cuh-Nain) and have for twenty-three years. It is in the Allegheny Mountains of Appalachia, nestled just in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. It is a beautiful place, but vast and quiet.¬†

After several tries to get my old car to come to life, all three of us got in, I in the driver‚Äôs seat and my two cousins in the back. The worn leather rubbed against the backs of my arms as if I were lying on top of a cold, dead woman.¬†

‚ÄúHow does this thing make it up here?‚Äù my older cousin, Luke, asked.

I sighed, turning the crackling radio off, ‚ÄúDuct tape and magic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre screwed if we need to skirt outta here,‚Äù he chuckled.¬†

I turned completely around in my seat, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that.‚Äù

Canaan Valley rests just over three thousand feet above sea level. The most famous feature¬†*in*¬†the valley is Blackwater Falls, but what lies to the east is a seventeen-thousand-acre area called the Dolly Sods Wilderness, named after the only people able to settle it. Today it remains largely untouched and impassible because of the sheer density of the wildlife and severity of the landscape. This, I believe, is where¬†*those things*¬†come from, at least in this part of Appalachia, and where most of my stories originate.¬†

The ride a half-dozen switchbacks up the mountain was simple enough, but like most places in West Virginia, you do have to be careful not to hit any animals. A deer crossed our path that night. In the cold, dead silence, it stood, its glowing eyes locked onto mine. I rolled to a stop.¬†

‚ÄúGeez.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs a big buck,‚Äù the older added.¬†

It felt like a painting, but we were the ones hanging in the museum. Silence, darkness, and a large animal holding my gaze, but soon enough, it began to walk off the gravel road into the woods.¬†

The younger shifted forward and pointed, ‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs walking all weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just hurt,‚Äù I muttered.¬†

He took a deep, unsettled breath, ‚ÄúYeah, like its legs are broken.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it walking then?‚Äù

All eyes were fixed on the deer, and Luke‚Äôs question was left unanswered. No more was said as it dissolved into the darkness, a cold, desperate liquid drowning its prey.¬†



I must note,¬†*I do not go out at night*, especially alone, and especially to where we were on the edge of the Sods, but it had been calm recently, so I figured we would be safe sitting alongside the gravel path in the car with the windows down.¬†

I pulled onto the side of the gravel path around 2:00 that night with only the sound of crunching gravel under my tires and the occasional owl hoot piercing the desolate expanse.

‚ÄúWithout your headlights, it‚Äôs like,¬†*very*¬†dark.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I said back, ‚ÄúI can see the car‚Äôs shadow in the starlight.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs actually kinda not that dark,‚Äù Luke rolled down his window and stuck his upper torso into the dark, ‚Äúthe light from the stars is pretty bright, actually.‚Äù

I quickly turned around and tugged on his arm to pull him back in.¬†¬†



If you have never been to a dead zone or even some place with less light pollution, you know the light from the stars or moon is different. It is colder, emptier, tranquil in some sense, and exposing in others. It‚Äôs metallic and serene, like an untouched lake with something beneath it. It lies much lighter on the skin, but always heavy on the mind.¬†

‚ÄúDefinitely not like Dallas.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for sure,‚Äù the other agreed.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, no,‚Äù I added, my eyes fixed straight ahead.¬†

Our conversation then digressed into shallow discussions of movies that involve space. An eighteen- and sixteen-year-old boy could never see such a sublime place and contemplate the universe, but¬†*Interstellar*¬†certainly.¬†



With the windows rolled down the hooting of the owl was much more noticeable. I‚Äôve found that many people do not actually know what an owl sounds like. The best way to describe it is like a really good impression of someone wiping a window.

‚ÄúThose are owls, right?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I paused, ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Luke looked around, ‚Äúit‚Äôs, uh, very rhythmic,‚Äù¬†

I now paid closer attention to the screechy, empty hoot. The rustling of the grass stopped, as it started up again.¬†

‚ÄúLike it‚Äôs on a loop.‚Äù

I kept my eyes on the dark, swaying forest made by God but used by sin, ‚ÄúSometimes they sound like that,‚Äù I reassured, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs calling for something.‚Äù



As the night grew long and the galaxy rose high, all that lived and breathed began to step away. Many things come out at night, but they come to catch their prey in silence, and the prey become equally quiet to avoid their predator. What is left is wind, the soft breathing of the earth herself. The inhale and exhale within the throat of a sleeping woman.¬†

‚ÄúDid you see that!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I whipped my head around, fixed on his line of sight.¬†

Andrew pointed to the open sky, ‚ÄúA shooting star!‚Äù

I relaxed, ‚ÄúOh, yeah,‚Äù my eyes returned to their spot on the trees, ‚Äúbeautiful, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù

But this star did not fall to the earth; the bottomless pit remained sealed.¬†

¬†

Canaan is a wonderful hiking spot. We¬†have a rich valley surrounded by gorgeous mountains. They squeeze you tightly, whether in a hug or a choke, I cannot tell. Blackwater Falls is easy enough to get to, but what attracts most people is the Sods and the challenge they pose to experienced hikers. Muddy bogs or craggy trails, forests with completely dead underbrush, or the flora and fauna of Canada, it is truly a difficult and beautiful place.¬†



‚ÄúGo nowhere,‚Äù I heard a throaty, empty tone come from the back seat.

I glanced back, ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre there bears?‚Äù my older cousin repeated slowly, furrowing his brow at my alarmed expression.¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I breathed.¬†

‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù¬†

I simply hummed in reply, my eyes now scanning the forest.¬†

‚ÄúI mean, like, should we be worried about bears or something‚Äì,‚Äù he trailed off. ‚ÄúYou are like locked onto the trees, Caroline, and that deer looked hurt. Is everything okay?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered remaining forward, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt like going out at night.‚Äù¬†

I felt his unease in the backseat while Andrew remained relatively aloof. The glow of the starlight exposed his face to all who look in from the forest around us. His leg bounced, slightly shaking my car.¬†

¬†

I have heard people describe the Appalachian Mountains with this idea called ‚Äúthin places‚Äù but ‚Äúthin‚Äù does not seem to be the right term. Yes, ‚Äúthin‚Äù in the sense of time, almost as if you can reach through it to what was and what will be, but certainly not thin in the weight of these places. When time is thin, does not all the gravity of every present moment, millions of presents, rest in the dust and air, fill your skin and heart, soak your bones with the connection to the land and to your bloodline? Does it not press upon your chest and throat, reminding you of what lies between?

¬†

‚ÄúWe can head back,‚Äù Luke nudged Andrew, ‚ÄúYou good with heading back?‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúI mean, we have seen all that we need‚Ä¶ right?‚Äù

I glanced at the glowing clock: 3:02

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he replied.¬†

I turned to face them, ‚ÄúIf you all are okay with not seeing the Milky Way at peak, then, yeah, we can‚Äì‚Äù

A broken howl cracked the nightly silence into sharp pieces.¬†

We all froze.¬†

¬†

Have you ever heard a rooster learning to crow? As they go through puberty, they crow nonstop trying to learn and master the noise. It will always start out strong and clear, but turn sour and fall toward the end. Sometimes their ‚Äúvoices‚Äù will even crack, like a teenage boy‚Äôs will. That is what this sounded like, something learning to howl.¬†

‚ÄúWolf?‚Äù Andrew asked.¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I put the keys in the ignition, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time to go,‚Äù

Turning the keys repeatedly, the car would not sputter to life. Click, the headlights flash, the engine sputters out. Click, lights, sputter. Between each attempt was only silence, the wind had stopped, I was the only living thing moving, moving frantically at that.¬†

‚ÄúDo you see that?‚Äù Luke asked.

I kept my eyes downward, my sweaty hands fumbling with the keys.¬†

Click, lights, sputter, but no silence, the distant thump of feet or hooves, I couldn‚Äôt tell.

‚ÄúUh, yeah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs uh, like a deer or something,‚Äù Andrew answered.

Click, lights, sputter, thump.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think deer look like that,‚Äù Luke said apprehensively, as he began to breathe quicker.¬†

A putrid smell of rot masked by blueberries and incense wafted through the rolled-down windows.¬†

He stood up and reached forward into the front seat to see why the car had not started yet, ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs it not starting?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs old,‚Äù I kept my eyes on the ignition, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, uh, like, a piece of junk,‚Äù I breathed heavily.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at it!‚Äù I snapped.

¬†

Everyone in the car stopped moving and held silent.¬†

¬†

Many people say the Nephilim are giants, those children of the sons of God and the daughters of men, but I like to think of them as simply¬†*fallen half-men*. Perhaps Goliath was one, and the people of Canaan certainly were, as Moses writes in Numbers, but if you stick to canonical Hebrew Scripture and the original text, they are just ‚Äúgreat men,‚Äù a very vague term. The assumption they are giants is because ‚Äúgreat‚Äù is certainly not referring to the content of their character, as many say they are from the line of Cain, and are certainly depraved in every context. While perhaps they could be great in stature, what most distinguishes them is their complete and utter depravity, their distortion of anything that is sacred, and their darkness that strangles the air around them. Why else would God have commanded the Israelites to utterly destroy them?

¬†

Then the car finally sputtered to life, and I pressed my fingers hard and fast to roll the windows up. My fingers, painfully bent and red from pressure, all four windows could not have been slower in those seconds.

Without a word I put the car into reverse, making sure not to look ahead. The muffled crunch of gravel under my tires now reminded me of cracking bones. Another howl could be heard over the shifting rocks.¬†

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Luke reached forward and put his arm over me, stopping me. The car sat still. My brake lights paint the forest around us with wine, blood. It hid from the red light, while what was in it was drawn to it.¬†

‚ÄúThat sounds like‚Äì‚Äù another broken howl roared over the silence, ‚Äúlike uh, like a person.‚Äù

Andrew spoke rapidly, ‚ÄúYeah, like a person howling, like someone needing‚Äì‚Äù¬†

In my periphery I could see Luke look up, straight ahead.¬†

¬†

All went silent but the soft crunch of that bony gravel.¬†

¬†

The smell of rot no longer could be easily masked; it stung the air, it rested on our clothes, it seeped into that old, sagging leather.¬†

¬†

I felt Luke‚Äôs arm, now shaking, slowly move back.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúOur‚Äì our‚Äì Father...‚Äù he began, choking on his words.¬†

Andrew was mute, restrained, gripped into stillness and silence in the back of the car.

I slowly reached down to move Luke‚Äôs arm further back.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúWho art- who art-, in, uh, in Heaven‚Ä¶‚Äù

I pushed Luke off me entirely.¬†

Slowly taking my foot off the brake, we rolled backward into the darkness.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúHallow-Hallowed be thy- be thy-...‚Äù his feeble voice faded into a whisper. Snuffed out, suffocated by what was holding his eyes.¬†

As I turned the car the smell and crunching came to rest beside my window.¬†

¬†

I continued his words, ‚Äú...Be thy name, thy kingdom‚Äì‚Äù

¬†

Tap

Long nails on the back window.¬†

¬†

Tap

Luke gripped his younger cousin.

¬†

Tap

A thin, bony sound.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúThe kingdom of¬†*God*, Father of¬†*Jesus Christ*, Savior and Redeemer, thy,¬†*His,*¬†kingdom come,‚Äù I announced, the car now almost completely turned around.¬†

The silence that lives above the void stood in the car with us. It threatened to drop us.

¬†

Knock¬†

From beside me.

Silence gripped my throat.¬†

¬†

Knock

From behind.

¬†

Knock

From in front.

The car shook either from¬†*it*¬†or from the boys shaking in the back, I did not look up to see.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúAnd¬†*Thy*¬†will be done!‚Äù I squeezed tightly onto the steering wheel, the stitched thread burying itself into my skin. I put the car into drive. Dim parking lights only revealed three feet ahead of me. I kept my eyes low, shadows crawled amongst the trees, the red glow trailed behind. The stars snuffed out, darkened and tainted, covered by dark wings and depravity.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúOn earth!‚Äù I yelled, ‚ÄúFrom the heavens to the depths of Sheol!‚Äù

¬†I glanced in my rearview.¬†

At the edge of the red light something leaned in.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúAs it is in heaven!‚Äù

¬†

It was ancient, tall, but still proportionate in some ways. Twisted antlers that rustled like grass, patchy, stained fur, a sort of fleshy rot, fungal in nature, a long and bare neck, light wisps of wings, and the face of a man, quite distinctly so.¬†

¬†

Our descent had finally begun, ‚ÄúGive us this day our daily bread,‚Äù I spoke with more ease.¬†

¬†

Beautiful and terrifying. It was something so familiar, yet so foreign,¬†something assembled, not formed‚Äîlike something pretending to be made in God‚Äôs image. The boys were clutched unto each other, breathing heavily.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúAnd forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.‚Äù¬†

Even in the dark you could see clouds of dust, red by my lights and kicked up in my wake. An illuminated, bleeding gash through¬†*its*¬†air.

¬†

‚ÄúAnd lead us not into temptation.‚Äù

¬†

I took a breath, the stars shone brighter, ‚ÄúBut deliver us from evil!‚Äù Luke said with me.¬†

‚ÄúFor¬†*Thine*¬†is the kingdom, and the¬†*power*¬†and the glory,¬†*forever and ever*,‚Äù all spoke in unison.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúAmen.‚Äù

¬†



Everyone recollected themselves on the shortened ride home, and none of us ever spoke of it to each other again.¬†

Just like the Canaan of the Bible we have Nephilim of our own, fallen half-men who exist between reality and the supernatural. Depraved, mutilated, distorted, they walk the thin places where what was and what will be exist together. Supernatural by nature, but physical in all things that matter, those TikToks making light and imitating these things never get it right. The physical and inanimate can never know, see, hear, or feel what lies below and beyond. You can never truly capture what does and does not exist.¬†¬†

Can I work on the selfishness/be less self-oriented?

Here are some examples to illustrate this that he has given:

  
1) I do things for him, like get him an iced coffee or a brownie, but I will often do this just because I am already getting myself something. (Obviously there are times when I do go out of my way to do things for him, and focus solely on him and our relationship, but I understand where he is coming from because this is my thought process\*)

  
2) When I plan for us to do things, it is usually because it is something I want to do, or because something I want to do is a motive for going to X place. E.g., taking us a certain route because I want to go to X shop, but I don't always tell him ahead of time, because I don't always feel the need to/see the relevance so I just don't bring it up. (Basically, I don't see it as a bad thing, I'm not hurting or having nefarious intentions, so it's okay?). 

\*Admittedly, I do often have the thought process of: Well, I am going here because I want X thing, so I will pick him up Y thing whilst I am here too. However, very often it is the case that I have thought to get him something, and then gotten myself something only because I was going there for him. 

Of course, I know in myself that I do things for him that aren't just for me, like researching gifts for him meticulously to get the perfect one, planning to go on a trip for us both and do things I know he will love (often I will too because we have similar interests). 

I know that some of the self-centeredness is based in our inherent wiring, the neurotransmission etc (I am just starting psychoeducation following the diagnosis), but I also know that I am not just a solely selfish person. I have been told as much by others and I can feel the love and want and need to do for others, and not just myself, so I at least hope I'm not just a hopeless cause and a selfish bitch.   
  
ADVICE PART: I want to know if anybody has tips on how to improve the self-centred mindset, especially when it comes to relationships. General tips for relationships when one of you has/is AuDHD, would be amazing too.

‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏èHypersexualization (n.) ‚Äì A fancy word for turning people into walking, talking sex toys in your mind.

It‚Äôs when you stop seeing someone as a full human being with thoughts, feelings, and a mom who probably prays for them at night and you reduce them to ‚Äúabs,‚Äù ‚Äúthighs,‚Äù and ‚Äúthat thing they could do to me in bed.‚Äù

It‚Äôs when every move they make, smiling, hugging a friend, breathing, is suddenly ‚Äúsexy‚Äù to you. It‚Äôs when you analyze the way they lick their lips like you‚Äôre watching a Pornhub trailer.

And it‚Äôs dangerous. Why? Because it erases their humanity. It teaches you to treat people like objects for your consumption, instead of real, breathing humans who probably just wanted a coffee and a nap that day.

So let's get back to this never-ending circus of hypersexualization, shall we? Because honestly, every time I scroll and see y'all foaming at the mouth over William for example, I feel like l've entered the Twilight Zone.

Let's be clear: this boy, yes, boy, because compared to half of you out here, he's literally a child, is being sexualized by women old enough to be his mothers. Some of you are sitting pretty in your 30s, 40s, even 50s, writing the nastiest things about how he walks,
speculating about the size of his d*ck, and sharing it in public like it's cute.
It's creepy.

Now, imagine if the roles were reversed.
Imagine it's a young actress and men twice, even three times her age are online dissecting the shape of her breasts, the size of her butt, or how she moves her hips as if her existence is an open invitation for sexual commentary.

Y'all would be screaming ""misogyny,"" ""sexual harassment,"" and you'd be right. So why is it okay when it's two young male actors? Why does it suddenly become ""harmless fun"" or
""just fan culture"" when the targets are men?
‚Ä¢ It's gross.

And don't even try the tired excuse of ""oh but they probably like it, it's just admiration."" NO ONE likes being reduced to their body parts.
NO ONE enjoys having their existence sexualized 24/7. Compliment their work ethic, their talent, their kindness, their style, literally anything other than the shape of their f*cking crotch.

Let me tell you: there's nothing empowering, flattering, or sexy about being turned into a walking fantasy object. It's dehumanizing.
And let's address the elephant in the room, why is it that stepping into the BL fandom seems to erase all your previous values? 
You advocate for women's rights, you rally against misogyny, but the second you enter BL land, misogyny, but the second you enter BL land, you start treating these boys like they're your personal dolls for sexual projection. What happened? Did your moral compass take a sabbatical?

Grow up. Stop hypersexualizing these people.
They're human beings, not walking porn scripts.
So let's really sit down and talk about this. You know what's wild? Every time I think l've seen the peak of fan delusion, y'all climb higher like it's Mount Everest. And this time it's about William.

Reminder: William is young. A baby, compared to half of you typing filth on Twitter at 3 AM.
Some of you are old enough to have babysat him, or worse, to be his babysitter's mom. But here you are, in broad daylight, evaluating the swing of his hips like it's a damn livestock auction. Saying things like ""the way he walks, you can tell he's packing"" and ""I'd let him ruin me.""
...Excuse me?üíÄ

These boys signed up to act, not to become walking, breathing fetish material for people projecting their midlife crises onto them.
They're not here for you to live out your suppressed Wattpad fantasies. They're not your ""therapy."" They're not your serotonin suppliers.

And don't get me started on the way you infantilize AND hypersexualize them simultaneously. ""Oh he's such a baby, my precious little William,omg imagine him in bed thoü•µ‚Äù

Pick a struggle. You can't baby him and objectify him in the same breath, it's psychotic
""But we're just admiring him!""

No babe. Admiring is saying ""he's talented,""
""he's hardworking,"" ""he's kind to fans."" What you're doing is breaking down his humanity into bite-sized sexual pieces for your consumption. You're demeaning.

Seriously, can we talk about how entering the BL fandom seems to wipe all critical thinking and basic human decency out of people's heads? These are often women who in real life fight against misogyny, toxic masculinity, and harassment, then turn around and do exactly that to young male actors because ""it's different with boys.""

No, Susan. It's not different. Sexual objectification doesn't stop being gross just because it's a man on the receiving end.

""Hypersexualizing William(or any actor) isn't you being supportive. It's you turning into the very creeps you claim to despise.
Congratulations you've become the male gaze in a dress.

PSA for the BL fandom: Stop being horny on main. You're embarrassing yourselves and everyone else.
Do you know how disturbing it is when you sexualize these young men publicly? Not in your locked group chats. Not in your little fanfics. But out there, in the open, under their posts, on their lives, where their parents, siblings, colleagues, and literal CHILD fans can see it.

You don't think they read those comments?
You don't think their mothers read them? Their little sisters? Their managers? Theirs reals lovers?
I once saw a comment under Joong's post that I'll never forget. Word for word:

""I want him to appear in my room, make me kneel and suck his d*ck while calling me a slut, pulling my hair, slapping me as he fucks my mouth hard, then throw me on the bed and fuck me until I can't walk."" (I'm gonna show you the picture.)

..Ma'am...no here...
Even if you feel that way, why do you think it's appropriate to put that out there for the entire world, including him,to read?
These actors aren't your sex toys.
Imagine this: You post a cute bikini pic.
Random men in their 40s even if their youngs flood your comments saying exactly how they'd use and abuse you in bed. Would you feel ""flattered""? Or would you feel gross, violated, and maybe even unsafe?

That's what you're doing to them.

And the wildest partis that Many of these comments are coming from grown women,women who, outside BL, preach about feminism, respect, and fighting sexual harassment. Yet the second they enter the BL fandom, all those values seem to evaporate.
Suddenly, it's open season because ""they're men"" and ""it's just fun.""
No. It's not fun. It's harassment.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

""stans"" who think this is okay:
Yes, you're allowed to find someone attractive.
Yes, you're allowed to fantasize, in your private brain.
No, you're not entitled to turn your sexual fantasies into public content for them to read.
No, being in the BL fandom doesn't magically erase their right to dignity.

You want to write your little spicy fanfics? Go ahead. Share them in private spaces. But stop posting filthy thirst comments under their Instagram photos. Stop analyzing how they walk, sit, or breathe for clues about their... you know what.

Just because you're in the BL tandom doesn't mean you get a free pass to be the creepy uncle you hate at family reunions. Keep your fantasies in the drafts or better yet, in your therapist's office.

‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏èParents. Are. Watching.‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è

Picture this: Joong, William, Est or any actor...
They finish a long day of filming. They're tired but proud of their work. They open Instagram for a little serotonin. Scroll. Scroll. And then,

""Queria que ele aparecesse aqui no meu quarto, me fizesse ajoelhar e chupar o pau dele enquanto me chama de vadia...""

YEP. That. Right there. Under a wholesome photo of Joong drinking coffee.

You think he's feeling flattered? Grateful? Or is he now fantasizing about hurling his phone int a volcano and joining a monastery? it's the third option.

Now imagine his mom scrolling. Or his little brother. Or really lover. Or his grandma.
""üëµ Hey Grandma, check out what random strangers want to do to your grandson!"" Embarrassing. Utterly humiliating. For them and for you.

Desire # Permission

Look. Nobody's denying it. Joong is hot.
William is gorgeous. Est is stunning. They're walking pieces of art. But you know what's sexier? Self-control.

It's like the moment you get horny, all sense of dignity evaporates. Suddenly you're in the comment section like:

""He could destroy me and l'd thank himüò©üî•‚Äù

Girl. Breathe. Meditate. Touch some grass.
Pick up a hobby. Because posting that in public? That's not bold. That's not empowering. That's harassment.

Imagine if it were a 22-year-old actress and a
50-year-old man wrote the same thing under her post. Disgusting, right? So why does it feel
""Okay"" when it's a man?

üçëKeep your kinks in your pants (or at least your group chat)

You're horny? Fine. You fantasize about Est getting railed senseless? About William ""tying his hair back to dominate""? About Joong whispering ""good boy(girl)"" while gripping hips? FINE. Surely they can!

But why, in the name of all that's holy, must you announce it to the entire internet like it's breaking news?

Have your thoughts. Keep them to yourself.
Share them with your group chat. Write them in your little Wattpad diary. But STOP posting them under their professional photos where their colleagues, families, and managers can see them.

üíÄ""But they're men, they can take it""

Oh, because they're men, huh? So they're immune to discomfort, humiliation, or trauma?
They should just smile and take it because it's
""flattering""?
Wrong. They're human beings. They're not your toys. They don't owe you their bodies just because they act in BL.
Their job is to act. Not to serve as targets for your public sexual fantasies.

The case of Est and public fantasies

Let's get into Est. Stop imagining him ""getting taken"" in every possible position and posting your full-on porn scripts where he might actually see them.

He's just trying to post a cute selfie in a white t-shirt, and here you are:

""Omg, I bet he's such a submissive slut in bed
üò©"" (Laura: I'm really shocked about what
read every fucking day)!

Really? REALLY?

You don't know what he does in his bedroom.
You don't know what he likes. And frankly, it's NONE of your business.

Respect means:
You can imagine whatever you want privately.
You don't need to broadcast it where HE can read it.

Please babe, If your comment would make Est and Joong's mom blush, DON'T POST IT.
Horny is human. Posting it in public is disgusting.

The Delusion of Mutual Desire

Yes, you. The one writing erotic Wattpad-level monologues under Est's, Joong's, Willy, Dunk's, anyways...Instagram selfies. You, evaluating William's crotch like you're running a forensic analysis. You, posting entire porn scripts about Joong on Twitter like it's your personal diary.

Again a little secret for you: üì¢ You can want them in every position known to mankind missionary, doggy, reverse cowgirl, 69 on a balcony during a thunderstorm , but They do NOT want you.

Repeat after me:
THEY. DO. NOT. WANT. YOU.
Not in this universe. Not in any parallel timeline. Not even in the multiverse where everyone's a horny anime character.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Put Yourself in Their Shoes (If Your Brain Still Works)

Imagine this: you post a cute bikini pic on vacation, feeling yourself, enjoying life. Then a random stranger comments:

""I wish she'd kneel in front of me while I call her a slut, pull her hair, throat-fuck her till she chokes, and then throw her on the bed to wreck her until her legs don't work.""

üòêYou good? You smiling? Does it feel like a
compliment?
No? Then why do you think Joong or anyone else would feel any different seeing your comments saying the exact same thing about them?

""But they post sexy photos!""

Oh. So just because Joong posts a gym selfie or Willy wears a tank top, you think that's an invitation for you to turn the comments into your personal Pornhub script dump?
That's literally the same logic as:

That's literally the same logic as:
""Well, she wore a short skirt. She was asking for it.""
üíÄNo, babe. No. Sexy photos are NOT a consent form for public sexual harassment. If you really think that, you need therapy. And I mean intensive, not your friend's cousin who reads horoscopes.

Lock It In Your Room

Listen, I don't care if Est, Joong, Willy, Dunk or anyone else lives rent-free in your brain 24/7 and you fantasize about them calling you
""good girl"" while pulling your hair. That's your business. You can even write it in your diary with glitter pens.

But keep it:
‚Ä¢In your group chats.
‚Ä¢In your locked Notes app.
‚Ä¢In your imagination while your vibrator
works overtime.
Do NOT:
‚Ä¢Post it where he, his parents, his siblings,
or his future partner might see.
‚Ä¢Tag him.
‚Ä¢Make him the unwilling audience of your
thirst.

You're Worse Than What You Hate.

Some of you out here preach feminism in the morning and turn into serial sexual harassers by nightfall. You're the first to drag men for objectifying women - and yet you openly talk about ""wanting Joong to choke you while he fucks you raw"" like it's normal.

Stop Making Excuses

""Oh but he's an actor; he signed up for this."" No, dumbass. He signed up to act, not to be the star of your unsolicited X-rated fanfics.
""Oh but they're men; they don't care.""
Men are human beings too, shocker. And FYl - studies show men also suffer psychological damage from sexual harassment.

You can fantasize. You can write smutty fanfics. You can even ruin your bedsheets thinking about Joong. Go crazy, privately. But the moment you start making them read your pornographic fantasies about their own bodies.
That's harassment.
This isn't BL. This isn't yaoi. This is real life.
These are real people with families, friends, partners, and dignity.

üîíKeep your hands and your thoughts to yourself unless you're in your own bedroom.

Let me not even lie to you. I'm not some pure little angel floating on a cloud, immune to desire. There are people I find mind-blowingly attractive, men and women alike. Gorgeous.
Sexy. Deliciously hot. The type that makes you audibly say ""Damn"" when you see their photo.

But here's the catch: I don't broadcast my horny inner monologue to the entire internet for them (and their parents, especially their lovers) to read.
Why? Because I have this revolutionary concept called respect.
Write that down, babes. R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

When you post long, pornographic comments about how you want Joong to choke you and wreck your life... or about how William's walk
""proves"" his d*ck size, what that prove he did on bed... or how you just know Est loves it rough in bed you are not being ""funny"" or
""flirty.""
You're being gross. You're being a public menace. And yes, you're engaging in sexual harassment.
Your desires? Totally fine. Your imagination?
Go crazy. Your little solo session in your room with your vibrator on high speed? Not my business.
But turning these fantasies into public comments for the whole world (including their families, coworkers, and partners) to see?
Congratulations. You've officially entered Creepsville.

No, they signed up to ACT. To entertain. To sell a fantasy ON SCREEN. They didn't sign up to have strangers online treating them like living sex toys.

Also, let's kill the delusion once and for all:

‚Ä¢üòè‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è ""Co-Actors in BL series aren't actually fucking each other on vacations, on set, or in their dressing rooms.""‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®
They're colleagues. Professionals. Half the time they're not even close friends, let alone secret lovers.
And just an example: remember that infamous night when William and Est shared Est room?
Est literally built a DIY fort out of golden blankets and put a whole damn barrier between them. Does that sound like two people smashing on the low? Nope. It sounds like two exhausted coworkers trying to survive a fanservice job without scandal.

You're Not Their Partner. Stop Sexting Them In Your Head.

Some of you write these comments like you're in an exclusive situationship with them:

""I wish he'd pin me down and‚Äî""
""Imagine him doing this to me omg-""

Girl. Sir. Please.
These are not your boyfriends. Not your lovers.
Not your playthings. They don't even know you exist.
Men Are Not Exempt From Objectification Trauma

Switch the roles.

""The way she walks... she must be amazing in bed.""
""Look at those boobs; I bet they're natural."" You'd be raging. You'd be calling for their heads. You'd be right.
Now ask yourself why you think it's okay when
YOU do it to William, Est, or Joong or anyone else.It's not.

Think About Their Partners Too

A lot of these guys are probably in relationships. So imagine:
You're dating someone. You scroll through Twitter and see strangers writing filth about them. Not just ""he's hot"" but full-on sexual scripts about them with their coworkers, about how they ""must be amazing in bed together.""

Do you think that feels good? Do you think their actual partners enjoy seeing you thirst publicly over their loved ones?

You want Est? Fine.
You want William? Fine.
You want Joong to choke you while calling you a slut? Sure, babe, that's between you and your vibrator.
But keep it:In your imagination. In your group chats.In your diary.

Their sex lives are not your playground. And your fantasies? They're your own private business. Let them stay that way.

‚Äî‚Äî-‚ú®""The irony is so loud I need
earplugs.¬†‚ú®‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The Mental Gymnastics of Fandoms

You know what absolutely blows my mind? The sheer, mind-bending irony of it all. You people will openly post disgusting, explicit fantasies about these actors, how you'd let Joong wreck your entire existence, or how you just know William's walk means he's packing heat. You'll sexualize them with their coworkers, with random strangers, and even with yourself.

But the minute there are actual rumors about them dating someone in real life? The minute there's talk of them kissing someone off-screen? Suddenly you morph into purity police.

""Nooo, he said he's never kissed anyone.""
""Nooo, he's innocent, he's never had a relationship.""

So let me get this.
When it's your unhinged fantasy about him bending over a colleague in the dressing room that's fine.

But when it's a real-life girlfriend or boyfriend?
Suddenly, they're angelic virgins who've never even held hands?

Do you hear yourselves? This isn't just delusion. This is a full-blown mental illness.
And honestly, governments should be funding research into whatever this fandom brain rot is.

Here's a shocking concept for you: THESE PEOPLE ARE HUMANS.

I know, I know. Earth-shattering. But it's true.
They have hormones. They have sexual desires. They have had experiences. Yes. Sex.
The thing you keep writing about in your 3 a.m.
Wattpad smut, they know it too.

I'm around the same age as these guys, and trust me, none of us are out here living like cloistered monks. So why would Joong? Or Est? Or William? You think they've never been kissed? Never had a partner?

The reason idols and actors sell this ""virgin, innocent"" image is because it's good for business. It's not reality. It's marketing. So just be adult and understand that.

But knowing that doesn't give you a free pass to write porn about them with their coworkers or post your masturbation monologues online.

This part kills me every time. You people:
‚Ä¢ Write hardcore smut about them.
‚Ä¢ Imagine them fucking in every possible position with their co-actor.
Treat them like your personal sex dolls.

But when someone says, ""Hey, Est was seen holding hands with ..,"" you lose your minds.

""Nooo he's pure! He said in an interview he's never dated.""
You really believe that? Sweetheart. You really think these grown men are virgins because of a carefully curated PR answer?

Be serious for once.

The sheer HYPOCRISY. The Olympic-level mental gymnastics y'all do to keep your delusions alive.

Wedgies my friends:

So let's talk about Est at that polo camp with the boys. You saw him, right?, smiling, acting 100x more comfortable and affectionate than he ever does around William. And suddenly... oh no, nothing to see here, folks. You immediately pull out your Sherlock magnifying glasses and start hunting for ""reasons"" why this doesn't mean anything.

Like when Prince casually called Est ""sweetie.""
Y'all went into FULL DAMAGE CONTROL mode:

""It's just a meme! ""
""That's how they joke in Thailand!""
""It's a cultural thing. Don't overthink it.""
Sure, Jan.

But let's flip it: when Est had called Willy ""ter"" or ""baby""your comment sections EXPLODED:

""OMG proof they're married!!""
""They must be living together!!""
""This is their soft launch!!""

So why isn't Prince dating Est then? Why isn't that ""proof""? Is it because there's no BL contract tying them together? Is it because it doesn't fit your fanfiction? Be honest.

Let me tell you something: it's actually WAY more likely that Est is dating someone like Prince than William. Why? Because there's no business involved. No forced ships. No schedules. Just... people living their lives.
Radical concept, I know.

Hell, Est might even be dating someone else entirely. Maybe a guy. Maybe a girl. Maybe both. Maybe neither. Stop acting like William is his only option. You think just because they stood next to each other once, it means they're soulmates? Grow up.

The way y'all rushed to ""explain"" Est's chemistry with the polo boys but when William breathes near him, suddenly it's a sign from the universe. The hypocrisy is choking me.

Here's the truth: Est doesn't owe you a damn thing. Not his love life, not his friendships, not even a glance. You can't keep cherry-picking
""evidence"" for ships you like while dismissing everything else as ""just memes"" or ""bro moments."" Be consistent or better yet, be quiet.

Their Bodies, Their Rights

Here's another plot twist for you: William, Joong, Est, they're allowed to have sexual thoughts. They're allowed to date. They're allowed to have one-night stands if they want.
They're allowed to think someone is hot without needing your permission.

So when William checks out a girl like the other time on one of his concert, or Dunk flirts with someone at a party like he did the last time too, why are you acting betrayed?
THEY DON'T BELONG TO YOU.
You're not their partner. You're not even their friend.

The sheer audacity. You, yes, you, live your life however you want. You sleep with whoever you want. You post whatever you want. You say whatever you want. No one's out here monitoring your DMs or policing your Tinder dates.

But when it comes to these actors? Suddenly it's ""a problem."" Suddenly, you think their private lives are up for public debate just because you bought a keychain, a photocard, or a fan meeting ticket.Paying for some merch doesn't make them your personal pet. Buying a ticket doesn't give you remote control access to their relationships. They're not yours to command with your thirsty little comments.

Here's the bitter pill: they're human. Just like you. They're allowed to do whatever the hell they want in their personal lives. Date who they want. Sleep with who they want. Post what they want. They don't owe you celibacy just because you can't handle your own boundaries.

So stop acting like they belong to you. They don't. Never have. Never will. You're not their owner. You're not even on their radar. Let that sink in, darling.

The Truth Hurts

Est, Joong, William, Dunk and anyone else, they're humans. They've probably kissed people, had lovers, been heartbroken, and yes, had sex. You're not entitled to know the details. You're not entitled to inject yourself into their private lives.

Your delusions? Fine.
Your wattpad smut? Fine.
But keep it in your head or your private circles.
Stop vomiting it all over their mentions.

They don't owe you innocence. They don't owe you purity. They owe you nothing except the performances they were paid to deliver.
So act like grown-ups. Lock your fantasies in your Notes app where they belong.

Laura.

One (Christian, 35M) is kind of the ‚Äúclown of the friend group‚Äù. He is kind and loved by everyone, but has ADHD and is extremely disorganized. If going to an event, the friend group will lie saying that it starts an hour before it actually does, so he just might arrive on time. He is self-aware, and is ok with these coping strategies employed by the friend group, and calls them reasonable. Three years ago he wanted to borrow money from me to buy festival tickets. I was hesitant for obvious reasons, but also knew he would not join the rest of us if I didn‚Äôt help, so I set some conditions: He would pay me back the day after he got his salary, and if he didn‚Äôt it would cost him 25% interest per day, and I wanted it in writing, which he accepted. He is my good friend, so I would probably never have charged the interest - but viola, it worked, and for the first time ever, he actually paid me back on time without me pressuring him for months. Since then, others in the friend group have used the same tactic with consistent success (even though I acknowledge that it is patronizing and should not be necessary).

I have another friend (Melanie, 33F) who, outwardly is polished and high performing, but underneath bit messy, especially regarding money. She will often forget her card at home, does not have Apple Pay or the like and supposedly has ‚Äúsomething wrong with her Venmo account‚Äù (my country doesn‚Äôt use Venmo, but you get the point), forget to buy train tickets etc. Hence, I often end up buying her ticket, coffee etc. on the spot, to avoid awkwardness that otherwise occurs, and she promises to ‚Äútransfer the money tomorrow‚Äù. I have never been paid back without twisting her arm - i.e., I am often not paid back, as I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy debt collection. As these amounts are usually small, the individual instances do not bother me per se, but cumulatively it does bug me, and last week I tallied the amounts from this year (I‚Äôve kept a record) and learned that she owes me approximately 200 euros. It made me a slightly bitter, but also angry with myself, as I do realize I have let her take me for granted. Last weekend we were at a party, where she again didn‚Äôt have her card and wanted me to pay for the beer she had just ordered. I said that I would do it, but, citing the 200 euros, only if she complied with the same conditions to which Christian is subjected.

Melanie was offended by this, and cried, as she did not appreciate being compared to Christian, and felt that I embarrassed her because she could not pay for the beer she had in hand. She texted me the following day, wishing that I would have discussed this with her prior to the heat of the moment, in a bar.

So, AITA for not lending my friend money as per usual, and should I have called her for a chat before the party?",2,1752761112.0,AITAH,4,0.75,False

1m288p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m288p3/was_this_a_toxic_friendship/,Was this a toxic friendship?,"Hi redditors, I'd love to hear your opinions on a recent event that happened a couple weeks ago.  
  
I (F) had this female friend for around 5-6 years. We were pretty close, as in telling each other more intimate stuff, discussing relationships, life events, etc., but I wouldn't say we were best friends. We had a dynamic like she was the social butterfly (she was actually the one to first approach me very casually, as if we knew each other already), always up-to-date with events, outgoing, etc. and I was more like the opposite, so that's maybe what made us become friends. But with time I realised sometimes I felt a bit gaslighted by her, mostly following only her plans and hardly had a word to say. I didn't put too much thought on it, probably because of my fear of rejection so I guess I just let myself go with the flow. Until a recent weekend we spent together travelling, when I just couldn't hold my thoughts anymore, and that resulted in a fight. Now I feel like I should slowly ""detach"" from her.  
  
My first red flag was that she ""invited"" me to go with her but made it very clear she was going either way. I wanted to pass because she didn't make any clear plans, wasn't even sure where she wants to go (didn't even consider my opinions, too), and also my period was scheduled that time, lol. But of course I gave in as a people pleaser as I am. And I totally regretted it! I had a few moments when I genuinely felt bad (headaches, tiredness, etc), had some awful food served, so I was a bit moody sometimes. But the thing that really made me feel bad, was her attitude: Her every phrase started like ""I want to do this and that, this is what I plan to do, and if you don't want to join I won't be upset, just know that I will do it either way."" She seemed really pissed off by my presence, as if I shouldn't be there and because of me she can't follow her plans. She also pointed out that I never say what I want to do, but ironically whenever I proposed something she didn't take into consideration or if she did, she did it in a more passive agressive way. Other small gestures from her (these were also before the trip) was sometimes ignoring what I say (needed to repeat a few times to be heard), or walking so far away in front of me to the point of we couldn't see each other. Because I was afraid of her reaction and I didn't want to upset her, I stayed quiet - until the last day when I decided to tell her. I really tried to hold my frustration and mentioned that I felt like an optional presence for her, looked down on and like I shouldn't have come at all. She immediately went on the offensive - she said that she had to put up with all my drama, I ruined her whole vacation and I really shouldn't have come with her. She also said something hurtful to me - that the way I am make people manipulate me and I am a marionette, because I never say anything, she has to make all the decisions. She then rushed to get away from me and mentioned once more that if I don't mind, she will have her coffee without me and we can meet later for departure.  
The fact that she never wanted to actually listen and have a dialogue really disappointed me. A week after, when I messaged her about sharing the spendings, she refused to get money from me and pointed out that I am making a drama out of calculating everything, she just wants to enjoy her day without thinking about it, lol. She also pointed out that she doesn't see me as a marionette (after telling me with her own words), but I am the one considering myself a victim. There is so much more to say, but I guess that's enough. This whole thing made me suffer a lot and regretted that I opened to her so many times. But at the same time, I'm still thinking, what did I do wrong, is she actually right about me being too sensitive?",1,1752760645.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I'm getting sick, nausea, anxiety, all the typical crap compounded with removed gallbladder and very touchy stomach. I hit a great milestone yesterday when I went a complete day at work without smoking.  Feeling good this morning and all I could think about was morning coffee and a cig.  So I stopped and got a pack.

SO NOT WORTH IT!  The cig tasted bad.  The dopamine hit was no where near what my mind told me it would be, it was simply satisfying the thought my mind has programmed.  After lighting up - INSTANT REGRET!! Like my alcoholism - I romanticize that  drinking episodes were so much fun (they weren't) , and my brain tells me I can get that feeling back, but I cannot... ever.  Smoking is the same for me.  The enjoyment I had with morning cigs & coffee is gone for good.  But damn that thinking is so insidious.  Had  another with coffee, playing my phone game. in the work parking lot.   I realized another BS way smoking rewires me - After finishing the cig, I did not want to get out and go into work - I just wanted to feed the beast.  ""Just one more smoke"" but I abstained. 

I feel like; ""when I feel good, a smoke sounds good"" and ""when I feel bad, a smoke will at least be a distraction"".  This damn wiring has got to be changed. 

The 'bad cravings' are easier to get through, cuz I feel like crap already, and know smoking makes it worse.  Any thoughts on how to get through the 'happy cravings' like when I'm feeling better and a smoke sounds good?",6,1752760385.0,stopsmoking,2,0.88,False

Something wild is happening here in the DR. Starbucks is expanding *fast* and people are going crazy for it. They just opened the largest Starbucks in the country at √Ågora Mall in *Santiago* (yep, not even Santo Domingo!), and it‚Äôs absolutely packed. Long lines, selfies everywhere, everyone hyped for their frappes like it‚Äôs the hottest spot in town. If you're curious, here's a quick video short that captures the excitement: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GKYyWfIeXBg](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GKYyWfIeXBg)

But this isn't just a one-time hype. Starbucks already has several locations all over the country, including Santo Domingo airport with a 24/7 location for travelers (super smart move, by the way). They even opened their first drive-thru in Punta Cana, and now other cities are starting to follow that trend. It feels like they‚Äôre planting deep roots in the Dominican market‚Ä¶ and fast.

Here‚Äôs where I get a little conflicted. Dominican Republic has always had a strong coffee culture. Caf√© Santo Domingo is practically in our blood. It‚Äôs not just coffee, it‚Äôs family, it‚Äôs mornings, it‚Äôs comfort. So watching Starbucks roll in and win hearts this quickly makes me wonder‚Ä¶ is this a good thing? Is it cool to have more variety and jobs and a trendy global brand or is this slowly pushing out the identity we‚Äôve always had?

I‚Äôm super curious, How do y‚Äôall feel about Starbucks entering and growing in markets that already have their own proud coffee culture? Can both exist side-by-side? Or does one always end up replacing the other over time?

Would love to hear what‚Äôs happened in your country too. Did Starbucks blend in or bulldoze over? Let‚Äôs talk beans and culture.",1,1752760157.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False

3months of dreams. Gone.

- Next Monday: ""Just move in my house, let's build""
- Today: 14 days living together

- Sleeping in air mattress,
- One desk, two laptops, no personal space
- 16-17 hours work + 10 customer calls a day
- 4am debugging
- 220 hours that feel like 2 years of progress

We didn't just code together. 
We bled together. 
Argued over architecture at 3am. 
High-fived over breakthrough moments. 
Pushed each other through walls I didn't know I could break.

The twist? In 14 days, we've built more than I did last time. Shipped MVP faster. onboarded more customers

Does this sound familiar?

You've got a brilliant idea. Maybe you've even validated the concept, talked to potential users, and you're hyped to start building. You carve out an entire weekend, coffee brewing, ready to transform that concept into a minimum viable product.

But then... the reality hits.

You spend Friday evening setting up **authentication**. Saturday morning is consumed by **email configuration** (welcome emails, password resets, notifications). By Saturday afternoon, you're deep in the weeds building a basic **admin dashboard** to manage users or content. And Sunday? That's dedicated to **integrating payments**.

Before you know it, your ""weekend to build it"" is over, and you've barely touched your *actual* core feature. You've built a whole lot of plumbing that every single SaaS needs, but none of the unique value.

I've been there countless times. It's frustrating to dedicate so much precious time to these foundational elements that don't differentiate your product.

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the potential of a truly comprehensive ""prebuilt"" solution for this. Something that handles all of that ‚Äì auth, email, admin, payments ‚Äì right out of the box, letting you jump straight into building your unique idea.

**My question to the community is:**

How do you tackle this? Are you building everything from scratch every time? Using specific open-source tools? Or have you found/used prebuilt starter kits that genuinely save you that critical time and let you focus on your idea's core value?

What are your go-to strategies to avoid getting bogged down in boilerplate when you have a validated concept and limited time to build?

It was a really unpleasant experience that basically ruined my day and defeated the whole purpose of taking the medication. It seemed my body just couldn't handle the triple whammy of stimulants.

Our biggest ""learned it the hard way"" moment was realizing we had completely different definitions of ""clean."" I thought I was being considerate by doing dishes within 24 hours and keeping things generally tidy. Turns out, my partner's version of clean meant dishes done immediately after eating and everything having a designated spot that it ALWAYS goes back to.

We had our first real fight about me leaving a coffee mug on the counter overnight. I was genuinely confused why this was a big deal, and they were genuinely frustrated that I ""didn't care about our shared space.""

Normally my morning drink is OJ. But my wife bought some ""Mango Nectar"" at Costco the other week. I didn't love it on its own even diluted. It was ok added to my OJ. But I decided to try it as a tea.

I have a great Ceylon Tea (Cheericup Estate) and decided to try it as a Cold Brewed Tea as I've seen that done at a few places lately.

3g Tea Leaves
8oz Water

1m27q5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m27q5m/aitah_for_telling_my_new_husband_no_more/,AITAH for telling my new husband no more Christmas presents for his kids?,"I've been married to my 62-year-old husband since last December. We dated for 1.5 years prior to getting married. I will preface this by saying that he was divorced a full year before meeting me and there was NO CHEATING INVOLVED in the dissolution of his first marriage. The marriage died. His wife spent all her time with her girlfriends and continually went on girls trips and left him home. They never went on vacation together, etc. She lied about money and credit card debt and overall completely took him in the relationship for granted. Ultimately, they were living like roommates and he was deeply unhappy. 

The first Christmas he spent $700 buying gifts for his kids and one grandchild (I know this because I helped him pick everything out). To boot, he drove four hours to hand-deliver them all and take everybody out to dinner. I couldn't go with him because I had a severe case of COVID that year. When he came home from the trip, I was sad for him (but didn't say anything) when I realized they got him nothing in return and didn't even give him a card.

Last Christmas (we were married by this time), we spent $500 and again drove four hours to hand-deliver the gifts. We again barely got a thank you. The daughter whose house we went to didn't provide lunch or a meal or anything else and barely made us coffee. We provided lunch and brought all these gifts for the kids and the grandkids. And now there's a second grandchild. Again, the kids barely said thank you and gave him/us nothing in return, not even a card. We got about two hours of everybody's time that day. We spent about $800 to get an Airbnb and stay a couple of days, but nobody had time for us.

For a bit of backstory, he left his wife of 30 years suddenly and left them all blindsided. He is obviously not emotionally close to his kids, and they never call him, but he calls them monthly or tries to. When we do drive the four and five hours to visit, we get about an hour from each one. And we pay for everything. 

I have no children, and I feel like I want to protect him from the way his kids are treating him. I obviously don't know the backstory, but he was a good dad and provider, and they lived an upper-middle-class/entitled life. But as an outsider looking in, I think it's obvious that he was the breadwinner, and the mom did all the nurturing, and now the kids don't feel close to him.

Am I the asshole for telling him that he's trying too hard and he needs to let them make some effort? We're not going to get Christmas gifts for the kids this year; we'll send something for the grandchildren only. And we won't be driving down every couple of months anymore. We've invited them all up to stay with us, and none of them are coming. It's so discouraging, and I'm just so upset because I was excited that he had children, and I thought we could have some family time with them all. As an outsider looking in, I see the children as very self-centered and selfish. They all live big lives and have good jobs and big houses and plenty of money, etc. They travel all over the world and never come to visit.

I am not an evil stepmother. I was excited about having kids in our lives, and I'm still close to my stepkids from my first marriage. They love me, and we have a great relationship. 

My husband‚Äòs children don't even send him a card on his birthday, and he always remembers all of their birthdays. He will get a text usually by bedtime. Same with Father's Day. They barely send a text on Father's Day. It's just so upsetting. I feel like I want to protect him and tell him to stop trying so hard. 

we gave his son several thousand dollars towards his wedding and didn‚Äôt even get a thank you card.

Should I just let him do what he wants to do and stay out of it, or is it okay for me to do the things I've done by saying we're not driving down every two months and we're not giving Christmas gifts again this year?

TLDR: My husband's kids are selfish and ungrateful, and I'm tired of him trying so hard to connect with them. I've told him to stop getting them Christmas gifts and to not visit as often. Am I the asshole for setting boundaries and trying to protect him?",1,1752759341.0,AITAH,30,0.56,False
1m27pya,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m27pya/uncover_if_the_delonghi_nespresso_vertuo_plus/,Uncover if the De'Longhi Nespresso Vertuo Plus Coffee Maker Review Matches Your Coffee Needs,"The **De'Longhi ENV150BM Nespresso VertuoPlus Deluxe Coffee and Espresso Maker** served as my morning partner for weeks, and I‚Äôve got quite a lot to share about it. A coffee enthusiast by nature, I believe the perfect cup should strike a balance between quality, convenience, and style. This machine, with its matte black finish and sleek design, feels like a piece of art sitting on my counter, but there‚Äôs more to it than just appearances.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things I noticed was how this machine managed to seamlessly blend into my kitchen. The compact dimensions (15.35""D x 15.55""W x 9.45""H) make it efficient, even for smaller spaces like my apartment. The 40 oz removable water tank, which swivels for flexibility in placement, felt like a thoughtful touch. Modern and minimalistic, it complements the decor while staying functional. Its lightweight build (just 2.72 ounces) made moving it around a breeze, though it doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy. The buttons are responsive, and every aspect of the design feels intentional.

**Ease of Use**  
Using this coffee maker is incredibly straightforward. With the fully automatic operation mode, brewing is as simple as inserting a capsule, pressing a button, and waiting less than 25 seconds for the machine to heat up. It brews single and double espresso shots or 5 oz and 7.7 oz coffee sizes, all at the push of a button. The Centrifusion technology, unique to Nespresso machines, spins the capsule up to 7,000 rotations per minute, blending coffee grounds with water for rich flavor and crema. Watching this in action every morning became oddly satisfying. On weekdays, when I was rushed for time, the machine proved to be a lifesaver.  

[See De'Longhi ENV150BM price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07gbjq38k/)

**Key Benefits**  
- The automatic shut-off feature ensures I don‚Äôt have to worry if I forget to turn it off.  
- Brewing five different sizes gives me flexibility ‚Äì a small espresso shot during meetings, and a larger coffee for leisurely mornings.  
- Includes a complimentary Nespresso capsule set to explore different flavor profiles right from the start.  

**Flaws**  
Not everything is brewed to perfection.  
- Used capsule ejection holds up to 10 pods, but cleaning this out frequently felt like a small chore.  
- Those who dislike pod systems might find the capsules restrictive, or even a bit wasteful, although they are recyclable through Nespresso‚Äôs program.  
- While the machine operates quietly, the spinning noise during brewing might distract light sleepers in early mornings.  

**Critiques**  
- The machine feels optimized for Nespresso pods exclusively. Forget using third-party capsules ‚Äì they just won‚Äôt work.  
- The water tank, although adequately sized, sometimes felt fragile when detaching it for refills.

**Performance and Taste**  
This machine nailed the coffee flavor and consistency almost every time I used it. Depending on the selected Nespresso capsule, the coffee could be rich, bold, mild, or mellow. It even tackled my iced coffee cravings like a pro. Pouring the brew over ice gave me a caf√©-worthy drink at home.  

Many machines I‚Äôve used in the past offer versatility but compromise on taste. Not this one. Whether I had visitors preferring mild blends or my personal love for bold, robust espressos, the product catered flawlessly.  

**Other Options**  
While this appliance performs well, some alternatives might pique your interest. Machines like the Breville Nespresso Vertuo offer nearly identical brewing capabilities but come with a slightly higher-end feel. Keurig has versatile competitors in this segment too, catering to non-espresso drinkers. However, their coffee often lacks the richness achieved with Nespresso pods. The De'Longhi ENV150BM edges competitors out on style and simplicity.

**Value for Money**  
Considering the features, ease of use, and brew quality, this machine offers solid value for investment. Other high-end coffee makers in this range might not combine all these elements so effectively. While Nespresso capsules might be pricier compared to raw coffee beans, the convenience factor plays a major part in justifying the overall cost.

1m27ocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/mctd/comments/1m27ocs/chest_pain_solidarity/,Chest pain solidarity,"Hi all, I guess I just need a second opinion on if I‚Äôm overreacting or not, to see if anyone else experiences the same thing. 

For the last 2 weeks or so, I‚Äôve been experiencing sharp / quick pains in the middle left of my chest. I am used to various aches and pains, as I‚Äôm sure many of us are, but this one is new for me. I was diagnosed last year, and had various imaging done over last summer on my chest and abdomen - all which looked good so far. It‚Äôs been a year since I had that done, and I guess I want to know if this is a reasonable cause to request ‚Äúmind-easing‚Äù imagery on my chest again. I know it‚Äôs probably inflammation of some sort, but again I‚Äôve never experienced this before. And I know I‚Äôm not the only one who gets worried about something and then doctors don‚Äôt take you seriously. 

Does anyone else experience a similar kind of pain that could help me understand better / put my mind at ease? 
I‚Äôll likely call my doctor anyway to see, but just curious: 

The pain happens unexpectedly, often when I‚Äôm barely leaning over to do something simple. It just happened to me when I went to pick up my son‚Äôs water cup from the coffee table. The pain is intense, and lasts about 3-5 seconds - but it dissipates quickly with deep breathing and an open-ribcage posture. Frequency is around 2-3 times a day for the last few weeks. I don‚Äôt have a job, and I don‚Äôt do anything vigorous enough to continuously aggravate the area. 

Thanks so much for your time. If this is silly please let me know, I‚Äôm just traumatized by doctors who don‚Äôt take my pain seriously and wanting to reach out to others who share similar lives. Appreciate you all. ",3,1752759216.0,mctd,2,1.0,False

1m27lzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1m27lzc/we_tested_wormhole_travel_but_lost_contact_with/,We Tested Wormhole Travel ‚Äì But Lost Contact With The Crew,"The human race breathed a sigh of relief when we finally colonized Mars. Years of overpopulation and resource shortages left our first planet stressed. Mars was seen as a pressure valve. A new planet for us to build up and eventually ruin. But we all knew it wasn‚Äôt a permanent solution. With the way our population grows, it would only give us a finite amount of time before we were in the same boat as before. We needed more planets. Planets that are farther away and host a greater abundance of resources.

To achieve this, humanity created a breakthrough. Using artificial gravity, we were able to bend space and create wormholes. This, in theory, would allow us to travel large distances instantaneously, spreading humanity throughout the cosmos.

After years of development, the first ever spacecraft with wormhole travel technology was developed. Initial unmanned tests were incredibly promising, and soon the first-ever manned wormhole trip was set to begin.

The ship, named the Rosen, was set out on a five-month voyage to travel from Earth to Mars. Once there, the crew of around 40 were set to activate the wormhole generator and travel back to Earth instantaneously. Everyone knew there were risks, but the developers and engineers were confident in their invention. The day came, and I remember staring at the monitor as the news reporter droned on about the historical president of the mission.

I drank my coffee from its pouch and watched as the countdown began. The camera changed to a split-screen satellite view of space. One half of the screen showed the Rosen sitting in orbit around Mars, and the second half was a view of space around Earth. When the countdown hit zero, the ship suddenly blinked between the two screens. In an instant, soundlessly, the massive ship traveled over 100 million miles.

While I heard the news reporter and people around her celebrating the massive achievement, I squinted my eyes at the screen, noticing the small details they didn‚Äôt. The ship had gone dark. The navigation lights seemed to have turned off as it passed through the wormhole. Furthermore, the engines looked cool, not emitting the normal blue glow that they normally do.

The automated door to my pod opened, and my coworker, Desmond, stuck his head in and grimaced.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna be needed up front,‚Äù Desmond said in his thick Irish accent.

I groaned and rolled out of the pod. Peering out the windows of the ship, I could see the Rosen sitting off in the distance. The ship sat in the same orbit of Earth as us, just as dark as it appeared on the screen. As I entered the command room of the ship. I could hear a loud rhythmic beeping coming from the communication panel. I could see Peter and Markus running remote diagnostics and communicating with our command team back on Earth.

‚ÄúGood to see you‚Äôre awake,‚Äù Peter chimed.

I yawned and nodded, gesturing to the control panel as it continued to loudly beep.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we're trying to figure out,‚Äù Markus said. ‚ÄúWhen the Rosen made the jump, it came out the other side blaring a distress signal. Despite the signal, we can‚Äôt reach the crew on coms for whatever reason. We called command, and they said the ship wasn‚Äôt distressed until it reached our side. And then there‚Äôs the ship going dark... Command is wondering if the jump didn‚Äôt have any unforeseen reaction with nuclear engines. Causing the blackout‚Ä¶ or some other electrical malfunction.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat ship has made how many unmanned jumps?‚Äù Desmond interrupted, ‚ÄúIt came out fine every other time. I‚Äôm telling ya, one of those pilots had a royal cock-up and caused this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, that doesn‚Äôt really matter now,‚Äù Peter said, taking off his communication headphones and walking away from the coms panel, ‚ÄúCommand told us to go in through the emergency airlock and provide assistance to the crew on getting the Rosen repaired. The sooner the better, they said.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck me,‚Äù Desmond said, throwing up his hands, ‚ÄúSo much for an easy paycheck.‚Äù

The ride over to the Rosen was incredibly short. I remember seeing the massive monolith of the ship towering over our small repair freighter. Despite the crew on board only numbering around 40, the ship itself was designed to support hundreds of passengers as well as their cargo. Our freighter shook violently as we docked into the airlock. Peter typed away on the panel by the large hatch, encrypting his keycard with the needed requirements to access restricted areas on the Rosen. The first set of doors opened, revealing the bright white interior of the airlock. The four of us stepped inside as the hatch behind us closed and the hatch into the Rosen opened.

The opening hallway of the Rosen was dark with the exception of small emergency lights illuminating the hallways and rooms.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think we‚Äôd be getting some kind of greeting,‚Äù Desmond muttered, ‚ÄúWe are saving their asses after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Peter said, clicking on his flashlight and looking at his map monitor on his wrist, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find someone and have them explain what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

We traveled down the winding hallways of the massive ship, occasionally calling out but receiving no response. The eerie appearance of the empty ship began to settle on us. A palpable tension was building with every echoing footstep down the hall.

We rounded a corner to see a human figure standing at the end of the hallway. The figure was shrouded in the darkness that enveloped the whole ship, forbidding us from getting a good view.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Peter called out, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see another person on here. We were worried for a second.‚Äù

The figure didn‚Äôt move or speak, leaving us to sit in an awkward silence.

‚ÄúYou alright, sir?‚Äù Peter asked as he walked down the hallway.

I glanced over at Markus and Desmond, seeing the confused and worried expression that we were all sharing.

As Peter stepped closer, he was suddenly struck still as more of the man's features came into view of the light. He was completely naked and facing away from us. I felt my stomach churn at the sight of him. His entire body was covered in holes of all shapes and sizes. Some of the holes would slightly flex and wave like the muscles around them were contracting. He looked as though a corpse had been turned into a wasp nest. Inside each hole, I could see a small, white object that was surrounded by a fleshy red meat. As the light cast over his shoulder, the man slowly turned to face us, his face riddled with smaller holes.

‚ÄúHoly shit‚Ä¶‚Äù Desmond whispered as he stepped back.

The man‚Äôs eyes grew wide and wild as he began silently shambling towards us. Peter stretched out his arm and began backing away.

‚ÄúHey, man,‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sick, I‚Äôm gonna to need you to stand-‚Äù

Before he could finish, the man lunged forward headfirst, his arms flailing at his side as if he had no control over them. As he lunged, the holes in the man‚Äôs head produced deep, red tendrils. At the tips of each tendril were the white objects that I could now see were what looked like hooked porcupine quills. Peter dodged the incoming attack, and the man slammed onto the ground. Markus reared back to kick him, but Peter stopped him.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch him! Look!‚Äù Peter yelled, pointing to the holes on the man‚Äôs sides and back, now protruding those barbs.

Before an argument could be had, the man on the floor jumped to his feet and pounced on top of Desmond. We watched in horror as the tendrils shot from the man‚Äôs body and into Desmon‚Äôs flesh. Desmon screamed and attempted to push the man off of him, but it appeared the tendrils just pulled tighter and tighter. I watched as the tendrils would retract and shoot back out into Desmon‚Äôs skin, burrowing holes into his body. Peter and Markus stood back in shock and horror, not knowing what to do to get the man off of Desmon without being struck by the flailing barbs that rose from the man‚Äôs body.

Looking at the man, I noticed a detail I hadn‚Äôt seen before. Out of the man‚Äôs left leg, I noticed a long tendril that extended out of one of the holes and down the hall, rounding the corner. Without thinking, I dropped down to my hands and knees and grabbed hold of the long tendril.¬† It was warm and I could feel it pulsing in my hand, like a large vein. I tightened both hands around it and began pulling it apart. The vein flexed and stretched like a gummy worm before snapping with a sickening pop.

The man on Desmon suddenly flailed back, all of its tendrils retracting back into its body. The thing lurched to its feet; its arms still drooped at its sides. We prepared for another attack, but the man seemed to just walk aimlessly into the walls of the hallway, as though it was suddenly blind.

I was so focused on the man that I didn‚Äôt even notice Markus running up behind him. Markus raised up the large wrench he had retrieved from his tool pack and brought it down on the back of the man‚Äôs skull. The man fell to the ground, and Markus hit his head over and over. After a few hits, the man‚Äôs head was just a pile of mush, but his body was still struggling to get back up. I looked down to see Desmon bleeding profusely from his dozens of wounds. I knelt down beside him, but I knew there wasn‚Äôt anything I could do.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Peter mumbled under his breath.

I looked back to see six more people wandering down the hallway, all covered in holes.

‚ÄúWe need to get into a locked room, now,‚Äù Peter yelled, ‚ÄúGrab Desmond. Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù

Markus and I dropped to Desmond‚Äôs side, grabbing him by the shoulders and dragging him away from the approaching horde. Peter ran to the nearest room and placed his keycard on the scanner. The scanner dinged, and the door slid open.

We quickly pulled Desmon into the room, his screams of pain echoing down the hall and causing my ears to ring. Once on the inside, Peter used his keycard to shut the door, typing in a code on the scanner to activate the room's locking mechanism. I glanced around the room. Seeing that we had ended up in a large supply room. I quickly looked through the items at our disposal, searching for anything that could help Desmon‚Äôs injuries.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that, Peter?‚Äù Markus said, kneeling by Desmond.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Peter murmured under his breath. We could hear the hoard outside, slapping their bodies against the door.

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ Was that the crew?‚Äù Markus‚Äôs voice shook.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Markus!‚Äù Peter shouted as he hovered his hands over Desmond‚Äôs mutilated body. ‚ÄúSome of these holes got through the rib cage. We need something to stop the bleeding.‚Äù

Desmon had stopped screaming by now; perhaps he had gone into shock. I found a small first aid kit and began running to Desmon‚Äôs side. Looking back, I should have known it wouldn‚Äôt do much to help; his wounds were too extensive, but holding that little white box filled me with so much hope. I froze when I reached his side, his glossed-over eyes and pale skin staring at me. Desmon was already dead.

Before any of us could say a word, a new sound emanated from the door. A low buzzer sound followed by the metallic clicking of the locking mechanism. We slowly rose to our feet, a cold chill running down my spine as I recognized the sound.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Peter whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying codes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt getting it right,‚Äù Markus turned to Peter, ‚ÄúMaybe they don‚Äôt know the override code.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt sticking around to find out,‚Äù Peter announced, ‚ÄúGet the pry-bar out of your tool kit.‚Äù

Peter took the tool from Markus and went to the opposite side of the room. He pushed the contents off the shelves in order to climb up to the large air vent. While he worked, I looked around the storage room for anything I might use as a weapon, eventually finding a small tool bag that contained an average-sized pocketknife. It wouldn‚Äôt do much, but it was something.

Using the pry-bar, Peter popped of the opening to the ventilation shaft before calling us over. We filed into the ventilation shaft. It was cool, cramped, and dark in the vents. The floor and walls creaked and squealed as we shimmy through them.

Where are we going?‚Äù Markus asked.

Peter looked down at his wrist monitor and scrolled along the map of the ship.

‚ÄúThere might be an air vent near the airlock,‚Äù Peter replied, ‚ÄúWe can shimmy back and get into our ship. We‚Äôll call command and let them deal with this.‚Äù

The trek back went by quickly. Adrenaline was still pumping through us all. As we moved along the vent, I heard the distinct sound of the generator kicking on. The ship‚Äôs electrical power appeared to have been restored. We could see light shining through slats up ahead that Peter pointed out as the vent near the airlock. Once we reached the exit vent, Peter froze as he looked through the slats of the vent.

‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

I looked through the slats to see a mass of infected humans huddled around the airlock entrance. Their bodies riddled with the pulsing holes of the ones before.

‚ÄúWhy the fuck are they here?‚Äù Markus asked quietly.

‚ÄúThey must have known we‚Äôd come back,‚Äù Peter whispered, his brow furrowed as he watched them.

Without warning, Peter drew back his fist and punched the side of the ventilation shaft. The loud bang caused Markus and I to jump in fear.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù Markus whispered.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Peter said plainly, pointing at the slats.

We looked out to see that the infected hadn‚Äôt moved, hadn‚Äôt reacted at all to the sudden loud noise.

""These vents make a lot of noise as we travel through the,"" Peter explained, his eyes narrowing, ""They would have heard us a while ago.""

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt they react?‚Äù Markus asked.

‚ÄúThe one we faced down the hall,‚Äù Peter replied, his voice no longer concealed in whispers, ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt react to us until the light flashed over its shoulder. Until there was a visual stimulus. I‚Ä¶ I think they‚Äôre deaf.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen how do you explain the horde coming down the hall once we started screaming?‚Äù Markus retorted.

‚ÄúMaybe they weren‚Äôt attracted by the sound. Maybe they have a way of communicating without talking.‚Äù

Peter‚Äôs finger slowly moved down the slats, pointing to the single large tendrils that extended out of each person and traveled down the hall in the same direction.

‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre right,‚Äù Markus continued, ‚Äúhow does that help us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù Peter answered, looking at his wrist monitor, ‚Äúbut we aren‚Äôt getting to the ship now. We need to make our way to the Rosen‚Äôs command center. We‚Äôll get communication back online and have Earth send help. Maybe we‚Äôll find someone who can give us some answers.‚Äù

We began working our way towards the command entrance of the ship. I could feel the shock of the situation wearing off, and a horrible dread setting in. I didn‚Äôt want to go further into the ship, I doubt any of us did, but what choice did we have?

We passed alongside one of the cramped engine rooms. I looked through the slats of the vent to see multiple infected people huddled in the room. Their grotesque bodies moved erratically against the machinery. Some seemed to be holding tools while others had their hands slapped onto monitors, their fingers snapping awkwardly as they appeared to type.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre they doing?‚Äù Markus asked.

We sat in silence for a long moment observing them before Peter‚Äôs shaky voice piped up.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to repair the ship.‚Äù

My eyes widened as I finally noticed what Peter had. It was rudimentary and wrong, like a child mimicking a mechanic, but he was right. They were trying to do maintenance.

‚ÄúHow is that possible?‚Äù Markus asked, ‚ÄúHow do they know to do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe they maintain some kind of memory,‚Äù Peter answered, ‚ÄúThey could be acting out repetitive actions. Same with trying the codes on the door, muscle memory.

‚ÄúWhy would they want to get the ship‚Äôs engines running?‚Äù Markus questioned, ‚ÄúWhere the hell do they plan to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter stopped himself.

I looked over at Peter. I could see his hands shaking. He was of team leader and was doing everything to maintain his composure, but I could see it on his face‚Ä¶ He was terrified.

‚ÄúWe need to make contact with command as soon as possible,‚Äù Peter whispered, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

We continued down the path. I followed Peter‚Äôs orders as he told me where to go at each fork in the vents. The map system on Peter‚Äôs wrist monitor didn‚Äôt show the ventilation tracks, but it allowed us a basic sense of direction when compared to the hallways and rooms we moved alongside. After a while, I could feel fatigue setting in. Crawling through the vents on my hands and knees was taking a toll on my body.

As we moved, the vents suddenly felt flimsy underneath me. Each movement was met with the metal plates flexing and buckling under our weight. A loud banging and creaking sound was let out with each advancement. We passed by a large set of slats that gave a great view of the outside area. I felt like my heart stopped as I looked out. We were suspended over a large mess hall. The chairs and tables had all been pushed out to the side, leaving the center of the room spacious and bare. There were many infected people in this room. They stood almost motionless, only giving a slight sway to each side.

They stood around a large object that was fastened in the center of the room. The thing in that room was a mass of horrible ruin. A large, viscous blob with large root-like extremities holding it to the floor. Its surface was a mix of deep red muscles, protruding bone, and hairy skin. Like the infected crew, the mass was covered in pulsing holes. Parts of the skin would expand and contract rhythmically, as though the mass was breathing. Off each rootlike structure sprouted hundreds of long red tendrils. Most were small and slowly writhed along the ground, but others were long, stretching out of the room completely. I looked at the people standing around the room, I could see a tendril attached to each of them. It extended out of their body and connected them to the mass.

Before any of us could say a word, we heard footsteps approaching from underneath us. We looked down to see two more infected people walking into the room. I heard Peter‚Äôs breath hitch as we saw them dragging Desmond‚Äôs lifeless body into the room.

Pulling him by his arms, the two infected held up his body before the mass. He had been stripped naked, and his injuries looked much more severe, appearing as though he had been mostly hollowed out. The smaller tendrils around the mass stood up and wiggled in the air as though they were being puppeted by a sick ventriloquist. We watched in horror as the tendrils grew in size and stretched out towards Desmond‚Äôs body, slithering into the holes. I felt sick as Desmond‚Äôs skin proceeded to deform and gyrate, like a blister stuffed with worms. The tendrils began breaking off of the mass and fully entering Desmond‚Äôs body. Our coworker‚Äôs corpse suddenly lurched back, his back bent to a point of almost breaking. His arms and legs erratically waved around, almost as though it was testing the body‚Äôs limits. I watched as a thicker tendril snaked its way out of Desmond‚Äôs leg and crawled along the floor before finally reuniting with the mass in the center of the room. Desmond‚Äôs body then turned and shambled underneath us, back in the direction he came.

We sat there in the vent, slack-jawed and pale. Some say there are things humans weren‚Äôt meant to see. I didn‚Äôt believe them until that moment.

‚ÄúL-let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter said before tapping my leg and pointing me forward.

I continued down the vent until the path made a sharp left turn. As I went around the corner, I stopped as I faced a tall metal wall.

The ventilation shaft extended upward about eight feet before continuing. I placed my back against the wall and began to pant. Peter shuffled up to where I was and looked up the shaft.

‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

¬†‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù Markus asked, ‚ÄúDo you think there is another way if we funnel back?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably not,‚Äù Peter answered while looking at his wrist monitor. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a small staircase up ahead that leads to the control room. The vents have to move up a level to reach it. We've got to get up there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Markus replied, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the game plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll lift you up,‚Äù Peter said as he looked at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the smallest of the three of us, so you‚Äôll go up first. After you‚Äôre up, Markus will lift me next. After I‚Äôm up top, I‚Äôll help pull Markus.‚Äù

Markus and I shared a glance. The metal floor beneath us creaked and groaned at every move. Could it really hold all that weight? Before we could protest, Peter‚Äôs words snapped our attention.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to wait. Stand up, let's get this over with.‚Äù

I stood and looked up at the ledge. It looked so far away in that moment. Peter grabbed me around the legs and lifted me. The metal creaked loudly, and I threw my arms over the ledge. I expected to feel my weight give out from under me at any moment. That I would crash down on the violent mess below us. I held my breath and kicked up Peter‚Äôs body as I pulled myself up to safety. I turned back and looked over the edge, giving a shaky thumbs-up. Peter sighed and closed his eyes for a moment.

‚ÄúAlright, Markus, lift me up.‚Äù

Markus stood up in the shaft and looked up at the ledge where I was. He sighed before bending down and grabbing Peter by the legs. I scooted back and stared at the ledge. After a few moments, I began to see Peter rise above the ledge, his arms grabbing at the rim. I smiled at Peter for a moment before a loud metallic pop caused me to jump. Peter‚Äôs eyes widened, and I watched his form suddenly drop below the ledge with a large crash. I could hear Peter groaning as all I could see were his hands gripping the ledge.

I crawled over and grabbed his wrists, looking over the edge to see that the vent panel had collapsed under the weight of Peter and Markus. Markus lay on the ground, calling out in pain. I adjusted my grip on Peter‚Äôs arms and tried pulling him up. I then saw infected swarm over Markus, his pained screams echoing through the metal vents. I pulled up on Peter as hard as I could, but I couldn‚Äôt lift him on my own.

‚ÄúTake the keycard!‚Äù Peter yelled, his face grimacing in fear.

I hesitated for a moment.

‚ÄúDamnit! Take it!‚Äù he ordered.

I quickly released his arms and lifted the keycard off his neck.

‚ÄúThe wrist monitor too,‚Äù He groaned, sweat beading on his head.

I reached down and unbuckled the monitor from his arm.

‚ÄúGet to the command deck. Send help. Don‚Äôt look back. I‚Äôll try getting away.‚Äù

I nodded my head and turned back, scrambling quickly down the vent. I heard the metal hum as Peter released his grip, followed by a loud thud. I crawled as fast as I could, even as the sounds of Peter‚Äôs screams filled the vent.

I followed the map the best I could, winding back and forth through the ship. As I drew closer to the command center, the more my fear grew, despite its crampedness, I wasn‚Äôt in danger. What happens if I reach the command room and it‚Äôs filled with infected? I couldn‚Äôt go back. I would be out of options. As I began the final stretch to the control room, the vent began to shrink tighter. I had to lie on my stomach and shimmy along the tight corridor, the light coming from the slats being my only guidance forward.

As I reached the slats, I let out a shaky sigh of relief. There was only one infected person in the room. It faced away from me, looking out the front window of the Rosen, as though it were looking out towards Earth. I pulled out the pocketknife and shimmied it between the vent and the wall. Using it as a makeshift pry bar, I loosened the grate enough to force it off the wall with a hard shove. Even with the knowledge that the infected couldn‚Äôt hear, I still shuddered as the grate clattered against the floor behind the hole-ridden man.

I slid out of the vent and landed on my hands and knees. I stood to my feet, my back aching from the constant crawling, and walked over to the command room entrance. I looked down the hall to see it completely empty. It was just me and the one crewmate. And I had the element of surprise.

Without warning, the ship suddenly rattled and shook, and many of the monitors suddenly beeped and blinked. I was confused for a moment before the realization dawned on me‚Ä¶ It was the feeling of the engines coming to life. I looked down to see the long tendril trailing from the crewmate‚Äôs leg back towards the mass in the mess hall. The infected in the room seemed to notice the sudden shake as well. I watched as the man slowly turned away from the window to face me, his eyes lighting up when he saw me.

Seizing the moment, I reached down and grabbed the tendril, sliding my pocketknife underneath it and slicing the tendril in two. Immediately, the crewmate in the room began to convulse and thrash about in a confused manner. I ran up to the infected man, bringing my leg up and planting my foot hard into his hole-ridden chest. The man toppled back and landed on his back. ¬†He thrashed about in a feeble attempt to get up. Before he could get his bearings, I brought the heel of my foot down on the man‚Äôs shins repeatedly, continuing until I heard the bones in each leg snap.

Once I was sure the man was incapacitated, I ran to the communication monitor and began scrolling through to reach command on Earth. As I began work on establishing a connection, my eyes locked onto an anomaly on the monitor‚Ä¶ The date was wrong.

The date on the monitor read two weeks from that moment. Was it a bug? Some sort of electrical malfunction when the ship went through the wormhole? Then I saw the logs. Multiple entries, repair reports, and ration orders set over the two weeks that hadn‚Äôt happened yet. The second-to-last report was a captain‚Äôs order, detailing that the Rosen would be ‚Äúlanding on the surface to allow the engines to cool‚Äù. This made no sense to me at the time. The Rosen was designed to travel long periods through space. For the engines to overheat would require a long-running flight in an atmosphere. On top of that, what surface is the captain referring to that the ship was supposed to land on? The ship had been in outer space for the past five months

I opened the final log, a crew maintenance report. As my eyes scanned the document, a cold chill like deep space itself ran over me.

‚ÄúI have sabotaged the engines. I don‚Äôt have much time; they are testing codes on the door. It will repair the engines eventually, but it will take them time. At the very least, it might buy enough time for someone else to figure out a way to stop it. If you are reading this, it knows about Earth, it longs for it. If it reaches our planet, it will spread. You see what it has done to us. We cannot let it get to our home. I pray this final act is not in vain. I love you, Samantha. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt be there for you and Jack.‚Äù

My breath was shaky; I could feel beads of sweat forming on my face. The thing was repairing the ship so it could get to Earth.

As I stared dumbfounded at the monitor. I suddenly heard footsteps approaching from behind. A large horde of the infected crew was shambling down the hall towards the command room, their corpse-like eyes locked onto me. At the front of the horde shambled Peter and Markus. Their broken bodies a sick mockery of the men I once knew.

I ran to the hanger door and quickly swiped the keycard and input the emergency code on the door monitor, shutting the large door and sending the command room into lockdown protocol. I could hear them banging on the door as I ran to the navigation module. I didn‚Äôt have time to call for help. Once they were in this room, it wouldn‚Äôt take them long until they steered the ship straight into Earth. They might just burn up in the atmosphere, or land somewhere deep in the ocean, but I could stake the world on that chance.

I opened the navigation module, pulling up a small depiction of our solar system in real time. I found the coordinates and hastily plugged them into the wormhole navigation system. The monitor on the door began to beep. They were testing codes now.

The ship rattled, and I heard the wormhole generator hum to life. I looked out the window, a small blue rock in a near-infinite universe. It was my home. I felt fear and grief roll over me as I realized I would never see it again.

Suddenly, Earth was gone, as was space. The ship now hovered about a mile over a surface of beautiful chaos. A plane that appeared to stretch out infinitely in all directions. A land that shifted in constant, unrecognizable patterns. It is made up of colors that are both familiar and indescribable. In the mess, I could see forests, mountains, and oceans all made up of alien features. land masses folding in on themselves and becoming something entirely new.

Beyond it all was a face. The visage of this world‚Ä¶ this universe. It isn‚Äôt something easily describable. I couldn‚Äôt see it, but I could feel it so strongly that I might as well have been looking into its eyes. A being that both existed in this world and was at the same time, the world in its entirety. The being was so beautiful, but it caused my eyes to burn. They bled, and I had to look away from it. This was where they were. The folded space between our own.

I crouched down and hid myself from the gaze of the world. The banging on the door has stopped. I suppose it realized I had taken it back to its home. It knows it lost; there is no point in hunting me now.

I believe it has been about a day since I entered this folded space. That's what the date on the monitor says, at least. It feels as though it has been longer. I figured I would try sending my story through the command message system. I doubt the message will send, and even if it does, I have no way of knowing where or when it might appear. Time doesn‚Äôt seem to make any sense in this place. Hopefully, someone will read this and put an end to the Rosen travel project.

I have kept myself locked in the command room. I don‚Äôt know why. It isn‚Äôt like I‚Äôll find a way to make it out of this ship alive. I sealed my fate when I put in those coordinates. I might be better off feeding myself to that thing in the mess hall. I don‚Äôt know how long it will take for the wormhole to spit us out the other end. But part of me wants to try and stay alive long enough to see the end. To be there when the thing realizes there's no escape for it. To watch its surprise as it withers away in searing pain as the metal it's attached to melts against its putrid flesh.

1m27ky1,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1m27ky1/we_tested_wormhole_travel_but_lost_contact_with/,We Tested Wormhole Travel ‚Äì But Lost Contact With The Crew,"The human race breathed a sigh of relief when we finally colonized Mars. Years of overpopulation and resource shortages left our first planet stressed. Mars was seen as a pressure valve. A new planet for us to build up and eventually ruin. But we all knew it wasn‚Äôt a permanent solution. With the way our population grows, it would only give us a finite amount of time before we were in the same boat as before. We needed more planets. Planets that are farther away and host a greater abundance of resources.

To achieve this, humanity created a breakthrough. Using artificial gravity, we were able to bend space and create wormholes. This, in theory, would allow us to travel large distances instantaneously, spreading humanity throughout the cosmos.

After years of development, the first ever spacecraft with wormhole travel technology was developed. Initial unmanned tests were incredibly promising, and soon the first-ever manned wormhole trip was set to begin.

The ship, named the Rosen, was set out on a five-month voyage to travel from Earth to Mars. Once there, the crew of around 40 were set to activate the wormhole generator and travel back to Earth instantaneously. Everyone knew there were risks, but the developers and engineers were confident in their invention. The day came, and I remember staring at the monitor as the news reporter droned on about the historical president of the mission.

I drank my coffee from its pouch and watched as the countdown began. The camera changed to a split-screen satellite view of space. One half of the screen showed the Rosen sitting in orbit around Mars, and the second half was a view of space around Earth. When the countdown hit zero, the ship suddenly blinked between the two screens. In an instant, soundlessly, the massive ship traveled over 100 million miles.

While I heard the news reporter and people around her celebrating the massive achievement, I squinted my eyes at the screen, noticing the small details they didn‚Äôt. The ship had gone dark. The navigation lights seemed to have turned off as it passed through the wormhole. Furthermore, the engines looked cool, not emitting the normal blue glow that they normally do.

The automated door to my pod opened, and my coworker, Desmond, stuck his head in and grimaced.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna be needed up front,‚Äù Desmond said in his thick Irish accent.

I groaned and rolled out of the pod. Peering out the windows of the ship, I could see the Rosen sitting off in the distance. The ship sat in the same orbit of Earth as us, just as dark as it appeared on the screen. As I entered the command room of the ship. I could hear a loud rhythmic beeping coming from the communication panel. I could see Peter and Markus running remote diagnostics and communicating with our command team back on Earth.

‚ÄúGood to see you‚Äôre awake,‚Äù Peter chimed.

I yawned and nodded, gesturing to the control panel as it continued to loudly beep.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we're trying to figure out,‚Äù Markus said. ‚ÄúWhen the Rosen made the jump, it came out the other side blaring a distress signal. Despite the signal, we can‚Äôt reach the crew on coms for whatever reason. We called command, and they said the ship wasn‚Äôt distressed until it reached our side. And then there‚Äôs the ship going dark... Command is wondering if the jump didn‚Äôt have any unforeseen reaction with nuclear engines. Causing the blackout‚Ä¶ or some other electrical malfunction.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat ship has made how many unmanned jumps?‚Äù Desmond interrupted, ‚ÄúIt came out fine every other time. I‚Äôm telling ya, one of those pilots had a royal cock-up and caused this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, that doesn‚Äôt really matter now,‚Äù Peter said, taking off his communication headphones and walking away from the coms panel, ‚ÄúCommand told us to go in through the emergency airlock and provide assistance to the crew on getting the Rosen repaired. The sooner the better, they said.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck me,‚Äù Desmond said, throwing up his hands, ‚ÄúSo much for an easy paycheck.‚Äù

The ride over to the Rosen was incredibly short. I remember seeing the massive monolith of the ship towering over our small repair freighter. Despite the crew on board only numbering around 40, the ship itself was designed to support hundreds of passengers as well as their cargo. Our freighter shook violently as we docked into the airlock. Peter typed away on the panel by the large hatch, encrypting his keycard with the needed requirements to access restricted areas on the Rosen. The first set of doors opened, revealing the bright white interior of the airlock. The four of us stepped inside as the hatch behind us closed and the hatch into the Rosen opened.

The opening hallway of the Rosen was dark with the exception of small emergency lights illuminating the hallways and rooms.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think we‚Äôd be getting some kind of greeting,‚Äù Desmond muttered, ‚ÄúWe are saving their asses after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Peter said, clicking on his flashlight and looking at his map monitor on his wrist, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find someone and have them explain what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

We traveled down the winding hallways of the massive ship, occasionally calling out but receiving no response. The eerie appearance of the empty ship began to settle on us. A palpable tension was building with every echoing footstep down the hall.

We rounded a corner to see a human figure standing at the end of the hallway. The figure was shrouded in the darkness that enveloped the whole ship, forbidding us from getting a good view.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Peter called out, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see another person on here. We were worried for a second.‚Äù

The figure didn‚Äôt move or speak, leaving us to sit in an awkward silence.

‚ÄúYou alright, sir?‚Äù Peter asked as he walked down the hallway.

I glanced over at Markus and Desmond, seeing the confused and worried expression that we were all sharing.

As Peter stepped closer, he was suddenly struck still as more of the man's features came into view of the light. He was completely naked and facing away from us. I felt my stomach churn at the sight of him. His entire body was covered in holes of all shapes and sizes. Some of the holes would slightly flex and wave like the muscles around them were contracting. He looked as though a corpse had been turned into a wasp nest. Inside each hole, I could see a small, white object that was surrounded by a fleshy red meat. As the light cast over his shoulder, the man slowly turned to face us, his face riddled with smaller holes.

‚ÄúHoly shit‚Ä¶‚Äù Desmond whispered as he stepped back.

The man‚Äôs eyes grew wide and wild as he began silently shambling towards us. Peter stretched out his arm and began backing away.

‚ÄúHey, man,‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sick, I‚Äôm gonna to need you to stand-‚Äù

Before he could finish, the man lunged forward headfirst, his arms flailing at his side as if he had no control over them. As he lunged, the holes in the man‚Äôs head produced deep, red tendrils. At the tips of each tendril were the white objects that I could now see were what looked like hooked porcupine quills. Peter dodged the incoming attack, and the man slammed onto the ground. Markus reared back to kick him, but Peter stopped him.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch him! Look!‚Äù Peter yelled, pointing to the holes on the man‚Äôs sides and back, now protruding those barbs.

Before an argument could be had, the man on the floor jumped to his feet and pounced on top of Desmond. We watched in horror as the tendrils shot from the man‚Äôs body and into Desmon‚Äôs flesh. Desmon screamed and attempted to push the man off of him, but it appeared the tendrils just pulled tighter and tighter. I watched as the tendrils would retract and shoot back out into Desmon‚Äôs skin, burrowing holes into his body. Peter and Markus stood back in shock and horror, not knowing what to do to get the man off of Desmon without being struck by the flailing barbs that rose from the man‚Äôs body.

Looking at the man, I noticed a detail I hadn‚Äôt seen before. Out of the man‚Äôs left leg, I noticed a long tendril that extended out of one of the holes and down the hall, rounding the corner. Without thinking, I dropped down to my hands and knees and grabbed hold of the long tendril.¬† It was warm and I could feel it pulsing in my hand, like a large vein. I tightened both hands around it and began pulling it apart. The vein flexed and stretched like a gummy worm before snapping with a sickening pop.

The man on Desmon suddenly flailed back, all of its tendrils retracting back into its body. The thing lurched to its feet; its arms still drooped at its sides. We prepared for another attack, but the man seemed to just walk aimlessly into the walls of the hallway, as though it was suddenly blind.

I was so focused on the man that I didn‚Äôt even notice Markus running up behind him. Markus raised up the large wrench he had retrieved from his tool pack and brought it down on the back of the man‚Äôs skull. The man fell to the ground, and Markus hit his head over and over. After a few hits, the man‚Äôs head was just a pile of mush, but his body was still struggling to get back up. I looked down to see Desmon bleeding profusely from his dozens of wounds. I knelt down beside him, but I knew there wasn‚Äôt anything I could do.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Peter mumbled under his breath.

I looked back to see six more people wandering down the hallway, all covered in holes.

‚ÄúWe need to get into a locked room, now,‚Äù Peter yelled, ‚ÄúGrab Desmond. Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù

Markus and I dropped to Desmond‚Äôs side, grabbing him by the shoulders and dragging him away from the approaching horde. Peter ran to the nearest room and placed his keycard on the scanner. The scanner dinged, and the door slid open.

We quickly pulled Desmon into the room, his screams of pain echoing down the hall and causing my ears to ring. Once on the inside, Peter used his keycard to shut the door, typing in a code on the scanner to activate the room's locking mechanism. I glanced around the room. Seeing that we had ended up in a large supply room. I quickly looked through the items at our disposal, searching for anything that could help Desmon‚Äôs injuries.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that, Peter?‚Äù Markus said, kneeling by Desmond.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Peter murmured under his breath. We could hear the hoard outside, slapping their bodies against the door.

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ Was that the crew?‚Äù Markus‚Äôs voice shook.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Markus!‚Äù Peter shouted as he hovered his hands over Desmond‚Äôs mutilated body. ‚ÄúSome of these holes got through the rib cage. We need something to stop the bleeding.‚Äù

Desmon had stopped screaming by now; perhaps he had gone into shock. I found a small first aid kit and began running to Desmon‚Äôs side. Looking back, I should have known it wouldn‚Äôt do much to help; his wounds were too extensive, but holding that little white box filled me with so much hope. I froze when I reached his side, his glossed-over eyes and pale skin staring at me. Desmon was already dead.

Before any of us could say a word, a new sound emanated from the door. A low buzzer sound followed by the metallic clicking of the locking mechanism. We slowly rose to our feet, a cold chill running down my spine as I recognized the sound.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Peter whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying codes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt getting it right,‚Äù Markus turned to Peter, ‚ÄúMaybe they don‚Äôt know the override code.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt sticking around to find out,‚Äù Peter announced, ‚ÄúGet the pry-bar out of your tool kit.‚Äù

Peter took the tool from Markus and went to the opposite side of the room. He pushed the contents off the shelves in order to climb up to the large air vent. While he worked, I looked around the storage room for anything I might use as a weapon, eventually finding a small tool bag that contained an average-sized pocketknife. It wouldn‚Äôt do much, but it was something.

Using the pry-bar, Peter popped of the opening to the ventilation shaft before calling us over. We filed into the ventilation shaft. It was cool, cramped, and dark in the vents. The floor and walls creaked and squealed as we shimmy through them.

Where are we going?‚Äù Markus asked.

Peter looked down at his wrist monitor and scrolled along the map of the ship.

‚ÄúThere might be an air vent near the airlock,‚Äù Peter replied, ‚ÄúWe can shimmy back and get into our ship. We‚Äôll call command and let them deal with this.‚Äù

The trek back went by quickly. Adrenaline was still pumping through us all. As we moved along the vent, I heard the distinct sound of the generator kicking on. The ship‚Äôs electrical power appeared to have been restored. We could see light shining through slats up ahead that Peter pointed out as the vent near the airlock. Once we reached the exit vent, Peter froze as he looked through the slats of the vent.

‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

I looked through the slats to see a mass of infected humans huddled around the airlock entrance. Their bodies riddled with the pulsing holes of the ones before.

‚ÄúWhy the fuck are they here?‚Äù Markus asked quietly.

‚ÄúThey must have known we‚Äôd come back,‚Äù Peter whispered, his brow furrowed as he watched them.

Without warning, Peter drew back his fist and punched the side of the ventilation shaft. The loud bang caused Markus and I to jump in fear.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù Markus whispered.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Peter said plainly, pointing at the slats.

We looked out to see that the infected hadn‚Äôt moved, hadn‚Äôt reacted at all to the sudden loud noise.

""These vents make a lot of noise as we travel through the,"" Peter explained, his eyes narrowing, ""They would have heard us a while ago.""

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt they react?‚Äù Markus asked.

‚ÄúThe one we faced down the hall,‚Äù Peter replied, his voice no longer concealed in whispers, ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt react to us until the light flashed over its shoulder. Until there was a visual stimulus. I‚Ä¶ I think they‚Äôre deaf.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen how do you explain the horde coming down the hall once we started screaming?‚Äù Markus retorted.

‚ÄúMaybe they weren‚Äôt attracted by the sound. Maybe they have a way of communicating without talking.‚Äù

Peter‚Äôs finger slowly moved down the slats, pointing to the single large tendrils that extended out of each person and traveled down the hall in the same direction.

‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre right,‚Äù Markus continued, ‚Äúhow does that help us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù Peter answered, looking at his wrist monitor, ‚Äúbut we aren‚Äôt getting to the ship now. We need to make our way to the Rosen‚Äôs command center. We‚Äôll get communication back online and have Earth send help. Maybe we‚Äôll find someone who can give us some answers.‚Äù

We began working our way towards the command entrance of the ship. I could feel the shock of the situation wearing off, and a horrible dread setting in. I didn‚Äôt want to go further into the ship, I doubt any of us did, but what choice did we have?

We passed alongside one of the cramped engine rooms. I looked through the slats of the vent to see multiple infected people huddled in the room. Their grotesque bodies moved erratically against the machinery. Some seemed to be holding tools while others had their hands slapped onto monitors, their fingers snapping awkwardly as they appeared to type.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre they doing?‚Äù Markus asked.

We sat in silence for a long moment observing them before Peter‚Äôs shaky voice piped up.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to repair the ship.‚Äù

My eyes widened as I finally noticed what Peter had. It was rudimentary and wrong, like a child mimicking a mechanic, but he was right. They were trying to do maintenance.

‚ÄúHow is that possible?‚Äù Markus asked, ‚ÄúHow do they know to do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe they maintain some kind of memory,‚Äù Peter answered, ‚ÄúThey could be acting out repetitive actions. Same with trying the codes on the door, muscle memory.

‚ÄúWhy would they want to get the ship‚Äôs engines running?‚Äù Markus questioned, ‚ÄúWhere the hell do they plan to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter stopped himself.

I looked over at Peter. I could see his hands shaking. He was of team leader and was doing everything to maintain his composure, but I could see it on his face‚Ä¶ He was terrified.

‚ÄúWe need to make contact with command as soon as possible,‚Äù Peter whispered, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

We continued down the path. I followed Peter‚Äôs orders as he told me where to go at each fork in the vents. The map system on Peter‚Äôs wrist monitor didn‚Äôt show the ventilation tracks, but it allowed us a basic sense of direction when compared to the hallways and rooms we moved alongside. After a while, I could feel fatigue setting in. Crawling through the vents on my hands and knees was taking a toll on my body.

As we moved, the vents suddenly felt flimsy underneath me. Each movement was met with the metal plates flexing and buckling under our weight. A loud banging and creaking sound was let out with each advancement. We passed by a large set of slats that gave a great view of the outside area. I felt like my heart stopped as I looked out. We were suspended over a large mess hall. The chairs and tables had all been pushed out to the side, leaving the center of the room spacious and bare. There were many infected people in this room. They stood almost motionless, only giving a slight sway to each side.

They stood around a large object that was fastened in the center of the room. The thing in that room was a mass of horrible ruin. A large, viscous blob with large root-like extremities holding it to the floor. Its surface was a mix of deep red muscles, protruding bone, and hairy skin. Like the infected crew, the mass was covered in pulsing holes. Parts of the skin would expand and contract rhythmically, as though the mass was breathing. Off each rootlike structure sprouted hundreds of long red tendrils. Most were small and slowly writhed along the ground, but others were long, stretching out of the room completely. I looked at the people standing around the room, I could see a tendril attached to each of them. It extended out of their body and connected them to the mass.

Before any of us could say a word, we heard footsteps approaching from underneath us. We looked down to see two more infected people walking into the room. I heard Peter‚Äôs breath hitch as we saw them dragging Desmond‚Äôs lifeless body into the room.

Pulling him by his arms, the two infected held up his body before the mass. He had been stripped naked, and his injuries looked much more severe, appearing as though he had been mostly hollowed out. The smaller tendrils around the mass stood up and wiggled in the air as though they were being puppeted by a sick ventriloquist. We watched in horror as the tendrils grew in size and stretched out towards Desmond‚Äôs body, slithering into the holes. I felt sick as Desmond‚Äôs skin proceeded to deform and gyrate, like a blister stuffed with worms. The tendrils began breaking off of the mass and fully entering Desmond‚Äôs body. Our coworker‚Äôs corpse suddenly lurched back, his back bent to a point of almost breaking. His arms and legs erratically waved around, almost as though it was testing the body‚Äôs limits. I watched as a thicker tendril snaked its way out of Desmond‚Äôs leg and crawled along the floor before finally reuniting with the mass in the center of the room. Desmond‚Äôs body then turned and shambled underneath us, back in the direction he came.

We sat there in the vent, slack-jawed and pale. Some say there are things humans weren‚Äôt meant to see. I didn‚Äôt believe them until that moment.

‚ÄúL-let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter said before tapping my leg and pointing me forward.

I continued down the vent until the path made a sharp left turn. As I went around the corner, I stopped as I faced a tall metal wall.

The ventilation shaft extended upward about eight feet before continuing. I placed my back against the wall and began to pant. Peter shuffled up to where I was and looked up the shaft.

‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

¬†‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù Markus asked, ‚ÄúDo you think there is another way if we funnel back?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably not,‚Äù Peter answered while looking at his wrist monitor. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a small staircase up ahead that leads to the control room. The vents have to move up a level to reach it. We've got to get up there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Markus replied, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the game plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll lift you up,‚Äù Peter said as he looked at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the smallest of the three of us, so you‚Äôll go up first. After you‚Äôre up, Markus will lift me next. After I‚Äôm up top, I‚Äôll help pull Markus.‚Äù

Markus and I shared a glance. The metal floor beneath us creaked and groaned at every move. Could it really hold all that weight? Before we could protest, Peter‚Äôs words snapped our attention.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to wait. Stand up, let's get this over with.‚Äù

I stood and looked up at the ledge. It looked so far away in that moment. Peter grabbed me around the legs and lifted me. The metal creaked loudly, and I threw my arms over the ledge. I expected to feel my weight give out from under me at any moment. That I would crash down on the violent mess below us. I held my breath and kicked up Peter‚Äôs body as I pulled myself up to safety. I turned back and looked over the edge, giving a shaky thumbs-up. Peter sighed and closed his eyes for a moment.

‚ÄúAlright, Markus, lift me up.‚Äù

Markus stood up in the shaft and looked up at the ledge where I was. He sighed before bending down and grabbing Peter by the legs. I scooted back and stared at the ledge. After a few moments, I began to see Peter rise above the ledge, his arms grabbing at the rim. I smiled at Peter for a moment before a loud metallic pop caused me to jump. Peter‚Äôs eyes widened, and I watched his form suddenly drop below the ledge with a large crash. I could hear Peter groaning as all I could see were his hands gripping the ledge.

I crawled over and grabbed his wrists, looking over the edge to see that the vent panel had collapsed under the weight of Peter and Markus. Markus lay on the ground, calling out in pain. I adjusted my grip on Peter‚Äôs arms and tried pulling him up. I then saw infected swarm over Markus, his pained screams echoing through the metal vents. I pulled up on Peter as hard as I could, but I couldn‚Äôt lift him on my own.

‚ÄúTake the keycard!‚Äù Peter yelled, his face grimacing in fear.

I hesitated for a moment.

‚ÄúDamnit! Take it!‚Äù he ordered.

I quickly released his arms and lifted the keycard off his neck.

‚ÄúThe wrist monitor too,‚Äù He groaned, sweat beading on his head.

I reached down and unbuckled the monitor from his arm.

‚ÄúGet to the command deck. Send help. Don‚Äôt look back. I‚Äôll try getting away.‚Äù

I nodded my head and turned back, scrambling quickly down the vent. I heard the metal hum as Peter released his grip, followed by a loud thud. I crawled as fast as I could, even as the sounds of Peter‚Äôs screams filled the vent.

I followed the map the best I could, winding back and forth through the ship. As I drew closer to the command center, the more my fear grew, despite its crampedness, I wasn‚Äôt in danger. What happens if I reach the command room and it‚Äôs filled with infected? I couldn‚Äôt go back. I would be out of options. As I began the final stretch to the control room, the vent began to shrink tighter. I had to lie on my stomach and shimmy along the tight corridor, the light coming from the slats being my only guidance forward.

As I reached the slats, I let out a shaky sigh of relief. There was only one infected person in the room. It faced away from me, looking out the front window of the Rosen, as though it were looking out towards Earth. I pulled out the pocketknife and shimmied it between the vent and the wall. Using it as a makeshift pry bar, I loosened the grate enough to force it off the wall with a hard shove. Even with the knowledge that the infected couldn‚Äôt hear, I still shuddered as the grate clattered against the floor behind the hole-ridden man.

I slid out of the vent and landed on my hands and knees. I stood to my feet, my back aching from the constant crawling, and walked over to the command room entrance. I looked down the hall to see it completely empty. It was just me and the one crewmate. And I had the element of surprise.

Without warning, the ship suddenly rattled and shook, and many of the monitors suddenly beeped and blinked. I was confused for a moment before the realization dawned on me‚Ä¶ It was the feeling of the engines coming to life. I looked down to see the long tendril trailing from the crewmate‚Äôs leg back towards the mass in the mess hall. The infected in the room seemed to notice the sudden shake as well. I watched as the man slowly turned away from the window to face me, his eyes lighting up when he saw me.

Seizing the moment, I reached down and grabbed the tendril, sliding my pocketknife underneath it and slicing the tendril in two. Immediately, the crewmate in the room began to convulse and thrash about in a confused manner. I ran up to the infected man, bringing my leg up and planting my foot hard into his hole-ridden chest. The man toppled back and landed on his back. ¬†He thrashed about in a feeble attempt to get up. Before he could get his bearings, I brought the heel of my foot down on the man‚Äôs shins repeatedly, continuing until I heard the bones in each leg snap.

Once I was sure the man was incapacitated, I ran to the communication monitor and began scrolling through to reach command on Earth. As I began work on establishing a connection, my eyes locked onto an anomaly on the monitor‚Ä¶ The date was wrong.

The date on the monitor read two weeks from that moment. Was it a bug? Some sort of electrical malfunction when the ship went through the wormhole? Then I saw the logs. Multiple entries, repair reports, and ration orders set over the two weeks that hadn‚Äôt happened yet. The second-to-last report was a captain‚Äôs order, detailing that the Rosen would be ‚Äúlanding on the surface to allow the engines to cool‚Äù. This made no sense to me at the time. The Rosen was designed to travel long periods through space. For the engines to overheat would require a long-running flight in an atmosphere. On top of that, what surface is the captain referring to that the ship was supposed to land on? The ship had been in outer space for the past five months

I opened the final log, a crew maintenance report. As my eyes scanned the document, a cold chill like deep space itself ran over me.

‚ÄúI have sabotaged the engines. I don‚Äôt have much time; they are testing codes on the door. It will repair the engines eventually, but it will take them time. At the very least, it might buy enough time for someone else to figure out a way to stop it. If you are reading this, it knows about Earth, it longs for it. If it reaches our planet, it will spread. You see what it has done to us. We cannot let it get to our home. I pray this final act is not in vain. I love you, Samantha. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt be there for you and Jack.‚Äù

My breath was shaky; I could feel beads of sweat forming on my face. The thing was repairing the ship so it could get to Earth.

As I stared dumbfounded at the monitor. I suddenly heard footsteps approaching from behind. A large horde of the infected crew was shambling down the hall towards the command room, their corpse-like eyes locked onto me. At the front of the horde shambled Peter and Markus. Their broken bodies a sick mockery of the men I once knew.

I ran to the hanger door and quickly swiped the keycard and input the emergency code on the door monitor, shutting the large door and sending the command room into lockdown protocol. I could hear them banging on the door as I ran to the navigation module. I didn‚Äôt have time to call for help. Once they were in this room, it wouldn‚Äôt take them long until they steered the ship straight into Earth. They might just burn up in the atmosphere, or land somewhere deep in the ocean, but I could stake the world on that chance.

I opened the navigation module, pulling up a small depiction of our solar system in real time. I found the coordinates and hastily plugged them into the wormhole navigation system. The monitor on the door began to beep. They were testing codes now.

The ship rattled, and I heard the wormhole generator hum to life. I looked out the window, a small blue rock in a near-infinite universe. It was my home. I felt fear and grief roll over me as I realized I would never see it again.

Suddenly, Earth was gone, as was space. The ship now hovered about a mile over a surface of beautiful chaos. A plane that appeared to stretch out infinitely in all directions. A land that shifted in constant, unrecognizable patterns. It is made up of colors that are both familiar and indescribable. In the mess, I could see forests, mountains, and oceans all made up of alien features. land masses folding in on themselves and becoming something entirely new.

Beyond it all was a face. The visage of this world‚Ä¶ this universe. It isn‚Äôt something easily describable. I couldn‚Äôt see it, but I could feel it so strongly that I might as well have been looking into its eyes. A being that both existed in this world and was at the same time, the world in its entirety. The being was so beautiful, but it caused my eyes to burn. They bled, and I had to look away from it. This was where they were. The folded space between our own.

I crouched down and hid myself from the gaze of the world. The banging on the door has stopped. I suppose it realized I had taken it back to its home. It knows it lost; there is no point in hunting me now.

I believe it has been about a day since I entered this folded space. That's what the date on the monitor says, at least. It feels as though it has been longer. I figured I would try sending my story through the command message system. I doubt the message will send, and even if it does, I have no way of knowing where or when it might appear. Time doesn‚Äôt seem to make any sense in this place. Hopefully, someone will read this and put an end to the Rosen travel project.

I have kept myself locked in the command room. I don‚Äôt know why. It isn‚Äôt like I‚Äôll find a way to make it out of this ship alive. I sealed my fate when I put in those coordinates. I might be better off feeding myself to that thing in the mess hall. I don‚Äôt know how long it will take for the wormhole to spit us out the other end. But part of me wants to try and stay alive long enough to see the end. To be there when the thing realizes there's no escape for it. To watch its surprise as it withers away in searing pain as the metal it's attached to melts against its putrid flesh.

Years of overpopulation and resource shortages left our first planet stressed. Mars was seen as a pressure valve. A new planet for us to build up and eventually ruin. But we all knew it wasn‚Äôt a permanent solution. With the way our population grows, it would only give us a finite amount of time before we were in the same boat as before. We needed more planets. Planets that are farther away and host a greater abundance of resources.

To achieve this, humanity created a breakthrough. Using artificial gravity, we were able to bend space and create wormholes. This, in theory, would allow us to travel large distances instantaneously, spreading humanity throughout the cosmos.

After years of development, the first ever spacecraft with wormhole travel technology was developed. Initial unmanned tests were incredibly promising, and soon the first-ever manned wormhole trip was set to begin.

The ship, named the Rosen, was set out on a five-month voyage to travel from Earth to Mars. Once there, the crew of around 40 were set to activate the wormhole generator and travel back to Earth instantaneously. Everyone knew there were risks, but the developers and engineers were confident in their invention. The day came, and I remember staring at the monitor as the news reporter droned on about the historical president of the mission.

I drank my coffee from its pouch and watched as the countdown began. The camera changed to a split-screen satellite view of space. One half of the screen showed the Rosen sitting in orbit around Mars, and the second half was a view of space around Earth. When the countdown hit zero, the ship suddenly blinked between the two screens. In an instant, soundlessly, the massive ship traveled over 100 million miles.

While I heard the news reporter and people around her celebrating the massive achievement, I squinted my eyes at the screen, noticing the small details they didn‚Äôt. The ship had gone dark. The navigation lights seemed to have turned off as it passed through the wormhole. Furthermore, the engines looked cool, not emitting the normal blue glow that they normally do.

The automated door to my pod opened, and my coworker, Desmond, stuck his head in and grimaced.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna be needed up front,‚Äù Desmond said in his thick Irish accent.

I groaned and rolled out of the pod. Peering out the windows of the ship, I could see the Rosen sitting off in the distance. The ship sat in the same orbit of Earth as us, just as dark as it appeared on the screen. As I entered the command room of the ship. I could hear a loud rhythmic beeping coming from the communication panel. I could see Peter and Markus running remote diagnostics and communicating with our command team back on Earth.

‚ÄúGood to see you‚Äôre awake,‚Äù Peter chimed.

I yawned and nodded, gesturing to the control panel as it continued to loudly beep.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we're trying to figure out,‚Äù Markus said. ‚ÄúWhen the Rosen made the jump, it came out the other side blaring a distress signal. Despite the signal, we can‚Äôt reach the crew on coms for whatever reason. We called command, and they said the ship wasn‚Äôt distressed until it reached our side. And then there‚Äôs the ship going dark... Command is wondering if the jump didn‚Äôt have any unforeseen reaction with nuclear engines. Causing the blackout‚Ä¶ or some other electrical malfunction.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat ship has made how many unmanned jumps?‚Äù Desmond interrupted, ‚ÄúIt came out fine every other time. I‚Äôm telling ya, one of those pilots had a royal cock-up and caused this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, that doesn‚Äôt really matter now,‚Äù Peter said, taking off his communication headphones and walking away from the coms panel, ‚ÄúCommand told us to go in through the emergency airlock and provide assistance to the crew on getting the Rosen repaired. The sooner the better, they said.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck me,‚Äù Desmond said, throwing up his hands, ‚ÄúSo much for an easy paycheck.‚Äù

The ride over to the Rosen was incredibly short. I remember seeing the massive monolith of the ship towering over our small repair freighter. Despite the crew on board only numbering around 40, the ship itself was designed to support hundreds of passengers as well as their cargo. Our freighter shook violently as we docked into the airlock. Peter typed away on the panel by the large hatch, encrypting his keycard with the needed requirements to access restricted areas on the Rosen. The first set of doors opened, revealing the bright white interior of the airlock. The four of us stepped inside as the hatch behind us closed and the hatch into the Rosen opened.

The opening hallway of the Rosen was dark with the exception of small emergency lights illuminating the hallways and rooms.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think we‚Äôd be getting some kind of greeting,‚Äù Desmond muttered, ‚ÄúWe are saving their asses after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Peter said, clicking on his flashlight and looking at his map monitor on his wrist, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find someone and have them explain what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù

We traveled down the winding hallways of the massive ship, occasionally calling out but receiving no response. The eerie appearance of the empty ship began to settle on us. A palpable tension was building with every echoing footstep down the hall.

We rounded a corner to see a human figure standing at the end of the hallway. The figure was shrouded in the darkness that enveloped the whole ship, forbidding us from getting a good view.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Peter called out, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see another person on here. We were worried for a second.‚Äù

The figure didn‚Äôt move or speak, leaving us to sit in an awkward silence.

‚ÄúYou alright, sir?‚Äù Peter asked as he walked down the hallway.

I glanced over at Markus and Desmond, seeing the confused and worried expression that we were all sharing.

As Peter stepped closer, he was suddenly struck still as more of the man's features came into view of the light. He was completely naked and facing away from us. I felt my stomach churn at the sight of him. His entire body was covered in holes of all shapes and sizes. Some of the holes would slightly flex and wave like the muscles around them were contracting. He looked as though a corpse had been turned into a wasp nest. Inside each hole, I could see a small, white object that was surrounded by a fleshy red meat. As the light cast over his shoulder, the man slowly turned to face us, his face riddled with smaller holes.

‚ÄúHoly shit‚Ä¶‚Äù Desmond whispered as he stepped back.

The man‚Äôs eyes grew wide and wild as he began silently shambling towards us. Peter stretched out his arm and began backing away.

‚ÄúHey, man,‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sick, I‚Äôm gonna to need you to stand-‚Äù

Before he could finish, the man lunged forward headfirst, his arms flailing at his side as if he had no control over them. As he lunged, the holes in the man‚Äôs head produced deep, red tendrils. At the tips of each tendril were the white objects that I could now see were what looked like hooked porcupine quills. Peter dodged the incoming attack, and the man slammed onto the ground. Markus reared back to kick him, but Peter stopped him.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch him! Look!‚Äù Peter yelled, pointing to the holes on the man‚Äôs sides and back, now protruding those barbs.

Before an argument could be had, the man on the floor jumped to his feet and pounced on top of Desmond. We watched in horror as the tendrils shot from the man‚Äôs body and into Desmon‚Äôs flesh. Desmon screamed and attempted to push the man off of him, but it appeared the tendrils just pulled tighter and tighter. I watched as the tendrils would retract and shoot back out into Desmon‚Äôs skin, burrowing holes into his body. Peter and Markus stood back in shock and horror, not knowing what to do to get the man off of Desmon without being struck by the flailing barbs that rose from the man‚Äôs body.

Looking at the man, I noticed a detail I hadn‚Äôt seen before. Out of the man‚Äôs left leg, I noticed a long tendril that extended out of one of the holes and down the hall, rounding the corner. Without thinking, I dropped down to my hands and knees and grabbed hold of the long tendril.¬† It was warm and I could feel it pulsing in my hand, like a large vein. I tightened both hands around it and began pulling it apart. The vein flexed and stretched like a gummy worm before snapping with a sickening pop.

The man on Desmon suddenly flailed back, all of its tendrils retracting back into its body. The thing lurched to its feet; its arms still drooped at its sides. We prepared for another attack, but the man seemed to just walk aimlessly into the walls of the hallway, as though it was suddenly blind.

I was so focused on the man that I didn‚Äôt even notice Markus running up behind him. Markus raised up the large wrench he had retrieved from his tool pack and brought it down on the back of the man‚Äôs skull. The man fell to the ground, and Markus hit his head over and over. After a few hits, the man‚Äôs head was just a pile of mush, but his body was still struggling to get back up. I looked down to see Desmon bleeding profusely from his dozens of wounds. I knelt down beside him, but I knew there wasn‚Äôt anything I could do.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Peter mumbled under his breath.

I looked back to see six more people wandering down the hallway, all covered in holes.

‚ÄúWe need to get into a locked room, now,‚Äù Peter yelled, ‚ÄúGrab Desmond. Let‚Äôs go!‚Äù

Markus and I dropped to Desmond‚Äôs side, grabbing him by the shoulders and dragging him away from the approaching horde. Peter ran to the nearest room and placed his keycard on the scanner. The scanner dinged, and the door slid open.

We quickly pulled Desmon into the room, his screams of pain echoing down the hall and causing my ears to ring. Once on the inside, Peter used his keycard to shut the door, typing in a code on the scanner to activate the room's locking mechanism. I glanced around the room. Seeing that we had ended up in a large supply room. I quickly looked through the items at our disposal, searching for anything that could help Desmon‚Äôs injuries.

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that, Peter?‚Äù Markus said, kneeling by Desmond.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Peter murmured under his breath. We could hear the hoard outside, slapping their bodies against the door.

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ Was that the crew?‚Äù Markus‚Äôs voice shook.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Markus!‚Äù Peter shouted as he hovered his hands over Desmond‚Äôs mutilated body. ‚ÄúSome of these holes got through the rib cage. We need something to stop the bleeding.‚Äù

Desmon had stopped screaming by now; perhaps he had gone into shock. I found a small first aid kit and began running to Desmon‚Äôs side. Looking back, I should have known it wouldn‚Äôt do much to help; his wounds were too extensive, but holding that little white box filled me with so much hope. I froze when I reached his side, his glossed-over eyes and pale skin staring at me. Desmon was already dead.

Before any of us could say a word, a new sound emanated from the door. A low buzzer sound followed by the metallic clicking of the locking mechanism. We slowly rose to our feet, a cold chill running down my spine as I recognized the sound.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Peter whispered, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying codes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt getting it right,‚Äù Markus turned to Peter, ‚ÄúMaybe they don‚Äôt know the override code.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt sticking around to find out,‚Äù Peter announced, ‚ÄúGet the pry-bar out of your tool kit.‚Äù

Peter took the tool from Markus and went to the opposite side of the room. He pushed the contents off the shelves in order to climb up to the large air vent. While he worked, I looked around the storage room for anything I might use as a weapon, eventually finding a small tool bag that contained an average-sized pocketknife. It wouldn‚Äôt do much, but it was something.

Using the pry-bar, Peter popped of the opening to the ventilation shaft before calling us over. We filed into the ventilation shaft. It was cool, cramped, and dark in the vents. The floor and walls creaked and squealed as we shimmy through them.

Where are we going?‚Äù Markus asked.

Peter looked down at his wrist monitor and scrolled along the map of the ship.

‚ÄúThere might be an air vent near the airlock,‚Äù Peter replied, ‚ÄúWe can shimmy back and get into our ship. We‚Äôll call command and let them deal with this.‚Äù

The trek back went by quickly. Adrenaline was still pumping through us all. As we moved along the vent, I heard the distinct sound of the generator kicking on. The ship‚Äôs electrical power appeared to have been restored. We could see light shining through slats up ahead that Peter pointed out as the vent near the airlock. Once we reached the exit vent, Peter froze as he looked through the slats of the vent.

‚ÄúShit‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

I looked through the slats to see a mass of infected humans huddled around the airlock entrance. Their bodies riddled with the pulsing holes of the ones before.

‚ÄúWhy the fuck are they here?‚Äù Markus asked quietly.

‚ÄúThey must have known we‚Äôd come back,‚Äù Peter whispered, his brow furrowed as he watched them.

Without warning, Peter drew back his fist and punched the side of the ventilation shaft. The loud bang caused Markus and I to jump in fear.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù Markus whispered.

‚ÄúLook,‚Äù Peter said plainly, pointing at the slats.

We looked out to see that the infected hadn‚Äôt moved, hadn‚Äôt reacted at all to the sudden loud noise.

""These vents make a lot of noise as we travel through the,"" Peter explained, his eyes narrowing, ""They would have heard us a while ago.""

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt they react?‚Äù Markus asked.

‚ÄúThe one we faced down the hall,‚Äù Peter replied, his voice no longer concealed in whispers, ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt react to us until the light flashed over its shoulder. Until there was a visual stimulus. I‚Ä¶ I think they‚Äôre deaf.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen how do you explain the horde coming down the hall once we started screaming?‚Äù Markus retorted.

‚ÄúMaybe they weren‚Äôt attracted by the sound. Maybe they have a way of communicating without talking.‚Äù

Peter‚Äôs finger slowly moved down the slats, pointing to the single large tendrils that extended out of each person and traveled down the hall in the same direction.

‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre right,‚Äù Markus continued, ‚Äúhow does that help us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet,‚Äù Peter answered, looking at his wrist monitor, ‚Äúbut we aren‚Äôt getting to the ship now. We need to make our way to the Rosen‚Äôs command center. We‚Äôll get communication back online and have Earth send help. Maybe we‚Äôll find someone who can give us some answers.‚Äù

We began working our way towards the command entrance of the ship. I could feel the shock of the situation wearing off, and a horrible dread setting in. I didn‚Äôt want to go further into the ship, I doubt any of us did, but what choice did we have?

We passed alongside one of the cramped engine rooms. I looked through the slats of the vent to see multiple infected people huddled in the room. Their grotesque bodies moved erratically against the machinery. Some seemed to be holding tools while others had their hands slapped onto monitors, their fingers snapping awkwardly as they appeared to type.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre they doing?‚Äù Markus asked.

We sat in silence for a long moment observing them before Peter‚Äôs shaky voice piped up.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to repair the ship.‚Äù

My eyes widened as I finally noticed what Peter had. It was rudimentary and wrong, like a child mimicking a mechanic, but he was right. They were trying to do maintenance.

‚ÄúHow is that possible?‚Äù Markus asked, ‚ÄúHow do they know to do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe they maintain some kind of memory,‚Äù Peter answered, ‚ÄúThey could be acting out repetitive actions. Same with trying the codes on the door, muscle memory.

‚ÄúWhy would they want to get the ship‚Äôs engines running?‚Äù Markus questioned, ‚ÄúWhere the hell do they plan to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ Maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter stopped himself.

I looked over at Peter. I could see his hands shaking. He was of team leader and was doing everything to maintain his composure, but I could see it on his face‚Ä¶ He was terrified.

‚ÄúWe need to make contact with command as soon as possible,‚Äù Peter whispered, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

We continued down the path. I followed Peter‚Äôs orders as he told me where to go at each fork in the vents. The map system on Peter‚Äôs wrist monitor didn‚Äôt show the ventilation tracks, but it allowed us a basic sense of direction when compared to the hallways and rooms we moved alongside. After a while, I could feel fatigue setting in. Crawling through the vents on my hands and knees was taking a toll on my body.

As we moved, the vents suddenly felt flimsy underneath me. Each movement was met with the metal plates flexing and buckling under our weight. A loud banging and creaking sound was let out with each advancement. We passed by a large set of slats that gave a great view of the outside area. I felt like my heart stopped as I looked out. We were suspended over a large mess hall. The chairs and tables had all been pushed out to the side, leaving the center of the room spacious and bare. There were many infected people in this room. They stood almost motionless, only giving a slight sway to each side.

They stood around a large object that was fastened in the center of the room. The thing in that room was a mass of horrible ruin. A large, viscous blob with large root-like extremities holding it to the floor. Its surface was a mix of deep red muscles, protruding bone, and hairy skin. Like the infected crew, the mass was covered in pulsing holes. Parts of the skin would expand and contract rhythmically, as though the mass was breathing. Off each rootlike structure sprouted hundreds of long red tendrils. Most were small and slowly writhed along the ground, but others were long, stretching out of the room completely. I looked at the people standing around the room, I could see a tendril attached to each of them. It extended out of their body and connected them to the mass.

Before any of us could say a word, we heard footsteps approaching from underneath us. We looked down to see two more infected people walking into the room. I heard Peter‚Äôs breath hitch as we saw them dragging Desmond‚Äôs lifeless body into the room.

Pulling him by his arms, the two infected held up his body before the mass. He had been stripped naked, and his injuries looked much more severe, appearing as though he had been mostly hollowed out. The smaller tendrils around the mass stood up and wiggled in the air as though they were being puppeted by a sick ventriloquist. We watched in horror as the tendrils grew in size and stretched out towards Desmond‚Äôs body, slithering into the holes. I felt sick as Desmond‚Äôs skin proceeded to deform and gyrate, like a blister stuffed with worms. The tendrils began breaking off of the mass and fully entering Desmond‚Äôs body. Our coworker‚Äôs corpse suddenly lurched back, his back bent to a point of almost breaking. His arms and legs erratically waved around, almost as though it was testing the body‚Äôs limits. I watched as a thicker tendril snaked its way out of Desmond‚Äôs leg and crawled along the floor before finally reuniting with the mass in the center of the room. Desmond‚Äôs body then turned and shambled underneath us, back in the direction he came.

We sat there in the vent, slack-jawed and pale. Some say there are things humans weren‚Äôt meant to see. I didn‚Äôt believe them until that moment.

‚ÄúL-let‚Äôs go‚Ä¶‚Äù Peter said before tapping my leg and pointing me forward.

I continued down the vent until the path made a sharp left turn. As I went around the corner, I stopped as I faced a tall metal wall.

The ventilation shaft extended upward about eight feet before continuing. I placed my back against the wall and began to pant. Peter shuffled up to where I was and looked up the shaft.

‚ÄúFuck‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

¬†‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù Markus asked, ‚ÄúDo you think there is another way if we funnel back?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably not,‚Äù Peter answered while looking at his wrist monitor. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a small staircase up ahead that leads to the control room. The vents have to move up a level to reach it. We've got to get up there.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Markus replied, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the game plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll lift you up,‚Äù Peter said as he looked at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the smallest of the three of us, so you‚Äôll go up first. After you‚Äôre up, Markus will lift me next. After I‚Äôm up top, I‚Äôll help pull Markus.‚Äù

Markus and I shared a glance. The metal floor beneath us creaked and groaned at every move. Could it really hold all that weight? Before we could protest, Peter‚Äôs words snapped our attention.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to wait. Stand up, let's get this over with.‚Äù

I stood and looked up at the ledge. It looked so far away in that moment. Peter grabbed me around the legs and lifted me. The metal creaked loudly, and I threw my arms over the ledge. I expected to feel my weight give out from under me at any moment. That I would crash down on the violent mess below us. I held my breath and kicked up Peter‚Äôs body as I pulled myself up to safety. I turned back and looked over the edge, giving a shaky thumbs-up. Peter sighed and closed his eyes for a moment.

‚ÄúAlright, Markus, lift me up.‚Äù

Markus stood up in the shaft and looked up at the ledge where I was. He sighed before bending down and grabbing Peter by the legs. I scooted back and stared at the ledge. After a few moments, I began to see Peter rise above the ledge, his arms grabbing at the rim. I smiled at Peter for a moment before a loud metallic pop caused me to jump. Peter‚Äôs eyes widened, and I watched his form suddenly drop below the ledge with a large crash. I could hear Peter groaning as all I could see were his hands gripping the ledge.

I crawled over and grabbed his wrists, looking over the edge to see that the vent panel had collapsed under the weight of Peter and Markus. Markus lay on the ground, calling out in pain. I adjusted my grip on Peter‚Äôs arms and tried pulling him up. I then saw infected swarm over Markus, his pained screams echoing through the metal vents. I pulled up on Peter as hard as I could, but I couldn‚Äôt lift him on my own.

‚ÄúTake the keycard!‚Äù Peter yelled, his face grimacing in fear.

I hesitated for a moment.

‚ÄúDamnit! Take it!‚Äù he ordered.

I quickly released his arms and lifted the keycard off his neck.

‚ÄúThe wrist monitor too,‚Äù He groaned, sweat beading on his head.

I reached down and unbuckled the monitor from his arm.

‚ÄúGet to the command deck. Send help. Don‚Äôt look back. I‚Äôll try getting away.‚Äù

I nodded my head and turned back, scrambling quickly down the vent. I heard the metal hum as Peter released his grip, followed by a loud thud. I crawled as fast as I could, even as the sounds of Peter‚Äôs screams filled the vent.

I followed the map the best I could, winding back and forth through the ship. As I drew closer to the command center, the more my fear grew, despite its crampedness, I wasn‚Äôt in danger. What happens if I reach the command room and it‚Äôs filled with infected? I couldn‚Äôt go back. I would be out of options. As I began the final stretch to the control room, the vent began to shrink tighter. I had to lie on my stomach and shimmy along the tight corridor, the light coming from the slats being my only guidance forward.

As I reached the slats, I let out a shaky sigh of relief. There was only one infected person in the room. It faced away from me, looking out the front window of the Rosen, as though it were looking out towards Earth. I pulled out the pocketknife and shimmied it between the vent and the wall. Using it as a makeshift pry bar, I loosened the grate enough to force it off the wall with a hard shove. Even with the knowledge that the infected couldn‚Äôt hear, I still shuddered as the grate clattered against the floor behind the hole-ridden man.

I slid out of the vent and landed on my hands and knees. I stood to my feet, my back aching from the constant crawling, and walked over to the command room entrance. I looked down the hall to see it completely empty. It was just me and the one crewmate. And I had the element of surprise.

Without warning, the ship suddenly rattled and shook, and many of the monitors suddenly beeped and blinked. I was confused for a moment before the realization dawned on me‚Ä¶ It was the feeling of the engines coming to life. I looked down to see the long tendril trailing from the crewmate‚Äôs leg back towards the mass in the mess hall. The infected in the room seemed to notice the sudden shake as well. I watched as the man slowly turned away from the window to face me, his eyes lighting up when he saw me.

Seizing the moment, I reached down and grabbed the tendril, sliding my pocketknife underneath it and slicing the tendril in two. Immediately, the crewmate in the room began to convulse and thrash about in a confused manner. I ran up to the infected man, bringing my leg up and planting my foot hard into his hole-ridden chest. The man toppled back and landed on his back. ¬†He thrashed about in a feeble attempt to get up. Before he could get his bearings, I brought the heel of my foot down on the man‚Äôs shins repeatedly, continuing until I heard the bones in each leg snap.

Once I was sure the man was incapacitated, I ran to the communication monitor and began scrolling through to reach command on Earth. As I began work on establishing a connection, my eyes locked onto an anomaly on the monitor‚Ä¶ The date was wrong.

The date on the monitor read two weeks from that moment. Was it a bug? Some sort of electrical malfunction when the ship went through the wormhole? Then I saw the logs. Multiple entries, repair reports, and ration orders set over the two weeks that hadn‚Äôt happened yet. The second-to-last report was a captain‚Äôs order, detailing that the Rosen would be ‚Äúlanding on the surface to allow the engines to cool‚Äù. This made no sense to me at the time. The Rosen was designed to travel long periods through space. For the engines to overheat would require a long-running flight in an atmosphere. On top of that, what surface is the captain referring to that the ship was supposed to land on? The ship had been in outer space for the past five months

I opened the final log, a crew maintenance report. As my eyes scanned the document, a cold chill like deep space itself ran over me.

‚ÄúI have sabotaged the engines. I don‚Äôt have much time; they are testing codes on the door. It will repair the engines eventually, but it will take them time. At the very least, it might buy enough time for someone else to figure out a way to stop it. If you are reading this, it knows about Earth, it longs for it. If it reaches our planet, it will spread. You see what it has done to us. We cannot let it get to our home. I pray this final act is not in vain. I love you, Samantha. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt be there for you and Jack.‚Äù

My breath was shaky; I could feel beads of sweat forming on my face. The thing was repairing the ship so it could get to Earth.

As I stared dumbfounded at the monitor. I suddenly heard footsteps approaching from behind. A large horde of the infected crew was shambling down the hall towards the command room, their corpse-like eyes locked onto me. At the front of the horde shambled Peter and Markus. Their broken bodies a sick mockery of the men I once knew.

I ran to the hanger door and quickly swiped the keycard and input the emergency code on the door monitor, shutting the large door and sending the command room into lockdown protocol. I could hear them banging on the door as I ran to the navigation module. I didn‚Äôt have time to call for help. Once they were in this room, it wouldn‚Äôt take them long until they steered the ship straight into Earth. They might just burn up in the atmosphere, or land somewhere deep in the ocean, but I could stake the world on that chance.

I opened the navigation module, pulling up a small depiction of our solar system in real time. I found the coordinates and hastily plugged them into the wormhole navigation system. The monitor on the door began to beep. They were testing codes now.

The ship rattled, and I heard the wormhole generator hum to life. I looked out the window, a small blue rock in a near-infinite universe. It was my home. I felt fear and grief roll over me as I realized I would never see it again.

Suddenly, Earth was gone, as was space. The ship now hovered about a mile over a surface of beautiful chaos. A plane that appeared to stretch out infinitely in all directions. A land that shifted in constant, unrecognizable patterns. It is made up of colors that are both familiar and indescribable. In the mess, I could see forests, mountains, and oceans all made up of alien features. land masses folding in on themselves and becoming something entirely new.

Beyond it all was a face. The visage of this world‚Ä¶ this universe. It isn‚Äôt something easily describable. I couldn‚Äôt see it, but I could feel it so strongly that I might as well have been looking into its eyes. A being that both existed in this world and was at the same time, the world in its entirety. The being was so beautiful, but it caused my eyes to burn. They bled, and I had to look away from it. This was where they were. The folded space between our own.

I crouched down and hid myself from the gaze of the world. The banging on the door has stopped. I suppose it realized I had taken it back to its home. It knows it lost; there is no point in hunting me now.

I believe it has been about a day since I entered this folded space. That's what the date on the monitor says, at least. It feels as though it has been longer. I figured I would try sending my story through the command message system. I doubt the message will send, and even if it does, I have no way of knowing where or when it might appear. Time doesn‚Äôt seem to make any sense in this place. Hopefully, someone will read this and put an end to the Rosen travel project.

I have kept myself locked in the command room. I don‚Äôt know why. It isn‚Äôt like I‚Äôll find a way to make it out of this ship alive. I sealed my fate when I put in those coordinates. I might be better off feeding myself to that thing in the mess hall. I don‚Äôt know how long it will take for the wormhole to spit us out the other end. But part of me wants to try and stay alive long enough to see the end. To be there when the thing realizes there's no escape for it. To watch its surprise as it withers away in searing pain as the metal it's attached to melts against its putrid flesh. When the Rosen reaches its final destination, the surface of the sun.",1,1752758882.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False

1m27iic,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m27iic/does_the_keurig_kelite_coffee_maker_truly_deliver/,Does the Keurig K-Elite Coffee Maker Truly Deliver Premium Brews?,"I‚Äôve been using the Keurig K-Elite for a couple of months now, and as someone who takes coffee seriously, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. At a glance, the brushed silver finish immediately struck me as sleek and modern, and it felt like the perfect addition to my somewhat minimalist kitchen. I‚Äôll admit, I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with single-serve coffee makers‚Äîon one hand, they‚Äôre incredibly convenient, but on the other, I tend to miss the ritual of freshly ground coffee beans. Still, the K-Elite promised a lot with its features, and I was curious to see if it could deliver. From its strong brew button to its iced coffee-setting and all the programmable bells and whistles, I was ready to put it to the test.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is definitely where the K-Elite shines. Its relatively compact dimensions (9.9""D x 12.7""W x 13.1‚ÄùH) make it an easy fit for almost any countertop, while the brushed silver metal gives it a premium, sturdy look. The machine doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy or cheap‚Äîit has some heft to it, at 8 pounds, which makes it seem like it‚Äôs built to last. The buttons on the control panel are intuitive, tactile, and easy to navigate, even first thing in the morning when all I can think about is caffeine. Whether I was selecting the brew strength or switching to the iced coffee setting, the interface ensured I wasn‚Äôt fumbling, even on autopilot.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
One of my favorite things about this coffee maker is how ridiculously user-friendly it is. You don‚Äôt need an engineering degree to figure it out, which is something I can‚Äôt say for all appliances. It offers five different brew sizes (4, 6, 8, 10, and 12oz), and the large 75-ounce removable water reservoir really came in clutch on busy mornings. The reservoir capacity means you won‚Äôt spend half your week refilling it, and it pops out easily when it does need a top-up. I find that level of convenience hard to beat, especially when dealing with the chaotic juggle of work and making sure everyone in the house is caffeinated.

[Check Keurig K-Elite price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0788f3r8x/)

**Performance and Flavor Options**  
Here‚Äôs the big question‚Äîdoes it make good coffee? Honestly, I was surprised. I expected your run-of-the-mill single-serve brew, but the Strong Brew button cranks up the flavor intensity, giving you a much bolder and flavorful cup. My mornings were often made better with a few hit-and-miss experiments using different K-Cup pods and even ground coffee, thanks to the reusable filter option. I also tried the iced coffee button, which brewed hot coffee directly over ice without watering it down‚Äîsomething my partner, who prefers iced lattes, totally appreciated. Plus, the temperature control allowed me to tweak the heat level within the 187¬∞F to 192¬∞F range, which felt like a fun feature for an amateur coffee enthusiast like me.

**Advantages**  
- Convenient 75-ounce water reservoir reduces frequent refills.  
- Strong Brew button delivers bold, caf√©-like coffee intensity.  
- The iced coffee setting works efficiently, especially for hot summer days.  

**Negatives**  
- The included reusable filter is sold separately, which I found pretty inconvenient.  
- It‚Äôs a bit noisy during operation, especially when brewing larger cup sizes.  

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
No one loves cleaning, but Keurig kept things simple here. The removable drip tray makes it easy to clean up accidental spills, and even my gargantuan 7.2-inch travel mug fits securely when the tray is removed. Additionally, this machine comes equipped with a brewer maintenance reminder, so there‚Äôs no excuse not to descale it when needed. I‚Äôll admit I ignored this reminder once, and the coffee tasted a bit off afterward. Lesson learned‚Äîdescale regularly, folks.

**Product Competitors**  
Naturally, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare the K-Elite with other contenders like the Nespresso VertuoPlus and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. While the Nespresso impressed me with its espresso options, it doesn‚Äôt offer the customization and versatility of the K-Elite, especially for different cup sizes. The FlexBrew, on the other hand, has a dual brewing system for pods and ground coffee but feels bulkier and lacks the iced coffee setting. When balancing features against convenience, the K-Elite strikes me as an almost perfect middle-ground option.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Although the K-Elite falls into the slightly higher price range of single-serve coffee makers, the wealth of customizable features, durability, and stylish build justify its value. Sure, there are cheaper options out there, but they often skimp on quality or versatility. This machine feels like an investment, and if you‚Äôre someone who enjoys tailoring each cup to your taste or experimenting with coffee options, it truly earns its spot.

By noon, I‚Äôd feel completely drained, and to push myself to keep working, I had to promise myself a candy bar or another cup of coffee.

That got me thinking: what if I gave up coffee and sugar completely? Would my energy levels stabilize? How would my body react to the absence of those dopamine swings?

The mechanism is pretty simple: when we drink coffee or eat something sweet, our body gets a short burst of energy ‚Äî followed by a crash. Imagine a sharp peak on a graph.

I switched to tea and started eating a bit of dark chocolate and fruit instead.

If you fly American Airlines even a couple of times a year, the Barclays Aviator Red card might be a low-effort win.

üõ´ Best Part? The sign-up bonus is crazy easy. You typically get 60k AAdvantage miles after just one purchase (and paying the $99 annual fee). Buy a coffee and boom ‚Äî miles in your account, this is by far the easiest SUB.

üíº Perks include:
	‚Ä¢	First checked bag free for you + 4 companions
	‚Ä¢	Preferred boarding (Group 5)
	‚Ä¢	25% off in-flight food and drinks
	‚Ä¢	Flight Cents round-up to earn more miles
	‚Ä¢	No foreign transaction fees

üéØ Downsides:
	‚Ä¢	No bonus categories for spend (just 2x AA, 1x everything else)
	‚Ä¢	$99 annual fee (but easily offset with the checked bag perk)

I mainly use this card for the welcome bonus and the free bag perk when flying AA. Not my everyday spender, but it earns its spot in my wallet.

Anyone else using this card? Or do you prefer the Citi AA cards instead?

Today I got kinda bonked on the head walking into work with my ""usual"" look: work shirt, scrub pants, socks, Crocs, hair in a weird messy bun. Coffee in one hand, keys and badge and breakfast in the other. I do not wear makeup and I usually quickly wash my face and apply sunscreen moisturizer (Trader Joe's brand lol) in the AM before coming in.

I turn the corner in the garage and I pass a few people (younger nurses, looking cute in their brand name scrubs) mingling by the door waiting for the elevator and do the universal ""raise the coffee salutations"". As I'm walking away one of the girls says to the other ""ooo she's a jump scare"" and they both giggle. 

Kind of a bummer for me because for like 15 years I haven't given a shit about what people think but that comment made me really sad! I don't think I look *awful*. 

Dehydrated, yes. Tired, yes. Probably gaunt because I prefer night shift to day shift, yes. 

But never, and I mean NeVeR have I had someone comment on my looks in that manner (at least within earshot, anyway!)

Anyway now I'm like ah shit, when was the last time I had a haircut? Hydrated properly? Relaxed? Fully moisturized? Ate something balanced? Worked out? And why is all of it so much effort?

Anyway, just wanted to be crabs in a bucket for a minute and vent. I'll likely never see those kids again, but it was a bit of a spiral so now I'm spending my downtime working on a revamped grocery list, skincare list, and filling up my water bottle, lol.

Have a good day y'all, make sure to wear sunscreen! üåû",10,1752758511.0,30PlusSkinCare,2,1.0,False
1m27ei3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1m27ei3/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/,"No game today, so let's remember a forgotten Yankee: Deron Johnson","> ""I thought Deron Johnson was going to be a superstar. I played with him at Binghamton and it was like a man playing among boys. He was 18 years old and this guy was a stud. I thought he would hit 40 home runs a year."" -- Lee Thomas, Yankee prospect from 1954 to 1961 who later became GM of the Philadelphia Phillies 
 
Happy birthday to [Deron Johnson](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/I5UAAOSwzV1i4~Vt/s-l1200.jpg), one of several ""the next great Yankee"" prospects in New York's farm system in the 1950s who went on to star elsewhere. 
 
Between 1947 and 1964, the Yankees won 10 World Series and won 15 pennants... *and* had these guys trapped in the minors: 
  
C **Sherm Lollar** - Yankee farm system from 1947 to 1948, 72 plate appearances with the Yankees across two seasons; eight-time All-Star, three-time Gold Glove winner with Chicago White Sox. 
 
C **Gus Triandos** - Yankee farm system from 1948 to 1954, 56 plate appearances with the Yankees across two seasons; four-time All-Star with the Baltimore Orioles. 
 
C **Clint Courtney** - Yankee farm system from 1947 to 1951, 3 plate appearances with the Yankees; runner-up as ROY with the St. Louis Browns in 1952 after hitting .286/.349/.395 in 458 plate appearances. 
 
1B **Vic Power** - Yankee farm system from 1952 to 1953, never played for Yankees; six-time All-Star, seven-time Gold Glove winner in a 12-year major league career. 
 
1B **Mike Hegan** - Yankee farm system from 1962 to 1968, 399 plate appearances with the Yankees spread across five seasons; All-Star with the Seattle Pilots in 1969, hitting .292/.427/.461. 
 
2B **Jerry Lumpe** - Yankee farm system from 1951 to 1957, 496 plate appearances with the Yankees spread across four seasons; hit .301/.341/.432 in 700 plate appearances with the Kansas City A's in 1962, All-Star with the Detroit Tigers in 1964. 
 
OF **Jackie Jensen** - Yankee farm system from 1950 to 1952, 289 plate appearances with the Yankees spread over three seasons; 1958 MVP, two-time All-Star with Red Sox. 
 
OF **Bill Virdon** - Yankee farm system from 1950 to 1953, never played for Yankees; 1955 Rookie of the Year with the St. Louis Cardinals; later served as Yankees manager, 1974-1975. 
 
OF **Lee Thomas** -- Yankee farm system from 1954 to 1961, 2 plate appearances with Yankees; two-time All-Star with Angels, hit .271/.361/.464 (128 OPS+) in 603 plate appearances for Red Sox in 1965. 

OF **Whitey Herzog** - Yankee prospect from 1949 to 1955, never played for Yankees; hit .291/.387/.409 in 377 plate appearances for Baltimore Orioles in 1961, then won three pennants and a World Series as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals. 
 
P **Lew Burdette** - Yankee farm system from 1947 to 1951, 1 1/3 innings pitched with Yankees; 203-144 in an 18-year career, three-time All-Star with Milwaukee Braves. 
 
P **Bob Porterfield** - Yankee farm system from 1946 to 1951, 158 1/3 innings with the Yankees spread across four seasons; won 22 games with the Senators in 1953 and was an All-Star in 1954. 
 
P **Ernie Broglio** - Yankee farm system in 1954, never pitched for Yankees; went 21-9 with a majors-leading 7.1 bWAR in 1960. 
 
P **Bob Keegan** - Yankee farm system from 1946 to 1951, never pitched for Yankees in majors; All-Star with the White Sox in 1954 after going 16-9 with a 3.09 ERA (122 ERA+) 
 
P **Cal McLish** - Yankee farm system in 1947, never pitched for Yankees; 15-year career, All-Star with the Cleveland Indians in 1959 after going 19-8 with a 3.63 ERA. 
 
Add [Deron Roger Johnson](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/johnsde01.shtml) to that list. After five years as one of the top prospects in the Yankee farm system, Johnson only got 26 plate appearances split over two seasons before being sent off in the latest -- and as it turned out, last -- of the 16 trades made between Kansas City and New York between 1955 and 1961. 
 
Johnson then enjoyed a long career that included a majors-leading 130 RBI season as well as a World Series ring with the 1973 Oakland A's. 
 
Born July 17, 1938, in San Diego, California, Johnson was an All-American end at San Diego High School. (He also played linebacker, kicker, and punter!) In 1955, he scored 15 touchdowns and led San Diego to the Southern California championship. ""The easiest kid to coach you‚Äôve ever met,"" his high school coach said. ""If he has a bad habit, it‚Äôs escaped me."" 
 
Johnson had numerous scholarship offers to play football, including one from Notre Dame, as well as lots of interest from major league teams. Other teams offered more money, but Johnson picked the Yankees and their $1,000 bonus, possibly *because* it was lower than the offers from other teams -- if he signed for a $4,000 bonus or more, he would be a ""Bonus Baby"" and be required to spend his first two seasons on a major league roster. While this path proved successful for Al Kaline, Harmon Killebrew, Catfish Hunter, Roberto Clemente, and Sandy Koufax, there were many more youngsters who had their careers derailed by the lack of development as the last man on the major league roster, rather than playing every day in the minors. 
 
Johnson was confident enough in his abilities that he thought he'd be in the majors soon enough. Making his professional debut at age 17 with the Kearney Yankees in the Nebraska State League in 1956, he hit an impressive .329/.469/.687 with 24 home runs and 78 RBIs in just 63 games; the next year he was moved up to Binghamton in the Eastern League, and hit .303/.397/.557 with 26 home runs, 13 triples, and 102 RBIs in 137 games. Casey Stengel said the 18-year-old Johnson reminded him of the 18-year-old Mickey Mantle, who coincidentally hit 26 home runs and 12 triples in 137 games with the Joplin Miners in 1950. (Though Mantle hit .383 that year.) 
 
Johnson reached the Yankees' top farm team, the Richmond Virginians, in 1958. He was just 19 years old and looked like one of the brightest stars in the star-studded Yankee minors. And there he was stuck for three seasons, despite hitting .261/.336/.466 with 79 home runs and 285 RBIs in 459 games. The Yankees just had too many good players in the majors, with guys who would be regulars on any other team -- Elston Howard, Hector Lopez, Norm Siebern, Bob Cerv, Johnny Blanchard, Andy Carey -- fighting for at-bats. 
 
Finally, entering the 1960 season, it appeared an infield spot was available -- but another prospect slipped in ahead of him. 
 
Clete Boyer's career was almost the opposite of Johnson's. Boyer, like Johnson, was a two-sport star in high school, though his other sport was basketball. And he too was pursued by numerous major league teams, including the Yankees and the A's. Like Johnson, the Yankees offered Boyer a modest bonus and the promise of playing every day in the minors in order to work his way up the ladder; the A's offered a huge $35,000 bonus with the caveat he'd spend two years on the bench in the majors.
 
Johnson took the former route; Boyer the latter, signing with the A's as a Bonus Baby. Later there were rumors that this was all a ruse; that the Yankees and A's had an agreement where Boyer would sit on their bench for two years, rather than take the spot of a veteran on the Yankees, then be traded to New York once he could be assigned to a minor league team. 
 
True or not, that's what happened. Boyer, just 18 years old, spent his first two seasons on the major league bench with the A's, getting a grand total of 208 at-bats. Then, on June 4, 1957, he was the player-to-be-named-later in a 10-player deal that the Yankees and A's had made that off-season. 
 
Boyer and Johnson were teammates for the next three seasons in the minors. When the Yankees needed another infielder for the 1960 season, they had a classic dilemma: Johnson was the better hitter, Boyer had the better glove. 
 
The Yankees went with Boyer. He hit just .242/.285/.405 (89 OPS+) in 431 plate appearances, but made up for it with the leather: In his 16-year career, Boyer led his league in total zone runs as a third baseman five times, and finished in the top five another five times; all time, he ranks fourth in total zone runs as a third baseman, behind only Brooks Robinson, Adrian Beltre, and Buddy Bell, and ahead of Robin Ventura, Scott Rolen, and Graig Nettles. 
  
With first base already occupied by Moose Skowron, right field by Roger Maris, and left field a mish-mosh of Yogi Berra, Hector Lopez, and Bob Cerv, there was nowhere to play Johnson. He spent a third straight season in Triple A, hitting .245/.326/.455 with 27 home runs in 627 plate appearances. (That's a little better than it looks; league average that year in the International league was .248/.318/.373.) Getting a September call-up, he got into five games off the bench and went 2-for-4. His first major league hit came in the final game of the season, a fifth inning double off Boston's Jerry Casale, followed by a single in the seventh.
 
In 1961, Boyer was still the starter at third base, but Johnson made the Opening Day roster thanks to the retirement of [previously forgotten Yankee Gil McDougald](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/1kqevta/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/). In the April 10, 1961 issue of *Sports Illustrated*, Johnson was listed as the top backup at first and third. 
 
Boyer got off to a brutal start, getting just two hits in his first 23 at-bats of the season, and finally on April 24 was benched for Johnson. Deron got two hits in three games, but then the Yankees switched back to Boyer, who hit .409/.480/.591 in a 12-game hitting streak, and .297/.407/.440 for the month of May.
 
Johnson would never make another start as a Yankee.
 
Boyer cooled off considerably over the second half, hitting .227, but it was too late for Johnson. He would be the latest -- and one of the last -- Yankees traded to their ""major league farm team,"" the Kansas City Athletics.
 
The Philadelphia A's were purchased after the 1954 season by Arnold Johnson, a real estate developer who owned Yankee Stadium. The sale required the approval of the other American League teams, and Yankee owners Dan Topping and Del Webb went to bat for him, lobbying the other owners to approve it. 
 
Then Johnson wanted to move the A's to Kansas City; the Yankees, who had a minor league team there, could block it. They didn't, and moved the minor league team to Denver. 
 
In return, Johnson sold Yankee Stadium to Topping and Webb, but that's not all. Over the next six years, the Yankees and A's made 15 trades, almost all of them in favor of New York. 
 
It was so bad that, when Charlie Finley bought the Kansas City A's prior to the 1961 season, he promised the fans he would put an end to the Kansas City-New York pipeline. ""I don't care what the Yankees offer,"" Finley said. ""I wouldn't even trade our two bat boys for Mickey Mantle."" 
 
Always theatrical, Finley got an old school bus, labeled it ""Kansas City to New York shuttle,"" and set it on fire outside the Municipal Stadium parking lot! 
 
On June 9, 1961, he reiterated that promise: ""I gave the fans in Kansas City my word that we would not trade with the Yankees, and my word is my bond."" 
 
Just five days after the announcement, on June 14, A's GM Frank Lane made a 16th trade with New York: Johnson and pitcher Art Ditmar to Kansas City for veteran lefty Bud Daley. 
 
> ""When Finley pulled that bush-league trick of burning the charter bus to Yankee Stadium and announcing he wouldn't even trade the A's batboy for Mickey Mantle, I was determined to make a deal if I could. I told Finley at the start not to make those stupid promises that he would never deal with the Yankees. I deal with any club and always have. And if he hadn't interfered, I would have made a better deal with the Yanks than the one we finally made."" -- Frank Lane 
 
Soon after the deal, Finley fired Lane... and the two franchises wouldn't make another trade for four years!
 
On paper, the trade was a good one for the Yankees, as were almost all the others. But a closer look revealed maybe the Yankees shouldn't have made it. 
 
Daley, an All-Star for the A's in 1959 and 1960, went 8-9 in 129 2/3 innings as a swingman for the Yankees in 1961 and pitched seven innings in the World Series that year without allowing an earned run. Returning to the Yankees in 1962, he went 7-5 in 105 1/3 innings, and then had a scoreless inning in that year's World Series. He then pitched briefly for the Yankees in 1964, posting a 4.63 ERA in 35 innings; he was then traded to Cleveland, but never pitched for them, and retired after he was released. In four seasons with the Yankees, he was worth 0.7 bWAR. 
 
Ditmar, who had gone 47-32 with a 3.24 ERA (112 ERA+) in five years with the Yankees, was washed up; he went 0-7 in two seasons with Kansas City and was released in 1962; he then signed a minor-league deal with the Yankees and was a non-roster invitee in spring training in 1963, but retired after not making the team. His stint with the A's was -0.5 bWAR. 
 
As for Johnson, the A's turned him into a super-sub style player, with 303 plate appearances spread across five different positions, but he hit just .216/.252/.360. Immediately after the season was over, he was called into active duty with the U.S. Army, and served until the following July. He returned to the A's on August 1 and had just two hits in 19 at-bats over the remainder of the season. The following spring training, the A's sold his contract to the Cincinnati Reds. He was worth a grand total of -1.5 bWAR with the Kansas City A's. 
 
But while the Yankees came out a little ahead in terms of bWAR, 0.7 to -2.0, in the long run the Yankees would have been better off keeping Johnson. He would have been the perfect platoon partner at first base with the left-handed Joe Pepitone after Skowron's trade to the Dodgers after the 1962 season; then he could have filled the black hole at third base created when the Yankees traded Boyer to the Braves after the 1966 season. Between Clete Boyer in 1966 and Graig Nettles in 1973, the Yankees had a different Opening Day starter at third base for six straight seasons: Charley Smith, Mike Ferraro, Bobby Murcer, Danny Cater, Jerry Kenney, and Rich McKinney. 
 
But instead of the Bronx, Johnson's prime years were spent in Cincinnati and Philadelphia. 
 
When first acquired by the Reds, they sent Johnson home to San Diego, where he played a season in the Pacific Coast League. Playing for Don ""Jeep"" Heffner, a Yankee infielder from 1934 to 1937, Johnson hit .277/.346/.541 with 33 home runs and 91 RBIs in 129 games. 
 
Back in the majors the following spring, Johnson finally established himself as a major league regular. In four seasons with the Reds he hit .264/.316/.467 (114 OPS+) while playing first, third, and left field; in 1965, he led the majors with 130 runs batted in. Had he been on the Yankees in 1965, Johnson also would have led the team in bWAR (4.0), hits (177), doubles (30), triples (7), home runs (32), batting average (.287), slugging percentage (.515), OPS (.854), and total bases (317)! 
 
Pitcher Joe Nuxhall had been Johnson's teammate on the 1961 A's, and was reunited with him on the Reds from 1964 to 1966. He said Johnson had evolved from a pull-happy, swing-from-your-heels approach to a more balanced hitter, able to drive the ball to all fields. 
 
After the 1967 season, Johnson was traded to the Braves to be their starting first baseman. It proved to be a disaster. Struggling to play through injuries, Johnson hit just .208 with eight home runs in 383 plate appearances. He was 29 years old and looked washed; the Braves sold him to the Phillies. Healthy again, he had four good years there, hitting .251/.333/.442 (115 OPS+) in 2,161 plate appearances. Early in the 1973 season, the Phillies traded him back to the A's, now in Oakland. 
 
The American League now had the Designated Hitter, and at last Johnson had a defined role. 
 
> ‚ÄúDeron Johnson is the DH we‚Äôve been looking for.‚Äù -- A's manager Dick Williams 
 
Playing just about every day, Johnson hit .246/.330/.407 in 530 plate appearances, with 19 home runs and 81 runs batted in. Unfortunately for Johnson, the World Series that year didn't have a DH, even in the American League ballpark -- it wouldn't be allowed in the World Series until 1976, and then only in even-numbered years until 1986, when the DH was allowed when the A.L. was the home team. He went 2-for-3 with a walk in four pinch-hit appearances over the first five games, then started at first base in the final two games, singling off Tom Seaver in Game 6 as the A's beat Yogi Berra's Mets in seven games. 
 
Johnson returned to the A's the following season but, nagged by a lingering thumb injury, was hitting just .195 in 188 plate appearances at the end of June. Oakland traded him to the Milwaukee Brewers. There he hit .151/.253/.289 in 174 PAs, and they sold him to Boston. He hit .120 with two RBIs in 11 games. 
 
Just when it seemed like his career was over, Johnson signed with the White Sox on April 5, 1975, and though he hit just .232, his 18 home runs and 72 RBIs led the team. In September, with Jim Rice out with a broken hand, the Red Sox traded for Johnson to finish out the season. He went 6-for-10 with a home run in three games. The following year he returned to Boston, but after going 5-for-38 (.132) he was released, and retired a month shy of his 38th birthday. 
 
After his playing days were over, Johnson was a minor league manager, then a major league hitting coach with the Angels, Phillies, Mariners, and White Sox. In 1988, Johnson was a hitting instructor with the Yankees' Double A team in Albany; years later, Kevin Maas named Johnson as one of the most influential batting coaches he'd had.
 
In 1991, the long-time smoker was diagnosed with lung cancer, and he died 10 months later. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and a daughter. 
 
**Take A Closer Look At This Johnson** 
 
* The only nickname I could find for Johnson is an obvious one: ""D.J."" 
 
* There have been many guys with the last name Johnson in the majors, but he is the only player in major league history with the first name Deron. 
 
* Deron could be French for ""Desirable,"" Gaelic for ""Valley Wanderer,"" or Armenian for ""Belonging to God."" It was never a very popular name; it ranked as the 464th most popular boys' name in 1966, and has only dropped off since then. Deron Williams was the third overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft and was a three-time All-Star; there's also Deron Mayo, Jerod Mayo's little brother, who played in the Canadian Football League and is now the strength and conditioning coach with the New England Patriots. 
 
* Johnson played for eight organizations in his 16 year career, but it wasn't because he was a problem player; teammates seemed universal in their praise for him. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs the greatest professional athlete I ever met as far as attitude,‚Äù Phillies shortstop and future Yankee third base coach Larry Bowa once said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got more respect for him than anybody in baseball. He‚Äôs a super individual.‚Äù 
 
* Johnson only played in one World Series, in 1973, but he also was on four other teams that reached a World Series -- the Yankees in 1960 and 1961, the A's in 1974, and the Red Sox in 1975. 
 
* On [July 11, 1971](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI197107110.shtml), Johnson homered in three consecutive at-bats against the Expos -- a two-run home run in the second inning, a two-run shot in the third inning, and a solo home run in the sixth inning. He said that day and playing in the World Series were the greatest thrills he had as a ballplayer. 
 
* The trade that sent Johnson to the A's for Bud Daley almost didn't happen. The A's had a deal in place of Daley to the White Sox for a 24-year-old lefty named Juan Pizarro. But in what would have been his final start with the White Sox, Pizarro struck out 10 batters in 7 2/3 innings to record his first win of the season. The White Sox decided not to trade Pizarro, and instead Daley was traded to the Yankees for Johnson and Art Ditmar. 
 
* One advantage of all the Kansas City-New York trades was Johnson and Ditmar knew a lot of former Yankees when they were traded to the A's in 1961: Hank Bauer, Andy Carey, Clint Courtney, Don Larsen, Jerry Lumpe, Mickey McDermott, Norm Siebern, and Marv Throneberry! 
 
* Johnson wore \#43 during his September cup of coffee with the Yankees in 1960. Making the Opening Day roster the following season, the Yankees issued him \#6. In those days especially, it was always a good sign if they gave you a low number. \#6 was last worn by Tony Fernandez (1995) before it was given to Joe Torre; it was retired for Torre on August 23, 2014. It was worn by Tony Lazzeri (1929-1937), Joe Gordon (1938-1946), Roy White (1969-1979), and Steve Sax (1989-1991). Mickey Mantle wore it when he first came up in 1951, [making for some odd photos](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Du6HAiqXcAEUy65.jpg). The 19-year-old Mick was sent back to the minors on July 13, and Bobby Brown -- who had worn \#6 since 1947, but had switched to \#9 -- reclaimed the number. When Mantle came back up at the end of August, he was given his iconic \#7. 
 
* Johnson would stick with \#6 on the Kansas City A's, then wear \#11 with the Reds, Braves, and Phillies. When he went to the now Oakland A's in 1973, he switched to \#7. With the Brewers he wore \#3, with the Red Sox \#30, with the White Sox \#12, and finally, \#15 when he returned to Boston for his final season. 
 
* In 1979, Johnson was inducted into the San Diego Sports Association's [Breitbard Hall of Fame](https://sandiegosportsassociation.com/project/breitbard-hall-of-fame-2/); the other Yankees there are Don Larsen, Graig Nettles, and Dave Winfield. 
 
* Johnson and Nettles are both graduates of San Diego High School, as were TV host Art Linkletter, movie star Gregory Peck, U.S. Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera, College Hall of Fame quarterback Cotton Warburton, and Olympic gold medal diver Bud Pinkston. 
 
* Johnson missed time to serve in the U.S. Army Reserve during the 1958, 1959, and 1962 seasons. 
 
* Johnson owned a ranch and was a real-life cowboy. [Just like in *Blazing Saddles*](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KMEdvlSCgQA/V8cSQMKmQ8I/AAAAAAAAZJY/Uy4KEow40147uElF6bjk59CXBmRw67AJwCLcB/s400/giphy.gif), he once punched a horse. ‚ÄúOne day he came to the park with a black eye and bruises all over his body,‚Äù Angels GM Buzzie Bavasi recalled. ‚ÄúSaid he had been kicked by one of the horses he used to raise.

1m27dwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m27dwd/find_out_if_the_mr_coffee_5cup_coffee_maker_lives/,Find Out If the Mr. Coffee 5-Cup Coffee Maker Lives Up to the Hype!,"**Compact Design Perfect for Small Spaces**  
I‚Äôve been using the Mr. Coffee 2129512 5-Cup Mini Brew Coffee Maker for a few weeks now, and right off the bat, the compact design has been a game changer for my small kitchen. It fits neatly on my countertop without crowding the space, which is a big deal when you‚Äôre working with limited room. Measuring just 10.7"" by 9.8"" by 7.2"", it‚Äôs easy to imagine it tucked into the corner of an apartment kitchen, dorm room, or even an RV setup. The simplistic black finish compliments most decors without being too flashy. I honestly didn‚Äôt expect a coffee maker of this size to function so effectively. 

**Intuitive Features That Simplify Your Morning**  
This little machine has a few tricks up its sleeve, and I‚Äôve come to appreciate its Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause feature. Imagine waking up just a little too impatient to wait for the entire brew cycle ‚Äì grab your cup mid-brew, and the coffee stops pouring until you set the carafe back down. For someone like me who values those first sips of coffee to jumpstart the day, it‚Äôs a thoughtful touch that makes all the difference. Pair that with its easy-to-view water window, and guessing water levels is officially a problem of the past. These little things make my mornings smoother without reinventing the wheel.  

[Time to see Mr. Coffee 2129512 cost on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08qd33pz2/)  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Operating this coffee maker is as simple as it gets ‚Äì one ON/OFF button and you're good to go. It‚Äôs a fully automatic drip coffee machine, which means it does all the heavy lifting while you focus on your toast or morning news. Cleaning, often the Achilles‚Äô heel of coffee makers, is refreshingly straightforward. The lift-and-clean filter basket makes cleanup less of a chore, even after multiple uses. I‚Äôve had experiences with fiddly setups in the past with coffee makers, but this one is blissfully user-friendly. 

**Capacity Suited for Two Cups**  
The 5-cup label might catch you off guard if you‚Äôre expecting a large brew. At 25 ounces, it‚Äôs designed for two 12-ounce cups of coffee, which I found perfect for a solo drinker or a pair of caffeine enthusiasts. My spouse and I can both enjoy our morning coffee without needing to make a second brew. Though the petite size might frustrate someone hosting guests, it‚Äôs a sweet spot for those of us living solo or sharing space with a partner.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact size ideal for tight spaces.  
- Grab-a-Cup Auto Pause function is incredibly convenient.  
- Straightforward operation and easy cleanup.  
- Ergonomic carafe with ounce markings for precision.  

**Flavor and Brewing Performance**  
I was a bit skeptical about flavor quality, given its no-frills appearance. After daily brewing across various coffee brands and grind levels, I can attest that it delivers a smooth, consistent flavor profile every single time. It might lack advanced brewing settings, but it makes up for that by simply being reliable. The hot plate keeps the coffee at the right temperature, though I wouldn‚Äôt leave it sitting for hours ‚Äì the taste does dull slightly over time as with all drip systems.  

**Caveats**  
- Limited capacity; not ideal for larger households or parties.  
- No programmable timer; manual setup required every time.  
- Glass carafe, while lightweight, feels fragile.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
When considering something like this coffee maker, it‚Äôs natural to compare it to others in the same price range. Brands like Black+Decker and Hamilton Beach offer similar 5-cup models. However, what sets this apart for me is its straightforward design and the Grab-a-Cup feature. Black+Decker models tend to have bulkier footprints, which wouldn‚Äôt have suited my counter, while Hamilton Beach options sometimes stretch into pricier areas despite offering similar features. For coffee enthusiasts looking for more advanced functionality, though, a programmable model might suit your needs better, even if it comes at a slightly higher cost.

**True Value**  
In terms of value for the quality it offers, I‚Äôd give this coffee maker a thumbs-up. It‚Äôs reasonably priced for what it delivers: compact size, practicality, and solid performance. Sure, it‚Äôs not the most feature-packed machine out there, but for a small household, it doesn‚Äôt need to be. The price-to-quality ratio makes this one of the best options if you‚Äôre seeking simplicity without sacrificing your caffeine fix.

1m27d2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1m27d2i/should_the_best_electric_kettle_be_the_chantal/,Should the best electric kettle be the Chantal Mia for pour-over fans?,"Testing the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle ELSL37-03M RE for the past few weeks has been an interesting experience. With its vibrant red finish and compact design, it quickly added a pop of color to my countertop. This electric kettle does not just look impressive‚Äîit backs up its aesthetic appeal with a host of thoughtful features catering to the needs of tea and coffee lovers alike. While I mostly found it satisfying, there are some points worthy of consideration.

**Eye-Catching Design and Build**  
The first thing anyone notices about this electric kettle is its striking design. The painted red finish gives it a sleek and modern vibe, while its petite build (9‚Äù x 9‚Äù x 9‚Äù dimensions) makes it ideal for smaller kitchens. The stainless steel interior was a major selling point for me, as I wanted to avoid kettles with plastic interiors. Its handle and spout are designed for precision, which I found helpful while attempting manual pour-over coffee. Even the 32 oz capacity felt just right for someone like me who‚Äôs brewing for one or two people. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the unit feels sturdy but isn‚Äôt overly heavy at 2.1 pounds, which makes it easy to handle without strain.  

[Grab Chantal Mia Electric Kettle ELSL37-03M RE at the best price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0cl5h9sr9/)  

**Performance You Can Rely On**  
In terms of functionality, this kettle holds its own. The ""slow pour spout"" is a standout feature that ensures water flows at a controlled rate, cooling it to approximately 205¬∞F as it pours‚Äîa sweet spot for brewing coffee. On trying this, I appreciated how much easier it made perfecting my pour-over technique. Beyond coffee-making, it‚Äôs equally amazing for everyday tea brewing. The auto shut-off and boil-dry protection saved me on more than one occasion when I got distracted, so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a thoughtful feature for busy users like me. It heats up quickly and consistently, though it‚Äôs not whisper-quiet during operation.  

**Advantages**  
The positives catch the eye pretty quickly:  
- Stylish red design adds a modern touch to any kitchen  
- Stainless steel interior avoids any plastic contact with water  
- Slow pour spout perfect for controlled coffee brewing  
- Auto shut-off and boil-dry protection improve safety  
- Compact and lightweight, ideal for smaller spaces  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
While it's a great product, some elements could use improvement:  
- Lack of variable temperature controls‚Äîsomething I‚Äôd appreciate for specialty teas  
- No clear window or indicator for water measurement when filling  
- Slightly noisier than some of its competitors  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Lugging around heavy kettles is never fun, and that‚Äôs where this lightweight model shines. Pouring felt smooth and comfortable thanks to its well-designed handle. However, I did miss having a water level window‚ÄîI had to lift the lid to check how much water I‚Äôd poured in, which could be slightly inconvenient. Cleaning was easy since it‚Äôs hand-wash only, but given that the interior is all stainless steel, it didn‚Äôt require much scrubbing. Be prepared to descale it occasionally, particularly if you live in an area with hard water.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing it to other electric kettles, such as those from Breville or OXO, the main distinction is the Mia‚Äôs spout, which is more precise for pour-over brewing. Breville‚Äôs kettles often come with variable temperature settings, a feature missing on this model. OXO electric kettles are known for their super-quiet operation and larger capacities, which might appeal more to families or frequent entertainers. However, the Chantal kettle's style and focused functionality make it hard to beat for single users or pour-over perfectionists.  

**True Value**  
In terms of value for money, this kettle justifies its price with its mix of design and functionality. While it‚Äôs not packed with high-tech features, it focuses on doing one thing well: providing coffee and tea lovers with a precision tool. If you value a robust build and stylish look over bells and whistles, this is worth considering.

I want to share my experience and clear up some common confusion about using non-Keurig pods in these popular coffee makers.

The short answer is yes - you can use non-Keurig brand pods in most Keurig machines. However, there are some important things to know before you start experimenting with different brands.

First, let's talk about K-Cup compatibility. Most Keurig machines made after 2014 work with any K-Cup pod, whether it's made by Keurig or not. I've personally used pods from brands like Eight O'Clock, San Francisco Bay, and Cameron's with no issues in my Keurig machine.

If you're shopping for a new Keurig coffee maker, you can check out the latest models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Some key points about pod compatibility:

1. Look for ""K-Cup compatible"" on the pod packaging
2. Avoid very cheap knockoff pods that might damage your machine
3. Newer Keurig 2.0 machines have special sensors but can be easily modified
4. Reusable pods work great for using your own ground coffee

I've found that using non-Keurig pods can save quite a bit of money without sacrificing quality. Store brands like Great Value and Amazon Basics make perfectly good K-Cup compatible pods that cost much less than official Keurig ones.

For the best brewing experience, I recommend:
- Cleaning your machine regularly
- Using filtered water
- Storing pods in a cool, dry place
- Running a water-only cycle between different coffee types

If you're interested in exploring different Keurig models that work with various pod brands, check out their current lineup: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

My personal experience with using non-Keurig pods has been overwhelmingly positive. The key is choosing quality pods from reputable manufacturers. I've saved hundreds of dollars over the years by mixing Keurig and non-Keurig pods while still enjoying great coffee every morning.

Remember that proper maintenance is crucial regardless of which pods you use. Keep your machine clean, descale regularly, and you'll have no problems using any compatible K-Cup pod.",1,1752758398.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

Self-care has become a priority, and I‚Äôm actually reading again‚Äîfinished five books just in July! The only thing I haven‚Äôt cut out completely is coffee but I‚Äôm feeling great overall.

I joined a gym, and I love it! It gives me such a natural high, and I‚Äôve been going every single day, sometimes even twice. I walk 2 miles every morning and night, and my anxiety is pretty much gone! It feels like a night and day difference. My doctor even noticed how much I‚Äôve improved since May.

I remember feeling bloated, swollen, and just unhappy a few months ago. Wine was a regular part of my evenings, and I was constantly fatigued. Now, I can see the progress in my photos and clothes, and it‚Äôs incredible how much better I feel in such a short time. Cutting out alcohol has been a huge factor in my mental health.

This journey isn't just for me‚Äîit's for my kids too. I want to break the cycle of unhealthy living and show them the importance of taking care of yourself. I feel stronger every day, both mentally and physically. A year ago, if you‚Äôd told me I‚Äôd be waking up at 4:30 AM to work out, I would have laughed! I‚Äôd probably would still be drunk passed out somewhere at that point. But now, it‚Äôs my routine, and I can‚Äôt imagine my day without it. Alcohol just does not fit into my current lifestyle. It‚Äôs amazing how much time I used to spend drinking, or thinking about drinking. What a waste. I don‚Äôt have time for that anymore. Nor, do I want to. I have 0 desire to even taste it anymore. The first few weeks of sobriety are for sure the hardest, with day 3-5 probably being the peak of forgetting how awful you felt and saying ‚Äúehh I‚Äôll just have a few tonight and start again tomorrow‚Äù DONT DO IT. It‚Äôs hard but push through. I did, and I‚Äôm so freaking proud of myself. This is the longest I‚Äôve gone since 2019 (other than being pregnant) and I have 0 desire to backtrack. If you‚Äôre just starting your sobriety journey - It gets better, trust me. So much better. 

I‚Äôve also almost eliminated my insomnia and am getting amazing sleep. My morning routine of walking/jogging while watching the sunrise and meditating has become my favorite time of day. I start each morning with gratitude and positivity, and I only regret not starting this journey sooner.

It‚Äôs healing to finally take care of myself after treating my body poorly for so long. I‚Äôve neglected both my physical and mental health, but getting the help I needed for my anxiety and ADHD has lifted a weight off my shoulders. Which brings me to say, if you need medical help to detox- DO NOT BE ASHAMED. You are not alone. Your journey is yours and not to be compared to anyone else‚Äôs. Even if you need to go somewhere to detox bc your anxiety is awful, and you aren‚Äôt having any physical symptoms, do it. Just do it. Seriously, it‚Äôs okay, and trust me, wherever you are going has seen way worse cases. There‚Äôs such a stigma around mental health and medication, but if I had a physical condition like diabetes, I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to seek treatment for insulin? 

If you‚Äôre struggling with similar issues, I encourage you to take that first step. You‚Äôre not alone, and there‚Äôs so much support out there. Especially here in this Reddit threat. I am seriously so grateful for everyone on here being so candid and sharing their stories. If it wasn‚Äôt for the support I‚Äôve had here I may not be where I am today. Welp if you‚Äôve made it this far I really appreciate you taking the time to read this. Remember, you‚Äôre not alone and we are all here rooting you on, ask if you need help, or if you just wanna chat reach out, we are in this together. üí™üèªHere‚Äôs to continuing this journey and feeling amazing every day!

Me and my fiancee have been together 5 years and engaged for 6 months, and despite this post we have a solid, trusting relationship and are both extremely open with each other about our whereabouts so that we know each other are safe when we are not together but the key thing we agreed on from the start is that our phones are off limits to each other in the sense that we were going to build a relationship on trust and for 5 years its all been perfect.

After a CBT session due a an old work issue i remember one key thing I was told and that was that if you see something its real and dont let anyone tell you otherwise‚Ä¶ sorry for the longwinded start , on to my issue.

I had a day off work to spend time with my friend and have a wholesome day together. So i woke up at 8:30 to get a shower before i set off and noticed my partner was still there. Now my fiancee is absolutely meticulous when it comes her schedule (work or home) she has condensed hours so starts at 7am and finishes at 6pm but she was still laid the flat out asleep, despite working from home that day she was due to be on at 7am, she got up roughly at the time i did with no urgency or worry about been late.

When i left she does text me and i do her during the day but she text me me nearly all day and managed to blow up and fill a pool, which means she was not actively working. Now 100 times out of 100 she does NOT leave her room other than for a drink or toilet break. When i came home she was ‚Äúworking‚Äù downstairs (thats fine we both do tht from time to time, for a change of scenary) but she made a point that she was working on something (unlike her) but closed the laptop at 4pm and never went back on,I found this unsual.

Later that evening, she was on her mobile and to my knowledge it wa doomscrolling tiktok or whatever i didn‚Äôt look at her screen, due to how i feel about privacy. However she jolted when i moved across the sofa, i thought nothing of tit but i moved on purpose 2‚Äì3 times more and she swiped her screen off whatever she was doing, again i took care in not looking at the contents or reading anything. I find this behavior incredible suspect and secretive. I actually called her out on it immediately and she said ‚ÄúI had finished texting‚Äù About 2 days later she explained that it was work related and didnt want to take up our time with it, which IS something we have spoke about, her work overlapping or taking over time.

The key component to this siuation is as follows. Through a mutal friend i KNOW she had a meeting with a friend for a coffee. This mutal friend, didnt drop this information to hurt or harm anyone but to check if i was going too because he have very similar interests and hobbies. I just said no i wasnt invited and that was that. Now to CLEAR i dont care that she is meeting someone else, Im not entirely bothered didnt tell me about the plan she had to meetup with someone. Im upset that i asked her did she have the day off (i think she lied, im also upset that she lied/neglected to tell me what she was going to do that day, i hope that makes sence.

I have since found out through that mutual friend that she didnt actually go and meet them and cancelled on them. However she told the person she was meeting that the reason she cancelled was because of ME, specifically because ‚Äúi didnt believe it was just for a coffee‚Äù & ‚Äúto keep the peace between us both‚Äù. Now bare in mind i found this out days after this had all happened, i DIDN‚Äôt know she had the time off or was meeting anyone. So not only am i upset she didnt tell me after I asked what she had done today but she decided to ‚Äúthrow me under the bus‚Äù to someone and lie and blame me for the reasons hse couldnt go in such a fashion in makes me look like a paranoid person, which im not (I guess you have to take me word for that, because im here posthing this message)

I must say i dont believe in my heart of hearts she is cheating, i stress this purely about the lack of openess and honest.

I have spoken to her about it since:  
\- She said that the phone swiping thing was work related text and didnt want to take up our time with it, which IS something we have spoke about, her work overlapping or taking over time.  
\- I even went as far as saying i feel like she is cheating (despitenot orginally feeling like that) but im not sure if i think that, want to believe that or just have had too much time to overthink it.  
\- she was given the opportnuity to tell me what she did on that day or was planning to do that day, but she ha neglected to tell me and has stuck to the fact she was working.

Please be brutal, am i going mad? or is she acting a bit strangely?  
p.s apologies for any spelling or grammar mistakes.

I'm not generalizing at all, but this has happened to me a couple of times

and I have started to develop a bias.



So met this girl from Butwal through a mutual friend, we already had talked for 6,7 months on and off before we finally decided to meet as she was in Kathmandu for some work. I took her to a place for coffee, she was utterly excited about the venue, it was  a nice place with a view. Her excitement wasn't a bad a thing at all, i'd say it was cute even. 



My first amusement was when she lowkey snapped at the waiter for leaving the water bottle as it is, she said ""ettikai rakhdera kasari khane, glass ma haldinu ni"". It came off so rude, i tried to ease the moment saying ""haha thikai cha, ma rakhchu ni"" but I felt so bad for the guy. The whole date, she told me about the clubs she has been to and the ones she hasn't and about the guys who text her asking to meet. And after every 2,3 sentences she'd mention that I am so lucky to be from Kathmandu and how her hometown has only one bhatbhateni which is the only place people go if ghumna jana man lagyo vane. 

Afterwards, she'd show me the clothes she bought, saying yo club ma jana yo lagaune, and she'd ask how far Nagarkot or Kakani is, where exactly is LOD located  and if I have been to these places. If i'd say yes, she'd repeat the Kathmandu born wala thing again.



After the food came my biggest amusement of all. This girl didn't leave one balcony or one corner of the restautant to take photos at. Taking photos is not a big deal but I reckon I took around 300 photos of her, to a point that everyone in the place was looking at at us. I repeated more than 10 times, 'feri aaumla ni ani khicha na tanna' but she made me take her photos at every angle, the weirdest one was at top of food table with her legs crossed. 



Then comes the bill part, I don't mind paying for the first date but the least could do her is be there and not haste to the washroom when i asked for the bill. This is not a deal-breaker at all but I thought i'd mention it. While returning, she asked me if I could take her Thamel ko route bata, which I did and yeah, again the clubbing talks. 



TLDR: met with a girl from tier2,3 city, all she has is  fascination for 'Kathmanndu ko Keta haru', clubbing and shopping. ",7,1752757731.0,NepalSocial,42,0.82,False

1m273ed,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m273ed/theres_something_wrong_with_the_soft_play_centre/,There‚Äôs Something Wrong with the Soft Play Centre:,"When my Manager offered me extra shifts last week, I said yes without hesitation. I don‚Äôt do much in the evenings, and I could use the extra cash. 

‚ÄúGet Nadia to show you around the play centre before you leave today,‚Äù said Craig.

Nadia‚Äôs my coworker. The soft play centre is her patch. Most jobs at the Leisure centre take two, maybe three hours at most, but Nadia rarely got away before ten each night. 

My tongue was already in knots. ‚ÄúSorry‚Äìwould it be ok if I got here for, like, 5pm?‚Äù

He gave a smiling nod. ‚ÄúNadia doesn‚Äôt usually start the clean ‚Äòtil six.‚Äù

I thanked him again. Good manners make up for all the times I‚Äôd taken his instructions too literally. Craig‚Äôs much more tolerant than other bosses. His slow, plodding steps and thick Blackpool accent made it hard to feel afraid of him.

‚ÄúSee how you like it,‚Äù  he fell in step beside me as I continued down the corridor to find my colleague. I thought he was making a joke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably a bit old for soft play.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúNo, I meant the cleaning shift.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Äìof course.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very different job from cleaning the gym. But if you like it, you could maybe take these hours on for good.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs Nadia leaving?‚Äù 

Craig gave a slow shrug. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs off on holiday this week‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll see what happens after that. Thanks, sweetheart.‚Äù

 I like Nadia. We don‚Äôt know each other well, but she has the kindest smile and never looks irritated when I ask for help. What‚Äôs more, she looks like Mary from Silent Hill (!) 
Eventually, I found her in the cleaning cupboard, twirling her earphones around her finger. 

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù 

At the sound of my voice, she let out a stifled gasp. 

I smiled an apology. ‚ÄúI should have knocked.‚Äù


She stared at me, wide-eyed, for a second or so. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she laid her hand on my arm. ‚ÄúSorry, honey, sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúN-no worries. Um‚ÄìCraig says you‚Äôre off tomorrow?‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm c-covering your shifts this week,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äú...just wondered if you had a second to show me how you clean the soft play sometime this morning?‚Äù

Nadia looked at me in silence for a minute. It made me feel awkward. Had I offended her? ‚ÄúCraig asked you to cover me?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I smiled. Her eyes grew wider. I felt myself wilt. I guessed she thought I wasn‚Äôt competent (but was too nice to admit it.)

‚ÄúUh-huh.‚Äù She shook her head and stuck her phone back in her pocket, leaving the earphones trailing. Ushering me out, she smiled hard. ‚ÄúI start upstairs.‚Äù

The experience of that first walk-around was nostalgic. The faded walls, the gaudy illustrations of cartoon animals, and the playful shadows cast by snaking slides and sprawling ball pits were precisely as I remembered them. The sickly smell of birthday cake and vomit inspired in me a wave of memories. As we plodded round the parent‚Äôs cafe, I could almost see Mum sipping tea at the corner table, like some disconsolate prisoner. I felt my brother‚Äôs spirit running to the rope swing that dangled barely half a foot from the cushioned floor. Even the squeak of Nadia‚Äôs trainers against the spongy green floor was tinged with childhood. I remembered every lonely moment, playing alone on the slides while the other kids giggled behind me. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mop every day,‚Äù Nadia‚Äôs voice brought me back from reverie. 

‚ÄúOh. That‚Äôs good.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly once or twice a week. Or when someone‚Äôs spilled juice.‚Äù

I was glad to hear it. At the back of the soft play, the dimly lit corridors wound left and right without any discernible pattern. We passed a solitary waste bin. Shaped like an anthropomorphic beetle, its sordid smile betrayed ten years‚Äô grime. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶change the bins too, right?‚Äù I asked when the silence had lasted too long between us.

‚ÄúIf you want,‚Äù Nadia turned to me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not technically meant to start clean-down until 6pm. But I try and sneak in here at 5. That way, I‚Äôm not here after dark.‚Äù

‚ÄúI imagine it‚Äôs a bit spooky‚Äì‚Äù

I meant it as a joke, but Nadia took me seriously. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to stay the whole three hours.‚Äù

Her heavy tone caught me off guard. But as I studied her face, I saw her features bore a strange, almost protective quality. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hang around if you don‚Äôt need to. You‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt take a whole three hours, this job. And if you feel weird about being here alone, just lock up and get out. Ok?‚Äù

I was touched. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

She held my gaze. She wanted me to say something more, but I couldn‚Äôt think of anything that wouldn‚Äôt sound contrived. ‚ÄúStill,‚Äù she added at last. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt put yourself at risk. It‚Äôs not worth it.‚Äù

My first shift was that night. I got to the sports centre just before 5 and got a redbull from the vending machine. Before I went any further, I pulled my earphones carefully over my head. The long, strip-lit corridor has that hard, vinyl flooring that makes footsteps offensively loud. I pattered past the disused lockers and the old squash courts until I reached the door emblazoned:

TunnelWig Play Centre

I swiped my card and opened the door. As it was nearly closing, a handful of kids were visible through the rope mesh that separated the play centre from the parents‚Äô cafe. A tired-looking young woman called her child from one of the tables as the supervisor appeared behind the counter. She was tall and blonde, maybe 28, or 29 years old, and very pretty. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she flashed me a sunny smile. 

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I mumbled. ‚ÄúAm‚Ä¶I too early to get started?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Nadia?‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs on holiday.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Äìyou‚Äôre covering?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù the sound of my voice was egregious to me. 

She nodded over to the cafe. ‚ÄúWould you mind getting started over there, please? Someone‚Äôs just wee-weed on the floor.‚Äù

My attraction to her died that instant. I filled my bucket full of lemon soap and hot water, before dragging it over to the pool of ‚Äúwee-wee‚Äù (!) I finished up the floor and got started in the cafe; sweeping crumbs off tables, wiping down chairs, before running the shitty Henry-Hoover over the sticky floor. 

It was nearly half eight when I got done, and all the staff had left. I sighed. I was so tired, and the constant smell of nappies grated on my senses. Waiting for me upstairs was the wreckage of a birthday party. Garish cellophane and disheveled party hats were strewn over the floor. I crouched down and crawled inside the jungle gym itself. Cake crumbs and sticky fingerprints were smeared across the interlocking foam flooring and walls. I cleared as much as I could, before shuffling back out of the cramped tunnel to empty the pan. 

It takes a lot to gross me out these days. What I noticed in the pan didn‚Äôt gross me out as such, but gave me pause. Amidst the party crumbs was a single strand of human hair. There‚Äôs nothing abnormal in that; kids pull each other‚Äôs hair out all the time. The weird thing is that this hair was silver. 

Wrinkling my nose, I lowered the dustpan into the cafe bin. Someone‚Äôs grandma must have followed their grandchild into the squishy tunnel and got stuck. Maybe they had smuggled in some red wine to pass the time, while their infant threw themselves at other kids and into ball pits for hours. It must have been a very small old lady who could fit in there. 

Once the crumbs were clear, I shuffled back into of the tunnel. It wasn‚Äôt easy; even at five foot five, I was too long for the environment and ended up back-crawling out of the warren like a fat badger. The soft play cushions were warm, but it was freezing in the cafe area. I pulled my jacket closer over my uniform. If the janitors had turned the central heating off, I was probably the only person left onsite. I never thought I cared about working late, but the idea of the empty swimming pools and miles of deserted corridors gave me a creepy feeling. I‚Äôd never been at the leisure centre this late before. Maybe that‚Äôs why my soul left my body when I caught sight of a leering face out of the corner of my eyes. 

It was, of course, only the beetle bin; its plastic mouth incapable of anything more than a shit-eating grin. Laughing, I sauntered over to it and produced another cloth from my pocket. I sprayed the synthetic cheek with blue window cleaning fluid and scrubbed coffee spots off the white cast teeth. 

‚ÄúWhy would they put this here?‚Äù Don‚Äôt get me wrong; the hideous creature was probably charming when it was new. In its present state, only Russ McKamey would choose it as furniture. Its smile‚Äôs sleazy effect was not helped by the slogan slapped on the wall above in yellow bubble-writing: Can you find the tunnel Wig?

I fucking hope not. I finished polishing the bin, and reached to unscrew its grey head. I carefully held my breath as I ducked close to its mouth to prevent the damp, rotten smell of the rubbish from invading my senses. It did not. 

I jumped back from the beetle-bin. Its many limbs were fixed in a perpetual shrug. When you clean for a living, you get used to freaky stenches, but this smell was different. Think sickly-sweet birthday cake frosting mixed with banana peels and those button mushrooms that languish at the bottom of the vegetable draw. Think mold furring on apples or a Halloween pumpkin left out in the rain until January. 

What the hell were they putting in there? I peered at the bin with renewed caution. It probably hadn‚Äôt been changed in months. I double-gloved my hands and craned my neck back as I reached forward to unscrew the beetle‚Äôs head carefully. Had someone brought their hamster in, only for it to escape and die at the bottom of the barrel? It smelled too sweet to be a carcass, but I reconsidered as I inched closer and closer to the beetle-bin. Sweaty hands closed around suppurating peaches. A stomach distended from a manic binge. The devil‚Äôs smoothie. It made my head swim as I placed my hands on the Beetle‚Äôs smiling cheeks and slowly unscrewed the top. 

The black plastic rustled, and a waft of death assaulted my senses. I turned my nose away, pressed my lips together, and coiled the bin bag closed around my finger. Slowly, I lifted it, only to find that the liner was stuck to the bin‚Äôs bottom. Whatever was making the unholy smell had leaked through the plastic and solidified. 

‚ÄúOh God,‚Äù I gingerly shook the bin to loosen it, to no avail. No wonder Nadia never changes it, I thought they should just chuck this in a skip. It was too far behind the cafe area to get proper use anyway, yet I could not (in good conscience) neglect my duties by leaving the spoiled bag in situ. Kids use this space. Whatever was in the bag, it wasn‚Äôt safe. Besides, I didn‚Äôt want Nadia to think I had half-arsed it (or Craig, for that matter.)

‚ÄúCome on, come on,‚Äù I whispered, half to the beetle and half to myself. That was when I felt it: a sharp, piercing stinging on the back of my clenched palm. It was acute, like a dog bite, but as I pulled my hand away with a cry, it oozed until my whole hand throbbed.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?!‚Äù I staggered back, pressing hard on my hand which shrieked in pain. I lifted my fingers briefly to see if my skin was broken. I turned my hand over, then again, looking for a welt or a cut. Not only was there no blood‚Äìbut there was no mark to be seen. Worse still was the feeling that succeeded; a cold, prickly realization, like sweat breaking on my brow, that I was not alone. 

My nerve broke like a twig beneath my feet. I kicked the hoover back into the cleaning cupboard, grabbed my cleaning caddy and hared out of there. I thundered down the stairs and back into the reception bay before jamming the key code in and throwing back the door. I didn‚Äôt stop running until I got to the cloakroom. As I pulled my bag over my shoulder, I realized how absurd the whole thing was. I stood there, panting and checking my hand over again. Nothing. 

I sighed and trudged back to reception to clock out. I scribbled something down in the incident book. If there was some kind of biting bug infestation in the beetle bin, there was no way the play centre was fit for public use. Perhaps the closing mechanism on the lid was rusted, and my hand had caught on the hinge. That explained it. The stench‚Ä¶well, that would be gone as soon as the janitor team saw my note in the maintenance book. They‚Äôd just cart the bin off and hurl it in the landfill where it belonged. As for the creepy feeling? That was me, I thought, just being a scared-y little bitch. 

These explanations are so rational that I can almost believe them. Does anyone know what might be in that beetle bin that stinks so horribly? Ideally, I don‚Äôt want to hear suggestions about severed limbs or dead kids. I‚Äôd feel much better if I knew what to tell the janitors so they take it away ASAP. If anyone‚Äôs come across anything like this before, please let me know. 

On Friday evening, I arrived a little early and headed to reception. ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I swallowed, ‚Äúuh‚ÄìI was cleaning the soft play last night, and one of the bins smelled really bad‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off as the receptionist‚Äôs disdainful look dried me up. ‚ÄúCould you please ask one of the janitors to take a look for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you change the binbag?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI tried, but whatever‚Äôs in there has leaked and it‚Äôs stuck to the bottom.‚Äù

With a long sigh, she picked up a pen and scrawled a note into the janitor‚Äôs book. I thanked her and made my way to the Soft Play. I stuck a podcast in my ears. Maybe a touch of brain rot would distract me from the crawling melancholy that came over me the night before. 

Pushing open the door, I was hit by a wave of freezing air. Why did they keep it so cold? I pulled my jacket over my shoulders and set to work. Time passed quicker than the night before; I knew the job better, and there was less mess, it being a weekday night. As a kid, I usually came to the soft play on weekdays after Mum pulled me out of school. There were two reasons for this: one, it was quieter (which reduces my public meltdowns) and two, it meant I could enjoy the play centre after I stopped getting invited to other kids‚Äô birthday parties. 

As I leaned over to plunge my mop into the bucket, a memory slammed into my head like a truck. I had been to a party here once. The birthday boy, Jay, was turning six. The whole class was invited, so he couldn‚Äôt leave me out. I spent the entire time playing in the ball pit. 

A series of images danced before my eyes: red, green, and yellow plastic balls rising up around me; a cluster of my classmates giggling through the mesh, looking over at me here and there; the stench; crying, in Mum‚Äôs arms; driving home before they cut the cake. 

That was when the smell came back. It was as eye-watering as when I‚Äôd stood over the open bin, though now, I stood meters away. I covered my nose. No matter where I went, the smell persisted; a noxious ghost at every corner of the room. I persevered, holding my breath, but it soon overpowered me. The sticky, sickly, sweet rot was all I could perceive. I was forced to stagger upstairs to escape. There, it was a fraction better. The closer I got to the soft play‚Äôs entrance, the fainter it became. 

I checked my phone. It was only fifteen minutes to my shift‚Äôs end. Reaching behind me, I pulled my feather duster from the caddy, knelt down, and crawled into the tunnel. My knees were comfortable against the cushioned floor, and the smell melted away. I had not realized how much my bones were aching until I let myself rest. I work two jobs and get up at 4 am to get to my first shift. Adding overtime to that was pushing my stamina. But what choice did I have? I tend to annoy bosses and colleagues just as much as I angered my friends at school. It‚Äôs just how I am. That‚Äôs why I got into cleaning. It‚Äôs long hours, early starts, and late finishes‚Äìbut I can get on with my work, and others don‚Äôt have to deal with me. I don‚Äôt bother them, and they don‚Äôt bother me. 

You could never bother me. I opened my eyes. I hadn‚Äôt realized they were closed. At first, I thought the words came from a kindly internal voice‚Äìin my head, I mean. You know (I‚Äôm sure) how you‚Äôre internal monologue sounds? It wasn‚Äôt like that. It wasn‚Äôt my voice. It belonged to someone else. It sounded a little like my grandma but‚Ä¶ thinner. The vowels were more crisp, the tone mottled. It was long and soft, with many spindly arms gently waving and long, silvery hair. The soft play mat was warm beneath my cheek. 

I lifted my head quickly. What if there were cameras in here? If someone saw me knelt prayer-like with my head against the cushions, I‚Äôd get sacked or, at the very least, sent to a shrink. I stumbled to my feet and packed away my hoover and caddy, aware of a mysterious yet acute sense of mourning. 

The wifi is shit in the soft play, so Mum‚Äôs message didn‚Äôt ping on my phone until I reached the cloakroom. ‚ÄúHi love! I‚Äôm outside.‚Äù

Shit. I stuffed my keys into my pocket, grabbed my bag and ran back to reception. I clocked out as quickly as I could. Outside, I scanned the dark, rain-lashed car park for the tinny Mercedes C-class. I am far too old for rides home with family. That said, I hadn‚Äôt asked her to pick me up. She‚Äôd swung by anyway. 

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I opened the door and hopped inside. Mum grinned. ‚ÄúHow was work?‚Äù I asked. 

‚ÄúI need another job,‚Äù she answered. I laughed. ‚ÄúAs bad as that?‚Äù

She looked at me. Her long, dark hair was tied in a ponytail that now bore the first strands of silver. She was fifty, after all. Her face curled in concern as she flicked the indicator and turned her attention back to the road. ‚ÄúYou look tired, sweetheart.‚Äù 

I laughed and rubbed my eyes. ‚ÄúYeah, I am. I am ok, though.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI should never have taken you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said I should never have taken you to the soft play.‚Äù

I thought for a second. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be daft, Mama.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was too much for you,‚Äù she said, turning into our road. ‚ÄúLook‚Äìyou‚Äôre crying and exhausted. The other kids were mean again, weren‚Äôt they?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, they were. But it‚Äôs my fault,‚Äù I added, ‚ÄúI was being weird‚Ä¶I think I miss Grandma.‚Äù

‚ÄúAww,‚Äù Mum looked so sad. We drove on in silence for a minute or so. 

‚ÄúWait‚Äìno, Mama. The other kids weren‚Äôt there today.‚Äù

She frowned. ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a weeknight, remember?‚Äù 

Mum nodded. I looked back at the road, only to find myself parked on my drive. I stayed in the car a second, letting the tears fall of their own accord. Good Lord, I thought, I miss her so much. 

I got out of the car and got inside the house. I made some food, took it to my room, and watched some YouTube for a bit. Has anyone else had weird shit in their feed recently? My YouTube history consists entirely of ‚ÄòReal Housewives‚Äô clips and Marketplier. So tell me why there was a wildlife documentary at the top of my recommended videos?! 

I ended up watching it anyway. I love animals, and it was a pretty cool episode. I put my phone on charge and let David Attenborough‚Äôs dulcet tones serenade me with the lifecycle of Darkling Beetles:

‚ÄúFeed on decaying fruits‚Ä¶sweet decay‚Ä¶larvae‚Ä¶.pie dish beetle‚Ä¶thin, vellous silver hairs on their back‚Ä¶radiation‚Ä¶predation‚Ä¶.abomination‚Ä¶blasphemy‚Ä¶‚Äù

Satisfied that autoplay was on, I let myself drift further into reverie. 

‚Äú...eggs laid in willing hosts‚Ä¶wigs grow to full size in seconds‚Ä¶no less than you deserve‚Ä¶.may your carcass rot in unhallowed ground‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I was almost asleep when I felt something brush against my face. I turned my head. Another scuff; I opened my eyes. There, on my duvet, beside my hand which was half-curled in sleep, was a beetle. Its back shone like a jewel in the moonlight. With a yelp, I tried to flick it from the covers but it clung on. It was the same size as my phone. Its horns rose like TV aerials, at least five inches long. Its limbs spread akimbo, in a shrug. 

It was that manner of insect that makes you sick just by looking at it. I squealed and hurled my duvet off the bed to put some distance between myself and the freaky bug. 

It was a grave mistake. The creepy crawly had already done its work. As soon as the duvet hit the ground, the smell of putrefaction and birthday cake rose festered from my body. My skin was covered in round, suppurating holes where the wig‚Äôs eggs were laid and hatched. Hungry generations scuttled underneath my pajamas. I felt larvae crawling through my breasts. Winged legions flew in and out of the cracks of my arms, thighs, and abdomen as a thousand dot-like black beetles swelled bigger by the instant inside my mouth and scuttled down my throat. I thrashed to free myself. But I had more limbs, now, than I could control. The extra arms hung heavy at my sides as the hatchlings gnawed their way through my eardrums and clawed through my skull to taste the fatty brain meat within. I screamed in agony. 

Thankfully, my scream woke me up. Good thing I live alone. I hope the neighbors didn‚Äôt hear me. No one said anything over the weekend, so I am pretty hopeful that I did not disturb them. 

I‚Äôve had night terrors before. It‚Äôs usually just a sign that I am stressed, so I called in sick on Friday. I had the weekend off, and Monday‚Äôs my day off anyway. I spent time walking in the park, feeding the canada geese and reading ‚ÄòRebecca‚Äô on the bench. I was feeling a touch better until Craig texted me this morning. Nadia has not come back to work. 

Today was horrendous. I haven‚Äôt shaken off the nightmare; it feels as though something‚Äôs crawling in my brain. It‚Äôs not a physical feeling; more a long, thin shudder crawling in my imagination. I feel unwell. But rent is due in a week. 

The Leisure centre was busier than usual with fifty-somethings in lycra and sweatpants. Once I‚Äôd fought my way through this horror show to reception, I found the concierge absent from her desk. 

With a deep breath I made my way along the corridor to the soft play centre. Passing the office, I was surprised to see Craig hunched over his laptop and a dry sandwich. He is never usually on-site beyond 3 pm.  

I tried to walk by, but it was too late. I‚Äôd made eye contact. I sensed he wanted to be left in peace, but he smiled. ‚ÄúCallie! How ye‚Äô doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, fine, thanks, Craig. How come you‚Äôre here so late? N-not working too hard, I hope?‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúNah, just problem-solving.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry about Friday.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, no worries! You feeling better?‚Äù

‚ÄúA l-lot better, yeah.‚Äù

He narrowed his eyes. ‚ÄúCould have fooled me.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I demurred. ‚ÄúNah, I promise. I‚Äôm alright. I‚Äôm sorry to leave you short. I bet it was a pain in the bum trying to find cover.‚Äù

He shook his head. ‚ÄúNo trouble‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre ever feeling under the weather, I‚Äôd much rather you told me before it gets bad.‚Äù

His kind warning took me off guard. ‚ÄúI promise I won‚Äôt need any more sick days.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean that,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fine, Callie. I‚Äôd much rather you told me if something was wrong, that‚Äôs all‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt lose any more good staff.‚Äù

I was flattered, but his meaning wasn‚Äôt lost on me. ‚ÄúHas someone left?‚Äù

He heaved a heavy sigh. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt look like Nadia‚Äôs coming back.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike...ever?!‚Äù

Craig nodded. I was sad to hear it, though somehow, I wasn‚Äôt surprised. ‚ÄúI-is she ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs got a lot of stuff going on at home‚Ä¶it‚Äôs for the best. Bless ‚Äòer. Wexham Park rang this morning‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in hospital?!‚Äù I swallowed. I pictured the cheery, smiling Nadia curled up on a hospital bed, with the smell of iodine and nurse alarms beeping incessantly around her. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs between us. I know I don‚Äôt need to say that.‚Äù

I nodded hard. ‚ÄúBut the point stands,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúif these hours ever get too much for you‚Ä¶if this place ever gets under your skin‚Ä¶you‚Äôve got to tell me. Ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù It was under my skin already, yet I couldn‚Äôt burden Craig after he‚Äôd been so nice. 

I grabbed my cleaning caddy and skulked off to start work. As the staff had left, the play centre was eerily quiet as ever, and the floors were littered with popcorn following a movie party. I shoved my earphones in and swept the sticky denizens into a dustpan. The smell was on me like a hawk and only worsened as I tried to ignore it. I‚Äôd sprayed a cleaning cloth with Lavender room spray earlier that day. I produced it from my pocket and pressed it against my nose, like a plague doctor, terrified of bad airs. Barely an hour passed when it got too much, and I was forced upstairs. 

The tunnel ran through the jungle gym like the marshy veins that flowed through my hands. I knelt. My knees sunk into pillows, giving themselves to be held. I pressed my nose against the crash mat. I smelled as sickly sweet as the vomit I scratched from my throat when I was 17; the taste of a child‚Äôs birthday cake mingled with acidic bile. I shut my eyes. 

That was when I felt it. Beneath the vinyl carpet, something was stirring. The floor rose, just barely, like an infant‚Äôs chest rising and falling in sleep. What was‚Ä¶remembering myself, I pulled my head up from the floor. I pulled, and pulled harder. It was no good. My head was stuck to the floor. 

The insipid peace melted away and terror succeeded. I cried out, twisting my neck around and hunching my shoulders in a desperate attempt to free myself from the floor. I scratched, I clawed, I wrenched; a sinewy vine of pink foam stretched from the spot where I laid my head to my cheek. I reached for the sagging centre and clenched my fists around the mallow-y tendril, trying to tear it in two. It was warm to the touch and moist. In my hunted grip, I swear I felt its pulse radiating through my arms, beating in time with my heart. 

‚ÄúGet off me!‚Äù

I pulled, but the fleshy rope wouldn‚Äôt break. It only stretched as I pulled it thinner and thinner, like a taffy strip. When it was like strands of spaghetti, I scrambled to my feet. Turning to the padded walls, I scraped my palms against the climbing ropes. The squashy capillaries stuck fast to the rope but cloyed my hands. It would not relinquish me. 

‚ÄúGet off!‚Äù I burst into a scrambling, stumbling run down the foam-padded corridors. I was too big for them now; the nimble child I once was now lay underneath the interlocking foam mats, pressed between layers of the memories of sleeping children. At 25, I was an adult in a birth canal, ‚Äúcuckold, disinherited,‚Äù scrambling towards the slide and the gaping ball pit that was my only exit. 

I reached the top of the slide just as the floor beneath my feet turned warm with life. The smell of birthday cake flooded my senses, paired with children‚Äôs laughter. I hurled myself down the scarlet plastic slide, whirling towards destruction. The ball pit opened up, ready to swallow me whole. I screamed as a million multicolored balls swelled around me. I was an infection, a parasite, worthy only of a swift immune response. It‚Äôs all that I have ever been. Taking one last gasp of air, I turned my nose and mouth into the pit and hauled myself towards the exit. 

My eyes were wide with terror as I stared at what seemed like miles of ball pit beneath me. Popped party balloons, snacks wet with spittle, and used nappies populated its depths. Overpowered by the stench, I pursed my lips and held that final breath, even as it festered in my lungs because I could not smell whatever was down there. I strained to hold my breath, letting air out in tiny increments through my mouth to relieve the burning pressure in my chest. Something rumbled beneath my middle as I floated blindly through the plastic ocean. I floundered, in vain, to move myself closer to the exit that I had not had to use for nearly twenty years. Was it still there? Or had it moved? Even if the exit was the same as in 2007, would I fit through that tiny circle of light meant only for children? Besides, I could never fit all my arms and legs through the hole. I wriggled on my back, flailing my many limbs. Helpless, frightened tears poured down my face as I imagined the poor staff having to find me: my mandibles opening and closing as a supersonic screech poured out of me, my abdomen furred over with silver hairs like an old strawberry.

They shouldn‚Äôt have to see me. No-one should. I don‚Äôt want to bother anyone. 

I was an adult now. How was I still incapable of coordinating my monstrous body? Why did my legs and arms get by as dangling deadweights for so long? I have never hated myself so much as I did at the moment. Bitch! My voice was high and low all at once, composed of frequencies that most could not hear. Stupid fucking bitch! I hate you, I hate you, I FUCKING HATE YOU!

Fuelled by self-loathing, I pulled with all my might. A supersonic screech of effort burst from my mouth as I raised my armored head towards the gap. My front arms went first‚Äìthen another pair, my second, third‚Äìthen, my front legs, back legs, and all of my bloated, shivering, hairy abdomen until at last, like a fever,  I burst from the ball bit, trampling broken fragments of shell, spurred on by the sugary grease that coated the floor. Putrescine. Cadaverine. Sweet decay, my rotten home. 

The feeling of the cold, sticky floor beneath my cheek brought me to myself. I felt as though I were on fire with terror as I staggered to my feet and ran down the stairs to the cafe area and the blessed exit beyond. I knocked over my cleaning caddy, spilling acrid fluids on the floor as my trainers scraped the ground and my laces caught beneath. I hit the ground hard but staggered up as my heart pounded and my head reverberated with pain. I barely stopped to get my car keys and dashed my hip against the tables as I swerved to lift my bag and threw myself towards the corridor. Tears of fright blurred my vision as I jabbed the key code in beneath the gaudy bubble writing on the door: 

‚ÄúGood Job! You found the Tunnelwig.‚Äù

I was out of the door like a bat out of hell. The rickety lockers creaked as my footsteps sent earthquakes through the floor. ‚ÄúCallie?‚Äù I heard Craig‚Äôs voice, warm and anxious, behind me, but I did not stop. I did not even look behind me until I got to my car. I floored it home as phantom beetles scuttled over my throat and down the back of my neck. 

How cold and dark my bedroom was. I slept with the light on, but this domicile comfort did nothing for the smell. It was everywhere. It clung to my duvet and pillows and bled into the futile perfumes I sprayed all through the night to keep it at bay. I did not sleep, but pressed my nose into my Grandma‚Äôs old jersey. I kept my phone open to see the picture of Mum on my home screen. My beautiful mother; the only one who ever loved me. 

But that‚Äôs not true, is it? There is another that would love me profoundly if only I let it. My 6 am alarm went off, and I was so sick of the smell that I felt no options were left. I would have to return to the place where the stench can‚Äôt follow.

Tonight‚Äôs my last shift. I go gladly and feel no fear. Craig: I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be clocking in tomorrow morning. I am sorry to give such short notice. I know it‚Äôs inconvenient. To my Mum and Grandma, I love you so very much, and I am sorry. Please don‚Äôt worry about me, though. I am happy. I greet the rising mound of foam with joy. It will wrap around me with the ardor of a lover and with all the warmth of childhood. It cares not that I am what I am. It will not spit me out. I am with my brothers and sisters now, all of us pressed like layers of earth beneath the foamy floor. 

I don‚Äôt know what else to say. Knowing me, I have probably left something out. Sorry. Anyway, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got time to write. It‚Äôs getting on, and I‚Äôll be late for work.

Love this community and am hoping to lean on everyone here for a confidence boost and level setting. Here's the context: I have an \~ 7 y/o male Samoyed (neutered). It's just the two of us. He's my pride and joy. I've always intended to get a second Sammy because they're social need a playmate. For life reasons, I haven't been in the position to do that until now. Things in my life are finally chill and calm enough that I have the time and freedom to dedicate to a second pup.

That being said: it's been a long time since I did the puppy thing, and I was partnered when I did it the first time. But, doing this solo seems like it has it's pros: I won't have to negotiate how I want to train my pup and everything will be in my control. I have a training facility I've selected and would like to try my hand at agility (+ brushing up on training with my 7 y/o boy because, ya know, you learn a lot the first time around!).

Things about me: I work remotely, so I'm home most of the time, though I enjoy being on the go, e.g. hitting up coffee shops to work for a couple of hours, typical errand running, hiking. When it's cool enough, I take my pup with me where I can. My biggest concerns are 1) the emotional impact to my current pup, and 2) underestimating the potential for the ""puppy blues"" 3) how this will affect my freedom and mobility long term\*.  I am someone who thinks through things and I've been thinking about this for years. I currently HAVE things lined up to bring home my next pup in \~4 weeks, and am feeling some last minute, ""Um, am I sure sure?? Have I considered **everything**?""

I know this is quite long but my questions are: what was is like for you to add a second to your home? Has anyone done this solo? I worry about the impact to my freedom but I already have one pup, so I'm already accustomed to the consideration one makes when caring for another being.

Anyways, would really just love hear from you all. Is this a terrible idea to do alone? I think about my two pups playing together and having a ball and it just lights me up. I'm taking a week off work to put all my focus on training and integration the week I bring home my pup. Also, I'll be bringing home a male Sammy, and I'm a little worried due to things I've heard about that.

As I mentioned, I don't post often, so please don't roast me haha. I really just want to do what's best for my guy(s) and me. :)",2,1752757580.0,samoyeds,9,1.0,False

# How to Decorate ‚Äåa Cake Baked in a Tube Pan: Expert guide

Tube pan cakes, wiht their characteristic hole in the center, offer a unique canvas ‚Äçfor decorative expression. Unlike flat-layered cakes, their height and intricate internal architecture present both challenges and opportunities when it ‚Äåcomes to icing, glazing, and embellishment. ‚ÄåMastering the art of decorating these cakes transforms them from simple baked goods into stunning ‚Å¢centerpieces. This guide provides a comprehensive exploration of techniques, tips, and creative‚Å£ ideas, empowering you to decorate tube pan‚Äç cakes‚Å¢ with professional‚Äã flair.

**Understanding the Tube ‚Å£Pan Cake Structure**

unlike standard layer cakes, tube ‚Äãpan cakes ‚Äçoften ‚Å£possess a delicate, airy crumb. This results from recipes which utilize‚Äã whipped egg whites‚Å¢ extensively. This delicate structure is both an advantage (for absorbing ‚Äåflavor) and a disadvantage (for structural rigidity when decorating). The characteristic hole is not merely aesthetic;‚Å§ it facilitates even ‚Å¢baking and cooling, preventing a dense, uncooked center.‚Å§ Recognizing the inherent nature of your tube pan ‚Å§cake ‚Äì its texture, moisture content, and overall‚Å§ stability ‚Å£‚Äìis the first crucial step toward accomplished decoration. Heavier ‚Å£glazes might crush a very aerated cake; a dry ‚Å£cake might benefit from a rich, moist frosting.

**Choosing the Right decoration Method**

The decoration method you select should complement both the flavor‚Å£ and the texture of ‚Äçyour tube pan ‚Äçcake. For‚Å£ lighter, chiffon-style cakes, ‚Äåa simple dusting‚Å¢ of‚Å¢ powdered sugar or a light glaze might be preferable. Richer bundt cakes, ‚Äãon the other hand, can‚Äã stand up to more elaborate‚Å£ frostings and ‚Å¢toppings. Consider the overall effect‚Äã you want to achieve ‚Äì elegant simplicity or decadent indulgence ‚Äì ‚Å£and tailor your‚Å¢ decorative choices accordingly. Also,the event for which you are baking the cake dramatically influences ‚Å¢your decoration choice. A casual ‚Å¢gathering might call for a rustic, unfrosted‚Å£ cake dusted ‚Äçwith‚Å£ powdered sugar, while‚Å£ a celebratory occasion may warrant ‚Å¢a multi-layered frosting extravaganza.

**Preparing the Cake for Decoration**

Proper preparation is paramount. Before you even think about ‚Äçfrosting, ensure the cake is fully cooled. Warm cake will‚Äç cause icings and glazes to ‚Äåmelt, leading to a messy and unstable final ‚Å£product. ‚Å¢Carefully invert the cake‚Äã onto‚Å§ a wire rack ‚Å§to‚Äã cool completely.if the cake sticks, gently loosen it with ‚Äça thin spatula or knife, being careful not to ‚Å§tear the delicate crumb. ‚Å£For some recipes,chilling the cake in the refrigerator for a short period can firm‚Äç it up,making ‚Å£it ‚Äãeasier to handle and decorate.‚Å£ Once cooled, examine the cake‚Äå for any imperfections, such as cracks or‚Å£ uneven surfaces. ‚ÄçSmall cracks can be filled with frosting ‚Äåor glaze. Larger imperfections may require creative camouflage with strategically placed decorations.

**Simple Dusting and‚Å£ Glazes**

For a minimalist yet elegant look,‚Å§ consider a simple dusting of powdered sugar or‚Å¢ a light glaze. these options‚Å¢ are particularly ‚Äçwell-suited for cakes with intricate patterns or rich, ‚Å§intense flavors‚Å§ that don't need heavy frosting.

*   **Powdered Sugar:** ‚Å§use a fine-mesh ‚Äãsieve to evenly dust the cooled cake ‚Äçwith powdered sugar.This creates a ‚Äçdelicate, snow-like appearance. For added flavor, mix the powdered sugar with a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, or cocoa powder.To prevent the sugar from dissolving into‚Äå the cake's surface, apply‚Äã it shortly before serving.*   **Glazes:** Glazes are thin, pourable icings made from powdered ‚Äçsugar ‚Äãand a liquid, ‚Å¢such as milk, juice, coffee, ‚Å£or liquor. Adjust the‚Å§ liquid to powdered sugar ratio‚Å§ to achieve the ‚Å§desired consistency. A thinner‚Äç glaze will‚Äå create a translucent ‚Å¢coating,while a thicker ‚Å£glaze ‚Å£will provide more opaque coverage. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake, allowing it to drip‚Äã down the sides. For a more even‚Å§ coating, place ‚Å§the cake on a wire rack‚Äã over a baking‚Å§ sheet to catch any excess glaze. ‚ÄãExperiment with different flavor ‚Å£combinations: lemon ‚Äãglaze, chocolate glaze, coffee glaze, or even a spiced glaze.

**frosting ‚ÄçTechniques**

for‚Äå a more substantial and decadent‚Å¢ decoration, frosting is an excellent choice. However, frosting‚Äç a tube‚Äç pan cake‚Å¢ requires ‚Å§a slightly ‚Å£different‚Å£ approach‚Å¢ than frosting a standard layer cake.

   **choosing the Right Frosting:** Select a ‚Å§frosting that complements the cake's flavor and texture. Buttercream frosting is a classic choice, providing a smooth and creamy finish. Cream‚Äå cheese frosting adds a tangy note that pairs‚Å¢ well with many cake flavors. For a lighter option, consider‚Å§ whipped‚Å£ cream ‚Å§frosting or meringue ‚Äåfrosting.

   **Crumb Coat:** Before applying the final ‚Å¢layer of ‚Äåfrosting,apply a thin ""crumb ‚Äãcoat"" to seal in any loose ‚Äãcrumbs.‚Äç This helps to create a‚Å£ smooth and even surface for the final frosting layer. Chill the crumb-coated cake in‚Äã the refrigerator for 15-20 minutes to allow ‚Äåthe crumb coat to set.

   **Frosting Request:** Use an offset‚Äå spatula or a piping bag to apply the frosting evenly over the cake. Start at the‚Äå top and work your way down the sides.For a smooth finish, use the spatula to gently smooth ‚Å§the frosting. You can also create decorative swirls or textures with the ‚Äãspatula or a fork. The interior‚Å§ hole can be frosted‚Å¢ as well, creating a decorative ring of cream.

**Drip Cakes**

Drip ‚Äãcakes are visually stunning and relatively easy to ‚Äåcreate. Thay add a touch‚Å§ of elegance and sophistication to any‚Äç tube pan cake.

   **Preparing the‚Å¢ Drip:** ‚Å§ A drip cake utilizes a ganache (chocolate and‚Äå cream)‚Å¢ or a‚Äã candy melt mixture.The ideal consistency is‚Å§ crucial: too ‚Äçthick, and ‚Å§it won‚Äôt drip properly; too thin, and‚Äç it will run ‚Å¢excessively. Test the consistency by drizzling‚Äå a‚Äç small amount down ‚Äãthe side of a glass before applying it to the cake.

   **Applying the ‚Å§Drip:** pour the ganache‚Äã or candy ‚Äåmelts over ‚Äåthe ‚Äçtop of‚Äã the‚Äã cake, allowing it to drip down the sides. Use ‚Äça spoon or a spatula to guide the drips and create the desired effect. You can create short, controlled drips or longer, more‚Äç dramatic‚Å¢ drips.

   **Embellishments:** ‚Å£ While ‚Å¢the ‚Äãdrip is still wet, embellish with sprinkles, chopped nuts, candies, or ‚Å§fresh fruit. These will adhere to the drip, creating a visually appealing and textural ‚Äãcontrast.

**Creative Embellishments and Toppings**

The possibilities for embellishing‚Äå a tube pan cake‚Äç are endless. here are ‚Å£a few ideas to ‚Å¢get you‚Å£ started:

   **Fresh Fruit:** Arrange fresh berries,sliced ‚Äçcitrus ‚Å¢fruits,or other‚Å§ seasonal fruits on ‚Å§top of the cake or‚Äç around the base. Fruit adds‚Å§ color, flavor, and a ‚Å£touch of natural elegance. Dust the fruit with powdered sugar for ‚Å£a polished look.

   **Edible Flowers:** Decorate the cake with edible flowers, such as pansies, violets, or roses. Edible flowers ‚Äåadd a ‚Äãtouch of whimsy and sophistication.Make sure the flowers are properly cleaned and pesticide-free before using them.

   **Nuts and Sprinkles:** ‚Äå Sprinkle chopped nuts, sprinkles, or chocolate shavings over the frosting or glaze. These add‚Äã texture, flavor, and visual interest.

   **Caramel or Chocolate Sauce:** Drizzle caramel or ‚Å¢chocolate sauce over‚Äç the cake for a decadent‚Äå and indulgent touch.

   **Candies:** Arrange candies, such as mini chocolate chips, M&Ms, or gumdrops, ‚Äåon top of the cake. candies add color and a playful touch.

   **Whipped Cream:** Top the cake with a dollop of whipped cream ‚Å£or a rosette of piped whipped cream. Whipped cream adds lightness and a touch of‚Å£ elegance.

**Adapting Decorations ‚Äåfor ‚Å¢different Occasions**

Consider the occasion when selecting ‚Å§decorations. The ‚Å¢decorations can easily ‚Å§be tailored to fit‚Å£ the specific themes of several events.   **Holidays:** For holiday celebrations, incorporate seasonal colors and decorations.Use red and green sprinkles for‚Å¢ Christmas, pastel colors for Easter, ‚Äãor orange and black decorations for Halloween.

   **Birthdays:** ‚Å§ Personalize the cake with birthday candles, a number cake ‚Å¢topper, or a message written in frosting.   **Weddings:** Create ‚Äãan elegant and elegant‚Å§ cake with white frosting, edible flowers, and delicate ‚Å£decorations.

   **Anniversaries:** Decorate the ‚Å¢cake with anniversary-themed decorations, such as hearts, ‚Äåthe couple's initials, or ‚Äãthe anniversary year.

**Tips for Success**

   **Use High-Quality Ingredients:** Using high-quality ingredients will‚Å£ result in a better-tasting cake and more visually appealing decorations.

   **Don't Be ‚Å£Afraid to Experiment:** Experiment with different flavors, decorations, and techniques to find what works ‚Äçbest for you.

   **Practice Makes Perfect:** ‚Äå The more you decorate, the better you will become.

   **Take Your Time:** ‚Å¢Don't rush the decoration ‚Å£process. Take your time and enjoy the creative ‚Å£process.

*   **Have Fun:** Decorating a ‚Å§cake should be enjoyable. Relax and have fun with it!

By mastering ‚Äçthese ‚Äåtechniques and ‚Äãembracing your creativity, you can transform‚Äç ordinary‚Å§ tube pan cakes into unusual works of art. The key is to‚Å¢ understand the cake's structure, select the appropriate decoration ‚Å¢method, and‚Äã pay ‚Äãattention to detail.With ‚Äça little practice and imagination, you will be creating‚Äã stunning tube pan cakes that are sure to impress.

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôm 17 and getting ready for my senior year of high school and soon collage,and William has been even worse now,he yells more often and is more aggressive towards me, he has 2 older sons (m26) and (m34) who he has constantly been comparing me to and he doesn‚Äôt even make an effort to make it seem like he cares anymore, he lashes out at me for the simplest things and says that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be able to live on my own‚Äù because of how I act, but when did my personality cross with my ability to live a normal life ?,it‚Äôs like in his eyes his older biological kids could do no wrong but when I do anything wrong,all the sudden I‚Äôm the devil sent from hell,he‚Äôs even tried to make my own mom think that I‚Äôm crazy by making up things that happened while she was away that never actually happened or showing a bruise he got from running into a coffee table and saying that I kicked him and was being defiant,he doesn‚Äôt let me dress how I want, my style is more alternative and he makes me dress like I‚Äôm one of those preppy girls and I dyed my hair black to try and alter my appearance maybe just a little and when he found out he flipped saying I looked ‚Äúeasy‚Äù.

I‚Äôm genuinely a very introverted person but something in him makes me snap,he disrespects my mother and he disrespects me on the daily and says ‚Äúif you weren‚Äôt here things would be a lot easier‚Äù, I know that isn‚Äôt true but it hurts, I‚Äôve grown to hate and resent my moms boyfriend,hate is a strong word I‚Äôll admit but if someone treated you like an object or a disappointment all your life I feel like you‚Äôd get it to.

But here‚Äôs something guys rarely think about:

**What happens to your PE control when you cut back on caffeine or quit altogether?**

Caffeine withdrawal can temporarily mess with your mood, energy, and body sensitivity ‚Äî all of which may affect how well you manage arousal. Let‚Äôs break it down.

**What Happens During Caffeine Withdrawal**

* **Increased Irritability and Anxiety:** Your nervous system is adjusting to lower stimulant levels, which can make you more restless or tense in the short term.
* **Higher Sensitivity:** Some men notice that without caffeine, they feel more ‚Äúon edge‚Äù physically and mentally before their body adjusts ‚Äî which might spike arousal faster during sex.
* **Low Energy or Brain Fog:** Feeling off or sluggish can make it harder to focus on breath control or pacing during intimacy.

These withdrawal effects usually peak within the first few days and taper off after a week or two.

**Why This Matters for PE**

If you stop caffeine suddenly, you may notice:

* Harder time managing nerves or arousal during the adjustment period.
* Feeling distracted or frustrated during sex, which could throw off your pacing.
* Increased pelvic tension if your body is holding extra stress during withdrawal.

The key is knowing this phase is **temporary** and can be managed with a few simple strategies.

**A User‚Äôs Experience**

One user shared that when he quit coffee cold turkey, his anxiety spiked for a few days, and he noticed he climaxed faster during sex, even though he had been making progress before. After about two weeks, things settled, and he found his arousal and control improved ‚Äî especially without the jittery energy caffeine used to bring.

**How to Manage PE During Caffeine Withdrawal**

* **Taper Off Slowly:** Gradually reduce caffeine intake over a week or two to avoid a sharp withdrawal spike.
* **Prioritize Sleep and Hydration:** Both help regulate your nervous system during the adjustment period.
* **Practice Relaxation Techniques:** Use breathing exercises, meditation, or light stretching to keep your baseline tension low.
* **Be Patient With Yourself:** If your control feels off during the first few days, know it‚Äôs likely just a phase.

**Takeaway**

Cutting back on caffeine can help your PE control long-term, but the short-term withdrawal phase might temporarily throw things off. With a little patience and smart management, you‚Äôll likely come out of it with better overall control and less anxiety in the bedroom.

The thing about content that ranks is that there‚Äôs much more than filling the text with keywords; technically speaking, an SEO-friendly content writer produces content that obviously search engines overlook and tend to raise at the top in their results.¬†Therefore, whenever your site is displayed on the first page, users will irregularly end up clicking, sharing, and interacting with it. Nevertheless, getting that nice balance is crucial: Google prefers longer articles, yet your content should stay relevant and not padded with unnecessary details. how to make a blog seo friendly

In this expert guide, we will delve into tried-and-true methods that continue to work in 2025, essential structuring skills for better rankings, and useful tools for helping to clear up your optimization process. Whether you‚Äôre an established content creator or just beginning, these practical tips will enable your content to rank and genuinely reach its targeted audience. how to make a blog seo friendly

# 8 Expert Tips for Writing SEO-Friendly Content in 2025

Crafting genuinely impactful SEO content in 2025 demands more than mere technical skills. Let me share eight expert strategies that will help your content both rank well and engage readers. how to make a blog seo friendly

Understand search intent first.¬†Search engines now prioritize content that aligns with user intent. Google‚Äôs sophisticated ranking algorithms have evolved dramatically to interpret complex queries and user context. Furthermore, Google‚Äôs helpful content update prioritizes genuinely useful content over content created primarily to rank. This means digging deep into what your audience really wants when they search. how to make a blog seo friendly

Structure content strategically. Break your content into clear sections with descriptive headings to allow users to scan quickly and find the information they need. Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences) significantly improve readability, especially on mobile.

Prioritize readability. Use plain language, logical flow, and easy-to-skim formatting.¬†Discuss key information first in each section and use bullet points to make important points stand out. how to make a blog seo friendly

Optimize images properly. Images bring pages to life and contribute to your website‚Äôs SEO. Use descriptive file names that include your focus keywords, add comprehensive alt text, and compress images to maintain fast loading times.

Create thoughtful internal links. Internal linking helps Google understand your site‚Äôs structure while guiding users toward deeper engagement. Link to high-performing or thematically related content using natural anchor text.

Use synonyms and related keywords. Incorporating synonyms and related keywords helps Google understand the context of your text, increasing your chances of ranking for various search queries.¬†This approach makes your content more readable while still focusing on your chosen keyphrase. how to make a blog seo friendly

# How to Structure Your Content for Better Rankings

According to research, webpages with visuals receive 94% more page views than those without.¬†This impressive statistic demonstrates why structural elements matter so much for engagement.

# Strategic keyword placement remains essential for optimizing your content structure:

Place your primary keyword in title tags, subheadings, introduction, conclusion, meta descriptions, URLs, and image alt text  
Include your main keyword within the first 100 words of your content

Use secondary keywords naturally throughout your H2 and H3 subheadings Moreover, implementing schema markup (structured data) helps search engines better understand your content.¬†This standardized format provides information about your page and classifies content, potentially enabling more engaging search results. Adding structured data can make your content eligible for rich snippets enhanced search results that stand out and attract more clicks.

Notably, the human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text, explaining why visual elements are crucial for engagement.¬†For images to contribute to your SEO, include descriptive file names with focus keywords and comprehensive alt text.

Transition words serve as the glue holding your content together, improving readability and user experience‚Äîfactors search engines interpret as quality markers. These linguistic signposts guide readers through your text while signaling relationships between ideas, making complex concepts more digestible.

We've spent years experimenting with various brewing methods, from pour-over to Aeropress, but always dreamed of that perfect, barista-style espresso at home. That's why we invested in the [Philips 3200 Series Fully Automatic Espresso Machine](https://amzn.to/4lXVxeE).  Over the past few months, it‚Äôs become a daily ritual in our kitchen, and I'm ready to share our experience.

## Ease of Use

Setting up the Philips 3200 was surprisingly straightforward.  The intuitive interface guided us through the initial steps, and the included instruction manual was clear and concise (a rarity!).  Daily operation is incredibly simple; selecting your drink choice and pressing start is all it takes.  The integrated milk frother is also easy to clean, which is a huge plus for busy mornings. The only minor learning curve involved mastering the bean grinder settings to achieve our preferred espresso consistency, but even that was quickly overcome.

## Espresso Quality

The espresso produced by this machine consistently impresses.  The crema is rich and thick, and the espresso itself is flavorful and well-balanced.  We've experimented with various types of beans, and the 3200 consistently extracts excellent shots, even with darker roasts that can be challenging for some machines. The adjustable settings allow for customization, which is crucial for fine-tuning the brew to individual preferences.

## Milk Frothing Capabilities

The integrated milk frother is a highlight. It produces wonderfully textured microfoam, ideal for lattes and cappuccinos.  The adjustable frothing settings allow you to tailor the texture to your liking, from velvety smooth to slightly firmer for latte art. Cleaning the frother is a breeze; it‚Äôs mostly dishwasher-safe and also easy to rinse by hand.

## Maintenance & Cleaning

While the Philips 3200 requires some regular maintenance, it‚Äôs far less demanding than some other automatic machines.  Descaling is easily prompted by the machine itself, and the drip tray and used coffee grounds container are easily accessible.  Regular cleaning is straightforward, mostly involving wiping down surfaces and occasionally rinsing components.

## Durability & Build Quality

The Philips 3200 feels substantial and well-built. The machine's casing is made of high-quality plastic that feels durable, and the components work smoothly and quietly. After several months of daily use, there are no signs of wear and tear.  While it‚Äôs not a small appliance, its size is proportional to its functionality.

## Variety of Drinks

Beyond espresso, the Philips 3200 offers a range of coffee and milk-based beverages, including lattes, cappuccinos, and even hot water for tea.  The choice of drink is simple to select, ensuring that everyone in the household can enjoy their ideal cup of coffee. The ability to customize settings for strength and volume adds further versatility.

## Value for Money

Pros:
* Excellent Espresso Quality
* Easy to Use and Clean
* Versatile Drink Options
* Durable Build
* Integrated Milk Frother

Cons:
* Price point (at the higher end for home espresso machines)
* Can be a bit large for smaller kitchens

At $500, the Philips 3200 sits in the mid-range of fully automatic espresso machines.  Compared to similar machines like the De'Longhi ECAM22.110B Magnifica S, which is often priced slightly lower, the Philips offers superior milk frothing capabilities and a more user-friendly interface. While there are more expensive options on the market, the 3200 provides exceptional value for its combination of features, performance, and ease of use. It's a premium pick for those who want a convenient yet high-quality espresso experience without breaking the bank.

Final Verdict & Recommendation:

The Philips 3200 Series Fully Automatic Espresso Machine is a fantastic addition to any coffee lover's kitchen. Its ease of use, excellent espresso quality, and versatile drink options make it a worthwhile investment.  Highly recommended for those seeking a step up from manual espresso machines or those who want a hassle-free yet delicious cup of coffee every morning.",1,1752757248.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False

So this morning I‚Äôm sitting on the couch, sipping my coffee, and contemplating doing nothing for the foreseeable future when I hear it‚Äî
BEEP.

Just one. Sharp. Condescending. Loud enough to startle the cat.
I look around. Nothing obvious. Maybe it was outside.
A few minutes later:
BEEP.

Okay, not outside. Not the fridge. Not the microwave. Not my soul (although, maybe?). I know that beep. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúyour fire alarm battery is low, you irresponsible adult‚Äù beep.

I stare at the ceiling like it personally insulted me. Which, to be fair, it kinda did.
But here‚Äôs the kicker: I have five smoke detectors. All white. All identical. All equally smug.

Now begins the quest. I stand under each one like some weird bat-whisperer, waiting in silence like an idiot for the next chirp. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt beep when I want it to. It waits until I‚Äôm across the room.
BEEP.
I run back. Stand again. Wait.
Nothing.

Eventually, I find the culprit (probably‚Äîit beeped while I was under it and I felt its guilt). I drag out the stepladder, climb up in my pajamas, pop it open‚Ä¶ no battery.
No battery??

Apparently, this one is hardwired with a backup battery. Which has now failed. I pull the old 9-volt out. The beep stops. Peace.

I don‚Äôt have a new battery. Of course I don‚Äôt. So I go to the store, buy a 6-pack because they come in sixes for reasons no one understands, come back, plug it in.

It beeps.
BEEP.
Not a low battery beep. A ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been tampered with‚Äù beep.

I reset it.
It beeps.

Eventually, I have to take it down, press a hidden button, hold it for five seconds, spin around three times and promise it my firstborn before it agrees to be silent again.

Anyway, now I‚Äôm back on the couch. Coffee‚Äôs cold. Cat‚Äôs mad.
But the house probably won‚Äôt burn down.

The end.
Or until next time:

I posted [3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/hyperacusis/comments/1jzq6ch/starting_my_soundbites_24_weeks_test_treatment/) that I was starting taking Soundbites complements - after reading about [a positive experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/hyperacusis/comments/1jcnu2s/you_need_to_try_soundbites/) on this sub. I told you guys I‚Äôd keep you updated, but for starters, I have had moderate h more +10 years and moderate t for +2 years.

I have started feeling improvements 2 months after taking the complement daily. I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs gonna last and I can‚Äôt say for sure the improvement is a straight result of taking Soundbites, but I do know my sensitivity has reduced a lot over the last few weeks. Specific things I noticed:

* The coffee grinding machine sound almost doesn‚Äôt bother me in the morning - whereas I had to plug my ears and leave the kitchen before
* I feel like grabbing my guitar several times a week now - I had completely stopped because it hurt my ears and generate reactive t
* The only moment I can hear my t is at night in my bed (used to be throughout the whole day)

Here is the Soundbites website if you want to check it out: [https://soundbites.com/](https://soundbites.com/) and feel free to send me DM if you have a question. **Please don‚Äôt bother to comment if you**‚Äô**re gonna be hateful/negative/hurtful.**

* *But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to suggest that something be done for me. Indeed, I would rather die than let anyone nullify my boast.*

**Dr. George MacDonald once said** that the best thing about our rights is that, since they belong to us, we can give them up if we choose.

Paul explained that he had certain undeniable rights as an apostle and minister of Christ. He even quoted Old Testament law to back it up. The law said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt muzzle the ox while it‚Äôs treading out the grain.‚Äù God wasn‚Äôt just thinking about oxen when He gave that law; He was thinking about His servants. They have the right to be supported by the people they serve. But Paul gave up that right. He preached the gospel without asking for payment.

Many pastors and Christian workers do the same thing, either fully or partially. Anyone who loves Christ should be willing to make sacrifices to do His work and spread His message.

1m26nhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1m26nhz/my_m28_girlfriend_f23_is_exhausting_me_and_i_can/,My (M28) girlfriend (F23) is exhausting me and I can no longer think straight. Do you have advice?,"Me and my GF met 4-5 months ago in a bar, we hooked up for sex in the first night then we started chatting a lot via messages. After 1 month of hooking up and talking more freely, open and going more for coffee walks and stuff, I for one started to catch feelings and one day I confessed, saying she wanted to say the same. Even brought her home to meet my parents. I initially thought we had potential... she's spiritual, says she wants peace, harmony, a loving relationship, etc. But in time, her actions haven't matched her words at all.

**So a summary, ok?** 

* Lately I make **most of the effort**: initiating conversation, asking how she‚Äôs doing, trying to be emotionally present and supportive. At the start of our relationship and UNTIL mid-June, everything was ok, she was lovey-dovey and all. She was broke when we met, motivated her to get a good job, start saving money, get her relation with her parents to be healthier etc. Since we met, she had; 1 job that lasted 5 days, 1 job that lasted 2-3 weeks, 1 job that lasted 3 weeks. She left her last job telling me that she wants to enroll in the Army because salary is stable, and now she's not even preparing for it, instead she's looking for other jobs because she lost motivation. 
* She barely texts, rarely asks how I am, and often replies **dryly or indifferently**. If I don't text, she vanishes. We've had like 6 conversations until today saying that I don't feel that energy from her anymore, her tone is different, she's different face-to-face. She says that it's easier for her to express herself when we're together, not via message, because ""you know how I am.""
* Any time I try to open up or ask for more communication, she either avoids the topic or gets cold/defensive. She has a passive-aggressive way of communicating when we argue and that irritates me. I've always asked her ""Have you ever felt that I don't love you in my way of talking, be it messages or voice?"" and she always said ""No."".
* She says she likes being in a relationship, that ‚Äúthings will be better when we live together,‚Äù but **nothing actually changes**. Last Friday we talked, she left her job saying she'll prepare for Army (desk position is what she wants) and I brought her home to sleep over for 2 nights. On Sunday my mum asked her if she's staying this night too and GF felt attacked, mother having no ill-intention. Also, GF makes the bed, she washes her stuff after eating, etc but not always. We had to make pancakes and I took the role of cleaning the plates and mum asked ""YOU are doing the dishes?"" and GF felt even more attacked, leading to a conversation last night where GF told me she won't be coming anymore to my home because she's feeling that despite doing what she can, she doesn't want to fight for this, to change my mother's impression over her. That things will get better when we move together, she'll take care of me, work, etc. She told me last night that she's not trying to fix this, to come back to sleep the nights at my place so that ""there won't be any fights between me and your mum or tension between you two."" 
* She even told me not to involve my mom in anything related to us, despite the fact that my mom is extremely supportive and kind. She‚Äôs **disrespectful** toward my family in general, without reason.
* We talked 3 months ago to have her tested for STDs, or atleast get prescription for contraception. She hasn't done this even today, despite her having a lot of free time. We had unprotected sex (last week), but I've made sure to always pull out, never finish in her. After the first round, I've always used condoms to not take any risks. Also, at the beginning of our relationship i took an STD test and results came back CLEAN for everything.
* Her words and actions somehow... never align. She didn't spend any money in our relationship, except for a single icecream, a shirt for my birthday and a keychain. That's all. I however have bought everytime when we were going out (take her out, return her to her parents always VIA personal car), coffee for both, cigarettes when she didn't have, soda, food, chocolate. ""When I'll have money, I'll help too."" yet, not happened in our meets.
* Last night after leaving her at home, she didn't have her keys so she woke her mum up at 02:00 in the night to let her in. Her mum started swearing and I asked her if she was ok, if her mum told her anything. GF said :""No one is lecturing me on what to do.""
* She invokes stress as an excuse for everything lately. She focuses on the future that she wants with me in order to cover the present actions.
* She RARELY even says ""Good morning"" to me, she's not asking how I am, If i'm doing OK with studying because I have an important exam coming in 1 week, nothing. She barely says she's sorry...

**My family recently found out stuff about her and things blew up...**

I'm from a small town and my grandmother, without asking her, started asking questiong about her (grandma and GF are from same town, grandma knows all about that town). Apparently this girl has **a very bad reputation.** She's been with rroms, that she's a ... not a good woman for me. Everyone from my family is worried about me.

I wanted to believe that she can change, that she's a new person, trying to invest in her health, knowledge, wealth whatever...

**Where I'm at now:**

* I feel like **I'm the only one investing in this.**
* I‚Äôve started losing my self-esteem and overthinking every tiny reply she gives.
* I‚Äôve become emotionally dependent on any small bit of attention from her.
* I haven‚Äôt been able to focus well on work or study.
* I told her today that I‚Äôll be ‚Äúin monk mode‚Äù and studying intensely, just to **detach and stop caring so much**. Her response after last night's conversation? ""Okay, look, I'll be leaving for X city anyway."" Not even a ""You can do it!"", ""Keep up the good work!"", nothing. 

**What I need from your...:**

* Am I being manipulated?
* Would you consider this relationship dead? Because right now I'm at my breaking point.

**TL;DR:**

I‚Äôve been in a relationship where I gave everything and got very little in return. My girlfriend avoids effort, responsibility, and honest conversations. My family just told me she has a dark past and that I‚Äôm destroying myself staying with her. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôve been manipulated and whether it‚Äôs time to walk away completely.

I glance at my little camera preview‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs me, sipping coffee with a very clear coffin, a cross, and a ‚ÄúRest in Peace‚Äù flower arrangement behind me.

Usually 4-5.5 hours of walking. I'm a dogwalker. Just in this last week, something shifted. Despite the temp being in the 90's all week as it has been for a few weeks, the heat isn't getting to me as much any more. I'm not dragging for the last few miles of my day and if anything, have more pep in my step all day long. I'm sweating a little less. Getting less red in the face. It feels like my body is getting more efficient at doing these walks, or at least, I'm fully understanding now how to fuel my body properly, dress properly, recover properly, which is making it all feel so much easier?

Just wanted to share what has been working for me. I wake up about 5-6 hours before I walk. I start fueling then by having some water just after waking, followed by a coffee protein shake with about 15-18g of protein. Then I'll have a light breakfast about 2-3 hours before walking (I typically start walking at 11:30am). My breakfast is usually a kale, black bean and tofu scramble or a yogurt with 15g of protein topped with peanut butter. I'll keep drinking water throughout the morning before my walk, but try to stop drinking 1-1.5 hours before so I don't have to pee when I'm walking. That is the main reason for fueling earlier, is I wont have to go to the bathroom on my walk (bathrooms are hard to come by where I walk dogs).

After I start walking, about 30 mins in I'll usually take a SaltStick electrolyte chewable and I'll continue having them every 30 mins to an hour usually throughout my walk. I drink water as needed (I carry two small water bottles that I refill throughout my walk). 1.5 hours in-2 hours in is usually when I'll have lunch, which is a grape jelly Uncrustable and some water. They are very easy to carry and don't fall apart and get messy in my bag. They also fuel me really well. I'll continue with the electrolytes and water for the rest of my walk, and also carry a handful of ""energy bites"" of some sort (the ones I currently am eating are from Gluten Free Brothers) in case I need a pick me up. 

After my walk, I have a big Nalgene of water in my car and usually drink half of it on my ride home once I know a bathroom is in my near future :)

  
Right after I get home, I have another protein drink, typically 15g of protein, followed by dinner a few hours later, something fiber and protein rich with lots of veggies, greens, and often beans or tofu.

I drink more water throughout the evening, and finish my day with a big glass of water to wash down some CALM brand magnesium citrate with, which seems to help me with muscle relaxation and recovery as well as keeping my restless leg syndrome at bay so I can sleep well. 

As for gear, I walk in athletic moisture-wicking clothing. I tried natural fibers, but found they get too water logged, heavy feeling against the skin and chafe me. Athletic clothing is where it's at for me. I rotate between some UPF sun shirts from Mountain Hardwear, SPYDER, and KUHL with Mountain Hardwear and Puma fast wicking shorts. I wear either Darn Tough wool hiking socks or Balega running socks. I rotate between 3 running shoes - a pair of ON, a pair of Brooks, and a pair of HOKA. I always wear a fast drying baseball cap or a sun hat, and always have waterproof sunscreen (spf 50) on. I have a cheap running vest from Amazon that I hold my water bottles in, and a waitpack that holds my food, phone, and extra stuff I need for work.

This is what I've found works well for me and just wanted to share in case it's helpful to someone else. Let me know if you have any questions!",8,1752756108.0,walking,1,0.91,False

1m26gov,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/1m26gov/mapping_advice/,Mapping advice,"Has anyone got any tips for how to stop their Roborock going near metal-based furniture? 

I have a round nested coffee table set in my family room consists of two tables (each with a metal frame) and both have a round footprint at floor level. There are also 3 bar stools at my kitchen counter which also have round metal bases (both are chrome). 

I'm struggling to get my Roborock to stay away from them and the plastic detangling comb (I have a Saros Z70) is marking the metal underneath the tables.

While the robot has recognised and marked the bar stools as pedestals on it's map, it's not avoiding them, and it's not recognising the tables at all (I guess because the frames aren't that solid). 

https://preview.redd.it/zmxl1876jfdf1.jpg?width=1206&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ff607972acfc5f6b7a04806416fddd17038389d

I've taken a measurement of the table and tried creating a no-go zone for it (I've since removed it as it's not working so it's missing from the above) however I can't seem to position it properly on the map so it's position on the floor is accurate and it doesn't end up preventing the robot from cleaning that part of the space (which it's currently not doing). I had a Roomba previously and it was possible to send it on Mapping Runs to update an existing map but having been right through the app for my Saros, it doesn't look like Roborock allows you to do that? 

I'd wait for it to recognise this over some cleaning runs but my problem is the damage it will do to the chrome on all of these in the meantime... 

Has anyone else come across the same challenge and found a decent way of resolving it? The robot is currently on trial with my parents, as I'm encouraging them to get one, and if it ruins any of their furniture, it's going to weaken my case for it! üòÜ",1,1752756001.0,Roborock,2,1.0,False

1m26f69,https://i.redd.it/j6ws7u94jfdf1.jpeg,Anyone know this novel?,"I had picked out a wedding Anniversary gift, and couldn't wait to see my husband. 
When I push the call room door open, my world came crashing down. 

There, having intercourse on the white sheets, were Carl and Dr. Eddi.
My closest friends sat on my husband and moved quickly up and down.
""Give it to me! Oh...Yes.""
The gift bag slipped from my fingers, falling to the floor with a soft thud. 
Tears welled up in my eyes before spilling over, hot and fast, as I turned and bolted. 
My legs carrying me away from that room, away from the betrayal, away from the life I thought I had a new beginnings.
I had no idea where I was going. 
I wiped away my tears and looked at the bar further down the street.
That's where I needed, to get drunk, to forget everything.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
It was our wedding anniversary day, and I was buzzing with excitement, I had told my Boss, Erin, that I‚Äôd be closing on time to see my husband at Saint Paul's, where he works, I quickly wrapped my work up, I was eager, desperate and even to surprise Carl,
Yesterday, our entanglement had been unforgettable, we had promised each other to sort things out, to open up, and to rebuild our trust. That conversation has lifted a weight off my shoulders.
I had picked out a small gift, nothing extravagant but something thoughtful, and a smile I couldn't wipe off my face. I couldn't wait to see him, to spend some quiet time together from work and from the world.
Immediately, I got out from my long drive. I held my little gift bag closely as I made my way to Carl's office, my heels clicking rhythmically on the cold, sterile floor; as I turned the corner, I saw one of the nurses, Nurse Leila, a friendly face which I recognized.
""Is Carl around?"", I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, but I couldn't hide the excitement.
"" He is probably in the call room,"" she replied with a smile.
I knew exactly where that was; I had been to that room more times than I could count, when we were newlyweds, to bring him a coffee or just to say hello. It was the place where I knew I could always find him anytime he was not in his office, and I was ready to share this moment with him.
Still smiling, I headed down the familiar hallway, my steps quickening with anticipation, The call room door was slightly ajar, and without thinking, I pushed it open, expecting to find Carl, maybe tired from his shift but always so glad to see me, But instead of finding him alone, my world came crashing down.
There, tangled in white sheets and in each other‚Äôs arms, were Carl and Dr. Eddie, one of our closest family friends.
Time froze.
My breath caught in my throat, and for a moment, I couldn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt process what my eyes were seeing. The gift bag slipped from my fingers, falling to the floor with a soft thud, but I barely heard it. My heart was racing, my pulse pounding in my ears, as the weight of the moment crushed me.
Tears welled up in my eyes before spilling over, hot and fast, as I turned and bolted. I didn‚Äôt think, I didn‚Äôt stop. I just ran, my legs carrying me away from that room, away from the betrayal, away from the life I thought I had and a life of new beginnings
I had no idea where I was going. My mind was a whirlwind of disbelief, of anger, of hurt. All I knew was I needed to get away from him, from this, from everything.
Hours later, I found myself in a dimly lit bar. The neon signs outside flickered as I stepped through the door, the smell of stale beer and cheap whiskey hanging in the air. I didn‚Äôt care. I needed to be anywhere but there.
The bartender glanced at me as I slid onto a barstool, my hands trembling as I wiped my tears, trying to pull myself together.
‚ÄúWhiskey,‚Äù I croaked, my voice thick with emotion.
The bartender raised an eyebrow but didn‚Äôt ask questions. He poured the drink and slid it over to me. I picked it up, not caring that it was too strong, too bitter. I needed something to numb the ache in my chest.
I stared into the glass, my mind spinning. My hands shook, the cold of the glass grounding me as I tried to make sense of what had just happened. Carl and Eddie. How long has this been going on? How had I not seen it? How had I been so blind?
I knocked back the whiskey in one go, the burn not doing anything to dull the pain in my heart. The tears started again, falling silently as I fought to breathe through the suffocating weight of betrayal. My wedding anniversary was our third year, and this was how it ended.
How had we gotten here? How have I gotten here?
I didn‚Äôt know what to do, where to go, or how to face him. The Carl I had known, the one who promised to never hurt me, the one who swore he would always be there, was gone. All I was left with was a stranger who had broken my trust in the worst way possible.
Another drink was placed in front of me, and I didn‚Äôt ask for it. I just took it.
And for a brief, fleeting moment, I allowed myself to forget, as the warmth of the whiskey settled into my stomach, spreading a dull haze over my thoughts. The noise of the bar, the clink of glasses, the murmur of conversations all felt so distant, so irrelevant. The world around me continued, people living their lives, oblivious to the chaos I was drowning in.
My mind kept replaying the scene in the call room, the sight of Carl's face, the way he looked when he saw me, the surprise that crossed his features before it melted into something else, something guarded. Eddie's presence beside him only amplified the sting, the realization that I wasn‚Äôt just betrayed by my husband, but by someone I had trusted, someone who had been a part of our lives for so long.
I pushed the thoughts away, not wanting to face them, not wanting to process the magnitude of what had just happened. I reached for the second drink, taking a slow sip, letting the burn pull me back into the moment, into the numbness.
I could feel the ache in my chest, a deep, hollow emptiness that I knew would take time to fill if it ever would. But I couldn‚Äôt think about that right now. I couldn‚Äôt think about what I was going to do, how I was going to face him, or how I could ever trust him again.
The bartender eyed me carefully, his expression softening as he leaned over the counter. ‚ÄúYou okay, sweetheart?‚Äù he asked, his voice low and gentle, as if he‚Äôd seen it all before.
I forced a smile, but I could feel how fake it was. ‚ÄúJust... just need a moment,‚Äù I muttered, my voice rough from the tears I had cried.
He nodded, and I appreciated his quiet understanding. He didn‚Äôt push, didn‚Äôt try to pry. Just let me be.
I took another sip of my drink, trying to focus on the taste, on the burn, on anything that could distract me from the whirlwind inside my mind. But nothing worked. The image of Carl and Eddie in that bed kept haunting me. The lies, the secrecy, the thought that I had been so sure of our love, was it all a lie? Had it been a lie from the start?
I heard the soft jingle of the bar door opening, followed by the shuffle of footsteps. I didn‚Äôt look up, but the sound of those footsteps grew closer and closer until they stopped beside me.",1,1752755879.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

My current methodology is as follows: 

1. Choose 3 different coffee blends and brew those three individually according to my test schedule 
2. Tests involve ratio & extraction times as follows: 1:5 vs. 1:10 & 18h vs. 24 
3. Each (12) brew is put in their own container and tested according to a Aroma, Flavor, Body, Acidity, Finish.

With that said, I have some questions for those of you who have already figured this out:

1. Should I be trying other A/B tests that could drastically change the outcome?
2. How long can I keep each brew in the fridge?
3. I have a Nitro Cold Brew keg and was thinking that once I find my 2 favorites, I would then compare both with Nitro. Should the Nitro test be done at a larger scale?
4. Should I consider making my own coffee blend? What would be the best way?

Additionally, I would really love, for fun, to put those coffees into cans or bottles and share them with some friends. Any tips on how I could do that?

I‚Äôve been thinking of a way to expand the capabilities of the Deeper Network, and I‚Äôd like to share an idea that I believe could significantly enhance its value and utility.

# Idea:

I propose building a **decentralized Wi-Fi mesh network** based on **Passpoint (Hotspot 2.0)** technology, integrated into the existing Deeper ecosystem.

# How it would work:

* **Deeper device owners** could enable mesh nodes either via:
   * Built-in Wi-Fi antennas,
   * External USB Wi-Fi adapters,
   * Or even existing enterprise-grade access points that support **Hotspot 2.0** (e.g. Cisco, Aruba, etc.).
* These nodes would form a global, seamless, encrypted mesh network that provides Wi-Fi internet access across various physical locations ‚Äî shopping malls, coffee shops, airports, residential buildings, etc.
* **Deeper device owners would earn DPR tokens** based on the volume of data transmitted through their access points.
* Each node would be **geotagged on a public map**, allowing users to easily locate nearby access points.

# On the client side:

* Users would install a **Deeper Mesh mobile app**, which:
   * Issues **offline access certificates** for seamless Passpoint authentication.
   * Implements **strong user verification** ‚Äî e.g., phone number tied to national ID (in countries with SIM ID registration laws), or other KYC methods ‚Äî to **prevent abuse and traffic inflation**.
* Every user would get a **base quota of free data (e.g. 5GB)**.
   * Additional data could be purchased using DPR tokens.
   * This creates an **economic incentive** and a sustainable funding model for the network.
* **Pricing should be geo-sensitive**:
   * The cost of data in tokens should always be lower than local ISP prices in each region, **in order to encourage long-term use of the mesh network as a viable alternative to traditional internet providers, particularly in residential and suburban areas where affordable and stable connectivity is often lacking.**
   * This ensures competitiveness and real-world usability.

# Additional Features:

* **Mobile devices would crowdsource real-time location verification** of mesh nodes and help maintain a **live coverage map**.
   * This feedback loop would reward node operators with additional tokens for verified uptime and usage.
* Devices with valid mesh certificates would **auto-connect** to the nearest verified Deeper mesh point, ensuring a seamless experience.

# Why this makes sense:

* Technically, this seems feasible within the current Deeper ecosystem and AtomOS framework.
* From a business and adoption standpoint, this model would:
   * Expand Deeper‚Äôs real-world utility far beyond VPN and DPN services.
   * Incentivize users to contribute to network coverage.
   * Enable a new revenue stream for DPR token holders and Wi-Fi providers.

**P.S.**  
I might be missing some technical details or may have misunderstood certain limitations, so feel free to correct me if I‚Äôm off track.  
As someone who manages extensive Wi-Fi infrastructure in shopping centers, I‚Äôve been looking for a way to **monetize** it in a secure and scalable manner. Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt found any viable solutions so far.

Apps like **WiFi Map** allow users to share public Wi-Fi passwords, but they are unreliable ‚Äî most credentials are outdated or simply wrong, and the user experience is far from ideal. However, a potential **collaboration with WiFi Map** might provide a bootstrap for adoption or help populate the initial coverage map.

1m26bc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m26bc9/are_those_red_flags/,Are those red flags?,"Hi, I (25F) have been with my bf (26M) for about 5 months now. He was the one to pursue me, I let it happen, and we got together so slowly/gradually that we don't even have a clear starting date lol

No one is perfect, so I am not and my bf isn't either. It's my first real relationship becasue I was perfectly okay being single so I never looked for someone. So I lack experience to really tell if something is wrong. I know love is about accepting someone fully, with the things we like and the little things we do not like about them. But sometimes the little things are not actually so little. I've always had trouble reading people and advocating for myself (i'm trying to work on that), and though I can accept his little things, my friends always make a face when I mention them to them...

So here are some little things he does :

- Sometimes, at his place, he doesn't ask me if I would like coffee too (i always say yes, so i don't think he assumes i don't want one) before he makes one for himself. Other times he asks, and he makes me a cup too

- He often asks for a massage to help with his shoulders, but still hasn't called an actual doctor to find a more efficient solution. I remind him to do so pretty much everytime he asks for a massage

- We don't talk much about things I like. Sometimes I share about my days or subjects I'm interested in, he listens but doesn't really engage. Sometimes it feels like he genuinely has no idea what to say. The only times he ask about what I am doing it's to see if I am free to invite me somewhere

- He likes teasing me. Sometimes it's fun, but when it's something I don't like I let him know, but he usually does it again eventually. Sometimes I tell him I'm not sure wether he is playing or being serious, but he doesn't always clarify the situation when I ask

- His work doesn't pay much, which I do not mind. But since he has little money, I am usually the one driving my car because I can afford gaz. His car also uses more gaz, I find myself often offering to participate in gaz money when we take his (he could but doesn't drive my car, but that's because she is a difficult lady so I am more reassured when i'm the one who drives her)

- Still about money : when we go out to eat or buy groceries to cook (and eat cheaply), we either split in half or I pay most of it. He has never offered to pay for us both, but to be fair I doubt he has the money for it. But when we are at our usual bar, since I am not fond of beer he sometimes (but it rarely happens) buys me a coffee

- He has a drinking problem. But he is aware and is careful to either have someone drive for him or he waits an hour or so before he takes the wheel. He has also taken substances on a couple exceptional occasions

- On one evening I was especially tired, at out usual bar, I told him I would like to go after he finished his drink (i was driving for us both). Someone offered him another beer afterwards and he accepted. We stayed nearly an hour longer while he finished that one

- At meal times, I always serve everyone first (especially if i am the one inviting) and I make sure everyone has a plate before digging in mine. He doesn't do that. He cooks for us, then makes himself a plate, goes to sit and starts eating before I am finished making mine. Sometimes I wonder if it's one of these examples of the difference between male vs female education

- He has lived through aweful things, and gets angry when talking about it. It's never against me or anyone involved, but by now I don't don't know what else more I can tell him to help him. He refuses to see a professional because he is convinced they will try to lock him in a psyc yard. I told him anger alone is not a good enough reason for them to do so, he would need to have already been violent or a danger to himself or others, but he doesn't believe me

- I've been self-consious about my musical skills lately. I am surrounded by musicians I am aware are better than me. We've met in jam sessions when I was still able to play freely. Now he often asks why I don't want to play with him anymore. I explained I was not avoiding him, that I just felt not good enough and like I would ruin everyone's music. He still asks, when I don't play, why I don't want to play with him. After repeating the same thing in different ways, I have given up answering him at all
(now i realise : maybe if i tell him that if he asked me to play with him rather than accuse me of not wanting to, it would make it easier for me to get stage)

Would you say those are red flags?

Outside of those little details he is a good person and he respects me. I have never had a reason to feel afraid of him, even when he gets angry

EDIT: since I am asking about red flags, of course I only talk about the bad things. But there are a lot of good things too that I cannot detail because it would make a very long post

Recently, I was shopping and passed a coffee shop, so I decided to go inside and buy some muffins. It was late, and they only had four chocolate ones and one strawberry one.  Anyway, I bought them and went home.

After a while, my daughter returned,  older son was at a friend's house, and  younger son was at his grandparents', and my husband was at work. My daughter finished dinner and asked if we had cake or anything like that. I told her we had muffins. She grabbed a strawberry one and went to her room. I didn't think much of it at that time. 

Later, sons returned, ate their chocolate muffins, and then went into their rooms. Finally, my husband returned, and as usual, we chatted about what had happened during the day.  At one point, I told him about my purchases and... that triggered a strange reaction in him. He interrupted me and asked where the strawberry muffin was. I told him my daughter ate it. He got angry? I don't even know how to describe it, he just went from casual conversation to complaining about both me and my daughter. At the end he said I shouldn't buy muffins at all or buy something else. After that he behaved normally, but this  still bothers me.

We'd do the polite nod in passing thing, maybe a ‚ÄúMorning‚Äù if we crossed paths at the mailbox, but that was about it.

Then came that winter night. My power had gone out, total blackout. I was sitting in my apartment, wrapped in a blanket, scrolling a dead phone screen out of habit, when I heard a knock at the door.

It was Mr. Harris. He held out a flashlight and a thermos without saying much. ‚ÄúThought you might need these,‚Äù he said.

Before I could even thank him properly, he turned and left.

A few minutes later, another knock.

Same man. This time with a heavy extension cord in hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a generator running. If you need to charge anything.‚Äù

This will be maybe a bit longer story and as I come from central Europe my English is not my mother language so I will try my best. 

First, I will add some background important information for this story. Me (30y.o., F) have know my best friend L(30 y.o., M) since kindergarten but we went to different schools and reunited when we were 20.  At the time I went to Iceland, find a job there and as he saw that on social media, he approached me to get some basic information about life there). Few months later he moved to Iceland and since then we become best friends. There is no chance that we could be something more than friends as first he is not my type , he is like brother to me and second, he is homosexual( I have no problem with that I really support this community as I have few homosexual friends). When back then I broke up with my boyfriend, L really helped me and offer to move in with him for a few months before I moved back to my country. At the time he broke up with his boyfriend as well, so it brought us closer together even more and we support each other emotionally . The time we spend under one roof together was amazing, we had a lot of fun, going out or just cooking at home etc.  After I have moved back home, we stayed in contact we had 2 hours long calls every few weeks( 1-2 times per month) and one per year I have visited him in Iceland and he usually visit our hometown where is his family, 2 times per year. Everything between us was great. 

But 2 years ago, we went for vacation to Canary Islands, he flew there from Iceland, our good friend H (who is from our hometown as well and she was my class mate at high school) flew from Scotland where she has been living for last 5 or 6 years and we just wanted to ravel and had great time together. So, we thought. We were talking about the places we would like to visit there and about some activities we have not planed anything ahead, but it was not such a problem. But in following day we started with H notice that L have made some passive aggressive comments towards us, mostly towards H. They got into the arguments few times.  As L since he broke up with his boyfriend( at the time it was already about 3 years before,) has been living alone I have noticed it was hard for him to compromise about things on a trip as where we go next, where to get accommodation or where we gonna eat. At the time I was more people pleaser ad I have not realize that back then. It is important to note that L works 6 day a weak and only time he goes out is to get grocery, or he goes to gym and swimming pool, rarely for a hike alone, so basically he does not have social life but I respect it as it is his life but I noticed that he gets easily irritated by people and loses his cool. After the vacation H was a bit disappointed with L , understandable, but after some time they spoke and everything was fine. The same year they made a plan for Christmas that L is coming for Christmas to Scotland to spend holiday with her and I was invited as well but decide to spend it with my family and help around. On Christmas morning H called me disappointed and mad that L changed his plans last minute and he is not coming( if she would know that with a time ahead, she could book flight tickets and flew back home and be with her family as well). I tried to reach L via phone and find out what was the reason for canceling plans with H at last minute. He just said that last weeks in work was super exhausted and he became anxious so decide not to go. At the time I tried to understand him and even called H afterwards to explain the actions of L and H just said that L should be more emphatic and basically, I have to agree with her now. Fast forward to next year when we decided to go again 3 of us to Canary Islands. H decided not to go, she canceled 1,5 months before the trip which was ok. During the trip we had with L multiple disagreements even of 1st day of the trip. He made comments on how slow I am walking, how he had to stop at gas station every hour as I needed the toilette( I just drink enough water to stay hydrated as I have a problem with lymph and it made my legs go swollen) even he knows I have intolerance for gluten and lactose and he chose always McDonald to eat there and later make comments that I am not skinny cause I eat trash food( which is not true) and I am lazy ( I am not , I love hiking and walking I just cannot do cardio workout as  I have a problem with hearth, fast heartbeat, and even taking medication for it, but I do yoga).He often made these comments and top it up with ‚ÄúI am just joking‚Äù phrase  and said there are man who loves these curvy women. I would not have a problem with my body if people would mind their business and give me their opinions on my body I have not ask for. I am not fat but either skinny just normal body type. He made me feel miserable at the trip, I tried to stay cool but could not prevent from upcoming arguments. The s*it hit the fan when he made video in the ocean with his brand-new iPhone (underwater) and later his new phone dies and he could not turn it on. Somehow it was my fault and rest of the trip he was mad at me. At the airport we say goodbye and I could not reach him after that, for 4-5 months. I even talk about the trip with H and she admit that she cancels the trip because she was afraid, he is gonna behave as the last time the year before. She was right but this time there was no one else so I was the only target but still I have found reason to excuse his behavior. He was my best friend for such a long time and we had so many good memories I did not want to give up on them. She tried to talk with L and after mentioned 4-5 month he wrote me and we started to have a regular call as before and apologize to each other.

Fast forward to this year.  My B Day is on beginning of Jully and we started to plan our trip together in May(please note that before trip we agreed to split finances for fuel and accommodation). He flew to our hometown for 3 weeks made appointments with doctors and dentist and our trip was scheduled on 5th of July, we went to south-west Czechia to canoeing, I was driving my car, and it took me almost 5 h to reach the destination. We decide to take a 4 days trip on river in canoe ( as renting company advised for beginners to take this rote which is easy and provided it should take 4 days) due to his instantly pushing and comments how weak I am , that I am not paddling correctly(even it was his first time on river, he acted like he knows the best) that I should stop paddling as he will handle that and 5 minutes later he said that I should help him etc. We reach our destination or river in 2,5 days. The weather was not the best it was raining and as I wanted to go hiking after for 2 or 3 days to nearby national park ( we talked about it before trip and agreed) he tried to change my mind to go to Germany visit some castles and Munich which I tried to reason with him that it is  more than 4 hours of driving away and it will be more expensive for both of us (my job is not as well paid as his in Iceland and I am paying the loan for my apartment so my finance are limited, I tried to keep it low cost even I had some money on side in case of emergency situation)  but finally I gave up and agreed as there was one place for hike I wanted to visit so I  consider it and agreed as I like old castles and historical  centers in cities ( mind that cost for accommodation and fuel should be split between two of us). We arrived in Munich around the midnight I was tired and ill as 2 days before we were camping and that night was really cold) I was not feeling well. Nex day we went to the center of Munich, parked car there and for 3 hours and went to explore the city center, first he was upset when I did not want to go with him to church tower as I was not feeling well but he kept quiet( I could read it from his face). We walked around the center grab a coffee and even we have still one hour before leaving the parking place we agreed to leave the center as there was a traffic due to the reconstruction on a road in center and there was still around 3 hours of driving to get to other destination. When we were approaching the parking lot, he decide to go to park which was nearby like 15 minutes of walking, I agreed as I knew at this point, he would get upset and I really did not want to argue with him. He pointed to another place he wanted to go but I remind him that we do not have much time but if he wants to go there, he can, and I will wait for him. He got upset and said that if I was not walking so slowly it would be easier . I remind him that we need to leave the parking lot in few minutes and there is traffic on road and also another  3 hours of driving and he really wanted to see that castle and it can be problem to reach it before the closing hours(so the next day we could go for short hike, only 7 km, and move to another destination, so I would not have to drive during the night exhausted again). He becomes angry and said that I do not need to be there, and I am acting like his mom and that we both wanted to go to Germany so I should not act like he should more appreciate me driving him around and Idnk what else. I stood there in disbelief I tried to recall previous day if I really made some comments or said something to make him feel that way. As more I tried to remember I started to see how he treated me during all trip, but I said nothing. He left , he was walking fast that I lost him in the street, but I went to a parking lot where I found him. He was quiet. I asked him if he can turn on the navigation on his phone and tell me where to go(as we did it like that during last days). He just told me where to turn with cold tone in his voice. When I looked at his phone, I saw the destination was our hometown. So, I asked him if he navigates me to the castle he wanted to visit. He replied : No, I want to go home! I told him that I have still few days of vacation and if he feels I hurt or mistreat him we can talk about that but as we even argued before I do not see reason why to cancel our trip too early. Even I have not been so comfortable as before I always believe that most of the problems can be talk out. He replied with : I want to go home. 
I told him that at least we can talk and after he decide that he wants to go home I can drive him to the train station, but I do not want to go back home and want to use the rest of my time to travel around and explore new places. He did not want to talk so I drove him to the station and as he was walking away, I told him to have a safe trip home. He did not even turn around. I felt so hurt . I knew at that moment I lost my best friend as I realized that it cannot make excuses for him anymore. He knew about my family situation and all stress I went though last months and how much I was looking forward to this trip with him to celebrate my 30th B Day and even I left him at the train station it felt like he was leaving me. I know that he is not going to reach me and to be honest I am not gonna try to reach him. I wanted to talk I wanted to know how I messed up as he was acted that he is the mistreated one. So , people of reddit, am I the AH? At least can you help me to maybe understand him better?

On a way to south Germany my car broke down, it had to be towed but fortunately they could repair some parts to be able to drive back home which took me 8 hours and I paid for fuel and mechanic, so I had to take from my savings. I feel so sad and frustrated and have feeling that L is too proud to text me first that he is willing to lose the friendship over it. But at the same time I know that I cannot go on like this anymore.

We just returned from an incredible 8 day adventure around the west and south.  I am a serious planner and had an entire itinerary worked out to see all the sites we could. We are spending so much money we have to do it all!!

Well, after 30 hours in Iceland I realized for us, that was an idiotic plan.  The revelation occured while having cake and coffee looking at the most stunning view in Hellnar. (IYKYK). We ""didn't have time"" to take the walk.  But wait, we have 22 hours of light and 7 days, of course we have time!!!! So what if a visit to a black church got cut?  Buy a postcard!

From that point on we had so much fun!! We hiked to formations at midnight, went to a pool every night before bed, explored Thingvellir at 4 am by ourselves for hours, ate supper on the beach watching the seals, tossed lots of rocks at beaches, lurked in caves watching the tourists, soaked for hours in the hot river, pulled off at the coolest random picnic stops, and took naps with the most breathtaking views! 

If you love an adventure taking pics and seeing all the things, have so much fun!! But, if you are the slow down sort just give yourself permission to have fun!  And eat the cake!!!!",44,1752754952.0,VisitingIceland,4,0.98,False

1188¬†WordsHello Lovely Readers,  
  
Thank you for taking the time to read A Baby for the Dragon. This book is a breeder kink one and has some talk of infertility with the main female lead, but will result in a pregnancy for our dragon and his mate. There will be tons of unprotected s\*x and lots of dirty talk, the s\*x will be super graphic and if that‚Äôs not something you enjoy, that‚Äôs okay. There are plenty of other books out there for you, just maybe not this one.   
  
This book will also contain some elements of b\*\*m, spanking, and a very heavy praise kink. Along with a very morally gray male lead and his step-brother who are both possessive and a bit obsessive about their woman.   
  
I do hope you enjoy Andreena, Spencer, and Adam‚Äôs story as much as I have enjoyed writing it and I look forward to writing more books for you to enjoy in the future.  
  
XOXO,  
  
Jane Knight  
  
Chapter One  
  
Andreena  
  
Pulling up to the small two story red brick house, I smiled tiredly. My sister‚Äôs little Chevy car was parked in the driveway beside Nolan‚Äôs truck. We hadn‚Äôt made plans to hang out, but I was excited to spend time with Bethany.  
  
It had been so long since we‚Äôd last hung out and just had some girl time. I missed my sister, I just hoped she wasn‚Äôt bothering my husband.  
  
He had a temper on him and lately that temper had been becoming harder and harder to deal with. His cutting remarks were harsher and the sting of his words would stay with me throughout the day.  
  
I knew that it was just the stress of everything that was going on. He had a big promotion coming up at work and we were trying to have a baby. I wanted that. I wanted to have a baby more than anything.  
  
It was like it burned inside of me, the need to settle down and have a little one. I hated that another month had come and gone with no positive sign on the pregnancy test, but I would be ovulating again in the next few days and we could try again.  
  
I knew this time something would stick. It had to. I was running out of hope and ready to start fertility treatments. Nolan wasn‚Äôt ready for that and I knew that he blamed me for not being pregnant. He had said as much just this morning before I had gone into work.  
  
It still stung, thinking about the cold indifference in his voice as we had our morning coffee together. ‚ÄúYou should be pregnant by now. I‚Äôve been trying to get you pregnant for the last year and your body just won‚Äôt work right.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm not the problem.‚Äù I had said, picking up my coffee cup and taking it over to the sink. Dumping out the sweet drink that tasted like ash on my tongue after his hurtful words.  
  
I was already blaming myself. I didn‚Äôt need him saying it too. I knew how he felt about my body, that he thought my weight was the problem.  
  
I wasn‚Äôt thin like my sister Bethany, it seemed like she had gotten all the good genes first and I was left with the rest. I was plus-sized and curvy with dark brown hair that never wanted to act right unless I had flat ironed it into submission.  
  
Parking my old Honda on the street, I flipped the mirror down. Checking my reflection in the cracked mirror, my hair was doing what it wanted so I reached for my bag and grabbed a hair tie. Pulling my hair into a bun before pulling the keys from the ignition and tucking them into my bag.  
  
I got out of my car and made my way up the paved driveway towards the front door of the house that Nolan and I shared. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it was ours or mine, really.  
  
I was the one who worked to pay the mortgage and it was a house that I could see myself starting a family in and building a life. I‚Äôd had so much hope for this little house when we had moved in, but with everything going on I was beginning to feel like that was never going to happen.  
  
Dragging my hand over my face, I let out a sigh before plastering on a fake smile. I was going to go in there and pretend that everything was great so Bethany wouldn‚Äôt worry about Nolan and I.  
  
I knew that she didn‚Äôt like him and that she thought that I should break up with him. But that felt like I was admitting defeat and even though we were struggling right now, I wasn‚Äôt willing to call it quits.  
  
Opening the door, I stepped inside. It was eerily quiet and there were no lights on. My first thought was that no one was home, but I had seen Nolan and Bethany‚Äôs vehicles so I knew that they were here.  
  
My sister was probably on her phone and Nolan was off doing what he did when he was trying to avoid me. Working out in our little home gym or hiding out in his office. I use that term loosely. It was an office, sure, but my husband used that office as a place to hide away from the world.  
  
I rested my hand on the wall, pulling one of my black heels off before doing the same with the other. I sat them neatly beside the door, next to running shoes and Nolan‚Äôs work shoes. I sat my purse beside them and turned to make my way down the hallway towards the living room.  
  
It was empty and dark. I was filled with a strange sense of foreboding as I walked towards the room, heading towards the stairs. My throat felt tight, but I didn‚Äôt understand why.  
  
The beige carpet was rough against my bare feet as I padded up the stairs. I stopped by Nolan‚Äôs office, pushing open the door and peeking in but the room was empty.  
  
A whimper sounded out from down the hallway and I felt my heart hammer in my chest. The door was cracked open and a sliver of light painted the pale carpet in the hallway.  
  
It felt like I wasn‚Äôt in control of my body as I made my way closer to the bedroom that I shared with my husband.  
  
Reaching out, I pushed the door open just a little bit, hoping that I was wrong. My sister wouldn‚Äôt sleep with my husband.  
  
She wouldn‚Äôt do that to me.  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right, you‚Äôre going to take it all. f\*\*k, you are so much better than Andreena. I‚Äôm going to come.‚Äù Nolan snarled. His hand was tight in my sister‚Äôs perfect blonde hair. His hips slapped against her bottom as she arched her back, f\*\*\*\*\*g herself back onto him.  
  
‚ÄúNolan, f\*\*k. Don‚Äôt stop, don‚Äôt ever f\*\*\*\*\*g stop.‚Äù She cried out her body going still as her face twisted up in pleasure.

I stood there watching them as they came. It felt like my world was shattering, but I couldn‚Äôt look away. How could Bethany sleep with Nolan?  
  
It was made all the worse when they fell to the bed and I could hear the sweet words that they were whispering to each other.  
  
‚ÄúBaby, I‚Äôm going to give you something that my sister never could.‚Äù Bethany said in her soft, breathy voice. The sounds of kissing followed. The sound was louder to me than when they had been f\*\*\*\*\*g. Or maybe I was just going into shock?  
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù Nolan asked.  
  
‚ÄúA baby. I‚Äôm pregnant with your baby.‚Äù  
  
My breath caught in my throat and I turned away from the open door, unable to take what I had just seen and heard. My sister had slept with my husband and this wasn‚Äôt the first time. It had been going on long enough for her to conceive a child with him.  
  
It felt like my heart was breaking from the betrayal of them. This wasn‚Äôt how things were supposed to be.  
  
I didn‚Äôt understand how Bethany could sleep with Nolan. She had listened to my cry and about not getting pregnant after months and months of trying. She had held my hand and comforted me when I had confided in her how my relationship with my husband was struggling.  
  
The entire time she had been sleeping with him and now she was having his baby. It was better this way; better for me to find out before he knocked me up and I was tied to him forever with a child.  
  
I made my way down the hallway, passing the framed photos of us from our wedding day. Our smiling faces pressed close together as he whispered words of love and promises of forever to me. My sister standing off to the side, beaming at the camera as she clutched her flowers to her breast.   
  
It felt like a lie now. Everything felt wrong. I felt numb, but I knew that I needed to get out of here. I didn‚Äôt want to face either one of them. Even though I knew that I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong, I just didn‚Äôt want to look into my sister‚Äôs eyes. I didn‚Äôt want to see her hating herself for sleeping with Nolan or, worse her hating me for what she had done.  
  
I wanted to rage, but I couldn‚Äôt find it in me to feel that way. Instead, I made my way down the hallway and then down the stairs like I was in a daze. Only stopping when I reached the front door to grab my purse and shoes.  
  
Quietly, I opened the door and slipped outside, being careful to close the door softly. The night air was cool against my skin and I breathed it in deeply before making my way to my car. The paved driveway felt good against my feet and I let out a long sigh.  
  
I‚Äôd spent all day working at the store and my body ached from being on my feet all day helping customers. It wasn‚Äôt that bad of a job and my boss, Glenda, was pretty awesome, but it was demanding due to the clientele that we had come in.  
  
That artist, Leonardo Philips and his wife regularly came into the store for him to buy her clothes now that she was pregnant and nothing fit. We also took care of a drummer for an upcoming band and his soon to be wife and several other high-profile customers who I wasn‚Äôt supposed to know about. Like the handsome red-headed man with gold eyes that reminded me of a bird of prey‚Äôs eyes. His partner had the prettiest gray eyes I had ever seen and when she smiled, it was like her whole face lit up.  
  
It was just some days were very demanding and today had been one of those days. We‚Äôd had so many orders to take care of that I‚Äôd had to work later than usual and then to come home to this.  
  
It just sucked.  
  
I opened the door to my can and climbed inside, being careful to not slam the door. Putting my keys into the ignition, I pulled out onto the road, not sure of where I was going but knowing that I couldn‚Äôt stay here.  
  
I drove aimlessly out of the suburbs until I found myself in the city. The bright lights were a sharp contrast to how I was feeling. Everything was cheery and that wasn‚Äôt what I needed right now. I just wanted to find someplace that was dark where I would blend in and could drink my sorrows away as I tried to figure out what I was going to do next.  
  
Reaching over to my bag, I dug around inside of it until I found my cell phone. I pulled up the web browser and tapped the screen. Searching for something in particular.  
  
When I found what I was looking for, I selected the address before entering it into my GPS. I drove through the crowded streets until the traffic thinned out and the street lamps were spaced out further apart, leaving plenty of dark places for people to hide in.  
  
This wasn‚Äôt the good part of town, but I didn‚Äôt care. Pulling up to the bar, I knew that it was exactly what I was looking for. The plain brick building had a red neon sign over the door. The bar‚Äôs name was brightly lit and it was slightly seedy. But it was just what I needed right now.  
  
‚ÄòThe Full Moon‚Äô sign flickered slightly as I pulled my car across the street into the small parking lot.  
  
I opened my door, slipping my shoes back on before grabbing my bag and slinging it over my shoulder as I stood up, closing the door to my car. I made my way across the street to the bar, my heels clicking loudly against the concrete sidewalk.  
  
The smell of old booze and cigarette smoke seemed to hang in the air like it was soaked into the brick and surrounding sidewalk. I didn‚Äôt let that bother me as I pushed open the door and stepped inside the darkened bar.

The bar was dark and the air was cool and smelled like cheap booze and the lingering hints of cigarettes. It wasn‚Äôt overwhelming, but I could still smell it beneath the other scents. I stepped inside the building, letting the heavy steel door close behind me. It let out a loud clang as it fell heavily closed, making me jump as I stood still, waiting for my eyes to adjust. When I could see clearly, I took in the room. It wasn‚Äôt a big bar, just a small hole in the wall place with rock music playing from the speakers that hung high on the dark painted walls.  
  
There was a small dance floor, but no one was dancing tonight. A few tables were setup and booths lined the far wall with a mirror reflection out towards the patrons.   
  
I took a step forward, almost falling, when I realized that there were several steps that led down towards the bar. I took them slowly, my heels clicking loudly on the concrete floor as I clutched the guard rail. My body was tired from the long day of work, but I was going to have a drink damn it.   
  
Making my way over to the bar, I looked at the shiny surface. It was painted a black that gleamed in the soft blue neon lights. There were a few men sitting at the bar nursing their drinks. They looked up at me as they approached and the lights cast an eerie skin on their skin, making them look otherworldly. Any other time, I would have been creeped out by their looks but tonight, I just didn‚Äôt have the energy for it.   
  
I wasn‚Äôt here for them, a good f\*\*k sounded like a great idea for another night when I didn‚Äôt feel so broken. I wanted to tuck myself into one of the booths at the back and drown my sorrows into a few glasses of cheap whiskey. It would be the cheap stuff tonight. I needed to put back as much money as I could towards a lawyer for handling my divorce.   
  
I never thought I would end up alone in a place like this. That I would be thinking about getting a divorce from the man that I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. Yet, here I was.  
  
Leaning over the bar, I flagged down the bartender. She brushed her long green hair over her shoulder before making her way over to me. She was pretty and her features were almost delicate. She had the kind of beauty about her that would make most women jealous. The soft blue light made her skin look like it glowed. Her honey-colored eyes met mine and she tilted her head to the side. Pressing her lips together in a thin line before she spoke.  
  
‚ÄúEvening honey, what can I get you?‚Äù Her voice was soft, but hard at the same time.   
  
I looked back to the bar, scanning the labels of the bottles that lined the shelf before l looked back at her. ‚ÄúA whiskey, neat.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll get that for you. Did you want to start a tab? You look like you could use a few tonight.‚Äù She said, biting the inside of her cheek as she smoothed her hands over the leather vest that she was wearing. There was nothing on underneath it and it showed off pale hints of her tattooed flesh. The artwork of a dragon hugging the moon was inked into her shoulder and the top of her arm. It was so detailed that it looked almost real.   
  
I watched as she turned away from me, grabbing one of the bottles of amber colored liquid. She turned around, pulling out a tumbler and setting it onto the bar. She poured the alcohol into the glass before pushing the glass towards me with two fingers.   
  
‚ÄúYeah, I need more than a few.‚Äù I said, picking up the whisky and taking a sip. Grimacing at the taste as it burned its way down my throat.   
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll set that up for you.‚Äù She said before looking at the men that sat at the bar. ‚ÄúIf anyone gives you any trouble, let me know. We don‚Äôt get many like you here.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúUm, oh, okay.‚Äù I stuttered, unsure of what she meant. One of the men sitting at the bar shot me a toothy grin, but that wasn‚Äôt what worried me. No, it was the way his eyes seemed to grow darker than they should.   
  
It had to be a trick of the lighting or maybe I was just more tired than I thought and my mind was the one playing tricks on me. That had to be it, peoples eyes didn‚Äôt turn black like that.   
  
I walked over to the last booth, slipping onto the red leather seat and scooting against the wall. I took a sip of my drink before setting it down on the dark, polished wooden table. Names were etched into the top of it, but I didn‚Äôt take the time to read them as I traced my fingers over the imperfections. Some of the names were couples with hearts and plus signs linking their names together.   
  
My throat felt tight. I was going to be alone. More alone than I had ever been before. I was going to have to divorce my husband, the man that I had wanted to start a family with. The mad that I had promised to stand by in sickness and in health.   
  
The man that had slept with my sister.   
  
My sister, who I didn‚Äôt want to see again, who was pregnant with my husband‚Äôs baby. Her sleeping with Nolan hurt. It hurt worse than knowing he had cheated on me. He could have had anyone, why did he have to sleep with Bethany? How could she do this to me?  
  
If someone had told me this morning that I would be at a bar drinking alone while my husband and my sister celebrated her pregnancy. I would have laughed at them like they were crazy and told them that neither of them would do that to me.   
  
But now I knew the truth. That they would hurt me like that, that they‚Äôd been together for a while now and she was doing something that I hadn‚Äôt been able to in all the months that we had been trying.   
  
My sister was going to have Nolan‚Äôs baby.   
  
My eyes started to burn as tears pricked at them. I was so stupid to think that they loved me, that they wanted the best for me like I had wanted for them. I closed my eyes, feeling a tear slip down my cheek. Reaching up, I scrubbed that tear away and opened my eyes. Blinking rapidly, I wasn‚Äôt going to cry over them.   
  
I wouldn‚Äôt do it. Things would get better for me, they had to. I couldn‚Äôt keep going on the way that I was. Tonight, I‚Äôd sleep in my car, then head into work. Hopefully, Glinda wouldn‚Äôt mind if I used my free time at the shop to call around to find an inexpensive divorce attorney so that I could get this taken care of and over with as soon as possible.   
  
I wanted to be back in my home, but I didn‚Äôt want to be there with Nolan and Bethany. I never wanted to see my husband ever again and I was slowly getting angrier at my sister. That pain was turning into something darker that made me want her to hurt just like I was.   
  
Picking up my drink, I tossed it back. Deciding that I would get one more when I noticed a man was standing outside of the booth watching me closely. He was wearing a suit and looked oddly out of place here.  
  
I looked up at him and swallowed hard at the look in his deep blue eyes.

\*\*\*Spencer POV\*\*\*  
  
I parked my SUV into the parking lot of Full Moon. It was one of the few businesses that I owned in the city that my family didn‚Äôt know about. They knew that it was shifter run, but they hadn‚Äôt realized that it was mine. It was the perfect place for me to sort through my father‚Äôs orders to my brother and I. I needed to find a mate; it didn‚Äôt have to be a mate that I was in love with.   
  
Love was for fools and I was no fool. Finding a mate that you loved made you weak. I had seen it too many times and I refused to weaken myself like that.   
  
Letting out a sigh as I pulled the keys from the ignition and rested my forehead on the steering wheel. This f\*\*\*\*\*g day had been long and now I just wanted to have a few drinks and maybe find someone to warm my bed so that I could work off my tension before heading back to my house and sleeping it all off. Then I could get started on finding a mate tomorrow, just someone to make my father happy enough to hand over his title to me.   
  
My father had met up with my brother and I to discuss the future of our thrall. The old dragon was coming to the age where he knew his end would be soon and even though I hated the bastard, I didn‚Äôt want what he was asking of my brother and I.  
  
I didn‚Äôt want a mate. I could run the thrall without one, it wouldn‚Äôt help me like he thought it would. Love was for the weak and I wasn‚Äôt weak. Yet, my father wanted me to find my mate. He wasn‚Äôt willing to hand over the thrall to me or my brother unless we had found our mate. He wanted us to claim them and breed with them, securing things for the future of our thrall before he was willing to hand over his title to one of us.   
  
So whether I liked it or not, I was going to have to find my mate. It didn‚Äôt matter to me if it was my fated mate or not. I knew that this was a bad idea. That I didn‚Äôt want a mate, but I would need one for this. I couldn‚Äôt let my brother take over the thrall.   
  
He was too young and didn‚Äôt think things through. It would only end up bringing about destruction to our thrall. There weren‚Äôt enough dragons around anymore for that. If our thrall dissolved, it would bring the Elder‚Äôs council down on us and I didn‚Äôt want that. No one wanted Vega and her consorts to come to our territory and split it up between other thralls, flocks, and packs.   
  
Vega was doing better than her father had and several thralls were flourishing, but we weren‚Äôt one of them. No, my father had been loyal to the previous head of the council and he had yet to submit to Adner‚Äôs daughter Vega. I couldn‚Äôt say that I blamed him, it was hard to bow to someone like her.   
  
I‚Äôd heard rumors that Marcus Blackwell and his half dragon mate had been the one to take down the old dragon. I didn‚Äôt know if that was true, but it would make it hard for any of us to accept the newest Elder. I myself didn‚Äôt want to submit to her either, but I was willing to do it if I were the head of our thrall just to make sure that my people were safe.   
  
My brother was like our father. He wouldn‚Äôt bend and he was too brash and young to take over as the Tarak of the thrall. I couldn‚Äôt let that happen to my family. That‚Äôs what the thrall was. I wouldn‚Äôt let it be destroyed by the whims of a child. He was likely to mate everyone off just so that he could be free to do as he pleased. It would be the same things with the thrall‚Äôs business holdings. Everything split up and divided.  
  
At least, Full Moon was something that he couldn‚Äôt touch. I‚Äôd hired a pretty little wolf shifter to manage the place and Cristina did a good job of that. She might look like a slip of a woman with her bright blue and green hair and her deep amber eyes, but she was just as fierce as a dragon when it came to taking care of what she considered hers.   
  
And Cristina considered Full Moon hers just as much as anything else that she owned. I‚Äôd helped the rogue wolf out, giving her a place above the bar to stay while she sorted out things with her previous pack and even though she wasn‚Äôt part of my thrall, I knew that she thought of me as her alpha.

She might work as an acceptable mate for me. I would have to bring it up with her, but I knew how strongly wolves felt about finding their fated mates. Mating for the sake of my thrall, no matter how much she felt she owed me might be more than she was willing to do.   
  
I couldn‚Äôt fault her for that, no matter how much easier it would make things for me. Sitting up straight, I smoothed my hands down the front of my charcoal colored suit jacket before opening the door and stepping out into the chilly night. It was a biting chill, but I breathed it in, letting the cold chase away my previous worries.   
  
Closing the door to my SUV, I pressed the button on the key fob. The alarm sounded out with one loud beep as it armed itself. No one would mess with my vehicle. Most everyone here knew who I was and the fear that my family invoked. But I wasn‚Äôt willing to take the chance.   
  
I tucked my keys into my suit pocket, strolling down the paved sidewalk towards the bar. The moon hung full and heavy above me and I could feel the whispers of its magical pull tugging at my skin. A sweet scent hung in the air but it was fading. The scent was familiar but I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it.   
  
My mouth watered and I felt my teeth grow sharp. The pull of the moon was intense tonight. A lesser dragon would be holed up in their lair with their mates, trying to help them through their heat and breed them. Yet, I was out here trying to do what needed to be done by meeting with my father.   
  
Maybe in another life, I would have been holed up in a lair with a mate. Helping her through the heat that the moon sent all those fated to dragons went into.   
  
This life, though, it was a hard one. I had never had the urge to take a mate or to pass on my seed to make an heir. It had made me feel like I was broken when I was younger and I would hear of others finding their mates and the hopes they had of starting a family. When my mother was alive and I had told her my feelings on it, she had told me it would be different when I found my fated mate.   
  
That meeting them would change how I felt, that it would bring out that primal need in me to claim them and breed them until they were full of my seed. Their belly swollen with an heir to care on my dragon‚Äôs line.   
  
That didn‚Äôt seem right to me. Sure, I liked f\*\*\*\*\*g, loved it even but the idea of knocking someone up... Of having a bunch of little spawn running around with my temper didn‚Äôt sound like much fun to deal with and wasn‚Äôt anything I was in a rush to do. Maybe that‚Äôs why I hadn‚Äôt found my mate yet?  
  
That the moon goddess knew I was broken, so she hadn‚Äôt fated anyone to be stuck with me. It was for the best really. If I had a fated mate I worried that it would make me weak. A chosen mate was the right way to go for me. Now, I just needed to find someone to claim, then I could f\*\*k them and take my title as Tarak of my thrall.   
  
We didn‚Äôt have to love each other. Hell, we didn‚Äôt have to even like each other. Once she was claimed and I was in my seat as leader, I would make sure that she knew she was free to do as she pleased. I wouldn‚Äôt make her stay. I would find a way to break that bond that we would share. Then I could rule the thrall on my own, not weakened by being tied to another.  
  
My dragon snarled in my head at the thought of me taking a mate and rejecting them. He was like any other beast, ready to settle down with a mate. Even though I hadn‚Äôt taken a mate, he didn‚Äôt like the idea of breaking that bond.   
  
Rolling the tension out of my shoulders, I pushed open the steel door to Full Moon and stepped inside. The scent of wolves hit me first, a woodsy smell that they all had. That with the sharp scent of oranges and spiced tea, the scent of Cristina. The scent relaxed me, but there was another scent there. One that coiled in my head, whispering sweet promises and desires that I wasn‚Äôt even aware that I‚Äôd had.   
  
It was a dangerous scent and I felt my teeth grow to sharp, fang-like points. Salvia filled my mouth in anticipation of tasting the one who smelled like raspberries with warm hints of heavy cream. The room around me grew clearer as my vision sharpened and I knew that my eyes would be almost glowing, my skin rippled with dragon scales.   
  
The beast roared in my head, chasing away the low rock music that played around me. He was trying to come to the surface to take control from me and find her.  
  
Mate  
  
I closed my eyes, trying to bring my dragon back to heel. I couldn‚Äôt think with him beating against my skin like this and if I couldn‚Äôt think. That could be dangerous. I was going to need to kill whoever it was that smelled like this.   
  
A mate would make me weak.   
  
Yet, even thinking about killing her had my beast roaring louder. I fisted my hands at my sides. My sharp nails dug into my palm and I felt the sting of pain. It helped to clear my head and I took a slow, shuddering breath, opening my eyes. I looked around the bar, Cristina was watching me from behind the bar. Her delicate face twisted up with worry as she dragged a cloth over the bar top.   
  
There were a few wolves sitting at the bad but none that I recognized. I looked around the room, my eyes landing on a woman with long, dark brown hair. Her face was turned down to her drink, but even the side profile of her was beautiful. She wasn‚Äôt pale like the moon, her skin was tanned, her nose was slightly upturned but I could see her full fuckable lips.   
  


# Chapter6

1134¬†WordsThose lips would look so good wrapped around my c\*\*k that I felt my d\*\*k stir to life. Mascara ran down her cheeks, but it didn‚Äôt take away from her good looks. If anything, it seemed to add to her beauty, making me think of what she would look like with that makeup running down her face as she looked up at me from her knees. Her lips swollen from taking my c\*\*k until she gagged on it.   
  
Her hands bound behind her back and that long dark hair curving her breasts, but not able to hide the rest of her naked skin from me.   
  
I wanted her more than I‚Äôd ever wanted anyone I had ever seen before. My beast wanted her and I knew that it was dangerous to want her this much. It was like my body burned for her. I walked over to the booth that she was sitting in. The sharp scent of salt hung around her, mixing with her sweet berry-like scent.  
  
My mate was crying and I didn‚Äôt like it. My beast screamed for the blood of the person that had caused those tears. She should never cry like this.   
  
She picked up her drink, tossing it back before turning towards me. Her deep brown eyes going wide as she looked up at me.   
  
‚ÄúWho made you cry?‚Äù I asked, trying to keep the growl out of my voice. It wouldn‚Äôt do to scare her off, now that both my beast and I had seen her. She was a weakness that I wasn‚Äôt prepared to want. But I needed to know who had hurt my mate enough for her sadness to color her scent.   
  
I wanted to keep her, to take her to my lair and hide her away so that nothing could ever hurt her. The other part of me, the darker part wanted to f\*\*k her and kill her so she wouldn‚Äôt make me weak.   
  
I was so f\*\*\*\*d.   
  
\*\*\*Andreena POV\*\*\*  
  
‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù I asked the handsome stranger that was standing outside of the booth I was sitting in. I‚Äôd had a moment where I couldn‚Äôt help but cry as everything that had happened this evening hit me with a full force.   
  
‚ÄúWho made you cry?‚Äù He repeated slower this time and I tilted my head to the side, studying him closely. He was tall, his blonde hair was brushed neatly back from his handsome face. Those sharp cheekbones would have been something that a model would have killed for. His cheeks were almost hallowed and there was a gauntness to him that made him almost look hungry. It didn‚Äôt take away from the heat that burned in his eyes as he looked down at me.   
  
‚ÄúDoes that line work for you most of the time?‚Äù I asked, swallowing hard as I scrubbed the tears out of my eyes with my fist. I caught the slight twitch of the muscles in his jaw as his eyes seemed to almost glow in the neon lights of the bar.   
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a line.‚Äù He growled, pressing his lips together before slipping into the booth across from me. ‚ÄúWhy are you crying?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs been a really rough day.‚Äù I said, looking down at my empty glass. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have it in me for this.‚Äù I motioned between the two of us.  
  
Mr. Tall, blonde and handsome lifted an eyebrow at me. ‚ÄúThis?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I said, scooting to the edge of the seat so I could slip out of the booth. I didn‚Äôt want to leave to find another dive bar to drown my sorrows in, but I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to talk to anyone. No matter how handsome they were or the way that he had asked who did this to me like he was some type of character in a romance book.   
  
Maybe before Nolan that kind of thing would have worked on me, but I was jaded now. My heart had been ripped out and crushed. I didn‚Äôt have it in me to deal with this man tonight.  
  
‚ÄúHow about I buy you a drink and you can tell me about it?‚Äù He asked, looking at my glass before motioning over towards the bartender.   
  
I shifted in my seat, looking over at the pretty woman behind the bar. She reached back behind her, grabbing a bottle of whiskey from the top shelf and a tumbler before stepping around the bar. Her eyes were locked on the man in front of me, like he was someone that she listened to.   
  
What was it about this man that made her feel this way? Was he a regular or maybe a friend of hers?   
  
Maybe that‚Äôs why he had chosen to sit with me tonight? Had I stolen his favorite booth and now he was going to grill me about it?  
  
‚ÄúHere you go, boss.‚Äù The woman with green hair said, sitting the tumbler down. She stood tall as she poured him two fingers worth of the amber colored liquid.   
  
‚ÄúThank you, Cristina.‚Äù He said, dipping his head towards her.   
  
Cristina went to refill my glass and he stopped her, taking the bottle from her before waving her away. He poured some of the liquor into my glass before setting the bottle between us.   
  
‚ÄúI hate to drink alone after a long day.‚Äù He said, picking up the crystal tumbler and looking at the lights play off the liquid before he took a long sip. When he noticed I hadn‚Äôt taken a drink, he frowned. ‚ÄúI could have Cristina bring over something else if you‚Äôd like.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBoss?‚Äù I asked, looking over at the bar before looking back at him.   
  
‚ÄúYes, this bar is mine.‚Äù He drawled out slowly.  
  
‚ÄúNeat.‚Äù I said, not sure what I was supposed to say to that. I wouldn‚Äôt have pictured him owning a sleazy bar like this, well I mean it was a dive bar from outside but inside it wasn‚Äôt too bad.  
  
Was this guy some sort of mafia man? He was in a dark charcoal gray suit that was immaculately tailored to fit his lean physique.   
  
Glinda would have swooned if he had come into the shop. My boss had an eye for designer clothing and there was no doubt in my mind that this man had paid more than I made in a week for that suit. The small silver buttons gleamed in the lights and I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder how they would feel beneath my fingertips as I helped him unbutton his jacket before sliding it off of his broad shoulders.

Damn, what was wrong with me? I shouldn‚Äôt be thinking about this guy like that. I‚Äôd just had my hopes and dreams crushed by my husband and my sister. I didn‚Äôt need to be looking at this man. It was a bad decision but it was nice to have someone like him look at me.   
  
He finished off his drink before pouring another and I picked up the tumbler that sat in front of me. ‚ÄúNo, this is fine. But I can‚Äôt stay for long. My, uh, my friend is waiting for me.‚Äù I took a sip, looking away from the intense gaze that he had pinned me with.   
  
I almost felt guilty lying to him, but for all I knew he was some sort of serial killer and wanted me to be his next victim. Which, in all honesty, would have been the icing on the cake of the shitty day I‚Äôd been having.   
  
He didn‚Äôt say anything, but I had the feeling from the way he looked at me. With his lips ghosting into a smile that I would have missed if I weren‚Äôt paying attention, he knew that I was lying. I didn‚Äôt know how he knew, but I had a gut feeling that I couldn‚Äôt lie to this man.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Spencer.‚Äù He said, picking up the tumbler and leaning back in his seat as he watched me.   
  
‚ÄúAndreena.‚Äù I answered him, taking another long pull from my drink. It burned but it helped me loosen up.   
  
‚ÄúAndreena, it‚Äôs been a long day. Why don‚Äôt you tell me your problems and I‚Äôll tell you mine? We can keep each other company for the evening, I hate to drink alone.‚Äù His gaze flicked down to my lips and I sucked in a breath at the look in his eyes. It was like he actually cared what I was going to say.   
  
It had been so long since anyone had cared to hear what I had to say that I felt something rise in my chest. A feeling that I hadn‚Äôt felt in so long. I felt wanted and seen.  
  
I knew at that moment I was going to stay here and talk to him. It didn‚Äôt matter for how long, maybe we would finish off the bottle but I knew we both needed someone to hear us.   
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to drink alone either, but it‚Äôs nothing more than that.‚Äù I said, lifting the tumble to my lips and taking a sip. I reached over to grab the bottle and he pushed my hand away. Sparks moved over my skin at his touch and I frowned. Pulling my hand away from his as if his touch had burned me.   
  
Looking down at my fingers, I stretched them. Was the alcohol having a weird effect on me? I‚Äôd never had that reaction before when drinking, but maybe the liquor was stronger than I was used to. It wasn‚Äôt cheap, sweet wine that my sister and I liked to drink when she would come over to hang out.   
  
‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be more than that. Just a few drinks.‚Äù Spencer said, pouring more of the whiskey into my glass. He was careful, not looking at me as he watched the tumbler. He filled it up more than I was used to before sitting the bottle down and sliding the glass towards me.   
  
‚ÄúI walked in on my husband and my sister f\*\*\*\*\*g. They, they are, she‚Äôs pregnant.‚Äù I looked down, not saying anything. I was afraid that if I did, I would start to cry again.   
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs f\*\*\*\*d up.‚Äù He said, finally looking up at me. ‚ÄúMy father wants me to settle down and get married.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs a trap. It‚Äôll just leave you feeling broken after you have given it everything you had to try to make it work. I‚Äôm just glad I was never able to, that we didn‚Äôt have any children-‚Äú I bit my lower lip, feeling my eyes burn. The words hanging in my throat making me feel like I was a failure. Maybe if we hadn‚Äôt been struggling to conceive Nolan wouldn‚Äôt have slept with my sister?  
  
Maybe I wouldn‚Äôt be here feeling like I was the problem when I wasn‚Äôt the one who cheated.  
  
Damn it, I didn‚Äôt want to cry right now. I had just met Spencer. He didn‚Äôt need me to get all weepy around him. It was stupid that I felt so hurt and that the only person who seemed to care was this handsome stranger sitting across from me.   
  
‚ÄúIs that what happened to you?‚Äù Spencer asked, taking another sip of his drink before he sat it down onto the table. ‚ÄúDid catching them together break you?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I reached out, picking up my drink and taking a sip. The alcohol was starting to get to me and I knew that this was going to have to be the last one for me. If it wasn‚Äôt, I might end up doing something stupid, like calling Nolan or texting my sister. ‚ÄúI think what hurts worse is that they were in my home. Our bed, it just all sucks and I can‚Äôt stop feeling like it‚Äôs my fault.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt deserve you. No one should do that to the one they love.‚Äù There was something in the way that he said those words. A fierceness that pulled me out of my pity party and made me look up at him. His pale eyes seemed to grow brighter and if I didn‚Äôt know any better, I could have sworn that I had seen sharp, fang-like teeth in his smile.   
  
‚ÄúThey shouldn‚Äôt, but sometimes it happens. I‚Äôm sorry for spilling all of my problems onto you.‚Äù I looked at his hand that he had wrapped around his glass. His nails were well manicured and short, but they looked shiny in the lights of the bar almost like he had spent time buffing them out so they gleamed. It reminded me of the hands of the men that came into the shop. Not like Leonardo‚Äôs hands, he had hands that were scarred from flames and countless hours working with heated poles in his studio.   
  
No, these were the hands of a man that was in control. Of a man that took what he wanted without a thought or care to what anyone else thought about it. ",1,1752754900.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm so angry about the way we live our lives now. Everything is fake and for attention. People don‚Äôt have hobbies because they spend hours scrolling on their phone. We only bother to take photos to share them with other people. I hate it

Quick note - no judgement meaning to come across here. One of the things I hate the most is that I have all these strong feelings yet can‚Äôt delete insta for the life of me. I also think it‚Äôs not an individuals issue, but the issue with capitalism and the lack of regulation when teens like me first starts using social media. Also there are positives to it like keeping in touch with old friends, fundraising etc etc - no hate meant to anyone!

I feel like everything everyone I know does is because of social media. Whether you‚Äôre getting a coffee, wearing a certain outfit, surprising a long distance family member, all just feels like we are doing it to show people we‚Äôve done it. 

So many people I know just don‚Äôt have interests. Idk if it‚Äôs a generation thing or what but it genuinely feels like they can‚Äôt have a proper good convo.

And don‚Äôt get me started on the whole ‚Äòinsta face‚Äô theory!!

Plus, the stats around it are insane. Social media has been proven to (I will find sources if interest) literally make teens mental health worse dramatically, increase loneliness and generally contribute to lower dopamine levels. So WHY are we glorifying influencers and social media as a legitimate career so much??

Is it just me?? Maybe I need a nap lol but it just makes me actively angry thinking about how my parents experienced their 20s actually enjoying LIFE and how from my pov it seems that the whole world exists inside this littler digital box ",4,1752754778.0,TrueOffMyChest,10,0.84,False

* I am using medium-roasted coffee beans.
* I'm using the manual way of pulling the shot (ie long press button to preinfuse, unpress to full pump, press again to stop)
* I use 18g of espresso. When tapped in, i check with the razor and from a volumetric point of view the puck is fine.
* With grind size:
   * < 18 the machine chokes and I dont get anything
   * At 18, I barely get around 20-25 g at 30-40 seconds
   * at 19 I get \~36g in 40''
   * at 20 it's too watery, I get 1:3 in <30''

My problems are:

1. My coffee is not *that* dark to need such a coarse setting. Baratza suggest 16 for espresso. If I want to grind something dark, I'll need to go into filter coffee grind settings.
2. More importantly, it gives very little room for experimentation/error. Normally, even 1 setting coarser/finer should make the cup undrinkable.
3. The shot is *fine* at 19, but since I drink this coffee often at my coffee shop, I know it's not at its best. However, with the grinder settings being so limited, I don't know how else I can experiment.

I have yo-yo dieted my whole life. My average weight since 15 is 200lbs and ever since I‚Äôve lost and gained back about 25-30lbs each time. Most recently though I went through a health scare (OBGYN related) and broke my leg last year requiring surgery. I gained about 40 pounds last year from those health issues. Since May I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight. Aside from my birthday and a grad celebration in June I‚Äôve been very good. Starting weight at 243lbs. I eat about 1,100 cals a day. It‚Äôs mid July and I am only down to 238lbs. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG? 
For context here is what I eat during the week on avg: M-F: a medium coffee with sugar free creamer(130cals). Maybe 2x out of the week I will have sausage and egg wake up wrap (290cals). For lunch I have an Atkins chocolate PB protein bar (240cals if I even eat the whole thing). I sometimes have an applesauce for snack (90cals) and for dinner I have a high protein healthy choice meal (280-380cals). Maybe 2x a week I‚Äôll have a sugar free popsicle for like 30cals. 
On Saturday I splurge a little and might have like 2,000 cals. On Sunday back to only 1,100 calories. 
I don‚Äôt drink much but might have a white claw or 2 on a Saturday. 
Unfortunately I have to sit at a computer desk for work. I go for walks maybe like 15 min a day and a little extra on the weekends.
