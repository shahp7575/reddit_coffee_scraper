1ofgtjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ofgtjx/aitah_for_refusing_a_conversation_during_friend/,AITAH for refusing a conversation during friend break up?,"Ex-friend (28F) and I (27F) met two and a half years ago during our masters program. We grown close the past year and a half, where I have felt I held many roles for her. I am not a huge texter, phone caller, and am not the type to go to friends often to confide/vent until I’ve processed situation. She is someone who likes texting, calling, and hanging out any chance she can get.

But now I am in a PhD program, second year in, and she’s working a FT job after another masters. She moved to the next city over, a 50 min commute for me on public transit (neither of us have cars). I’m stressed, exhausted, anxious. The calls before I head to lab, during lab, late at night have added to my stress and my advice is not always what she wants to hear. 

In the past two months, she had a mental health crisis and her first big event she hosted/planned. During the mental health crisis, I reached out to mutual while debating on what to do because it was unexpectedly triggering for me, having lived in an unstable household.  One other and myself went to her apartment to check on her, and I stayed for several hours until 2 am. 

I attended her event, we took pictures after. This event caused her a lot of stress and was a lot of what our phone calls were about. Then, a week later, after asking if we’re on good terms because I noticed she tried following me on social media (at that point I didn’t know she unfollowed), she texted me saying she felt our friendship wasn’t solid, and she’d be happy to chat over coffee if id like.

I refused coffee, suggesting text or phone call—-I’ve seen this pattern from her before with the friends she dropped over the years. My response led to a phone call where she asked me what I meant when I communicated I was “frustrated, disappointed, and upset”. After telling her I’ve felt isolated for some time and knowing her unfollowing being significant to her (when she wants space or wants nothing to do with someone), she admitted she wasn’t planning having a conversation because I’m hard to talk to and was just going to ghost me.

We started to get into it, where she said I never show up and that me asking if we’re were on good terms made her consider trying again in our friendship. I told her I was surprised to hear that and that I didn’t like that she wasn’t planning on talking to me about this. She stopped the convo saying “I’m at work” (I, too, was at work) and she just called because of my text. She asked to put a pin in it and have a convo later. This was when I told her that I don’t think I want to have a conversation at all, in person or on the phone.

She got mad, saying I wasn’t trying and hung up.

AITAH for shutting down a conversation? Should I have allowed a space for us to talk?

TLDR: My ex-friend admitted she planned to phase out of my life instead of having a conversation with me. It wasn’t until I asked if we were on good terms, a week after I attended a special event hosted by her and weeks after supporting her through mental health crisis, that she felt it was worth trying in our friendship again. Her concern was that I never show up. I decided after a brief convo where this was all shared, that I didn’t not want to have a conversation about this/our friendship.

(What kind of routine?) ?,"I usually worked late but that got me burnt out so now I’m trying to be in bed by 12am so I can get up at 8am (college student). So I turned my time of 9pm-12am be my “me time” (as long as there is nothing that is due that night). I love listening to music and imagining little stories in my head before bed, but wasn’t falling asleep. I tried cat videos but that didn’t help. I tried writing out the stories before bed, didnt help me fall asleep because it was “exciting” as well, I try reading, but my paperbacks are super interesting and I don’t want to put it down, fanfic has me kicking my feet, and my economics books activate my mind (it’s my major and I study it all day so it ‘wakes’ my brain up). At this point I’m thinking I should either just stay up and work and be miserable for the rest of the semester, or do something enjoyable like listening to music, but just have less working hours and less stuff done, so I also feel miserable. I don’t like either option. What’s a routine to help me fall asleep. I don’t drink coffee late, or have sugary late night snacks, nor late meals. I don’t hit the gym everyday but I make sure to get some push-ups and leg lifts in at least once a day. I drink a lot of water. Lights get turned off at 12am at the latest (I try to have them off before then but I have a roommate). I don’t nap during the day (at all, I couldn’t fall asleep if I tried). I honestly don’t know what to do because I just get frustrated at myself for being lazy. I don’t like falling asleep or the idea of being asleep or waking up from sleep.

1ofgrcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1ofgrcq/type_me/,Type me,"What am I?

I have known about MBTI for 5 years, and have really only studied Jungian’s ideas for one year. I have always struggled to get a grasp on what MBTI I could be, and even my friend who knows about psychology struggled to type me.

I have debated between the four INXX types (infj intj infp intp) for so long, and I need a bit more clarity so I can start to conclude what my type is.


I am someone who:
- gets nervous when texting someone something either emotionally or mentally vulnerable; I compensate by always leaving my do not disturb on, and when it’s off, I get nervous checking messages
- does not like picking up phone calls 
- talks to oneself
- not afraid with being loud or oversharing in front of family and friends 
- a bit clumsy sometimes as a result of being in my own head 
- when talking with people, I tend to place focus on just me and them, which leads me to ignore surroundings
- gets annoyed when people speak about trivial and surface level stuff, only if it’s not something we both share in common and that can lead to an engaging conversation. 
- likes new things, but will stick with old things until I get the full value out of them (I listen to the same album non-stop for years at a time) 
- likes when things are clean but doesn’t like to put too much effort into cleaning it, will maintain the clean environment though
- loves music and expressing myself fearlessly, singing songs with people I know very well but not with people I’m not so well acquainted with
- hates when people are overly competitive because it unintentionally spreads to me & stresses me out
- likes the little things in life because they make the present life less dreadful (iced coffee in the mornings)
- if a schedule is made for a conference, concert, or any event and it is not followed, I get annoyed and impatient
- lives heavily in the future and often fantasizes about the coming weeks so I can get through my day
- uses my ambition of having a 6 year plan for the future as a drive to do better in life now, without it I would never try as hard.
-would rather have 4 close friends than 30 surface level friends
- doesn’t like high maintenance friendships
- only does things when I’m ready if it’s a big deal, and if I don’t have a time to decide, I’ll freeze
- has strong values, but also the type to read comments on a TikTok before making an internal decision on whether it’s funny or not
- procrastinates doing easy things that are boring and tedious rather than hard things that are engaging and interesting 
- if something is to get to be done, I will get it done IF there are no external factors pressuring me — there’s nothing more I hate than unrealistic deadlines
- long hours spent thinking about myself deeply and what I am to my core
-has struggled for years with my MBTI, since I’m someone who tends to see things very black and white, and I tend to resonate with all the functions
- hate when people disagree with my morals and values, but I try to bite my tongue and not argue too much
- just cares about the result — don’t tell me how you got there
- gets impatient with obstacles that feel unnecessary or slow things down
- does not plan outfits for everyday 
- makes to do lists on the notes app and forgets about them immediately after, but still gets things done — I hate overly complicated apps for productivity
-get jealous when other people are prettier, smarter, or are unfairly given better opportunities than me BUT forces the envy to pass by distracting myself with other things
- will forget an appointment if I don’t put it in my schedule and set seven alarms to remind me, but otherwise, I am always half an hour early and never miss it
- cannot be a housewife, I need a purpose and I need to be someone making an impact in my everyday life (even though I want kids)
- not focused on the way I look externally to an EXTENT. (less than my ESFP brother and ESTP sister, but I still put in effort for myself)
- under stress, I can become hyper-focused on minor face blemishes or small physical inconsistencies, and it comes in outbursts
- Ideal world: I will have freedom/autonomy, financial abundance, and I will have also made a meaningful impact in the world (find a cure for something or develop something meaningful)

I am confused because I don’t know if I’m Fi-Te or Ti-Fe. I am also just unsure whether I employ Ne or Ni.

Hala! Si OA 😅 but at this age, I’m longing for something real, a genuine connection that feels safe, steady, and full of warmth.

I want a partner who’s not afraid to show up, to grow together, to share the small moments and big adventures, someone who values presence, effort, and sincerity. Life is too short for half-hearted connections, right? So here I am, taking a chance. Maybe you’re here too. 

About Me

Looks: Fair-skinned, 5’4”, curvy, and I take pride in presenting myself well, especially when there’s an occasion or gala. I carry myself with confidence and grace.

Personality: I’m brave, I stand up for what’s right, and I don’t tolerate disrespect. You can count on me to be your defender (hero yarn?). A bit shy at first, but once I’m comfortable, I’m warm, talkative, and playful. I’m affectionate, a little pang-aasar sometimes, my way of showing lambing. I deeply value quality time, genuine effort, and thoughtful communication.

Hobbies: I love jogging and joining fun runs. I enjoy watching movies or series (though medyo busy lately). I like discovering new coffee shops, kahit acidic ako haha so ikaw na sa coffee, ako sa pastries! I used to write novels and short stories, hoping to find time again or explore a new creative hobby soon.

Other Info

Career: Licensed medical professional
Political Stand: Proud Kakampink, still firm in standing for what’s right.
Car: Not yet, but planning to get one soon (open to driving lessons… baka ikaw pa magturo hihi)
Can host: Not at the moment, but I’m always up for travel and new experiences.

What I’m Looking For

Emotionally intelligent (please lang)

Knows how to treat people with respect and kindness, especially your woman. I’m independent and can handle my own, but it’s nice to feel cherished too.

Sweet in your own way, thoughtful without being performative.

Has a provider mindset, not because I need it, but because it shows maturity and initiative. (And yes, I always offer to share, no need for reminders)

Confident, goal-oriented, and grounded.

Well-groomed, presentable, and cutieee.

Date Ideas (Wow! May listahan siya)

-Travel and explore new places
-Coffee or restaurant hopping 
-Hiking or camping
-Pottery or baking class
-Maybe even a dance class (kahit parehong kaliwang paa tayo 😆)
I’m open to trying new things together, the goal is to make memories.

Please Don’t Message If

You’re a ghoster. We’re adults, honesty is always better.

You only send one-word replies. Communication matters.

You’re just looking for fun. I’m here for something real, built on trust, effort, and time.

1ofgli2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ofgli2/how_agentic_ui_helped_us_win_our_first_paying/,How Agentic UI Helped Us Win Our First Paying Users. I will not promote,"I want to tell you about a recent MVP build. It started as a regular dashboard with sidebar, multiple buttons, context menus, summary cards, charts... the boring stuff. Seeing the AI-browser trend made something click, and we decided to go on a totally different direction (for the better). That decision turned out to be a great way to win our first paying users.

So, we started this build with a sidebar based dashboard. Nothing impactful. If felt just like every other SEO tool in the market.

Let's be honest:

**Users DON'T WANT to learn a whole new dashboard.**

Imagine waking up and thinking:

*""Great, I get to spend the whole morning navigating menus and features to figure out this new product.""*

It's less cruel to put sugar in your coffee.

And at least that doesn't come with a stripe paywall.

With AI-browsers becoming the norm, no one has the time or energy for complex interfaces.

And in today's fast moving environment, you worry about users abandoning your idea, or competitors getting ahead.

So, as much as I hate rework. We had no choice.

We rebuilt the entire frontend.

And yes, we vibe-coded some of it (I know...).

Don't worry, we used safety guards to move faster without risking it looking unpolished to early adopters. (or worse, investors)

Here’s what worked:

We focused on the one or two decisions that matter most per flow.

Instead of:  
*Go to websites > Fill out website settings > confirm > Go to articles > menu > create article > fill out settings > schedule > confirm.*

We chose a simple ""in your face"" approach.

1. Inform your website
2. Click ""generate article""
3. Go drink your terrible sugared coffee

You may think that's stupid,

Maybe users will feel stupid.

And that's the goal.

An MVP should be so simple that it's *stupidly inevitable* to use.

In this new version, Motion and micro-interactions became a part of the core user experience.

Result: 10+ active subscriptions immediately after launch.

Takeaway: An MVP ideally solves a single problem,  that works wonderfully with agentic interfaces. No reinventing the wheel, but simply leverage what users want, and make it impossible NOT use your product.

I first noticed him when we arrived here. Mom was moving in all of our boxes and furniture, and I was sitting on a box labelled “fragile,” downing ice-cold lemonade. It was just a glimpse. One of the movers asked me to help with a box of kitchen equipment. 

I was struggling to get a proper grip on it, twisting around to shout that I needed help, when I saw him.

Not much of a person, more of a shadow poking from behind the fence. What I could make out was a tallish figure with mousey hair.

I lifted my hand in greeting, but the guy walked away. I didn’t think much of it.

Maybe he was shy.

Though I was curious about my neighbors, I was expecting them to join the parade of families on our doorstep bearing every food you can imagine.

But they stayed away. 

There was a large wooden fence separating us, so if I really wanted to talk to them, I’d either have to grow several feet taller or invest in stilts. 

I’m not sure why I was so obsessed with meeting them.

I knew they had kids my age. I could hear them.

According to Mom, who heard it from the nice lady across the street, our neighbors were called The Lockwoods.

There was a single mother and her four teenage kids.

So, the mystery shadow guy must have been a Lockwood kid.

I was told not to get too excited, though. Apparently, Mrs. Lockwood was very protective of her children and homeschooled them.

So, there was no chance of me making friends or even getting to know them. 

On our second day at our new place, Mom told me over breakfast that Mrs. Lockwood had sent out a polite notice to the neighborhood that her children were not to be disturbed or talked to. 

Which was crazy. I thought that was weird, but Mom understood it and to my annoyance, accepted the woman’s stupid warning. 

I was told not to talk to the Lockwood children.

And if I did, that meant an automatic week of grounding. 

According to Mom, she figured they were just a private family, and she wanted to accept that. She theorized the kids had been bullied at public school and had to be homeschooled. 

But I was skeptical. 

“*All* of them?” I asked her through a mouthful of cereal.

“Madeline.” Mom sent me a warning look, sipping her coffee. “What we’re going to do is respect Mrs. Lockwood’s wishes.”

“It’s child abuse,” I muttered into my Frosted Flakes. 

Mom reached across the table and poked  me with the prongs of her fork.

“Ow!”

“Don’t play with your food.”

“I’m not playing with my food.” I held up a spoonful of soggy cereal. “You just never get the chocolate brand. These taste like sandpaper.”

“We are going to be respectable neighbors,” Mom said, ignoring me. “So, you are not going to speak to those kids. Do you understand?”

I knew Mom only wanted to abide by the weird rules because she was obsessed with joining the mom’s club, or whatever they were called, but it didn’t make sense that this woman wasn’t letting her own kids have a social life. At a younger age, maybe eleven or twelve, I could understand. But seventeen? 

That was almost college age. 

What, was she expecting to coddle them forever?

Did she really think these kids were going to stay with her? 

Seventeen was the age of finding first loves and making mistakes. Not staying at home with mommy. 

“Okay, but would you do this to me?” I asked her. “Would you really lock me up and stop me from going outside and living my life?”

Mom was spreading butter on bread. I didn’t realize her mood had drastically changed until she was almost slicing her finger with the knife.

“You don’t know this yet because you are far too young,” she lifted her head, her lips curving into a smile. 

“But there is something called a mother’s instinct. When our children are born, we are overcome with an almost… feral need to protect them from danger. If you look it up, it is present in every creature.""

""Every mother. Our children are worth more than ourselves. We give our own lives to keep them alive. You can roll your eyes and say it’s stupid, but I’m sure as soon as you have your own child, you will feel the exact same with them.”

She nodded at me. “I had that with you. I… I still have it with you, Madeline. No matter how old you are. When you were a baby, I wanted to hold you in my arms every second of every day. I hated it when people wanted to hold you, and you were such a clingy baby. Always cradled to my chest.”

She waved the knife in the air. “As you grew up, I started to understand that you were seeing the world for the first time and needed your own time and space. I let you take your first steps on your own.""

""I cried when you said your first word and when I grabbed your hand and raced down the kindergarten steps for the first time. Letting you go was painful. And if I had a choice? Yes, I would keep you in here.""

She slammed the knife down, and I almost jumped out of my seat. 

“Because this planet is a scary place, Madeline. And as mothers, it is our job to keep our kids safe. Even if that means going to the slightest of extremes.”

“Slightest of extremes?” I scoffed, despite knowing I was being pedantic. “They have to fly the nest! That’s called growing up!”

Ignoring her glare, I continued.

“Yes, I believe in a mother’s instinct. But at what point do you have to look at yourself and realize you’re being ridiculous? Seventeen-year-olds aren’t infants. They won’t just blindly walk into traffic. They have self-awareness of what is wrong and right.”

I pointed at myself. “You let me drive, right? I got my license. Where was your ‘mother instinct’ when I got myself a big-girl vehicle I could easily have an accident in?”

Mom curled her lip. “Don’t push it.”

Leaning across the table, I fixed her with a smile. “See? You trust me, Mom. You let me grow up. That’s the difference between you and Mrs. Lockwood. Kids have to grow up, no matter what the circumstances are. It’s just part of being human. We all grow up and leave our parents.”

I sent her a look, stirring the soggy soup of my cereal. “Well, unless you’re Mrs. Lockwood.”

Mom finished her coffee and stood up. “You don’t even know these children. They could be in any stage of development, which makes them very different from you. All kids mentally age at different points.”

She took her plate to the faucet and dumped it in the bowl. Mom washed the dishes when she was angry or stressed, and she was really going to town on our brand-new pattern plates. I saw that as a mark of finality.

“I’m done talking about this, okay? You’re not eighteen yet, which means you abide by my rules. And really, Madeline, I’m not holding you prisoner. ""

""I’m asking you to be polite and follow a simple rule. We are a new family, and we need to make a good impression. Which means no talking to Mrs. Lockwood’s children.” She cleared her throat.

“Respect our neighbor’s wishes or lose your phone.”

Ducking my head, I continued to stir my cereal into a mushy soup, which had quickly become unappetizing. 

It looked like barf, so I pushed it away.

“You only want me to follow the rules so you can get into Mrs. Becker’s book club and go on Pilates dates with middle-aged Karens.”

Mom dropped a plate in the sink, and the sound of the splash made me flinch slightly.

“Is that understood?”

“Yes,” I said, rolling my eyes. “Obviously, I will abide by this street’s draconian rules so I can continue scrolling through TikTok.”

It was sarcasm, but I wasn’t sure my mother could detect it. She was so blinded by becoming one with our neighbors.

Why was she so obsessed with meeting all the other moms anyway?

Was she planning on setting me up on a playdate with three-year-old Evie? 

I wouldn’t put it past her to do that for the brownie points.

“Good. End of conversation,” Mom said, hurrying to get her jacket and bag. “I’m late for work, and you have an induction to get to.”

I wanted to argue further because this sounded unfair. The kids were teenagers, right? How were they not arguing against this? It seemed insane that they were going along with what their mother said. 

But I was aware of significant punishment if I broke this rule, so I begrudgingly agreed.

Until Nick.

Our first meeting was... awkward, and by awkward, I mean I was singing show tunes into my hairbrush, dancing around my room. I saw him out of the corner of my eye, almost choking on the lyrics.

The boy was my age, standing at the window opposite mine, a mess of dark blonde curls and freckles.

His smile was wide, laughing at me.

When he started slow clapping, I yanked my curtains shut, my cheeks burning.

Fuck.

I was mortified.

The next morning, I could see the boy’s shadow struggling to stay hidden behind his curtain while simultaneously holding up a whiteboard: **“If it makes you feel better, I can't hear you! Nice dance moves ;)”**

When he peeked through the curtain with wide eyes, I laughed.

I grabbed my notebook. **So, you're a peeker.”**

When he looked  confused, I sighed, scribbling, **""I'm Madeline!**

After some intense writing and erasing, the boy held up his whiteboard: **“Hi! You're a great singer ;)”**

**”So you could hear me!”** I shot back.

He shrugged, scribbling: **”What was the song you were singing?”**

**“High School Musical!”**

**""I've never heard of it!""** He replied with a lopsided smile.

**""Seriously????""**

His lips broke out into a grin. **“Seriously.”**

I rolled my eyes, and that made him laugh. I was a little too giddy. 

**“It’s nice to meet you, Madeline.”** He sent back with a little smudged smiley face.

We talked about everything, from school to his life at home. 

He had three siblings: Matilda, Freddie, and Isaac. 

He liked to play the guitar and draw, but apparently, he sucked at both. 

When I asked what his favorite TV show was, he looked confused for a moment before answering “All of them.”

Following that odd answer, I asked if he liked Marvel, and again, he had that look of confusion. But I knew he was trying to make a good impression. 

**“What is Marvel?”** he wrote back, this time his handwriting in a bubbly font. I could almost call his writing calligraphy. 

It practically danced off the page. 

The Lockwood boy’s strange answers made me wonder if this kid had been home-schooled his whole life. He seemed way too polite.

There was a certain amount of respect you had to pay to your elders and parents. 

But looking at this kid, I wasn’t even sure he knew what a meme was or even the concept of a joke. 

He had no idea about one of the biggest movie franchises in the world, and his favorite celebrity was apparently **“All of them.”** 

In fact, he had answered **“All of them”** to several of my questions. 

His messages reminded me of my grandma’s. 

Still, he was good company. Though I made it my mission to convert him into a normal teenager.

I had to guess, due to constantly being home and around the same people, this kid had zero social skills. I asked him what his favorite movie was, out of the posters on the wall. He had Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs, and Fight Club.

Again, he looked confused. His head cocked to the side, and I had to physically point to them behind him.

**“All of them,”** he wrote back with a smiley face.

This kid needed to see a movie that wasn’t educational. 

I bet his mother had turned him into the *perfect* member of society.

**“What HAVE you seen?”** I couldn’t help asking him, lounging on my window seat, iced tea in my lap. I enjoyed talking to him. 

**“Like, movies, TV shows. Do you play video games?”**

He shook his head before scribbling back. **“What is that?”**

Holy shit, this kid was completely cut off from the outside world.

I was already mentally thinking up plans to get him out of the house and to a party, or something like that. 

From the look on this kid's face, a slightly blank if not completely innocent smile, he needed time away from home. 

Away from his overprotective mother’s wicked grasp.

After a while, I realized he never told me his name. I didn’t notice time go by. 

Almost three hours, and I’d spent most of it lecturing him on movies and TV shows he really should have known. 

I guessed Mrs. Lockwood didn’t let him watch TV. 

My gaze flicked to his laptop, and I wouldn’t have been surprised if she blocked all social media. 

My notepad was full of scribbles and doodles, an attempt at copying his handwriting style. The sky was blooming into twilight outside, thick orange and cotton candy pink streaking the horizon. 

I’ve always loved a pre-twilight sky.

**“What’s your name?”** I wrote in permanent marker, before holding up my notepad. I was running out of paper. 

I could hear Mom downstairs preparing dinner, and I could tell from his diminishing smile that Mrs. Lockwood was probably shouting for him. 

He didn’t reply for a while. I watched him put the pad down before heading over to his desk, cleaning up the paper, every trace that we had been talking, and dumping each response he’d given in the trash. 

He slumped onto his bed, wrote something down in several strokes, and then held it up for me to see.

**“Nick :)”’** He’d written. **“My name is Nicholas Lockwood.”**

For a moment, his expression changed completely. He glanced at the door, frowning at the pad of paper in his lap.

It looked like he wanted to write more, but then his eyes widened. Someone was coming. I could tell by the look on his face.

The knot between his brows.

Nick gathered everything he’d been using to write to me, pens, pencils, scraps of paper, and the backs of movie posters, shoving them under his bed. 

Then he grabbed the curtains and pulled them closed, blocking me out once again. 

I thought he’d come back, but after standing there like an idiot with an odd feeling in my gut, frowning at his curtains, I realized he was finished talking to me for the night. 

I had expected that to be it. I didn’t think he’d come back. But the next morning, he was back at his window, smiling at me through a mouthful of toothpaste. He was still in his pajamas, his unbrushed curls falling into his sleepy eyes.

He looked strange without his glasses, like his face was too bare. 

The more I took him in, though, something seemed... different, though I couldn’t quite make it out. 

Then it hit me.

Nick wasn’t moving. He was staying in the same position. 

The night before, he had gone back and forth from his bed, hurrying around to grab things to write with. 

But now he stood still, looking more like a shadow than a human. 

I quickly dove for my notepad, but Nick was already holding up his own greeting with a grin. ""Good morning, Madeline! How are you feeling today?""

""Tired,"" I wrote back, my handwriting barely legible. ""Do you have school?""

""YES,"" he responded with an excited smile. ""I’m so excited to learn! Do you have a favorite class?""

I laughed at that, and after looking confused for a moment, he copied my laugh, which made me laugh harder.

""None of them!"" I scribbled. ""School is boring!""

Nick shrugged. ""I like it. I have a great tutor.""

""Really?"" I wrote, attempting a rolling-eyes emoji. ""You shouldn’t be excited for school. Weirdo.""

He curled his lip. ""You’re the weirdo,"" he wrote back. Nick paused, chewing on the lid of his pen, before adding, ""What’s a weirdo?""

""You’re kidding!"" 

We talked as I got ready for school, gathering my books and homework. 

I was stuffing my gym clothes into my bag when I noticed something on the ground behind Nick. 

Looking closer, it seemed like a cord. 

Like a long cable or something. At first, I thought it was for a game console, but then I remembered he had no idea what a video game was. 

I didn’t question it for a while. We talked every night, about everything and nothing.

I told Nick about school and friends, using up every scrap of paper in the house, and he told me about his siblings. They were all the same age and all enjoyed school. 

His brother was a piano prodigy, while his sister’s were ballerina’s. 

Nick said he felt like the odd one out, being the artist of the family, and I quickly told him that creativity was the best part of a person.

He showed me his drawings. To my confusion, and slight disgust, they were all of his mother. 

They were good, sure. 

His skills were Ivy League worthy. The shading was perfect. Everything about the drawings was perfect.

But the fact that his muse was his mother… it left a weird taste in my mouth. 

He showed me each drawing, his smile widening with excitement while I nodded and pretended to be impressed. 

Well, I was.

But it became startlingly obvious that Nick didn’t have a choice in what he drew. He didn’t draw fruit or landscapes, or even the sky. We live in a picturesque town, the perfect canvas for an artist. 

However, Mrs. Lockwood was at the center of every single drawing and painting, every ink blot. 

Even with different styles and angles, she was always there. 

And Nick Lockwood saw nothing wrong with it. He saw absolutely no issue with this woman controlling every aspect of his life. His social life, his friends, his education, and even his hobbies.

I half expected him to grab a guitar and start singing about her through the glass. 

I couldn’t take it anymore. It was driving me crazy. We continued to talk by writing to each other, but soon enough, the only subject was his mother. Nick asked me if I could rate a drawing he was working on. 

It was her. 

Of course it was. 

I ignored him, getting to my feet and holding up the sign I had written weeks ago, but I was too scared to show him.

I didn’t want to ruin our friendship, but I had to know. I had to know several things that had been keeping me up all night.

""Why are you okay with your mother controlling your life?"" I asked in bold letters.

And below that: ""Also… I’ve been wondering for a while… what is that thing behind you?""

The thing behind him had been the center of my thoughts. I had figured out it wasn’t a cord for a TV or a game console, not even a laptop or a guitar. 

And it was always there. 

Morning and evening, even at night when I spied on him getting ready for bed, this thing was always on the floor, snaked across his bed. 

Sometimes it was even wrapped up on his desk. 

I couldn’t figure out the length of it. I asked friends at school and even looked it up on the internet, but my descriptions didn’t do it justice, a long, silver cord-like thing that didn’t have an end.

Nick blinked at my message before ducking his head and starting to write. He held up his response.

""I love my mom,"" he wrote, doodling a little heart. ""She doesn’t control my life. I like that she’s in it.""

Below that, a follow-up message twisted my gut. ""What do you mean? I don’t see anything, Madeline.""

Tapping my pad with my pen, I struggled to think of a response. 

There was no way he couldn’t see this thing.

It was hard to miss. 

Instead of writing, I pointed behind him.

“That!”

“What?” His handwriting was slipping slightly, and I noticed his hands were visibly shaking. “What can you see, Madeline?”

This time, he stood up. I noticed something change in him, the notepad slipping off his knee. Nick turned around, scanning the room.

His eyes finally found the cord-thing. His smile seemed to dampen, eyes going wide, fists clenching.

“Nick?” I hurriedly wrote when he didn’t move for a while. 

His gaze was glued to the cord. 

I watched his eyes follow it around the room before his hand slowly raised, trembling fingers moving to his neck and then the back of his head. 

Was there an insect? That’s what I thought.

It must have been a spider or some kind of bug that startled him. I could only describe his expression as catatonic. 

He stood up but then quickly slumped back down, like it wasn't his choice. 

It was as if he was being dragged down by an unseen force. 

One minute I was looking at Nick Lockwood, and the next I was seeing a stranger, a completely different person take over a rapidly paling face. 

Something snapped inside my gut when he moved forward suddenly, his arms lunging out to close the curtains.

But that wasn’t the end of what I saw. 

The boy had unknowingly left a splinter, a tiny gap allowing me to glimpse inside. 

I expected him to react to whatever had freaked him out. Instead, he simply flopped back onto his bed. 

This time, I noticed the silver cord jolt with his movement. 

He was already asleep, eyes closed. I watched him, my heart leaping into my throat. There was no way he just fell asleep like that. it was too fast.

Mrs. Lockwood came into his room soon after. But I only got a glimpse of her as she was already striding over to the window. I ducked behind my bed, panic creeping up my spine. I expected her to start yelling at me through the window, but instead, she simply pulled the curtains properly shut. 

Mrs. Lockwood definitely saw me. 

Even if she didn’t, Nick’s messages to me were still piled on his bedsheets. 

I was left completely in the dark then. I stood and pressed my face against the window, fully aware that I was addicted to the mystery surrounding my neighbor.

My mind began to wander to uncertain and scary places.

What exactly was Nick’s mother doing to him behind the curtain?

I wanted to believe she was simply tucking him in and saying goodnight, but the strange cord-like thing on the ground and how he’d reacted to noticing it.

I refused to believe Mrs. Lockwood was innocent. I waited for him to draw his curtains again.

But he didn’t. 

Nick’s window stayed completely blocked for days. 

I stopped hearing his siblings in the yard, and after days of nothing, Mom reiterated her warning to me over dinner. “No communication with the Lockwood children,” she told me. “Which includes notes and letters.”

Busted.

So, Mrs. Lockwood knew we were talking.

I wondered if she was punishing her son for breaking the rules—and that was why he had been MIA for the last few days.

“There’s something wrong with Nick,” I worked up the courage to tell Mom. “The boy next door. I think Mrs. Lockwood is hurting him.”

“Hurting him?”

“Yeah, like…” I frowned. “I think she can make him go to sleep when she wants.” I pulled a face. “Like, hypnotism, or maybe even drugs.”

“Mmm hmm.”

“Drugs, Mom,” I said. “Mrs. Lockwood is drugging her seventeen-year-old son!”

“That’s nice, honey.”

“Are you even listening to me?” I leaned across the table, stabbing the page of her book. “Mom! Nick Lockwood is a total blank slate!”

“I’ve told you a thousand times. She’s protecting them,” she hummed. 

“You’ve just seen far too many crime dramas, and your generation has been poisoned by the likes of crime entertainment. Finding what you think is your own mystery must be fun, but you’re reaching, baby.”

“Reaching?” I prodded my own temple. “I’m sorry, were you not listening when I told you he doesn’t even know what video games are?”

Mom was acting weird. Usually, she talked about school with me and at least tried to engage in conversation, but she was too busy reading the book Mrs. Becker had recommended. It was like talking to a brick.

“You’re being ridiculous, Madeline,” she said with a sigh, turning a page. “I’ve spoken to his mother. She’s a lovely woman. We’re having lunch next week.”

“What a coincidence,” I shot her a look over my phone, looking up helplines. “You’re suddenly *best friends* with the neighborhood witch when I’m caught talking to her son.” 

Dropping my phone for emphasis, I stood up. “If you would just listen to me—”

“That’s enough,” Mom cut me off. She finished her coffee, grabbing her jacket from where it was slung over a chair. “Stay out of trouble, okay? I’m heading back to work. I’ve left cash if you want to order pizza. 

""You have other interests, alright? Please, leave Mrs. Lockwood alone. This obsession you have with her kids is unhealthy. Why don’t you stick to fiction, hm?”

Yeah, no.

As soon as she was gone, I sprinted to my room to see if Nick’s curtains were open. To my dismay, they weren’t.

Frustrated, I yanked mine shut too.

Slumping onto my bed, I continued looking up helplines. I got bored soon after and started googling cords and wires that fit the description of what I’d seen.

There was a match, though it was on a weird medical website that looked like it had been made in 2005. The interface was outdated, and according to the description, it was some kind of clamping device. 

There were a lot of words I didn’t know, and after further googling, I was getting increasingly confused. 

And what did this thing even connect to?

A sudden THUD made me almost jump out of my skin. I slid off my bed.

THUD.

It was coming from my window. My curtains were still shut, blowing in the slight breeze. Slowly, I made my way over, my spine tingling.

THUD.

THUD.

THUD.

The first thing I saw was red. Bright, intense scarlet spattering the Lockwood boy's window. Then I glimpsed Nick. 

He was slamming his face into the glass, over and over again, his already bleeding nose exploding with more red. But it wasn’t the boy I knew, the kid I had gotten to know over the last few months. No. 

This kid was a mess of torn-up clothes, bruises yellowing his eyes, and scratches sliced into his flesh. My first thought was his mom. She must have done this to him. 

But then my gaze found his bloodied nails and the claw marks on his arms and cheeks. There was something white wrapped around his head. It was a bandage.

I could glimpse red leaking through, smudging the clinical white and pooling down his temples in sharp rivulets. Nick’s eyes were an enigma in themselves, a mixture of fear, confusion, and an almost feral look of anger and frustration. But the twitch in his lip and between his brow was evidence that something was fighting that.

Emotions and feelings he wasn’t feeling himself.

It was like looking at two different guys. One was Nick, the artist who lived next door, who ended every message with a smiley face. 

But this twisted other self, this broken, feral self, was a whole other person. 

I started to realize the more I looked at him, at the mess of flesh and blood caught between his nails, and his trembling hands, every so often creeping to the back of his skull before jolting back to curl into fists, battering the window, that he had clawed into his own head. Immediately, I reached for my phone. But he already knew what I was going to do.

“No!” he mouthed, shaking his head, so I grabbed my notepad. I could barely write.

“What’s going on?” I held up my pad. “Are you okay???”

Instead of using a pen and paper, Nick squinted, blinking rapidly. His handwriting was different, a manic scrawl, as he wrote in the explosion of blood on the window.

When he twisted around, his gaze going to the door, the breath caught in my throat. Someone was yelling his name. I could tell by his reaction. 

His bloodied fingers clawed at his face and hair, at bald patches and rugged stitches lining his scalp and the back of his skull. 

They kept going, a narrow line of stitches all the way down his neck, and presumably his spine.

My thoughts flashed back to the equipment I’d been looking up. This kind of thing was designed to bury into the brain and spinal cord. I looked for it, but the thing was nowhere to be seen on him. 

It was no longer on the floor. Nick struggled to write coherently. I noticed he kept swearing, his finger smudging the words he was trying to write. 

This was more like it, I thought. This was the kind of boy I had expected to be the kid next door.

“Fuck.” He shook his head, his movements erratic as one hand went to the back of his head and came back slick with glistening red.

Fuck.

Fuck.

Fuck!

He slammed his fists into the window in frustration, but I was already seeing his message start to blossom and make sense.

WHO.

Nick was crying. I could see that he could barely breathe, struggling to inhale, swiping at his eyes with smudged fists.

AM.

I?

I started to back away, but he continued. When he’d finished, he wrote it again and again, growing more and more fraught.

I jumped when he slammed his head into the glass again. At first, a part of me thought he was using his blood for paint.

So he was intentionally hurting himself to draw more.

But his words spelled it out for me in black and white.

Who am I? he wrote. WHO AM I? WHO AM I WHO AM I? WHO AM I?

This time, I could barely even read my own handwriting. I held up a scrap of paper.

“DID YOUR MOM HURT YOU?”

I gestured to the bandage on his head, and he stumbled back, wild eyes searching for something to write with.

THAT WOMAN. He scribbled in block capitals.

THAT WOMAN IS NOT MY FUCKING MOM. He wrote, before dropping to his knees. He was still writing but failing to show me.

I don’t know who I am.

He wrote the same thing 12 times, before tearing up the paper and burying his head in his lap.

I gave up writing messages.

“Nick!” I shouted.

Then I threw a rock at his window, and he lifted his head, blinking rapidly.

Gesturing for him to open his window, he struggled with the latch for a moment before pulling it open.

I stuck my head out of my own window, cold air hitting me in the face. “I’m going to help you,” I managed to choke out. “Hold on, okay?”

Nick clawed at his face. ""Help me."" His voice was a sharp hiss. 

""Please help me. I don't know who I..."" His fingernails ripped into the flesh of his cheeks, but he barely seemed to feel it, to be fazed. They kept going, digging into layer after layer. ""I don't know who I am."" 

He jumped up suddenly, trashing his desk and throwing his laptop against the wall. 

He reminded me of a child having a tantrum. In this case though, it was more than acting out. I was sure that Nick Lockwood didn’t exist. ""I don't know who I am. I don't know... fuck... I don't know who I am!”

His eyes found mine, and I could have sworn I saw something there, buried deep inside his pupil.

He blinked, and it was gone.

“You need to tell me what she’s done to you,” I said stiffly. “Tell me what she’s done to your head.”

Nick was only growing progressively more frenzied. Animalistic. 

He came back to the window, slamming his fists into it. Then his head. Again and again. Like he was trying to knock himself out. ""Help me. I can't remember... I can't remember who I am. I just know... I know her.”

His lips suddenly twisted into a startling grin.

“Mom,” he whispered, his expression softening. “My mom.” His gaze flicked to the desk. “She won’t like that I’ve… I’ve made a mess.”

“Your mom did this,” I gritted out. “I’m calling the cops.”

His expression was scaring me. Whatever was in his eye was scaring me. But this boy needed help. He needed to be taken out of that house.

""No,"" Nick sobered up. ""No, my mom... my mommy said... she said no police."" 

His eyes widened suddenly, seemingly noticing the mess on the window for the first time. “Oh, god.” Nick stumbled back. “I should… I should clean this. Before my mom sees what a mess I made.”

His door opened, and another head poked through.

Another guy. I figured it was one of his brothers, Freddie or Isaac. He too had a bandage wrapped around his head.

His brother’s eyes found the blood spatters, and then me. Like his mother, he strode over to the window, shutting the curtains.

But I could still hear it.

A mechanical whirring noise, followed by Nick’s sharp breath and the sickly crunch of metal protruding through blood and bone.

That was it.

“Mom!” I yelled. I’d heard her come back earlier. She must have finished work early.

I stumbled downstairs to tell her to call the cops, but a shadow was already looming behind the corner. 

Before I knew what was happening, a wet rag stinking of pool cleaner was being pressed over my mouth and nose.

I don’t remember passing out. 

When I woke up, I was lying on my mom’s couch. It was dark outside, but the curtains were open. 

My foggy thoughts drank in slithers of moon poking from between the clouds before registering I wasn’t alone. Sitting up, my stomach galloped. 

There was no sign of Mom. 

But I recognized each of the faces surrounding me. Mrs. Becker was sitting with her legs crossed, delicately sipping from a cup. And next to her, wearing a smug smile, was Mrs. Lockwood. She wasn’t looking at me. 

Instead, her eyes were lovingly glued to something that had been built over Mom’s coffee table.

 It was made completely out of paper. The scraps of paper I had been using to talk to her son. Though there weren’t just my messages. I glimpsed Nick’s writing too. It was a house. I was staring at a perfect paper rendition of the Lockwood house. And next to it stood four little paper dolls.

There were no faces. No expressions. Just four dolls. Two boys, and two girls.

The girls wore paper tutu’s. 

One of the boys sat at a paper piano. 

Mrs. Lockwood’s nimble fingers were working to make more of them. They filled her lap, differing in size.

“*Maddy*, is it?”

Her voice was smooth like chocolate. I could almost mistake it for kindness.

“Madeline.” I whispered. 

Her lips twitched. “I prefer Maddy. May I call you Maddy?”

I nodded, my heart in my throat. I was watching her create another doll. 

She folded a piece of paper in half, cut it in two, and started folding sections, bringing the doll to life. 

Unlike the others, this one had real attention put into it. She even added the birthmark on my right temple, followed by coloring in my dark blonde hair, and finishing with my jean jacket. Mrs. Lockwood didn’t need to spell it out for me. 

When she got to the doll’s head, she shocked me by tearing it off. Then she ripped off its arms, legs, and finally tore its torso in half.

Mrs. Lockwood straightened up. “Maddy, are you aware of a mother’s instinct?”

I couldn’t reply. Instead, I stared at the paper doll she had set alight. 

I watched the smoldering orange devour it before she put the fire out, dropping the blackened doll on the carpet. For just a brief second, I could have sworn the hem of my jacket had caught alight too. 

Just a single flash of orange. But maybe I was seeing things.

“I was pregnant with four beautiful children,” she said softly. “As soon as I found out, I had already named them.” Her smile was dreamy, melancholic. 

“Freddie, my little Freddie. He kicked quite a lot. Oh, and Matilda. She and her twin were quite the pair, swiftly draining me of my energy so I had to take medication.” Mrs. Lockwood  chuckled.

“And finally, Nicholas. I loved him with all my heart. He was my little fighter.” 

She quickly lost her smile, her gaze flicking back to me. 

“I hope you understand that if you talk to, or even breathe the same air as my children again, I will rip you apart too.”

Mrs. Lockwood  never raised her voice. She didn’t need to. I was terrified of her.

She held up my doll for emphasis before throwing it into the paper dollhouse. 

“Or… perhaps you could become another daughter of mine, hmm?” I couldn’t move, my body paralyzed as she leaned over me, her cruel eyes drinking me in. 

“Maybe not,” she hummed. 

“I only take the dead or dying.” Straightening up, she sighed. “It’s not a hard task, Maddy. Keep away from my children, and I will keep away from you.”

They left after that, leaving me frozen, unable to move or breathe. They took the dollhouse. All of the paper. Even my doll.

Nick has been unreachable since. Mom has hardly been home and I’m starting to lose my mind.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know who or what Mrs. Lockwood  is, but I’m afraid she’s going to keep adding to her collection.

Whoever those kids are, they’re not hers. I think she’s taken them. She’s using them as canvases, as dolls—for what she’s lost.

1ofghjd,https://i.redd.it/9g4eii9g76xf1.jpeg,3 ways to stop shame (for me),"1. Remember that life is too short to not live in the lighter side. 

If we cant laugh at the awkward moments Im not sure why. Life's all a bit embarrassing sometimes. We sh*t, p*ss, bleed, sneeze, cough, cry, fart, snort, trip, fall, and generally do embarressing human things from time to time. So when others do these things we usually give them grace, then later, hopefully, we'll find it funny. Like when I dressed up the first time in public and needed to go pee so bad. I felt so nervous I had to pee in a coffee cup in my car because I was too afraid to step outside and go into a rest station. I got it ALL OVER!  Now at the time I felt so stupid. Now, I laugh my head off when I think of it or tell it to a friend. Got to find light in the dark. Its there. Embrace it. 🤣

2. Remember that choice is a choice. 

I have a choice to choose to be okay with me. I may not have chosen the way I was born or the place, but I do get to choose to accept parts of me or deny parts of me. I get to choose to play a victim or a creator moving forward despite yesterday. It puts the power back in my hands. I choose to accept me. (I didn't always)

3. Remember that love isn't all about being loved, its also about ""giving"" love. 

A puppy needs attention. They crave it, they beg for it. Before I had my own dog I hated this. I resented dogs taking love from me (not what they do, its how I interpreted it back then). I used to feel exhausted by life and then a dog would come a long and beg me to give more of me. I didnt want to. I wanted to receive love. I needed to FEEL loved. We all do. 

I found myself often feeling empty and needing others to fill me up. But now I see it all a bit different. Now... I give love freely. I dont need my dog to give me love. I give her love. It feels so good to give. I dont need you to tell me im okay, I get more out of telling you that you are okay. That you are loved. Its a twist thst works for me, and one worth trying and practicing. You have more in you than you think. You are brighter than you know. 

In summary, at least for me, these things help me let go of shame and embrace all the parts of me, awkward, not standard, totally human parts of me. Love to you all my fine feathered friends.

1ofgfje,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALS/comments/1ofgfje/did_i_do_enough/,Did I Do Enough?,"My dad passed away just over a month ago; he chose to forego a ventilator, and eventually he simply lacked the strength to take the next breath. I was by his side when it happened, and while I missed the precise moment of his passing (it took a while for me to realize how quiet it became without the sound of his breathing), I know he recognized my presence, and that brings me some comfort.

My emotions are going through the ringer, like everyone experiences after something like this. I keep asking questions that don't have any answers. Why him? Why this horrible, evil, disease? Why now, right after he retired, and when he was so, so excited to be a grandpa? There are no answers, so I don't try to seek them. But the question that continues to haunt me is, ""Did I do enough?""

The diagnosis was given almost two years ago, and as the disease progressed, I did my best to spend more time with both him and my mom, keeping them company, helping out around their house, etc. I'm glad I was close enough to be able to make frequent weekend trips, and that I could work remotely from their house for longer visits. But, I have two little ones, a house with too many unfinished projects, and a wife who was taking on more than her fair share of the load. I couldn't leave all that behind for months on end.

But maybe I should have. I knew his time was running out, yet after every trip I would pack my things and leave for home all the same. If I had just stayed, maybe I would have made his last days happier. Maybe I would have gathered up the courage to have the conversations I was too scared to bring up while he was battling his disease. Maybe I could at least rest a little easier, knowing I gave him 100% of me through all of this.

Instead, I tried to juggle everything, and it feels like I've dropped it all.

I know I'll be spending this next chapter of my life picking up the pieces that are left. I'll help my mom navigate the life of a widow, and I'll be more present for my kids and my wife. I can still support the people who are important to me.

But my dad is gone. I won't get any more chances to spend time with him. I'll never speak with him again. I'll never be able to share a cup of coffee with him, or a glass of bourbon. We won't share anymore terrible dad jokes. I'll never get to show him how amazing his grandkids are going to be.

I am someone who
- gets nervous when texting someone something either emotionally or mentally vulnerable; I compensate by always leaving my do not disturb on, and when it’s off, I get nervous checking messages.
- does not like picking up phone calls 
- talks to oneself
- not afraid with being loud or oversharing in front of family and friends 
- a bit clumsy sometimes/doesn’t pay attention to surroundings, because I’m in my own head 
- hates when people take my words literally
- when talking with people, I tend to place focus on just me and them, which leads me to ignore surroundings
- gets annoyed when people speak about trivial and surface level stuff, only if it’s not something we both share in common and that can lead to an engaging conversation. 
- likes new things, but will stick with old things until I get the full value out of them (I listen to the same album non-stop for years at a time) 
- likes when things are clean but doesn’t like to put too much effort into starting it, will maintain the clean environment though
- loves music and expressing myself fearlessly, I sing songs with people I know well but not with people I’m not so well acquainted with
- hates when people are overly competitive because it unintentionally gets to me & stresses me out
- likes the little things in life because they make the present life less dreadful (like an iced coffee)
- lives heavily in the future and often fantasizes about the coming weeks so I can get through my day
- uses the excuse of my plan of achieving success one day as a reason of my current actions
- never follows a set routine; I always switch something up every day 
- only does things when I’m ready if it’s a big deal, and if I don’t have a time to decide, I freeze and often yell or stress out
- has strong values, but also the type to read comments on Instagram Reels before making an internal decision on whether it’s funny or not
- procrastinates doing easy things that are boring and tedious rather than hard things that are engaging and interesting 
- if something is to get to be done, I will get it done IF there are no external factors pressuring me — there is nothing more 
- very very long hours spent thinking about myself deeply and what I am to my core
-has struggled for years with my MBTI, since I’m someone who tends to see things very black and white
- does not plan outfits for everyday 
- makes to do lists on the notes app and forgets about them immediately after, but still gets things done  (schedules >> lists/plans)
- will forget an appointment if I don’t put it in my schedule and set seven alarms to remind me
- not focused on the way I look externally to an EXTENT. (less than my ESFP brother and ESTP sister, but I still put in effort for myself)
- under stress I can become very hyperfocused on my acne or physical appearance which is basically innacurate  ",1,1761359499.0,MbtiTypeMe,1,1.0,False

I’d love to hear what works for you. How detailed are your records? Do you ever revisit past brews to refine your approach? Are there any tools, apps, or systems that have made documenting and improving your coffee easier or more enjoyable? Anything pitfalls I should look out for?

Greek authorities made dozens of arrests on Wednesday related to [Greece’s spiraling farm fraud case](https://www.politico.eu/article/greece-farmers-european-union-opekepe-pastureland-cap-common-agricultural-policy-2/), in an investigation led by European prosecutors.

Some 37 people suspected of being members of an organized criminal group involved in large-scale agricultural funding fraud and money laundering activities were arrested, and searches were carried out throughout the country, according to [a statement](https://www.eppo.europa.eu/en/media/news/greece-eppo-arrests-37-members-organised-criminal-group-involved-large-scale) by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office.

Several ministers and deputy ministers have [resigned over their alleged involvement in the scandal](https://www.politico.eu/article/greek-farm-scandal-triggers-top-level-government-resignations/). [The EU has already fined Athens €400 million](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-greece-400m-fine-farm-aid-debacle-scandal-agriculture-farmers-courts-fraud/). Greece also risks [losing its EU farm subsidies](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-greece-farm-eu-subsidies-brussels-eppo/). The original deadline was Oct. 2, but this has now been pushed back to Nov. 4.

Wednesday’s operation centered on a criminal network accused of illegally obtaining EU farm subsidies through false declarations submitted to the organization in charge of distributing EU farm funds in Greece, OPEKEPE.

According to the EPPO, in the course of the preliminary investigation, 324 individuals were identified as subsidy recipients, causing an estimated cost of more than €19.6 million to the EU budget. Of these, 42 are believed to be involved in this case and are considered current members of the criminal group, says the EPPO.

Most of them appear to have no actual connection to farming or producing, according to the Greek and EU authorities.

The EPPO said that, at least since 2018, the group ""allegedly exploited procedural gaps"" in the submission of applications using falsified or misleading documents to claim agricultural subsidies from OPEKEPE. They are suspected of fraudulently declaring pastureland that did not belong to them or did not meet eligibility criteria. They allegedly inflated livestock numbers to increase their subsidy entitlements. To conceal the illicit origin of the proceeds, they are believed to have issued fictitious invoices, routed the funds through multiple bank accounts, and mixed them with legitimate income. Part of the misappropriated money was allegedly spent on luxury goods, travel and vehicles, to disguise the funds as lawful assets.

Greece’s anti-money laundering authority is investigating Giorgos Xylouris, a farmer from Crete and until recently member of ruling New Democracy. Xylouris is one of the key characters [mentioned in EPPO case files](https://www.politico.eu/article/greece-mitsotakis-farm-funds-fraud-eppo-opekepe-agriculture-farmer-pasture/), under the nickname Frappé (“Iced Coffee”), regarding the OPEKEPE scandal.

Some €2.5 million was discovered in his bank accounts during a random inspection, the Greek officials said. Authorities found that Xylouris had failed to submit the required financial documentation and could not justify the large sum. Eight vehicles were also identified in his possession, including a Jaguar luxury car. The case file has been sent to the prosecutors to examine possible violations of anti-bribery laws and an investigation is ongoing regarding whether money laundering has occurred.",2,1761359098.0,Koina,0,1.0,False

1ofg521,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeAdmissionGuide/comments/1ofg521/how_to_budget_as_a_university_student_in_australia/,How to Budget as a University Student in Australia,"Money management is one of those things that sound simple until you actually try it. Between rent, food, textbooks, and catching up with friends, your wallet can feel empty before the month even ends. Most students in Australia face this at some point. But a little bit of planning—and some smart habits—can save you a lot of stress.

Let’s break it down in plain, no-nonsense terms.

# 1. Know What’s Coming In and Going Out

Start with the basics: how much money do you actually have each month? Write it down somewhere, even if it’s just on your phone. Include income from your part-time job, family support, scholarships, or any government help.

Next, look at what you’re spending. Rent, transport, food, internet, random snacks—everything counts. It’s often surprising how the “small stuff” adds up. Once you see it all clearly, you can figure out what’s necessary and what’s not.

# 2. Create a Simple Budget That Actually Works

You don’t need fancy budgeting apps if you’re not into them. A simple notebook or spreadsheet will do. The idea is to plan how much you’ll spend each week (or month) and then stick close to it.

For example, if your monthly income is $1,200, you might spend:

* $500 on rent
* $200 on food
* $100 on transport
* $100 on bills
* $50 for fun stuff
* $50 for emergencies

The goal isn’t perfection. It’s awareness. When you know where your money’s going, it’s easier to make smart choices.

# 3. Don’t Miss Out on Student Discounts

Seriously, student discounts in Australia are gold. Always keep your student ID handy—it can save you money on travel, movies, clothes, and even meals.

Websites like **UNiDAYS** or **Student Edge** have deals for almost everything. And your university often runs free events or workshops with food included (never say no to free pizza). Little savings here and there really add up over time.

# 4. Cook More, Order Less

This one’s simple but powerful. Eating out every other day can crush your budget before you know it. Cooking at home is cheaper and, let’s be honest, usually healthier too.

Try meal prepping once or twice a week. Even basic dishes—like pasta or stir-fry—can last for days. And if you share meals or groceries with friends or roommates, it cuts costs even more.

# 5. Keep an Eye on Your Spending

Tracking your spending doesn’t mean you need to write down every coffee purchase (unless you want to). But do check where your money goes once a week.

There are free apps like **Pocketbook** or **Frollo** that connect to your bank account and do the tracking for you. Or, if you’re old school, just jot things down in a notebook. The point is to catch small habits that drain your money—like late-night food delivery or unnecessary subscriptions.

# 6. Find Cheaper Accommodation Options

Rent eats up a big chunk of any student’s budget. If you can, look for shared housing or student accommodation. Living a bit farther from campus can be cheaper, though make sure the transport costs don’t ruin the savings.

Websites like [**Flatmates.com.au**](http://Flatmates.com.au) and **Gumtree** are good places to start. Talk to seniors or classmates—they often know affordable and safe places nearby.

# 7. Save a Bit, Even if It’s Small

It’s easy to say “I’ll save later,” but starting small now is better than waiting. Even $10 or $20 a week goes a long way when something unexpected happens—like a broken laptop or sudden travel cost.

Set up a separate savings account. That way, you’re less tempted to spend it.

# 8. Pick Up a Part-Time Job or Side Gig

Most students in Australia work part-time, and it’s a great way to manage expenses. Jobs in retail, cafes, tutoring, or even freelance gigs can help you earn some extra money.

Websites like **Seek** and **Indeed** post student-friendly jobs daily. Just make sure you balance your work hours with your study load—you don’t want to burn out.

# 9. Be Real About Social Spending

This one’s tough. Australia has a lively social scene, and it’s easy to get caught up in it. You don’t have to say no to everything, but be selective. Maybe skip one night out and instead plan a cheap movie night with friends. Small swaps like that make a big difference over time.

# 10. Review and Adjust

Your budget won’t stay perfect forever. Expenses change—maybe your rent increases or your job hours decrease. So, review your budget every month or two. Adjust what needs changing and move on. Budgeting is more about staying aware than following strict rules.

# Final Thoughts

Budgeting isn’t about cutting all the fun from your life—it’s about knowing where your money goes and making it work for you. Start small, be consistent, and don’t beat yourself up if you slip once in a while.

University life in Australia can be expensive, but with a bit of planning, you can manage it without too much stress. And if academics ever get overwhelming, you can always visit [**getassignment.com.au**](https://getassignment.com.au) for expert help with your studies.

""Are you enjoying those pancakes?""

*""Yep they're super yummy.""*

""You're almost done would you like some more?""

*""Yes sir...is Kurtis alright?""*

""Kurtis?""

*"" Yes...my friend he was with me when you all saved us down by the river.""*

""Oh yes...the doctor is looking at him down stairs.""

*""Can I see him?""*

""I will go check when I get your pancakes.""

*15 minutes later*

**Grahhhh**

The dog shouted out as the saw finally cut through all the way

*I tried to save the back leg...but I failed sir?*

""You did good Whilma take a break""

Kemerskai looked down at the gagged diamond dog as he let out a small sigh he was a mess..bloody, wounded. How he got so far in this condition was a boreas bless miracle.

""The Emperor is fine, you however are not. The only reason you're alive is because you may contain useful information.""

The dog watched as the president pulled up a seat and sat next to him.

""Everyone out.""

All the guards leave as the president stared at the dog.

""Grover is upstairs eating breakfast he said he had to live off just apples.....poor thing...""

The sarcasm in that sentence was poignant.

""So tell me Kurt....do you want to help or do you want to....wrap things up.""

Kemerskai goes for the gag loosing it as he awaits a response

I had already drank my standard 16 oz iced coffee that morning. I guess the extra caffeine pushed me over the edge because 30 minutes later while still shopping I’m having the worst hot flash. I’m on 42, deep in peri (periods don‘t show up much anymore) and this is just the cherry on the crap sundae. My body can’t even handle extra caffeine now. It sounds silly but this made me feel so old, like I am fully aware I’m 42 not 24 and my partying days are over but jeez not even an extra cup of coffee? ",6,1761358773.0,Perimenopause,1,1.0,False

I made it and he was making coffee for the next day (he wakes up at 3am). He was looking/asking himself what to eat, I said there was naan bread, he then ask if we had any which I say yes because I just saw it, he said if I was sure and I said yes. He then said if I could heat it up and I said I didn’t want to because I was making the hot chocolate, he asked again and I said i didn’t want to. He then opens the fridge, take it out, and proceed to just throw it to the counter and start to heat up his bread. I said ‘you didn’t have to throw it’ and the mumbles to himself ‘shut up’ and I said ‘you shut up’. I just took a minute and said I was going up and he says ‘yeah you should’. 

Should I have just heat up his bread? Was this situation avoidable? Should I have said something else than no I don’t want to?

1ofg27j,https://i.redd.it/t4s1yryh36xf1.jpeg,help with sourdough please!,"Hi! So, for an assignment for one of my classes we have to make sourdough bread. In the picture I included the instructions for the first 3 steps (but that's not what i have a question on but read it and you'll see what I mean). It is currently 7:52 pm and I just started step 1 for day 1 at 7:45 PM. it tells me to let it sit out on the counter at room temperature for 24 hours. so that means tomorrow at 7:45 PM (for day 2) i will add the 3 Tbsp flour + 3 Tbsp filtered water, and then stir and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours. however if you notice it says on day 3 to add add 3 Tbsp flour + 3 Tbsp filtered water in the MORNING and stir and let it sit out at room temp for 12 hours. and then do the exact same in the evening. so my question is, if day one is today oct 24th at 7:45 PM, and it let it sit out for 24 hours, so then day 2 is tomorrow oct 25th at 7:45 PM and i let it sit out for 24 hours, and day 3 is sunday oct 26th, then if i let it sit out for 24 hours like it says, the 24 hours wouldn’t be up until 7:45 PM on sunday. so wouldn’t i have to wait until monday october 27th to add the 3 tbsp of flour and water in the morning and evening (even though technically monday would be day 4)? like i don’t know if this even makes any sense but what do i do here. because i can’t add the rest in the morning if the 24 hours isn’t up until 7:45 PM. i really don’t wanna mess this up. i’ve never made bread before let alone sourdough bread ",3,1761358625.0,Sourdough,9,1.0,False
1ofg1ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ofg1ww/house_rules_at_303/,House rules at 3:03,"I take the job because it pays too well and because I need to believe in easy luck again.

The listing says: “Quiet, no guests. Bring in parcels. Water fiddle-leaf fig on Tuesday. Do not enter the office.” Straight, black-and-white rules and a photo of a sunlit, white-brick ranch with twin magnolia trees reaching like patient hands.

At the key exchange, the owner doesn’t show. Instead there’s a package taped under the bench by the door, like a spy drop. Inside: a key, a neat note on thick paper.

Mara—
Thank you for your help.
Lights are on a schedule.
If the door chimes at night, don’t worry.
Do not enter the office.
—E. Thorne

There’s something smug about a note that assumes you’ll stay.

The house is bleached clean, like a hotel that wishes it were a monastery. A single mug on the drying rack. Throw blanket squared on the couch. The fiddle-leaf fig stands in the corner, leaves the size of frying pans, immaculate.

The layout is simple: living room, kitchen, a hallway with three doors—guest room, bathroom, the locked office—and stairs to a basement painted the gray of dishwater.

I do the ritual things: open the fridge, sniff the milk (fresh), check the stove (off), lift the rug corner (bare floor, no safe). I unload my backpack, text my sister that I got here fine, and feed my phone into a charging claw like a bird into a snare.

The door chimes at exactly 3:03 a.m.

It’s not a ring from the doorbell. It’s a thin, electronic tongue somewhere inside the house: three tones, ascending. I sit up in the guest bed, listening to the silence afterward, the way a kid waits after laughter to see if it belongs to them.

I tell myself it’s the smart thermostat. I tell myself a lot of things.

⸻

On the second day, a package arrives addressed to E. Thorne. The instructions say to bring parcels inside, so I do, but the weight is wrong, too heavy for its size. It sounds like someone filled it with sand.

I set it in the office doorway where I can pretend I’ve obeyed the line about “bring parcels in” without breaking the one about do not enter. The office door is new, smooth, slightly different wood than the others, with a lock that looks retrofitted. A metal keyhole, no keypad. I try the house key, because of course I do. It doesn’t turn.

The neighbor catches me on the lawn while I’m wrestling the trash to the curb. Tall, cool woman with navy nail polish and an HOA smile.

“You’re…?” She waits, like she can see the shape of my name hovering.

“House-sitting for Ms. Thorne,” I say. “Just for the week.”

“Oh.” She looks relieved, shoved next to wary. “Right. The week.”

“I’m Mara.”

“Deirdre,” she says, glancing over my shoulder at the door as if it has the next line. “If you need anything—well, the HOA doesn’t allow anything, but you can ask me anyway.” She lowers her voice. “If a man named Wes shows up? Do not open the door. Ex-husband. Restraining order. Very dramatic.”

“Got it.” I nod more convincingly than I feel. “Thank you.”

She leans in. “Are you…sleeping okay?”

“Sure,” I lie.

At 3:03 a.m., the tones rise again, three notes like a toy piano. I watch the hallway. The house breathes.

In the morning, there’s a cereal bowl in the sink.

I didn’t eat cereal.

⸻

Red herrings arrive like bills—steadily, with due dates implied.

There’s a click in the walls, then a scurrying. I imagine rats with car keys. I find a crayon under the couch and a child’s drawing in the junk drawer: a two-story house only this one is drawn sideways, like a map, with stick figures smiling in the walls. There’s a circular scorch mark on the garage floor, like someone set a hot cauldron down and forgot it. In the basement, scratches line the door to a storage room, low and ragged, as if a dog tried to dig through the wood.

Except there’s no dog. The instructions mention “Arlo,” but on the kitchen counter, an oval disc sleeps in a charging cradle—ARLO printed on the front. A robot vacuum. Don’t feed the Arlo. Cute.

The packages I haul inside get stranger. The heavy one holds sealed bags of activated charcoal pellets. Another is packed with replacement air filters. Someone is managing…air. I check the thermostat: a simple digital block humming, HOLD: 70°F. Under it, the carbon monoxide detector blinks green. That must be fine. Green is good. A little red stutters once, then back to green. Batteries, probably. Everything with a battery whines when it wants attention.

On the fourth day, I find thin women’s shoes tucked behind neatly lined boots. The boots are a size too small for me. I didn’t notice the shoes before. I tell myself I missed them, because that is easier than believing they’ve arrived.

And the toothbrush: blue, wet, standing in its glass like someone has just flicked their wrist.

If a stranger is staying inside the house, they are either the tidiest home invader in the state or I am being teased by someone who knows exactly how to braid a fear: one hair at a time, pulled just tight enough to move the skin.

⸻

I call the number in the note. No answer. I text: Hi, Ms. Thorne—just confirming I brought the parcels in. Do you need me to do anything else? A few seconds later, a bubble appears, then dissolves. Then: Thank you. Please don’t enter the office.

I type: Is everything okay? Delete. Instead: Understood.

A minute later: If the door chimes at night, don’t worry.

I’m not worried. I am a person who is very deliberately not worrying.

The office doorknob is cold. I put my ear to the wood and hear the rest of the house: the refrigerator’s small lung, the HVAC’s sleeping animal sigh. No footsteps. No scratching. The keyhole is old-fashioned enough to see through if there weren’t a tongue of metal blocking it. I get the idea to slide a paper under the door and poke a pin through the keyhole like in a movie, but the gap at the bottom is tight. If there’s a key on the other side, it is obediently in its place.

It isn’t Wes. I know that already. If an ex-husband were living in the walls, the house would smell more like cheap cologne and less like lemon oil and the inside of a new notebook.

Deirdre drops by with a covered dish. “I made too much,” she says, and I believe it; the casserole dish could feed three families. “And I wanted to check on you.”

“It’s very thoughtful.” I juggle it to the counter. “Do you know when Ms. Thorne is back?”

Deirdre pitches her voice low again. “It’s delicate. She’s had…trouble with being alone. And then she wasn’t alone. And then—well.” She gestures vaguely at the house, which takes the gesture like a compliment.

A yellow flyer catches my eye on a telephone pole when I take the trash out that night. HAVE YOU SEEN… The photo is a woman with dark hair and a generous, bored mouth, caught mid-blink. EVELYN THORNE, the flyer says beneath. CONTACT DETECTIVE REZEK with a number. The date at the bottom is six weeks ago.

My stomach does that empty swing—the elevator dropping while I stand still. Inside, on the foyer table, I notice for the first time the stack of mail rubber-banded together. Utilities. HOA. A medical bill with angry red type. On the top envelope, a yellow sticky note: Call.

The door chimes at 3:03 a.m., and I cry, ragged with exhaustion and too many explanations layered on each other like coats I can’t take off. I get up, go to the hallway, and say: “Okay. I hear you.”

There is warmth on the office doorknob, this time. As if someone just touched it from the other side.

⸻

The crawlspace reveals itself because I pull at the wrong part of the built-in shelves. Not in the office; the office stays shut like a mouth that knows what names can do to you. No, this is in the hall linen closet. Behind white towels folded with a ruler’s discipline, the back panel gives. A set of shallow shelves on hidden hinges swings out, revealing a knee-high dark gap.

I should call someone. The police? Deirdre? Detective Rezek whose number I copied from the flyer? Instead I get a flashlight app going and lower myself into dust.

The crawlspace runs along the hallway, disappearing behind the office wall. It’s not roomy enough to stand, but it’s dry, kept by the same obsession as the rest of the house. Someone has been back here, though. A flat pillow. A stack of bottled water. A book of crossword puzzles with neat, penciled-in squares. A plastic tub with protein bars and a battery radio.

And a phone charger plugged into an outlet—unswitched, humming, waiting.

I crawl along until I reach a mesh panel and peer through. On the other side, the office glows a dull gray—the kind of light you get from blackout curtains that leak around the edges. I can make out a desk, a chair, a shape that might be a cot. No movement. The air smells like…nothing. A purified emptiness.

I say, “Hello?”

A whisper of air answers. HVAC wakes and blows warm breath through the ducts. A small blinking LED inside the office winks: green, then red, then green again, like an eyelid trying to work out what duration means.

I back out fast enough to scrape my wrist. In the bathroom, I wash the blood—just a smear—from my skin. I look up and see her in the mirror.

Not her. Me. But the mirror startles me like a stranger. I don’t look enough like the photo on the flyer to make a scene. But the mouth—the mouth is the same.

“Sleep,” I tell myself out loud, because the body has to be bossed sometimes. “Sleep, and in the morning, the world makes sense again.”

At 3:03 a.m., the chime sounds, and then—faint under it—another sound, like a soft cough.

⸻

The police are a pair of tired men whose uniforms smell like coffee and car heater. I didn’t call 911. I called the non-emergency line and then a number on the flyer, and I used the voice I use with landlords and overconfident doctors and sweet old men who think “smile” is something you owe them. I made myself sound simple and harmless. I told them I was house-sitting and that things felt wrong.

“It’s probably the ex,” I say, because that’s the story the neighborhood has set out like a doormat. “Maybe he has a key.”

“Could be,” one of the cops says, the one with crinkled eyes. “Could be nothing, also. That happens more than you’d think. But we’ll take a look.”

They do the round. Check the basement. Shine a flashlight into the crawlspace and whistle softly in appreciation. “Hidden pantry,” he says, as if the word “hidden” can ever be purely fun.

At the office door, I expect them to pick the lock. They do not. “We’d need a warrant,” the crinkled-eyes one says, apologetic and not moving. “And the owner’s permission.”

“She’s missing,” I say.

“Reported missing,” he corrects. “That’s different.”

He gets on the radio. Says a name that sounds like “Rezeck,” which is close enough to make the hair on my forearms stand up.

When they leave, one of them turns back and says, “Ms. Thorne, if anything else seems off—”

“Mara,” I say automatically. “My name is Mara.”

He looks at me full-on then, like I’ve messed up his script. “Right,” he says. “Of course.”

After they go, I stand in the foyer where the notes and bills are. The sticky note on the medical bill says Call, but there’s another under it, paler, older, half the glue gone. Remember. Beneath that, an appointment card: E. THORNE – Memory Clinic – Cognitive Eval – 10:15 AM. Six weeks ago.

I sit down hard. The fiddle-leaf fig goes black at the edges of my vision and returns.

“Remember,” I say, and the word sounds like a password I can’t quite type correctly.

⸻

The house adjusts to me as if it has decided I am the fly it will let live because we are interesting to each other. Lights dim a beat after I give up on finding the switch. The thermostat goes to HOLD: 69°F when my hands chill. The robot vacuum Arlo parks itself at my bare toes and hums there, inexplicable as a cat.

I spend a morning on the front steps with the sun in my eyes, calling numbers on bills. I learn Evelyn Thorne hasn’t paid the gas company. I learn she scheduled the HVAC maintenance. I learn the doctor’s office reached her once and then not again. I learn her neighbor Deirdre’s first name is the only thing about her that’s casual.

I call the detective from the flyer. He says, “Ms. Thorne?”

“House-sitter,” I say. “Mara. I found a crawlspace.”

He sighs so quietly I hear the edge of it. “We’ve been through the property, ma’am. Twice. You just stay put. I’ll swing by.”

“What time?”

There’s a pause. “I was there last Tuesday,” he says, as if that counts for future tense.

I hang up. I decide not to be a person waiting for someone else to define my boundaries for me.

When you’ve been told a hundred times not to open a door, you begin to suspect the door opens a specific way, a way that justifies the warning. I take the key from under the bench again, and I lay out tools on the kitchen counter like it’s a surgical tray: bobby pin, flathead screwdriver, bread knife (because I’m reckless, not because it makes any sense).

The office door opens because the house unlocks it.

Not because I picked the lock—my bobby pin skittered on nothing and the bread knife just scratched paint. No—the latch gives with an audible click while my hand is nowhere near the knob. The concise, administrative soft click of a smart lock being told by god, Yes.

The office smells like paper warmed by electronics. The room is twilight even at noon: blackout curtains shut, a slice of light like a paper cut across the floor. Against the wall: a desk with a monitor sleeping, a second monitor showing a repeating feed of the front walk, the kitchen, the hallway—the house watching itself. In the corner: a narrow cot with a gray blanket folded tight.

There’s a corkboard above the desk. Papers pinned in a grid. A calendar with every day circled for the past two months. In the center, a Polaroid of me at the kitchen sink, laughing, my head tipped back as if someone just said something good. I don’t remember the laugh or the moment that earned it.

On the desk, a spiral-bound notebook opens to a page with three words written at the top in block letters: IF/THEN/ELSE. Beneath that: If door chimes at 3:03, Then wake up. If you are asleep, Else: trust the schedule. Like someone wrote logic in English and then abandoned the effort.

There’s a mirror on the inside of the office door, and because this is a house that enjoys a reveal, the mirror is angled to catch the corkboard and me at the same time. The word REMEMBER is written on the mirror in dry-erase marker. The letters are mine.

A desktop computer hums under the desk. I nudge the mouse. The screen wakes.

There are rules pinned to the desktop, digital notes:

— Don’t leave at night.
— Don’t open the windows.
— Do not sleep on the couch.
— Drink water.
— When you think you are “house-sitting,” read the file named YOU.

There’s a folder called YOU.

My hand moves without checking with me first, double-clicking. A video opens. The thumbnail is my face, shadowed, hair pushed back, taped over in places like I had been doing a home repair on myself.

“Hi,” the video-me says. The voice is tired, but steady. “It’s me. It’s you. It’s Evelyn. That’s your legal name. You keep wanting to call yourself other things. That’s okay. Mara is fine. It’s a name you gave yourself for when you want to be useful and not scared. But listen: you live here. You hired no one. You put up a fake listing because you didn’t want to be alone in a house that feels too quiet. You wanted to trick yourself into staying.”

My throat tightens. I watch her—me—blink.

“You went to the memory clinic. They said ‘post-concussive’ and ‘hypoxic insult’ and ‘you’re doing very well’ which is the kind of thing people say when they want your hope to be polite. There was a leak, Evelyn. Gas. Carbon monoxide. Slow bleed. You loved how much you slept. Then you started losing whole pockets of evening. You fixed it. The leak is fixed now. The filters are because you’re afraid—reasonably—of air. You made rules. So. If you’re watching this, and you think you’re house-sitting, please don’t leave. Please don’t go out at night. The chime at 3:03 is your alarm to wake up and drink water. You wake up and forget why. That’s why you wrote the notes. That’s why Arlo says his name.”

The video cuts; another starts automatically. Me, closer to the camera. “Deirdre knows. She’ll hand you a casserole because she doesn’t know what to do with the part where she wanted to call 911 and didn’t. Detective Rezek has a list of people reported missing; you are on it because you stopped returning calls for three days when your phone died. Your ex-husband is not real; you never married. The restraining order is against a hedge trimmer company that kept leaving flyers. The scratches at the basement door are from the moving guys and the dog that didn’t move in. The crawlspace is yours. You built it. Because sleeping in the office made you feel watched but sleeping in the hallway made you feel safe. All of this is yours. That includes the fear. That includes your real name.”

I stop the video. I sit in the chair and put my head down on the desk like a child who pouted too long.

The office wall clock says 3:02 and the door chimes and I am already awake for once, thank god, and I say out loud, “I hear you,” and I drink the water on the desk that someone—me—left exactly where I would reach for it.

The house waits. The air tastes like itself, which is to say like nothing.

⸻

After that, the red herrings don’t stop being red, but they stop being fish I have to chase.

I see the char on the garage floor and find a file on the desktop labeled GRILL DISASTER with a screenshot of a burning grill from three houses down and a note: Not you. Don’t steal other people’s catastrophes. I find the child’s drawing and flip it over and there’s a note in block letters: LUCAS (Deirdre’s kid) — THANK YOU FOR WATERING PLANT. I pull the low drawer in the kitchen that sticks and find a stack of “No Soliciting” signs with test cuts in them, where I practiced how to shape letters.

But the house still has corners that are different to me depending on the hour. At noon, the hallway is just a hallway; at night, it is a throat. In the afternoon, the office is an office; at three in the morning, it is a station on a train to somewhere I’ll never arrive.

I watch the front camera on the second monitor and see myself leave the house twice: once carrying a bag of charcoal pellets to the curb and once carrying myself back after picking up a prescription that the pharmacy said was ready under Thorne, Evelyn. The motion alert thumbnails catch my hair from angles I don’t recognize and give them back to me as evidence that I have been here the whole time.

When Detective Rezek finally comes, he stands in the doorway in a jacket that gapes slightly at the chest, skin flushed from the cold.

“Ms. Thorne,” he says, careful.

“Hi,” I say. “I called you.”

He looks over my shoulder at the desk, at the monitors, at the mirror with its reminder, at me with my newly memorized mouth. What he wants is for me to declare a victory that absolves him of missing me while I lived in plain sight. What I want is to make an apology that will put a ribbon on the days I can’t account for. We settle for polite.

“We get a lot of these,” he says quietly. “Not…this exactly. But close.”

“People losing their names in their own houses,” I say.

“People trying to make rooms into rules,” he says. “If you need anything—if it gets bad again—call.”

I nod. He takes a step back like the house has moved under his feet.

“What time is it?” I ask him, and he gives me the exact minute and my brain whirrs and accepts it even though I knew I was asking because I wanted to test my own accuracy.

“3:03?” I say, smiling without meaning to.

He glances at the hallway like it might sing.

I close the office door behind him and feel the soft lock find its home.

⸻

That night, I sleep on the couch even though I told myself not to. I fall asleep to a rerun of a cooking show where nobody loses anything they can’t re-season. I wake—because the house has taught me how to—and the clock says 3:03, and the chime sounds like a spoon on a glass, calling for a toast.

This time there is a second sound with it. Movement on the stairs.

I sit up, heart in my throat, but not panicking. It’s the sort of calm that knows how to sprint.

“He-hello?” I try. The shape is at the bend in the stairs, tall, held together by a coat.

“Don’t be afraid,” the shape says.

I reach for the lamp and turn it on.

It’s me, reflected in the black TV screen: my own shape on the couch, my own coat on the banister from earlier, my own breathing the only moving thing. I leave the lamp on and the TV off, and I listen to the heater, the fridge, the house politely being alive.

You can’t hold a twist in your hands. You can only hold what it turns.

Here is what the turning leaves me with: I took a job because it paid too well. The job was mine already. The owner of the house I’m house-sitting for is still here. That sentence used to terrify me. Now I say it like a promise.

I am the owner. I am still here.

In the morning, the sun cuts a neat rectangle on the office floor. Deirdre waves from her driveway with a motion that says she can breathe, too. I water the fiddle-leaf fig because it is Tuesday. I bring in the packages—filters, more filters—and stack them in the office doorway like a person who understands that air can be something you maintain.

When the door chimes that night, I wake, drink water, and tell the house, “I hear you,” and the house answers in its three bright notes, like a name I’m learning how to keep.",2,1761358602.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1offy9l,https://i.redd.it/batx5xrh26xf1.jpeg,HELP WITH SOURDOUGH PLEASE,"Hi! So, for an assignment for one of my classes (the gut microbiome) at uni, we have to make sourdough bread. In the picture I included the instructions for the first 3 steps (but that's not what i have a question on but read it and you'll see what I mean). It is currently 8:10 pm and I just started step 1 for day 1 at 7:45 PM. it tells me to let it sit out on the counter at room temperature for 24 hours. so that means tomorrow at 7:45 PM (for day 2) i will add the 3 Tbsp flour + 3 Tbsp filtered water, and then stir and let sit at room temperature for 24 hours. however if you notice it says on day 3 to add add 3 Tbsp flour + 3 Tbsp filtered water in the MORNING and stir and let it sit out at room temp for 12 hours. and then do the exact same in the evening. so my question is, if day one is today oct 24th at 7:45 PM, and it let it sit out for 24 hours, so then day 2 is tomorrow oct 25th at 7:45 PM and i let it sit out for 24 hours, and day 3 is sunday oct 26th, then if i let it sit out for 24 hours like it says, the 24 hours wouldn’t be up until 7:45 PM on sunday. so wouldn’t i have to wait until monday october 27th to add the 3 tbsp of flour and water in the morning and evening (even though technically monday would be day 4)? like i don’t know if this even makes any sense but what do i do here. because i can’t add the rest in the morning if the 24 hours isn’t up until 7:45 PM. i really don’t wanna mess this up. i’ve never made bread before let alone sourdough bread ",2,1761358288.0,SourdoughStarter,3,1.0,False
1offy1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodySwapMemes/comments/1offy1o/amelia_breaks_the_news_part_five/,Amelia breaks the news (part five),"*[Amelia dons a transformation suit as a bioform operator in order to live on behalf of her client, Logan- a recent lottery winner with the will of a rock.  During this day in her life, she’s gotten his coffee, worked his job, and even braved a hoarder house so he doesn’t have to.  This one is lengthy- sorry!- I’ll have the conclusion up soon.]*

Before facing Actual Logan, I like to make a list of everything I enjoy about being him.  After all, in one day I’ve already made him a pariah and a roundabout orphan.  There’s going to be some blowback.  He won’t kick me off payroll, however; there’s no one to replace me. 

Surely other bioform operators exist, but I’ve never met one.  

I want to.  

How am I supposed to talk about this job with anyone?  

Co-workers can bitch about bad bosses or stagnation in their company.  Who do I go to and say, “Hey, I dove headfirst into a mountain of student loan debt just so I could trade my pumps and size-four skirt for an XXL pair of sweats and New Balances.  I don’t put on lipstick for work; I put on the body of a man completely dissimilar to my own.  Half my days are spent staving off embarrassing erections, and I still can’t name more than three comic book franchises”?

By the way, the embarrassing erections are on the list.  Just not the *embarrassing* part.  It’s weird.  I have Logan’s appetite but not his taste.  It’s not as if I’m salivating my way around dick-first in search of the nearest hole, but man, would it be nice to use this thing.  The problem is that my sex selection pool is limited.  All too often I look like Logan, for one, and when I’m myself I recoil at the thought of explaining to a date, “Hi, your prospective girlfriend has a dick for eight hours a day.  Can I by any chance put it inside of you?”

It throws my sexuality into a tailspin.  I’m a straight, cisgendered woman.   I’d like to become a mother.   I want to end my days wrapped in the warm, protective arms of a man who loves me.  Someone I respect and adore.  But then, if I look in the mirror on the average business day, I’m a guy.  I’m comfortable enough in my femininity not to lose it after a few temporary biological changes during work hours; it just isn’t conducive to dating.  And I hate that.

You could even say it makes me flaccid.

Just kidding.  I’m already flaccid!

My own absurdity makes me giggle.

There are other things on my list.

When I’m Logan, I’m strong.  

Jar opening strong.  

Box-lifting strong.

If someone assaults me on the street, I’ll have more of a fighting chance as a three-hundred-pound dude rather than a 120-pound woman.

I feel safer.

And no one gawks at me.  No one really even notices me ~~unless they think I’m a pervert~~.

Honestly, it’s a solid list.  Enjoying Logan’s body- mass, manhood, and muscle- does not detract by one iota from my identity as a woman.  I love my true self- my flexibility, dexterity, and my proclivity to nurture and be nurtured.   Both things can be true.  My uniform is another person’s appearance, but the sense of who I am is my own.  

Well, most of the time.

I just wish I could find someone else who could understand.

Anyway.  Right now I’m waddling my way from Mother’s Hoarder House of Horrors over to Logan’s.

The walk back is short, but it feels endless.  Each step drags the day’s failures behind it.  I should have resisted the urge to compliment a woman while staring at her chest.  (I still can’t believe I was so thoughtless.)  I probably should not have agreed to this double shift either, and I *definitely* should not have promised to uphold Logan’s duties as a “disappointment” of a son.

But Logan deserves the truth.

So I arrive at another mistake waiting to happen.  I’m at Logan’s place.  

I open the door and walk into a frustrating scene: the place is littered with food wrappers and abandoned drinks.  Beside the couch sits what I’m *pretty sure* is Logan’s cum sock.  Johnny Bravo is still on.

I don’t want to know any more details.

Logan calls from the sofa, “How did dinner go?”

“It didn’t happen.”

Logan jumps to attention, “WHAT!  Why not??”

Initially he seems curious.  He sent me on an errand.  An emotionally traumatic errand, but I always complete my work.  His shock is both a compliment and a harbinger of discord.

I impart the bad news.  “Because I left.”

His voice is tense.  Veins slowly form at the top of his crown.  Logan’s brow furrows like two black caterpillars racing toward his nose.  “Why did you leave?”

The thing about Logan is that his modus operandi is self-loathing.  So much so that he’s hired another person to *be* him.  I don’t want to crack open the can of worms that is his childhood adversity as the very man he despises.  I just want to talk to him human to human.  I want to talk to him as myself.

“Hm?”  he pushes.

I hesitate.  “…Logan, can I just talk to you as me for a sec?  Girl to guy?”

His face goes cold.  I’ve pressed a button somewhere.

“No.”

“No?  Why?”

“Because, Amelia.”

He rolls his eyes as if I’m an idiot for even asking.

“You’re… hot.  And happy.  You spend eight hours as me-“

“Sixteen today-“ I correct.

“You spend eight hours *normally*,  and then you peel that costume off and go enjoy your own life.  I don’t get to do that.  This,” he grabs his gut for emphasis, “stays.  All the bullshit you put up with for me?  That’s mine.  I don’t need you throwing it all in my face.”

“Logan-”

“No.”

“Look… please, just let me talk to you?  I want you to know that you’re talking to another person.  Someone who believes that you matter.  I want you to see *me* seeing you, you know?”

“Let me ask you this, Amelia.  How would you feel if you were *me*?  Always me, and you couldn’t just step out of *that* at the end of the day?“ he gestures to my body; rather, a convenient imitation of *his* body.  “You think you’re- what?- giving me a kindness?”

He mocks me, “*Er, I want you to see me*.  Fuck you.”

“I…” can’t argue with him.  My life begins again every evening at five.  Every weekend, aside from the occasional Saturday shift, is one spent frolicking around in my own skin.  I know this.  He knows this.  So he continues.

“And you can’t even tell me why you didn’t have dinner with my mom without begging to be let out.”

He stares long and hard.  We’re locked in.  Until, that is, his stare pierces through me and I break.  He has me clocked.

I look down at my hands.  They’re massive.  My legs?  Practically spilling out of these pants.  And yet, I don’t care.  Not really.  And I don’t care because they aren’t actually mine.  

Sometimes I feel protective of Logan.  Sure, I can mentally criticize him, and he dishes it out as well (unprovoked, as far as he’s concerned).  He laughs at what a loser he thinks I am, with my joke of an art degree, a couple of acting classes to fulfill my occasional compulsion to be anyone but myself- even if that “anyone” is a fat guy with greasy hair and a belly bulging toward the floor.  But *Logan and I* can do that.  Like siblings.  

Maybe it makes me a hypocrite (it totally makes me a hypocrite) but seeing someone else kick him around makes my blood boil.  He doesn’t deserve to be treated the way that he is.   And I want to offer him genuine validation *as myself*.  Not because I dislike being him- I have my list!- but because I don’t know how many other people have looked him in the eyes and acted like they give a shit.

My reverie is cut short by the sudden realization that half of those “inside thoughts” have made their way out of my mouth and into this discussion.

Shit.  Shitshitshit.

Luckily for me, it takes an asshole to know an asshole, so Logan lets it slide.

“Fucking hell, Amelia.  I swear someday I’m going to make you stay in that suit for a week straight.”

I smile, “Well then I’ll get to be the big swinging dick around here.”

Logan flashes the faintest smile on the planet, gone as quickly as it came, “Yeah, we’ll see about that.  Go change in the bedroom.  And hey, try not to lecture me too much.”

He turns back toward the TV.

With Logan’s blessing, I step into the bedroom in order to remove the suit and return as Me.

While changing , the transformative powers of the suit yield the most intense physical sensations I’ve ever experienced.  They come in waves.  As I unravel from Logan’s body, my bones, muscles, and organs shift and reconfigure, stretching and contracting, every inch of me becomes an erogenous zone.  My chromosomes rethread, my skin becomes my own, and an orgasmic tremor of release pulses through me, anchoring me fully in my own form once again.

This is one reason I never change at Logan’s.

The suit drops to the floor, a lifeless garment until it envelops its host.  I don’t need a mirror, I already know.  Once more, I am Amelia.

The first few seconds since the change are jarring.  I re-stabilize my balance.  My slender hands run down my body as I reacquaint myself with soft curves.  A small waist.  Round hips.  Smooth skin.  Every touch is a quiet celebration of being myself again.

Logan’s oversized t-shirt and sweatpants are the closest thing to modesty available.  For now, I drape them over my comparatively slight frame, holding them up to my body for dear life.  It’s okay, they’ll fit again once I return to the suit.  Now it’s time to get back to Logan.

He blushes.  He hasn’t seen me *as* me in months.  Logan shifts uncomfortably as I take a seat next to him; I scoot over to give him some more room and regale him with my tales of broken TV’s and motherhood misery.

“Okay,” I sigh, “So… I went inside and knocked something down.  Did you know your mom is a hoarder?”

“Yeah.  Always has been.”

“You didn’t tell me.”

My voice is small.  Like I’m about to sing him a lullaby, but dammit, someone has to.  (I don’t really.  That would be odd.)

My tale continues, my words picking up faster and faster, “So I walked in and I bumped into something, and when I went to catch it I broke something, and then I jumped into something else and it was like every time I moved, something new was getting destroyed.  And then your mom hurled a litany of abuse my way and she called me…- Logan, your mom is mean.”

“Yeah, I know she’s mean.  She’s always been mean.  You can’t handle someone being mean to you for a little while?”  I take it that Logan is not receptive to “Yo’ Mama” jokes because he’s getting angry at me for answering a question, but I get it.  He has an insult up his sleeve for me as well, “Shows what a damn princess you are.”

I brush it off.  He’s defensive but, once again, he deserves to know.

“But she’s mean to *you*.  And she says things that aren’t true.”

“Well, that’s my life.  You’re not supposed to question it, you’re just supposed to deal with it for me.  That’s your job.”

“I know.  But… I take away the plastic, right?  I do your job, I run your errands, I clean your house.  All of this frees you up to do whatever you want. You can do *anything*.  Don’t you want to see the real world?  To live?  I mean you won the lottery and had a house built, but you never even leave this place and-“

“-And What I do with my time is not for you to dictate.  *Stay in your lane*.”

“I just don’t want to be a bandaid, you know?”

“*Be careful.*”   He’s so tense he might as well be growling at me.  

I probably shouldn’t poke the beast, but knowing when to stop is not my forte.  “I’ve been doing this for so long.  Logan, you can have a good life.  I’m not going to be here forever.”

“Are you quitting on me?” He snorts, “Like everyone else.”

“No.  I want to help you live your own life, because it’s worth living.”

I go on to dump half formed ideas about all the ways in which we can Fix All The Things.  Honestly, I’m annoying myself at this point too.  “I can do all of the boring stuff and… and we can take walks together!  Get healthy.  Of course, we can have the suit readjusted accordingly and- Logan, we can bro out!  We can go to Oktoberfest in Munich and Carnival in Spain!  I’ll be you, I don’t care, it’ll be fun!  And your art!  I can help you get that out and-“

Logan booms, “I TOLD you not to mention that again!  Go put the suit back on.  Your break is over.”

So I do.  And I clean, return his emails, and organize his closet.  Meanwhile, Logan finds somewhere else to sit, doing nothing, becoming nothing.

I can’t force him to thrive or live a life he doesn’t want- and I have to make sure that I don’t start dying in his place.  His resignation can’t be my purpose.",2,1761358268.0,BodySwapMemes,0,1.0,False

But in reality? Most of us hit snooze 5 times, scroll half-asleep through TikTok in bed, then spiral into shame because we missed the ""golden morning productivity window"" again.  
No wonder so many people just give up on becoming a morning person. It feels impossible, unnatural, maybe even pointless.

But here's what surprised me: Most of us are *not* lazy or broken. We're fighting against a mix of social chaos (like hustle culture, bad sleep habits passed down from family, or late-night screen addiction), biological wiring (chronotype mismatches), and viral internet advice that doesn't actually work.  
I dove deep into real science, actual expert advice, and long-form content (books, podcasts, behavioral science research). Not the recycled 5AM Club TikTok bro-takes.

This post is your no-fluff playbook to actually make early mornings doable—and even enjoyable. No guilt, just tools.

---

1. **Know your chronotype first**  
Not everyone is wired to wake up at 5AM. Dr. Michael Breus, sleep expert and author of *The Power of When*, categorizes people into 4 chronotypes—lion, bear, wolf, dolphin. You might be naturally inclined to focus earlier or later in the day.  
Start here before forcing a schedule that works against your biology. You can take his free quiz online.

2. **Forget motivation, build identity habits**  
James Clear (*Atomic Habits*) breaks this down best: ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."" Instead of “I want to wake up early,” shift to “I’m someone who wakes up early.” Then back it up with tiny consistent cues.  
Even brushing your teeth right after waking can be a signal to move into your new identity.

3. **Light before coffee**  
Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) has emphasized repeatedly: get sunlight in your eyes (not through a window) within 30 minutes of waking. This regulates your circadian clock and boosts cortisol *at the right time*, making you naturally alert earlier.  
10 minutes of direct sunlight in the morning is more powerful than melatonin at night.

4. **Make your mornings dopamine-rich**  
This one changed everything. Instead of forcing yourself through a cold, miserable morning routine, design it around things that make you feel good.  
Listen to an inspiring podcast. Make a coffee you look forward to. Go for a short walk and listen to music that hypes you up. Reward your brain early.  
As Dr. Anna Lembke (author of *Dopamine Nation*) explains, dopamine is not just about pleasure—it’s about *motivation to act*. Use that.

5. **Use the 90-minute sleep cycle hack**  
Sleep follows a 90-minute rhythm. Waking up in the middle of deep sleep = groggy zombie. Apps like Sleep Cycle or Oura Ring track your sleep and wake you up at the lightest point within a 30-minute window. Waking up mid-light sleep = refreshed, not wrecked.

6. **No screens 1 hour before bed, no phone in the room**  
Blue light kills melatonin. But it’s not just that. “Revenge bedtime procrastination” (scrolling as emotional rebellion against your day) is real.  
The solution: put your phone in another room. Use a real alarm clock. Or use an app like *One Sec* that adds a delay every time you open a social app, interrupting your autopilot doom-scroll.

7. **BeFreed: my secret weapon for learning while half-asleep**  
So here’s what helped me *want* to wake up: BeFreed. It’s this insanely smart AI-powered learning app built by Columbia grads. It turns expert research, best-selling books, and lectures into short audio lessons tailored to your goals.  
You can pick 10, 20, or 40-minute podcasts depending on your mood. AND choose your host’s voice (mine sounds like a sarcastic meditation teacher). It learns from what you listen to and builds a personalized learning path over time.  
They have a huge library on productivity, sleep, psychology—you name it. I start every morning learning something inspiring. It makes me excited to get out of bed. Highly recommend.

8. **Read this book: *Why We Sleep* by Matthew Walker**  
This book will blow your mind. Written by a UC Berkeley neuroscientist, it’s a NYT bestseller and has changed how thousands of people think about rest.  
Walker breaks down the science of REM, deep sleep, and why waking up at the same time every day (even weekends) is non-negotiable for brain performance.  
Warning: after reading it, you’ll never brag about “grinding on 4 hours of sleep” again. This is the best sleep science book I’ve ever read. Period.

9. **Podcast rec: Huberman Lab**  
Dr. Andrew Huberman’s episodes on sleep, circadian rhythms, and morning routines are gold. He explains why caffeine timing matters (spoiler: wait 90 minutes after waking), and which habits actually move the needle.  
Especially listen to his episode “Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert When Awake.”

10. **YouTube channel: Matt D’Avella**  
His videos on building better habits, minimalist routines, and experimenting with sleep changes are super well-researched and easy to binge.  
He actually *tries* the habits for 30 days and shows the results. Way more helpful than listicle-style advice.

For the majority of my adulthood, I worked full time in the film and tv industry as a props builder/buyer. However, in February of 2023 (coincidentally the same day my mom passed from cancer) I, along with many of my friends and colleagues, lost my career due to the industry strikes. I pivoted into stagehand work and eventually art dept/installation builds for music festivals around the country, which is where I met my partner. For the past two years, we’ve travelled the country with our little cat, Cecil, building some pretty neat stuff. During the off season we settle down in a comfortable spot (usually west coast or NOLA) and pick up local work. I usually take work in cocktail bars as cocktailing is one of my passions. I love making sketches and hand drawn postcards of my daily life, travels, and recipes that I’d love to share with my new friends. I was born in US but my mom was from Brazil. I speak English, Portuguese, and Spanish.

Mario criss-crossed his way over the rainbow bridge today. (Ol’ Spaghetti Legs was one of many nicknames my husband and I had for him.)

Mario was a bottle-fed kitten that I couldn’t give up. I loved him from the moment I first saw his little ears flutter to the moment I held him for the last time. 

We also warmly nicknamed him ‘Mario SlowWagon’ (REO Speedwagon reference that probably only makes sense to us.) This was due to Mario’s favorite activity of lying down on his side, getting out the claws and dragging his body across the carpet because walking is for losers.

We had to hide the shaving cream from him because he liked licking it off the can, and that was weird. And he did love attempting to bury my coffee cups…while filled with liquid…and kicking it across the room (two deposits we didn’t get back thanks to Mario-stained walls.)

He was also once beaten up by a chinchilla. 

But seriously, Mario was my little guy. He was an absolute sweetheart that brought a lot of sunshine into our lives. 

I’m so grateful to my husband and the wonderful veterinarians who helped him transition to his new life.

1offknn,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1offknn/project_eden/,Project Eden,"“Wake up,” said my Mother, gently rocking me as I’m awoken by the golden light of the sun. I opened my eyes and blinked once, twice as my eyes slowly adjusted to the shocking light.

 ""I made you pancakes, Dickie,” Mother informed me.

Still half-asleep, I dragged myself out of bed as I kept trying to wake up, the golden aroma of pancakes wafting up my nose. I started to pick up my pace slowly as the aroma of pancakes encouraged me to keep moving faster. I sat down, fork in hand. I was ready to destroy these symmetrical pucks of syrupy goodness.



“You have school today,” informed Mother. “I ironed your uniform crisply  and placed your lunch in your bag.”

I nodded, still chewing my perfect pancakes that always tasted the same, not that I’m complaining. With the last bite of the same, syrupy pancakes, I put on the same crisped, starched uniform with the same ivory buttons that are always spotless. I zipped up my pristine emerald tie up to my collarbone. The dark shiny black loafers that have been neatly polished presumably by Mother. I picked up my neat leather coffee colored suitcase filled with all my school work and supplies and opened it, checking to see if I had everything.

“DICKIE!” Mother called, “I see the bus turning into the driveway, I think it's best for you to leave soon.” 



I raised my voice, “Yes, Mother,” snapping the suitcase closed, suddenly woken by the call. I walked out to the school bus and hopped inside, and sat in the nearest seat. The sound of tires on the concrete road almost lulled me into sleep. The quietness was interrupted, time and time again by the soft click of the turn signal. The bus lurched forward as it went to a complete stop in front of David Jaffe Middle School. The hallways were made of smooth as glass material, giving it a futuristic and perfect look that I enjoyed and I strolled into my first period class, History.   
  
  


	“Your homework assignments on the friendship of Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth.”  Ms Abginaile  informed the class, “Since we are starting the Boston Tea Party.”   
I already wanted to fall asleep but it felt like getting perfect grades were ingrained in my brain.  
“The British and the Americans during that time were negotiating and decided to talk about the taxes over a cup of tea.” Ms Abginaile droned on. “And alas everything was resolved without a hiccup and a spot of tea telling us that violence is not the answer.”   
  
	“Violence.” I repeated to myself. I had never heard of that word before and yet it tickled my mind. I suddenly looked up from my desk determined to raise up my hand to ask about what that word meant but the teacher looked visibly shaken and I decided right now, wasn’t the best time to ask. The bell rang. It was lunch, my stomach yearned for some food but before I chowed down on my usual ham and cheese sandwich, I needed to find out what violence meant. I had a feeling that this word wouldn’t be in the library and instead I decided to use the school's computer lab to find out what this word meant.  
  
	I walked into the perfectly cleaned library with its cozy paper-like smell of the books. I walked curiously straight over to the  metallic computer, pressed the button and it quickly whirred to life. I typed in Loogle using my keyboard, V Y L E N C E. Did you mean violence? Loogle asked. I clicked it. There were links after links about the wars happening in the world, the people crushed, killed and left homeless and vagrant and all the psychopathic things that happened. It felt like a switch in my brain and everything started to come together, why Ms Abignaile was so concerned about this word “Violence.”   
“Dickie Pax, report to the main office immediately.” The announcements abruptly blared but as I walked slowly my thoughts were jumbled, thinking about how I didn’t know about this sooner, trudging along to the office. Inside the office, “Sit right down, Pax.” Two scientists in uniform informed me, “Just relax and let your mind melt away.” pointing at a small, pill shaped thing to my head.   
  
“Wake up” said my Mother, gently rocking me as I’m awoken by the artificial light of the sun. Everything feels perfect.

my new friends know i have ME/CFS but i dont think they can really comprehend it since all im showing them is the bubbly optimistic side of myself that says “don’t worry if my knees are giving out/ im forgetting everything you tell me/ or i zone out and blank ‘cause it could always be worse” and always smiles and laughs as i say it. but the truth is im desperate for support. i haven’t yet completed my disability support forms because i keep telling myself i dont need it and that there are people who really do. 

the truth of it is i cant keep going anymore, something is just going to remove this facade ive constructed, be it attendance, deadlines, or chores and i just don’t know how im going to recover from it. 

I just keep thinking to myself that i could have it so much worse and that i should be grateful my ME/CFS is mild. just being able to go uni is something im so proud of myself for and moving out was a huge risk but i just keep telling myself that if i fake it and make it and get my degree then i can say that im normal. because although im only mild im desperate to not be held back by this condition. 

im sorry for venting and this longwinded post but please give me any recommendations for studying chores etc because i feel like if i dont change something now then eventually there’ll be a straw that breaks the camels back and i desperately want to finish and enjoy uni.

Cute at first until her group of twelve slowly migrated onto my side. The property line is a straight fence replaced last year, but their mats kept inching under it and then around it onto my lawn, like ivy with Lululemons. By week three they were fully setting up on my grass because, her words, the lot line is just an idea and the whole cul-de-sac is shared nature. She brought a bluetooth speaker for whale sounds, lit incense that drifted straight into my kitchen, and rang a bell at 6:02 a.m. sharp while I was trying to drink coffee and pretend it wasn’t happening.

I asked her to keep it on her side and got a condescending talk about community vibes and how my lawn is unused during that hour. I put in writing that they do not have permission to be on my property. The next week they were back, now with two folding tables for lemon water set up on my patio pavers. So I turned on my sprinklers. Not blasting, just the normal zone cycle my system runs at 6:05. Half the class shrieked, one slipped, nobody got hurt. I told them they were trespassing and to leave. Neighbor called me dramatic and posted on our neighborhood app that I assaulted seniors with water. That post magically omitted the part where they were on my side of the fence.

I installed motion sprinklers on the inside of the fence line and a small sign that says private property no classes. She responded by moving her mats right up to the heads and daring me to do it again because the city encourages outdoor wellness. The following weekend she brought a portable amp. I called the non emergency line for the noise and for trespassing. The officer asked them to move back to her yard and told her to knock it off with the music before 8 a.m. She went nuclear, told the officer we are in a drought and I’m wasting precious water to bully seniors. Then she filed a complaint with our HOA that my sprinklers are a nuisance. I sent the HOA videos of her group stepping through my gate to refill water and standing on my patio during savasana. The HOA issued her a warning for using common areas without approval and also sent me a courtesy notice to avoid confrontations and keep irrigation within posted hours. Cool.

Last weekend she tried a loophole and put her class on my front lawn strip between sidewalk and street, claiming it’s public right of way. They laid mats across my driveway apron while I was leaving for work. I rolled my window down and said I needed to back out. She told me to wait five minutes for intention setting. I backed out slowly with my backup camera, nobody was close, but two people slapped my trunk as if I’d tried to run them over. I drove straight to city code enforcement with timestamps, her Eventbrite page, and the HOA letter. The city told her she needs a permit for recurring classes, can’t block driveways, and to stop using amplified sound before 8 a.m. She showed up at my door after, shaking mad, saying I embarrassed her, cost her students, and made her cry. Then she sent an invoice for two ruined yoga mats from the sprinklers and asked me to Venmo her forty dollars.

Now our block is split between people who like free yoga and people who like property lines. Half the time someone is giving me side eye at the mailbox. My spouse says I should have ignored it, closed the blinds, and let them stretch until they got bored. I feel like if you let one class move onto your lawn at 6 a.m., you’ll be hosting goat yoga on your roof by fall. Am I overreacting for documenting everything, using motion sprinklers on my own grass, and looping in the HOA and city, or is my neighbor wildly out of line calling my yard shared nature and turning my driveway into a studio?",2,1761356766.0,AmIOverreacting,12,0.67,False

1offfft,https://youtu.be/6MbbFrMjnSE,4 Very Scary TRUE Creepy Tourist Trap Horror Stories,"# ""No Refunds"":

I had been driving all day, southbound toward family in Mississippi, when my car started rattling like loose change in a washing machine. Memphis was the nearest place to pull off, and I was tired enough to settle for anything that wasn’t the side of the highway. I spotted a budget motel with a buzzing neon sign that flickered more dead than alive. “Rooms Available.” The letters struggled to stay lit, like they wanted to warn me instead.

The parking lot looked mostly abandoned. Paint peeled from the doors. Only three cars sat in the lot, scattered like nobody wanted to park too close to anyone else. It wasn’t inviting. It didn’t have to be. I just needed a night.

Inside the office, a dusty fan pushed warm air around a cramped room. Behind the counter stood a man who looked carved out of cigarette smoke and bad sleep. Gray hair, stained shirt, eyes that felt like they were waiting for something.

“Evening,” he said, monotone. “Need a room?”

“Just for tonight,” I answered. “How much?”

“Forty. Cash only.” He slid a brass key across the counter. “Room twelve. Quiet back there.”

I pulled out the bills. “Anywhere to eat around here?”

He paused longer than necessary. “No. Best to stay in. Streets get rough after dark.”

He said it like a rule, not advice. The way his eyes held on mine made my skin tighten. I nodded anyway and walked to my room.

Everything about Room 12 felt wrong the second the door groaned open. The stale air slapped me in the face—mold, something sour, like time had rotted in here. The light flickered overhead, revealing a thin mattress, sagging chair, and carpet that stuck to my shoes like spilled soda. Stains everywhere. Shadows clinging to corners.

My phone buzzed. Emily.

“Made it as far as Memphis,” I told her. “Car’s acting up. Found a cheap place for the night.”

“Lock the door and don’t leave it,” she warned. “I mean it.”

Once we hung up, the smell seemed to thicken, seep into me. I checked the bathroom. Nothing but a dripping faucet and a shower curtain that looked like it had witnessed crimes.

Then came the sound. A faint scrape under the bed. Metal on metal. I jumped.

Probably old pipes, I told myself. This place was ancient. Everything groaned.

By nine, I couldn’t take the air inside anymore. I stepped outside. A woman pushing a cleaning cart stopped when I called to her. Her eyes were tired, her hair pulled back tight like she couldn’t let anything loose here.

“My room smells awful,” I said. “Like something died.”

She stiffened. “Plumbing. Happens sometimes.” She quickly handed me a can of air freshener. “Use this.”

Her hand trembled a little. She turned away fast, like conversation was dangerous.

The spray only made the room smell like dead flowers. The scrape returned. Closer. Like something shifting position beneath me. My chest tightened with the kind of dread that doesn’t need logic.

Finally, I dropped to the floor and lifted the hanging blanket. My phone flashlight revealed filth, dust, darkness. Then a patch. Darker than the carpet. A stain. The smell poured up and filled my lungs.

I choked, stumbling back.

I marched to the office. The manager looked annoyed, like I had interrupted a good time.

“The smell is worse,” I said. “And something is under the bed. Scratching.”

“Rats.” He said it too fast. “Old building.”

“That isn’t rats. I want another room.”

He shook his head. “All booked. You can leave if you want. No refund.”

There was no concern. Just… indifference. He watched me like he was deciding whether to lock the door behind me.

I returned to the room but locked everything I could. Chair under the handle. I sat fully dressed on the bed, every noise making my stomach twist. The clock read 11:58 when footsteps approached. Slow. Deliberate. They stopped right outside my door.

I held my breath. The handle stayed still, but someone stood there. Listening. Waiting. After a long minute, the footsteps faded into silence.

That was when I knew I wasn’t safe here.

I grabbed my bag, keys in my shaking hand. As I reached for the door, a heavy thud hit from beneath the bed. Not a scratch. Not a rat. Something with weight.

I lifted the blanket again despite every instinct screaming not to. The flashlight beam caught fabric… torn and soaked dark brown. The smell flooded my head. Something was wedged inside the metal frame. Something bigger than a rat.

I didn’t look longer.

I ran. Out the door. Across the lot. Behind me, the cleaning woman stood motionless, clutching her cart, eyes wide like she knew exactly what I had discovered.

“What is under that bed?” I demanded.

She swallowed hard. “You need to go. Please. Do not ask questions here.”

Her voice wasn’t dismissing me. It was pleading.

I left. I drove until the road blurred and my hands ached from gripping the wheel. Found a hotel miles away. Locked myself in and didn’t sleep.

Days later, the news came. Authorities searched the motel. A missing woman had been found under the bed in Room 12, shoved into the hollow frame. She had been there more than a month. The manager knew. Guests complained. He kept renting the room anyway.

The cleaning woman had suspected, but fear kept her silent.

I still hear that scraping in my dreams. That room was never meant to keep travelers safe. It was meant to bury them.

I was lucky I only stayed one night.





# ""The Killer Never Left"":

I always thought those murder-house attractions were just cash grabs for adrenaline junkies. A spooky sign, a tragic backstory, maybe a few staged creaks. That was my mindset in 2014 when Alex and Chris convinced me to spend the night at the Villisca Axe Murder House in Iowa. We were all in our mid-thirties, bored with the same weekends, ready to chase a story we could brag about later. Eight people hacked to death in 1912, the killer never found. Creepy, sure, but not real danger. We packed snacks, a cooler of beer, and the kind of confidence only grown men acting like teenagers can have. I had no idea how wrong I was.

The drive from Wisconsin felt easy. The sun was warm, music loud, Chris teasing us about “ghost hunting.” He always joked his way out of fear. Alex, at the wheel, kept scrolling details on his phone whenever we stopped for gas. “He covered all the mirrors,” he said once, voice low. “He didn’t want to see himself.” The car went quiet. Even then, something about that detail sat heavy in my chest.

Villisca was a quiet little town. The house didn’t look like it had seen hell. Just a white two-story home with a porch swing and an unassuming lawn. The kind of place where you’d expect lemonade and Sunday dinners, not screams in the night.

A woman named Linda met us at the door. She had a calm way about her, like someone who’d grown overly comfortable with darkness. She walked us through each room in a steady voice, pointing to where each body had been found. She talked about the kids like they were still alive.

Upstairs in the children’s room, two tiny beds sat side by side. The wallpaper, once cheerful, had dulled into yellowed patches. Linda paused before speaking, like something unseen was listening with us. “Some nights people hear footsteps up here. Sometimes crying.” She smiled, but her eyes didn’t. “Don’t worry. The doors lock from inside.”

I wanted to laugh it off, but the house felt like it was barely breathing. Dim light, air thick and stale. Every surface seemed to hold a memory it refused to let go of.

When the tour ended, Linda handed us the keys and left without a glance back. We were alone with the silence.

We tossed our sleeping bags on the parlor floor. No way any of us were sleeping upstairs. We cracked open beers and tried to joke again. It didn’t work. The house listened. The house waited.

Chris filled the air with theories about the killer. A jealous preacher. A drifter. A relative. Alex went quieter with each passing minute, taking sips of beer without tasting it, eyes drifting toward the staircase like something was calling him.

By ten, he stood up. “I want to check upstairs again. Maybe get photos for the blog.” He held his flashlight close, fingers tight. We told him to be careful. He nodded once and disappeared into the dark.

The minutes dragged. The creaks above us became footsteps. Back and forth. Slow. Then nothing.

When the silence came, it felt heavy enough to crush bone.

I checked the time. Nearly 11:30. “We should go,” I told Chris. We moved as a pair, stair by stair, every sound too loud.

We called his name. No response.

The children’s room door was cracked open, moonlight spilling inside. Alex sat slumped on the floor, his back against a bed. His breathing was ragged, hands trembling over his chest.

Blood kept spilling through his fingers.

The knife lay beside him. Our knife from the cooler. Its blade caught the thin light like a wink.

“I didn’t… I didn’t mean to,” he gasped. “I wasn’t even thinking. My hand just moved. Like someone else… someone else did it.”

I never felt so cold.

Chris dialed 911 with shaking hands while I pressed against the wound, trying to hold in life. Alex stared past us, like he saw someone standing just behind our shoulders. His watch flashed the time: 12:45 a.m. The same moment the Moore family had died more than a century ago.

It didn’t feel like coincidence.

The paramedics rushed in and hauled him away, calling it an accident. At the hospital, the doctors said he would live. The police asked questions we couldn’t answer. Alex avoided all of us after. He left his job. He stopped laughing. He moved somewhere far away.

People who stay at that house like to brag that nothing can really touch them there. That ghosts are just stories.

They haven’t seen a friend stab himself while his face shows pure confusion. They haven’t heard him whisper, “It made me do it,” like a prayer he wished he didn’t believe.

There is something inside those walls. It doesn’t care if you believe in it. It waits for you to let your guard down.

If you ever think of staying the night in Villisca, don’t. Save your curiosity for a place that won’t follow you home. Some houses don’t just remember violence.

Some houses lean in and ask for more.





# ""The Quiet Ones"":

I had planned Yosemite for months, clinging to the fantasy of tall pines and cold rivers washing the stress out of me. My best friend Lisa and I counted down the days at work, joking about how we would “disappear into nature.” We booked Cedar Lodge because it was cheap and close to the entrance. Convenient was all we cared about. Not safe. Not history. Just a place to sleep.

The lobby smelled like old coffee and air freshener fighting a losing battle against mildew. The woman at the front desk looked drained, like she had seen too many tourists and too many late nights. She slid our key across the counter.

“Room 509. Quiet back there. If anything needs fixing, ask Cary. He’s always around.”

The way she said “always around” stuck with me for reasons I could not explain yet.

Outside, the motel wrapped around a dim courtyard. No views of mountains. Only worn concrete and buzzing lights. We unpacked and sat on the porch with a couple sodas, waiting for dusk to settle. That was when he appeared.

Tall. Shoulders slumped. Toolbox in hand. Hair unbrushed like he didn’t care what anyone thought of him.

“Evening, ladies,” he said. “I’m Cary. The handyman. Everything working fine in there?”

His voice was steady but too quiet, as if he wanted us to lean in closer.

“Everything’s great. Thanks,” I answered, because politeness is automatic. Lisa filled the silence by mentioning tomorrow’s hiking plans.

Cary nodded like he was studying us. “Yosemite’s beautiful. Real easy to get lost, though. People vanish out there more than you’d think.”

He held my gaze a second too long. My skin prickled. When he finally walked away, the footsteps faded like he was gliding rather than stepping.

I brushed it off. You always brush it off the first time.

The next morning, waterfalls and granite walls erased every worry. We spent hours wandering trails, breathing deep like we’d found the version of ourselves we liked better. By the time we returned, my legs were singing.

A few doors down, we met three travelers settling into their room. A cheerful mom named Carole, her teenage daughter Juli, and Silvina, an exchange student from Argentina. They were the kind of people who brought brightness with them. The kind strangers like to talk to.

We exchanged trail advice. Juli laughed as she flashed her camera, proud of every snapshot. Silvina’s English was careful, but her excitement wasn’t.

When Cary walked past, fixing a light that didn’t look broken, his eyes stayed too long on them. Not a glance. A calculation.

Dinner that night was mediocre burgers and fries, but the uneasiness returned the moment Cary sat at the counter inside the lodge restaurant. He never looked fully at us. Just enough that I could feel it on the edges of my vision. When I asked Lisa if she noticed, she waved it off.

“He’s just lonely. Small-town type.”

Maybe I wanted to believe her. Sleep didn’t come easy. Every creak outside sounded like footsteps stopping right at our door.

The next day was more hiking, more beauty, a temporary escape. Until we drove back and saw the door to Carole’s room hanging open like a jaw unhinged. The inside was a storm of scattered clothes and overturned bags.

“Hello?” I called.

Silence swallowed my voice.

We reported it. The clerk thanked us with a shaky nod. Cary stood nearby with a mop, eyes locked on us while pretending not to listen. His knuckles were white around the handle.

That night the air turned suffocating. Guests whispered in corners. By morning, police cars were in the lot.

Missing. All three.

When officers knocked, I told them everything. Every stare. Every late-night sighting. They wrote it down but kept their faces flat. Cary looked calm as he talked to them. Too calm. He even smiled when he saw us leaving.

“Safe travels,” he said. “Be careful out there.”

We drove off pretending bravery. The moment we hit the highway, the speedometer climbed and neither of us told the other to slow down.

Then the news followed.

First, the burned car. Two bodies. Then Juli, found near a riverbank. The brutality was worse than nightmares. Strangled. Assaulted. Throats cut. Terrified and trapped by a monster who had chatted with us like we were neighbors.

Months later, another headline. Another woman. Joie Armstrong. A nature lover working in the park. Beheaded.

The suspect: Cary Stayner. The handyman. The quiet man who never raised his voice. The one who watched guests come and go, maybe deciding who would never leave.

His confession read like the script of a horror movie, except it was real. Too real. He had waited for opportunities. Planned his violence. Hidden the darkness beneath the role of “helpful handyman.” He even admitted he fantasized about killing long before he acted.

I still think about that night I saw him carrying something heavy toward his truck. How he paused when he saw me awake. I wonder if he marked us as too alert. Too aware. Or if luck placed us just inches outside his plan.

People talk about Yosemite like it is only waterfalls and wonder. They forget shadows live there too, cast by men who look ordinary. Every motel key. Every polite greeting. Each one a coin toss between trust and danger.

I went there seeking peace. Instead I learned nightmares walk in daylight, wearing name tags and offering help.





# ""Cheap Room"":

Anna and I had been stuck in our office cubicles too long. It was the summer of 1999, and we were craving anything that felt like a break from fluorescent lights and customer calls. A weekend in Atlantic City sounded perfect. Fast food, cheap thrills, and the boardwalk breeze. We joked the entire drive down from New York about how we were going to stretch our tiny budgets into high roller fantasies.

By the time we reached the city, the casinos were glittering, loud, packed. The fancy hotels were way too expensive. We circled block after block until we found a place a little too far from the lights. The Burgundy Motor Inn. A plain white sign, a cracked ice machine outside, and rows of rooms staring at a half empty parking lot.

It will do, Anna said, brushing off the unease I already felt. We were not here for luxury.

The front desk clerk barely acknowledged us. An older guy, tired eyes, fingers stained with newspaper ink. He slid a key across the counter. Room 112. Thirty-five dollars a night. No smile. No welcome. Just a sigh from behind that yellowed counter.

Inside, the room was standard motel style. One bed with a stiff floral cover, TV bolted to a stand, tiny bathroom with tiles the color of old teeth. We were still full of excitement though. We tossed our suitcases down and cranked on the light. That is when I noticed it. A sour odor, faint at first, like spoiled milk mixed with something metallic.

Do you smell that? I asked.

Probably the AC, Anna said, waving it off. Cheap places always smell a bit weird.

We headed out anyway. Casinos, neon, drinks, the salty air on the boardwalk. We lost most of our gambling money in the first hour and laughed about how bad we were at blackjack. It was close to midnight when we wobbled back to the motel, tired and still buzzing from the night.

The moment the key turned in the door, the odor slammed into us. It was thicker now, strong enough to make me pause.

That is worse, Anna said, covering her nose.

I checked the bathroom. Nothing. I felt around the carpet. No dampness. We opened the window for airflow, but it barely helped. Still, we were exhausted and did not feel like arguing with the grumpy guy at the desk this late. We changed, turned off the light, and tried to sleep.

The bed was wrong. Hard in some places, bumpy in others. Anna and I both complained, shifting and flipping, trying to find one comfortable spot. The smell made it worse, like something rotten was sitting right under our noses.

A few flies found their way inside. They buzzed against the wall, bouncing off the headboard. I got up and shut the window, then sprayed some cheap perfume around the room, hoping for a miracle. It helped for about three minutes.

Sleep did not come easy. Every time I drifted off the smell would claw its way back into my awareness, sour and heavy. I pulled the blanket higher, breathing through the fabric.

We woke up groggy and annoyed. The odor had soaked into our clothes. Over breakfast, Anna slammed her coffee mug down and said we are telling the front desk. Because we are not spending another night in that stink.

The clerk looked half asleep when we returned. He sent a maintenance guy who fiddled with the AC for five minutes. Nothing changed. After he left Anna muttered that she would rather sleep in the car.

We tried to make the most of the day. Sun, souvenir shops, greasy fries. We stayed out as long as we could, hoping maybe the smell would fade while the room aired out.

It did not.

Opening that door again made my eyes sting. Flies were everywhere now. They clung to the curtains and dive bombed the bedspread.

This is disgusting, I said, near gagging.

The desk sent a maid this time. She scrubbed floors, sprayed bleach, checked corners. When she reached the bed she stopped. She leaned in and breathed in through her mouth.

That is strong, she said quietly. Might be a dead mouse.

She left without solving anything. Anna and I sat at the edge of the bed, eating sandwiches from a greasy bag because we were too tired to go back out again. I stared at the carpet while chewing and noticed a dark spot near the base of the bed. It looked sticky.

Do you see that? I asked.

Anna crouched down. The smell seemed to roll out from that exact spot. She reached to pull the bed skirt aside. The box spring underneath looked bulky, as if stuffed with something uneven.

My heart sped up.

Help me check under here, I whispered.

We shoved the mattress off the frame. It fell to the floor with a dull thud. The fabric covering the box spring was torn in a few spots. Something pale pushed against the rip.

I froze.

Anna reached forward just enough to widen the tear.

The skin beneath was grayish and swollen. A cheek. A jaw. A face.

A dead face.

Anna screamed and stumbled back against the wall. I backed up so fast I almost tripped over my suitcase.

We had been sleeping on top of a corpse.

My fingers shook as I grabbed the phone and dialed 911. Anna was yelling at the front desk through her own phone. The next minutes passed in a blur. Sirens. Officers pushing us out into the parking lot. Questions. Flashing lights reflecting off the windows of the Burgundy Motor Inn.

They pulled the box spring apart and removed the body. A man in his sixties. Murdered days earlier. His name was Saul Hernandez. He had disappeared from New York. Someone stuffed him inside that bed frame and left him to rot while guests came and went. We were next in a sick timeline. If we had not complained, who knows how long he would have stayed there.

Detectives took our statements until the sky turned purple with dawn. The motel lights flickered. The air still smelled foul.

We drove home without speaking. Neither of us looked back at the Burgundy Motor Inn. Atlantic City was supposed to be a fun escape. Instead, we discovered we were sleeping on top of a nightmare.

Even now, whenever I check into a cheap room, the first thing I do is lift the mattress.",1,1761356697.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

No one tells you love can end gently.
That it can fade without breaking.
That it can still feel soft
even when it’s over.

We went out sometimes.
Made breakfast.
Talked about nothing while our phones buzzed on the table.
He was calm.
I was calm too.
And for a while that was enough.

His last love was chaos.
I never really had it
So when peace found us, we held onto it.
The peace was real.
It was shared.
We genuinely loved each other.
We just didn’t know how to keep it alive
when distance started counting the days for us.

We lived in the same place for about a month.
The air smelled like coffee in the morning.
We laughed a lot.
And then camp ended.
We said goodbye like it was temporary,
like we’d figure it out.
But we never did.

I ended it first.
Not because I stopped loving him,
but because I was scared the distance would turn love into waiting.
I thought ending it early would hurt less.
It didn’t.

How do you love someone
who’s standing right in front of you
only to watch him turn into a notification bubble?
How do you hold someone
whose voice becomes signal and static?
How can I hug, kiss, and care
for someone I can’t reach?

For a while I thought I was the problem.
That maybe I was boring.
Because every movie says love should be loud.
Should fall apart dramatically.
Should have a reason to end.

But love isn’t like that.
Love was him waking up early to shower
because I said I hate when people smell bad.
It was him asking me to wake him.
It was me making breakfast while he was showering.
It was laughter that didn’t need a punchline.

It wasn’t perfect.
It wasn’t tragic.
It just was.

Now the peace feels heavier without him in it.
I still make too much coffee.
Still set the table for two.
Still check my phone,
half-hoping for a message that won’t come.

It wasn’t a story worth a movie.
It didn’t explode or fall apart.
It just ended quietly.
And the quiet stayed.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Inter Milan vs. Napoli: A Clash of Spreadsheet Defenders and Midfield Magicians**

The Serie A titans Inter Milan and Napoli collide in Naples this Saturday, and the odds are as tight as a Neapolitan’s grip on their espresso. Let’s break it down with the precision of a GPS and the humor of a GPS that’s lost.

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You’ll Actually Enjoy**  
The bookmakers are throwing numbers like confetti at a Roman feast. Inter Milan is the slight favorite at **2.35 decimal odds** (implied probability: \~42.5%), while Napoli checks in at **3.2** (\~31.25%). The draw? A meager **3.1** (\~32.25%), suggesting bookies expect a gritty, low-scoring duel. The spread favors Inter by a hair (-0.25), and the total goals line is **2.25**, with underdogs getting better odds. Translated from Bookmaker-ese: *“This game will be a tactical borefest where someone trips over a water bottle and scores an own goal.”*

**Digesting the News: De Bruyne, Brick Walls, and Maradona’s Ghost**  
Inter’s lineup is a spreadsheet come to life—organized, efficient, and slightly boring. Their defense features **Akanji, Acerbi, and Bastoni**, a trio so disciplined they could turn the Colosseum into a no-sneaker zone. Midfielders like **Barella and Çalhanoglu** are the Serie A’s version of a coffee table: sturdy, occasionally in the way, but essential for keeping the offense from spilling over. Up top, **Lautaro Martínez** is still here, though he’s been outscored by his own hairline recently.

Napoli, meanwhile, have **Kevin De Bruyne** in their midfield. Yes, *that* Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgian wizard, now in Naples after a transfer so shocking it made Maradona’s “Hand of God” look routine, is

1offajf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThomasTheThinkEngine/comments/1offajf/the_adventure_begins_rewrite/,The adventure begins rewrite,"The  adventure  began to have sort of a bad ramp so I decided to remake it by adding both the  three railway engines and Thomas the Tank Engine  characterizations to the background engines and giving  series personalities so let’s get started with, The prologue  we start with introduction of Sodor and it’s various railways such as the Smr The wsr  and the  TKer that has recently merged into the Northwestern Railway, and also an introduction of the narrow gauge railways like sr cfr and the msr and also an introduction to Sodor  we would also introduce the controller of the railway sir topham hatt we would also take a look at Thomas and  lives before they arrived at the railway Edwards old railway the furnace railway didn’t exactly treat him kindly not that it was a toxic environment it just they didn’t think he was useful that much in comparison to Thomas‘s old railway the lbscr wasn’t as bad. It was just boring to him. since he would just pull trains all day every day and very uneventful. Eventually, we would see them go to Sodor and help construct the north Northwestern. We wouldn’t spend too much time in 1915 but it would be enough to. Show  before their Sodor days  the railway and then meeting up the  1916 to 1922 would be more of a montage So the fans have something  make stories about

act one We would demonstrate the time period of Sodor history of the locomotive crisis of all the engines on Sodor, struggling with the work, causing the fat controller to buy an Atlantic to act as the express engine and the heavy engine but You all know what happened Before we get to the introduction of Henry, we are going to show a flashback of his life. His origin is like in the books, but I would actually make his CGI personality. Makes sense here since Henry supposed to be the most pathetic of the fleet at this time and It Demonstrate of how he acts and also I want him to be a tiny bit more nicer so he won’t be another Gordon and if you’re going to make a character sympathetic, don’t have them be  A jerk it ruins  The effect anyway back to 22 Henry arrived wheezing and coughing at Sodor, but unlike the book where the fat controller was outrage, it was the director of the board Albert rugby who said the line topham was annoyed, but he decided to give Henry a chance As you all know, Henry was a  bag with passenger work   he was very good with good work so he was kept  as the good engine You might expect I would introduce Gordon by this time  yet we’re still a year away. I would introduce 98462 and 87546 and I would make them completely nasty  during this time I would also introduce the red tender  the Green tender engine And some of the background engines from the early books given them a personality I would Have their Basis be like the ones that rexeljet  came up with, and I would give them personalities and I would make several reference To  Events,that  at this time on the narrow gauge railways  We go to 1923 to get the introduction of Gordon and we would see his backstory  he wasn’t really doing that much on his old railway since the A1 were introduced, and since Gordon was the prototype, it was little to no reason to keep him around anymore. He was just left on the siding for Months at a time. And his company were the flying Scotsman as I think it would be best to introduce him and his brotherly connection to Gordon Also, I would make very clear that topham Originally wanted to buy Scotsman, but Scotsman  to the direction of Gordon and that’s how he got the photo

act 2 by act two, we would begin the to adapt the three railway engines Edwards Day out and Edward and Gordon are exactly on how they were in the books but the sad story of Henry. It’s still the same but Henry’s reasoning for wanting to stay in the tunnel is different instead of his being spoiled is the real reason he did it Because his steam pressure was acting up and he didn’t want to look silly so he decided to look more silly and also The fat controller was not the one who boarded up Henry in the tunnel that was  and also he didn’t make people try to push or pull Henry out because that would be insane and we would get a scene of the fat  controller not being happy with Albert Also, the red tender engine In the story is not James and he’s actually a furnace railway D class  Edward Henry and Gordon would be exactly almost like in the books But I would make a reference to the LMS Deal And also the fat  controller would fire Albert

act 3 and we get you the adaption of Thomas the Tank Engine, but I Would make it different starting by the two stories Starting by which I forgot to mention, Thomas is not  and he has been pulling trains and doing odd jobs here and there by this time so starting with Thomas and Gordon I It is still  the same story but Gordon did not mean to pull With him act behind of the express Gordon still gets punished in the end Thomas pulls a train this story I would change the most. I would actually have Thomas Not screw  pulling Henry’s train since as many people would pointed out that  probably felt the weight or lack their of I would simply Remake the The adaptation Two have two stories where Thomas Succeed   and he failed As I’m pretty sure by that time, Wilbur was still keeping it a kids book and not a series about some part of realism. I would also add a sub plot about the four main engines getting Sent away advertently, causing most of the events in the Adaption

act 4 And we   but before we get to Thomas and the trucks we introduced James his origin story is exactly like it is in the in the Books except that he was built in 1920 not in 19 the main reason why he doesn’t have as much experience as most of the engines is due to the  he has wooden   LMS sees him as a hazard so he’s been in the shed for a couple of years and most of the games scenes would happen at this time. Thomas and the truck still happened the way it did, but it was due to the fact the red tenor engine was rounding up the trucks so that Thomas would have an accident after that the fan controller said the The four main engines away and we would have Thomas to the rescue rescuing James and Thomas getting his Branch line

The ending It would still be the same as it was in the actual film, but Glenn would actually still be in working operation and not In a siding as the coffee pot would still be working Until the 1950s",1,1761356297.0,ThomasTheThinkEngine,0,1.0,False

I keep seeing art, writing, and photography workshops around, but they’re never really people my age or in a similar place in life. I think it’d be super fun to start something chill like a coffee meet-up group for creative people who want to make real connections.

Some ideas:
• Art, music, or poetry nights
• Writing workshops or junk journaling sessions
• Small group where we can share what we’ve been working on and talk! 
• we could also do a book club! 

I’m local to the area, but it’s been tough trying to make new friends at this stage, I commute for school and work a lot, so it’s hard to meet people naturally. I just want to find a small group of kind, creative people who want to build something consistent and genuine.

*the only thing she has to do that day is go to the grocery store to buy ingredients to make food to go to her cousin’s house the next day. Shows a grocery haul of Halloween candy, eggs, a baguette, pre-pulled rotisserie chicken, baby carrots, Cheetos, Annie’s Mac and cheese, ranch dressing, feta cheese, cream cheese, bagel chips, rice Chex, granola, pepperoni, pringles, protein pasta, Kodiak protein granola bars, pillsbury crescent rolls, mozzarella cheese, tomato soup, hot sauce, mini chipwiches (claims that the baby wants them 🙄) and sourdough pretzels. (Literally entire haul was junk and processed food.. how she passed her glucose test is beyond me)

*opens Amazon package of “viral” bath mats, a runner for the hallway, another matching set of loungewear. Shows herself laying out the runner and her ass all but bumps right into her camera as she backs up. Shows the bath mat that still has the tags on them.. says she needs to take the tag off, but I’m pretty sure she still hasn’t. Puts up a shower curtain on the blue tiled shower that no one currently uses and that she doesn’t love, but the shower curtain will hide the blue.

*October 12- has therapy and a hypnobirthing session

*October 15- says she made a mistake and misunderstood her therapist when she suggested starting hypnobirthing sessions in place of regular therapy sessions. She essentially showed up and there wasn’t an appointment booked. Had a headache and made gift guides while laying on the couch. Talks about Dancing with the Stars. Has a call with her account manager from Maevely (spelling?) which is similar to LTK. She talks about how she basically prefers LTK and ShopMy and how the Maevely interface isn’t as great.. (so why is she using it?)

-October 16- glucose test day. Says she’s not nervous about the drink, but nervous that she won’t pass. She doesn’t know why, but there’s nothing she can do about it. (She doesn’t know why she’s nervous she won’t pass?! Such a dimwit). Says she’s still feeling good at 28 weeks, is just more breathless, harder to get comfortable to sleep, headaches. Can’t decide if she wants to order a pregnancy pillow. Hopes to get an ultrasound to see the baby. They are driving separately to the appointment because she has a nail appointment with her mom after and is going to pack snacks in case she feels bad after. Talks about how she eats a lot of sugar and her friend Steph predicted that she’ll like the glucose drink. She chugs the glucose drink in four swigs and says it wasn’t that bad.

*October 18- went to Target, filmed a few things, is going to go for a walk. Is trying to maintain being active before it gets too cold. Plans to clean afterwards because her old teacher friends are coming to see her house and then they’re going to a winery. Then has dinner plans with her high school friends.

*October 19- going to a nature center and meeting Nick’s family there. Shows clips of the animals there.  Later at home shows her new coffee table and side table. (Her house has zero cohesiveness to any of the furniture but we’ve already discussed that)

*October 20- talks about loving Mondays because it’s a fresh start (to what for her?). Going to Trader Joe’s and old Navy. Continue working on gift guides and editing the vlog clips. Trader Joe’s haul is more junk- chips, pastry puffs, cereal, Mac and cheese, crackers, tortellini, ravioli, baby carrots, cheese, peanut butter cups, and bread.",6,1761355747.0,CTInfluencerSnark,4,1.0,False

I know it's early but I can already see such a big difference and I am MANIFESTING it keeps improving. I took a bunch of advice from this sub and I am so fucking grateful to everyone who took time out of their busy lives to give me advice and talk me off the ledge.

Besides from the things my doctor told me to do–doxycycline 100mg BID, clindamycin 1% topical BID, and hibiclens as the last part in my shower (everything below the neck, avoiding all mucous membranes)–here are some of the tips I took from this thread that I am convinced helped:

1. Reducing/eliminating dairy–I started about a week ago, I haven't completely eliminated it, I just stopped putting cheese on stuff and switched out my coffee creamer to non-dairy. Idk how effective it's been but I told myself hey, I can't say I want this gone if I'm not willing to try everything.

2. BOY SHORT UNDERWEAR–I think this has been the biggest contributor to my success. I bought some boy short underwear last week and I have been wearing those only, no other undies, to reduce friction around my bikini line. I have noticed so much less irritation and redness in that area in addition to the lack of flares.

3. Zinc soap–a bunch of people on here have been raving about using head n shoulders as body wash, but I have very sensitive skin so I bought pyrithione zinc 2% hypoallergenic soap instead and use that to wash my body, same active ingredient as head n shoulders. Besides from HS I have very very dry, sensitive, irritation-prone skin (think like eczema but not as bad as eczema at all just annoying) and I have noticed that the soap has really helped the irritation and dryness on my entire body.

I'm really glad I didn't give up and I've been open to trying EVERYTHING

I am manifesting into existence that it only keeps getting better from here and it NEVER EVER gets worse

1ofez3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ofez3j/the_house_of_skrik_where_no_one_can_hear_you/,The House Of Skrik (Where No One Can Hear You Scream But You),"It was a few years ago, about 6 months after I moved to a new city where a close friend I had from childhood lived too. We hadnt spoken in a bit because of our schedules, but some time during the weekend before October 31st,, we met up at a local cafe. I pulled up to the spot and made my way inside and saw him sitting at a booth, and I moved to join him. Devon's hands trembled around his coffee cup, which I thought was just the caffeine at first. He'd messaged me three times that morning, each text more desperate than the last: \*Need to talk. About my brother. About what happened at the house on Jacko Lane.\* 

I'd heard rumors about 20518 Jacko Lane ever since I moved into the city. Everyone had. The haunted house attraction that was too realistic, too intense. The place people whispered about but never fully explained. I asked him if he had too much coffee to drink due to how jittery he was, but that’s when he said he hadnt taken a single sip yet. And that he was restless for an entirely different reason. Devon ordered his coffee and didn't touch it ten minutes before I got there. He just stared at the table and didnt even look at me after I sat down. I could tell he was working up the courage to say something heavy.

""My brother Matt can't talk anymore,"" he finally said. ""Doctors say there's nothing physically wrong with him. Vocal cords intact, throat fine, brain scans normal. But he hasn't spoken a single word since Halloween night. And I know why.""

He pulled out his phone and showed me a photo of a young man, no older than 17 or 18, with an easy smile and kind eyes. ""That was Matt three months ago. Now he just sits in his room, writing the same thing over and over: \*I can still hear myself screaming.\*""

“What are you talking about?” I asked. “Did he go deaf or something? And what does this have to do with your texts about Jacko Lane?”

Devon took a shaky breath and began.

""The house on Jacko Lane wasn't always an attraction. Back in the 1800s, it was just a home, until something moved in. People called it the Skrik. Local legend said it fed on sound, specifically the sound of human screams. It would show people how they'd die, mimicking their face in their final moments, twisted in terror. The trauma was so severe that victims couldn't speak afterward. Some said the Skrik didn't just steal their screams, it took their voices entirely, keeping them forever.""

""The oldest incident anyone documented was 1893. A family lived there, and one night, the youngest daughter started screaming. By morning, she was mute. They found her in the hallway, staring at the wall, unable to explain what she'd seen. The family fled. The house sat abandoned for decades. Then in 1987, an artist named Mr. Munch bought the property.  
I don't know. He was a gothic horror artist, but people said his work was technically perfect yet emotionally hollow. He could paint rage, sadness, joy; everything except genuine fear. Critics said his fear-based pieces lacked authenticity, like he'd never truly experienced terror firsthand.""

""Mr. Munch knew the legends. That's why he bought it. Some say nothing scared him, so the Skrik couldn't feed. Others say he made a deal: the Skrik could have one night a year—Halloween—in exchange for leaving him alone the other 364 days. Either way, Mr. Munch turned the place into a haunted house attraction. Called it 'House of Skrik.' Tongue-in-cheek, you know? Playing into the urban legends.""

Devon's voice dropped lower. ""But there's this hallway inside the haunted house. Long corridor with paintings on both walls. Each one shows a face frozen mid-scream, twisted in absolute terror. Most are dated: 1988, 1995, 2003, 2011. One painting per year, always appearing November 1st. But the very first painting, the one at the hallway's end, is dated 1893. Then nothing until 1987.""

""Ninety-four years of silence. Then Mr.Munch shows up, and the paintings start again. But was it really silence, or was there simply no one around to speak up?""

He paused, gathering himself. ""I told Matt all of this. I'm four years older, and when we were kids, I'd scare him with Jacko Lane stories and tell him never to go to the haunted house. As we got older, I started believing them more. I had this friend Jake whose cousin went to House of Skrik on Halloween 2019. Jake’s cousin came back different. Wouldn't speak, couldn't speak. Doctors found nothing wrong. Jake swore his cousin tried to write down what happened, but his hands would shake too badly to form words.""

""I told Matt about Jake's cousin. I begged him not to go. But Matt?"" Devon smiled sadly. ""Matt thought I was full of shit. He figured Mr. Munch, the owner of the haunted house, started the rumors himself to drive up business, especially during the Halloween season. 'It's just a haunted house,' he'd say. 'It's all actors and special effects. You're buying into viral marketing. I’m not the same little kid you scared with those stories. I know they’re not real dude.'""

""Last Halloween, Matt and three of his friends decided to prove me wrong. I tried to stop him. We fought about it. He called me paranoid, said I was letting old stories and fake urban legends control me. The last thing he said before leaving was, 'I'll text you when it's over and you can apologize for being a crazy older brother.'""

Devon's voice cracked. ""He never texted me when it was over.""

""According to his friends, everything seemed normal at first. Standard haunted house stuff: jump scares, strobe lights, fog machines. Then they entered the hallway with the paintings. The group stayed together initially, but the corridor was so long and winding. At some point, Matt fell behind. His friends didn't notice immediately. When they realized, they doubled back, but the hallway had changed. It felt longer. The paintings seemed different. And they started hearing something.""

""Screaming. Faint, distant, like it was coming from inside the walls. One of Matt's friends swore he recognized one of the voices. Not from the attraction, from somewhere real, somewhere he couldn't place. They called for Matt, but he didn't answer. The screaming got louder.""

Devon's hands were shaking badly now. ""They found him at the hallway's end, standing in front of that 1893 painting, completely still. He was staring at the empty wall space beside it, his hands on the sides of his face. His mouth gaped open like he was trying to scream but couldn't. His eyes were wrong. Wide. Terrified. Seeing something they couldn't.""

""They had to physically drag him out. He hasn't spoken since. Won't write more than those six words: \*I can still hear myself screaming.\* The doctors, the therapists, everyone says it's psychological trauma. Selective mutism triggered by extreme fear. But I know what really happened.""

He pulled out another photo. A painting. A young man's face, frozen in a silent scream, every muscle taut with terror, his hands on his face and his mouth wide open. Then I saw it. The eyes. Those eyes were Matt's eyes.

""This appeared on the wall November first. Dated October 31, 2021. Matt's painting.""

The air in the café felt heavier. Devon continued, barely above a whisper.

""I went back. Three weeks ago. I waited until Mr. Munch closed up for the night and snuck in. I needed to see that hallway, needed to understand. When I got there, I stood in the silence, looking at the paintings. Decades of faces, all screaming, all silent. And then I heard it.""

""Screaming. Multiple voices, layered over each other, muffled like they were coming from behind thick cloth. But echoing, like they were in a vast corridor. I recognized one of them: Jake's cousin. I'd met him twice at barbecues. I knew his voice. And then I heard Matt.""

Tears streamed down Devon's face. ""My brother was screaming. Not had screamed, not past tense. He \*was\* screaming, right then, in that moment. His voice was there, in that hallway, trapped in the walls or the paintings or wherever the Skrik keeps them. Still screaming. Still trying to warn someone. Still terrified.""

""Their voices aren't gone. They're just somewhere else. Somewhere we can't reach. And every Halloween, the Skrik adds another.""

Devon finished his now-cold coffee in one bitter swallow. ""Matt sits in his room and writes those words over and over: \*I can still hear myself screaming.\* Because he can. He hears his own voice trapped in that hallway, echoing forever, and there's nothing he can do. He can't warn anyone. Can't explain. Can't scream loud enough for anyone to hear except himself.""

""Mr. Munch still runs the attraction. Every Halloween, people line up. They think it's entertainment, special effects, really committed actors. And maybe ninety-nine percent of it is. But somewhere in that hallway, someone's going to see something real. Something that will steal their voice and trap it in those walls forever.""

He stood to leave, then stopped. ""You're going to write about this, aren't you? That's why I'm telling you. Someone needs to know. Maybe someone who reads it will believe it enough to stay away.""

""But honestly?"" Devon looked back at me, eyes hollow with guilt. ""I don't think it matters. The Skrik doesn't need believers. It just needs someone alone in that hallway, someone who dismisses the warnings just like Matt did. Someone who won't understand until it's too late, until they're standing face-to-face with their own death, watching themselves die.""

""And then there will be another painting. Another scream trapped forever in those walls. Another voice that can never warn the next person walking down that hallway on Halloween night, thinking it's all just a show.""

Devon left cash on the table and walked out. I haven't been able to stop thinking about what he told me. About Matt, sitting in his room, hearing his own eternal scream. About that hallway and its growing collection of stolen voices.

About how every year on Halloween, House of Skrik adds one more painting to its walls.

And how somewhere behind those painted eyes, someone is still screaming. Forever.",1,1761355332.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Me (23M) and my crush (22F) and we know each other via mutual friends. At first, it was summer 2024, we was having a good time, we saw each other twice but we talked a lot ab like 4hrs min, then we texted a lot blah blah, the vibe was good then i did something very stupid but also embarrassing for me for its very logical that i thought i could stop all the talking which i did and i disappeared from her life and she understood that. 
Fast forward, beginning of 2025, she came visit my house because her friends are my housemates, it was the first time we saw each other after a a long time, so she was shy, poorly answered my casual questions so I felt her vibe and I respect that, nothing further and i could see myselft in front of the gym the next day. 

Couple months later, begining of summer 2025, she came to my house multiple times but these times, she was back to friendly mode with me start to talk w me make some jokes and ofc i managed to say that she was beautiful without being cringe. So I could say that she sent me back to the beginning of the process with more cautious and i knew that so i kept myself lowkey, zero dm nothing like nothing. 

Then one day, on my birthday which is in August, she sent me a happy birthday text, like out of no where pop just like that, the thing is i remembered very well that i didnt ever tell her my bday, my house mates didnt tell her, like no one told her and i guess the only thing that made me felt logical was i gave her my email which have 208 in it but it was one year ago, it confused me alot. The next, i texted some text like hows your day going and she responded poorly so i guess yeah lets forget this girl for real, plus she gotta move to Paris soon.

Until one week ago, i posted a story on insta that i got invited to a fashion event in Paris, so she texted me asking if i go to Paris, she would like to meet me. I can’t go because I got things to do, so we texted a lil bit, good vibe, she responded well but she also asked me if I know some job offer, so i felt that she was using me a lil bit for her job offer but who care, i basically told her that i can contact you to my friends who work in fashion, she declined directly knowing that she couldnt work in that environment so i was like okay.  But she said something like quote by quote “Oh I saw your story, but I didnt you say something to me. Idk if you posted it for fun or.”
I rapidly wrapped the dm and made sure that we can grab coffee or potentially a date. 
I’m planning on go see her from Christmas to New Year so i can also see my friends. 

My questions are : what do you guys really think ab the situation ? What should i do ? Should i text her more since we are in different cities to get in touch ? Or should leave it be ? Go with the flow ? Orrrr WHAT SHOULD I DOO. More context, we are both asians, and i can know for sure that she is not type of girls who play games a lot, she just like graphic designs and never had bf so yeah 🥺🥺 thank you you guys for staying with me till now, I’m just a simple guy who want a dream gf before Christmas, hope you guys around the globe sleep well

I have been remote since covid. I have loved it for a while, but now it is sorta becoming…bland. I miss human interaction, having a work / life separation, going outside, driving around, getting coffee, getting dressed up for work, working from another place besides my home office, etc. 

My first job out of college was in an office and I ADORED it. I reflect on those years fondly. My past job 5 years have been…fine. 

I have hobbies and friends, but to be honest I am SICK of being home 90 percent of my time. 

Does the fun of WFH feel like it’s wearing off at all for anyone? It all depends on the individual jobs of course…but would love to hear thoughts. ",0,1761354490.0,remotework,5,0.25,False
1ofeotg,https://i.redd.it/mu1hniq3r5xf1.jpeg,"I'm embarrassed and ashamed for using weed to the point of ridicule I deserved. I want to grow up, not grow op.","The truth is four vices I use (alcohol, cigarettes weed and caffeine) are or at least were all AWFUL. 

This is probably the most disturbing my post history has been, with all of my manic and wild writing and what not but now I think I know WHY... 

I truly want to quit all four vices at once, and I haven't used any cannabis or cannabis products since last weekend, and next weekend is Halloween. 

I've drank 6 beers over 6 days (4 on Wednesday and two today) and didn't drink at all Sunday/Monday/Tuesday nor Thursday. 

I knew Wednesday was too much even with four tall cans (16oz 5%), which is 5.33 standard beers. Two tall cans is 2.67 beers, a far more reasonable amount for a day. 

Why didn't I quit everything when I should have? Because I was fucking stupid, still am until I quit all this shit.  

I thought to myself what would be the best quit date to have for all my vices? 

- Alcohol: December 3, 2021 
- Cigarettes: November 25, 2018 
- Weed: July 27, 2013
- Caffeine: January 26, 2025 

Alcohol should've been when I did a 168 day break, and made it to May 21, 2022. 

Cigarettes should've been almost 7 years ago now, when I did a whopping 1,672 days without any poppers (tobacco underneath weed through bongs) and went all the way until June 25, 2023. I've smoked like a chimney at most times since. 

Weed should've been my 18th birthday. You're not gonna want to be smoking pot with Peter Pan forever, just like how you're not gonna want to be smoking pan with Peter Pot forever. It's time to grow the fuck up unlike Bobby Dick Scroll, who was 10 weeks older than George Carlin but died young from a substance use habit. I'm about Bobby's age when he died or not much younger. 

Caffeine should've been earlier this year. Whenever I make my own coffee I drink way too much of it and eventually I'll have an arrhythmia. ",1,1761354456.0,HandwritingAnalysis,0,0.99,False

Alright folks, some technical difficulties have arisen! It seems the general kiosk code isn’t working for a couple of people who have tried, which I’m not sure why as it’s not tied to a specific store (I’ve clicked the “earn rewards” button and entered the code at multiple different locations before and no issues). Still happy to give out free food, it’ll just have to be in 15 minute increments as ill be placing online orders. 

~~Saw another post like this, so I figured I’d start my own.~~

~~If you’re **at or near a store and ready to order**, I’ll hook you up with one free item from the list below.~~

~~**I’m not placing online orders**… instead, I’ll give you a general kiosk code to enter in-store. Once you complete the order and it logs out, the code refreshes on my end so I can help the next person.~~

~~**Please only request a code if you’re ready to use it immediately**. It only works on the kiosk (not mobile or online) and the faster people use it, the more food I can give away.~~

~~*And for the shady folks: no saved payment methods on my account. I see you.*~~

➤ My pronouns are they/them.

➤ I have been playing Adopt Me since 2017 and I still love it even after all this time. 

➤ My favorite pets of mine are Jonathan the turtle and Vanilla Bean the albino bat I received Jonathan a day before Christmas 2024 and I absolutely love turtles so I am very happy I got them and for Vanilla Bean I got them in 2020 during the Halloween update and I was desperately trying to get the albino bat and on my last try with my friend on the phone I got them and due to my love of coffee I named them Vanilla Bean and they are very special to me and if you couldn’t tell by my username I love bats so I love them even more for that.

➤ My interests and hobbies are reading, writing, art, fashion, horror, collecting, nature, science, and video games. I also really love dolls and I primarily have Monster High dolls.

➤ A fun fact about me is that I love all things Halloween and in the game I am a Halloween item collector.

1ofelf3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ofelf3,"Blind bought hyped middle eastern fragrance clones, not impressed so far","I am an Indian student living in Australia, and I have been into fragrances for about a year. I’ve mostly had the cheaper designer (apart from 9pm and Club de nuit) fragrances so far, but decided to try out the hyped middle eastern clones. I blind bought Vulcan Feu and Kamrah Qahwa and both are quite mid so far.

As far as Kamrah Qahwa idk if my nose is broken or if i need to let it macerate, but I dont smell coffee at all, I just get a cinnamon bomb with chocolate. I think its a okay fragrance but its definitely not worth all the hype. As a lot of people have noted though, apparently it does open up with time so Im still willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.

Vulcan Feu is decent, but its still not what I expected. The opening smells too much of alcohol so this definitely needs to macerate longer, but as advertised I smell a lot of mango, its almost too much. It feels like splashing some mango soda on your body and letting it dry. Everyone in all reviews keeps comparing about how good of a clone but a good clone need not be a good fragrance. I had bought this with the hopes of making it my daily driver since its going to be summer in Australia, but I think I’ll stick to my dylan blue and man eau fraiche.

I had bought this from a middle eastern perfume exporter here in Australia and they gave me a sample of Ahmed al maghrabi Laathani and surprisingly its somehow the best out of the three. I’m definitely gonna buy a whole bottle in a few months.

Im not really impressed at all especially cus it was quite expensive (aud 146 in total), since middle eastern fragrances are not as cheap here as in India. I was previously quite disappointed with 9pm as well, it genuinely smells terrible. The only good middle eastern clone I’ve tried so far is Club de nuit.  Idk if blind buying hyped fragrances without trying is a good idea. Don’t fall for the hype, don’t buy based on others reviews as fragrance is subjective.",0,1761354173.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,9,0.38,False

I told him that i understood and that was it, but I am kinda thinking about it and I really enjoyed his presence, and I’m thinking, should I send him another text saying that I’d still like to see him, even as friends? idk if that is awkward or the right move, but he’s been going through my mind more than normal.",1,1761354013.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
