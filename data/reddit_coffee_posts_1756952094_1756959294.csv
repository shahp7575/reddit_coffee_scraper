TW: Drug use, drug addiction

Part 5: Standing at the Edge of the World

 

Animals in captivity tend to become docile after some time. Typically, animals born in captivity don’t develop a fear of the humans who come to bring food to them or the people who visit their enclosures all the time to gawk at them. The wild ones, however, are the ones that give the most fight and take the longest to become tame. They thrash and posture at the caretakers any time they come near them. Even if they only snarl and bare their fangs in a corner, they patiently wait for you to let your guard down around them. Thinking that maybe if you think you can be comfortable around them, they’ll get their opportunity to strike.

I didn’t plan on making the same mistake as I had before. I had taken a few extra days off work to tire out the Hollow I’d captured. This one had a lot more energy and stamina than the last one. I fashioned a new place to hold it, mostly out of fear that it would break free from the weak pipes on the sink. They could give at any moment had it kept thrashing around like it tended to do from time to time. I built a bar mounted to the hardwood floor and upgraded to some handcuffs and heavy-duty chains.

I had become a regular customer at the neighborhood hardware store, and the cashiers started to know my name. No doubt some of my purchases had become questionable, so I started visiting other places further away to draw suspicion away from my purchases.

The hollow now had a short chain lead that would be nearly impossible for even a healthy, full-grown adult to break out of, much less some hideous abomination that had barely any strength. Every day, it seemed to put up less of a fight; it wouldn’t be long now until I could leave it alone and return to work again.

I was grateful for that fact.

I had been tending my wounds and trying to ration out the morphine, slowly weaning myself from it. I was down to the last vial, and I knew I would have to deal with some withdrawal once it was gone. I wanted to mitigate as many of the side effects as I could.

Today would be a trial run. I slid a microwave dinner toward the Hollow with a push broom; it barely moved. There was a small clink as it lifted its head to see that I was still a safe distance from it and then down at the pitiful offering. Then it lay its head back down in defeat. That's what it seemed to do the last few days. I shut and bolted the door, then closed the new bars I had just installed and secured them, as well.

I pulled on it to make sure the hatch remained in place.

Between feedings, I would frequently make ten to twenty-minute trips out into town for supplies, but I never left too long or went too far away. I had to make sure that if it had gotten out, I could stop it. Getting inside the house was easy; getting out was a different story.

I had visited an opioid addiction clinic during one of my latest trips out. It was a little further than I felt comfortable with, and I had been gone for an hour or so. Nevertheless, I had to make the trip. I fiddled with the single pill in the bubble package they'd given me.

I had told them that it was an overuse of medications I had gotten from the hospital from a fight I had been in a few days prior, and that I only needed a single dose to come down. They must have believed me, because they gave me a single outpatient dose and sent me on my way. I don’t know if it was because I had no criminal record, or that I didn’t act like the fiending junkies that littered the waiting room, or because my story seemed believable. Either way, I was grateful that I could leave that neighborhood intact and without giving any of my information to them; the less of a paper trail, the better.

I popped the bubble packaging and placed the pill under my tongue, letting the bitter taste drain into my throat. It was terrible, but I knew it would help dull some of the pain of the withdrawal.

*Tomorrow, I have to go to work and I need to be presentable.*

My entire body shook, and I was dripping in sweat; every muscle ached, and I strained to even drink water. I forced down room-temperature bottle after bottle I had laid out for myself before the pain got too unbearable to walk. Every sip felt like needles in my throat, and I felt a crushing knot in my stomach as it struggled to keep the water down.

By midnight, I was up and walking around. I hadn't heard anything from the Hollows room in a few hours. I cracked open the door and peered inside; it lay there motionless. The only sign that it had any life in it was the rise and fall of its bony ribs, which flared with each intake of breath. I quietly shut the door and slowly made my way to the couch. I threw a blanket over myself and let sleep overtake me completely for the first time in days.

 

I woke to my alarm early in the morning. My eyes shot open, I shut it off, and made my way to the Hollows door. I heard soft, muffled breathing. I slowly backed away and quietly made my way up the stairs to get ready. I carefully clipped the stitches on my scar, which had just closed enough for me to feel comfortable removing them. I then carefully washed and shaved my face, trying my best not to put pressure on the healing bruises.

It wasn’t my best work, but it’d have to do.

I finished getting ready, then made my way out the garage door, and headed out to work. For the first time in a few weeks, I felt like things were finally going in my favor. I even put my music on at a low volume, but I kept my eyes open for anything strange.

 

I arrived at work and stepped into the front doors. As expected, there was a reaction from the front desk. As soon as she saw me, Amanda gasped.

“Mark, what happened to your face?” She asked, astonished.

“Oh, yeah. Bar fight.” I lied casually.

“Oh, my goodness, what was it for?” She inquired worriedly.

“Ah, just some ass hole I beat at darts.” I continued with the lie.

“He got you pretty good, it looks like?” She tsked.

“Yeah, well, you should see the other guy.” I replied

“Why? Is he worse?” She asked.

“No, like you should’ve seen him. Six-five, Greek god build. I didn’t stand a chance.” I joked and she laughed. “What are you doing Friday?” I asked boldly.

 

Life was beginning to get back to normal. As normal as it could be with a monster trapped in my house and the constant threat of something coming from the shadows to finish me off.

It had been about two weeks since I had started seeing Amanda. Word around the clinic spread like wildfire, and everyone seemed to gossip in hushed whispers any time I walked through. I wasn’t going to take anything seriously yet, not until things got more under control. Although how much more under control could it get? I hadn’t seen another Hollow since I captured one two weeks prior.

Things were quiet for sure, and while I enjoyed the silence, I couldn’t help but keep looking over my shoulder, expecting to see something. Anything. Although nothing ever came. It was just my thoughts playing tricks on me. A shadow out of the corner of my eye, or something rustling in the bushes, only for a small rodent to jump out and scurry away.

The Hollow I had captured barely seemed to have life left in it; all it seemed to do was lie in the same spot and breathe. I almost began to feel sorry for it; hell, I probably would have if it didn’t try to attack me any time I got close to it. The last few days, it had stopped eating the food I brought it. I started to think that there was something wrong with this one and that I was wasting my time keeping it alive.

I hadn’t learned anything new from this one that I didn’t already know from the last one. Maybe it would be better to put it out of its misery. No, I couldn’t have those kinds of thoughts. Even if it was useless to learn from, there was still the possibility that I could bring him back to normal. I couldn’t give up on that chance.

I finished the last few buttons of my shirt and stood in front of the mirror for a final check. This would be my third date with Amanda, and I was still trying to make a good impression. We had gone first to coffee and then to a movie. This time, I had a nice dinner planned for the evening. I finished with a tie and a navy-blue coat and did a once-over before heading out through my garage.

I headed into the restaurant and told them my name for my reservation. To my surprise, she was already seated even though it was five minutes early. I smiled, and she returned it. I sat down and we ordered drinks.

The night was going well, and we talked about the usual things, the chaos of treatment in the back. She told me about how the front desk always had to keep owners calm or make update calls, keeping customers informed.

At some point, however, we got to the topic of the dreams she had been having.

 

“You don’t really seem to get much sleep; you're looking so tired lately.” She inquired, sounding worried.

“Nah, I’m used to it,” I brushed it off, “I’m a lot tougher than I look. Besides, I don’t really like to sleep, and I don’t dream much when I do.”

“Really?” She said exasperatedly. “I had this dream the other night that something was chasing me. I couldn’t see what it was, but when I woke up, I swear I saw a face looking at me.”

I nodded, listening to her story. “Wild, dreams like that are from stress, I hear.”

“Yeah, there’s been a lot going on lately. Also…” Her eyes looked away from mine for a second. “I’ve been really worried about you. Things seem off lately, I can’t really understand it.”

It looked like my front wasn’t as rock solid as I’d hoped; people were starting to notice the cracks in my veneer.

“Well, go on. Maybe I can explain some of the worries you’ve been having.” I told her, hoping to ease some of her anxieties.

“Some days you come in and you’re fresh and happy like your normal self.” She explained. “But then out of nowhere it’s like… you’re just so much different, like a completely different person. You look different, you act different, even the way you walk seems like… you're scared of something. Are you afraid of something?”

Her eyes pleaded for the truth. It was something I couldn’t give her, but I could offer, at the very least, something to comfort her.

“It’s been hard lately,” that part was true, “my grandfather died in hospice last week. Between that and the insanity that’s been going on in the neighborhood…” I sighed. “It’s exhausting, and I’m just trying my best.”

She took my hand and smiled comfortingly. “You’re doing great, Mark.”

I felt the air grow still and dark, and that familiar frigid chill that hung by breath in the air. I saw Amanda look up and smile. It took everything in me not to look as I heard a guttural clicking and a looming presence over my shoulder. There was the sound of a throaty droll from over my shoulder, and I felt my body turning on its own. My eyes met the empty sockets of a Hollow. Dread washed over me, and I felt my face turn pale.

Amanda said something, but she sounded so very far away. The entire world was drowned out; it was only me and the monster that now stood over me, its sagging flesh rippling in slow motion as it opened its mouth. I knew what was coming, and I knew I wouldn’t have time to brace myself for it.

It let out a shattering, piercing shriek which knocked me out of my chair. Every muscle in my body locked, and I felt paralyzed. The solid ground rushed up to meet me. I didn’t feel the impact, but I knew the wind had been knocked out of me. I looked at the Hollow, and its hands reached for me, its fingers outstretched toward me.

I couldn’t get a breath in; my chest felt like it was too heavy. I saw the corners of my vision start to turn black as I could feel the strain pulling me into unconsciousness. Within seconds, panic flooded over me, but I was powerless to do anything about it.

The last thing I saw before complete darkness was the inhuman, sagging, fleshy fingers of the Hollow reaching for me.

 

I woke up to the sound of music, my head pounding and…lights.

I realized my head was leaning against a glass pane.

A window? No, I was moving. I closed my eyes tight and opened them, trying to get my bearings. I was in a car, but I wasn’t the one driving. I looked over to the driver's side, and Amanda smiled at me, noticing I was finally awake.

“Well, good morning, sleeping beauty.” She greeted.

“What happened?” I said groggily.

“You looked at the waiter and freaked out. I think it might have been a seizure.” She explained. “We’re on our way to St. Junipers.”

“I don’t think I need a hospital.” I protested.

“You passed out in the restaurant and have God knows what going on.” She insisted. “I’m taking you to the hospital.”

She had a point. I didn’t know what happened when I fell; for all I knew, I had a concussion. I resigned myself to at the very least getting checked out.

 

I was admitted quickly for emergency care. I told Amanda that she could go, and explained that I would call a rideshare to retrieve my car. She warned me to text her when I got an update on my condition. I agreed, and she waved me off.

At the hospital, they did several neuro exams to make sure I didn’t suffer from a concussion. After that, the nurses came in to ask me what happened. I explained that I wasn’t sure what caused it, that I used to suffer from chronic tinnitus, but it had suddenly disappeared after seven years of continuous ringing. I told them how I had tried everything possible, and nothing ever stopped it, that it just went away one day.

“So, what about the fall. What triggered it? Did you hear anything or maybe see something?” She asked.

I paused for just a moment. I couldn’t tell them what I was seeing; they would think I’m crazy and put me on a 48-hour psych hold.

“No,” I replied, “no, nothing like that, I just… I don’t know, I lost my balance and passed out.”

“Okay, well, I’ll get that passed along to the doctors. They’re probably going to want to get a brain scan and see if there’s anything concerning.” She typed into the laptop she’d brought in. “If it comes up clear, we’ll go ahead and send you home, sound good?”

She smiled, I nodded, and she left.

I got a sneaking thought that she didn’t believe me. There was something about the way she said it that didn’t sit right with me. I knew when someone held judgment in their voice. It was something I did my best to hold onto when I had to deal with owners.

 

Laid out on my back in a hospital gown in a claustrophobe's worst nightmare, I did my best to keep still with the sounds of grinding mechanical whirling echoing in my bones. It only took about ten minutes, but it felt like an hour inside.

Being told not to move made it worse. When someone tells you you’re not allowed to move, that’s when you start to itch; it’s always in the most inconvenient places, too. It was my face that itched, but even if I wanted to, there wasn’t enough room to reach up to scratch.

 

Afterward, I was wheeled back to my bed, where I waited for the results; they came about three hours later when the Neurology specialist came to see me. A fairly tall man with a dark complexion and a solemn look on his face that looked like he’d worn it his entire life.

“Mr. Andrews, good evening.” He said as he entered, holding a thin laptop computer.

“How’s it going, boss?” I replied casually.

“I’m doing well, I just have a few questions for you.” He said, powering on a display screen that hung on the wall.

“Okay,” I replied nervously, “like what?”

“First off, do you have a history of heavy drug use?”

His words hit me like a ton of bricks.

“N…No. Of course not.” I replied.

“No, LSD or amphetamines?” He went on connecting a cord to his laptop.

“No. Never.” I said truthfully.

“Have you ever heard or seen something that no one else could?” He went on.

I paused for just a second before shaking my head. The nurse must have told him that she didn’t believe me.

He punched a few keys into his computer and clicked his mouse a few times. A brain scan showed up. There was a small, dark grey area in the center on both the right and left sides of the brain in the image.

“There are signs of deterioration in the Heschl’s gyrus portion of your brain, which could explain why you used to suffer from severe bouts of tinnitus.” He explained. “There are only a few things that can cause deterioration like this, one being heavy illicit drug use, and the other would be a psychological disorder like schizophrenia.”

I listened intently, taking in his words. It couldn’t be something like that.

“Although, typically something like that would leave much larger areas of your brain affected and also cause many other physiological changes, which don’t seem to be present.” He said, I felt a little more relieved at this. “We don’t have any reason to keep you here, Mr. Andrews. I assume that years of intense tinnitus may have caused deterioration in the audio processing part of your brain, which may have been what caused the fainting spell you experienced today.”

“So, I’m okay to go home?” I asked.

“I suggest you follow up with a specialist to figure out if they can do anything else for you. I cannot stress this enough, Mr. Andrews. If you leave this alone, things like what happened today could become much more frequent.” He warned.

 

After I got back to my car, I texted Amanda.

*Everything is okay, they said it was vasovagal syncope.*

She replied within a few seconds.

*What’s that?*

*Kind of like vertigo, it’s a spike in cortisol that causes your blood pressure to drop fast and your brain kind of just shuts off.*

*OMG, is it serious?*

*No, it’s usually caused by stress or dehydration. I’m sorry about tonight. I was so nervous about making sure it was a good date.*

*Hey, no problem. Just make it up to me next time, k? ;)*

I felt a flutter in my stomach. Of course, I felt bad about lying to her, but I couldn’t know what they had told me. Not until I sorted all of this out. I started my car and drove home. Once I got there, it was already well past 2 a.m. I quietly entered through my garage and checked on the Hollows' door, still secured. It was late, and I didn’t want to deal with it now. Tomorrow was another day, tomorrow I could figure out their secrets. For now, I needed to sleep.",1,1756958955.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

Male, 21, last month was my birthday.
It's been 3 years since I came to Delhi. In these 3 years, semesters have changed, time has passed, and so many things, including flats and PGs. I just shifted to a flat in July, living alone. The landlord is in the building, other people are there too, but in my room, I'm completely alone. I feel so depressed and disconnected that even when talking to someone, words don't come from the heart. I can't talk properly with family at home either. Friends are almost none. 
There are lots of people, but if I go to college and want to get involved, or want to keep a roommate, but...


I literally have no energy. I don't feel connected to anything at all. I don't feel like studying college subjects, nor, seeing recent times, do I know what to do for govt job prep or where to start. Living alone in the flat, I have to handle all the work myself, and on top of that, tiredness from extra things.
I was going to the gym properly, but after 3-4 months, I quit because I get so tired after coming back from college, and I have to make food and everything myself.


I used to watch movies, but now I can't even enjoy them. My attention span has become very short. Insta and everything else, just looping over and over again.
I had 1 girlfriend, long distance, she joined college recently. With that girl, in the past, there were lots of fights, breakup and separate things, but we're together, but I don't feel connected to her either, nor to any female friend. When I talk to someone, it feels like why am I whining, I can't express myself, no energy to take a stand on things.
College is ending, I've reached 4th year, idk how I'll get a job, what will happen ahead, there's separate stress for that.


 I used to smoke a lot but I've quit now. I'm not addicted to anything else, tea or coffee, just masturbation happens more, watching Reddit and all. Delhi's fucked up weather, no purpose to go out anywhere, water-filled roads, garbage on every street, I live in the Uttam Nagar area 🙏🏻🙏🏻 dude, I'm literally fed up with all these things.

On Reddit, someone idk will see it or not, don't know, but I'm feeling very heavy today. With the long distance girlfriend I have, talks are only for her benefit, get this for me, get that. She didn't used to do it before, but now she does. If I don't give money, she won't take it, the whole day she'll tell her own stories, not interested in listening to mine, she talks about her college stuff. It makes me feel insecure like dude, mine is about to end, I didn't connect at all. Yeah, she explored, had fun, but literally it feels like she doesn't have my memories or my things at all.


Then she talks and goes to sleep, I can't sleep during the day or at night, just keep the laptop on and scroll mobile....... Again and again and again.

Fuck, what should I do to feel easy? A lot of stress and heavy feeling. Even to cry, what do I cry about, the voice doesn't come out, no one to ask. At home, they think I'm enjoying myself, wasting money. I don't even have the courage to ask for extra, fearing they might say I only call for money. And on top of that, in college academics, I'm separately fucked.


My mental and physical health is totally wrecked, fuck dude, I have trouble even breathing. I can't tell anyone, the people here (what do I even call them friends) when I can't talk openly to anyone, idk, I just want to get out of this hollowness, emotional instability, all these things 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

The landlord is in the building, other people are there too, but in my room, I'm completely alone. I feel so depressed and disconnected that even when talking to someone, words don't come from the heart. I can't talk properly with family at home either. Friends are almost none. 
There are lots of people, but if I go to college and want to get involved, or want to keep a roommate, but...


I literally have no energy. I don't feel connected to anything at all. I don't feel like studying college subjects, nor, seeing recent times, do I know what to do for govt job prep or where to start. Living alone in the flat, I have to handle all the work myself, and on top of that, tiredness from extra things.
I was going to the gym properly, but after 3-4 months, I quit because I get so tired after coming back from college, and I have to make food and everything myself.


I used to watch movies, but now I can't even enjoy them. My attention span has become very short. Insta and everything else, just looping over and over again.
I had 1 girlfriend, long distance, she joined college recently. With that girl, in the past, there were lots of fights, breakup and separate things, but we're together, but I don't feel connected to her either, nor to any female friend. When I talk to someone, it feels like why am I whining, I can't express myself, no energy to take a stand on things.
College is ending, I've reached 4th year, idk how I'll get a job, what will happen ahead, there's separate stress for that.


 I used to smoke a lot but I've quit now. I'm not addicted to anything else, tea or coffee, just masturbation happens more, watching Reddit and all. Delhi's fucked up weather, no purpose to go out anywhere, water-filled roads, garbage on every street, I live in the Uttam Nagar area 🙏🏻🙏🏻 dude, I'm literally fed up with all these things.

On Reddit, someone idk will see it or not, don't know, but I'm feeling very heavy today. With the long distance girlfriend I have, talks are only for her benefit, get this for me, get that. She didn't used to do it before, but now she does. If I don't give money, she won't take it, the whole day she'll tell her own stories, not interested in listening to mine, she talks about her college stuff. It makes me feel insecure like dude, mine is about to end, I didn't connect at all. Yeah, she explored, had fun, but literally it feels like she doesn't have my memories or my things at all.


Then she talks and goes to sleep, I can't sleep during the day or at night, just keep the laptop on and scroll mobile....... Again and again and again.

Fuck, what should I do to feel easy? A lot of stress and heavy feeling. Even to cry, what do I cry about, the voice doesn't come out, no one to ask. At home, they think I'm enjoying myself, wasting money. I don't even have the courage to ask for extra, fearing they might say I only call for money. And on top of that, in college academics, I'm separately fucked.


My mental and physical health is totally wrecked, fuck dude, I have trouble even breathing. I can't tell anyone, the people here (what do I even call them friends) when I can't talk openly to anyone, idk, I just want to get out of this hollowness, emotional instability, all these things 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

1n7zyv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n7zyv8/walked_out_on_in_nashville/,Walked out on In Nashville,"I (22 Male) was walked out on by a girl in Nashville that I was friends with for over two years. For background context, I took a friend of mine to Nashville a few weeks ago for a weekend getaway for free. She didn't have to pay for her flight or hotel. The reasoning for this trip was to do something nice for a person who was going through a difficult time in life, and I experienced something similar that she was going through earlier in my life. 

I was friends with this girl for two years and I did a lot of nice things for including taking her to concerts, flying down to see her, and sending her flowers. Given recent events happening in her life, I decided to include her in this trip. I flew into Nashville Thursday afternoon and was having fun until she arrived Friday morning. She got to the hotel Friday morning, and I got her a coffee. Everything was fine during the day on Friday, we saw many of the tourist sites, grabbed food, and drinks. Later, we got to the hotel to get ready to go out for the night, and everything was going great still. We got onto a Broadway rooftop bar, and shortly we left. That's when I noticed something was off with her vibe and energy. I first thought she was tired from an early morning flight and lots of walking... but it didn't get better. She was fun, smiling, and flirty all day. We took a lot of pictures and we laughed together, so the 180 in the mood has left me questioning what could have happened.

  
We woke up on Saturday morning, and I thought things would get better after getting sleep, but I was wrong. We spent part of Saturday at more local shops and tourist attractions. Early in the day, I walked her to a spot to talk and asked her Did I do or say something to upset you... She replied no, this is why I was hesitant about coming. I didn't wanna ruin your trip. I replied, ""You're not. I wanted you to come"". I gave her three ideas of something to do, and I said, Let's do the party bus since last time I was here, I didn't get to do it, and it would be fun. She was on board with the idea, and when I went to buy tickets, she said You go, I don't wanna ruin this for you. We will meet up later. I was hurt but decided to respect her wishes. I went on the party bus and had fun. When the bus wrapped up, I texted her that I was on my way back to the hotel, and when I got back to the room, all her stuff was gone, and she didn't text or leave a note telling me she was leaving. After sending her multiple texts, I finally got a reply saying, ""I'm fine and safe, I just need space, please respect that, and I don't reach out anymore."" 

  
The next day, I ran into her at the airport and felt blindsided, and she didn't really tell me anything. 

When I said this trip meant a lot to me, and you kinda ruined it, she said, ""Give it time and you'll get over it,"" and then I said all those nice things over the years, she just said, ""Well, I appreciate it"" 

I'm searching for closure and trying to move past this. She recently went on to block me on Instagram and unadd me on Snapchat. Do I send a text to her basically saying the feeling is mutual and don't reach back out? I was there for her in difficult times and did a lot of nice things for her, like previously stated.

One of the things that made those restaurants fail was too large of a menu.Sounds a lot like Starbucks doesn't it? I remember when Starbucks was going to simplify the menu but that was a lie instead it just added on a bunch more overly complex multi step drinks that just take extra long to make. Having too large of a menu overwhelms customers and partners alike. It's even worse when you are a new partner and are trying to get a grasp on the basics and all of a sudden an avalanche of new stuff gets dumped on your head.

I remember a long time ago we used to having training pods that went over how to make the new drink and we would actually make and sample it so that we could properly describe how it tastes to the customers. Nowadays you just get tossed recipe cards and get told to sink or swim. This leads me to my next point and that is lack of training. When partners are not trained properly this leads to confusion and inconsistencies that frustrate both customers and partners alike. This leads to drinks being made wrong and unhappy customers. Due to training of the new partners being so rushed or because of the labor cuts they are often thrust onto the floor in a sink or swim situation to fend for themselves because they cannot afford to run the floor with the too few people they were given for the day. When someone is not properly trained and is just thrust onto the floor and told to just survive we can expect less than stellar results.

So far if I ran starbucks I would cut down on the menu significantly. We do not need 1,000 different frapps, I would eliminate the clouds, I would cut down on the amount of cold foam drinks and perhaps even do away with them altogether. I'm not against new innovative ideas I just think that Starbucks as a whole does need to simplify. I think the company does need to go back to it's coffeehouse roots and needs to quit being something it never was. Stop trying to be Sonic, stop trying to be dairy queen, stop trying to be McDonalds and just be yourself. Don't give up what made you unique in the first place to be just another one of those fast food places. I know they don't want to admit they are fast food but they totally are.

I would also pay the partners a living wage and would bring back performance based raises. It's not fair for everyone to get the same flat rate when it's clear some bust their ass harder than others and that should be recognized and rewarded. That's how it used to be when I first hired in (raise wise). When employees are treated well that morale boost catches up to everyone. Employees when treated like humans are more productive, healthier, happier and are less prone to burn out than if they are treated like prisoners in a coffee sweat shop. Customers also feel better about spending their money at a place where they know the employees are treated well. This means they are more than likely to keep giving that company their business.

Labor is something that has consistently been an issue for many years. It's always getting cut and there's never a good reasons as to why except we all know it's because the greedy ones at the top want more money for themselves. Again going back to morale and a company that treats it's employees well, if we had a good labor system we would be making better customer connections, we wouldn't be stressed out, the wait times wouldn't be as long and if we simplified the menu that would help a lot too. Everyone would benefit if every store had enough staff to run properly. Perhaps that so called legendary customer service Starbucks used to pride themselves on would actually become a reality again.

I would also empower the partners and we would no longer sit there and take whatever abuse customers throw at us. If there was one thing that bothered me was what we were just expected to just sit there and take. Nobody deserves to be verbally or physically abused. Nobody deserves to be perved on or groped or made to feel unsafe or uncomfortable at work. I would make it to where there was zero blowback on partners for enforcing Starbucks policies used to cut down on scammers, things that violate the third place such as abuse and I wouldn't make it harder than hell to ban known problematic customers. Partners should never get blowback from enforcing company policy but they do and that needs to stop. Customers shouldn't get recovery cards or any sort of compensation from the company just for being a Karen either. We give too much free stuff away for people who just abuse the baristas on a daily basis.

I would also do away with happy hours. I feel they cheapen the brand and the bring in customers who only come when they can get that deal. I remember working happy hours. I remember the old school one and I remember when they changed it. You see these people only when they are running a deal and then they never come back until the next one. Often they are the cheapest, nastiest types. Do we really want to keep them as customers? They have zero brand loyalty and only come when there is a deal. Granted this could be a way to bring in those who are curious about the company or could convince some to come check us out and they might convert over to being loyal customers but most of the time that's not the case.

The point is that it is only a temporary fix or boost in sales. It's not a sustainable system. More gimmicky drinks is not a permanent solution to boost sales. Giving away free stuff again is not the answer. If you treat the employees well, pay them what they deserve, do certain items and do them well and if you market that correctly I think the company would be better off. If the company goes back to being unique and stops trying to take on the form of Sonic and McDonald's I think that would make a difference.",5,1756957348.0,starbucksbaristas,4,1.0,False

I'm feeling pretty down and isolated lately, and I wanted to see if anyone else in environmental engineering feels the same way. It seems like everyone around me is having the time of their lives, laughing with their friends, and just generally enjoying university. Meanwhile, I'm struggling to connect with people in my program. A big part of this comes from the fact that I got rejected from civil engineering and down to environmental, is anyone else in this boat. 

I've tried joining groups and attending department events, but it's hard to break through the surface-level interactions. Most people seem to already have their friend groups established, and I feel like an outsider trying to force my way in. It's especially tough when I see groups of classmates hanging out or going for coffee together, and I'm just sitting alone, wishing I had that kind of connection.

I know environmental engineering is a challenging field, and we're all under a lot of pressure, but it would be so much easier to get through it with some friends by my side.

Weekdays start early for me, I get up around 7AM. The first thing I do is make coffee, then I check the weather, if a storm is coming in, plans can change rapidly. Around 8:30, I get on the bus to the cultural center where I work. My job is to organize exhibitions, answer visitor questions, and assist with translating materials  When we have an event, it can get busy. Depending on how busy the day was, I get back home by 5 or 6PM. My dinner is usually something warm like a type of stew or fish with potatoes. After I get ready for bed, I usually read or scroll on my phone. If I am not tired yet, I like to bead jewelry or knit while watching a show. I don’t go out much during the week unless there’s live music or someone’s birthday.

On weekends, I sleep in a little, maybe until 9. If the weather looks good, I try to get outside. I enjoy hiking or sometimes I will go fishing with my dad on his boat. Winter activities are different since the weather is all over the place. I usually stay in and knit. I also love crafting traditional beadwork, sewing, and reading books such as Greenlandic literature or anything that helps me understand the world better. Evenings might involve hanging out with friends, having a drink, or just watching the sky. In winter, we look for the northern lights.

*Same-Game Parlay Breakdown for NPB Fans Who Crave a Thrill (and a Laugh)*

---

### Parse the Odds: Giants Favor, But Don’t Count the Swallows Out Yet

The Yomiuri Giants enter this clash as the clear favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **55-57%** (based on -150 to -200 odds across books). The Yakult Swallows, meanwhile, sit at **49-55%**, depending on the platform. The spread leans heavily toward the Giants (-1.5 runs) at prices like **1.37 to 1.48**, while the Swallows’ +1.5 line floats around **2.6 to 2.9**. Totals are tight: **6.5 runs** is the most common line, with the Under priced lower (1.71–1.8) than the Over (1.89–2.15).

**Key Stat to Note**: The Giants’ offense has been a leaky faucet turned into a firehose recently. Their 4-run first inning last game? A masterclass in “show, don’t tell.” Meanwhile, Yakult’s last outing was a 4-2 loss, but let’s not write them off—they’ve got a 20-homer hero in Okamoto, who’s been a *literal* home-run machine in Gifu.

---

### Digest the News: Magic Numbers, Motivation, and Maru’s Midas Touch

The Giants aren’t just playing for pride—they’re chasing the Hanshin Tigers, who have a “magic 6” on the scoreboard. A win here? It’s not just a win; it’s a **“kill the magic”** ritual. The Giants’ recent 3-game streak includes a 5-3 victory where Maru (the team’s golden bat) went 3-for-4 with a triple and two RBIs. His .462 BA in Gifu? More reliable than your morning coffee.

On the flip side, the Swallows are reeling but not broken. Their pitcher, Morita, allowed just 2 runs in 6 innings last time, but can he survive a Giants lineup that’s currently hotter than a yakitori grill? Also, don’t sleep on Okamoto’s return to form—his three consecutive hits last game were the baseball equivalent of a standing ovation.

I posted about an over-pressure safety valve trigger previously: https://www.reddit.com/r/9Barista/s/UVNvQkyccE

https://www.reddit.com/r/9Barista/s/IfOPLwYR0N

After deep descaling twice and seeing no improvement, I contacted support and began a lengthy discussion with them. I thought I'd share some things.

1. While I had no problems not using the basket cap for about a year, it left me vulnerable in this particular scenario–an unexpected high pressure burst blew out part of the puck, causing migration of grounds into the heat exchanger (the central cooling coils).
2. The pressure burst was caused by having the boiler hot but not hot enough, and suddenly switching it to very high heat. Just a slightly change in my daily routine.
3. The cap has another function, supposedly: displacing water in the brew chamber, causing slightly more liquid to come through.

I had stopped using it because I didn't want the silicone basket cap to slowly dissolve over time into my coffee as super hot pressurized water passed over it daily, but with the metal cap now available, I'm more comfortable with the minimal exposure of the o ring it uses.

The only option for me was to buy a new heat exchanger. There was no way to fix it. It was not totally obstructed, but just enough that the pressure valve would start bubbling around the same time water would start flowing through the system.

You tell someone something in confidence and it get spread like a wildfire and gossiped about in such a way that if you don’t participate in the gossip or if you call it out you get ostracized. I recently stood up to a family member for taking something my son said out of context and running to my mother to talk crap (about an eight year old boy) and I lost it. I grabbed my kids and left the family function and haven’t spoken to most of them since. Recently my mother who lives out of state came up for a visit and went out to dinner with my grandmother for what was supposed to be just my mother, my grandmother and my uncle. Basically my grandmother wanted dinner with her children only. After the dinner my mom went back to her apartment for coffee and coincidentally my aunts showed up as well as my uncles girlfriend and niece. This made me feel very intentionally left out. Today I found out that, that night my mother was telling people things I told her in confidence and it got spread around the family like wildfire. This was gut wrenching. I’m trying so hard to create a new culture in my family of trust and honesty and it feels like the only way to do this is to cut everyone off. My family is the type where when we all get together we just bring out the worst in each other.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Adelaide Crows vs. Collingwood Magpies: A Parlay of Power Plays and Pointy Projections**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a finals clash that’s equal parts football and a Shakespearean drama of *“To tag or not to tag, that is the question.”* The Adelaide Crows (1.57 DraftKings H2H) and Collingwood Magpies (2.35) meet in a qualifying final where emotions run hotter than a pie shop in August. Let’s dissect this like a butcher at a meat market—precision, flair, and a dash of dark humor.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (But They Might Trip Over Shoelaces)

Adelaide is the chalk here, with implied probabilities of **61–64% to win** (thanks to 1.57–1.65 odds). Collingwood’s 43–47% implied chances feel like a “respect the opponent” nod from bookmakers. The spread? Adelaide -8.5 with both teams at 1.87, suggesting a tight contest where the Crows need to outscore by *at least a coffee can full of goals*. The total is 160.5 (1.87), implying a high-scoring affair.

**Key stats to chew on**:

* Adelaide’s last win over Collingwood was a *37-71 inside-50 deficit* but still a three-point victory. Like a baker with a broken oven—Collingwood had all the dough, but Adelaide still pulled off a croissant.
* Collingwood’s Dan McStay and Jeremy Howe are out, while Adelaide’s Max Michalanney and Luke Pedlar return. The Crows’ cavalry charges into battle with fresh legs.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Mind Games, and a Side of Salt

Adelaide’s Izak Rankine is banned for a homophobic slur, a shame because his absence leaves a hole in their attack. But Coach Matthew Nicks isn’t just a tactician—he’s a *master of psychological warfare*. By moving Max Michalanney to forward, Nicks is playing chess while Collingwood’s playing checkers. “We might have done that deliberately to take you guys off track,” he smirked. Spoiler: It worked.

Collingwood, meanwhile, is missing key defen

It is both indispensable and pragmatic, and while the UN has six principal organs on paper, in a very real sense only one of them really matters. The Security Council is the only body that produces binding resolutions. The General Assembly can pass declarations all day; they bind no one. ECOSOC can shuffle budgets and administer aid; useful, but not decisive. Even the International Court of Justice issues judgments that are meaningless without state consent, enforcement is beyond it prerogative. The Council is where power is concentrated—because it is the only place in the UN system where politics, not symbolism, is at stake (The statistical aspects of the Secretariat are also very important, as are a lot of ECOSOC-based organizations, but I'm mostly going to ignore them for now. And the UNSC generally has some control over the appointment of people to key positions within such ministries).

The Council has fifteen members. Five are permanent, ten rotate on regional quotas:

* Africa: 3 seats
* Asia-Pacific: 2 non-permanent + China’s permanent seat
* Eastern Europe: 1 non-permanent + Russia’s permanent seat
* Latin America & Caribbean: 2 seats
* Western Europe & Others: 2 non-permanent + UK, France, US as permanent

That means in practice only one Eastern European state ever rotates in, since Russia holds the permanent slot, and only two Asia-Pacific states rotate alongside China. Africa has the largest share of non-permanent seats, three, though “largest share of impotence” might be the more accurate description. The permanent members are the ones that matter, because they carry the veto, and everything else is mostly noise. It should be said their votes do matter, and they are courted, but non-permanent members of the UNSC generally do not develop the same level of expertise in the workings of the Council, and they generally lack the ancillary staff to really be capable of mastering its techniques. They are not going to develop the same pool of talent and knowledge bases that a permanent member does. So while occasionally non-permanent members, like say those in the G4, which will be mentioned later, are able to really make themselves heard, in general most of the time a non-permanent member follows the permanent members (even when they are voting against them). 

Why was it designed this way? Because without it there would be no UN at all. International law is anarchic: small states can be bullied, but large sovereigns cannot be bound. The United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, China, and France were too big to coerce in 1945 and remain too big today. Sovereignty, in its rawest sense, is the ability to say no and make it stick. A sovereign is above law because it is the law, unless it chooses to surrender some of that authority. So the P5 were given their permanent seats because without them there would be no Charter, no UN, nothing.

The P5 themselves reflect power and politics at the end of World War II. The United States, the USSR, and the UK were essential. France was weak but too noisy to exclude, so it was grandfathered in. China was weaker still but included to placate the “rest of the world” and lend the illusion of universality. The principle is not governments but states-as-constructs: the ROC’s seat became the PRC’s; the USSR’s became Russia’s.

Reform is where the fantasy sets in. Every few years someone announces the need to democratize or rebalance the Council. The main reform proposals right now basically sort into three buckets. The G4—Japan, India, Germany, Brazil—want to be permanent members themselves. Their enthusiasm is matched only by the indifference or hostility of everyone else. The so-called Coffee Club, spearheaded by states like Italy, Pakistan, Mexico, and Egypt (with backing from others such as Poland, South Korea, Argentina, and occasionally China and France [contrast this with the G4 to figure out why]), argues instead for more non-permanent seats. Their logic is transparent: they don’t want their regional rivals sitting permanently at the top table. Africa, meanwhile, wants at least one permanent African seat, rotating or collective, to reflect the fact that Africa is the Council’s most frequent subject. Pacific Island states occasionally make similar noises about representation.

Then there is veto reform, which is the most utopian of all. Secretaries-General and smaller states like to float it, but the simple fact is that none of the P5 will ever vote to curtail their own privileges. The veto is crippling, yes, but it is also the cornerstone of the institution. Without it, the UN would never have been created. It guarantees paralysis, but it also guarantees survival.

My own view is that the only plausible reforms lie in tinkering with the non-permanent seats: longer terms, perhaps more seats, maybe a modest regional reshuffle. Anything touching the veto is pure speculation. The veto will be reformed only on the day the UN itself is reforged, when the Charter is ripped up and rewritten. Until then, it is not reformable.

So the Security Council remains what it was always meant to be: the least “UN” part of the UN. It is not a parliament of nations, it is an institutionalized cartel of great powers. And until the distribution of global power changes so dramatically that the current arrangement collapses, that is exactly how it will stay.",5,1756956061.0,DeepStateCentrism,9,1.0,False

I know, I know. I probably should’ve known this fact going into college and part of me did but it’s just kinda hit me full force and I’m truly crushed. 

I feel like a complete idiot to even think a degree was enough in the first place. I used to think of myself as a highly capable individual, I mean I still do but literally everyone else is too.

In my naive spoiled head I left high school thinking the world was populated by mediocre monkeys that were beneath me. I know how horrible it sounds but I’m just being honest. In high school I was your textbook A+ high achieving student that had yet to experience failure. 

Oh I got a 99 percentile SAT score? I must be a top one percenter! Oh I go to a highly ranked business school? That must guarantee me a high salary! I’m set! 

Fast forward to college and I’m surrounded by people who are better than me in literally every facet of the human existence. Let me tell you, that shit crushed my ego harder than anything ever had. Better late than never though. 

But even after being humbled I still thought that if I kept up with my grades and got my degree I’d be set. WRONG. 

In reality I need to: keep up with my grades, get into highly competitive pre-professional student orgs, network with my peers despite being a huge introvert, learn how to elevator pitch myself to hiring managers at career fairs, message countless people a day asking for a coffee chat in hopes that %1 of them will reply, secure pre-professional certifications and pass the exams for them, educate myself on interview technical questions that my degree DOESN’T EVEN TEACH ME HOW TO DO, perform under the high pressure of an interview for multiple rounds at countless different companies with the hope that just one of them eventually accepts me. Then I can have the privilege to slave away to corporate greed! Perhaps I’m just not a hard worker but it all just feels so overwhelming.

Life sucks man. I miss being a naive narcissistic kid. College is genuinely the biggest scam ever. A full year of classes and I’ve learned approximately zero relevant or useful information that will benefit me or my future. I’m seriously debating just spiraling into homelessness at this point, it’s so depressing. I literally go to one of the best schools in the country for my major and yet I feel this way.

Sounds harsh? Good. Because sugar-coating reality never helped anyone climb out of mediocrity.

## The Excuse Factory Is Always Open 🏭

We've become masters at crafting elaborate stories about why things didn't work out:

**""I wasn't meant for success""**  
**""The timing wasn't right""**  
**""I'm just unlucky""**  
**""It's not my fault""**

But here's the uncomfortable truth: while you were building these convenient narratives, someone else with the same 24 hours was building their dreams.

## The Scrolling Trap That's Stealing Your Future 📱

Every minute you spend mindlessly scrolling through social media is a minute someone else is spending:

✅ Learning a new skill  
✅ Building their business  
✅ Reading something valuable  
✅ Creating instead of consuming  
✅ Taking action toward their goals  

Your phone isn't just entertaining you - it's literally programming you for failure. Each swipe is a tiny vote for staying exactly where you are.

## The Sleep-When-You-Should-Work Syndrome 😴

**Scenario 1:** You come home tired, collapse on the couch, and tell yourself you'll start tomorrow.

**Scenario 2:** Someone else comes home tired, sits at their desk anyway, and puts in one more hour toward their future.

Guess which person will be complaining about their life in five years? And guess which one will be living their dream?

The difference isn't talent. It's not luck. It's the choice you make in that moment when you're tired.

## Your Effort Meter Is Broken 📊

Here's a reality check: **What you think is ""enough"" probably isn't.**

When you say you've tried everything, you've probably tried everything *comfortable*. You've probably given 60% effort and expected 100% results.

Real success requires:
- Showing up when you don't feel like it
- Pushing through when it gets boring
- Continuing when progress feels invisible
- Working harder when everyone else gives up

---

## The Consistency Gap That's Killing Your Dreams ⚡

**Average person:** Motivated for 3 days, quits for 10 days, gets motivated again, quits again.

**Successful person:** Shows up every single day, even when motivation is nowhere to be found.

The magic isn't in perfect days. It's in refusing to have zero days. Even 1% effort is infinitely better than 0% effort.

---

## Stop Waiting for Permission to Win 🚀

Nobody is coming to save you. No perfect moment will arrive. No magical opportunity will fall from the sky.

**Your future self is counting on present you to:**

🔥 Stop making excuses  
🔥 Start taking responsibility  
🔥 Work when you don't want to  
🔥 Learn instead of scroll  
🔥 Build instead of consume  
🔥 Push through instead of give up

## The Brutal Math of Success 🧮

**Time spent making excuses = 0% return on investment**  
**Time spent working on yourself = Compound returns for life**

Every excuse you make today is a loan against your future happiness. And the interest rate is brutal.

---

## Your Comfort Zone Is Your Danger Zone ⚠️

The place where you feel safe and comfortable is exactly where your dreams go to die. Growth happens in the space between where you are and where you want to be - and that space is always uncomfortable.

**Comfortable choices create difficult lives**  
**Difficult choices create comfortable lives**

Which path are you choosing every day?

## The Success Recipe Nobody Wants to Follow 📝

**Step 1:** Stop blaming external factors  
**Step 2:** Take complete responsibility for your results  
**Step 3:** Identify exactly what you need to do  
**Step 4:** Do it consistently, especially when you don't want to  
**Step 5:** Repeat until you win  

There's no secret sauce. No hidden trick. No shortcut. Just the boring, unglamorous work of showing up every day.

---

## The Choice That Changes Everything 🔄

Right now, you have a choice:

**Option A:** Close this article, go back to your comfortable routines, and stay exactly where you are.

**Option B:** Use this discomfort as fuel to finally demand more from yourself.

Your future is being written by your choices today. Every single choice is a vote for the person you're becoming.

---

## The Time to Start Was Yesterday 🕐

The second best time is right now.

Not when you feel ready. Not when conditions are perfect. Not when you have more time, money, or energy.

**Right. Now.**

Your excuses will still be there tomorrow if you want them. But so will your regrets.

---

## Your New Operating System 💻

**Old mindset:** ""Why do bad things happen to me?""  
**New mindset:** ""What can I learn from this and how can I improve?""

**Old mindset:** ""I don't have time""  
**New mindset:** ""How can I make time for what matters?""

**Old mindset:** ""I'm not good at this""  
**New mindset:** ""I'm not good at this yet""

**Old mindset:** ""It's too hard""  
**New mindset:** ""It's hard, and I'm doing it anyway""

---

## The Bottom Line Truth 🎯

Success isn't mysterious. It's not reserved for special people. It's not about having perfect circumstances.

**Success is about:**
- Working when others rest
- Learning when others scroll
- Pushing when others quit
- Showing up when others make excuses
- Taking responsibility when others blame

The universe doesn't owe you anything. But your consistent effort owes you everything.

**The question isn't whether you can change your life.**  
**The question is whether you will.**

Your move. 🎲

He constantly bought her gifts and they called each other from time to time, and she tells me how awesome he is and she could never say no to him. 

I mentioned how this dude is thirsty and i myself don’t deal with thirsty men because they screw it up for everyone for a whiff of validation and it’s damned uncomfortable tbh, got called a sexist and how she always chooses the guy over anything. I resigned and said it’s ok then, i prefer not to hear about him. 

I did hear about him, lots of times she brought him up in conversations, and i repeatedly expressed that i explicitly do not want to hear that name ever again. Her response ""You can’t police my language like that! You are insecure and jealous! Even my guy friend said you’re oppressive"" I ignored her, went to the gym nobody needs shaming like that over my boundary.

I reflected. 

Why is that women think they can have it all and not understand that this will cause conflict in relationships? And i realized my gf had no empathy and didn’t put herself into my shoes. There was no thought ""what does my boyfriend think of me, if i go to a coffee with my good male friend?"" Everything made sense now. This is why for some women a man with boundaries causes problems, they do not understand how others perceive the way they act and get irritated when someone mentions something. It all made sense now, i was just a set-piece in her self absorbed one woman show. 

GF came over and said this guy friend will be here and visit our city for a week, she’ll have a coffee with him and show him around. She tried to seduce me and I escaped her touch and stood up. She started panicking and couldn’t understand why i was rejecting her. 

Deep down i cringed the hell out of her touching me, i told her that i'm not attracted to her, right now. 

I could not see her in a romantic way anymore. It’s like having a complete stranger in your apartment all the memories just vanished. Over the years there was so much drama surrounding this guy, i went completely numb.

She’s still crying heavily and is shaking and can’t calm down, i didn’t cared i haven’t asked for this. Told her i don’t date women who meet up with guy friends and she needs to go. I can’t tell you what to do, but i can tell you to stay the fuck out of my life.

She picked up her stuff, and went.

I blocked her nr. and ghosted her.

1n7zca7,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1n7zca7/is_this_egg_intolerance/,Is this egg intolerance ?,"For context I have recently returned to a keto diet after being off of it for about a year. During my break I returned to a carbohydrate based diet and during that time I didn’t consume eggs where they were a staple while on keto. I never had any problems with them. 

I have had a lot of trouble transitioning back to keto and all my problems I chalked up to the return to the diet itself. I have had lethargy, bloating etc which I know is normal when starting keto. 

Yesterday for the first time on keto I fasted as I wasn’t hungry at all. I woke up feeling really good for the first time and had a great amount of energy and thought everything was great until I ate breakfast which consisted of black coffee and eggs. 

After eating I took a shower to prepare to leave the house and now I feel like I’ve been ran over by a truck. All the energy I had is gone, I’m feeling bloated in my stomach and have a headache. 

Another oddity is when I eat eggs I break out in a sweat. I thought it was due to the high protein found in eggs which the body requires more energy to break down. 

In any case I’m going to remove them from my diet and see what difference that makes. 

Does this sound like an egg intolerance ? I don’t think it’s an allergy as I have no skin symptoms or breathing issues. 

Does an intolerance normally react this fast ? 

If it is an intolerance what would have caused this intolerance to occur ? Is it not consuming them for over a year ?

1n7z30q,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1n7z30q/byeline_chapter_two/,[BYE-LINE] - Chapter Two,"The office of The Las Vegas Weekly Wierdo reeks of burnt coffee and hot toner. The office is just two rooms. Frankie Cross doesn't mind the size; she likes that everyone shares a cramped space. Stacks of papers everywhere, boxes filled with unsold zines or electronics cover the walls and bleed into the sections between desks. The ancient chipped wooden floor is only visible from the small paths leading to and from the copier, the desks, and the break room.

It's the stink she hates.

Frankie slouches in her wooden chair. Her puffy jacket engulfs her. She stares at the photocopier shoved next to her desk as Lorna, big-haired and southern, feeds the pages of this week's zines through the copier. She'll be there for an hour, easy.

Frankie spins her fidget spinner. She runs her tongue across her teeth. One of these days, she'll take a bat to that machine.

Lorna hums a song—something from the fifties. She taps a chunky gold ring against the side of the copier. Her fingers stained green from rubbing against the cheap gold. Frankie's gaze travels from Lorna's finger to her own. Rough cuticles, chipped purple nail polish, the same color as her shoes. She gives her fidget spinner another spin.

Claire, Frankie's photographer and a self-proclaimed psychic, sits cross-legged on an upside-down milk crate. She hums along and snaps test shots with her new iPhone camera lens. She leans close to a cactus on the desk and takes a photo. Frowns. Then takes another. She adjusts the brightness, her brows knit, her tongue poking out of the side of her mouth.

Frankie swivels in her chair, then stands. She heads to Tony's side of the office and leans against the bookshelf. Claire follows, her wooden beads clacking loudly.

A young man sits across from Tony. He's talking fast, his voice shaky. Tony nods along, scribbling notes on a pad. Tony's old tape recorder between them. From back when he was a legitimate journalist and forty pounds lighter.

""I can't sleep. I've been up for days,"" the guy says. He grips the front of his jeans, his leg bouncing a mile a minute.

""He's watching me. always.""

""The Preacher,"" Tony adds.

""Yes. And the color.""

""The one you can't describe."" Tony leans back, straining the buttons on the front of his shirt. ""We'll hit up a paint shop, get some swatches, give you some options. We'll find it.""

""No. It's not that I don't know the color; I know colors. But this one—this one's not a normal color, it's…"" He gestures frantically. ""Indescribable.""

Tony nods and scribbles more notes.

The man leans back, sighs, and yanks at his hair.

Frankie spins her fidget spinner and stares. The guy's a wreck: messy hair, wrinkled shirt, stained jeans.

""Cross!"" Tony yells, then spots her. ""Good, I've got a new assignment for you. Guy saw God in his drywall. Headline writes itself!""

""What? No. I'm on the Nude Sand Sculpture Competition. You promised!""

""Yeah, you promised us buns. Lots of em!"" Claire adds.

""Glenn's got it now,"" Tony says.

""Yes!"" Glenn shouts from across the office. ""Finally, something with class!""

Frankie leans around the bookshelf and glares at Glenn from across the room. He gives her a wide, smug smile. ""Try not to get converted, Cross.""

Frankie draws a finger across her neck. ""Your death will be slow, Glenn.""

She turns back to Tony. ""You did the same thing with the Annual Alan Convention!""

“Yeah, we were supposed to judge who looked the most ‘Alan’ among them! I looked forward to it all year.”

""Do you want to disappoint this charming little girl again?"" Frankie gestures to Claire, who pouts.

""I'm eighteen,"" Claire mutters. ""Not a little girl.""

""Forget her. You want to screw over your best reporter, again?""

Glen laughs. Loud. Frankie whips around and glares.

""I will hang you by those dorky suspenders!""

""Enough!"" Tony yells. He jabs a stubby finger at them. ""Cross, you and Voyant are on Preacher duty.""

""Yes, sir,"" they say in unison.

The guy shrinks into his chair. His fingers dig into his jeans. Claire stares at him. Sighs. Looks down and chews her lip.

Claire walks over and kneels. ""Mind if I do a quick vibe check?""

He looks around, confused.

Frankie shrugs.

Tony leans back in his chair. ""It's her thing.""

""Okay.""

She breathes in. Holds it. Exhales and sets her hands on his. His grip on his jeans loosens. She closes her eyes and breathes again.

The young man fidgets in his seat.

Claire opens her eyes and smiles. ""We need to take this one.""

Frankie sighs and rolls her eyes. ""Fine.""

""Great!"" Tony jumps to his feet. ""Now, everyone, get the hell out!""

 

 

Frankie kicks the front door open and steps into the harsh Vegas sun. She carries a milk crate filled with cables, EMF meters, and other spirit-hunting junk.

Claire skips after her, her tote bouncing against her hip and her sandals slapping against the pavement. She heads for the passenger side of Frankie's beat-up Outback.

Glenn jogs behind.

“No hard feelings, right?”

Frankie doesn't answer.

He sprints ahead and yanks the back door open. Frankie dumps the boxes in without looking at him.

“There’s gonna be women modeling at this sand sculpture thing, right?” Glenn asks, grinning like a creep.

Frankie slams the trunk shut and turns, all smile.

“No, Glenn. All male nudes. Geared for a very specific male audience.” She steps closer. ""You'll be *very* popular."" She snaps one of his suspenders.

She walks around the car and climbs in.

“What do you mean?”

Frankie doesn't answer. She shuts the door.

Claire beams. “Enjoy the hunky butts, you lucky ducky!” she hits her pink vape, exhaling a marshmallow-scented cloud, and climbs in. “Take pics!”

The engine coughs. Catches, then they pull away from the curb.

Glenn stands in the middle of the street. His hands limp at his sides.

1n7yy96,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanweather/comments/1n7yy96/high_pressure_vs_low_pressure_and_something/,"High Pressure vs Low Pressure, and something happens.  Plus an update on T15 expected rainfall through this afternoon."," Checking the charts again during my 3rd coffee break of the morning, and I found a perfect example of how T15 is feeding off of a high pressure system in the south central Pacific Ocean.  Take a look at the graphic attached.  To paraphrase on loyal reader on this sub, ""High pressure meets low pressure, and stuff happens.""

 In a nutshell, that's it.  The first, immutable, eternal rule of anything in the meteorological world is: Air always moves from high pressure to low.  Always.  This is the first and greatest law of weather science.  This elemental movement is what gives us wind.  And, from that, everything else derives.  

 We have a textbook case of this happening now.  T15 is sitting off the Kyushu coast with a central pressure of about 1000 hPa while, a few hundred kilometers to the east, a large dome of high pressure is sitting at 1016 hPa.  Like releasing an overinflated balloon, air flows from the high pressure system to the low.  Except it doesn't do it in a straight line.  Because of the rotation of the earth, both the high and the typhoon are rotating.  The high pressure clockwise rotation throws air way down south to the Marianas and lower, scooping up even more of that hot, rich, moist tropical air, then brings it up to T15 which, is pulling air in.  This mechanism is giving T15 added fuel to keep it going even as it moves northward.

And, as a result, T15 is kicking off a lot of rain today.  The JMA has released their afternoon rainfall prediction and it looks heavy, especially around southern Kyushu and Shikoku.  It's a little counter-intuitive, but when looking at this chart, keep in mind that orange means heavy rain, yellow a little lighter, and shades of blue lighter beyond that.

 Parts of Kansai, southern Mie and area of Aichi and Gifu prefectures are expected to rainfalls of over 20mm in the afternoon, between 3-6pm.  Other spotty areas of heavy rain will fall up toward Kanto in that time as well.  Lighter rainfall of between 10-20mm is expected to fall in the Chugoku area and much of Kansai in the same timeframe.

She bought two of them and is asking for feedback on whether it's cute. It's manipulative for her to buy two of them and then keep telling her chat she's not sure they look good on her. Reese bought more jewelry today too, so she clearly doesn't care that she allegedly has to pay thousands of dollars for her recent visit to the emergency room. She's not saving money for her move either, but some viewers are continuing to enable her reckless shopping habits.   
  
""Don't worry,"" she tells the woman who has been repeatedly superchatting her for a long time to read a very important email. Reese claims reading that email is at the top of her list. She says she has watched the show Girls over and over since it has come out. A chatter who claims to be a longtime lurker makes a comment in the chat and Reese makes a big deal out of saying that lurkers who join her chat take priority. ""I need you to come out,"" Reese tells her.   
  
Reese forgot to adjust the thermostat and says she might get cold and need to call out to H so he can adjust it for her. She went back to T.J. Maxx today and spent $15 on a ring with lab-created rubies. I think Reese's attitude toward shopping is that she can buy a lot of stuff as long as it's on sale, she gets a discount or each item only costs a few dollars. She seems to have no comprehension how quickly those costs add up and she's just expecting that other people will bail her out when she wants more money.   
  
Reese says she asked the woman at the jewelry counter when T.J. Maxx would be getting more turquoise. She took Reese's phone number and promised to call her when more turquoise pieces come in. When she gets more than a little negative feedback on the handkerchief, Reese takes it off and says she'll donate it to somebody.   
  
She's getting her Outshine the Fox tattoo finished tomorrow. Reese says she loves turquoise and gold but it's not easy to find. After buying her new ring, she did other shopping at T.J. Maxx and got really angry after walking into ""a fresh, hot fart."" She says she got loud and started asking ""Who did this?"" Then Reese claims she thought to herself that she's trying to be more like Christ so she's only going to wish for the person who farted to wake up tomorrow to find a single pubic hair in their coffee, not a whole tuft.   
  
Chatters are asking Reese if she has started reading her children's Bible yet.   
  
Reese asks how Jared the Subway guy didn't get a life sentence after what he did to children when Danny Masterson is spending so much time in prison for the rapes he committed.   
  
She says she doesn't know how to go on TikTok and she needs some friends who aren't her mods to upload videos for her. Reese's learned helplessness continues to be off the charts. She has been promising for two years that she would learn to do some basic things for herself as a content creator, but she still hasn't done that. Reese says if people don't volunteer to help create a Relatable Reese TikTok presence ""it's no big deal and we'll just continue to fail.""   
  
Reese holds up one of the silk chains she recently bought on Etsy for $2 each and finds a flaw in it. ""Quite honestly, I probably won't wear this color at all,"" she says, putting it aside. She hollers to H more than once and asks him to turn the thermostat up. She repeats her usual jokes about why people shouldn't eat food samples at Costco or go to buffets.   
  
Reese's Bible superchatter spends $10 to share a verse telling Reese to forgive anyone who offends her.   
  
People have come out of the woodwork since Reese has started learning about God and saying she wants to be more Christ-like, Reese says. Reese really doesn't like it that a lot of people are telling her what God does and doesn't love and want from his followers. ""What are you doing?"" she asks.   
  
Reese says she likes it when people tell her that she's going to do big things with God and give her only positive affirmations about her relationship with God. She says she doesn't care if people have read the Bible 450 times. They still shouldn't be giving her advice on what the God of the Bible says or what he wants, she says. ""God wants you to just do what you think is right,"" she says. Reese, you seriously need to read the Bible if you're going to continue to claim you want to be more Christ-like. The Bible doesn't teach that God's followers should just do whatever they think is right.   
  
Reese claims that what the God of the Bible wants is very simple to her. ""Do what you would want done unto you,"" she says.   
  
LizTrix told Reese on a Zoom call that maybe she should educate herself about a bunch of religions because she thinks there's a little bit of truth to every single religion. ""I think that's a beautiful thing,"" Reese says. It is a beautiful thing if you would start to be serious about it, Reese. You haven't even started reading the Bible yet to know what the teachings of Jesus are. Abigayle sent you a verse last week where Jesus says no one comes to God except through him. ""I don't think there's one right way,"" Reese says.   
  
Reese says a bunch of people are warning her to stay away from certain groups because they're cults and they're telling her what God wants. ""For God's sake, please stop,"" she says. ""If I were God, I wouldn't like that at all."" Reese has a personal relationship with God and other people need to stay in their own lanes, she says.  
  
Reese says she's excited with what she's learning about God but she's never going to say she thinks other people on her channel should follow God too. ""I'm not going to be fucking weird about it,"" she says. ""I'm not going to say God wants **that** for **you**.""   
  
Her Bible superchatter spends another $10 to tell Reese that Christians have a reputation for being pushy. Reese says God doesn't have go-betweens who give her advice on what she should do. ""I go straight to the front of the line,"" she says. ""... Please don't step in between my relationship with God.""   
  
Hey Reese, I think a lot of people are trying to give you advice because you're not reading the Bible for yourself and you say you just want to have these discussions about God with your whole channel. They're trying to spoon-feed you information that you have been unwilling to research.   
  
Reese says she may or may not do some research into other religions even though a lot of people in Sunday's Zoom call were nodding when LizTrix said it would be good for Reese to do that. Reese used to freak out and write people up as a Scientologist if she heard other people saying ""LRH says ..."" Scientologists are supposed to be able to show the specific policy where L. Ron Hubbard says something, Reese says.   
  
LizTrix spends $20 to tell Reese that no one can say what God wants for someone else.   
  
A chatter asks Reese if she thinks Christianity is a cult. Reese says she doesn't think so, but she adds that if she were asked what Christianity is she couldn't give an educated answer. ""I don't want to step on anybody's toes,"" she says. This issue is going to get a lot more complicated for Reese if she keeps talking about wanting to be more Christ-like. She said earlier this week that she understands a lot about who God is. She's wearing crosses and saying she wants to be more Christ-like, but when people ask if Christianity is a cult, Reese pleads ignorance. She wants to have her cake and eat it too.

Reese says tonight that she wouldn't say she's a Christian. ""I just know I have a beautiful relationship with God,"" she says, adding that the story of Jesus changed her life last week. ""I just need you to love me and support me,"" Reese says, adding that she doesn't need an interpreter or a translator about God.   
  
Reese claims tonight that she doesn't worry, but then she clarifies to say she worries about her health and about how she's going to pay certain bills but she doesn't worry that the world is going to end. ""God is not a mean, scary person ... so back off,"" she says just a couple of minutes after confirming that she still hasn't started reading the Bible, not even a children's version. Reese asks if it isn't true that people aren't supposed to judge others.   
  
One of Reese's fans asks if she has thought about writing her father a letter. Many people have encouraged Reese to write her dad a letter and then burn it instead of sending it to him. Reese says she has thought about it and she probably won't do it.   
  
Reese is answering more questions from her chat tonight without popping them up on the screen or telling everyone who's listening what the question is. Sometimes she gives a lot of significant information that way and reading her chat could help wake more of her fans up to how she manipulates people.

A woman who came to Reese's Nashville meet-up asks if H's father has already moved to San Francisco.   
  
A chatter asks to see a photo of Reese's father and Reese shows a photo of her dad smiling and holding H when he was a toddler. ""My dad met H once,"" Reese says. She has never admitted that on her channel before as far as I can remember. For a long time, she insisted that her dad had completely abandoned her life the day that Dan O'Connor hit her with a fax machine, but then Reese admitted that her dad came back into her life for a while when she was in her 20s and he even spent nights at her place. She changes her stories a lot and then acts like those changes are no big deal.   
  
She claims her dad met H at an event at the Kansas City org when she was there. ""Do you think my dad looks like me?"" she asks her chat, showing a different picture of his face. He's smiling and he has H on his shoulders. Reese says her dad spends seven or eight months a year in Clearwater. She shows more pictures of H and his dad, Michael. Reese shows pictures of her mom and the two of them look so much alike.   
  
A chatter tells Reese she just discovered one of her ancestors was on the Mayflower. ""That's amazing,"" Reese tells her. Reese acts so dumb about history and she insisted this year she didn't know why or how Americans celebrate the Fourth of July, but somehow she knows exactly what the Mayflower is. Keilah, who used to be very close to Reese and did a lot of behind-the-scenes work for Reese's channel, has warned that Reese knows a lot more than she claims she does.   
  
""God is your best friend. That's how I see God,"" Reese says. ""He only wants good things for me."" She growls ""God doesn't like that"" and then asks why people say that. ""Why are you being so negative?"" she asks, adding that God created everyone and wants the best for everyone.

Her Bible superchatter spends another $10 to send Reese a Psalm and tell her to keep in mind that God made her and he is perfect.   
  
After Reese repeats many things she's said before about Michael, she says that H is much closer to Michael now. She says in the past several years, H didn't have much of a relationship with Michael but that was mostly her fault because she got declared and Michael's parents are dedicated Scientologists. ""That screwed up a lot of things,"" she says. Michael's parents have pretty much disconnected from him, which has really harmed him. Reese admits that harm is because of her. ""It's made him probably not reach out as much,"" she says.   
  
H and his dad really bonded during the three weeks he was in Kansas City this summer, Reese says. ""They talk all the time,"" she says, adding that Michael called her crying near the end of H's visit and he told her that he didn't want H to leave.   
  
Reese's Bible superchatter spends another $5 to send a verse for Michael that says God heals the brokenhearted. ""Abigayle, you are a saint ... and thank you for praying for him,"" Reese says. She says she'll never forgive Scientology or Michael's parents for abandoning him the way they did.   
  
Her Bible superchatter spends another $10 to send a closing verse from the book of Job saying ""Be on guard! Turn back from evil for God sent this suffering to keep you from a life of evil.""",2,1756954689.0,OT42,0,1.0,False

we even made plans to get coffee after class and just talk. but as things progressed, he explained he wasn’t emotionally available (just got out of a relationship) and basically just wanted to hang and talk as friends, but also have sex. i said i was down.

we were talking pretty consistently for a couple days, but i noticed he only really seemed interested in talking sexually. if we weren’t talking sexually, he was conveniently too busy or tired.

two days ago, he said he’d been feeling down the whole day abt his ex and doesn’t want to talk anymore, only in class. he said he thought he was “ready to get to know someone knew” but isn’t. i said that’s fine, but i felt weird.

first of all, we have class together and i have to see him every week, so it’s going to be so awkward. we spoke very sexually and i even sent him explicit pics (not fully naked, but still). secondly, i feel like the ex thing is an excuse bc he was fine being super sexual like the day prior.

it sucks because i embarrassed and naive for trying to talk to him as friends, he probably felt overwhelmed. but the thing is, he was the one who mentioned being friends and he approached me first. i wish he would’ve been honest about what he wanted bc i would be down for strictly hooking up.

i guess i wanna ask for advice on how can i make things less awkward in class? bc i have so much anxiety thinking about it. also, maybe some clarity on what his mindset/intentions might be because i’m very inexperienced with this stuff. i wish there was a way to reconcile, even if it’s just hooking up, because i’m really attracted to him and i’m frustrated and disappointed.

please help !! :(

TL;DR: a guy in class approached me wanting to be FWB. at first, he said he wanted to hang and talk and friends, but later on he seemed only interested in talking sexually. couple days ago, he said he didn’t want to talk/see each other anymore. i want advice on how to make class less awkward. also, on if there’s any change for reconciliation or help me better understand his mentality.",1,1756954127.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

Been living here for 5+ years and tired of people saying there’s “nothing to do” here. Yes, we’re not Hollywood or Downtown LA, but we’ve got some solid spots that actually make this place pretty cool. Here’s my personal list of attractions that are worth your time:

Nature/Outdoor Stuff:

	•	Placerita Canyon Nature Center - Not just hiking trails, they have live animals and the waterfall trail is gorgeous after rain

	•	William S. Hart Park - Has a legit bison herd and mini zoo that most people don’t know about

	•	Whitney Canyon Waterfall - Easy 3.5 mile hike to an actual waterfall (shocking, I know)

	•	Castaic Lake - Busiest rec lake in LA County for a reason. Great for fishing/boating

	•	Vasquez Rocks - 15 min drive north but iconic rock formations (yes, from Star Trek)

Food Spots That Actually Hit:

	•	The Loaf - Best bakery/coffee combo. Their Sea Salt Matcha Cold Brew is chef’s kiss

	•	Royal Tandoor - Legitimately some of the best Indian food in LA County

	•	Mr. Bacano - Colombian fast food with burgers that will ruin other burgers for you

	•	Mom Can Cook Thai Kitchen - Don’t sleep on Canyon Country side of town

Family/Date Night:

	•	MB2 Racing - Go-karts and mini golf that’s actually fun for adults

	•	Ice skating rink by Valencia HS - Where the LA Kings practice AND they filmed The Office episode “Threat Level Midnight”

	•	All Locked Up/Arcane - Multiple escape room locations that are surprisingly well done

	•	Sidecar Market - Speakeasy vibes, make reservations

Free Entertainment:

	•	Concerts in the Park - Every Saturday July/August at Central Park. Actually good bands

	•	Farmers Market - Sundays at COC, way better than it used to be
	•	Old Town Newhall - Small but decent bar/restaurant scene developing

Unique SCV Things:

	•	Gibbon Conservation Center - Seriously one-of-a-kind globally

	•	Central Park Disc Golf - Great beginner course
	•	Trek Bike Park - Mountain biking paradise if that’s your thing

Real talk - the best part about SCV is you get suburban peace but you’re 45 minutes from literally everything LA has to offer via Metrolink.

5:45am

I just want it all to stop. After some restless hours, I am awake again, wrapped in sheets, finally comfortable, as morning light seeps in the edges of my blackout curtains.

The garbage truck outside trundles down the street, exhausting loudly as it tips and drops. 

My housemate gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom down the hall. I feel nervous, although I keep the bathroom clean, I have been throwing up a lot. I hate this house because it feels like it's his, not ours. If I had an OnlyFans I could buy my own house, and clog all the bathrooms every single day.

In any case it's clean enough, so I drift back into half-sleep until he shuts the door. He used to slam the doors when he left in the morning, at 6am. He is inconsiderate like that. But I asked him to stop and he did. 

So he leaves, and I hear him out the front pulling the red bin in from the street. I feel nervous again, what if the bags I left in there discreetly were found. No one wants to stumble upon 4L vomit bottles wrapped in plastic and old clothes. 

I've been here before, three years ago, with old housemates... that was just before everything got good. I hold onto that hope like ice in a fire.

He drives off and the house is empty. I'm awake now, brain whirring, exhausting, before the sun has even risen. A bad night. It's because of those new pills.

I climb out of bed and take three tablets: two long blue, one white capsule. They will knock me out and slow down the fire, plus I can't throw up for an hour after I take them because they need to digest. It's a buffer window, it's helpful.

The hopelessness washes over me like a forcefield, I weaken and break without much of a fight and call my ex-boyfriend on the phone. Always a mistake. He doesn't answer the first four times, but he gets the notifications and unmutes me. I cry on the phone telling him how I feel. He coulsn't care less, he says he's doing just fine. He split town, I have no idea where he is. People are talking in his background. He's wide awake, chirpy. Happier without me. He sounds calm.

I hang up and think I should probably make a plan finally. There's a bag of heroin in a brown cigar box on my desk, low quality herion, heavily cut. I could snort it, but it might not be enough. I fall into dreams of suicide. My favourite is the jumping from a cliff, landing splat on the rocks below. My fear isn't of dying, my fear is that I will survive. If I do it wrong, I'll just be worse off and maybe I wont be able to try again. So it has to be right. Overdose. Gasoline. Jumping. Ocean. 
...
...

10:45am

I wake up again. It takes me a while to orient, I know I'm going to be lazy dazed from the drugs. It's been over an hour, so I take a bag of chocolate honeycomb beside my bed and start eating. 

I do it because there is nothing else in my head, the desire and ambition I once had are dead, the future I held in my hands once is vanquished, my dreams are faded and stale. It's all natural, it's normal. 

I eat to anchor myself in the real world, in the taste, the chewing, the belly filling up and emptying out again. 

I crawl out of bed and walk to the bathroom and vomit up the chocolate honeycomb. I don't even enjoy it anymore. Did I ever? It comes out easily, that's why I like this honeycomb. It's delicious, and interesting, and fun to throw up. It comes out in a big slimy pile, brown sludge in the toilet that I flush away and flush again.

I am swaying walking, the medications fucks my head and I can't see properly. But my mind is slow. I can deal with things like this. I don't have to think, at least right now.

I won't fall back asleep because the sun is bright and the trains are moving and people are up. The energy of the city is bright and awake and it perforates my field and I can't sleep while the restless world is turning, so I turn on the coffee machine in the kitchen and make a coffee. I take two more blue pills, another buffer, 30 minutes until my eyelids grow heavy, and the hum of my brain dims down. I know I'm letting everyone down, but as long as I'm on the drugs, they're far away, they're a blur like the rest of my potential and life.

Everything is stuck in its place. I am cemented, concreted into this hellhole. I can't move an inch. I drink my coffee outside. The ghost and shadows of my ex in his car, pulling up on the street, I see it in my mind. Each car I think is him for a split second. My dad, somewhere, thinking of me. Loving, supportive, claustrophobic. My mum somewhere, stewing silently, prideful and empty inside. Just like me, like everyone. Confused, empty, sold out, unmoveable, stuck in purgatory.

Coffee and Benadryl.

I walk back inside and get into bed. The clank and rumble of the trains, of the traffic. I feel it like a pulse. 

My thoughts come up to take form, shadowy, and they are dissolved by the anti-memory blue pills. But in my body holds every single memory of my life. I live theough them. The drives, the sand and beaches, the friendship, soft eyes, loving eyes, cold mornings camping over frosty grass, community, soul. Terrible things, love, desertment, yearning. I remember the smell of my ex in the images of his bedroom that flash into my mind. He smells like safety, he is my soulmate. His drink, I think of his guts frying from the alcohol. I would sacrifice my life for him in a heartbeat, to support and love him, but he doesn't want me for that or anyone. I don't know if it's morality or stupidity.

12:30pm

I dread my housemate's return at 3pm. He works every day, like clockwork, wakes up without a fight, comes home, buries his feelings and thoughts into the TV or the bathroom or the run. It's a routine. I don't know if he judges me, I barely leave the house. I shouldn't care but I do, it's uncomfortable. I feel watched, analysed, studied.

The blue pill washes my brain in mystery and calm. I think of ways to get more, they only sell them on a certain schedule. I take more than is allowed. I don't want to think. It's inevitable, but I can't relax. I need to relax.

My soul cries electric waves through my deserted body. I made peace with my death back in 2023, with the overdose, I said my goodbyes already. They saved my body, but I am long gone. I'm just waiting. I'm just here, and the cloudd and the air and the streets and the cars move and build around me. Inam stagnant in my memories of friendships forming, dusty old factory bedrooms, caravans, wet, dry, things etch themselves into my subconscious eith chisels and knives. I cannot escape it. Colours, shapes, textures, temperatures, feelings, smells. I miss the wrinky eye smiles, I miss the rough wiry stubble, I miss the tall chested, long limbed, pale skinned, big smile, wide eyes, knowing grin, loving of my ex-lover. 

I miss the rape, I miss the showers, I miss the disrespect, I miss rallying, I miss the passiom, I miss the ground under my feet. I miss my friends.

I miss the tension. I miss my nerve.

I close my eyes to forget but the scene plays out in the dark matrix behind my eyelids.

I crunch biscuits so loud I cannot hear my thoughts, I cannot remember. A dog barks outside. I want it to be over.",1,1756953808.0,counttheheadlights,0,1.0,False
1n7yn0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/evilautism/comments/1n7yn0y/everybody_loves_my_autism_brag/,Everybody loves my autism (brag),"So as I posted before, I've just released my [first ever video essay](https://youtu.be/5t_cYM1cqEo?si=_95Dd0q85He2mZuI), on my special interest (20th century Australian television comedian, Graham Kennedy). I decided to cover his life and work from a queer perspective, which I haven't seen before, despite the fact he was (famously) a closeted gay man. 

And it's blown the fuck up. At the time of writing it has 3.2k views and a bunch of lovely comments (and a few nasty homophobic ones, but I've removed those). An Australian television history archivist has been in contact with me because of it and has been sending me scans of rare Graham Kennedy articles from the TV magazines he owns! I've also been told by the Australian Queer Archives that I can access and peruse archival material they have related to Graham Kennedy! I sent it to my old literature teacher who now wants us to catch up over a coffee and discuss it at length! 

As far as I understand it, it's EXTREMELY rare for a first YouTube video to get the amount of engagement I've been getting, so I guess I've covered the topic pretty bloody well. 

I'm so fucking happy about this. Graham Kennedy is so important to me, I've had a number of hyperfixations and special interests in my life, but nothing has hit me quite so close to my heart as he has. And I've had a number of people say they could see the love and passion and dedication I put into my essay. I'm so glad I get to share my special interest with the world and get such a good response. 

Evil mode: mwahahahahaha Graham Kennedy Guy™ World Domination is upon us! 😈",15,1756953796.0,evilautism,3,1.0,False

I looked back at the kids in their car seats and theyre tucked in, hair brushed, cute outfits, shoes and snacks in their backpacks, bottles filled and ready to go...

Then I looked at myself, no make up, bags under my eyes, hair in the same mum bun for 2 days, ate a handful of crackers & a slice of cheese for breakfast. And can't remember last time I drank a cup of water. 

Be sure to look after yourself too. We sacrifice so much of ourselves for our kids but we deserve to feel somewhat put together too. 2u2 trenches is a wild, demanding and thankless stage of being a parent. 

I've decided I'll be trying a few new ideas to ensure I look after myself too; 
- Eat a snack I actually like without sharing it
- get the kids to dance to a few songs just to give me 10mins of being hands off. 
- going to get myself a notebook to write down random shit I remember so I don't forget. I always think of things and then get frustrated when I forget them cause I'm on the run
- survival, im not going to try and be perfect, just efficient. The kids can eat eggs & fruit 3 days in a row for breakfast they dont care. Pre cut fruit, bulk cook eggs and serve as needed each morning. 
- if baby is sleeping & toddler is busy playing, Im sitting on my ass not cleaning haha chores for hygiene are important like dishes but laundry can wait until later. 
- going to prioritise quick easy snacks like boiled eggs, nuts, cheese sticks, protein bars and pre packaged meals I can microwave. It's only short term until the kids get older and a lean cuisine with chicken & veggies is better than doritos and another coffee. 

We can do thus, I promise you. Please stay strong, this is only a season in life and it will be a distant memory when you're kids are happily playing at the ages of 10&12 etc 🥰💗 ",14,1756953325.0,2under2,0,0.95,False

I’m setting up my first open-air vivarium and I’d love some feedback. My goal is to grow mostly moss, but I might add a few small plants later. Here’s my plan so far (please correct me):

**Setup plan:**

* Drainage layer on the bottom (planning to use aquarium gravel from Amazon)
* Barrier layer on top of that (window screen mesh or a coffee filter)
* Terrarium soil on top as the planting medium
* Will use some branches or rocks to make accents
* Lighting: [LED grow light strips](https://www.amazon.com/Strips-Spectrum-Dimmable-Seedling-Succulent/dp/B0C7T9YB43?pd_rd_w=z6QxT&content-id=amzn1.sym.4af096b2-fb5d-43d2-a23c-ac48118349a2&pf_rd_p=4af096b2-fb5d-43d2-a23c-ac48118349a2&pf_rd_r=WEA79RZT9A5RHX93D52N&pd_rd_wg=X6frB&pd_rd_r=c00b0c14-0ef7-4487-b220-0147adfc7bb5&pd_rd_i=B0C7T9YB43&ref_=pd_basp_d_rpt_ba_s_1_t&th=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Moss: [NEHERP Terrarium Moss Pack](https://www.neherpetoculture.com/moss?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Questions:**

1. Am I on the right track with my methodology, or am I missing any steps?
2. Should I try to get a removable cover to keep humidity in? Any inexpensive ideas for this?
3. How often should I mist a mostly moss setup like this especially at the beginning?
4. is a 12/12 cycle okay for the grow lights?
5. Any other advice/tips that you may have!",1,1756953321.0,terrariums,2,1.0,False

Joint: lands perfectly still lit on the coffee table like “I survived, bitch.”
Phone: somehow recording the whole thing in slo-mo. 📱😂

It said 'Does it matter to a lost boy like you?'
So I walked on, past the rusted gates of heaven
Where the wind still sang someone else's prayers.

I saw flying pandas above the thunder clouds,
Their fur catches sunbeams, melts into aurora streaks.
They pirouette around electric lightning,
Chasing whispers of forgotten lullabies.

Birds sing through orange haze of mystique dawn,
Wings brushing against streaks of neon rain.
God is both an artist and an artiste,
Painting chaos with subtle elegance.

Mermaids serenading forgotten sailors,
Church bells tolling for those who never returned,
Beings of light balancing two suns at right angles,
Lonely hearts being nursed by the sepia angels.

Daydreaming at odd hours,
We sip liquid moonlight from tin cans,
Our shadows flicker against the tiled moon,
Time dissolves like sugar in hot coffee.

Flying pandas call me by my childhood name,
They juggle planets, small and large,
Smiling in riddles, licking starlight from fingertips,
As we try to untangle the meaning of our own hands.

The river was right, time died a long time ago.
I'm still a lost boy but now I have a destiny.
Between the corridors of the golden castle,
I'm playing hide n seek with the flying pandas.

 I've had vertigo and vestibular migraines for years. Sometimes I feel dizzy, but not vertigo.  

These days have been very difficult, I have been very stressed, I work for an IT consultancy and stress is part of everyday life, I have physically somatized all that stress, I get tired and my head hurts after a few minutes of any physical activity, and in moments of maximum stress I feel that it is so much that I feel like it is going to trigger a strong episode of vertigo or that I am going to faint on the keyboard right in the middle of a meeting,

anyway, I had a very stressful meeting at 11 am, it didn't make me dizzy, I went to the doctor at noon, he prescribed me B complex injections and gave me the first of 5 injections, everything was fine for a few hours, I even felt better, but at 3 pm I had a long and very stressful job interview, when I finished the meeting, I was very nervous, I felt tremors in my body as if I had drunk too much coffee, and a couple of hours later I had extremely strong dizziness, not vertigo, but the dizziness had the same devastating effect on my body as if it had been an episode of vertigo

I couldn't walk without having to hold onto the walls, I lay down and after a few hours I felt better and woke up much better the next day, just with a slight dizziness, but I don't know what could have caused it,

 I don't know if it was a side effect of the injection or it's still due to stress, or both, now I'm afraid to get the injection tomorrow because I don't want to feel bad, since I have an appointment with the psychiatrist tomorrow and I don't want to miss it, what do you think it was?

We met in 2016 when we both had partners and flirted and talked on and off until 2 years ago. I left my girlfriend and she left her husband. Won’t go into detail but she just said they were mostly just friends and she didn’t really love him. She makes me feel loved and the relationship is great - except for my suspicions about said previous husband. They are still best friends and talk and they have a daughter together. I worry they are too close and recently we bought a house. He picks his daughter up for school every morning and a few times I have noticed that there are 2 coffee mugs in the sink when she’s the only one home. My one rule is he doesn’t come inside when I’m not there and now I think he is. I asked her about it and she was just like “yeah I don’t know” and “no I would never let him in without you being here”. Part of me rationalizes it; that they are friends and have a daughter and they are going to talk. Another part of me is suspicious and always looking for clues or whatever that she’s cheating or whatever; always trying to catch glimpses of her phone when she’s on it or thinking she’s talking to him as soon as I’m not around. We have had discussions about this before and I’ve made a lot of progress but there are good days and bad days.

it scares me to imagine myself 40 years down the line still reminiscing on the times we spent together. reminiscing on your smile, the slight stains on your front teeth, that i assume are from the coffee and cigarettes you love. reminiscing on your chest, the way i’d sink into it. nothing has ever made me feel safer.

i never stop wondering how much of it was real. when you held me and kissed every inch of my body, did you feel it in the same way i did? was it love? or was i nothing more than a distraction, an easy target to feast on? i question every moment we shared. after the breakup, you told our friend you had lost feelings early into the relationship but were too afraid to say anything in fear of hurting me.

i find it frustrating when people say i was in love with a version of a person i created in my head. that sentiment implies that i was somehow blind to who you are. but i loved every last bit of you. i loved you for all your disagreeable qualities, not despite them. i loved you despite your disdain for me. i knew the ugly, i lived the ugly.

i knew i loved you very early on, but it become especially clear when you broke things off. i’ve always been the kind of girl who completely erases her previous partners from her life. i couldn’t bare to encounter them again. with you, though, i would’ve given anything to have maintained a connection with you, even if it was platonic.

i tried my absolute best to hold on to you. it took me a while to realize i’d been slowly losing you for while, thread by thread.",1,1756952177.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

***New York Stock Exchange,NYC.***

***October, 19, 1987***



Harvey looked out onto the Manhattan skyline as he took a drag of his cigarette.He thought back to his days at Yale, how he and his fraternity threw the best parties on campus, he smiled and let out a small chuckle.Those days were far past him, now he was Vice President of Equiteys trading at Solesman Brothers, with a new mansion in New Jersey, and bombshell of a wife.He was living the american dream.



Before he could podder some more a voice came from behind him.



“Harvey!”the voice shouted.



Harvey turned around to see Adam, his coworker and closest friend.Both of them had started at the firm the same year, both were from Rhode Island.Naturally they became close, almost like brothers.



“Adam, what's going on?”Harvey asked jovially



“The meeting with the director is about start.”Adam said with a smug grin.""Can’t start without the VP.”



“Your VP too,”Harvey said jokingly.



“I know, but it's fun to bust your balls.”Adam said with a smile and chuckle.



The two made their way back inside, and down the hall towards the meeting [room.As](http://room.As) they walked Harvery looked to his left to see the trading floor.""It looks like a jungle down there.”He thought.



 He never really enjoyed being down on the floor,grown men acting like wild animals never made him feel comfortable.The only thing he liked about the floor was the money.That was his reason for anything really.Money made the world go round, and as long as the money flowed so did society.



Adam opened the door to the meeting room, inside sat the management of the firm and the director himself.



“Perfect, now that everyone's here, I think it's time to begin.”The director said in his usual ""let's get down to business"" tone, the same tone he used to start the firm in the first place.“As you know, with the soviet economy in the shitter, some of our investments overseas are in jeopardy.I've been told most of the investments in Europe and Central America have been secured, but Africa and Asia are starting to get a bit rocky, we need to-”



Just then a new associate burst through the door, panting and sweating like the building was one fire.



“Whats the meaning of this, we are in a very important meet-”The director was interrupted once more”Its the Dow Jones sir!”The associate, still panting, said the line that would change everything.""It's down, it's down 22.6%!”



The room went completely silent, everyone sat for what felt like ages.



“Jesus Fucking Christ.”One of the VP’s said before stumbling over his chair and rushing out.Another one followed, and another until the meeting room layed a mess of scattered papers, flipped chairs, and spilled coffee.



Adam and Harvey made their way to the trading floor only to see it. The floor was in chaos, not the usual screaming to sell and celebrating as before.No, now everyone was yelling, panicking, some were even crying.



Everything was in the red, from lumber to car manufacturing.All it took was a couple hours to wipe it all away.All Harvey could do was stand and look at the glowing monitors as it showed the worsening stock prices.



“Harvery!”Adam yelled, shaking Harvey.""We need to go.”



What followed was hours of meetings, calls with clients, and smoking cigarettes, all of which had been but a blur to harvey.In the span of a morning Harvery’s world shattered, With the Federal chairman refusing to act and the ever increasing downward spiral of global stock prices one thing became clear to Harvey.



**There's no coming back from this.**
